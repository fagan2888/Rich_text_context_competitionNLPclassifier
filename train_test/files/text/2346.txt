IMPORTANCE People with substance dependence have health consequences, high health
care utilization, and frequent comorbidity but often receive poor-quality care. Chronic care
management (CCM) has been proposed as an approach to improve care and outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether CCM for alcohol and other drug dependence improves
substance use outcomes compared with usual primary care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The AHEAD study, a randomized trial conducted among
563 people with alcohol and other drug dependence at a Boston, Massachusetts,
hospital-based primary care practice. Participants were recruited from September 2006 to
September 2008 from a freestanding residential detoxification unit and referrals from an
urban teaching hospital and advertisements; 95% completed 12-month follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to receive CCM (n=282) or no CCM (n=281).
Chronic care management included longitudinal care coordinated with a primary care
clinician; motivational enhancement therapy; relapse prevention counseling; and on-site
medical, addiction, and psychiatric treatment, social work assistance, and referrals (including
mutual help). The no CCM (control) group received a primary care appointment and a list of
treatment resources including a telephone number to arrange counseling.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was self-reported abstinence from
opioids, stimulants, or heavy drinking. Biomarkers were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS There was no significant difference in abstinence from opioids, stimulants, or heavy
drinking between the CCM (44%) and control (42%) groups (adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95%
CI, 0.65-1.10; P=.21). No significant differences were found for secondary outcomes of
addiction severity, health-related quality of life, or drug problems. No subgroup effects were
found except among those with alcohol dependence, in whom CCM was associated with
fewer alcohol problems (mean score, 10 vs 13; incidence rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.00;
P=.048).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among persons with alcohol and other drug dependence,
CCM compared with a primary care appointment but no CCM did not increase self-reported
abstinence over 12 months. Whether more intensive or longer-duration CCM is effective
requires further investigation.

Alcohol and other drug dependence can be chronic dis-
eases, but they are usually treated episodically.1 Few
seek treatment,2 and most who do do not complete it.3
Barriers to care range from impaired motivation to seek help
to health care organizational impediments, including poor co-
ordination of care for common co-occurring conditions.4,5
Treatments for substance dependence, particularly lon-
gitudinal ones, have efficacy.6 Although primary care set-
tings are designed to address most health care needs with lon-
gitudinal, comprehensive, and coordinated care and are
therefore logical settings in which to manage chronic illness
like addiction, they have not adequately addressed sub-
stancedependence.5 Themainapproachtocare--referraltoad-
dictiontreatmentprograms--hasbeenunsuccessfullargelybe-
cause patients do not go to them.4
Chronic care management (CCM) has efficacy for chronic
medical and mental health conditions.7-12 Current health care
reformapproachestoimprovingcarequalityandloweringcosts
for patients with chronic illness have turned to CCM as a
solution.13,14 The focus for
implementation has been
the primary care patient-
centered medical home.15
Chronic care manage-
ment is multidisciplinary
patient-centered proac-
tive care, a way to orga-
nize services that pro-
vides coordination and
expertise,andhasbeenef-
fective for depression,
medical illnesses, and to-
bacco dependence (a substance use disorder).9-12 Trials of in-
tegrated medical and addiction care have shown some suc-
cess and suggest that CCM has potential for addiction,16-19
particularly since care elements long known to be effective for
addiction overlap with CCM approaches. We have made the
case for why CCM should be implemented in primary care and
be effective,7 but no large randomized trials have been pub-
lished testing the effectiveness of CCM in primary care for sub-
stance dependence.18
Methods
Study Design
The Addiction Health Evaluation and Disease Management
(AHEAD) study was a randomized trial comparing the effect
of CCM vs usual primary care for patients with alcohol or drug
dependence. The study was originally designed as 2 trials--a
study of CCM for alcohol dependence and a study of CCM for
drug dependence. For efficiency in implementation and to
maximize power, the studies were implemented as 1 trial en-
rolling participants with alcohol or drug dependence.
Participants
StudyparticipantswererecruitedfromSeptember2006toSep-

(n=416; 74%), referrals from an urban teaching hospital and ad-
vertisements (n=53 outpatient, n=4 emergency department,
n=2 hospital inpatient, and n=88 advertisements and other re-
ferrals; 26%).
Inclusion criteria were (1) age 18 years or older; (2) alco-
hol dependence (determined by the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview Short Form [CIDI-SF])20 and
heavy drinking in the past 30 days (for men, 5 drinks [13.7 g
of ethanol each] on 1 occasion at least twice or 22
drinks/wk in an average week; 4 drinks on 1 occasion at
least twice or 15 drinks/wk for women) or CIDI-SF diagno-
sis of drug dependence and past 30-day use of psychostimu-
lants (cocaine, methamphetamine, or prescription amphet-
amine misuse) or heroin or prescription opioid misuse (with
misuse defined as use without a prescription, in larger
amounts than prescribed, or for a longer period than pre-
scribed); and (3) willingness to continue or establish pri-
mary care at an urban hospital-based practice. Exclusion
criteria were (1) inability to be interviewed due to acute ill-
ness; (2) breath alcohol level of 100 mg/dL or higher
(Alco-sensor IV Breathalyzer; Intoximeter Inc); (3) inability
to provide contact information for 2 persons; (4) lack
of fluency in English or Spanish; (5) cognitive impairment
(score <21 of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination)21;
and (6) pregnancy.
Participants provided written informed consent and
received compensation. The Institutional Review Board of
Boston University Medical Campus and Boston Medical
Center approved the study, including follow-up of incarcer-
ated participants, and we obtained a Certificate of Confiden-
tiality from the National Institutes of Health. Participants
were compensated on completion of study procedures (not
for any clinical visits) ($35 at baseline, $50 at 3-month, $50
at 6-month, and $75 at 12-month research contacts), and $2
each time they updated their contact information. Partici-
pants were offered a meal and reimbursement for transpor-
tation at each study visit.

Randomization
After the baseline assessment and via a central secure web-
site (providing allocation concealment), participants were ran-
domly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the CCM inter-
vention or usual primary care as a control condition using
random permuted blocks of sizes 6 and 8 stratified by depen-
dence and recent use status (ie, alcohol, drug, or both).
Chronic Care Management
Chronic care management for substance dependence was de-
livered at the AHEAD study clinic located in a primary care
clinic. Chronic care management included longitudinal care
for substance dependence and related medical and psychiat-
ric comorbidities and coordination of specialty medical, psy-
chiatric, and addiction care with primary medical care as
needed, facilitated by a shared electronic health record that
had specifically created forms. Clinicians maintained a regis-
try and proactively reengaged patients who missed follow-up
for any reason.
The AHEAD clinic was staffed by a multidisciplinary team
separate from any primary care staff, including a nurse care
manager (NCM), a social worker, and internists (who did not
deliver primary care for these participants) and a psychiatrist
with addiction expertise. All clinic staff were on site 2 half-
days a week for new and follow-up visits. The NCM and social
worker were on site the remaining weekdays; physicians were
available for consultation.
Intervention participants were asked to attend 2 AHEAD
clinic visits (90 minutes each), separated by 3 to 4 days, re-
ceiving substance use, psychiatric, medical, and social assess-
ments by all 4 clinicians. The main focus of these visits was to
engage participants so they would return for ongoing care.
Treatments for addiction and for medical and psychiatric con-
ditions were begun depending on participants' diagnoses and
readiness/priorities. Clinicians were provided with the CIDI-SF
and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire results but no other
researchassessmentresults.Participantswereescortedtotheir
first visit as soon as possible after randomization. Partici-
pants were offered 4 sessions of motivational enhancement
therapy with a social worker (who used the Mini-Mental State
Examination, SIP, and liver enzyme measurements for pa-
tient feedback),32 relapse prevention counseling at every con-
tact by whichever clinician they saw, usually the NCM or so-
cial worker (which includes assessment of substance use),33 a
primary care appointment, and referral to specialty addic-
tion treatment and mutual help groups, all tailored to clinical
needs and patient preferences. Addiction pharmacotherapy
(naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, buprenorphine, and re-
ferral for methadone) and psychopharmacotherapy were of-
fered as appropriate.
Continuing care was delivered during the follow-up
period, including clinic visits, NCM contacts by telephone,
facilitated referrals to addiction specialty care, drop-in care,
and 24-hour pager access. Because participants had varied
diagnoses, severity, priorities, and readiness for treatments,
care was individualized and there was no set number of vis-
its (which could be counterproductive if required against a
participant's desires). In general, however, it was common
for participants to return in a week after the first 2 visits to
check on progress, complete paperwork needed for social
services, transition to additional addiction treatment, begin
addiction or psychiatric pharmacotherapy, and/or receive
addiction or mental health counseling. If patients did not
appear for visits for a month, the NCM contacted them to
reengage.
Usual Primary Care
Participants in the control group were given a timely appoint-
ment with a named primary care physician and a list of addic-
tion treatment resources. They had no access to the AHEAD
clinic. They were also given a telephone number to access 4
motivational enhancement therapy sessions. The rationale for
this access was to have all services available to both groups so
thetrialwouldtestCCM,notspecificclinicalinterventions,and
motivational enhancement therapy was not routinely avail-
able outside the study; 9 control participants (3%) had a ses-
sion.
Participant Assessment at Follow-up
Assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 12 months after en-
rollment, usually in person. The last participant follow-up
assessment was on January 21, 2010. At 6 months, percent
disialocarbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) and -glutam-
yltransferase (GGT) tests were done, and saliva and hair
samples were tested for drugs (saliva for opioids, cocaine,
methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, and tetrahydrocan-
nabinol by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [Friends
Medical Laboratory Inc] within a 1- to 3-day window34; hair for
opioids and cocaine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
and gas chromatographyÂ­mass spectroscopy [Psychemedics
Corp] within a 90-day window).
In the first year of the study, CDT and GGT measurements
were obtained only for those with baseline heavy alcohol use
and dependence, and hair and saliva were tested for those with
drug use and dependence; thereafter, all were tested because
it became financially feasible to do so and having data on all
subsequent participants was thought to be better than not hav-
ing it.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was self-reported 30-day abstinence
from stimulants, opioids, and heavy alcohol use (four or more
13.7-gethanoldrinksforwomenand5drinksformeninaday)
at 3, 6, and 12 months. Stimulant (cocaine, amphetamine) and
opioid (heroin, other opioid misuse) use were assessed by the
ASI.23 Alcohol use was assessed using the 30-day timeline fol-
low-back calendar method.22 Additional outcomes of particu-
lar interest were 30-day abstinence from stimulants, opioids,
and any alcohol use; alcohol and drug problems (measured by
the SIP-2R and SIP-D); any hospitalization; and any emer-
gency department visits. Other outcomes were CDT 1.7% or
higher, GGT 66 IU/L or higher; detection of opioids or cocaine
by hair testing and detection of cocaine, opioids, or metham-
phetamine by saliva testing; alcohol and drug addiction se-
verity (measured by the ASI); number of heavy drinking days;

mary [MCS] and Physical Component Summary [PCS] scores;
range, 0-100; 100 represents best health); and addiction treat-
ment utilization (including mutual help group meeting atten-
dance [eg, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous], in-
patient or outpatient addiction treatment, and medication for
addiction [eg, buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone, acam-
prosate, disulfiram]).
Statistical Analysis
Although longitudinal regression models were used in the
analyses, for the purposes of power calculations a simpler
setting using a single time point was considered (we antici-
pated that this was conservative because the power for
the longitudinal analysis would be higher). It was assumed
that 30% of control group participants would be abstinent
at follow-up. This estimate was based on both the
literature6,16,17,35 and a previous randomized clinical trial con-
ducted by the authors testing the effectiveness of a multidis-
ciplinary clinic at a detoxification unit.36 We hypothesized
that the proportion in the intervention group with abstinence
would be 50% (ie, an absolute difference of 20% between
groups). Allowing for 25% attrition from 320 participants in
each of the alcohol and drug dependence subgroups, the
study provided 86% power to detect a 20% between-group
difference in the proportions with abstinence from drug and
heavy alcohol use for each subgroup (2-sided =.05), The
study was therefore expected to have greater power to detect
the same effect size in the full sample. Recruitment did not
continue to the originally planned 640 participants because
some participants had both alcohol and drug dependence.
The combined study exceeded the originally planned sample
sizes (and follow-up rates) for each of the separate sub-
samples (n=413 with alcohol dependence; n=465 with drug
dependence).
The primary outcome was analyzed using generalized es-
timating equation (GEE) logistic regression models adjusting
for dependence and recent use status (alcohol, drug, or both,
the randomization stratification variable) and time. The time-
averagedeffectoftheinterventionwasthemaininterestinthis
study,andtheresultsreportedintheprimaryanalysesaremain
effects from models that do not include interaction terms. An
independence working correlation was used and empirical
standard errors are reported for all GEE analyses. Confirma-
tory analyses were performed adjusting for race and depres-
sive symptoms, 2 factors that differed significantly between
groups at baseline. Additional binary outcomes were ana-
lyzed using the same approach. For the continuous outcomes
of SF-12 Mental and Physical Component Summary scores, we
fit linear mixed-effects regression models. Number of heavy
drinking days was analyzed using GEE overdispersed Poisson
models.
For alcohol and drug problems (SIP-2R and SIP-D scores)
andforASIdrugandalcoholscores,thedistributionswerenon-
normal and appropriate transformations were not found.
Therefore,SIP-2RandSIP-Dscores,nonnegativeintegers,were
analyzedusingGEEoverdispersedPoissonmodelsbecausethe
variance exceeded the mean. Confirmatory analyses were also
performed using negative binomial regression models and lin-
ear mixed-effects models, and the results were consistent
across all models for both the SIP-2R and SIP-D scores. For ASI
drug and alcohol scores, each outcome was categorized into
multiple ordered categories and analyzed using GEE propor-
tional odds models. Biological outcomes were analyzed using
logistic regression models.
All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat ba-
sis,whereinstudyparticipantswereanalyzedaccordingtoran-
domized group regardless of whether they received their as-
signed intervention. Missing data were not imputed; only the
observed data were used. However, a sensitivity analysis was
conducted using multiple imputation to address missing fol-
low-updatafortheprimaryoutcomeofabstinencefromstimu-
lants, opioids, and heavy alcohol use. Baseline variables used
in the imputation were dependence and recent use status (al-
cohol, drug, or both), randomized group, age, sex, and race.
A prioriÂ­defined subgroup analyses for the above outcomes
were conducted among those with alcohol dependence and
those with drug dependence.
In post hocÂ­defined subgroups, we analyzed interven-
tion effects among baseline opioid and stimulant users in the
drug dependence subgroup separately. In analyses of the pri-
mary outcome, we also tested interactions between the inter-
vention and time, medical comorbidity, substance abuseÂ­
related medical comorbidities, intention to change alcohol or
drug use, homelessness, SF-12 Mental Component Summary
score, addiction treatment in past 3 months, and recruitment
site, but there were no meaningful interactions (eTables 1-4 in
the Supplement). In an exploratory analysis, we tested the ef-
fect of the number of AHEAD clinic visits using the longitudi-
nal regression models described above. All analyses were con-
ducted using 2-sided tests and a significance level of P<.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
Enrollment and Follow-up
Of the 2029 people screened, 1374 were ineligible (Figure). Of
the 655 eligible participants, 563 (86%) were randomized. At
least 1 follow-up interview was conducted for 98% (553/563)
of participants (no significant difference between groups).
Baseline characteristics of the study participants (Table 1) were
similar between randomization groups but differed signifi-
cantly for race and depressive symptoms. Both groups im-
proved over time on a number of measures.
Receipt of the Intervention
Of the 282 participants assigned to the intervention group, 281
(99.6%) attended at least 1 CCM clinic visit, 75.9% attended at
least 2, and 64.5% attended 3 or more visits (median, 6 visits;
interquartile range, 2-16 visits). Most reported scores consis-
tent with receipt of high-quality CCM at 12 months (75% had
scores 3.3 on a scale adapted to assess addiction CCM; pos-
sible range, 1-5).37 Most (62%) received 1 or more motiva-
tionalenhancementtherapysessionsand27%completed4ses-
sions.

Main Results
For the primary outcome of abstinence from stimulants, opi-
oids, and heavy drinking, there was no significant difference
between the CCM intervention group and the control group
(44% vs 42%, respectively, at 12 months; adjusted odds ratio
[OR] for intervention vs control across the 12-month follow-
up, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65-1.10; P=.21) (Table 2). There were also
no significant differences in other outcomes.
In the alcohol and drug dependence subgroups (Table 2),
therewerenosignificantdifferencesovertimeexceptforfewer
alcohol problems (measured by the SIP-2R) in the interven-
tiongroupamongthosewithalcoholdependence(meanscore,
10.4 vs 13.1 at 12 months; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.85; 95%
CI, 0.72-1.00; P=.048).
In sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome of absti-
nence from drugs and heavy drinking using multiple imputa-
tion to account for missing observations, no significant dif-
ference was observed for the intervention vs control groups
(OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.07; P=.19).
Opioid and Stimulant Subgroups
Among those with drug dependence and recent use of opi-
oids(n=369),theinterventionwasassociatedwithalowerodds
of opioid abstinence throughout follow-up (52% vs 54% at 12
months; OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51-0.98) but had no effect on days
of opioid use (mean, 16.7 vs 14.0 days for intervention and con-
trol at 12 months, respectively; IRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.94-1.52 in
an analysis adjusted for baseline use)). Among those with drug
dependence and recent use of stimulants (n=364), there were
nosignificantinterventioneffectsonstimulantabstinence(51%
vs 55% at 12 months; OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.56-1.07) or days of
stimulantuse(mean,11.0vs12.4daysforinterventionandcon-
trol at 12 months, respectively; IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.81-1.37 in
an analysis adjusted for baseline use).
Biological Tests
Allbiomarkeranalyses(hairandsalivadrugtests,CDT,andGGT
at 6 months) showed similar nonsignificant results. These in-
cluded subgroup analyses by substance dependence as well
as separate analyses of baseline opioid and stimulant users in
the drug dependence sample). In the full sample, ORs for the
association between intervention and a negative test result
were1.20(95%CI,0.76-1.90;n=417;30%ininterventionvs27%
in control) for hair, 1.07 (95% CI, 0.70-1.62; n=491; 74% in in-
tervention vs 73% in control) for saliva, 1.27 (95% CI, 0.77-
2.08; n=420; 80% in intervention vs 78% in control) for CDT,
and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.54-1.54; n=428; 83% in intervention vs 85%
in control) for GGT.
Addiction Treatment Utilization
The intervention was significantly associated with greater re-
ceipt of addiction treatment and addiction medication but not
mutual help group attendance (Table 3).
Exposure to Intervention
AHEAD clinic visit exposure was significantly associated with
the secondary abstinence outcome (less with 1-2 vs 0 visits;
more with 3 vs 1-2 visits) but not other outcomes (Table 4).
Discussion
This study did not find an effect of CCM for substance depen-
dence on substance use, related consequences (with the ex-
ceptionofasmalleffectonalcoholproblemsamongthosewith
dependence),health-relatedqualityoflife,oracutehealthcare
utilization.
Chronic care management has demonstrated efficacy for
manymedicalandmentalhealthconditions.Chroniccareman-
agementshouldworkforsubstancedependencebecauseitcan
help overcome system and individual barriers to care (eg, un-
coordinated services in separate locations and systems; im-
paired motivation to seek help; mental and physical comor-
bidities). Components of CCM have been effective for
addictions (eg, case management, co-location, and integra-
tion of care),7 but CCM for addiction in primary care has not
been tested in a randomized trial.18 Willenbring and Olson16
demonstrated efficacy (abstinence, mortality) of co-location
of care for medically ill veterans with alcoholism in a special
alcohol clinic. Weisner et al17 demonstrated efficacy (absti-
nence)ofdeliveringprimarymedicalcareatanaddictionstreat-
mentprogramforasubgroupofpatientswithsubstanceabuseÂ­
related medical conditions. In a secondary analysis at 5 years,
integrated care was associated with abstinence or use with-
out problems in the whole sample.38
Chronic care management has been described as includ-
ing6elements,allofwhicharerepresentedintheAHEADclinic
and are elements in which staff were trained: use of commu-
nity resources, making the chronic illness and its manage-
ment the priority, self-management support, delivery system
design, decision support, and use of clinical information
systems.7-10,39 The social worker addressed or connected pa-
tients to community services to assist with legal, social, and
financial needs. She and the NCM connected patients to ad-
diction treatment and mutual help groups in the community
with the ability for "warm handoffs" by knowing individuals
who work in or go to those resources. Substance dependence
was the focus of the clinic, as documented by specific care
plans. Self-management was encouraged by provision of rou-
tineassessmentandfeedback.Withpsychosocialsupportfrom
clinicstaff,patientswereencouragedtoparticipateintheircare.
Motivationalinterviewingwasusedroutinelyemphasizingthe
patient's role.
Chronic care management provided on-site services with
connections to off-site services, use of patient reminders and
planned visits, and multidisciplinary collaboration of team
members. Decision support was available through easily ac-
cessible expert clinician consultation. Information systems
were used to communicate with primary care physicians (out-
side the AHEAD clinic), for a standard visit template, for a reg-
istry function to track patients to encourage follow-up and to
tracktreatments,andtomonitoroutcomes(eg,substanceuse).
The elements of CCM could be implemented differently or to
a greater extent but our and our clinicians' experience sug-
gests that we implemented all of the components. Partici-
pant reports were consistent with delivery of high-quality
CCM.37 Nonetheless, future studies could test other ways of

implementing CCM for addiction that might have efficacy. For
example, self-management and outcome monitoring could be
bolstered by routine biomarker testing, visit schedules could
be more prescriptive, or specific care pathways more de-
tailed. Future studies should also consider the possibility that
CCM is simply insufficient and that more intensive recovery
support in the community needs to be added.
Our study, however, suggests that CCM for substance de-
pendence in primary care is not effective, at least not as imple-
mented in this study and population. Several explanations
shouldbeconsideredfortheseunexpectedfindings.First,sub-
stancedependencetreatmenthaslimitedefficacy;itmaybedif-
ficult to detect effects of better delivery of existing treatments.
Pharmacotherapyefficacyisvaried--itishighlyeffectiveforopi-
oid dependence,40 but for alcohol dependence it yields abso-
lute risk differences for heavy drinking and abstinence of 8%
to11%,35 andithasnoefficacyforstimulants.Psychosocialtreat-
mentshaveefficacy,thoughthesetooarevaried,andmoststud-
ies lack no-treatment control groups.6 Combination psycho-
therapy yielded a 6% absolute risk improvement in percentage
of days abstinent compared with medical counseling.41 Weiss
etal42 foundnodetectablebenefitofdrugcounselingoverstan-
dardmedicalmanagementofbuprenorphine-naloxone.Chronic
care management in our study did increase receipt of addic-
tion treatment (by 7%-10%) but this was likely insufficient. We
believe that the small increase in use of addiction treatments
that are modestly efficacious for only some subsets of people
with addictions and limited delivery of evidence-based prac-
tices for addiction in the community were likely the main rea-
sons for our findings.
Second, although adherence to treatment is a problem for
all people with chronic illnesses, it is particularly important
for those with addictions. Most people with addictions do not
seek help.2 Even when they do, their substance use directly
affects their motivation and ability to adhere to care. Third,
many people with addictions have co-occurring mental health
conditions and substantial social problems. Although CCM is
designed to address complex problems, it may simply not be
enough to overcome the impaired motivation and myriad se-
vere consequences experienced by patients with addictions.
Methodologicalconsiderationsmightalsoexplainthefind-
ings. Most study participants were dependent on both alco-
hol and other drugs, recruited from a detoxification unit, had
substantial mental health symptoms, had recently been home-
less, and were not necessarily seeking addiction treatment (de-
spite relatively high reported readiness to change their use).
The findings may not apply to addiction treatmentÂ­seeking or
less severely affected populations or to populations recruited
elsewhere. Although an effect is plausible, our analyses found
no impact on the intervention efficacy of any of these factors.
Furthermore, studies of CCM for other conditions have se-
lected severely affected patients with comorbidity and social
needs because they are the ones who need the services and
could benefit, and these studies have found efficacy.11 Among
people with addictions seeking treatment, favorable out-
comes are already good without CCM (eg, 74% with no heavy
drinkingorproblemswithalcoholismpharmacotherapy).41 The
needforwhatCCMoffersisgreatestforthosewithsevere,com-
plex problems, who are not the easiest to engage in care.
Aswithpriortrials,16,17 weassessedmainoutcomesbyself-
report. Biological tests are inadequate for detecting sub-
stance use, particularly when it is not recent. Substance use
problems and health-related quality of life are best assessed
by self-report. We used validated tools, assured participants

of confidentiality, and corroborated main results with biologi-
cal tests (informing participants of testing) and a range of other
outcomes, all of which were consistent.
Low intervention potency seems an unlikely explanation
fortheresults.Weimplementedallelementsofpreviouslysuc-
cessful CCM, trained experienced staff for the study, and pro-
vided systems support and ample availability for patients. Un-
insurance was not a barrier. Intervention participants had, on
average, 6 CCM visits and reported high-quality CCM, and the
intervention increased exposure to addiction treatment and
pharmacotherapy.
Assessment effects, the list of resources, primary care ap-
pointment, or the 3% of controls who received 1 or more mo-
tivational enhancement counseling sessions could have bi-
ased the study to the null. However, those minimal control
group exposures and relatively less intense assessments of 6
hours over a year (compared with longer ones in positive al-
cohol treatment trials) are unlikely to have had a major effect
on a severely affected group.41 Of note, the whole group im-
proved over time; the change most likely was due to many par-
ticipants having been enrolled at a detoxification unit, when
they were at a more severe point in their addiction and sought
some help (a logical time to offer CCM). Assessment effects in
treatment trials are inconsistent and poorly understood43 and
often absent in studies of people not seeking treatment.44 Con-
tamination is also an unlikely explanation of our findings be-
cause controls had no access to addiction CCM in the study or
elsewhere.
Chronic care management for substance dependence had
a small effect on problems among those with alcohol depen-
dence but was ineffective for improving substance use, re-
lated clinical outcomes, or health care utilization. Providing
more intensive or longer-duration CCM might be effective, or
it might be effective for less severe primary care patients or
small subgroups of patients with low severity and few comor-
bidities or social problems who are eager to enter addiction
care. It is also possible that the effects of CCM for addiction
will not be seen until the health system in which it is imple-
mented is more supportive of integrated care.
Current health care reforms in the United States include a
focus on CCM as a solution in patient-centered medical homes
to reduce chronic disease burden and to reduce costs (both of
which are among the highest for those with addiction), in part
because numerous studies have found such benefits for medi-
cal and mental health conditions.14 The model is being widely
disseminated in primary care settings by private and govern-
ment health plans, health care delivery organizations, and
health policy leaders anticipating accountable care organiza-

alcohol- and drug-related problems, physical healthÂ­related quality of life, and
the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptoms. For 3
visits vs 1 to 2 visits, the odds ratio was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.00-2.38).
d Odds ratio and 95% CI from generalized estimating equation logistic
regression model adjusting for time point, age, sex, race, homelessness,
alcohol- and drug-related problems, physical healthÂ­related quality of life, and
the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptoms. For 3
visits vs 1 to 2 visits, the odds ratio was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.12-2.71).
e ASI alcohol score >0.4 represents the top 2 of 5 ordered categories used for
analysis. Odds ratio is for a 1-category improvement (ie, lower ASI alcohol
score) in alcohol addiction severity.
f Odds ratio and 95% CI from generalized estimating equation proportional
odds regression model adjusting for the same covariates predicting a lower
addiction severity score category.
g ASI drug score >0.2 represents the top 2 of 5 ordered categories used for
analysis. Odds ratio is for a 1-category improvement (ie, lower ASI drug score)
in drug addiction severity.

tionsandnewsupportforCCMelements.Leadingnationalcen-
ters on both CCM13 and integrated care (www.integration
.samhsa.gov) are expanding the model to address substance
disorders. In the absence of randomized trials for substance-
dependent patients, benefits of CCM are being anticipated and
implementation is proceeding. Our findings at least raise the
possibility that not all chronic diseases are the same and that
CCM may not have the same effect across conditions for which
complexity varies, a possibility that should be part of the con-
versation when models of care are implemented widely. Even
though CCM is effective for a number of chronic conditions,
it may be premature to assume that CCM will be the solution
to improve the quality of care for and reduce costs of patients
with addiction. Further research is warranted to determine
whether more intensive or longer-duration CCM or CCM de-
signed differently might do so.
Conclusion
In this trial of persons with alcohol and other drug depen-
dence, CCM, compared with a primary care appointment but
no CCM, did not decrease use or overall addiction conse-
quences.
