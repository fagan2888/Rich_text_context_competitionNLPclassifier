Abstract
Background. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
and kidney disease may have shared risk factors, including
cardiovascular disease risk factors; additionally AMD and
dense deposit disease share a common causal link, with
both associated with polymorphisms in the complement
pathway. Accordingly, we explored a population-based co-
hort of US adults to examine if markers of kidney disease
identify a higher risk population for prevalent AMD.
Methods. A cross-sectional nested case­control study
matching on age, sex and race was performed using data
on adult participants in the Third National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey. Predictor variables included
urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR). Study outcomes included late AMD,
defined as neovascular disease or geographic atrophy (5:1
matching), and a composite of both early AMD, defined as
soft drusen or pigment irregularities with or without any
drusen, and late AMD (1:1 matching).
Results. There were 51 participants with late AMD and
865 with any AMD. In conditional logistic regression ad-
justing for diabetes, hypertension and total cholesterol,
lower eGFR was independently associated with late AMD
[odds ratio (OR) ¼ 3.05, 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.51­6.13], while albuminuria was not significant. For any
AMD, neither albuminuria nor eGFR were significant in ad-
justed models. In sensitivity analyses excluding diabetics,
albuminuria was associated with any AMD (OR ¼ 1.56,
95% CI: 1.11­1.29 and 1.57, 95% CI: 0.61­3.69 for micro-
and macroalbuminuria, respectively, P ¼ 0.03).
Conclusions. Late AMD is more common among individ-
uals with reduced kidney function. Whether this associa-
tion reflects a common causal pathway or shared
risk factors such as hypertension requires additional
investigation.

Introduction
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common
disease in older adults and may have shared risk factors
with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including associations

with cardiovascular disease. It also has shared causal path-
ways with several diseases affecting the kidney, including
dense deposit disease (also referred to as Type II membra-
noproliferative glomerulonephritis) and atypical hemolytic
uremic syndrome (aHUS) [1­3]. AMD is a degenerative
disease of the macula marked by drusen deposition; these
are similar to the deposits seen in dense deposit disease.
Many polymorphisms in the Factor H gene are associated
with AMD and its progression [4, 5], and several of these
polymorphisms have been noted in cases of dense deposit
disease, often in conjunction with other polymorphisms
affecting the alternative pathway of complement activation
[1, 6­8]. Despite similar genetics, these conditions are
distinct pathological entities, indicating the existence of a
peculiar genotype­phenotype relationship. Notably, AMD
and dense deposit disease have pathological similarities,
namely accumulation of complement-containing debris
within the eye and kidney, respectively. Not surprisingly,
AMD-like pathology is often present in individuals with
dense deposit disease [9].
AMD can be classified as early or late, with these strata
often representing disparate disease states. Early AMD
consists of drusen and pigment irregularities, but many
early cases do not progress to the advanced form. Late
AMD is far less frequent but most visually significant.
Previously identified risk factors including smoking, obe-
sity and genetic factors, are more strongly associated with
late AMD [10], although there is also substantial overlap
between cardiovascular disease risk factors and both early
and late AMD, potentially implying that impairment of the
choroidal circulation may be involved in the pathogenesis
of the disease [11].
Perhaps reflecting either a shared genetic predisposition or
an association with cardiovascular disease risk factors, recent
literature has identified an association between AMD and
reduced kidney function in large cohort studies [12, 13], while
a large case­control study using administrative data describes
an association between diabetic nephropathy (independent of
diabetes) and a chart-based study of British elders reported an
association between dipstick proteinuria and AMD in men but
not in women [14, 15]. Given that most chronic kidney dis-
eases initially manifest with small amounts of albumin in the
urine, we explored the relationship of albuminuria and glo-
merular filtration rate (GFR) with AMD in a generalizable
cohort of US adults.
Materials and methods
Study population
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III) is a national survey of non-institutionalized US residents using a
complex, multistage clustered sampling design to achieve generalizability
to the US population. NHANES III was conducted between 1988 and
1994. Fundus photography was limited to NHANES III participants aged
40 years and older (n ¼ 14 464). Of these, 8603 (59.5%) had bilateral
fundus photography at the time of the complete examination [16].
Demographic and clinical characteristics
Standardized questionnaires were administered in the home, followed by a
detailed physical examination and serum collection at an NHANES mobile
examination center. Participants self-selected the racial category that best
described them from non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican
American or other. Race for these analyses is dichotomized as black or
non-black. Participants were considered to have diabetes mellitus if they
reported ever having been told by a doctor that they had diabetes or `sugar
diabetes' other than during pregnancy or they reported taking insulin or a
`diabetes pill' at the time of the questionnaire. Participants were classified
as hypertensive if their mean (of up to six readings on two separate occa-
sions) blood pressure was !140 mmHg systolic, !90 mmHg diastolic or
were prescribed antihypertensive medications. History of cardiovascular
disease was defined by participant-identified history of stroke, myocardial
infarction or heart failure. C-reactive protein (CRP) in NHANES was not
measured using a high-sensitivity assay; accordingly, the lower level of
detection was 0.3 mg/L and values below this threshold are coded as
having a CRP level of 0.21 mg/dL.
Kidney data
Serum creatinine measurements were performed at a central laboratory
using a modified kinetic Jaffe assay on a Hitachi 737 analyzer (Boehringer
Mannheim Corp., Indianapolis, IN). In a sample of 1921 participants who
had a repeated creatinine measurement at a mean of 17 days apart, the
percentage of difference between the two measurements was 0.2 Æ 9.7%.
GFR was estimated with the CKD-epidemiology collaboration equation
using serum creatinine measurements recalibrated to the Cleveland Clinic
laboratory [17­19].
A random spot urine sample was obtained from each participant using a
clean-catch technique and sterile containers, and the sample was analyzed
on frozen non-hematuric specimens. Urine albumin concentration was
measured by solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay. Interassay coefficients
of variation for low (1.0 mg/L) and medium (15 mg/L) urine albumin
quality control standards were 16 and 10%, respectively. Urine creatinine
concentration was measured by means of the modified kinetic rate Jaffe
method using a Beckman Synchron AS/ASTRA analyzer (Beckman In-
struments Inc., Brea, CA). Microalbuminuria was defined by a urine al-
bumin-to-urine creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30­300 mg/g and
macroalbuminuria by ACR >300 mg/g.
Fundus evaluation
Procedures for fundus evaluation have been described previously [16].
Briefly, the retina of a non-pharmacologically dilated eye was photo-
graphed, with the field centered horizontally and vertically on a point
midway between the temporal edge of the optic disc and the fovea. Images
were evaluated at the University of Wisconsin by two experienced graders,
masked to subject information. The presence of any drusen, soft drusen,
retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) depigmentation, increased retinal pig-
ment, geographic atrophy and signs of exudative macular degeneration
were assessed. Early AMD was defined as the presence of either soft
drusen (!63 lm, consistent with Grade 3 drusen in the Wisconsin Age-
related Maculopathy Grading System [20]) or any drusen type with areas
of depigmentation or hypopigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium
without any visibility of choroidal vessels or with increased retinal pig-
ment in the macular area. Late AMD was defined as the presence of signs
of exudative macular degeneration or geographic atrophy (sharply de-
lineated roughly round or oval area of apparent absence of the RPE in
which choroidal vessels are more visible than in surrounding areas). Kappa
scores for intergrader and intragrader reliability ranged from 0.62 to 0.83
for AMD [16].
Statistical analysis
Albuminuria is highly prevalent in the general population and has multiple
common associates, including older age, diabetes and hypertension. Re-
flecting the competing causes of microalbuminuria whereby these medical
comorbid conditions are more likely to be associated with microalbumi-
nuria than AMD, we elected to use nested case­control methodology with
variable control optimal matching [21]. Prior to matching, individuals with
and without AMD were compared using analysis of variance and Wald
chi-square tests. To obtain a matched cohort for individuals with late
AMD, we performed variable control optimal matching with exact match-
ing on sex, race and age (within 1 year) to obtain five controls without
AMD for each case. To obtain a matched cohort for individuals with either
early or late AMD, we again performed variable control optimal matching
with exact matching on sex, race and age (within 2 years) in order to obtain
one control for each case. We performed univariate conditional logistic
regression on the matched case­control data to assess differences.

Multivariable analyses further adjusted for variables with P < 0.10
in univariate models. Candidate variables included those described in
Table 1. Due to the strong association with microalbuminuria and kidney
disease, diabetes was included in all multivariable models. Sensitivity
analyses were performed that excluded individuals with diabetes; these
analyses were otherwise identical to those described above with the ex-
ception that we obtained only four controls for each late AMD case. All
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (Cary, NC).
Results
Among 8603 NHANES III participants with fundus pho-
tography, 8208 were gradable as none, early or late AMD.
After excluding participants missing data on serum creati-
nine or urine albumin, there were 7667 participants: 6802
(88.7%) had no evidence of AMD, 814 (10.6%) were clas-
sified as early AMD and 51 (0.7%) as late AMD (Table 1).
Late AMD
As the youngest NHANES participant diagnosed with late
AMD was 59 years old, we limited the control population
to NHANES III participants aged 59 years or older, result-
ing in 3227 available controls. Table 2 presents the results
of 5:1 matching. Cases and controls were similar in base-
line characteristics, although individuals with late AMD
were more likely to have a history of hypertension (78.0
versus 60.0%, P ¼ 0.02) and lower estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) (62.8 Æ 17.8 versus 68.7 Æ 17.6 mL/
min/1.73m2, P ¼ 0.03). The ACR did not differ between
groups [median (interquartile range) 12.6 (5.7­35.4) ver-
sus 12.1 (6.8­27.6) mg/g, P ¼ 0.90]. In univariate condi-
tional logistic regression models, history of hypertension
[odds ratio (OR) ¼ 2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.11­4.51, P ¼ 0.02] and eGFR below 60 mL/min/
1.73m2 (OR ¼ 3.22, 95% CI: 1.63­6.40, P ¼ 0.001) were
associated with the presence of late AMD, while there
was no association of microalbuminuria (P ¼ 0.60) or
log-transformed ACR (P ¼ 0.93) with late AMD. There
was a borderline association between higher total choles-
terol level and late AMD [OR ¼ 1.31, 95% CI: 0.97­1.77,
P ¼ 0.08 for each SD (41.8 mg/dL) increase]. In multi-
variable analyses, the association between eGFR and
late AMD remained significant after adjusting for history
of diabetes, history of hypertension and cholesterol level

models and is not presented in Table 3.
Composite of early and late AMD
From 6802 individuals without AMD, 865 controls were
selected for the matched cohort (Table 4). Similar to late
AMD analyses, individuals with any AMD were more
likely to have hypertension than controls (59.8 versus
53.7%, P ¼ 0.01). Of controls, 16.0% had micro- or macro-
albuminuria, while 19.7% of cases had micro- or macro-
albuminuria (P ¼ 0.05). Median ACR did not significantly
differ between individuals with any AMD versus controls
[9.5 (4.9­23.4) versus 8.7 (5.0­18.3) mg/g, P ¼ 0.16].
There was no difference in eGFR or the proportion of
individuals with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m2 between
groups. In univariate conditional logistic regression
models, history of hypertension (OR ¼ 1.32, 95% CI:
1.08­1.62, P ¼ 0.007), presence of micro- or macroalbu-
minuria (OR ¼ 1.21, 95% CI: 0.93­1.58 and OR ¼ 2.10,
95% CI: 1.10­4.00, respectively, overall P ¼ 0.02) and
higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were
all associated with the presence of AMD (OR ¼ 1.14,
95% CI: 1.03­1.27 and OR ¼ 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03­1.25
per SD rise, respectively). Diabetes was associated with a
35% decrease in the likelihood of AMD (OR ¼ 0.65, 95%
CI: 0.49­0.86), while the relationship between eGFR
below 60 mL/min/1.73m2 and AMD was non-significant
(OR ¼ 1.18, 95% CI: 0.90­1.54). BMI of 30 kg/m2 or
higher was also associated with AMD (OR ¼ 1.36, 95%
CI: 1.05­1.75 versus a reference group of 18.5­24.9
kg/m2). Inflammatory markers were also associated with
the presence of AMD, with an 11% increased risk of
AMD with each doubling of CRP (OR ¼ 1.11, 95% CI:
1.02­1.21) and an 18% increase with each SD rise in
the white blood cell (WBC) count (OR ¼ 1.18, 95% CI:
1.05­1.34). In multivariable analyses, the association
between ACR and AMD was in the positive direction but
was not significant. Hypertension, obesity and higher WBC
count were associated with a higher prevalence of AMD
(Table 5). As WBC count and CRP were collinear and
WBC count was a more powerful predictor, and CRP
was not included in the multivariable model. There was
no significant association between eGFR and composite
AMD. Univariate and multivariable models examining
the 814 individuals with early AMD in a 1:1 match are
similar to those evaluating the composite of early and late
AMD discussed above.
Sensitivity analyses: individuals without diabetes
There were 45 individuals with late AMD matched with 180
controls without AMD. Baseline data only differed signifi-
cantly for eGFR (61.4 Æ 16.6 versus 67.8 Æ 16.2 mL/min/
1.73m2 for late AMD and non-AMD, respectively, P ¼ 0.02)
and the number of individuals with eGFR below 60 mL/min/
1.73m2 (55.6 versus 31.1%, respectively, P ¼ 0.002). In
models adjusting for hypertension and triglyceride level,
eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m2 was associated with a sim-
ilar increase in the likelihood of late AMD to that seen in
models including individuals with diabetes (OR ¼ 2.80, 95%
CI: 1.25­6.30, P ¼ 0.01). There was no association between
ACR and late AMD (data not shown).
There were 759 individuals without diabetes with either
early or late AMD; these individuals were matched with

Discussion
In this nested case­control study of participants in the
NHANES III population sample of non-institutionalized
US adults, we evaluated the association of albuminuria
(an early marker of kidney damage) and eGFR with
AMD. Major findings in the current study include (i) indi-
viduals with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 had a 2.5
times increased risk of late AMD compared to no AMD;
(ii) albuminuria was not significantly associated with late
AMD; (iii) albuminuria had a borderline association with
any AMD that was statistically significant in a sensitivity
analysis evaluating individuals without diabetes and
(iv) eGFR was not significantly associated with the pres-
ence of any AMD, although, in most analyses, hyperten-
sion was associated with AMD. Of note, analyses
evaluating late AMD were limited by the relatively small
number of NHANES III participants with this condition.
Why might kidney disease and AMD be associated with
each other? Firstly, CKD and AMD share cardiovascular
risk factors, most notably hypertension [22, 23]. Potentially
underlying this association is the hypothesis that athero-
sclerosis of the choroidal circulation may contribute to
the development of AMD [11, 24]. Secondly, albuminuria,
the most common indicator of kidney damage, is a power-
ful marker for systemic epithelial burden in the microvas-
culature of the kidney; critically, microvascular disease
involving smaller vessels in retinal circulation, specifically
the retinal pigment epithelium in the eye, may be an im-
portant contributor [11, 24­26]. Thirdly, recent data sug-
gest a potential shared genetic predisposition for dense
deposit diseases of the eyes and of the kidneys that are
related to key pathways for complement activation, with
variants in complement factor H, complement factor I and
complement three genes accounting for a significant pro-
portion of AMD risk [5, 27­30].
The latter relationship between kidney disease and AMD
is particularly interesting, given the relationship of poly-
morphisms both in the complement Factor H gene and
elsewhere in the complement pathway with kidney diseases
like thrombotic microangiopathy (specifically aHUS)
[3, 31] and dense deposit disease [6, 8]. Factor H has three
primary functions: (i) it is a cofactor for the serine protease,
Factor I, which cleaves C3b; (ii) it prevents amplification

of the alternative complement pathway by subsequent
cleavage of additional C3 to C3b by blocking the formation
of C3bBb and (iii) it competitively blocks binding of
C3b to host cell surfaces and tissue matrices [32]. Relative
deficiencies in complement Factor H can result in excessive
alternative pathway activation, particularly in times of
stress, and promote both thrombotic microangiopathy as
well as debris deposition.
Reflecting interest in the genetic links as well as cardio-
vascular links between kidney disease and AMD, several
cohort studies have explored the longitudinal relationship
between kidney function and AMD. A post hoc analysis of
the Australian Blue Mountains Eye Study cohort evaluated
1183 participants aged 54 years and older [13]. The 5-year
incidence of early AMD was 3.9% in participants with
creatinine clearance !60 mL/min/1.73m2 estimated
using the Cockroft Gault equation and 17.5% in those with
creatinine clearance <60 mL/min/1.73m2. In multivariable
models that included a term for complement factor H
Y402H genotype (homozygous, heterozygous and noncar-
rier), persons with reduced kidney function were three
times more likely to develop early AMD than those with
intact kidney function (OR 3.2, 95% CI, 1.8­5.7, P <
0.0001). Notably, no relationship was seen in the subgroup
of individuals aged <65 years old. The other study exam-
ined the Beaver Dam cohort in Wisconsin, USA, and noted
that mild elevations in serum cystatin C as well as
eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 were associated with incident
early AMD but were not associated with incident pure
geographic atrophy or progression of AMD [12]. Higher
cystatin C was also associated with incident exudative
AMD in multivariable analyses in the Beaver Dam Study,
although these analyses were limited by the relatively low
number of cases (~60).
Our study further explores the cross-sectional relation-
ship between kidney markers and AMD. Interestingly, we
did note a relationship between low eGFR and late AMD
but no significant relationship with albuminuria. There are
several possible explanations for our negative findings for
the effect of albuminuria: (i) using a nested case­control
design, we were able to effectively match for age, sex and
race, perhaps eliminating much of the confounds intro-
duced by these demographic factors; (ii) there is a survival
bias such that individuals with systemic vascular disease as
indicated by albuminuria do not survive to develop AMD;
(iii) the finding that diabetes is associated with a lower
likelihood of AMD may obscure this relationship, although
it is also possible that this represents ascertainment bias as
individuals with diabetic retinopathy are less likely to have
gradable fundus photography [16] and (iv) albuminuria and
AMD are truly not associated. To more fully explore
several of these possibilities, we performed sensitivity anal-
yses excluding individuals with diabetes; results remained
similar in these analyses, although the association between
albuminuria and the composite of early and late AMD
achieved statistical significance, supporting our hypothesis
that an ascertainment bias may be introduced with inclu-
sion of individuals with diabetes in the primary analyses.
The current study has several strengths. Most notable is
the use of a large broadly generalizable population. Addi-
tionally, by using a nested case­control design, we are able
to minimize the influence of confounding factors. There are
also some weaknesses, most notably the cross-sectional
design and the lack of information on specific genes that
may impact both kidney function and AMD. Additionally,
there are a limited number of individuals with late AMD
resulting in difficulty disproving the null hypothesis for
several analyses; however, we used a nested case­control
design to maximize our ability to explore the association
between late AMD and kidney disease in this generalizable
cohort.
Conclusions
Our study revealed modest associations between reduced
GFR and late AMD as well as a modest association between
albuminuria and early or late AMD in individuals without
diabetes. Although these results do not strongly support use
of kidney markers as tools to identify a high-risk population
for prevalent AMD, they do shed light on what is likely a
multifactorial disease process with multiple factors affecting
disease expression and organ manifestations.
