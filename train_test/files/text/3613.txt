Abstract
Objective: In adults, improper arterial function has been linked to cognitive impairment.
The pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx) and other vascular parameters are
useful indicators of arterial health. In our study, we monitored arterial properties, body
constitution, school success, and motor skills in young adolescents. We hypothesize that reduced
cognitive and motor abilities have a vascular origin in children.
Methods: We analysed 81 healthy school children aged 11­16 years. Anthropometry central
systolic arterial pressure, body mass index (BMI), standard deviation scores (SDS) BMI, general
school performance grade, and eight motor tests were assessed. PWV, AIx, and central systolic
arterial pressure (SBPao) were measured.
Results: AIx and SBPao correlated negatively with school performance grades. Extremely high AIx,
PWVand SBPao values were observed in 5% of children and these children had average to low school
performance. PWV correlated significantly with weight, height, and waist and hip circumference. AIx,
PWV, school success, and BMI correlated strongly with certain motor functions.
Conclusions: Increased AIx and SBPao are associated with lower school and motor performance
in children. PWV is influenced by the body's constitution.

Introduction
Childhood obesity is a serious health issue in
the developed world. Obesity affects almost
all areas of a child's life. Obese children are
less successful in sport and social activ-
ities.1,2 However, a significant association
between obesity and lower academic school
performance has not been reported yet.3
A clear association between increased arter-
ial stiffness and cognitive decline was found
in adults individuals.4­6 Executive cognitive
functions were more disturbed than memory
functions.7 A possible pathophysiological
mechanism for this cognitive decline may
be impaired hemodynamic and microvascu-
lar function of the brain caused by athero-
sclerosis.8 An excessive accumulation of fat
in visceral and other organs severely disturbs
the metabolism, leading to metabolic syn-
drome and atherosclerosis.9,10 However, ath-
erosclerosis can also be found in children and
adults with a normal body constitution.11,12
Even minimal intima atherosclerotic damage
changes the properties of arterial walls.
Increased arterial stiffness can be measured
by pulse wave velocity (PWV), but the aug-
mentation index (AIx) and SBPao have
also been recognised as indicators of arterial
health.13­14 The aim of our study was to
find children with subclinical changes in
arterial function, like atherosclerosis, among
the healthy school population. We tested
whether underlying changes in arterial prop-
erties result in lower school and motor per-
formance in children.
Materials and methods
Eighty-one healthy children aged 11­16
years who attended periodic health checks
were recruited for our study. Approval was
received from the ethical committee and
written consent was obtained from the par-
ents. We acquired information about family
history and socioeconomic status from a
short questionnaire presented to the partici-
pants and their parents. History of obesity,
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, fatal
cardiovascular disease (CVD) or stroke and
malignancy in the first and second line of
the family were recorded. The level of par-
ent education and the employment sta-
tus (employed, unemployed, farmer) was
also noted. In addition, the number of
daily meals and the number of sweet or
salty snacks and fast food meals per week
were documented. We measured the height,
weight, waist and hip circumference (waist,
hip) of participants in the morning, while
they were in a fasting state and wearing light
underwear. Height was measured using a
stadiometer (SECA) to the nearest 1 cm.
Body mass was recorded to the nearest
0.1 kg using a calibrated balance (SECA).
The waist was measured at the narrowest
point between the lower costal border and
the iliac crest, to the nearest 1 cm. The hip
was measured at the trochanteric region
with a classic tape. Body mass index (BMI)
and standard deviation scores (SDS) BMI
were calculated according to the
Manchester SDS BMI calculator. Puberty
was checked according to the Tanner
pubertal score. The time of menarche was
recorded in girls. The general school per-
formance grade was provided by the scho-
lars, and the parents or guardians. The
general school performance grade is an
average of all subject grades obtained in
one school year on a scale of 1­5, in which
5 is excellent and 1 is insufficient.

Arterial function assessment
Arterial function was assessed using the
Arteriograph (Tensiomed, Budapest,
Hungary), which is an easy-to-use, non-inva-
sive occlusive oscillometric device for simul-
taneous measurement of arterial pressure
(AP), AIx, PWV, mean arterial pressure,
central systolic arterial pressure (SBPao), and
other parameters such as ejection duration. A
high fidelity pressure sensor within an upper-
arm cuff records very small pressure changes
during each cardiac cycle. At the beginning of
systole, the blood ejected to the arterial system
generatesan early(direct) systolic wave(P1
). A
late systolic pressure wave (P2
) is likely a result
of rebounded pressure waves. In the case of
normal arterial compliance, the direct P1
is
higher than the reflected P2
. If the arterial wall
is stiff, e.g., because of atherosclerosis, a large
part of the pressure wave is reflected from the
aorta bifurcation and peripheral arteries,
resulting in a high amplitude P2
. All data
received by the Arteriograph are wirelessly
transmitted to a personal computer and
analysed using the device's proprietary soft-
ware. The AIx was calculated from the amp-
litude of P1
and P2
and pulse pressure (PP)
using the following formula: AIx ¼ (P2
­P1
)/
PPx100%
AIx depends on the peripheral resistance
and PWV and gives complex information
about arterial wall properties. The PWV pro-
vides information about increased arterial
stiffness and is less influenced by the peripheral
resistance. PWV is automatically calculated
from the return time,the time intervalbetween
the systolic waves (P1
) and (P2
), and the
distance between the throat Jugulum-symphy-
sis(termin used to describe an even more
precise location and is also accepted with
specialised literature). and the symphysis.15,16
Calculation of the PWV from the throat
jugulum­symphysis distance is not recom-
mended, and the gold standard approach is
to measure the carotid­femoral distance.17
The aim of our study was to identify children
with altered arterial function from a healthy
population, which seems to be more effective
when having reference values of investigated
parameters. We used the Arteriograph because
reference values for PWV, AIx and SBPao
were available for our participant age group.18
Motor skills measurement
SLOFIT is the national program for measur-
ing the body fitness of school children in
Slovenia. Every year in April all primary and
secondary school children in Slovenia are
tested by qualified sports teachers according
to the official measurement protocol.
The SLOFIT programme includes eight
motor tests and three anthropometric meas-
urements. We only used the motor test meas-
urements: arm-plate tapping (APT), which
tested the speed of alternate movement,
standing long jump (SLJ), which tested explo-
sive strength power, polygon backwards (PB),
which tested the coordination of whole body
movements, sit-ups (SU), which tested mus-
cular endurance of the torso, standing reach
touch (SRT), which tested flexibility, bent
arm hang (BAH), which tested muscular
endurance of the shoulder girdle and arms,
60-meter run (RUN 60), which tested sprint
speed and 600-meter run (RUN 600), which
tested general endurance.19
Statistical analysis
The data were analysed with SPSS Statistics
22.0 software (IBM Inc., Armonk, New
York) using the non-parametric Mann-
Whitney U-Test and the non-parametric
Spearman correlation after Shapiro-Wilk
test of normality. A p value of 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of the total study population
are listed in Table 1. Eighty-one children
were tested, including 34 girls and 47 boys.
1894 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
There were no significant differences in age,
body weight (weight), waist circumference
(waist), diastolic arterial pressure (AP diast),
BMI, SDS BMI, AIx, PWV, and SBPao
between the sexes. Boys were taller than girls
(p < 0.01) and had a higher systolic arterial
pressure (AP syst) (p < 0.05). There were no
differences in school success and APT
between girls and boys, but boys showed
significantly better results in all other motor
tests. All girls had already reached puberty
and 30 (88.2%) had experienced menarche.
On the Tanner scale for sexual maturity,
31 (91.3%) females reached grade 4 or 5
for breast development and 32 (94.2%)
for pubic hair development. Three males
(6.4 %) had a Tanner scale of grade 1
(pre-pubertal), 16 (34.0%) were grade 2, 9
(19.2%) were grade 3, and 19 (40.4%) were
grade 4.
No significant correlation was found
between family burden and CVD, PWV,
AIx, SBPao, or between school success and
motor tests. Parent education level had a
significant positive influence on their child's
school success. The employment status of
the parents did not influence their children's
school success, but the children were signifi-
cantly less successful at school if their father
was a farmer. Eating habits, including the
consumption of sweet or salty snacks and
fast food did not correlate with PWV, AIx,
SBPao, or any other parameters investigated.
We found a statistically negative correlation
of AIx with body height (p < 0.05). PWV
correlated positively with body weight

and hip measurements (p < 0.01). There was
no correlation between body weight, BMI,
SDS BMI, or waist circumference and school
success.
Regarding arterial properties in connec-
tion with cognitive function, AIx (p < 0.05)
and SBPao (p < 0.05) were negatively asso-
ciated with school success. AIx was signifi-
cantly associated with school success in boys
(p < 0.05), but not in girls. In girls, SBPao
associated significantly with school success
(p < 0.05), while PWV did not affect school
success. Results are listed in Table 2.
Motor performance was related to AIx,
PWV, and school success. School success
correlated significantly with APT (p < 0.05)
and the SRT (p < 0.01). A negative
correlation was found between school suc-
cess and the time taken to complete the PB
(p < 0.01). PWV correlated negatively with
the length of SLJ (p < 0.05) and correlated
positively with the 600 m run (p < 0.05). AIx
correlated negatively with APT (p < 0.01). A
strong correlation was found between BMI
and all motor tests, except APT and the
SRT. Results are presented in Table 3.
Discussion
The most important discovery of our study
was the negative correlation between AIx
and SBPao and school performance grades.
Less successful children have higher AIx and
SBPao than children with excellent grades.

subject of intensive research in adults.4­7,20
The aetiology of vascular cognitive impair-
ment is multifactorial. Structural pathology
and hemodynamic abnormalities, like cere-
bral hypoperfusion and impaired cerebral
vasomotor reactivity, are the main causes of
cognitive decline in patients with athero-
sclerosis or other vascular diseases.8
Childhood obesity and metabolic syn-
drome are epidemic in modern society.
There is a serious threat that the current
generation of children will die before their
parents.21 Increased arterial wall thickness22
and increased PWV23 have been reported in
obese children, but increased arterial stiffness
and cognitive function has not been reported
in healthy young populations. Our results
show that altered arterial properties affect
academic achievement in children. In addition
to the effects of AIx and SBPao on school
success, we found high PWV, AIx, and
SBPao values in 5% of our study population.
This group of children had average to low
academic attainment. Based on our findings,
we conclude that the vascular origin of cog-
nitive deficits can be diagnosed early in
childhood. This may represent an important
contribution to the improvement of health
and educational care in children. The early
prethrombotic stages of atherosclerosis can
be completely reversed.10 Early diagnosis
followed by effective prevention and treat-
ment may improve cognitive function and
prevent fatal CVD later in life. In adults with
carotid atherosclerosis, cognitive execution
but not memory function was impaired.7
Unfortunately, we did not obtain the grades
from specific subjects and did not test specific
cognitive functions, therefore we cannot com-
ment whether this is true in children.
Nonetheless, the correlations of school suc-
cess, AIx, and PWV with SLOFIT motor
tests in the present study were very interesting.
Children with higher school grades tend to
have a more flexible body and better coord-
ination of the hands and entire body.
Children with high AIx were not as successful
at school and had slower alternating move-
ment of the hands. In addition, children with
high PWV values had lower explosive
strength and general endurance. Based on
our results, we conclude that subclinical
vascular changes can affect some motor
functions in children. Arm-plate tapping
may be a useful test in screening for early
vascular abnormalities leading to cognitive
impairment, especially because it is not
influenced by obesity.19
Even though there is strong evidence that
obesity and metabolic syndrome lead to struc-
tural brain damage,24 most epidemiologic
studies have not found a direct connection
between obesity and school performance.3
School performance was not correlated
to BMI or other body measures in our
study. Although obesity increases the risk of
atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome,
10%­20% of extremely obese people never
progress to CVD, while people with normal
or even low body weight can die of stroke or
other fatal CVD.10,11
Measurement of arterial function is a
much more effective than anthropometry at
uncovering early atherosclerotic changes
and their consequences, such as cognitive
deficits.13,14 Women have a higher risk for
CVD than men.25 Increased arterial stiffness
was found in pre-pubertal girls and post-
menopausal women compared with men of
the same age.26,27 There are some signs of sex-
based differences in academic performance
and CVD or stroke risk, with a stronger
association in females.28,29 In our study, no
gender differences were observed in general
school performance, but the strong associ-
ation between AIx and school success was
only found in boys. On the other hand, SBPao
was only related to school success in girls.
Detailed analyses showed that all the females
had already reached puberty. Female sex
hormones have a strong influence on vascular
compliance, which is significantly higher in
post-pubertal than pre-pubertal girls.26 This
means that discovering of altered arterial
Vogrin et al. 1897
properties are more effective in pre-pubertal
or post-menopausal women. SBPao appears
to be a more sensitive parameter than AIx for
identifying arterial pathologies in women who
have already reached menarche.
PWV was not correlated to school suc-
cess; smoothed percentile curves showed a
slight increase (about 1 m/s) between 3­18
years of age.18 In our study, PWV correlated
significantly with body height, weight, waist,
and hip measurements. The interpretation
of PWV as a sign of vascular pathology
in children is probably more complex.
The body's constitution appears to affect
PWV values. However, the extremely high
AIx, PWV, and SBPao values we found in
5% of our study population indicates a
vascular pathology that should be investi-
gated further.
Conclusions
Our study has shown that altered arterial
properties may cause cognitive and motor
impairment in young adolescents and that
PWV is influenced by body constitution.
Strengths and limitations
The present study investigated general
school performance and no other specific
cognitive measures. Insight into grades for
different subjects would give us a better
insight into specific cognitive deficits.
For the interpretation of increased arterial
stiffness, the pre-pubertal period in girls
would be a better choice. Unfortunately,
school success is evaluated with grades from
the age of 8­10 years in Slovenia. In healthy
girls, puberty normally starts at around 8­12
years of age,30 therefore it was impossible to
check school success in pre-pubertal scholars.
The PWV in our study did not correlate
with school success, although values far
above the published average were found in
5% of children with average to low school
performance. PWV measured with the
Arteriograph measures stiffness of the bra-
chial artery and not the aorta.31 Calculating
the PWV from the carotid­femoral distance
may have given different results.
