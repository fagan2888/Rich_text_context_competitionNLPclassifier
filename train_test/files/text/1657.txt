Background--Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated guidance on lipid screening in childhood. Our
objective was to examine recent distributions in concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol among US children and adolescents and to estimate the prevalence of adolescents who are potentially eligible
for pharmacological treatment for elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Methods and Results--We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2006 for
participants 6 to 17 years of age. The mean concentration for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for participants 12 to
17 years of age was 90.2 mg/dL (n2724), and the mean concentration of total cholesterol among participants 6 to 17
years of age was 163.0 mg/dL (n9868). Depending on the cut points used, an elevated concentration of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol was noted for 5.2% to 6.6% of participants and an elevated concentration of total cholesterol for
9.6% to 10.7%. Approximately 0.8% of adolescents 12 to 17 years of age were potentially eligible for pharmacological
treatment for elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Conclusion--Given current guidelines, only a small percentage of US adolescents may need pharmacological treatment for
elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. (Circulation. 2009;119:1108-1115.)

The roots of coronary heart disease herald back to child-
hood. Autopsy studies have demonstrated the presence of
early lesions of coronary heart disease in the heart vessels of
children and adolescents.1 Furthermore, the presence of these
changes correlated with known risk factors for cardiovascular
disease, including concentrations of low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol and total cholesterol.2,3 In addition, concentrations
of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol predict subclinical
atherosclerosis as determined by carotid intima-media thick-
ness in adults.4,5 In recognition of the role of dyslipidemia in
the early genesis of coronary heart disease, the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently released a report on
lipid screening in childhood.6

In that report, thresholds for defining hypercholesterolemia
and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were sum-
marized. One set of values were derived from a report from
the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in 1992.
Another set of values were derived from data from the Lipid
Research Clinics Prevalence Study. Previous publications
have provided important information about lipid concentra-
tions in children and adolescents.7­14 However, much of that
information is 10 years old. Therefore, our objective was to
provide updated information about concentrations of low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol in chil-
dren and adolescents in the United States.
Methods
We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2006. During each consecutive 2-year
cycle from 1999 through 2006, a national sample was recruited using
a multistage, stratified sampling design. The surveys were designed
to produce results representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US
population. Participants were interviewed at home and were invited to
attend a mobile examination center, where they were asked to complete
additional questionnaires, undergo various examinations, and provide a
blood sample. The surveys received human subject approval. Parental
permission to allow a child to participate in the survey was obtained, as
well as assent from children and adolescents 7 to 17 years of age.
Participants 18 years of age were asked to sign an informed consent
form. Details about the survey may be found elsewhere.15
Measurements of concentrations of total serum cholesterol were
conducted for participants 3 years of age for NHANES 1999 to
2004 and for participants 6 years of age for NHANES 2005 to
2006. For analyses involving concentrations of total cholesterol, we
included all participants who had a measurement regardless of
fasting status. Measurements of fasting serum concentrations of

low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were calculated with the Friede-
wald equation for participants 12 years of age who attended the
morning examination if their concentrations of triglycerides were
400 mg/dL.
Detailed descriptions about blood collection and processing are
provided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Proce-
dures Manual. Specimens were stored at 20°C and shipped weekly
to the Lipoprotein Analytical Laboratory at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity Hospital. This laboratory participates in the Lipid Standardiza-
tion Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
From 1999 through 2005, serum cholesterol was measured enzymat-
ically on a Hitachi 717 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
Ind) with commercial reagents. In 2006, serum cholesterol was
measured enzymatically on a Hitachi 912 Analyzer. We used the 2
approaches presented in the AAP guidelines to define elevated
concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cho-
lesterol: (1) cut points from guidelines of the NCEP in 199216 and (2)
cut points derived from data from the Lipid Research Clinics
Pediatric Prevalence Study.6 The cut points based on the NECP
guidelines are 200 mg/dL for total cholesterol and 130 mg/dL for
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The cut points for abnormal
concentrations of total cholesterol based on the 95th percentile in the
Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study are 201 mg/dL for boys 10
to 14 years of age, 191 mg/dL for boys 15 to 19 years of age, 205
mg/dL for girls 10 to 14 years of age, and 208 mg/dL for girls 15 to
19 years of age. The cut points for low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol are 133, 130, 136, and 137 mg/dL for the 4 groups, respectively.
During 1999 to 2002, concentrations of high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol were measured by both the heparin-manganese precipi-
tation method and the direct immunoassay method. A change in the
method for measuring concentrations of high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol took place in 2003 when, from then on, concentrations of
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured only with the
direct immunoassay method.17 Concurrent with this change in
methods, measurements of concentrations of high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol were higher for the period of 2003 to 2006 than for
the period of 1999 to 2002. Because concentrations of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol were calculated, the upward bias in concen-
trations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol may have resulted in
a slight lowering of the calculated values for low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol for the period of 2003 to 2006 compared with the period
of 1999 to 2002.
Using the approach presented in the AAP report, we estimated
the percentage of adolescents 12 to 17 years of age whose
elevated concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
potentially qualified them for pharmacological treatment.6 The
AAP uses 3 thresholds for elevated concentrations of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol to determine the need for pharmacological
management of the dyslipidemia. If a patient does not have a risk
factor (obesity, hypertension, cigarette smoking, family history of
premature cardiovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus), pharma-
cological management can be considered when concentrations of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol exceed 190 mg/dL. In the
presence of risk factors (obesity, hypertension, cigarette smoking,
or family history of premature cardiovascular disease), pharma-
cological management can be considered when concentrations of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol exceed 160 mg/dL. In the
presence of diabetes mellitus, pharmacological management can
be considered when concentrations of low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol equal or exceed 130 mg/dL.
Obesity was defined as a body mass index 95th percentile
determined from the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion Growth Charts.18 The recommendations of the Fourth Report on
the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in
Children and Adolescents were used to define hypertension.19
Concentrations of cotinine were used to establish smoking status. A
concentration 10 ng/mL was considered smoking.20 Participants
who had a fasting plasma concentration of glucose 126 mg/dL or
reported using insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents were classified as
having diabetes. Demographic covariates included in the analyses
were age, sex, race, or ethnicity (white, black, Mexican American,
other).
The main analyses include data from NHANES 1999 to 2006.
Generally, analyses involving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were
limited to participants 12 to 17 years of age and analyses involving total
cholesterol to those 6 to 17 years of age. In addition, we analyzed data
for NHANES 1999 to 2004 to provide estimates of mean concentrations
of total cholesterol for participants as young as 3 years of age and as old
as 19 years of age and to make comparisons with previously published
information concerning concentrations of total cholesterol and low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol from NHANES III (1988 to 1994). We
calculated means and percentages with elevated concentrations of lipids.
For race- or ethnic-specific estimates, we present results for only the 3
major groups (whites, blacks, Mexican Americans). Differences in
proportions and means were tested with 2 tests and t tests, respectively.
Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the
statistical significance of the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity on
concentrations of lipids. Log-binomial regression analysis was used to
examine the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity on the prevalence of
elevated concentrations of lipids. In regression models, age was treated
a continuous variable for analyses involving participants 12 to 17 years
of age and was dichotomized for analyses involving participants 6 to 17
years of age (6 to 11 and 12 to 17 years of age). Software for the
Statistical Analysis of Correlated Data (SUDAAN) was used for the
analyses to account for the complex sampling design.

Results
Of the 7180 participants 12 to 17 years of age who participated
in NHANES 1999 to 2006, 2778 were part of the fasting
subsample. Values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were
available for 2724 of them. Participants with a value for
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 0.7 years younger
(P0.048). However, no significant differences in the percent-
age of participants who were male or white were present. Of the
11714 participants 6 to 17 years of age who attended the mobile
examination center, 9868 had a value for total cholesterol.
Participants with a value for total cholesterol were 1.3 years
older (P0.001). However, no significant differences in the
percentage of participants who were male or white were present.
The mean concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholester-
ol among adolescents 12 to 17 years of age was 90.2 mg/dL
(Table 1). The results of a multiple linear regression model that
included age, gender, ethnicity, and survey cycle showed that
none of the demographic variables were significant predictors of
concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
The mean concentration of total cholesterol among children
and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age was 163.0 mg/dL. Results
from the multiple linear regression analysis indicated that con-
centrations of total cholesterol were 6.2 mg/dL lower among
participants 12 to 17 years of age than among those 6 to 11 years
of age (P0.001) and 3.6 mg/dL higher among girls than boys
(P0.001). Furthermore, concentrations of total cholesterol
were 2.6 mg/dL higher among blacks than whites (P0.006)
and 1.9 mg/dL lower among Mexican Americans than whites
(P0.022). Mean concentrations of total cholesterol plotted by
individual year of age for boys and girls participating in
NHANES 1999 to 2004 suggest that the higher concentrations
among girls start to emerge around 14 years of age (Figure).

tein cholesterol by demographic variables are shown in Table

with a body mass index 85th percentile, the median
concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 3
mg/dL lower than the median for all participants.
When Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study cut
points were used, 5.2% of adolescents 12 to 17 years of age
had an elevated concentration of low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and 10.7% of participants 6 to 17 years of age

had hypercholesterolemia (Table 4). The results of the
log-binomial analysis that included age, gender, ethnicity,
and survey cycle showed no significant effects of the
demographic variables on elevated concentrations of low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Compared with participants 6 to 11 years of age, partici-
pants 12 to 17 years of age had a lower prevalence of
hypercholesterolemia (P0.001). The prevalence of hyper-
cholesterolemia was higher among boys than girls (P0.009)
and higher among blacks than whites (P0.026).
The use of the NCEP cut points resulted in a somewhat
higher prevalence of elevated concentrations of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol but a slightly lower prevalence of
hypercholesterolemia (Table 5). Whereas the analyses based
on the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study cut points
resulted in a higher prevalence of elevated concentrations of
total cholesterol for boys than girls, the analyses based on the
NCEP cut points yielded the opposite pattern. No statistically
significant age, gender, or ethnic differences in the preva-
lence of elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol were found.
With respect to hypercholesterolemia, participants 12 to 17
years of age had a lower prevalence (P0.024) than those 6

to 11 years of age. Blacks had a higher prevalence than whites
(P0.016). No statistically significant differences were noted
between boys and girls.
Using the recommendations for pharmacological treatment
of elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol issued by the AAP, we found that 0.8% of adolescents
12 to 17 years of age were eligible for treatment. Because of
the small magnitude of these percentages, detailed analyses
for possible determinants were not feasible. Of the 26
adolescents who qualified for pharmacological treatment, 11
had a concentration 190 mg/dL (4 also had at least 1 risk
factor, and 1 participant had a risk factor and diabetes), and
15 had at least 1 risk factor and a concentration 160 mg/dL.
Only 1 participant 16 years of age reported using a choles-
terol-lowering medication, in this case cholestyramine.
Discussion
The recent lipid screening recommendations issued by the
AAP have drawn new attention to the importance of healthy
lipid concentrations in children and adolescents. Our analysis
of recent national data from the United States indicates that,
depending on the cut points used, 5.2% to 6.6% of adoles-
cents 12 to 17 years of age had elevated concentrations of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, 0.8% of
such adolescents would qualify for lipid-lowering treatment
based on the AAP guidelines.
Although the difference in age groups limits the possible
comparisons, the 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles for
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the Lipid Research
Clinic Pediatric Prevalence Study for adolescents 15 to 19 years
of age were 93, 109, 123, and 130 mg/dL, respectively, for boys
and 93, 110, 129, and 137 mg/dL, respectively, for girls. In
comparison, the percentiles calculated with NHANES 1999 to
2006 data for boys 15 to 19 years of age were 88, 106, 124, and
138 mg/dL, respectively, and those for girls 15 to 19 years of age
were 92, 109, 127, and 137 mg/dL, respectively. Thus, the
percentiles for girls are in close agreement between the 2 sets of

data, whereas those for boys differ somewhat. Limiting the
analysis to those who were not overweight or obese reduced the
NHANES medians by a few milligrams per deciliter. NHANES
data have demonstrated clear decreases in concentrations of total
cholesterol among adolescents 12 to 17 years of age in the
United States from 1966 to 1970 to 1988 to 1994.13 During this
same period, marked increases in childhood obesity occurred in
the United States. An unfavorable effect of obesity on concen-
trations of lipids in children has been demonstrated.21 Beside the
possible effects of temporal trends, differences in characteristics
of the study populations and laboratory methods further compli-
cate comparisons between the 2 sets of data.
Several major studies, including the Muscatine Study, Lipid
Research Clinics Prevalence Study, Bogalusa Heart Study, and
NHANES, have provided important information about concen-
trations of lipids in children and adolescents in the United
States.7­14 These studies have yielded important information
about age, gender, and ethnic differences in concentrations of
lipids. In addition, critical insights into the tracking of concen-
trations of lipids have been gleaned from these studies.22­24 Data
from NHANES III (1988 to 1994) provided some of the most
detailed information about concentrations of lipids in children
and adolescents in the United States.13 The authors provided
means and various percentiles of lipid distributions but did not
provide estimates of the prevalence of elevated concentrations of
lipids. The 90th percentile for participants 4 to 19 years of age in
that survey was 200 mg/dL, which is the same as in NHANES
1999 to 2004. Consistent with the findings from NHANES III,
we also observed that concentrations of total cholesterol peaked
around 8 to 10 years of age. No age-related differences in
concentrations of total cholesterol were reported from the Mus-
catine Study.7 In NHANES III, concentrations of total choles-
terol were higher in female than male participants.13 In addition,

gender differences have been noted in other studies such as the
Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study and the Child and
Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health11­13,25 but not in
other studies.7,9
Our results showing that concentrations of total cholesterol
were higher among black children and adolescents than white
children and adolescents are consistent with the results from
previous studies.8,13,25 In NHANES III, concentrations of total
cholesterol were 6 mg/dL higher among black children and
adolescents 4 to 19 years of age than white children and
adolescents.13 Part of the higher concentrations of total choles-
terol among blacks is attributable to the higher unadjusted mean
concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol among
blacks (56.1 mg/dL) than among whites (50.9 mg/dL) in
NHANES 1999 to 2006.
Compared with results from NHANES III, concentrations of
total cholesterol among children and adolescents 4 to 19 years of
age were 1 mg/dL lower in NHANES 1999 to 2004 (NHANES
III, 165 mg/dL [SE, 0.6 mg/dL]13; NHANES 1999 to 2004, 164
mg/dL [SE, 0.6 mg/dL]). For those 12 to 17 years of age, mean
concentrations of total cholesterol were 160 mg/dL (SE, 1.1
mg/dL) in NHANES III and 161 mg/dL (SE, 0.7 mg/dL) in
NHANES 1999 to 2004. Assuming that laboratory methods for
determining concentrations of total cholesterol were reasonably
consistent for the surveys,26 it appears that little change in mean
concentrations of total cholesterol took place over a period of
10 to 11 years. This stands in contrast to the 7-mg/dL decline
that occurred among adolescents 12 to 17 years of age from
1966 to 1970 to 1988 to 1994.
For participants 12 to 19 years of age, mean concentrations of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 95 mg/dL (SE, 1.6
mg/dL) in NHANES III13 and 94 mg/dL (SE, 0.8 mg/dL) in
NHANES 1999 to 2004. For boys 12 to 19 years of age, mean
concentrations were 91 mg/dL (SE, 2.1 mg/dL) in NHANES III
and 94 mg/dL (SE, 1.3 mg/dL) in NHANES 1999 to 2004. For
girls 12 to 19 years of age, mean concentrations were 99 mg/dL
(SE, 2.4 mg/dL) in NHANES III and 93 mg/dL (SE, 1.0 mg/dL)
in NHANES 1999 to 2004. Thus, little change in mean concen-
trations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol occurred during
the period covered by 2 surveys, although the data suggest that
concentrations increased in boys and decreased in girls.
Because information about a family history of cardiovas-
cular disease was not collected for participants 20 years of
age, we were unable to estimate precisely the prevalence of
children and adolescents who were potentially eligible for
pharmacological treatment. Although our estimate of 0.8%
is an underestimate as a result, it is not likely to be
substantially higher. In addition, larger sample sizes would
have allowed more detailed analyses of lipid concentrations
by combinations of demographic variables.
About 5.2% to 6.6% of adolescents 12 to 17 years of age had
elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
and 9.6% to 10.7% of children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of
age had elevated concentrations of total cholesterol. An esti-
mated 0.8% of children and adolescents 12 to 17 years of age
qualified for pharmacological treatment to lower concentrations
of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. According to population
projections for the US population in 2008, 25 million people
were 12 to 17 years of age. Thus, a percentage of 0.8% of
adolescents who might be eligible for pharmacological treatment
would represent 200 000 adolescents 12 to 17 years of age.
NHANES data from 1999 to 2006 provide an updated picture of
the state of affairs regarding concentrations of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol in children and
adolescents in the United States and the size of the potential pool
of children and adolescents who may be eligible for pharmaco-
logical treatment for elevated concentrations of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) updated guidance on lipid screening in childhood. These guidelines
elicited considerable discussion about the use of pharmacotherapy to manage elevations of concentrations of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol in children and adolescents. Given the increases in obesity that have occurred among US children
and adolescents during the last several decades and the link between excess weight and concentrations of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, an estimate of the potential percentage of children and adolescents who might be eligible for
pharmacotherapy to manage elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was needed to help inform the
debate about the impact of the AAP guidelines. Using national data, we estimate that, depending on the threshold used,
5.2% to 6.6% of adolescents 12 to 17 years of age had elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
0.8% of adolescents 12 to 17 years of age were potentially eligible for pharmacological treatment on the basis of the AAP
report. Thus, clinicians whose patients are reasonably representative of the community can anticipate that, on average,
1% or fewer of their patients may be eligible for pharmacotherapy for elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol. However, clinicians whose practices include large numbers of children with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension
are likely to encounter more such patients.
