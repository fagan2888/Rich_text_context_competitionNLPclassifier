Abstract: US state alcohol consumption patterns and trends are examined in order to
identify groups of states with similar drinking habits or cultures. Rates of heavy drinking
and current abstention and per capita apparent consumption levels are used to categorize
states. Six state groupings were identified: North Central and New England with the highest
consumption and heavy drinking levels; Middle Atlantic, Pacific and South Coast with
moderate drinking levels; and Dry South with the lowest drinking levels. Analyses of
relationships between beer and spirits series for states within groups as compared to those in
different groups failed to clearly indicate group cohesiveness.

1. Background
Each state of the United States has unique characteristics relevant to the determination of a drinking
culture and corresponding alcohol consumption patterns and alcohol-related problems. Factors that
may underlie or influence drinking culture include a state's demographic make-up in terms of age,
gender and race/ethnicity groups, the distribution of socio-economic characteristics such as
educational attainment, income and wealth, a state's mix of religions with differing perspectives on
alcohol use, degree of urbanicity, state alcohol policies and regulatory regimes, the structure of the
alcoholic beverage market in terms of wholesale and retail distribution networks, historical and
cultural practices related to drinking (or not drinking) various alcoholic beverages, the size and

importance of alcoholic beverage production industries both historically and currently, exposure to
advertising for alcohol products and potentially other factors. Yet, clearly some of these aspects of
drinking culture are shared across states, particularly those in geographic proximity to one another, and
other aspects may be shared across states with similar populations throughout the country. Therefore,
one would expect that drinking cultures and markets would not be defined by state borders in most
cases. Media markets too may help create cultural sub-groups that cover multiple states or even
market-related areas potentially spread across many parts of the country. Relative proportions of the
various demographic and market-demarcated sub-groups, along with geographic proximity, should
define the degree of shared drinking cultures between states. Thus, states may share similarities in
terms of certain beverage types or drinking patterns but may be divergent on other beverages or trends.
It is also relevant regarding drinking culture, to consider commonalities reflected in trends over time.
Past research has generally focused on characterizing Wet and Dry regions of the US. In these
studies and the current analysis "wetness" is determined by consumption patterns with Wet areas
having a relatively high per capita consumption and percentage of heavy drinkers and a relatively low
abstention rate. Alternative definitions of "wetness" in terms of alcohol policy and alcohol availability
could also be applied and future studies should address how these are related to the drinking outcome-
based definition of wetness. Early work utilizing data from the first National Alcohol Survey (NAS)
conducted in 1964 using nine Census-defined regions found the Northeast, North Central and Pacific
regions to be Wet and the South, Mountain and West North Central states to be Dry [1]. Further
analyses looking at the same nine census-defined regions in NAS surveys from 1979 and 1984 showed
the drier regions had become wetter since the 1960s but that Dry/Wet differences in both drinking
patterns and attitudes remained [1,2]. In these analyses the West North Central region was reclassified
from Dry to Wet and the West South Central and Mountain regions remained Dry in terms of
abstention rates but looked more like Wet regions in terms of heavy drinking and per capita
consumption.
Survey measures of consumption volume have been found to be highly correlated with per capita
apparent consumption [3] and survey estimates of drinking by college students have been found to be
linked to drinking patterns in the general population [4]. Some have suggested that the Southern states
appear to be dry by having higher abstention rates but actually have heavier drinking among those who
drink; however, an analysis of survey data across states did not find differences between the South and
other states in terms of heavy drinking among drinkers [5]. This may be because the marginal drinkers
who choose to abstain in a Dry environment would have been very light drinkers in a Wet
environment, making per drinker average consumption a poor measure for comparison due to the
typically skewed consumption distribution [6]. Religion has been found to be an important predictor of
current drinking and heavy drinking across US states with high religious adherence for Catholics being
associated with higher rates of drinking and heavy drinking, and higher adherence among Evangelical
Protestants associated with lower rates [7].
Survey-based models of the determinants and consequences of alcohol use typically utilize regional
control variables to capture unmeasured aspects of drinking culture [8]. Most US regional control
variables in multivariate models utilize either the nine or four census regions. Such analyses are
motivated by the notion that some variance is explained by characteristics associated with simple
geography. Having a set of such geographic variables based on empirical measures characterizing
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 271
states' drinking cultures should improve their usefulness. Analyses retaining indicators for all 50 states
are often not informative or feasible. Aggregate-level cross-section time-series models must pool
states' series in many cases, for example when estimating the effects of government policies on
alcohol use or the effects of alcohol consumption on mortality rates or in modeling other outcomes.
Knowing which states are similar to each other in terms of drinking culture, broadly defined, could
improve the selection of control states in models of interrupted time series aimed at detecting results of
a policy change, for instance. In either survey or aggregate analyses it would be preferable to utilize
groups of states that have been shown to have similar and linked drinking markets and/or cultures than
to employ arbitrarily composed contiguous geographic regions. An improved grouping scheme should
result in better precision of regional indicator variables for survey analyses and ideally yield more
homogeneous pooled state groupings for time-series analyses.
No studies have specifically tried to group states empirically based on drinking pattern and alcohol
sales data. Much more state-specific data is now available to fine tune these characterizations and to
begin to empirically define state groupings in terms of shared drinking culture. Measures
characterizing drinking culture in this study focus on the percentage of the population drinking five or
more (5+) drinks in a day in the past month, drinking at all in the past month and per capita apparent
alcohol consumption. This paper aims to categorize the US states into regional groups based on the
wetness of recent drinking patterns and to evaluate whether these groupings represent linked drinking
cultures over time through pair-wise analyses of trends in per capita apparent consumption of beer and
spirits within and outside of these regional groupings.
2. Methods
2.1. Data Sources
Survey estimates for each state are taken from synthetic state-level estimates for the 2005-2006
combined samples from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) of past month 5+
drinks in a day and past month drinking among those aged 12 and older and other age sub-groups.
These published estimates were used because to prevent identification, the public use files for this
survey do not include geographic identifiers [9]. The NSDUH survey is a face-to-face multi-stage
clustered probability sample of the US population with special attention to drug use related issues.
Alternative estimates of 5+ for men and 4+ for women drinks in a day in the past month from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 2007 are shown in Table 1 below for
comparison. The BRFSS survey utilizes state representative sampling; each state oversees the conduct
of an identical, large telephone survey on health risk behaviors [10].
Per capita (aged 15 and older) apparent alcohol consumption data for 1950 to 2002 and for 2005
are estimates from the Alcohol Research Group (ARG) state alcohol per capita ethanol database. Tax
and sales based estimates of per capita apparent consumption of beer, wine, spirits and total ethanol for
1950 to 2005 are calculated using %ABV conversions developed by ARG and population estimates are
from the US Census Bureau [11-13].
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 272
2.2. Methodology
State groupings were created based on geographic proximity and primarily on the estimate, from the
NSDUH 2005-2006 combined sample, of the percentage of those 12 and older drinking 5+ drinks in a
day on any day in the past month, as well as from the 2005 per capita apparent consumption of
alcohol. Also considered were the past month 5+/4+ binge measure taken form the 2007 BRFSS
survey and the past year abstention rate in the 2005-2006 NSDUH surveys. The NSDUH estimates are
seen as more reliable than the BRFSS estimates due to higher response rates and especially higher
reported volumes of drinking, implying better coverage of alcohol sales [14]. Per capita apparent
consumption figures are generally seen as the most reliable estimates of overall drinking, not being
subject to non-response and self-report biases. However, an exception to this rule is states with large
cross-border and/or tourist sales relative to their populations, particularly, Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii,
District of Columbia, New Hampshire and Delaware. Correlations between reporting 5+ drinks in a
day in the last month and monthly drinkers in the 2005-6 NSDUH, 2005 per capita apparent
consumption and 5+/4+ drinks in a day monthly based on the 2007 BRFSS were also calculated to
determine the degree to which these measures indicated similar rankings of states. The percentage of
past month drinkers reporting having 5+ drinks in any day in the past month in the 2005-6 NSDUH
was also calculated to illustrate the prevalence of heavy drinking among drinkers. Based primarily on
inspecting the proportion of heavy drinkers and per capita apparent consumption of alcohol, but also
considering the other measures, states were generally characterized as Wet, Moderate or Dry. States
within these categories were then grouped according to geographic proximity with some exceptions
made in order keep the number of groups relatively small and to include nearly all states in some
group. For example, Utah was grouped with the other Dry states that form a geographically contiguous
group in the South and the Moderate states in the South were grouped together although they do not all
share borders.
Following the grouping, based on cross-sectional results, data on trends in per capita apparent
consumption by beverage type were examined to give an indication of whether alcohol consumption
trends within the state groupings appear to move together and to have similar levels and general trends.
To establish whether relationships between states within a resultant regional grouping where stronger
and more common than those with states outside of the groupings, Granger Causality tests [15] were
estimated using Stata [16] between each pair of states for beer and spirits series. Wine was not
analyzed because summarizing test results was very labor intensive and wine is a relatively less
important beverage in the US. Granger Causality tests use lagged values of one series (e.g., per capita
beer consumption in Ohio) to predict the current value of another series (e.g., per capita beer
consumption in Iowa). These tests incorporated two lagged values and a 0.05 significance level was
used for rejecting the null hypothesis of no relationship. The proportion of significant relationships (in
either or both directions) between states within a group was then compared to the proportion with
states outside of the group to determine the relative degree to which beverage series trends were more
closely related within regional groups.

3. Results
Six state groups were identified by consideration of the variables mentioned in Methods, as shown
in Figure 1. With group titles that approximate the bulk of the included states, these groups are:
Wet
North Central- Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana,
Missouri, Ohio, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Wyoming
New England- Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont
Moderate
Middle Atlantic- Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania
Pacific- California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington
South Coast- Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, South Carolina, Texas
Dry
Dry South- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia
The District of Columbia was not grouped due to unique characteristics but if a complete grouping
is necessary for analytic purposes it would be included in the Middle Atlantic group. The District of
Columbia is situated between Maryland in the Middle Atlantic and Virginia in the Dry South but has
much higher alcohol consumption than both and differs in many ways, reflecting its unique features.
Other states were also difficult to clearly classify. Nevada has increased in the number residents
relative to visitors recently and now fits better into the Pacific region while Utah's drinking pattern fits
the Dry South although its drinking culture may not be closely linked to the other member states due to
geographic and cultural separation. New Hampshire is another special case where out-of-state buyers
inflate per capita apparent consumption estimates but residents' drinking in surveys clearly fits with
the New England group. Alaska also has a relatively high tourist/visitor impact and being
geographically separated from the contiguous mainland states it is difficult to place its drinking culture
in this environment. Figure 1 provides a visual presentation of these groups. Following this, Table 1
lists the percentage of the population drinking 5+ drinks in a day in the 2005-6 NSDUH for the age 12
and older group (used in the state grouping decision) and for sub-groups by age of 18 to 25 and 26 and
older. Also included are the past month percentage of drinkers and the percentage reporting 5+ days
among past month drinkers in the 2005-6 NSDUH, per capita apparent consumption for 2005 and the
percentage of the population 18 and older reporting past month 5+/4+ days in the 2007 BRFSS survey.
The states are listed in descending order by the past month 5+ percentages for those 12 and older in the
2005-6 NSDUH. Considering the regional groupings using the group name variable in terms of the
ordering by 5+ percentages shows the groups to make sense in terms of this ordering. The US average
is included for reference and all but one (Alaska) of the North Central states and all but one (Maine) of
the New England states are seen to be above this average. These are the two groups of states
represented as Wet. The Dry South states, seen as the Dry group, are all found below the US average.

The three middle groups, Pacific, Middle Atlantic and South Coast are more distributed both above
and below and are generally categorized as Moderate in terms of wetness.

Comparing the NSDUH estimates to those from the BRFSS and to per capita apparent consumption
illustrates a general but far from complete agreement (see Table 1). It is clear that the BRFSS estimates
are much lower than the NSDUH despite using a four drink threshold for heavy drinking among
women and having an age 18 and older, rather than 12 and older, sampling frame. At face, both of
these differences would be expected to lead to higher numbers in the BRFSS rather than lower.
Clearly, some combination of differences in the sampling strategy, response rate, mode of interview,
incentive payment and survey content led to less under-reporting in the NSDUH and may also imply
more stable estimates across states due to lower measurement error. Several of these potential sources
of bias were examined in a comparison of the 1999 and 2001 versions of each of these surveys but
none of the factors examined appeared to explain these differences [17]. The per capita apparent
consumption estimates are assessments of a state's average consumption volume rather than the
number of heavy drinkers and present an alternative metric for state comparisons. Because this was an
important variable considered in group assignment decisions, making allowance for the states where
this measure is biased by out-of-state drinkers, per capita consumption generally fits the state
groupings. However, some states like Ohio, Kansas and Iowa in the North Central group appear lower
on this measure indicating perhaps less moderate drinking along with a culture of heavy drinking.
Similarly, some of the states ranking lower in 5+ percentage appear higher in per capita consumption,
particularly those not in the Dry South group such as South Carolina, Oregon and New Mexico.
Correlations between the survey measures considered in the state group classifications were high
with a 0.73 correlation between the 2005-6 NSDUH 5+ measure and the 2007 BRFSS 5+/4+ measure
and a 0.82 correlation between the monthly 5+ and monthly drinking measures in the 2005-6 NSDUH.
A lower 0.44 correlation between the NSDUH 5+ measure and per capita apparent consumption in
2005 indicates some disparity between these two key measures. However, when states with cross
border and tourism issues are removed the correlation increases to 0.62, indicating somewhat better
agreement between these measures. Table 1 also illustrates that while there is a general
correspondence between the 18-25 age group and the older group in terms of 5+ drinkers, some states
stand out particularly in the 18-25 group. The New England states are especially high in this group
and are known for having relatively large numbers of college students and the associated heavy
episodic college drinking cultures. Some Middle Atlantic states, such as New Jersey, Delaware and
Pennsylvania, similarly have relatively high percentages of past month 5+ drinkers in the 18-25 group.
The percentage of past month drinkers who report having had 5+ drinks in a day gives an indication of
the distribution of heavy and moderate drinking among drinkers for each state. These percentages
range from a low of 38% in Maryland to a high of 54% in Utah, both states with relatively low levels
of 5+ drinkers. While there is no consistent pattern for this variable, higher percentages appear more
common among states with the highest and lowest percentages of 5+ drinkers in their populations
while lower percentages more commonly occur in the Moderate states.
Figures 2, 3 and 4 illustrate trends in per capita beer, spirits and wine sales for each of the six state
groupings. Although national trends lead to similarities between the groups and some persistent outlier
states are seen, the six groupings are generally confirmed in terms of similarity in levels and trends.
The Dry South states appear to be especially linked and different from the rest of the US.

In some cases, contrasting trends are evident such as the increasing beer consumption in the South
Coast and Dry South states compared to the decreasing consumption in the Middle Atlantic states. For
spirits, the shapes of most states trends are similar but the levels of consumption and the degree of the
rising and falling pattern differ.
Figures summarizing the results of Granger Causality test comparisons of relationships between
spirits and beer series within and outside of regional state groupings are presented in Table 2. The
percentage of states within a grouping that have significant predictive relationships with each other is
compared to the percentage of these relationships with states outside the grouping. These results do not
consistently support the hypothesis that regional groupings will have more closely related
beverage-specific trends in per capita apparent consumption. Some state groups were found to have a
higher proportion of related state trends than outside relationships; spirits for Pacific and South Coast
and beer for Dry South, North Central and New England. However, in all other cases the opposite was
found or the proportion of relationships was the same. High percentages of relationships were found
overall indicating that national trends are generally more important for US states than regional trends.

states within each state grouping compared to states outside the grouping for states in each

on another state's series.

4. Discussion
Six groups of states were created by a qualitative inspection of several considerations: geographic
proximity, recent (2005-7) survey measures of drinking patterns and per capita apparent consumption
of alcohol in each jurisdiction. The degree to which these state drinking groups appear to be linked
was assessed through time trends in per capita apparent consumption of beer, wine, spirits over the
1950 to 2002 period. Shared drinking measure trajectories are seen both within and across the defined
groups suggesting some cohesiveness in regional drinking cultures as well as shared national trends.
However, the results of Granger Causality tests designed to indicate predictive relationships between
states did not find consistent evidence that state trends within these groups were more closely linked
than trends between states in different groups for the beer and spirits beverage types. National trends in
US alcohol consumption including rising consumption in the 1960's and early 1970's and declining
consumption in the 1980's as well as a shift from spirits to beer from about 1975 to 1995 can be seen
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7 281
in many of the states [13]. These changes, while not entirely understood, have been attributed to birth
cohort differences in beverage preference and life-course drinking patterns [8,18] and to changes in
alcohol policy such as the lowering and later raising of the minimum drinking age [19] and changes in
policies and attitudes toward drunk driving in the 1980's [20,21]. The national trends appear to
dominate the state-grouping-specific trends. Despite the lack of clear validation for the grouping in
terms of linked drinking patterns over time within the six groups, the groups are differentiated
cross-sectionally and represent an empirically-based identification of US state regions varying in
wetness versus dryness, suitable for use in the analyses of alcohol-consumption and related behaviors
and outcomes. The simplified three group distinction between Wet, Moderate and Dry states represents
a nested alternative grouping focused on drinking patterns and mean consumption levels.
Future studies at the individual-level should utilize and compare the efficacy of these two nested
groupings to evaluate differences in drinking patterns, attitudes towards alcohol, and alcohol-related
problems and outcomes in US surveys offering detailed measures of these constructs such as the
National Alcohol Survey (NAS) and the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol Related
Conditions (NESARC). These groups should also be valuable for defining pooled models and matched
control groups for cross-section time-series analyses of alcohol policy effectiveness and in estimating
relationships between alcohol use measures and mortality or other outcomes in aggregate analyses at
the US state level. Tests of the homogeneity of state time-series relationships between alcohol sales
and specific mortality causes within and across these groups should also be undertaken to further
evaluate group cohesiveness.
This paper updates the analyses of US drinking regions last considered over 20 years ago by
Alcohol Research Group scientists [1,2]. The availability of state-specific alcohol pattern measures
and long-term trend data on alcohol sales has greatly improved the information on which these
regional groups are based. A large group of states in the North Central region and the New England
states are found to clearly stand out in terms of having high proportions of heavy occasion drinkers and
high per capita apparent consumption of alcohol, while a large group of mostly Southern states are
found to stand out as relatively low on these measures. The groups incorporate a variety of differing
alcohol availability policies and tax levels suggesting the importance of exploring cultural factors such
as religion and religious involvement [7,22], race and ethnicity [23-25] and more detailed framings of
ethnic origin [26]. These findings also suggest the importance of taking account of surrounding
environments in alcohol abuse prevention efforts [27] and the implementation of effective alcohol
policies [28], as appears to be particularly needed in the North Central and New England states.
