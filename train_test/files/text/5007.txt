Introduction
The purpose of this article is to validate the Health Care
Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) ­ a unique measure of the
patient perspective concerning their autonomy in medical
settings. Patient autonomy is a central value in Western
medicine (Beauchamp and Childress, 2001; Varelius, 2006)
and one of the three fundamental principles of the Charter
on Medical Professionalism (Medical Professionalism
Project, 2002). Accordingly, this principle states that "phy-
sicians must have respect for patient autonomy ... be honest
with their patients and empower them to make informed
decisions about their treatment" (Medical Professionalism
Project, 2002: p.1). This recent official adoption of patient
autonomy as a part of the physicians' charter thus indicates
that health care practitioners are now responsible for pro-
moting both autonomy and well-being in their patients
(Beauchamp and Childress, 2001; Ng etal., 2012; Medical
Professionalism Project, 2002).
According to Self-Determination Theory, patients'sense
of autonomy represents a critical component of their moti-
vational profile (Patrick and Williams, 2012; Ryan and
Deci, 2006; Ryan etal., 2008; Williams etal., 1996, 1998a,
1998b, 2000). In health care settings, autonomous motiva-
tion is of particular importance concerning patient adher-
ence to medical advice, treatment and disease prevention.
According to Sox (2002), "`the center of patient care is not
in the physician's office or the hospital. It is where people

Abstract
Patient autonomy is a central value in medicine and critical component of adherence to medical advice. This article
reports on a validation of the 6-item version of the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), a measure of
autonomy support in health care settings, in a sample of 242 melanoma patients. The HCCQ showed excellent internal
consistency (=.91), structural validity (Tucker­Lewis index=.99; comparative fit index=.99; root mean square error

per cent confidence interval (.00, .11); standardized root mean square residual
=

Acceptable 3-month test­retest reliability was observed (r=.55, p
<
.001; intraclass correlation coefficient (A, 1)=.54,
p<.001). The French version was found equivalent to the English version.

live their lives, in the home and the workplace. There,
patients make the daily choices that determine their health"
(p. 243). Unfortunately, the choices made by patients do not
always contribute to better health outcomes. For example,
non-adherence to medication ranges from 25 to 50per cent
and is associated with more hospital admissions and medi-
cal complications (Beck etal., 1985; Claxton etal., 2001;
Haynes etal., 2002; Nieuwlaat etal., 2014; Payero etal.,
2014; Sokol etal., 2005). In addition to health problems
experienced by the patients, there are significant financial
costs associated with greater hospitalization, medical tests,
and treatments due to patient non-compliance (Berg etal.,
1993; Iuga and McGuire, 2014; Roebuck etal., 2011; Sokol
etal., 2005). Moreover, the current methods of increasing
adherence tend to be complex in nature and largely ineffec-
tive (Haynes etal., 2002; McDonald etal., 2002; Nieuwlaat
etal., 2014).
Why do patients not follow medical advice? From the
perspective of the patient, the seemingly irrational act of
non-compliance may be perceived as having a rational
basis (e.g., unfavourable cost­benefit analysis or lacking
sufficiently persuasive reasons to comply; DiMatteo etal.,
2007; Donovan and Blake, 1992). Moreover, given that
patient beliefs concerning their personal circumstances,
prior knowledge and medical options are salient anteced-
ents of their subsequent health-related decision-making;
their personal beliefs concerning medical issues and physi-
cian support are indeed worthy of empirical study (Donovan
and Blake, 1992; Vermeire etal., 2001). Patient involve-
ment in the treatment process and the relationship between
the patient and health care professionals are among the core
elements of patient-centered care internationally (Kitson
etal., 2013). Furthermore, an autonomy-supportive climate
of mutual understanding, trust, and shared decision-making
between the patient and the physician has been found to be
conducive to discussing patients' concerns, increasing
adherence and facilitating patient participation, each of
which corresponds to various positive outcomes (Greene
and Hibbard, 2012; Hibbard and Greene, 2013).
For instance, greater communication between the patient
and the health care team has been found to improve not
only treatment adherence but also patient satisfaction
(Burnier, 2000; Donovan, 1995; Fuertes etal., 2007; Ha
and Longnecker, 2010; Hillen etal., 2011). Additionally,
more effective provider­patient communication is associ-
ated with greater work satisfaction, less work-related stress,
and lower burnout for medical professionals that, in turn,
can facilitate patient adherence and satisfaction with care
(DiMatteo etal., 1993; Ha and Longnecker, 2010; Pepper
etal., 2012; Stavropoulou, 2011; Zolnierek and DiMatteo,
2009). With respect to the qualities of effective communi-
cation, findings suggest that shared decision-making, pre-
senting options, addressing patients' concerns, and mutual
trust are critical to patient­physician relationships and
health outcomes (Ha and Longnecker, 2010; Hillen etal.,
2011; Stavropoulou, 2011). It is these key aspects of com-
munication between a health care provider and a patient
that are captured by the Health Care Climate Questionnaire
developed by Williams etal. (2000) in which patients' per-
ceptions concerning autonomy-supportive nature of the
health care climate are specifically assessed.
The HCCQ has been used in research for over 20years
to measure patients' perceptions concerning the extent of
autonomy support provided by their health care providers
(Fortier et
al., 2007; Kasser and Ryan, 1999; Williams
etal., 1996, 1998b, 1998c, 1999, 2002, 2006). According to
Williams etal. (2000: p. 81), autonomy support in health
care settings "refers to providers' interacting with patients
by taking full account of their perspectives, affording
choice, offering information, encouraging self-initiation,
providing a rationale for recommended actions, and
accepting the patients' decisions" (p. 81). The HCCQ was
designed specifically to assess these specific aspects of
autonomy support in health care environments. It was
developed based on prior work with similar questionnaires
in non-health care settings (Williams etal., 1996), and can
be adapted for use with various medical professionals
including physicians, nurses and dieticians (Williams etal.,
1998b). However, given limited published research to date
on the empirical validation of the HCCQ, the purpose of
this study was to assess the validity and reliability of this
self-report measure. Given that researchers and clinicians
alike typically prefer less intrusive measures that perform
optimally, the short 6-item version of the original 15-item
scale was examined with respect to internal consistency,
structural and construct validity, test­retest reliability, as
well as descriptive and item-specific statistics.
Scale validation was conducted in a hospital-based sam-
ple of patients diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer. This
population was selected due to clinical guidelines recom-
mending long-term adherence to a skin self-examination
(SSE) regimen for melanoma survivors (Coit etal., 2009),
thereby affording a sufficiently intensive examination of
patient autonomy in the context of medical adherence. In
addition to scale validation, the second study objective was
to examine English­French language equivalency in terms
of mean level differences as well as contrasting internal con-
sistency, structural validity, and item/scale descriptives
between the English and French samples. French was chosen
as a second language due to the measure having previously
been employed in French samples (e.g. Fortier etal., 2007)
despite no published scale validation for the French version.
Method
Participants
The study sample consisted of patients diagnosed with mel-
anoma skin cancer treated at two major teaching hospitals
in Montreal, Canada. Eligibility criteria included the ability
Czajkowska et al. 3
to read either English or French, being at least 18years of
age and having a medically confirmed diagnosis of mela-
noma. In total, 15per cent were diagnosed with melanoma
in situ (stage 0), 48.7
per cent with stage I, 18.7
per cent
with stage II, 6.2
per cent with stage III and 3.6
per cent
with stage IV melanoma.
Materials
Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ). The HCCQ was
utilized to assess the degree to which the participants per-
ceived their physicians as supportive of their autonomy as
opposed to controlling in nature (Williams etal., 1996).
Sample items include `I feel that my doctor has provided
me choices and options', `My doctor tries to understand
how I see things before suggesting a new way to do things'
and `My doctor encourages me to ask questions'. Each item
was rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The language of the scale is
devoid of jargon, double negative statements, and advanced
vocabulary to optimize accessibility for individuals across
education levels. Similar to the original 15-item scale hav-
ing excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha
()
=
.95) and a 1-factor structure (Williams etal., 1996),
high internal consistency (Cronbach's =.96) and a 1-fac-
tor structure were also obtained in the current sample.
Comprising items from the original 15-item version, the
shorter 6-item scale includes items 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 (Self-
Determination Theory, 2017). Similar short versions with
four (Williams et
al., 1999), five (Williams et
al., 1996,
1998b, 2002) and seven items (Kasser and Ryan, 1999) have
previously demonstrated acceptable to excellent internal con-
sistency (.72
Cronbach's 
.96) and reflected a 1-factor
structure (Fortier et
al., 2007; Kasser and Ryan, 1999;
Williams etal., 1996, 1998b, 1998c, 1999, 2002, 2006). For
the purposes of this study, the 6-item version was adminis-
tered following from a recommendation of this version by the
scale authors (Self-DeterminationTheory, 2017).The 15-item
version was additionally administered to examine correla-
tions between the full and 6-item scale versions.
Other measures.Socio-demographic data (age, gender,
years of education, etc.) and need for additional services
(e.g. to spend more time with the physician) were assessed
via a self-report survey. Time since diagnosis and cancer
stage were additionally collected from patients' medical
files and hospital tumour registries. The Physician Support
of Skin Self-Examination Scale assessed the patients' per-
spective of their doctors' encouragement of skin self-
examination (SSE) (Coroiu et al., 2017). Patients'self-efficacy
for SSE was assessed using Skin Self-Examination Self-
Efficacy Scale (Bergeron et al., 2017). The Skin Cancer
Index (SCI) was used to measure patients' worries specific
to skin cancer (proposed by the original authors as a meas-
ure of quality of life; Matthews etal., 2006; Rhee etal.,
2007), while the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 was used
to assess psychological distress with respect to depressive
and anxiety symptoms (Kroenke etal., 2010).
Procedure
Design.Ethics approval was obtained from the universi-
ty's faculty of medicine research ethics board. This spe-
cific study was conducted at two teaching hospitals as part
of a larger, longitudinal project examining how psychoso-
cial variables correspond with adherence to medical advice
during melanoma follow-up clinical care. Further proce-
dural details are outlined in a published study protocol
(Körner etal., 2013).
Translation.There exists no official validated French ver-
sion of the HCCQ despite its previous use in English­
French bilingual settings (e.g. Fortier et
al., 2007).
Consequently, a professional translator was employed to
translate the HCCQ as per a cross-cultural translation tech-
nique (Banville etal., 2000). First, a professional translator
from Québec, Canada (study location) fluent in both Eng-
lish and French translated the HCCQ from the original
English into French. Second, a bilingual individual without
access to the original version back-translated the measure
into English. Third, the original and back-translated ver-
sions were compared and consensus on the final version
was reached between both translators. The 7-item response
format was retained from the English version (1=fortement
en désaccord, 3=neuter, 7=fortement en accord). The
translated questionnaire items are presented in Table 1.
Analyses. The validation analyses were principally conducted
using baseline data (Time 1) from the longitudinal project to
afford the greatest number of participants (N=242). To eval-
uate test­retest reliability, data from Time 2 (6-month lag,
N=109) and Time 3 (9-month lag, N=112) were additionally
assessed. First calculated were item means, standard devia-
tions (SDs), Cronbach's  if item deleted, inter-item correla-
tions, corrected item-total correlations and factor loadings, as
well as the scale mean and SD. Second, the correlation with
the full scale (15-item version) was calculated, followed by
Cronbach's  and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for
the 6-item scale. Construct validity was evaluated by com-
paring the HCCQ to similar and dissimilar constructs using
Pearson's r and point biserial correlations. Reproducibility of
the HCCQ scores (test­retest reliability) was assessed by
correlating Time 2 and Time 3 data using the intraclass cor-
relation coefficient (ICC). Additionally, floor and ceiling
effects were investigated.
Equivalency between the English and French versions
was examined by (a) correlating language with the HCCQ
score, (b) comparing group means, (c) comparing CFA fit
and factor loadings between the English and French sub-
samples, (d) comparing overall Cronbach's s and
4 Health Psychology Open 
item-corrected Cronbach's s of the English and French
groups and (e) comparing item-level analytics (inter-item
correlations, item-total correlations, item means).
Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted using Mplus
statistical software (version 7.0; Muthén and Muthén,
1998­2015), with the remaining analyses conducted using
Predictive Analysis Software (PASW version 18; SPSS,
Inc., 2009).
Results
Descriptive and item analyses
Item means were similar in magnitude ranging from 4.74 to
5.64 (SD
=
1.44­1.68) with an average item mean of 5.29
(average mean across all individual item means). Similarly,
the means for the entire scale (regardless of single items
deleted) remained within a range of 1 point (from 26.09 to
26.98). The inter-item correlations ranged from .55 to .75
(p<.001 for all). Furthermore, corrected item-total correla-
tions were high and comparable across items (ranging from
.68 to .82) as were the Cronbach's s if item deleted
(ranging from .88 to .90). The short, 6-item version of the
questionnaire correlated very highly with the original,
15-item version (r=.95, p<.001). Additionally, all items
showed excellent factor loadings (Tabachnick and Fidell,
2013; for more details on the structural validity see the next
section). Additional details regarding the analyses described
above can be found in Table 2.
Internal consistency and structural validity
Cronbach's  was high (=.91) indicating excellent internal
consistency(Streiner,2003;Terweeetal.,2007).Furthermore,
as the HCCQ is considered a 1-factor scale (Williams etal.,
1996, 1998b), a confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) was
conducted to corroborate previous findings. A total of 235
participants' data were used in this analysis allowing for suf-
ficient power to detect a model fit (Terwee etal., 2007). A
CFA with maximum likelihood estimation showed an excel-
lent fit following Hu and Bentley's as well as Kline's criteria

confidence interval (CI) (.00, .11); standardized root mean
square residual (SRMR)=.02; 2 (8, N=235)=13.99, p=.08).
The factor loadings ranged from .74 to .90.
Construct validity
As per recommendations by Terwee etal. (2007), construct
validity was established by testing hypotheses on how the
HCCQ should correspond to similar and dissimilar constructs
through correlations, pertinent single items as well as soci-
odemographic and medical data (see Measures). In total, 12
of 13 hypotheses (listed in Table 3) were supported (92.31%)
providing evidence for the construct validity of HCCQ (for
more details see Table 3; Terwee etal., 2007). One hypothesis
was not supported, specifically that involving the Emotional
subscale of the Skin Cancer Index (SCI) such that a moderate
correlation was expected but no significant correlation was
observed. Thus, general sense of distress (Patient Health
Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4)) did correspond negatively with the
HCCQ, whereas specific symptoms of distress as assessed by
the emotional subscale of SCI (e.g. embarrassment about can-
cer and worries) did not relate to perceived autonomy as
measured by the HCCQ.
Reproducibility
Test­retest reliability was established by correlating Time
2 and Time 3 data (gathered 3
months apart) and

computing the intraclass correlation agreement (ICC).
The data from T2 and T3 showed a strong correlation
(Cohen, 1988) which is notable given the time lag and the
possibility of some patients having consulted different
physicians during this period (r=.55, p<.001).
Additionally, the ICC was calculated to assess test­retest
reliability (Weir, 2005). Unlike Pearson's r, the ICC
accounts for both consistency of performances from test
to retest (within-subject change), as well as change in
average performance of participants as a group over time
(i.e. systematic change in the mean; Vaz et
al., 2013).
Using a two-way random effects model (McGraw and
Wong, 1996), ICC values showed reliability to be ade-
quate (ICC (A, 1)=.54, p<.001 ­ equivalent to ICC (2, 1)
in Shrout and Fleiss' (1979) notation).
Floor and ceiling effects
The lowest possible score of 6 was obtained by 1per cent of
the sample, and the highest possible score of 42 was
obtained by 10.8
per cent of the sample. Thus, based on
McHorney and Tarlov's (1995) criteria, no floor or ceiling
effects were detected.
English­French equivalency
We further examined differences between the English and
French versions of the HCCQ concerning group means,
dimensionality, and internal consistency. First, the correla-
tion between the HCCQ score and language was not sig-
nificant (rpb
=­.03, p
=
.67). Second, HCCQ scale means
were very similar between the English and French subsam-
ples (MEn
=31.92, SD=7.78; MFr
=31.48, SD=7.51) as
indicated by a nonsignificant t-test (t(218)=.43, p=.67).
Third, average item means (average across all individual
item means) were only .07 apart with each item mean fall-
ing into similar ranges for each subgroup (MEn
=5.32,
range: 4.72­5.79, SD=1.42­1.75; MFr
=5.25, range: 4.76­
5.59, SD=1.42­1.62). Similarly, inter-item correlations for
the subgroups showed comparable ranges (English: .53­
.76; French: .54­.79). Finally, corrected item-total correla-
tions were high and comparable across the items (English:
.67­.81; French: .69­.83).
Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted for the
English and the French subgroups separately using a max-
imum likelihood estimation and showed very good model
fits (see Hu and Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2013): English:
(n=119): TLI=.96; CFI=.97; RMSEA=.11, 90per cent
CI (.05, .17); SRMR=.03; 2 (9, N=119)=22.12, p<.01;
French: (n=115): TLI=.99; CFI=.996; RMSEA=.04, CI
(.00, .12); SRMR=.02; 2 (8, N=115)=9.62, p=.29. Data
from the French subgroup indicated slightly better model
fit than for the English subgroup. The factor loadings in
the English subsample ranged from .69 to .87 and in the
French subsample ranged from .75 to .92. Finally,
observed Cronbach's s for the two subscales were excel-
lent (English: =.91; French: 
=
.90) and remained in
similar ranges when an item was deleted (English:
.89.91; French: .87.90). Overall, it can be con-
cluded that the scale performed equally well in English
and French, and thus can be considered valid for use in
these two languages.
Discussion and conclusion
Discussion
The HCCQ was first introduced over 20years ago (Williams
etal., 1996) and has been used in numerous studies (Fortier
etal., 2007; Kasser and Ryan, 1999; Williams etal., 1996,
1998b, 1998c, 1999, 2002, 2006). Despite its popularity,
however, the measure has not been formally empirically
examined as to its reliability and validity. First, there is lit-
tle by way of detailed psychometric information on the
6-item version of the HCCQ, and only limited data on other
short versions with four (Williams etal., 1999, 1998c) five
(Williams et
al., 1998b, 1996c, 2002) and seven items
(Kasser and Ryan, 1999). Accordingly, the present valida-
tion analyses of the 6-item official (Self-Determination
Theory, 2017) brief HCCQ were conducted to address this
research gap.
Second, whereas the scale has been used in French, there
is presently no published information as to its psychometric
properties. Thus, not only is a valid French version neces-
sary for conducting research using the HCCQ with
Francophone participants, one must evaluate the corre-
spondence between the English and French versions to be
able to directly compare data from French and English
studies using this measure. Consequently, we translated the
HCCQ and evaluated the reliability and validity of the scale
in both languages in samples of English- and French-
speaking melanoma patients.
Overall, the 6-item HCCQ demonstrated excellent valid-
ity and reliability with respect to internal consistency, struc-
tural validity, and construct validity.Additionally, acceptable
3-month test­retest reliability was observed, and floor or
ceiling effects were not detected. Furthermore, the compari-
son of French and English versions in terms of scale means,
structural validity, and internal consistency did not reveal
significant differences between the two subsamples indicat-
ing equivalence of performance in these two languages.
Nevertheless, specific limitations warrant discussion.
First, the data in the present analyses are based on a sample
of modest size, that although is adequate (minimum 10 par-
ticipants per item, minimum 100 data points overall for the
CFAs; Terwee etal., 2007), did not significantly exceed
standard benchmarks (115 in the French subsample, 119 in
the English subsample). Second, in our examination of con-
struct validity, it was not possible to compare the HCCQ to
another gold standard measure of the `health care climate'
Czajkowska et al. 7
or `health care provider support of patient autonomy' as no
such measures exist. Thus, the measures used to establish
construct validity were not redundant but instead repre-
sented close approximations to the construct proposed to be
captured by the HCCQ.
Third, whereas it is recommended that reliability testing
of health status questionnaires be conducted 1 or 2
weeks
apart ­ long enough for the participants to forget scale items
but short enough for no significant change to occur (Terwee
et
al., 2007) ­ the present lag was 3
months with some
patients likely having consulted different physicians between
Time 2 and Time 3. Given the substantial time lag, we con-
sider the strong correlation and the adequate ICC as indica-
tive of robust test­retest reliability. Given these limitations,
future research to validate the HCCQ in different populations
with larger samples and shorter retest lags are encouraged.
Finally, as the analyses were conducted for patients specifi-
cally diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer, the utility of the
HCCQ in other populations warrants investigation.
Conclusion
The brief, 6-item version of the Health Care Climate
Questionnaire is a reliable and valid measure of perceived physi-
cian support of autonomy among patients diagnosed with mela-
noma, as administered in both English and French languages.
Practice implications
To our knowledge, the use of the Health Care Climate
Questionnaire in clinical practice has not been reported in
the existing literature, and we hope that validating the
measure will open doors to its potential use outside of
research. The HCCQ-6 is recommended as a reliable and
valid measure for use in future research and clinical prac-
tice to assess patients' perceived autonomy in both
Anglophone and Francophone populations.
