The relationship of dietary fish intake to level of pulmonary function in the first National
Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES I). J. Schwartz, S.T. Weiss. ERS Journals Ltd
1994.
ABSTRACT: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which predominates in marine fish,
tends to counteract and inhibit the uptake and incorporation of arachidonic acid
and membrane phospholipids and dilute arachidonic acid as a potential substrate
for oxidation. Thus, fish intake may be protective for the occurrence of asthma
and other pulmonary diseases.
We wanted to examine the relationship between the effect of chronic dietary
intake to fish and its relationship to level of pulmonary function. We performed
this analysis using data from the First National Health and Nutritional Examination
Survey (NHANES I). A detailed subsample of 2,526 adults had a medical history
questionnaire, that included a 24-hour dietary recall, and performed spirometric
examination. Log of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV
1
) served as a
dependent variable in regression analysis which included an adjustment for height,
age, cigarette smoking and gender.
When added to the regression model including the above variables dietary fish
intake showed a protective association with FEV
1
(=0.008±0.004, p=0.028). When
smokers were excluded from the analysis, the effect of fish intake on pulmonary
function appeared to increase slightly (=0.0108±0.006, p=0.61).
These data suggest that chronic dietary intake of fish is associated with higher
levels of pulmonary function and is consistent with the hypothesis of an effect of
fish oil on arachidonic acid metabolism.

Fatty acids are essential nutrients that are incorporated
into a variety of cell membranes. These fatty acids, speci-
fically linoleic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic
are found in varying amounts in the human diet and are
metabolized to arachidonic acid. The further metabolism
of arachidonic acid, by cyclooxygenase and lipoxy-
genase pathways, yields a variety of prostenoids and
leukotrienes which are potentially toxic to cell mem-
branes, smooth muscle, and epithelial and endothelial
surfaces. In contrast, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which
predominates in marine fish, tends to counteract and
inhibit the uptake and incorporation of arachidonic acid
into membrane phospholipids and dilute arachidonic acid
as a potential substrate for oxidization. The relatively
low prevalences of coronary heart disease and asthma
among Eskimos and other populations who have high
dietary intake of EPA have suggested the hypothesis that
fish intake may be protective for the occurrence of asthma
and other diseases [1]. To date, no population based
study has examined the effect of chronic dietary intake
of fish and its relationship to level of pulmonary function.
We chose to examine this hypothesis using dietary intake
data from the First National Health and Nutrition Survey
(NHANES I).
Materials and methods
The First National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES I) was conducted at 90 locations across
the United States between 1971 and 1975 [2]. The initial
survey was collected in 1971­1974. An augmentation
survey of adults only, with no dietary information, was
collected in 1974­1975. Before medical examinations
were performed, trained interviewers visited the subjects
in their homes to administer socioeconomic and medical
history questionnaires. A detailed sub-sample of 3,478
subjects aged 30 or older was given a more detailed
medical history questionnaire and a spirometric examin-
ation. The detailed subsample was also representative
of the U.S. population. This included standard respiratory
questions from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute questionnaire on chronic respiratory disease.
They also included smoking history, including whether
the subject had ever smoked one hundred cigarettes,
current number of cigarettes smoked per day, maximal
cigarettes per day, years of smoking, and years since
quitting. A Food Frequency questionnaire asked about
usual consumption of fish in the past three months.
Intake of fish was coded as portions per week. Inter-
viewers and medical examiners who conducted the
NHANES I survey were specially trained to ensure that
conduct of the survey at each site was standardized.
Spirometric examinations were performed using an
Ohio Medical Instruments Corporation Model 800 elec-
tronic spirometer, a storage x-y oscilloscope that displayed
flow-volume curves for monitoring purposes, a single
channel linear script chart recorder, and a data acquisi-
tion unit to encode, convert, and record on digital tape
the spirometry signals. A pneumatic 5 litre calibration
procedure was performed at the beginning of each session
on each day. The electronic portion of the instrumentation
was calibrated before each subject was tested. Barometric
pressure, temperature, saturated (BPTS) correction factors
were computed and encoded. Further details have been
published elsewhere [3].
All subjects were given a complete physical examination
by a physician before they performed the spirometric
examination. Subjects who were pregnant, or had acute
or chronic medical conditions that the physician felt made
a spirometry manoeuvre inappropriate were excluded
from the spirometry examination. At least five trials
were required for a test set to be complete for an individual.
The best trial was defined as the trial with the maximum
sum of forced vital capacity FVC and forced expiratory
volume in one second (FEV
1
) from at least two repro-
ducible and error free trials. If reproducibility was not
achieved the subjects were excluded from the analysis.
Further details have been published [3]. The data from
the NHANES I were compared to results from the Harvard
Six City Study, and, adjusting for height and age, the
results were essentially identical [3]. These exclusions
reduced the potential sample size from 3,478 to 2,526.
As noted previously, the variance of the pulmonary
function measurements increases with height and age [3].
Logarithmic transformation of the pulmonary function
measurements achieved homoscedastic residuals with
respect to height and age. Hence regression analyses
were done using log (FEV
1
) as the dependent variable.
The units of the dependent variable are the log of the ml
of FEV
1
. Age and height were also converted to their
natural logarithm transformation in the analysis. In a
regression of the logarithm of lung function against an
explanatory variable, the coefficient of the variable is
easily related to the percent difference from predicted by
the equation:
100 × (exp () - 1) = % difference from predicted
for a unit change in the explanatory variable.
Cigarette smoking is clearly an important predictor of
FEV
1
. To assure our assessment of dietary fish intake
was not confounded by any correlation with smoking,
we first developed the best models we could using smoking
variables, before examining fish intake. Current cigarettes
per day were used to index the effect of current smoking.
We note that a model for the logarithm of FEV
1
is a
multiplicative model, so the distinction between main
effects and interactions is less clear. Lung function may
not decrease linearly with cigarettes per day, so a square
root transform of cigarettes per day was also considered
as a variable in the models. Such a transformation has
proved superior to the untransformed variable in evaluating
the association of cigarette smoking with markers of
inflammation such as peripheral white cell counts [4].
Cumulative smoking may be described either by pack
years or by years smoked. We considered both possi-
bilities. Again, square root transforms of pack years and
years smoked were also considered. A dummy variable
for former smokers was also examined. The different
combinations of terms for current and past smoking were
examined, and the terms that best fit the model were
chosen. Interaction terms were included only if at least
marginally significant (p<0.10). Once the smoking model
was developed, we considered the impact of dietary fish
intake on FEV
1
. Dietary fish intake is strongly asso-
ciated with socioeconomic status. To test whether that
might be confounding any observed association, we re-
estimated our regression controlling for family income.
This reduced the sample size by 103 individuals who did
not provide such data. We also examined whether the
impact of fish consumption varied by age or gender. To
avoid a major loss of power, this was done by testing
interaction terms for fish consumption by females, and
for fish consumption in persons over the age of 52 yrs.
The NHANES I survey was a stratified clustered sample,
with all the subjects being drawn from the 90 geographic
sites. Subjects who live in the same area are often more
alike on certain characteristics than subjects randomly
chosen from the population. If those characteristics are
important for the outcomes being studied, and are not
perfectly controlled for, there is likely to be correlation
between the residuals from subjects within each site. We
have dealt with these design effects by incorporating a
random site effect into our analysis. In addition, we
have estimated robust variance estimates. This method
gives standard errors for the regression coefficients that
are asymptotically unbiased even if the correlation in the
residuals is not perfectly specified. To estimate these
random site effects and robust variances, we have used
the Generalized Estimating Equations of ZEGER and LIANG
[5]. The GEE macro of M.R. Karim of the Department
of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and
Public Health was used.
Results
The distribution of variables used in this analysis is
shown in table 1. Table 2 compares subjects without
spirometry to those with spirometry values. Subjects
without spirometry values were more likely to have asthma
or bronchitis, more likely to be a smoker, and had greater
pack yrs of exposure. The square root transform of
cigarettes per day was a better predictor of FEV
1
than a
linear form. The baseline model is shown in table 3.

When added to the baseline model dietary fish intake
showed a protective association with FEV
1
(=0.0088±
0.0040, p=0.028). When current asthmatic or bron-
chitic subjects were excluded, the impact of dietary fish
intake did not change significantly (=0.0080±0.0042,
p=0.059). When smokers were excluded, the effect of
fish intake appeared to increase slightly (=0.0108±0.0058,
p=0.061). When fish intake was divided into categories,
a stepped dose-response relationship was observed.
Compared to subjects who consumed fewer than one
portion of fish per week, subjects who consumed one
portion per week had a covariate adjusted 1.35% higher
FEV
1
(SEM=1.35%), and subjects consuming more than
one portion per week had a covariate adjusted 2.51 higher
FEV
1
(SEM=1.16%). The test for trend across the categories
was significant (p=0.04). Controlling for family income
had little effect on the association between dietary fish
intake and FEV
1
, except for the reduction in sample size
(=0.0085±0.0043, p=0.048). There was no evidence of
a different slope for dietary fish intake in females (p=0.46)
or older subjects (p=0.60).
Discussion
In a sample of 2,526 adult subjects aged 30­70 yrs
from the First National Health and Nutrition Survey we
found a monotonic relationship between dietary por-
tions of fish per week and the natural logorithm of
predicted FEV
1
. The magnitude of the level of effect
observed in this study was 115 ml difference in FEV
1
between those eating fish less than once a week and those
eating fish more than once a week. This relationship
was insensitive to the exclusion of currently sympto-
matic asthmatic or bronchitic subjects. The effect size
was slightly larger when smokers were excluded from
the analysis. Finally, dietary fish intake did not appear
to be a proxy for socioeconomic status.
To our knowledge, no epidemiologic studies have been
performed concerning the relationship between dietary
fish intake and any respiratory outcome. Short term
physiologic studies have yielded conflicting results on
the relationship of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
and its effect on asthma. KIRSCH and co-workers studied
the effect of EPA on 12 adult asthmatic patients [6].
Pulmonary function tests were done at baseline and at
3, 6, 10, 12 and 14 wks after ingesting either a low dose
EPA (0.1 g·day-1) or high dose EPA (4.0 g·day-1) for a
total of 8 weeks. No significant effect of either high or
low dose EPA ingestion on pulmonary function was
noted. However, this study did note an alteration, in
both the high and the low dose groups, in leukocyte
function in patients with asthma. This effect was to
decrease the leukocyte content of arachidonic acid and
the generation of the leukotriene B
4
(LTB
4
) and prosta-
glandin E
2
(PGE
2
) from arachidonic acid. Only the high
dose EPA, however, led to significant inhibition of
polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis. No signifi-
cant effect on symptoms was noted in this investigation.
PARM and co-workers studied 20 adult subjects with mild
asthma [7]. Twelve subjects received capsules contain-
ing 3.2 g of the EPA and 2.2 g of docosahexaenoic acid
daily, and 8 asthmatic subjects received placebo cap-
sules containing olive oil for 10 wks in a double-blind
fashion. Airways responsiveness to histamine, diurnal
peak flow variability, symptoms scores and bronchodilator

use were unchanged by fish oil supplementation. This
study confirmed the results of KIRSCH et al. [6] in that
neutrophil leukotriene B
4
generation was decreased by
EPA. In addition, neutrophil chemotaxis was substantially
and significantly suppressed.
PAYAN et al. [8] examined two groups of 6 adult asth-
matics who were receiving 0.1 or 4 g of EPA daily for
8 weeks, and also found reduction in leukocyte arachi-
donic acid and LTB
4
and PGE
2
with the higher dose of
EPA. Although a variety of studies have documented
an effect of fish oil on leukotriene production in vivo
from inflammatory cells [6­8] our study is the first to
examine this issue in an epidemiologic context and find
a significant relationship between ordinary dietary fish
intake and level of pulmonary function.
We wish to stress some of the methodologic deficiencies
of our investigation. This investigation is a cross-sectional
study and thus cannot establish a temporal relation-
ship between fish intake and pulmonary function. In
addition, food frequency questionnaire data is inherently
variable [9]. Also, supplemental use of fish oil and other
dietary supplements were not examined. Finally, the
effects of medication use on our results cannot be asses-
sed. It is certainly possible that subjects who eat fish
on a regular basis are those who follow a more healthy
lifestyle and it is not the fish per se but some other dietary
component correlated with fish which is responsible for
these associations. However, further evaluation of fish
intake and its relationship to pulmonary function and
asthma symptoms in epidemiology would be worthwhile.
