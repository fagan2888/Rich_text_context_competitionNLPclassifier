Aims Prolonged sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed economies and is associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic
risk profile and premature mortality. This study examined the associations of objectively assessed sedentary time and
breaks (interruptions) in sedentary time with continuous cardio-metabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers, and
whether these associations varied by sex, age, and/or race/ethnicity.
Methods
and results
Cross-sectional analyses with 4757 participants (20 years) from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 US National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An Actigraph accelerometer was used to derive sedentary time [,100
counts per minute (cpm)] and breaks in sedentary time. Independent of potential confounders, including moder-
ate-to-vigorous exercise, detrimental linear associations (P for trends ,0.05) of sedentary time with waist circum-
ference, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-%B, and HOMA-%S were observed.
Independent of potential confounders and sedentary time, breaks were beneficially associated with waist circumfer-
ence and C-reactive protein (P for trends ,0.05). There was limited evidence of meaningful differences in associ-
ations with biomarkers by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Notable exceptions were sex-differences in the associations
of sedentary time and breaks with HDL-cholesterol, and race/ethnicity differences in the association of sedentary
time with waist circumference with associations detrimental in non-Hispanic whites, null in Mexican Americans,
and beneficial in non-Hispanic blacks.
Conclusion These are the first population-representative findings on the deleterious associations of prolonged sedentary time
with cardio-metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. The findings suggest that clinical communications and preventive
health messages on reducing and breaking up sedentary time may be beneficial for cardiovascular disease risk.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature
death in the USA and Europe.1,2 Elevated levels of cardio-
metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers have been associated
with increased risk of CVD and premature mortality, even at
levels below traditional cutpoints of categorically defined risk.3,4
Lack of regular exercise is an established modifiable risk factor
for these biomarkers as well as incident CVD and premature mor-
tality.5 More recently, time spent in self-reported sedentary behav-
iour has been recognized as a unique risk factor, with detrimental
associations observed with several of these outcomes.6 Both of
these behavioural risk factors are highly prevalent, with objective
measures revealing remarkably low levels of moderate­vigorous
exercise7 and high levels of sedentary time8 in adult populations.
Furthermore, they are independent of each other, with the
adverse influence of prolonged sedentary time being seen indepen-
dent of exercise,9,10 and in those who are physically active at or
above recommended levels.9 These findings are consistent with
the idea that sedentary behaviours have the potential to influence
risk of disease, independent of exercise participation.
To date, the majority of evidence on associations of sedentary
time with cardio-metabolic biomarkers has been derived from self-
report measures. Only three studies, from Europe and Australia,

have examined these associations using an objectively derived (via
accelerometers) measure of sedentary time.11 ­ 15 These studies,
less prone to the biases and errors of self-report, showed that
total sedentary time was detrimentally associated with waist cir-
cumference, triglycerides, 2 h plasma glucose,11,12 and insulin.13,14
However, these findings are limited by small sample size11,12,14,15
a focus on high-risk individuals,14 and have only evaluated white
adults of European descent.11 ­ 15 Given that variations in the exist-
ence or strength of the associations of self-reported sedentary
time with measures of cardio-metabolic health have been noted
(mostly by sex6 but also by race/ethnicity16), it is important to
establish (particularly in large, representative samples) whether
such differences exist for objectively derived sedentary time.
Furthermore, just as focusing exclusively on exercise time
ignores the substantial daily contribution of both light-intensity
incidental activity and sedentary time,12 focusing only on the
total time spent sedentary might overlook important issues, such
as how sedentary time is accumulated. An accelerometer-
measurement study of 168 Australian adults showed accruing
sedentary time in shorter periods (with more interruptions) to
be less detrimental for cardio-metabolic health than accruing
sedentary time in prolonged periods (with fewer interruptions).15
Here, breaks (interruptions) in sedentary time were beneficially
associated with adiposity, triglycerides, and 2 h plasma glucose,
independent of total sedentary and exercise time.15 No other
studies have explored this `breaks' hypothesis in relation to cardio-
metabolic biomarkers.
Given the comparative lack of information about the relation-
ships of sedentary time with cardio-metabolic and inflammatory
risk in non-white populations, and the need to confirm and
extend on earlier findings regarding breaks in sedentary time,
our aim was to examine the associations of accelerometer-derived
total sedentary time and breaks in sedentary time with cardio-
metabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers in a large, ethnically
diverse sample of US adults.
Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is
a cross-sectional study that uses a complex, multistage probability
design to obtain a representative sample of the USA civilian non-
institutionalized population. The methods are described in detail at:
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.17 The survey consists of a house-
hold interview and an examination conducted in a mobile examination
centre (MEC). For this study, data were drawn from the 2003/04 and
2005/06 NHANES cycles. For adults, response rates for the examin-
ation component were 69% in 2003/04 and 71% in 2005/06.17 The
study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, the National Center
for Health Statistics Ethics Review Board approved the protocols,
and written informed consent was obtained.
Study sample
From an initial sample size of 20 472, adult participants (20 years;
excluding those who were pregnant or taking insulin) who wore an
accelerometer were included in the present study (eligible sample:
7797). Those with missing values for outcome variables or covariates
or with insufficient valid accelerometer data were also excluded. Data
from 4757 adults were available for full analyses (full sample), with
sub-samples of 2118 available for fasting analyses (fasting sub-sample),
and 910 for 2 h plasma glucose analysis (oral glucose tolerance test:
OGTT sub-sample). Further details are provided in the Supplementary
material oline, Figure S1.
Accelerometer data collection and analysis
All ambulatory participants attending the MEC were eligible for the
accelerometer component (Actigraph 7164; Actigraph, LLC, Fort
Walton Beach, FLA).17 The Actigraph accelerometer is a small
(5.1 × 4.1 × 1.5 cm), lightweight (0.4 kg) instrument that records inte-
grated acceleration information as an activity count, which provides an
objective estimate of the intensity of bodily movement (particularly
ambulatory movement).8 As these activity counts are time and date
stamped, detailed data on the time, volume, and intensity of movement
can be derived. This differs from a pedometer, which only measures
the volume of movement. Lack of, or minimal movement recorded
by the accelerometer can be used to derive the time spent sedentary.
The accelerometer was worn on the right hip during waking hours
(except for water-based activities) for 7 days. Initial screening excluded
data from monitors not in calibration and data identified as question-
able at the download phase.17 An automated program (SAS 9.1: http://
riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/)8 was adapted and used to
implement quality control procedures, derive wear time, and summarize
minute-by-minute data. Non-wear time was defined as intervals of at
least 60 consecutive minutes of 0 cpm, with allowance for up to 2 min
of observations of some limited movement (,50 cpm) within these
periods. Days with at least 10 h of wear time that did not contain exces-
sively high counts (.20 000 cpm) were considered valid. To estimate a
longer-term pattern of sedentary time, only participants with at least
four valid days (10+ h of wear), including at least 1 weekend day,
were included in the analyses.
Accelerometer counts were used to classify all worn time as
either sedentary (,100 cpm),8,11 ­14 light-intensity activity (100­
1951 cpm), or moderate­vigorous intensity physical activity (exercise,
1952 cpm):18 the intensity level recommended for health in
current physical activity guidelines.5 Interruptions in sedentary time,
or a transition from a sedentary (,100 cpm) to an active state
(100 cpm), was considered a break.15 The number of breaks was
summed over valid days15 and the mean duration of breaks was calcu-
lated. Correction for the influence of variation in wear time on both
the sedentary (total and breaks) and exercise variables was achieved
by standardizing these values using the residuals obtained when regres-
sing the variables on wear time.19 To facilitate interpretation of the
clinical significance of the findings, sedentary time, breaks, and exercise
(corrected for wear time) were examined as quartiles. Light-intensity
time was not examined as it had an almost perfect inverse correlation
(Spearman's r ¼ 20.98) with sedentary time (corrected for wear) and
would have caused collinearity.
Cardio-metabolic outcomes
Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the level
of the iliac crest. Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were
measured three to four times with a mercury sphygmomanometer
by trained staff and are reported as averages (excluding the first
reading and questionable values).17 Non-fasting serum measures of
HDL-cholesterol were collected and analysed using the Roche/
Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics direct HDL method. Non-fasting
C-reactive protein concentrations were measured by latex-enhanced
nephelometry on a Behring Nephelometer.
Additionally, in a sub-sample of participants who attended the
morning examination (half of all sampled), fasting measures were
Sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers in US adults 591
obtained for triglycerides, plasma glucose, and insulin. There was no
exclusion for the fasting sample based on drug treatment, and no
specific instructions were given with respect to a drug washout
period for those in this portion of the study. Triglycerides were
measured enzymatically at both time points, using the Beckman
Synchron LX20 analyser in 2003/04 and the Hitachi 717/912 analysers
in 2005/06. Glucose was analysed using the hexokinase method, using
the Roche Cobas Mira analyser in 2003/04 and the Roche/Hitachi 911
analyser in 2005/06. Insulin was analysed via the Tosoh AIA-PACK IRI
immunoenzymometric assay in 2003/04 and the Merocodia Insulin
ELISA immunoassay in 2005/06. To account for differences in the
methods, we applied correction equations to the fasting plasma
glucose and insulin values, after truncating values to assay-specific
detectable ranges (to avoid negative estimates). These corrected
values were used in the Homeostatic Model Assessment to provide
measures of b-cell function (HOMA-%B) and insulin sensitivity
(HOMA-%S). Furthermore, all fasting participants in the 2005/06
survey underwent an OGTT from which 2 h plasma glucose values
were obtained. All outcomes were treated continuously, with
natural log transformation applied to non-normal distributions.
Covariates
Socio-demographics
Interviewer-administered questionnaires obtained socio-demographic
information. Age (years) at the time of the survey was treated continu-
ously, allowing for curvilinear relationships by also modelling
age-squared (where statistically significant). Categories of educational
attainment, marital status and poverty­income ratio, and self-reported
race/ethnicity were used, as listed in the Supplementary material
online, Table S1.
Behaviours
Smoking status was categorized according to serum-cotinine levels.
A single 24 h diet-recall coupled with US Department of Agriculture
food composition data measured intakes of total energy and saturated
fat (as a percentage of total energy) and alcohol. Additionally, potass-
ium, fibre, caffeine, and calcium intakes were considered with respect
to blood pressure. Dietary variables were examined as quintiles,
except for alcohol, which was collapsed into sex-specific categories
based on US Dietary guidelines.20
Medical history
Dichotomous variables were generated from self-reported medical
history for diabetes, CVD, and cancer and (for females only) use of
oral contraceptives, hormone replacement and post-menopausal
status. Current medication use was recorded, and coded according
to the Lexicon Plus (Cerner Multum Inc.) database.17
Statistical analysis
To obtain population-representative findings, linearized estimates with
weightings were computed in Stata v.11 (College Station, TX, Stata
Corporation). Two year sample weights for each NHANES cycle
were combined to provide 4 year weights for the 2003­06 survey
periods. Sub-sample weights were used for the fasting and OGTT out-
comes; all other analyses used examination weights that were
reweighted to account for the non-random absence of accelerometer
data.7 Statistical significance was set at P , 0.05 for main effects, and
P , 0.1 for interactions; tests were two-sided.
Linear regression analyses examined the associations of total seden-
tary time and breaks in sedentary time with cardio-metabolic out-
comes. Model 1 adjusted only for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Model
2 additionally adjusted for socio-demographic, behavioural, and
medical confounding factors that a backward elimination process had
previously identified as specifically relevant for each outcome (P ,
0.2 for retention: see Supplementary material online, Table S2) as
well as quartiles of exercise time. To examine the extent to which
central obesity may mediate the associations observed with other
cardio-metabolic outcomes, Model 3 further adjusted for waist
circumference. The associations for breaks were examined having
adjusted for sedentary time (quartiles). The findings from Model 2
are presented as the main results; the results from Model 1 and
Model 3 are reported in Supplementary material online, Table S4.
Results are reported as marginal means for each quartile of
exposure, back-transformed from the log scale for the non-normal
outcomes.
Interactions examined whether associations varied by sex, race/
ethnicity, or age (adjusting as per Model 2, but without weighting,
to avoid the problem of inflated standard errors). Race/ethnicity
comparisons excluded the `Other' race/ethnicity group, where
the small sample size precluded meaningful interpretation. Strati-
fied analyses differed from the main analyses in that they adjusted
for reproductive variables (in female only models, if P , 0.2); rou-
tinely adjusted for poverty­income ratio (all race/ethnicity
models); used collapsed sampling strata and response categories
for smoking and alcohol when required due to insufficient
numbers; and used sex-specific, race/ethnicity specific, or sex and
race/ethnicity specific quartiles as appropriate. Age interactions
were tested using continuous age, centred on the mean
(unweighted mean ¼ 53.0 years).
Results
The population-weighted socio-demographic and behavioural
characteristics of the sub-samples (fasting, OGTT) were similar
to the full sample and to all potentially eligible participants (see
Supplementary material online, Table S1). Furthermore, there
were minimal differences between those included in the samples
and the eligible (but excluded) participants in terms of their demo-
graphic characteristics and study outcomes. The average age of the
full sample was 46.5 years (SD 14.2), with 50% males. Acceler-
ometer wear time was 14.6 (SD 1.60) h/day (91.2 h total, SD
17.1), of which an average 8.44 (1.45) h/day was spent sedentary,
and a median 0.34 h/day (interquartile range 0.15, 0.61) was
spent in exercise. Sedentary time was broken up an average of
556 (SD 108) times across the entire wear time (92.5 times, SD
15.6 per valid day), with a mean break duration of 4.12 (SD
1.26) min.
Clear differences by sex and race/ethnicity in accelerometer and
cardio-metabolic characteristics were observed (see Supplemen-
tary material online, Table S3). Females were more sedentary,
but had more breaks and a more-favourable cardio-metabolic
profile than did males. Mexican Americans were the least
sedentary, but had significantly higher triglycerides than did non-
Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. In the full sample, exer-
cise had a moderate inverse correlation with sedentary time
(Spearman's r ¼ 20.57, P , 0.001) and a very weak correlation
with breaks (Spearman's r ¼ 0.03, P ¼ 0.04). Sedentary time
and breaks were weakly correlated overall (Pearson's r ¼ 20.25,
P , 0.001).

Overall associations of total sedentary
time and breaks with cardio-metabolic
risk biomarkers
Following adjustment for covariates, including exercise (Table 1),
there were significant detrimental, linear associations of total
sedentary time with waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, C-
reactive protein, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-%B, and
HOMA-%S. The magnitude of the average difference between
the top and bottom quartiles of sedentary time (a difference of
2.3 h), was clinically meaningful for triglycerides (0.26 mmol/L),
insulin (11.6 pmol/L), HOMA-%B (11.6%), and HOMA-%S (36%).3
Independent of total sedentary time (as well as exercise and
potential confounders), breaks in sedentary time were significantly
detrimentally associated with waist circumference, C-reactive
protein, and fasting plasma glucose (Table 1), although only the
first two were consistent, linear associations. The associations
with waist circumference were particularly strong and clinically rel-
evant. Here, Quartiles 2, 3, and 4 were all significantly different
from Quartile 1 (reference) and corresponded to, on average, a
2.4, 2.9, and 4.1 cm lower waist circumference, respectively.
Sex differences
Significant interactions (P , 0.1) between sedentary time and sex
were seen with blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides,
insulin, HOMA-%S, and HOMA-%B. For breaks, significant inter-
actions were seen with these same outcomes, except for
HOMA-%B, and also with 2 h plasma glucose. However,
HDL-cholesterol was the only outcome for which there was any
evidence that an association with sedentary time or breaks was
present for one sex but not the other (sedentary time in males;
breaks in females). Detailed results are available in Supplementary
material online, Table S5.
Racial/ethnic differences
Associations of total sedentary time with waist circumference, sys-
tolic blood pressure, insulin, HOMA-%B, and HOMA-%S differed
significantly by race/ethnicity (Figure 1A­E). The most marked
difference between the racial/ethnic groups was for waist circum-
ference, where sedentary time was detrimentally associated in
non-Hispanic whites only, with the association null for Mexican
Americans, and beneficial in non-Hispanic blacks. In contrast,
sedentary time had significant detrimental associations with
insulin, HOMA-%B, and HOMA-%S within all racial/ethnic
groups, with only the shape of the relationship differing. No associ-
ation between sedentary time and systolic blood pressure was
evident within any racial/ethnic group (despite the interaction).
With one exception, HDL-cholesterol (Figure 1F), associations of
breaks did not differ by race/ethnicity (P . 0.1). Breaks had a
linear, significant, beneficial association with HDL-cholesterol in
non-Hispanic whites but no association within both Mexican
Americans and non-Hispanic blacks. Detailed stratified results are
available in Supplementary material online, Table S6.
Age differences
We examined whether the differences in cardio-metabolic out-
comes between quartiles of sedentary time or breaks (relative to
the bottom quartile) varied with each additional year of age. Signifi-
cant interactions were observed for waist circumference (P ¼
0.002), HDL-cholesterol (P ¼ 0.037), and C-reactive protein
(P ¼ 0.005) for sedentary time, and systolic blood pressure (P ¼
0.005) for breaks. For each of these outcomes, the effect of seden-
tary time or breaks was the same in direction and significance as
was seen previously in the overall analysis (Table 1). Detailed
results are presented in the Supplementary material online,
Table S7.
Discussion
Prolonged sitting time is a common feature of contemporary
society.21 However, compared with other modifiable health beha-
viours, such as diet, smoking, and lack of exercise, the potential
health risks of this ubiquitous behaviour are relatively unknown.
This is the first study in a large, representative, multi-ethnic,
population-based sample to examine the associations of objec-
tively derived total sedentary time and breaks in sedentary time
with cardio-metabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers. Indepen-
dent of exercise time and other potential confounders, total
sedentary time was detrimentally associated with several bio-
markers, whereas breaks, independent of sedentary time, were
beneficially associated with waist circumference, C-reactive
protein, and fasting plasma glucose. These findings complement
and build upon previous results from smaller and/or less-diverse
populations and highlight the importance of considering prolonged
sedentary time as a distinct health risk behaviour that warrants
explicit advice in future public health guidelines.5 In particular,
the findings are likely to have implications for settings where pro-
longed sitting is widespread, such as office workplaces.
Our findings overall, and among non-Hispanic white participants,
were consistent with those observed among Australian and Euro-
pean adults;11 ­ 15 namely, the strongest associations with sedentary
time were observed for triglycerides and markers of insulin resist-
ance, rather than for blood pressure. This is consistent with plaus-
ible physiological mechanisms: fewer skeletal muscle contractions
may result in reduced lipoprotein lipase activity and clearance of
plasma triglycerides, reduced clearance of an oral glucose load
from plasma, and less glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.21 The
magnitude of the differences between the top and bottom quar-
tiles were clinically meaningful for triglycerides and insulin resist-
ance suggesting that, in theory, population wide reductions in
sedentary time (of a magnitude of 1­2 h per day) could have a
substantial impact on CVD prevention.22
This study also showed, for the first time, that sedentary time
was detrimentally associated with C-reactive protein, while
breaks were beneficially associated. Given that C-reactive
protein is an inflammatory marker associated with increased risk
of several major disease, including coronary heart disease and vas-
cular mortality,4 inflammation may be an adjunct pathway (along
with reduced muscular contractions) though which prolonged
sedentary time may impact on CVD risk. Furthermore, as the cor-
relation between sedentary time and light-intensity time was
almost perfectly inverse, findings could also reflect the benefits
of light-intensity activity.11,12

Figure 1 Associations of total sedentary time (A­E) and breaks in sedentary time (F) with cardio-metabolic biomarkers by race/ethnicity
(Model 2) in US adults 20 years (NHANES 2003­06). Only associations where a significant interaction (P , 0.1) was observed are
shown. *P , 0.05; **P , 0.01; ***P , 0.001 from Quartile 1 (reference). Quartile cutpoints for total sedentary time (hours/day) are: 7.39,
8.59, 9.72 for non-Hispanic whites (clear triangle), 6.20, 7.48, 8.85 for Mexican Americans (filled orange triangle), and 7.19, 8.49, 9.51 for non-
Hispanic blacks (clear blue square). Quartile cutpoints for breaks are: 472, 558, 645 for non-Hispanic whites, 478, 575, 649 for Mexican Amer-
icans, and 449, 545, 638 for non-Hispanic blacks. Sedentary variables standardized for wear time prior to categorization.
Sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers in US adults 595
A key contribution of this study is the confirmation and exten-
sion of our previous findings15 indicating that patterns of sedentary
time accumulation are important in addition to amount of seden-
tary time. This was particularly pertinent for waist circumference
where those in the top quartile of breaks had, on average, a
4.1 cm lower waist circumference than those in the lowest quartile.
Of importance to note is that a break could be as short as 1 min
and not necessarily entail `exercise', suggesting that regular breaks
from sedentary time are probably feasible in many contexts.
However, the measure of breaks is relatively unsophisticated: it
does not differentiate between breaks of a long and/or high
intensity, and those of a short, low intensity. More detailed exam-
ination of sedentary time patterns, as well as laboratory
experimental studies and real-world intervention trials examining
the effects of reducing and/or breaking up sedentary time, are
needed.
A unique element of this study was the examination of the
relationship of objectively derived sedentary time with cardio-
metabolic biomarkers by race/ethnicity. The patterning of findings
by race/ethnicity has some coherence with studies showing racial/
ethnic differences in the relationship of waist circumference with
visceral adiposity,23 the compensatory responses to insulin resist-
ance,24 lipoprotein responsiveness to exercise,25 and the relation-
ship between triglycerides and insulin resistance.26 For waist
circumference in particular, the racial/ethnic differences were
quite pronounced--with no evidence of a detrimental association
of sedentary time at all with Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic
blacks. Regardless of whether the racial/ethnic differences are bio-
logical, or due to unmeasured confounding factors, it is clear that
this field of research needs to expand beyond predominantly white
populations, to explore this heterogeneity and avoid potentially
inappropriate generalization of findings.
A strength of our study is the objective measurement of
exposure variables. Compared with self-report, objective
measures are more precise, less biased, and reduce the potential
for differential measurement errors. However, some error could
still be present. First, estimates depend heavily on wear time,
which was estimated rather than directly measured. Second, the
uniaxial accelerometer predominantly captures ambulatory activi-
ties and cannot distinguish between different postures or variations
in walking conditions. Thus, though the sedentary cutpoint
(,100 cpm) provides a useful estimate of sitting time,8 some
standing still time may also be included as sedentary time.
Although we controlled for confounding using several well-
measured relevant variables, including measures of health status,
residual confounding is possible. For example, adjustments were
not made for occupational characteristics (unavailable for the
2005/06 survey). This is unlikely to be an important issue, as a sen-
sitivity analysis of the 2003/04 data (not reported) adjusted for
employment status and work type, did not attenuate any of the
associations statistically or in terms of effect size; most interactions
were also unaffected. There may have been some selection bias as
we excluded a large proportion of participants, predominantly for
lacking sufficient accelerometer data to acquire habitual estimates
of sedentary time; however, this bias is likely to be minimal, par-
ticularly in view of the reweighting for accelerometer non-
response. Of importance to note is that these associations were
cross-sectional. Thus, reverse causation is a possibility, and causal-
ity cannot be determined.
In summary, these population-based findings provide further evi-
dence on the deleterious associations of sedentary time with
cardio-metabolic health in adults, and provide novel evidence on
the relationship of sedentary time with the inflammatory bio-
marker C-reactive protein. Furthermore, we found significant ben-
eficial associations of breaking up sedentary time with
cardio-metabolic health--particularly waist circumference--inde-
pendent of overall sedentary time. In general, these associations
were consistent across sex, age, and race/ethnicity subgroups. Pro-
longed sedentary time is likely to increase with future technological
and social innovations,21 and it is important to consider a whole of
day approach to physical activity promotion. Reducing and regu-
larly breaking up sedentary time may be an important adjunct
health message, alongside the well-established recommendation
for regular participation in exercise. While further evidence of a
causal nature is required from longitudinal and intervention
studies, less sitting time would be unlikely to do harm, and
would, at the very least, contribute to increase overall levels of
energy expenditure.
