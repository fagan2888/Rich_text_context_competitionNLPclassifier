Introduction
For centuries, the value of rhetoric has been vociferously
debated (Vickers, 1989). In Gorgias, Plato (ca. 380
b.c.e./1871) showed Socrates brilliantly using rhetoric to
debate Sophistic rhetoricians (Wardy, 1996). In his defini-
tion, Socrates shows his distrust of their persuasive discourse
as follows:
. . . rhetoric is of two sorts: one, which is mere flattery and
disgraceful declamation; the other, which is noble and aims at
the training and improvement of the souls of the citizens, and
strives to say what is best, whether welcome or unwelcome, to
the audience . . .
Then he asks, "but have you ever known such a rhetoric
. . . ?" (Plato, ca. 380 b.c.e./1871). This article is a response
to that question. It is a discussion of an exemplary rhetoric
that both ennobles and flatters audiences in the discourse of
environmental studies.
Examples of both kinds of rhetoric abound in works of
environmental sciences, literature, and criticism. One promi-
nent example is the emergence of the term sustainability
(Anholt, 2003; Cronon, 2013) as a replacement for terms
evoking imminent crises, such as Earth in the Balance (Gore,
1992). An Ngram (Figure 1) for sustainability shows a steep
climb since the 1970s, perhaps due in part to its Socratic
"noble aim," but also possibly its power to flatter audiences
that policies, practices, or products are sustainable (e.g., BP,
2013). Another example is growing rebranding of global
warming as climate change (Figure 2) following audience
responses to weather patterns (Conway, 2008). In these and
other examples, persuasive discourse leads to changes in
scholarly research, public policy, and cultural practices.
To ask a rhetorical question, how does persuasive dis-
course work? In seemingly small ways, ideas form, enter dis-
course, and reproduce in a vehicle that Dawkins (1989)
defined as a meme, "a unit of cultural transmission" (p. 192).
Long before, Hugo (1877) described the effects of persuasive
discourse as, "One resists the invasion of armies; one does not
resist the invasion of ideas" (Chapter X). In such cases, ideas
attached to discourse can conquer and occupy the world.
This essay examines one specific rhetorical device that
helped to spread an environmental idea throughout the world.
Aldo Leopold's (1949/2013) essay The Land Ethic (TLE) is
regarded as a seminal document in histories of environmen-
tal movements (Meine, 1988, 2004). The Ngram (Figure 3)
for the phrase, the land ethic, shows a steep upward curve
starting in the 1970s, long after its initial publication, as this
idea spread along with the expansion of environmental stud-
ies (Worster, 1994). Previous analyses of Leopold's rhetoric
(e.g., Willard, 2007) have looked at Leopold's writings as
through a telescope, showing the depth of his invention and
disposition. This analysis looks as through a microscope at
one technique of his elocution, evidently aimed at both flat-
tering and ennobling his audiences.
"That Imperial First Word"
TLE is about 6,650 words long, including its title and sec-
tion headings. This essay is focused on Leopold's usage of

On a Rhetorical Technique in Leopold's
The Land Ethic: "That Imperial First
Word"
Henry St. Maurice1
Abstract
Analysis of definite articles in Leopold's essay The Land Ethic found evidence of deliberate usage of a rhetorical device for
emphasis. The device, a type of definite article, is commonly used and usually abused. Leopold's uses evidently affected his
essay's contribution to environmental communications.

one of those words, the, a definite article that he uses 477
times in TLE. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) lists
23 various definitions of the, one of which is, " . . .
Referring to a term used generically or universally" (Item
II, Example 19). This study concentrates on Leopold's
usage of that specific meaning, making a simple
distinction among three types of usage, as per The Chicago
Manual of Style (16th ed.):
A definite article points to a definite object that (1) is so well
understood that it does not need description (e.g., "the package
is here" is a shortened form of "the package that you expected is
St. Maurice 3
here"); (2) is a thing that is about to be described (e.g., "the
sights of Chicago"); or (3) is important (e.g., "the grand prize").
Examples of these three usages are shown in Table 1, a
tabulation of the fourth paragraph of TLE, in a section headed
"The Ethical Sequence."
This essay will concentrate on usages categorized as Type
3 excluding some singular nouns (i.e., Plato's the soul). Most
Type 3 usages have grammatical and semantic alternatives.
For instance, Leopold's usage of the tendency could have
been tendencies, which would be more grammatically con-
sistent with two plural nouns that it precedes, individuals or
groups.
Among alternatives in English (Master, 1997), Leopold
chose a Type 3 definite article in titling his essay TLE as
would have been distinct from a land ethic or land ethics.
The former usage is an example of an indefinite article, and
the latter use is an example of a null article. A fourth type of
article is partitive, as in some land ethics.
The incidence of Leopold's usages of Type 3 definite arti-
cles in TLE is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Among 32 usages
counted as Type 3, Leopold uses the phrase the land ethic
only twice not counting the title; those usages are described
below. He uses 75% of these Type 3 articles in three of the
eight sections, as will also be discussed below after some
general points about their rhetorical functions.
For what rhetorical purposes does Leopold use these
words? It seems fair to infer that he is using definite articles
to claim universality, a well-known rhetorical technique.
Such claims are occasionally overstatements, known to rhet-
oricians as hyperbole, an example of which Mark Twain
(1907) colorfully described in his article on The First Church
of Christ, Scientist:
"THE" I uncover to that imperial word. . . . It lifts the Mother-
Church away up in the sky, and fellowships it with the rare and
select and exclusive little company of the THE's of deathless
glory--persons and things whereof history and the ages could
furnish only single examples, not two: the Saviour, the Virgin,
the Milky Way, the Bible, the Earth, the Equator, the Devil, the
Missing Link--and now The First Church, Scientist . . .
Twain found bombastic flattery in a usage that literally
uplifts an institution's name. In addition to such sublime con-
notations, definite articles can be used to connote solidity, as
Leopold does by invoking pyramids to describe invisible
ecological relations. This technique is called reification as
defined by Whitehead (1925/1997):
. . . a process of constructive abstraction [by which] we can
arrive at abstractions [through] simply located bits of material . . .
In short, using Type 3 definite articles can lend both uplift
and solidity to abstractions. This usage, however, entails
risks along with benefits of accessibility. Whitehead calls
one great risk "the fallacy of misplaced concreteness," mak-
ing false oversimplifications of complex abstractions.
Alexical authority in Leopold's time, Fowler (1926/1983)
inveighed against misuses of this type: " . . . inserting the
where it is indefensible, in the false belief that it is impres-
sive or literary . . . " (p. 642). For example, the land is often
invoked as a reified abstraction without reference to specific
places (Williams, 1985). Despite risks of illogical reifica-
tion, Type 3 definite articles derive rhetorical force by com-
bining specificity from Types 1 and 2 in a tactic that Burke
(1966) called a " . . . terministic screen . . . stretched to cover
not just its own special field but a more comprehensive
area" (p. 52).
In TLE, Leopold uses Type 3 definite articles for specific
purposes. First of all, he modulates them in alternating sec-
tions that have more frequent usage than sections in which he
uses few or even none (Figure 4).
Three sections of TLE were modified from articles pub-
lished in scholarly journals and had been edited for usage
according to various styles. Leopold revised them for this
essay (Meine, 1988). In the resulting sections that Meine
calls "the scientific backbone" of TLE occur the most fre-
quent usages of reified abstractions such as "the land" or "the
individual."
Leopold made special use of Type 3 definite articles in
two other sections. In the section headed "Land Health and
the A­B Cleavage," Leopold identified two types of conser-
vationists: One he called Group A, who use land for "com-
modity production" contrasted with Group B conservationists
who regard land "as a biota, and its function as something
broader." In the next section headed "The Outlook," Leopold
elevated Group B's ethics to higher status with a canny usage
of articles in his definition: "A thing is right when it tends to
preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic com-
munity. It is wrong when it tends otherwise" (at Word 6301,
emphasis added). He could have used " . . . a biotic commu-
nity" without diminishing the force of that statement, but he
used a Type 3 article to infer a universal idea that all living
things are joined.
In that concluding section of Leopold's last published
work, in what Meine (2004) called " . . . arguably the most
important sentence that Aldo Leopold ever wrote" (p. 210),
Leopold said, "I have purposely presented the land ethic as a

Type
The Ethical Sequence: This extension of ethics, so far
studied only by philosophers, is actually a process in
ecological evolution. Its sequence may be described
in ecological as well as in philosophic terms. An
ethic, ecologically, is a limitation on freedom of
action in the struggle for existence. An ethic,
philosophically, is a differentiation of social from
anti-social conduct. These are two definitions of
one thing. The thing has its origin in the tendency
of interdependent individuals or groups to evolve
modes of co-operation . . .

product of social evolution, because nothing so important as
an ethic is ever `written'" (1949/2013, p. 188, at Word 6442;
emphasis added). The next two uses of ethic are also modi-
fied indefinitely with an and any. What Leopold did in this
sentence and in the title of the essay was to promote without
lengthy argument his version of a land ethic--one of admit-
tedly two types--over all others, despite Fowler's admoni-
tion against indefensible logic. No less than THE First
Church, THE Land Ethic stakes a claim for universality. To
complete his peremptory elevation, Leopold repeats the title
with its definitive article for the second time about 200 words
from the end of the essay with a rhetorical technique known
as peroration (Lanham, 1991).
Upshots
The rhetoric of TLE was deployed to persuade a general
audience. Leopold was a prolific author who had published
many scientific articles, textbooks, and tracts on land use,
forestry, and wildlife. He was a recognized practitioner of
scientific rhetoric in which universal statements and affecta-
tions of impartiality are valued (Bazerman, 2000). He was
also a fecund writer of letters, journals, and phenological
data, who left a trove for scholars after his untimely death in
1948. In that same year, he crafted TLE with rhetoric admit-
tedly different from what he used for persuading professional
peers. He renders judgments and calls for actions. For
instance, he refers to the conservation movement as "the
embryo" (1949/2103, p. 172, at Word 457) for whom (at
Word 6645) "The case for a land ethic would appear hopeless
but for the minority which is in obvious revolt against these
St. Maurice 5
`modern' trends" (p. 188). He then appeals to the broadest
possible audience by evoking two universals: evolution and
religion (at Word 6464):
Only the most superficial student of history supposes that Moses
"wrote" the Decalogue; it evolved in the minds of a thinking
community, and Moses wrote a tentative summary of it for a
"seminar." I say tentative because evolution never stops (p. 188)
Leopold, a lover of music, here plays his prose instrument
fortissimo. In this passage, he aligns his land ethic with the
Mosaic Decalogue, further enshrining a biotic and ecological
land ethic as a version of the Golden Rule of universal moral-
ity (Stace, 1937/1990).
He also connects his land ethic to evolution, which he
cites in TLE 12 times as a noun or adjective and cites twice
in the paragraph beginning, "I have purposefully presented
the land ethic . . . " He is unswerving in his conviction that
evolution is a universal mechanism of natural, social, and
moral change. He nonetheless expressed doubt about future
changes.
TLE was published in a section "The Sand County
Almanac" that he had titled The Upshot using another Type 3
definite article. As Leopold well knew, the literal term
derives from a hunting shot taken in an up-range direction.
As the heading for TLE, it denotes uncertainty about what
lies ahead; it is repeated in the section titled with another
Type 3 definite article "The Outlook." He said, "Perhaps the
most serious obstacle impeding the evolution of a land ethic
is the fact that our educational and economic system is
headed away from, rather than toward, an intense conscious-
ness of land" (1949/2013, p. 187, at Word 5968). Weary from
war, plagued by illness, and disappointed that his colleagues
had not turned--as he had--away from exploiting natural
resources toward their stewardship, Leopold was not
optimistic.
He had been present at many changes, including forestry
and ecology as disciplines of applied science; conservation
policy at public and private agencies; and as a pioneer
researcher and developer of wildlife and soil and water man-
agement. He was an internationally renowned scholar whose
doubts set a tone for environmental communications in
decades to come, fusing rhetorics of science and morality to
skeptically describe present harms and warn of impending
dangers (AtKisson, 1999). Like Socrates, his skepticism
cohabited with his idealism.
Conclusion
TLE was published posthumously as an epilogue to the
descriptive prose of A Sand County Almanac and as a reflec-
tion following his observations of life on a small plot of land.
In this analysis, one small but important effect in TLE was
Leopold's deft usage of definite articles to confer universal-
ity on his proposed ethic. He eschewed fallacies or hyperbole
that have plagued rhetorics since Plato's time. Twain,
Whitehead, and Fowler warned that bombast can sprout in
the shade of a tiny word but withers under scrutiny. Rather
than that, TLE's survival and prosperity have contributed to
evolving rhetorics, policies, and practices in science, poli-
tics, and philosophy.
After two decades of neglect, TLE achieved much of its
author's purpose. By its fifth decade, it had influenced a host
of environmental activists who have affected environmental
policies and practices in deploying their own rhetoric com-
bining scientific rigor and spiritual fervor, as Leopold did.
Dyson (2008) observed,
There is a worldwide secular religion which we may call
environmentalism, holding that we are stewards of the earth,
that despoiling the planet with waste products of our luxurious
living is a sin, and that the path of righteousness is to live as
frugally as possible. . . . The worldwide community of
environmentalists - most of whom are not scientists--holds the
moral high ground, and is guiding human societies toward a
hopeful future. Environmentalism, as a religion of hope and
respect for nature, is here to stay
Whether or not environmentalism is a secular religion, its
alignment of practical wisdom and spiritual idealism does
seem to be implanted in public discourse. By now, the land
ethic is a phrase that meets all the criteria of a successful
meme, along with such others as sustainability or climate
change. In coining it, Leopold combined Sophistic flattery and
Socratic nobility in ways that have persuaded multitudes to
join his Group B among scientists, policymakers, and citizens
around the world. In Twain's words, the land ethic with its
"imperial first word" has indeed joined that "rare and select
and exclusive little company of the THEs of deathless glory".
