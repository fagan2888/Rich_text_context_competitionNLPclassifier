PEOPLE subjected to disadvantaged living conditions
live shorter, less healthy lives than those not so exposed
(Macintyre & Ellaway, 2003; Riva, Gauvin, & Barnett,
2007). The factors responsible for these relationships, how-
ever, remain unknown. Conceptual models are lacking, and
empirical studies are constrained by the dominance of
indicators of socioeconomic status, largely poverty rates.
Although there is evidence that associations between neigh-
borhood attributes and health are particularly strong among
adults of retirement age (Robert & Li, 2001), it is not clear
which neighborhood features are most likely to influence
health. The analyses that follow have three goals: (a) to de-
velop a multidimensional conceptual model of neighbor-
hood characteristics salient to the health of older people, (b)
to empirically test the robustness of the model using data
gathered from readily accessible secondary sources, and (c)
to relate population-level disability experienced by older
people to neighborhood characteristics.
Despite pleas encouraging investigators to hypothesize
about the features of place that influence health and the
mechanisms by which they do so (Curtis & Jones, 1998;
Diez-Roux, 1998; Macintyre, Maciver, & Sooman, 1993;
O'Campo, 2003), there has been little theory guiding neigh-
borhood analyses. This applies to the choice of variables
studied, definition of geographic areas, and interpretation
of findings (Mitchell, Gleave, Bartley, Wiggins, & Joshi,
2000). Because inductive logic and post hoc speculation
rather than deductive logic and theoretical propositions
have guided science (Frohlich et al., 2007), place has typi-
cally been relegated to the residual part of the "black box"
left once other variables are controlled (Macintyre, Ellaway, &
Cummins, 2002).
In conjunction with lack of theory, the proclivity to define
neighborhoods as a function of socioeconomic status has
limited understanding of the mechanisms by which neigh-
borhoods affect health. The almost exclusive reliance on
variables readily available in the U.S. Census, including
rates of poverty, economic deprivation, and education,
explains neither how nor why neighborhood influences
health. Moreover, the tendency for studies to operationalize
neighborhoods as a function of single variables has made it
virtually impossible to understand how one attribute relates
to another (Stafford et al., 2007). Although useful for
first-generation studies, these practices have hindered
"unpacking" the specific exposures and pathways through
which neighborhood disadvantage affects health (Kawachi &
Subramanian, 2007).
A Conceptual Framework of Neighborhoods
Speculation regarding the components of neighborhoods
likely to affect the health of older adults has centered pri-
marily on compositional and contextual factors (Cummins,
Macintyre, Davidson, & Ellaway, 2005, Curtis & Jones,
The Texture of Neighborhoods and Disability Among

Objectives. To present and test an ecological multidimensional model of neighborhood characteristics and examine its
relationship to older disability among older adults.
Method. Indicators of social vulnerability, wealth, violence, storefronts, residential stability, and the presence of phy-
sicians, supermarkets, and fast-food establishments for 1,644 of New Jersey's census tracts were derived from sources
that include the U.S. Census 2000, Uniform Crime Report for New Jersey, New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Divi-
sion of Marketing and Development, New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety Division of Alcohol Beverage
Control, and Health Resources and Services Administration Geospatial Data Warehouse. Confirmatory factor analyses
were used to develop and test a measurement model of neighborhood texture. Structural equation modeling examined the
relationships between neighborhood characteristics and disability of persons aged 65­69 years.
Results. Analyses revealed that distinct dimensions of neighborhoods could be modeled with administrative data and
that neighborhood contextual (supermarkets, physicians, storefronts, violence) and compositional (social vulnerability,
wealth, residential stability) characteristics were related to the prevalence of disability.
Discussion. The use of multiple indicators of neighborhood with good psychometric qualities is critical for advancing
knowledge about the mechanisms by which neighborhood characteristics are associated with the health of older people.

1998; Macintyre & Ellaway, 2003). Compositional charac-
teristics are the features of people living in a particular
locale (e.g., level of education, poverty, wealth); contextual
components are the built and nonbuilt aspects of a given
geographic area (e.g., amount of air pollution, number of
bars, libraries). Although debate regarding the saliency of
these effects has been heated (Macintyre et al., 1993;
Sloggett & Joshi, 1994), the multidimensional nature of
ecological effects has been acknowledged, and a push
toward understanding how features of place, separately, and
in conjunction with one another, influence health advanced.
Lacking, however, are comprehensive conceptual models
and empirical studies of how neighborhood characteristics
relate to one another and how they in turn come to influence
health.
Building on work by Bernard and colleagues (2007), we
conceptualize neighborhoods through the lens of differ-
ences in the distribution of resources. The concept of place
as a unique system of resources and social relationships
embedded within geographic borders was described by
Curtis and Jones (1998) and expanded by Macintyre and
colleagues (Macintyre & Ellaway, 2003; Macintyre et al.,
2002). Borrowing from these scholars, we posit that spatially
patterned health inequalities are rooted not only in resources
per se but also in an unequal distribution of positive and
negative resources. The presence of positive resources in a
neighborhood should promote health, whereas negative
resources should undermine it. We caution that although a
host of neighborhood characteristics can be identified, we
limited our conceptual thinking to those readily available in
existing secondary data sources.
We propose that positive contextual resources of neigh-
borhoods likely to promote the health of older adults
include the presence of supermarkets and the availability of
physicians. Supermarkets sell a wide variety of high-quality
products at low cost (Zenk et al., 2006), and studies have
consistently found that residents with better access to super-
markets have healthier food intake and less risk of obesity
(Larson, Story, & Nelson, 2009). Similarly, research has
indicated that physical proximity to physicians or medical
facilities is associated with utilization of healthcare resources
(Meade & Earickson, 2000).
In contrast, negative contextual resources including bars,
convenience stores, small groceries, fast-food restaurants,
and violent crime present significant health challenges.
Stockdale and colleagues (2007) demonstrated that alcohol
availability was associated with community disorder. Zenk
and colleagues (2006) observed that convenience stores and
small groceries or bodegas offer prepared, high-calorie
foods and little fresh produce at high prices, thereby pro-
moting poor health. Similarly, the presence of fast-food res-
taurants that sell food high in fat, sodium, and sugar is likely
to have a negative impact on health (Mehta & Chang, 2008;
Morland & Evenson, 2009; Morland, Wing, Diez-Roux, &
Poole, 2002). Neighborhoods characterized by high rates of
crime affect health by increasing the risk of victimization
and the perception of neighborhood danger (Stockdale
et al., 2007), which in turn may make people curtail outdoor
activities, thereby isolating themselves.
The contextual resources of place alone do not define
neighborhoods; rather the resources of a neighborhood are
also determined by the composition of the people who live
within them. Positively valenced composition resources
include affluence and high levels of residential stability,
whereas negatively valenced composition is evidenced by
high levels of social vulnerability.
There is consistent evidence that persons living in neigh-
borhoods characterized by high levels of social vulnera-
bility, including high rates of female-headed households,
households on public assistance, and unemployed men,
have poor health (Kawachi & Berkman, 2003; Yen,
Michael, & Perdue, 2009). Neighborhood affluence (higher
educational attainment, higher levels in earned income), on
the other hand, exposes residents to higher proportions of
neighbors who are likely to be well-educated and have the
economic resources to be health-savvy. Positing that neigh-
borhood affluence is more than merely the converse of
neighborhood disadvantage, Browning and Cagney (2003)
found that indicators of neighborhood affluence, but not
those representing neighborhood disadvantage, were signif-
icantly associated with health in the United States. Finally,
social disorganization theory suggests that residential sta-
bility fosters the development of trusting relationships and
strong ties with neighbors (Sampson, Morenoff, & Gannon-
Rowley, 2002; Stockdale et al., 2007).
Our conceptual model posits that the contextual and com-
positional resources of neighborhoods are related to one
another, both are important, and their association with
health is complex. For example, neighborhoods character-
ized by low socioeconomic status may also have higher
levels of air pollution exposure and higher mortality (Jerrett,
Buzzelli, Burnett, & DeLuca, 2005). These same neighbor-
hoods, however, may offer services not available elsewhere,
as some of the best-quality hospitals in Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, and Los Angeles are located in neighborhoods
characterized by poverty, small groceries, and violent crime.
This paper seeks to expand thinking about the specific, mea-
surable neighborhood characteristics that may be responsi-
ble for the consistent relationships that research has
identified between neighborhoods and health (Balfour &
Kaplan, 2002; Beard et al., 2009; Kawachi & Berkman,
2003). Although our model does not attempt to explain the
underlying rationale for why neighborhood characteristics
influence health, it does lay the critical groundwork for
conceptualizing neighborhoods as having complex textures,
moving science beyond its almost exclusive focus on
poverty.
In the analyses that follow, we use multiple indicators of
contextual and compositional resources to determine how
these aspects of neighborhoods relate to one another. We
NEIGHBORHOOD TEXTURE AND DISABILITY 91
posit that (a) the number of primary care physicians and the
number of specialists will be correlated and together will
represent the construct "availability of physicians"; (b) the
year the householder moved in and percentage of house-
holds having the same occupants for five or more years will
be correlated and together will represent the construct "res-
idential stability"; (c) The number of robberies, rapes, and
aggravated assaults in a tract will be correlated and together
will represent the construct "violence"; (d) The percentage
of female-headed households, households on public assis-
tance, and unemployed men will be correlated and together
will represent the construct "social vulnerability"; (e) The
percentage of persons with a college degree, percentage of
persons with a professional occupation, and number of
households having an income of $150,000 or more will be
correlated and will represent the construct "wealth"; and
(f) The number of bars/pubs, grocery stores, and convenience
stores in a tract will be correlated and together represent
the construct "Storefronts." In addition, we posit that these
characteristics as well as supermarkets and fast-food estab-
lishments (each single-item indicators) will have signifi-
cant, but moderate, correlations with one another.
The Relationship Between Neighborhoods and Disability
Studies examining neighborhood effects on disability
have found regional variation in late-life disability, with
persons in the South experiencing the highest disability
prevalence and those in the West the lowest (Lin, 2000).
Persons living in impoverished neighborhoods have higher
levels of disability than those living in privileged neighbor-
hoods (Balfour & Kaplan, 2002; Freedman, Grafova,
Schoeni, & Rogowski, 2008; Schootman et al., 2006; White
et al., 2010). Beard and colleagues (2009) found that resi-
dential instability and street characteristics (in addition to
low neighborhood socioeconomic status) were associated
with higher prevalence of physical disability.
Based on this literature, we hypothesize that neighbor-
hood characteristics will have differential associations
with disability. More specifically, we propose that contex-
tual influences such as supermarkets and physicians will be
associated with lower rates of disability, whereas neighbor-
hoods characterized by more storefronts, more fast-food
establishments, and higher levels of violence will have
higher levels of disability. Composition influences will also
be associated with disability, as disability will be higher in
neighborhoods characterized by social vulnerability and
lower in neighborhoods characterized by affluence and
residential stability.
Method
Although the overwhelming majority of studies examin-
ing the effects of neighborhoods on health have relied
almost exclusively on census data, our research pushes new
boundaries as we garnered data from multiple administra-
tive sources to characterize neighborhoods. Building on a
data panel of 5,688 people (ORANJ BOWL, Ongoing
Research on Aging in New Jersey: Better Opportunities for
Wellness in Life, Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, & Cartwright,
2010), the analyses focused on 1,644 of New Jersey's 1,912
census tracts in which participants lived. New Jersey census
tracts include an average of 428,774 residents (range
66,083­905,116). Although the analyses reported here do
not explicitly use data collected as part of the ORANJ
BOWL panel, we capitalized on the availability of detailed
census tract data for these geographic locations. As such,
the analyses reported here are ecological. Preliminary anal-
yses revealed that there were no significant differences
between the tracts included in our analyses and the totality
of New Jersey's tracts on any variable included in our
model, suggesting that our sample of tracts accurately rep-
resented the state of New Jersey.
Data Sources and Measures
Measures of residential stability, social vulnerability, and
wealth were from the 2000 U.S. Census. The Uniform
Crime Report prepared by the State of New Jersey, Division
of State Police Uniform Crime Reporting Unit for the year
ending December 31, 2006, was the source for crime data.
Information regarding the number of supermarkets, grocery
stores, local convenience stores, and fast-food restaurants
came from the New Jersey Department ofAgriculture, Divi-
sion of Marketing and Development, authorized by the Milk
Control Act State of New Jersey. We obtained a list of the
names of all 12,183 outlets with licenses to distribute milk
in New Jersey and following Morland and colleagues (2002)
used a modification of the 2007 North America Industry
Classification codes to categorize each establishment as
supermarket, grocery store, chain convenience store, local
convenience store, gasoline station with convenience store,
warehouse club, fruit and vegetable market, pharmacy, full
service restaurant, fast-food restaurant, and snack shop.
Interrater reliability of .85 was established and maintained
by three coders.
The number of bars and pubs in each tract were abstracted
from the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety
Division of Alcohol Beverage Control. We obtained a list of
the names and addresses of 9,261 establishments with alco-
hol retail licenses and coded each establishment as liquor
store, restaurant, bar/pub/tavern, motel/hotel, social club, or
combination bar­grill/restaurant­bar. Coders established
and maintained interrater reliability of .85. The number of
primary care physicians and the number of specialist physi-
cians in each zip code were downloaded from the Health
Resources and Services Administration Geospatial Data
Warehouse, 2006 edition (http://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/
HPSADownload.aspx, accessed Nov. 8, 2011). Although it
may be optimal to use indicators at a uniform level of geo-
graphic aggregation, research has shown little difference in

estimates when using zip code compared with tract-level
variables (Geronimus & Bound, 1998).
Table 1 provides information about the neighborhood
constructs and the variables used to represent each. Many
neighborhood characteristics are not evenly distributed in
the community causing the variables representing them to
likewise have uneven and wide-ranging distributions.
Recodes were used to reduce the impact of heterogeneity of
variances while still preserving substantive interpretability
of the variables.
Our index of disability, from the 2000 Census, repre-
sented the percentage of persons aged 65­69 years in each
census tract with a disability of any kind (sensory, physical,
mental, self-care, and those prohibiting a person from going
outside their home). We focused on this age band as it most
closely represents persons described by Robert and Li
(2001) likely to be affected by neighborhood characteristics.
Basing their work on that of Lawton (1977) and Lawton
and Nahemow (1973), Robert and Li suggest two possible
explanations for why environment may have its strongest
impact on people of this age: (a) the higher mobility in
younger people compared with older people exposes them
to a multitude of "suprapersonal environments" (work, home,
recreational activities); because older people spend more
time in their neighborhoods, the neighborhoods have the
potential to have greater effects on their behavior and (b) the
most demanding community environments are particularly
salient to people with compromised cognitive, psychological,
or physical competence. Census tracts varied in the percent-
age of persons with disabilities from 0 to 0.37 (M = 0.07,
SD = 0.04).
Analytic Strategies
An ecological study, the unit of analysis employed in all
analyses that follow was the census tract. In order to mini-
mize the likelihood of overfitting the model, the 3-phased
modeling procedures recommended by Horn and McArdle
(1980) were followed. The first two phases, model evalua-
tion and model readjustment, were carried out using a ran-
domly selected sample of 822 of the census tracts. Data
from the remaining 822 tracts were used for purposes of the
third phase of model testing, model replication. Consistent
with guidelines suggested by Gagne and Hancock (2006),
samples of this size enable model convergence and provide
the basis for accurately estimating parameters. Descriptive
data regarding the measures are presented for all tracts, as
t tests contrasting the samples revealed statistically signifi-
cant differences on only two variables that are, most likely,
a function of chance.
Confirmatory factor analyses with maximum likelihood
estimation used AMOS 18.0 inputting raw data using SPSS
(Version 18.0). Model fit was evaluated using the Tucker­
Lewis coefficient (TLI). The chi-square difference test com-
pared nested models in the exploratory phase (Byrne, 2001).

NEIGHBORHOOD TEXTURE AND DISABILITY 93
The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)
and Hoelter statistic served as indicators of the final model's
likelihood of replicating in additional samples (Byrne, 2001).
AMOS modification indices and inspection of loadings
guided changes to the model.
A multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
simultaneously tested the final model using data from
Samples 1 and 2. Analyses imposed sequentially more
stringent constraints on the equality of the model fit.
Following the procedures suggested by Brown (2006), the
following nested models were tested: (a) an unconstrained
model (two groups fitted separately, no equality constraints
imposed), (b) a measurement weights model (measurement
weights, regression weights, factor loadings constrained to
be equal), (c) a measurement intercept model (measure-
ment intercepts or means constrained to be equal), (d)
structural weight model, (e) structural covariance model
(covariances between latent constructs constrained to be
equal), (f) structural residual model (latent construct error
variances constrained to be equal), and (g) measurement
residual model (remaining error variances constrained to be
equal). Because of the large sample size, differences signifi-
cant at the P < .01 level were interpreted as significant.
Relationships between disability and neighborhood char-
acteristics were examined by adding covariances between
disability and each neighborhood construct to the measure-
ment model. These analyses were based on data from all
1,644 tracts and were developed using structural equation
modeling (AMOS 18.0).
Results
Table 2 includes bivariate correlations among all model
variables for Sample 1 (lower diagonal) and Sample 2
(upper diagonal). As expected, the correlations of variables
within factors were consistently higher than those between
factors (e.g., the correlations between the number of rapes,
robberies, and aggravated assaults and indicators of vio-
lence are higher than those between these variables and any
of the other model variables). The sole exception was the
relationship between variables representing social vulnera-
bility and wealth where the magnitude of inverse correla-
tions between factors was similar to that within each factor.
The hypothesized model yielded a very good fit (c2 =
411.74, df = 109, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.06 [90% confi-
dence interval = 0.05, 0.06] Hoelter = 292). The following
nonsignificant covariates were deleted from the model in
sequential order: (a) residential stability and fast food, (b)
residential stability and supermarkets, (c) social vulnerability
and availability of physicians, and (d) residential stability
and availability of physicians. Fit statistics of the final
model were as follows: c2 = 418.73, df = 113, TLI = 0.96,
RMSEA = 0.06; 90% confidence interval = 0.05, 0.06;
Hoelter = 296, suggesting that removing these paths did not
significantly alter the model fit.

Table 3. Parameter Estimates From the Final Model (N = 822, sample 1) (Continued)
Table 3 includes parameter estimates from the final mea-
surement model. The measurement model finds that the
standardized estimates of the indicators for each construct
(physician availability, residential stability, violence, social
vulnerability, wealth, and storefronts) had magnitudes of at
least .70, suggesting adequate representation of all con-
structs. The standardized covariance estimates (correla-
tions) among the constructs were all statistically significant,
ranging from -.14 (supermarkets and social vulnerability)
to -.88 (social vulnerability and wealth). The majority of
covariances ranged from .20 to .60.
Results from CFA analyses (available from the author)
indicated that measurement weights, intercepts, structural
means, structural covariances, and measurement residuals
for the two samples were not statistically different from one
another.
Fit statistics for the model adding disability (c2 = 678.763,
df = 122, p = .00, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.05 [90% confi-
dence interval = 0.05, 0.06] Hoelter = 391) demonstrated no
change in the parameters of the measurement model and
revealed that disability was significantly associated with
neighborhood characteristics. As depicted in Figure 1, con-
textual characteristics, including supermarkets and avail-
ability of physicians, were associated with lower levels of
disability, whereas storefronts and violence were associated
with higher levels of disability. There was no relationship
between fast-food establishments and disability. Composi-
tional characteristics were also related to disability, as social
vulnerability was associated with higher levels of disability,
whereas wealth and residential stability were associated
with lower levels of disability.
Discussion
Our analyses demonstrated that there are distinct compo-
sitional and contextual dimensions of neighborhoods that
can be modeled using data derived from a variety of readily
available databases and that these characteristics have dif-
ferential associations with disability. Building on work by
others (Bernard et al., 2007; Cummins et al., 2005; Frohlich
et al., 2007; Kershaw & Forer, 2010) who have advocated
using administrative data in conjunction with deductive theory,
our work suggests that creative use of these resources has
the potential to yield important new information.
The relationships among neighborhood attributes high-
light the complexities that characterize neighborhoods. The
very strong relationships between some of these constructs
(e.g., social vulnerability and wealth; violence and store-
fronts; social vulnerability and storefronts) raise questions
about whether these factors represent unique concepts or
PRUCHNO ET AL.
96
are better conceptualized as manifestations of a broader
metaconstruct. On the other hand, some of the more modest
relationships (e.g., supermarkets and violence, social vul-
nerability, wealth, storefronts; fast-food restaurants and vio-
lence, social vulnerability, wealth) highlight the importance
of measuring multidimensional aspects of neighborhoods in
order to understand them. In all, our findings suggest that
the compositional measures typically used to define neigh-
borhoods tell only part of the story and that to be fully
understood, neighborhoods should be defined and analyzed
using both compositional and contextual characteristics.
Our findings regarding the complex relationships
between neighborhood characteristics and disability are in
line with those reported by others (Balfour & Kaplan, 2002;
Beard et al., 2009; Freedman et al., 2008; Schootman et al.,
2006; White et al., 2010), yet add new information regard-
ing the characteristics of neighborhoods most likely to in-
fluence disability. Our findings speak to the differential
importance that contextual characteristics can have, as the
relationships between disability and both violence and
storefronts were much stronger than those between disabil-
ity and availability of physicians, supermarkets, and fast-
food restaurants. By acknowledging that neighborhoods can
be defined by a host of characteristics and identifying how
each of them differentially affect health, future research can
offer more useful opportunities for interventions and public
policy change.
As with all research, this study has its limitations. The
nature of the ecological secondary data available limited the
dimensions of neighborhoods that could be studied, and our
reliance on data from one state begs for future work in other
geographic locations. Defining neighborhoods based on
census tracts may not be optimal, as the boundaries of these
areas are typically unnoticed by its residents. Future studies
having access to specific information regarding the spatial
coordinates of neighborhood amenities will provide critical
information. The advent of sophisticated technologies such
as geographic information systems (Cromley & McLafferty,
2002) and hierarchical geostatistical modeling (Chaix et al.,
2006) that rely less on artificially imposed neighborhood
boundaries and take into account characteristics of proxi-
mate neighborhoods provides even greater preciseness to
the developing science relating place to health. Although
evidence exists that the data we used were reliable and
valid, they were collected for purposes other than research;
hence, some caution regarding their accuracy is suggested.
Moreover, our analyses, including some variables in num-
ber format and others in proportion format raise questions
Figure 1. Correlations between neighborhood characteristics and disability (N = 1,644; *p = .05, **p = .01)
NEIGHBORHOOD TEXTURE AND DISABILITY 97
regarding the influence of tract size. Future studies using
standardized data will help alleviate these concerns.
There are also important limitations regarding our analy-
ses of the relationship between neighborhood characteristics
and disability. As the data we analyzed are cross-sectional,
we cannot address the issue of causality. Future studies with
the ability to analyze both people and neighborhoods over
time are needed. Caution is in order regarding the indicator
of disability used in these analyses. As a heterogeneous
measure, it included home-bound persons, potentially con-
founding our analyses which presume exposure to outdoor
contextual factors. Moreover, findings regarding the rela-
tionship between neighborhood characteristics and disabil-
ity may not be generalizable to other age groups. Studies
examining the extent to which different age groups are
influenced by neighborhood characteristics and those exam-
ining different dimensions of both physical and mental
health will help to target limited health care resources.
Although our conceptual model broadens the definition
of neighborhood, it does not, by any means, fully define it.
Conceptually, we limited attention to constructs with mea-
sures that are widely available in secondary sources. As
such, we were able to provide new information about how
what neighborhood texture includes and how it relates to a
single dimension of health. Research focusing on other
objective resources (e.g., existence of parks, schools, public
transportation, adequate street lighting, walkable sidewalks,
and presence of pollution) as well as subjective resources
that require assessments by individuals living in neighbor-
hoods (e.g., perceived safety, social cohesion, and social
capital; Weden, Carpiano, & Robert, 2008) complementing
the characteristics included in our model is needed to foster
a more comprehensive understanding of the salient dimen-
sions of neighborhoods and the mechanisms by which
neighborhoods influence health. We hope that our work
encourages others to use existing administrative data to better
understand the textures of the neighborhoods that they
study. Similarly, although our analyses focused on the main
effects of neighborhoods on disability, future work examin-
ing the interactive neighborhood effects will be important.
Mujahid, Diex-Roux, Morenoff, and Raghunathan (2007,
p. 866) suggested that "the assessment of ecological
settings remains in its infancy." Improving the validity and
reliability of measures of neighborhood characteristics
using strategies such as those described here is a critical
first step.
