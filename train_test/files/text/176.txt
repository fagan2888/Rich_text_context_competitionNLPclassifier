Background. The purpose of the study was to estimate the prevalence of sociodemographic, health behavior, chronic
disease, and impairment factors and their impact on difficulty in lower body function among two age-cohorts (51-61 and
71-81 years) of Mexican Americans, African Americans, and Whites.
Methods. Reports from 8,727 and 4,510 self-respondents of the 1992 baseline Health and Retirement Survey and the
1993 baseline Assets and Health Dynamics Study, respectively, were used to estimate prevalence. Multiple linear
regression of the 4-item lower body difficulty scale (alpha = .80) was used to estimate the direct effects of the risk factors
within the age-cohort and ethnicity groups.
Results.. Overall, the risk factors are more prevalent among both minority groups and the older age-cohort. Lower body
deficits are particularly high among Mexican Americans and the younger age-cohort of African Americans. The impact of
risk factors does not vary much by ethnicity or age-cohort. Female gender, pain, arthritis, and heart and lung disease are
the major risk factors, and they account for about one-third of the variance in lower body difficulty for each group.
Conclusions. Efforts to prevent or reduce lower body difficulty should pay particular attention to pain, arthritis, and
heart and lung disease. The central role of sociodemographic and behavioral factors in chronic disease argues for their
continued inclusion in disability modeling and prevention.
IMPROVING the health and functional status of minority
racial and ethnic populations depends on the identification
of modifiable risk factors and their prevalence, as well as a
greater understanding of the outcome-specific impacts of
these risk factors (1). For the two largest minority ethnic
populations, Mexican Americans and African Americans,
three conditions have constrained efforts to establish the
prevalence and impact of such risk factors. First, datasets
with adequate samples of older African Americans and/or
Mexican Americans, and information on modifiable risk
factors (e.g., behaviors and diseases) and functional status,
have been relatively rare. Second, generalizations from the
limited data that do exist are tenuous because the prevalence
and impact of risk factors within minority ethnic populations
vary by age-cohort (1). And third, the majority of studies
that have addressed the prevalence or impact of risk factors
among older African Americans or Mexican Americans
have been limited to ADL-based indicators of functional
status (2-6).
This latter problem warrants further discussion because it
has broad implications for modeling functional status. Fig-
ure 1 shows a model of the relative location of ceiling effects
for self-report and performance-based measures of func-
tional status. Although we have drawn upon recent theoreti-
cal and empirical studies (7-11) in the development of this
model, the location of ceiling effects for the various types of
measures is speculative. For simplicity, consider functional
status as a continuum ranging from poor to excellent. Basic
activities of daily living (ADL) measures, whether perfor-
mance-based or self-report, only identify a small percentage
of community-dwelling adults near the poor end of the
continuum. For them the optimal time for the prevention of
overall functional decline may have passed. By comparison,
instrumental ADL measures are capable of capturing per-
sons who are farther removed from the poor end of the
continuum, but still fall well short of being identified at the
early stages of the disability process. In contrast, lower body
measures are capable of capturing functional difficulty well
prior to ADL disability (7,12). Because performance-based
assessments of lower body function (i.e., strength, stamina,
and balance) are relatively more precise than performance-
based assessments of ADLs or IADLS, the distance on the
continuum between lower body self-report and perfor-
mance-based assessments is greater than that between ADL
or IADL self-report and performance-based assessments.
Importantly, self-reports of lower body function are highly
correlated with performance-based assessments (13), and
lower body function is possibly the most influential dimen-
sion of functional status (7,8,12).
In the following sections we estimate and compare the
prevalence of risk factors for lower body difficulty among
one sample of Mexican Americans (n = 506), African
Americans (n = 1,590), and Whites (6,631) aged 51 to 61,
and another sample of Mexican Americans (n = 140),

African Americans (n = 603), and Whites (n = 3,767) aged
71 to 81. The data for the younger age-cohort are from the
1992 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) baseline inter-
views, and the data for the older age-cohort are from the
1993 Asset and Health Dynamics Study (AHEAD) baseline
interviews. In addition to comparing the prevalence of so-
ciodemographic, health behavior, chronic disease, and
physical and cognitive impairment risk factors, the associa-
tions of these factors with self-reported difficulty in lower
body functional status are compared across the age-cohort
and ethnic groups.
METHODS
Data. -- The 1992 HRS and the AHEAD were conducted
by the Institute for Survey Research (ISR) at the University
of Michigan for the National Institute on Aging. Seventy
thousand households obtained through an area probability
sample were screened for age-eligible persons (51 to 61
years old for the HRS, and 70 years or older for the
AHEAD). All age-eligible persons residing in the household
were selected for the HRS. In the AHEAD, if more than one
age-eligible individual was residing in the household, one
individual was randomly selected. In both the HRS and the
AHEAD, spouses were interviewed regardless of age.
Census tracts containing a high density of African Ameri-
cans or Mexican Americans were oversampled 2:1 in the
HRS and 1.8:1 in the AHEAD. All households within the
high-density census tracts that were identified as having an
age-eligible respondent were selected, except in the HRS,
where only households with an age-eligible Mexican Ameri-
can resident were selected from the high-density Mexican
American census tracts. Finally, one-half of the AHEAD
respondents who were aged 80 years and older were iden-
tified using the Master Enrollment File maintained by the
Health Care Financing Administration.
Response rates were approximately 80% for the AHEAD
and 82% for the HRS. Interviews lasted an average of one
hour per respondent. Our analyses were restricted to self-
respondents because of the subjective nature of many of the
measures. The overall proxy response rates were 5% in the
HRS and 10% in the AHEAD. Mean lower body scores (see
below) did not differ for self- and proxy respondents in the
HRS, but were 1.12 and 1.98 for self- and proxy respon-
dents, respectively, in the AHEAD. A previous report
showed that analyses restricted to Mexican American, Afri-
can American, and White self-respondents in the AHEAD
were not biased from those including proxy respondents
(12). There are 506 Mexican American (25 excluded prox-
ies), 1,590 African American (78 proxies), and 6,631 White
(332 proxies) self-respondents in the HRS. There are 140
Mexican American (33 proxies), 603 African American (86
proxies), and 3,767 White (291 proxies) self-respondents in
the AHEAD.
Measures. -- Our selection of independent variables was
guided in part by recent conceptual models of disability
(8,11,14,15). These models postulate that sociodemo-
graphic characteristics affect the practice of health behav-
iors, the prevalence of chronic disease and physical and
cognitive impairments, and, finally, difficulty in lower body
function. The practice of health behaviors affects the preva-
lence of chronic disease, impairment, and lower body dif-
ficulty. Chronic disease affects impairments and lower body
function, and, finally, impairments affect lower body func-
tion. Factors that are hypothesized to have an association
with lower body function in these conceptual models, or that
have been shown in existing empirical reports to have an
association, and that were available in both the HRS and
AHEAD, were included as independent variables in the
analyses. Additionally, sociodemographic factors that differ
markedly across age-cohort or ethnicity groups (e.g., region
of residence and marital status) were included as indepen-
dent variables in the analyses.
Following the causal sequence of the model, measures of
sociodemographic characteristics are presented and dis-
cussed first, followed by health behaviors, chronic disease,
physical and cognitive impairments, and lower body func-
tion. Many of the coding schemes are evident in Table 1 and
are not detailed here. The sociodemographic measures in-
clude age, gender, Southern geographic residence, propor-
tion of life spent in the U.S., language of interview, marital
status, working status over the past two years, education,
household income, and net worth. With the use of bracketing
techniques, income and net worth data were ascertained for
approximately 80 to 85% in both surveys. ISR-imputed
values were used for missing income and net worth data.
Because income and net worth were dichotomized at
$10,000 or less for this article (representing the approximate
yearly earnings from one full-time, minimum wage job), the
implications of imputation are minimized.
Health behaviors are reflected by sets of dummy variables
for the percent of ideal body mass (underweight [90% or
less], normal, and obese [140% or more]), smoking status
(current, former, or never), and a dichotomous indicator for
one or more alcoholic drinks per day. Markers for high blood
pressure, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart problems, and
stroke were based on positive responses to the question,
"Has a doctor ever told you that you have/had . . . ?"
Indications of arthritis or rheumatism were based on positive
responses to the question, "During the last 12 months, have
you seen a doctor specifically for arthritis or rheumatism?"
Psychiatric problems were based on positive responses to the
question,' 'Have you had any emotional, nervous, or psychi-
atric problems over the past 12 months?" Diabetes or high
LOWER BODY, AGE, AND ETHNICITY M99
blood sugar was captured by positive responses to the ques-
tion, "Do you have diabetes now?" Because these disease
indicators rely on health care provider contact, they are
generally specific, but not sensitive.
Physical and cognitive impairments are measured several
ways. Vision and hearing are self-rated with the use of
glasses, contacts, or hearing aids, with responses dichoto-
mized to fair/poor vs all other. Self-reported memory is
similarly coded. Immediate word recall score (percent cor-
rect out of 10 [AHEAD] or 20 [HRS]) provides a more
objective test of memory. Pain was captured through posi-
tive responses to the question, "Are you often troubled with
pain?" Experimental studies demonstrate that such self-
reports of pain are reliable (16).
The dependent variable, lower body difficulty, is the sum
of scores from four items: walking several blocks, climbing
one flight of stairs, pulling or pushing heavy objects, and
carrying 10 pounds. These items have been shown to form a
unidimensional scale that has racially and ethnically invari-
ant measurement properties in the AHEAD (12), the Longi-
tudinal Study of Aging (17), and the National Long-Term
Care Survey (18). The stem for these items in the HRS is
"How difficult is it for you to . . . ?" Responses of a little,
some, or a lot of difficulty, or that the respondent couldn't or
doesn't do any particular item were coded one, with all other
responses coded zero. The stem for these items in the
AHEAD is, "Do you have any difficulty . . . ?" Responses
of yes, don't do, and can't do were coded one. Cronbach's
alpha for the scale ranged from .79 to .83 for each of the
ethnic by age-cohort groups.
Analyses. -- Sociodemographic characteristics are pre-
sented first, followed by the prevalence of health behaviors,
chronic disease, physical and cognitive impairments, and
lower body difficulty among Mexican Americans, African
Americans, and Whites for each age cohort. The results of
multiple linear regression of the sociodemographic charac-
teristics, health behaviors, chronic disease, and physical and
cognitive impairments on lower body function are then
reported for each age-cohort by ethnic group. Statistically
significant differences between the partial regression coef-
ficients of the age-cohort by ethnicity groups are determined
using /-tests. Standard errors for the compared coefficients
are pooled and weighted by sample size (19). To adjust for
multiple hypothesis testing and to focus on substantive
significance, only statistically significant differences where
the confidence intervals of the two coefficients do not over-
lap are discussed.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the prevalence of risk factors for each
age-cohort by ethnicity group, with statistically significant
differences identified in the three right-hand columns. The
ethnic comparisons within the younger age-cohort are con-
sidered first, followed by the ethnic comparisons within the
older age cohort, concluding with the age-cohort compari-
sons within each ethnic group.
Ethnicity differences within the 51- to 61-year-old age-
cohort. -- In the younger cohort, African Americans were
nearly twice as likely as Mexican Americans or Whites to
have been widowed or divorced. Low income and net worth
were approximately three times more prevalent among Afri-
can and Mexican Americans compared to Whites. Educa-
tional attainment and having private health insurance were
highest for Whites and lowest for Mexican Americans.
African Americans were most likely to be current smokers,
but Whites were more likely to be former smokers. Mexican
and African Americans were substantially more likely to be
obese than Whites.
Significant differences in the prevalence of most diseases
were apparent. African Americans report the highest preva-
lence of high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis,
but Whites report having more cancer and chronic lung
disease. With the possible exception of diabetes, the preva-
lence of chronic disease does not appear high for Mexican
Americans relative to Whites. Nonetheless, Mexican Ameri-
cans report impairments (e.g., having fair or poor eyesight,

hearing, and memory, and being frequently troubled with
pain) much more frequently than African Americans or
Whites. Mexican and African Americans have poorer imme-
diate word recall and lower body function scores than
Whites.
Ethnicity differences within the 71- to 81-year-old age-
cohort. -- Similar ethnic differences were found in the older
age-cohort. African Americans experienced widowhood the
most, but were only more likely than Whites to have experi-
enced divorce. Mexican Americans were three times more
likely than Whites to have low income and net worth, while
African Americans were more than twice as likely as Whites
to have low income or net worth. Mexican Americans had the
lowest educational attainment, and Whites had the highest.
Being on Medicaid was much more common among Mexican
and African Americans than among Whites. The reverse was
true for having private insurance. Whites were least likely to
be obese, and most likely to be underweight. Whites were also
most likely to have one or more drinks per day.
With regard to disease and impairment, Whites were least
likely to report having diabetes or arthritis, but most likely to
report having cancer. African Americans were most likely to
report having high blood pressure, while Mexican Americans
were most likely to report having had emotional, nervous, or
psychiatric problems. Reports of having fair or poor eyesight,
hearing, and memory, and trouble with pain, were more
common among Mexican Americans than Whites, and, with
the exception of eyesight, than African Americans as well.
Whites reported better perceived eyesight and memory, and
immediate word recall than either Mexican or African Ameri-
cans. Whites also reported better lower body function, while
Mexican Americans reported the worst.
Age-cohorts within ethnicity. -- Widowhood rates were
higher among the older age-cohort, but divorce rates were
lower. Labor force participation was also lower among the
older age-cohort. The older age-cohort had at least twice the
rate of low income, and the same or lower rate of low net
worth. Educational attainment was also lower within the
older age-cohort, and the percent on Medicaid was substan-
tially greater.
Obesity was considerably less frequent in the older age-
cohort for African Americans and Whites, and the rate of
current smoking and alcohol use was less frequent in the
older age-cohort for all three ethnic groups. Excluding
psychological problems and arthritis, diseases were gener-
ally more prevalent within the older age-cohorts. With the
exception of pain, all impairments were more common in the
older age-cohort of each ethnic group. Lower body function
is worse in the older age-cohort for Mexican Americans and
Whites, but not African Americans.

cohort by ethnic group. The far right columns show the t-

LOWER BODY, AGE, AND ETHNICITY M103
African Americans and Whites can be directly compared
within age-cohorts. The Mexican American model can not
be directly compared to the African American or White
models because the relatively small sample size among the
older Mexican American age-cohort posed a degrees of
freedom constraint. This was resolved by first estimating
step-wise regression models for Mexican Americans, and
including in the final common Mexican American model any
risk factors significant for either Mexican American age-
cohort.
Regression analysis among Mexican Americans. -- Being
female, on Medicaid, and often troubled with pain are
positively associated with lower body difficulty in both
Mexican American age-cohorts. For the older age-cohort,
the only additional significant risk factor was having been
interviewed in Spanish. For the younger age-cohort, being
widowed or divorced, having lung disease, heart disease,
arthritis, and reporting fair or poor eyesight and memory are
also positively associated with lower body difficulty. Al-
though some of the parameter estimates for the Mexican
American age-cohorts are statistically significantly differ-
ent, all of their confidence intervals overlap (i.e., meet our
conservative test of equivalence).
Regression analysis among African Americans. -- It is
apparent that being female, having low income, being on
Medicaid, having diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis,
trouble with pain, and fair or poor self-rated memory are all
positively associated with lower body difficulty for both
African American age-cohorts. No additional effects are
significant in the older age-cohort. For the younger age-
cohort, however, current smoking, lung disease, psycholog-
ical problems, and fair or poor eyesight are also positively
associated with lower body difficulty. Again, although some
of the parameter estimates for the African American age-
cohorts are statistically significantly different, all of their
confidence intervals overlap.
Regression analysis among Whites. -- Numerous signi-
ficant associations emerge because of the large sample sizes
of Whites. Therefore, we restrict the discussion to associa-
tions that are significant at the .01 level or beyond, and
where confidence intervals do not overlap. Greater age,
being female, having low net worth, obesity, currently
smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, lung dis-
ease, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, fair or poor eyesight,
trouble with pain, and fair or poor perceived memory were
all positively associated with lower body difficulty in both
age-cohorts. For the older age-cohort, the only additional
associations (inverse) involved having worked in the past 2
years and immediate word recall score. For the younger age-
cohort, additional positive associations involved low in-
come, being on Medicaid, and having psychological prob-
lems, while having private insurance was negatively
associated with lower body difficulty. The confidence inter-
vals for the parameter estimates for working, private health
insurance, arthritis, and trouble with pain do not overlap.
Private health insurance and pain had stronger associations
for the younger age-cohort, while working in the past 2 years
and having arthritis had stronger associations for the older
age-cohort.
African American vs White comparisons. -- All of the
confidence intervals for the parameter estimates overlap in
the younger age-cohort. For the older age-cohort, even
though immediate word recall was not significant among
African Americans, the negative association of immediate
word recall with lower body difficulty was sufficiently
strong among Whites that the confidence intervals did not
overlap.
DISCUSSION
Before a general discussion of the findings, it is necessary
to highlight a couple of limitations to the data and analyses
reported here. First, because several of the independent
variables used in these analyses are not available for respon-
dents who required a proxy, it is not possible to demonstrate
that the type and impact of risk factors is consistent for self-
and proxy respondents. Thus, our findings apply only to
self-respondents. Second, although the few existing assess-
ments of the validity of self-reports of disease have not found
racial differences (20,21), the majority of the HRS and
AHEAD questions about disease rely on a doctor having told
the respondent that he or she has the disease. Thus, the
prevalence of chronic disease may be underestimated among
the younger age-cohort of Mexican and African Americans
who have lower rates of insurance coverage. The relatively
high proportion of Mexican and African American respon-
dents with less than $10,000 in income suggests that, in the
absence of insurance, access would be anything but routine.
Moreover, for Mexican Americans, chronic disease may be
underreported due to the prevalence of monolingual immi-
grants (46% and 74% in the younger and older age-cohorts,
respectively). The Spanish translation of the protocol is
accurate, but it does not address the problem that when
monolingual adults visit a physician, a third party is gener-
ally necessary for translation. The substantial import of the
Spanish-interview indicator for lower body difficulty scores
in the older age-cohort of Mexican Americans is suggestive
of reporting differences, but could also represent unmea-
sured cultural factors (e.g., diet). A similar association
between language of interview and health has recently been
reported among Mexican American children (22).
Consistent with other reports (1), functional status does not
vary much by age-cohort among African Americans. This is
not true for Whites or Mexican Americans, where the older
age-cohort has substantially poorer functional status. We also
found considerable racial and age-cohort differences in the
prevalence of sociodemographic, behavioral, chronic disease,
and impairment risk factors for lower body difficulty. How-
ever, few substantial age-cohort or ethnicity differences in the
risk factor estimates were found. Indeed, of 136 pairs of
regression coefficients, the confidence intervals of all but five
overlapped. Four of those that did not overlap involved
Whites, where the sample sizes were very large. Therefore,
age-cohort and ethnicity differences in lower body function do
not appear to result from differences in either the type or
impact of risk factors. Whether the differential prevalence of
risk factors accounts for ethnicity differences in lower body
M104 CLARK ETAL.
function is an important issue, but one that we have not
specifically addressed here. Previous reports have indicated
that a majority of the African American disadvantage in
disability can generally be accounted for by differences in the
prevalence of poverty and low education (23). In pooled,
hierarchical analyses not shown, we also found that lower
rates of family income, net worth, and years of education
accounted for the majority of Mexican and African American
disadvantages in lower body function.
Standardized regression coefficients (not shown) indicate
that the risk factors with the strongest and most consistent
associations with lower body function across the age-cohort
and ethnicity groups are: being female; having arthritis,
heart disease, or lung disease; and being bothered by pain.
Previous studies have also found these five variables to be
among the central risk factors of lower body disability
(8,24-26). In analyses not shown, these five variables ac-
counted for at least three-fourths of the variance explained
by the lower body function models of Table 2, with pain
having the greatest effect. Both arthritis and pain are com-
mon complaints among all age-cohort and ethnicity groups
(see Table 1), but are particularly common among Mexican
and African Americans, who have substantially lower levels
of educational attainment. Ironically, the vast majority of
extant research on the management of arthritic mechanics
and pain has been carried out on well-educated Whites (27).
Thus, arthritis self-help materials and classes (28) have been
geared to the least needy population: well-educated Whites.
Accordingly, a thorough review of cultural and educational
differences and their implications for the treatment and
management of arthritic mechanics and pain is warranted.
The fact that medical conditions and pain have the largest
association with lower body disability should not detract
from interest in the social and behavioral factors that precede
medical conditions and impairment in conceptual models of
disability. While the sociodemographic and behavioral risk
factors do not appear to have substantial proximal effects on
disability, their proximal effects on chronic disease are well
established (29). Regular physical activity, for example, has
been shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease
within one year of adoption (30), and has been shown to be
an effective approach to maintaining joint function and
managing pain among arthritic older adults (26). With re-
sponsibility for 80 to 90% of lung, and 20 to 30% of heart
disease, smoking cessation also represents an indirect path to
the prevention of lower body difficulty. Because risk-
reduction is closely associated with total years smoked and
years since quitting, this may be a more powerful prevention
tool in younger age-cohorts (31). Chronic disease and dis-
ability prevention will require a focus on not just behavioral
factors, but behavioral factors in social and cultural contexts
(32). Thus, the continued inclusion of sociodemographic
and behavioral risk factors in empirical and certainly con-
ceptual models of disability is not only appropriate, but
critical to disability prevention.
