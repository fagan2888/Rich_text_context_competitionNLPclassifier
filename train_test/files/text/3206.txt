Abstract
I introduce a novel, hierarchical model of tail dependent asset returns which can be partic-
ularly useful for measuring portfolio credit risk within the structural framework. To allow
for a stronger dependence within sub-portfolios than between them, I utilise the concept of
nested Archimedean copulas, but modify the nesting procedure to ensure the compatibility
of copula generators by construction. This makes sampling straightforward. Moreover, I pro-
vide details on a particular specification based on a gamma mixture of powers. This model
allows for lower tail dependence, resulting in a more conservative credit risk assessment than
a comparable Gaussian model. I illustrate the extent of model risk when calculating VaR or
Expected Shortfall for a credit portfolio.

Non-technical summary
There is a growing consensus among researchers, practitioners and regulators that Gaussian
models of asset returns lead to a systematic underestimation of tail risk when applied to a
credit portfolio or portfolio credit derivatives. This is due to the fact that such models cannot
properly account for the tendency of large negative asset returns to occur simultaneously ­
the property of the joint distribution of asset returns called in statistical terms lower tail
dependence. Therefore, the probability of joint default events and, in turn, extreme portfolio
losses is underestimated. It follows that an extensive utilisation of Gaussian models in risk
management can be seen as one of the determinants of a massive capital shortfall in the
financial sector during the recent crisis. To address this issue, I elaborate a novel model of
tail dependent asset returns exploiting the concept of nested Archimedean copulas.
The modelling approach presented in this paper has a number of technical merits which
provide it with a beneficial flexibility. I specify two dependence levels ­ sub-portfolios and the
whole portfolio ­ although the model can be extended to incorporate more than two levels.
This hierarchial dependence structure allows for a stronger dependence within appropriately
specified sub-portfolios (e.g. comprising obligors from a particular industry sector) than
between them. This is a desirable property because companies in the same sector usually
exhibit stronger dependence. The degree of dependence between the companies operating
in different industry sectors is, however, lower but not zero because of the influence of a
common macroeconomic environment. The model is also flexible enough for differentiated
treatment of different sub-portfolios, making it possible to cope with concentration risk.
Another advantage is that I avoid by construction built-in parameter restrictions which are
otherwise common in the specification of nested Archimedean copulas.
From a computational point of view, the model benefits from a straightforward sampling
procedure involving only uniformly and gamma distributed variables. The corresponding
pseudo-random number generators are, in fact, standard in mathematical and statistical
packages.
Apart from the technical features described, the suggested model could have implications
for risk controlling and banking regulation and, on a large scale, for financial stability. Because
this model takes account of the tail dependence of asset returns, its implementation would
result in a more conservative assessment of portfolio credit risk and, consequently, higher
economic and regulatory capital requirements. Therefore, the model is able to counter the
systematic underestimation of credit risk in the banking sector ­ one of the basic causes of
the recent financial turmoil.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Sowohl im akademischen Bereich als auch unter den Fachleuten der Finanzbranche und
Regulierern wird vermehrt die Meinung vertreten, dass die auf Normalverteilungsannah-
men beruhenden Modelle sich nicht zur Risikomessung von Kreditportfolien oder portfo-
liobasierten Kreditderivaten eignen. Solche Modelle ber¨
ucksichtigen ausschließlich lineare
Korrelationen zwischen den Firmenwerten der Schuldner. Sie sind nicht in der Lage, die
tendenziell gemeinsam auftretenden extremen Firmenwertverluste mehrerer Schuldner zu
erkl¨
aren, die zur H¨
aufung von Kreditausf¨
allen in einem Portfolio f¨
uhren ("lower tail de-
pendence"). Wenn die Wahrscheinlichkeit gemeinsamer Kreditausf¨
alle untersch¨
atzt wird, so
wird auch das Risiko unerwartet hoher Portfolioverluste und der korrespondierende Kapitalbe-
darf untersch¨
atzt. Daher kann eine verbreitete Anwendung von Kreditportfoliomodellen mit
gemeinsam normalverteilten Risikofaktoren als einer der Gr¨
unde f¨
ur die massive Kapitalun-
terdeckung w¨
ahrend der j¨
ungsten Finanzkrise identifiziert werden. Im vorliegenden Papier
wird ein stochastisches Modell f¨
ur Firmenwertrenditen vorgestellt, das die Abh¨
angigkeit der
unteren Verteilungsflanken ber¨
ucksichtigt. Das Modell basiert auf dem Konzept verschachtel-
ter Archimedischer Copulas.
Der hier vorgestellte Ansatz weist eine Reihe technischer Vorteile auf, die dem Modell einer-
seits Flexibilit¨
at verleihen und andererseits seine Umsetzung erleichtern. Ich spezifiziere zwei
Abh¨
angigkeitsebenen: die untere Subportfolio-Ebene und die obere Portfolioebene. Diese hi-
erarchische Abh¨
angigkeitsstruktur hat den Vorteil, dass die Firmenwertrenditen von Schuld-
nern, die ein und demselben Subportfolio zugewiesen sind, st¨
arker voneinander abh¨
angen
als die Firmenwertrenditen von Schuldnern aus unterschiedlichen Subportfolien. Wenn die
Subportfolien zum Beispiel nach Industriesektoren gebildet werden, so ist f¨
ur die im gleichen

ist die gegenseitige Abh¨
angigkeit von Unternehmen aus verschiedenen Sektoren schw¨

weil sie nur auf das gemeinsame makro¨

ist flexibel genug, um sektorale Unterschiede in der St¨

A Hierarchical Archimedean Copula
for Portfolio Credit Risk Modelling1
1. Introduction
Interdependent default events, when defaults of different counterparties tend to occur simul-
taneously, pose major challenges for an adequate assessment of credit risk in banks' lending
portfolios. A prerequisite for estimation of the associated extreme losses is, therefore, a
portfolio model capable of capturing dependence between rare events. Under the structural
approach for credit risk modelling, a firm's failure results from the asset value of the firm
falling below the value of its outstanding debt. Due to this direct link between the default
and asset value of a firm, interdependent default events can be modelled based on the joint
distribution of asset values or, equivalently, asset returns. Consequently, the tail dependence
properties of the joint distribution of asset returns would determine how frequently low-
probability events, such as the simultaneous defaults of several obligors, can actually occur.
This would eventually affect the amount of portfolio unexpected loss and the capital buffer
required as protection against losses.
The above chain of reasoning demonstrates that using portfolio credit risk models with
incorporated tail dependence can be crucial for a single bank's ability to remain solvent as
well as for the sustainability of an entire banking sector. In spite of that, Gaussian dependence
structures have been widely used by practitioners and regulators. Owing to a zero lower tail
dependence coefficient, a Gaussian model generates joint defaults far too infrequently, leading
to a systematic underestimation of portfolio credit risk and capital requirements and, in turn,
endangering banks' solvency.
To address this issue, I put forward a novel model of asset returns which can be used for
assessing portfolio credit risk under the structural approach. This model utilises the concept
of nested Archimedean copulas.
Archimedean copulas have been actively used in the portfolio risk modelling literature
because they possess a simple explicit representation which can be easily extended to an
arbitrary number of dimensions. An important feature of various Archimedean copulas is
that they allow for tail dependence which does not have to be symmetric. A drawback,
however, is the copula's invariance with respect to permutations of its arguments. The latter

feature is likely to be far too restrictive in a portfolio context, but can be overcome by a
nesting procedure, as utilised in this paper.
The nested Archimedean copula described in this paper has two major advantages in terms
of portfolio credit risk modelling: the lower tail dependence and the hierarchical dependence
structure. The first feature takes account of clustering default events. The latter allows for
stronger default dependence within appropriately specified sub-portfolios (e.g. comprising
obligors from a particular industry sector) than between them.2 It is a desirable property
because companies in the same sector usually exhibit stronger dependence. The degree of
dependence between the companies operating in different industry sectors is, however, lower
but not zero because of the influence of the common macroeconomic environment. The
magnitude of dependence parameters can also vary from one sub-portfolio to another so that
the model can cope with concentration risk.
Regarding related literature, I refer to Embrechts et al. (2003), McNeil (2008) and Hofert
and Scherer (2011) for more information on Archimedean copulas, nesting procedures and
compatibility conditions as well as on using nested copulas for credit risk assessment. In
the paper at hand, I modify the nesting procedure in a way which ensures by construction
the compatibility of copula generators and removes the usual restrictions on copula parame-
ters. From a computational point of view, this redefined nesting procedure makes sampling
straightforward. The work presented in this paper was part of my doctoral thesis published
in (Puzanova, 2010). In parallel to that work Hering et al. (2010) developed a probabilistic
model for construction nested Archimedean copulas using L´
evy subordinators. I refer to the
latter paper for more general theoretical results on the redefined nesting procedure.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 outlines the credit portfolio
setting used in the paper. Section 3 presents the hierarchical Archimedean copula model.
In section 4, I apply this model to two hypothetical test portfolios in order to judge the
model risk compared with a benchmark Gaussian specification. Finally, I summarise the
main results and draw conclusions in section 5.
2. Portfolio setting
I first define target variables which quantify credit risk at the portfolio level. In the tradition
of the default-only credit risk models, I look at the distribution of the potential portfolio
losses at a one-year risk horizon, whereby the losses can only materialise when one or more
borrowers go bankrupt. The portfolio loss, denoted PL, is a random variable which can be
defined as the sum over the individual losses Li
on every single exposure in the portfolio
(one borrower - one exposure). A loss variable Li
equals zero when the ith borrower survives
2I specify two dependence levels ­ sub-portfolios and the whole portfolio ­ although the model can be
extended to incorporate more than two levels.

beyond the risk horizon. Otherwise, when the borrower defaults on its obligations, Li
equals
the expected amount of loss given default LGDi
, i.e., the exposure to this borrower minus
the expected recovery. For the sake of convenience, I normalise the maximum total loss to
unity so that an individual LGDi
is given as a percentage of the total portfolio LGD.
The event of a borrower i's default is determined in the tradition of structural credit risk
models by the standardised returns on the borrower's market value of asset Ri
dropping below
the default threshold defined by the borrower's one-year probability of default PDi
. The
default threshold equals F-1
Ri
(PDi
), F-1
Ri
being the quantile function of the random variable
Ri
. The portfolio setting can be summarised as follows:
PL :=

where 1
1A
(X) denotes an indicator function:
1
1A
(X) =



1 for X  A,
0 otherwise.
With regard to the distribution of the portfolio loss variable PL, I am looking for the
Value at Risk at a pre-specified confidence level q (V aRq
) and for the Expected Shortfall
(ESq
). VaR is commonly used in risk management and controlling as a measure of portfolio
credit risk, although it is incoherent (not sub-additive in general). It quantifies the minimum
portfolio loss in the worst (1 - q) × 100 per cent of cases. V aRq
(PL) equals the value of the
quantile function of the random variable PL:
V aRq
(PL) := F-1
PL
(q) (2.2)
ES is a coherent risk measure which quantifies the expected portfolio loss in the worst (1-q)×
100 per cent of cases. ESq
(PL) equals the conditional tail expectation beyond the q-quantile
of the portfolio loss distribution augmented by a discontinuity adjustment:

3. The hierarchical Archimedean copula model
In this section, I derive a probabilistic model for asset returns utilising nested Archimedean
copulas. I also give details on a particular specification based on a two-fold Gamma mixture
of powers. I specify the hierarchical dependence structure in subsection 3.1 and investigate
its properties in subsection 3.2. Subsequently, I provide an appropriate sampling algorithm
in subsection 3.3.

3.1. Derivation of the copula
The portfolio dependence structure should be flexible enough to cope with sub-portfolios
which exhibit different dependence properties. Within the scope of Archimedean copulas,
this aim can be achieved by utilising a nesting procedure so that the resulting hierarchcal
Archimedean copula (HAC) would have the following general form
Cp Csp1 u11
, . . . , u1n1
, . . . , Cspm um1
, . . . , umnm
.
This is a copula model with two hierarchy levels. The copulas Cspj with j = 1, . . . , m at
the lower level of the hierarchy represent dependence functions of distinct groups of obligors.
There are m such groups or sub-portfolios each containing nj
obligors with m
j=1
nj
= n.
Those copulas specify the within-group dependence properties. At the top, portfolio level
of the hierarchy, the copula Cp joins the sub-portfolios. This copula determines dependence
properties between distinct groups of obligors. The copula argument uji
is defined in terms
of the probability-integral transform uji
:= FRji
(Rji
= xji
) for the asset return of the obligor
i in the sub-portfolio j.
The model should meet the following general requirements. For the purpose of portfolio
risk modeling, it is crucial that the copula allows for lower tail dependence. Moreover, the
between-group dependence should logically be less strong than the within-group dependence.
For the sake of flexibility, the nesting procedure should not pose any technical restrictions on
the parameters of the copulas Cspj .
According to Joe (1997, p. 86 ff.), an Archimedean copula arises from a mixture of powers.
The corresponding representation for the joint cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the
asset return vector R is given by:

(zp
).
Zp
is the positive mixing variable at the portfolio level. Its cdf is denoted by MZp
. Zspj
represents a sub-portfolio-specific positive mixing variable, which depends by construction on
Zp
. The cdf of Zspj
conditional on Zp
is denoted by MZspm
|Zp
.
If, for instance, the sub-portfolios represent the different industry sectors that the borrowing
companies are operating in, the economic interpretation of the mixing variables could be
as follows: Zspj
represents all the market and macroeconomic information relevant for the
companies operating in sector j. This information is partly sector-specific3 and not relevant
for other sectors. However, in part, it is common for all sectors, such as information about

later in this text.

the general economic environment. This part of the information is represented by the random
variable Zp
.
The two-fold mixture given in (3.1) determines the dependence structure of the asset return
vector. The asset returns are mixtures of powers with mixing variables Zspj
. Thus, conditional
on a realisation of Zspj
, j = 1, . . . , m, the returns are mutually independent. The sector-
specific random variables Zspj
are themselves mixtures with the common mixing variable Zp
.
Thus, conditional on a realisation of Zp
, the asset returns of the obligors in the different
sub-portfolios are independent, but those in the same sub-portfolio are not.
Because in the credit portfolio context only the dependence structure (i.e. copula) of the
asset return vector is of interest, we do not have to specify the cdfs Gji
exactly. Suffice it
to say that, according to Marshall and Olkin (1988), cdfs Gji
as implicitly defined by (3.1)
always exist.4
The HAC corresponding to the mixture representation (3.1) has the form:
Cp Csp1 u11
, . . . , u1n1
, . . . , Cspm um1
, . . . , umnm
= p

) + . . . (3.2)
+ -1
p
 spm
-1
spm
(um1
) + · · · + -1
spm
(umnm
) .
Here, -1
p
serves as the generator of the outer copula Cp and -1
spj
serves as the generator of
an inner copula Cspj .
Appendix A provides details on the HAC derivation from the general mixture of powers.
In this section, I derive a particular HAC model by defining all M(·)
in (3.1) as gamma cdfs.
This leads to a relatively simple copula function with lower tail dependence. However, it
might be an interesting topic for further research to use other positive mixing variables and
to compare the dependence properties of the resulting models. Another possible extension is
to define more than two hierarchy levels.
Because I specify all mixing distributions in (3.1) as gamma cdfs, I only need to know the
Laplace transform (LT) of a gamma random variable in order to derive an explicit formula
for the HAC in (3.2). First, I identify the inverse outer generater p
as the LT of the gamma
variable Zp with mean 1 and variance p
:
p
() = 1 + p
-1/p . (3.3)
Second, I identify the inverse inner generator spj
as the LT of the random variable Zspj
.
4These cdfs are given by Gji
(xji
) = exp --1
spj
FRji
(xji
) , where spj
denotes the Laplace transform of
Zspj
. In general, the Laplace transform of a positive random variable X is given by  = E exp{-X} =
exp - with  denoting the corresponding Laplace exponent.
5
Since the conditional distribution of this random variable is the gamma cdf MZspm
|Zp
and
the unconditional distribution is a mixture over MZspm
|Zp
with the mixing variable also being
gamma-distributed, I refer to the unconditional distribution of Zspj
as Compound Gamma
(CG). It is the distribution of a gamma subordinator, say Yspj
, evaluated at a random, gamma-
distributed time given by Zp
. The gamma random variable Yspj
has mean 1, variance spj
and LT
Yspj
= 1 + spj
-1/spj . (3.4)
According to Sato (1999, p. 201), I can derive the LT of Zspj
as follows:
spj
() = p
- ln Yspj
= 1 +
p
spj
ln 1 +  spj
-1/p
. (3.5)
Finally, I check that function (3.2) with p
and spj
defined in (3.3) and (3.5) is a proper
copula. This is only the case when the compound function
w() := -1
p
 spj
() (3.6)
satisfies the nesting condition of being in the class L
n
. This class of functions is specified by
Joe (1997, p. 88 f.) as:
L
n
= f : [0, )  [0, ) | f(0) = 0, f() = , (-1)k-1f(k)  0, k = 1, . . . , n .
Because a L´
evy subordinator evaluated at a random time given by another L´
evy subordinator
is also a L´
evy subordinator, the copula generators involved are compatible with each other
by construction. The compound function w() is just the Laplace exponent of a L´
evy sub-
ordinator and, thus, belongs to class L
n
(see Hering et al., 2010, Theorem 2.3). This result
can also be verified by looking at the derivatives of w  - ln Yspj
which are given by
w(k)() = (-1)k-1(k - 1)!k-1
spj
1 + spj
-k
for k  N.
The equation above implies that (-1)k-1w(k) > 0   N holds.
The explicit representation of the HAC, obtained from (3.2) by putting in (3.3) and (3.5),
is given by:
Cp Csp1 u11

, . . . , Cspm um1

. (3.7)
This nested portfolio copula produces two interesting special cases of marginal copulas.
6
The first special case is the nj

I term this Archimedean copula compound gamma due to the fact that the inverse generator
of the copula is the LT of a CG random variable. The second special case is the copula of
asset returns assigned to different sub-portfolios:
Cp(u1i

, (3.9)
which turns out to be a Cook-Johnson copula (or Clayton copula in a two-dimensional case).
It is worth to mention that the nesting procedure put forward in this subsection is different
from the commonly used one. For instance, Embrechts et al. (2003) and McNeil (2008)
among others suggest, first, to take some known generator functions, nest them as in (3.2)
and, second, to proof, whether the inner generators are compatible with the outer generater
and, if so, under which parameter restrictions. Apart from the initial uncertainty as to
whether the resulting function will be a proper copula or not and the parameter restrictions
that must be satisfied, this common procedure makes implementation difficult. In fact, we
either do not know the conditional distribution of Zspj
at all or this distribution is difficult
to sample from. By contrast, I use a nesting procedure which, on the one hand, ensures that
the compound function (3.6) is actually in L
n
without any parameter restrictions. On the
other hand, I am free to choose a distribution for the conditional random variable Zspj
| Zp
which is easy to sample from. This feature is especially favorable with regard to the model's
implementation. In the particular example elaborated in this subsection the random variable
Zspj
conditional on a realisation Zp
= zp
is gamma-distributed with mean zp
, variance zp
spj
and the following LT:
exp -zp-1
p
 spj
() = zp
Yspj
() = 1 + spj
-zp/spj . (3.10)
3.2. Properties of the copula
Concerning its algebraic properties, the hierarchical Archimedean copula (3.7) is only par-
tially exchangeable in its arguments whereby the marginal copulas (3.8) and (3.9) are fully
permutation-symmetric in their arguments.
7
Regarding their dependence properties, all Archimedean copulas (ordinary or nested) are
larger than the independence copula in the sense of concordance ordering.5 It means that the
random variables involved are positively dependent.
Moreover, it is ensured by construction that dependence within sub-portfolios is stronger
that dependence between them. According to corollary 4.4.4 in Nelsen (1999, p. 110), the
inner copulas are then larger than the outer copula (in the sense of concordance ordering) if
the compound function w defined in (3.6) is concave. w is given by w = - ln Yspj
which is
the Laplace exponent of the random variable Yspj
and, thus, a concave function so that the
required condition holds.
It follows from the above result that Kendall's tau and other measures of concordance,
defined in Nelsen (1999, p. 136f.), are greater for the inner copulas than for the outer copula.
It holds:
p

.
The outer Cook-Johnson copula is positively ordered, that is it exhibits stronger dependence
for larger parameter values p
, as shown in Nelsen (1999, p. 111) for the two-dimensional
case. For a fixed value of the parameter p
, the inner CG copula is also positively ordered
with respect to sp
. To show that for the two-dimensional case, I use the corollary 4.4.6 in
Nelsen (1999, p. 111). According to that corollary, if -1
sp1
/ -1
sp2
is nondecreasing on
(0, 1) for a fixed p
, then Csp1  Csp2 . The derivative of the inverse function of the CG LT
is given by
-1
spj
() = --p-1 exp
spj
p
-p - 1 .
It follows that
-1
sp1
()
-1
sp2
()
= exp

-sp2
.
This function is nondecreasing for a negative power, that is for sp1
< sp2
. It follows, that
for a fixed value of p
the CG family is positively ordered with respect to the parameter sp
.
To illustrate dependence properties implied by the HAC model and to attain some feeling
for the parameter sensitivity, I use information provided by contour and scatter plots for the
two-dimensional inner (CG) and outer (Clayton) copulas.
Because of the positive dependence, the contour lines of the copulas under consideration lie
between those of the independence copula and those of the maximum copula (the copula of
comonotone random variables): cf. Figure 1. Figure 2 illustrates that the magnitude of the
positive dependence is the greater, the larger the variance of the mixing variables: the contour
lines converge to those of the maximum copula. For a particular value of p
, dependence is
stronger in the case of the CG copula (i.e. within a sub-portfolio) than for the Clayton

With regard to the lower tail dependence, we can clearly see clusters of low-probability
realisations in the lower left-hand corners of a unit square in Figure 3. These scatter plots were
obtained by simulation using the algorithm provided in the next subsection. The magnitude
of lower tail dependence increases with rising values of variance parameters. Again, the sub-
portfolio-specific parameter sp
has an amplifying effect so that the tail dependence within a
sub-portfolio is stronger then the tail dependence between asset returns of obligors belonging
to different sub-portfolios. A stronger within-sector dependence of the large negative asset
returns can also be inferred from the pairwise scatter plots in Figure 4. The figure shows
realisations from a four-dimensional Archimedean copula with two hierarchy levels and two
sub-portfolios.
The property of lower (upper) tail dependence of two random variables describes the prob-
ability that extremely small (large) realisation of both variables occur simultaneously. The
general and Archimedean-copula-specific lower and upper tail dependence coefficients are
given as (cf. Joe, 1997, p. 103):

.
The lower tail dependence coefficient for the two-dimensional outer (Clayton) copula is
given by L
= 2-1/p so that lower tail dependence is increasing in the parameter. For the
two-dimensional inner (CG) copula, no explicit expression can be obtained L
. But, because
of the result Cp  Csp, it holds that L
is greater for the inner copula that for the outer
copula (cf. Hering et al., 2010). Moreover, because for a given value of p
the CG family
is positively ordered with respect to sp
, the lower tail dependence within a sub-portfolio is
stronger for rising values of sp
.
Regarding the upper tail dependence, it is pointed out by Hering et al. (2010) that if both
mixing variables used in the mixture of powers have finite mean, then there is no upper tail
dependence between and within sub-portfolios.
I illustrate the parameter sensitivity of the tail dependence by means of a graphic represen-
tation in Figure 5. For u  0 the coefficients converge to values greater than zero indicating
positive lower tail dependence. It is greater for the CG copula. For u  1 the upper tail
dependence coefficients converge to zero for both Clayton and CG copulas regardless of the
magnitude of the variance parameters.

3.3. Sampling algorithm
I will conclude this section by providing a sampling algorithm for the hierarchical Archimedean
copula defined in (3.7). It goes as follows:
· Generate Zp
from the gamma distribution with mean 1 and variance p
.
· Generate Zspj
| Zp
, j = 1, . . . , m from the independent gamma distributions with mean
Zp
and variance Zp
· spj
.
· Generate variables Xji
, j = 1, . . . , m, i = 1, . . . , nj
from the uniform distribution on the
interval [0, 1].
· The realisations from the HAC are given by
Uji
= p



-
ln Zp
Yspj
- ln Xji
/(Zspj
| Zp
)
Zp



.
The sampling is particularly easy because we know by construction the distribution of the
conditional random variable Zspj
| Zp
: see (3.10). It was not the case in other papers on
nested Archimedean copulas, which I have mentioned in the introductory section.
Having elaborated the theoretical background, I move to an application example in the
next section.

4. Application to test portfolios
In order to judge the model risk which arises from neglecting tail dependence in a credit
portfolio context, I apply the HAC model introduced in the previous section to two test
portfolios and compare the results with the outcomes of a Gaussian model. I describe two
test portfolios in subsection 4.1. In subsection 4.2, I calibrate the parameters of the HAC
and the benchmark Gaussian model. The final results are discussed in subsection 4.3.
4.1. Test portfolios
The stylised portfolios used in this section are adopt from Puzanova et al. (2009). The smaller
portfolio is comprised of 100 credit exposures as summarised in Table 1. 65% of the portfolio
LGD is attributed to investment garde (IG) borrowers and 35% to speculative grade (SG)
borrowers according to Moody's rating grades/categories. In each rating category, 80% of
the total LGD is evenly distributed among 20% of the largest debtors. The remaining 20%
of the LGD in each rating category is evenly distributed among the remaining debtors. The
second, larger portfolio comprised of 1,000 credit exposures has exactly the same PD-LGD
structure as in Table 1 and is obtained from the small portfolio by subdividing each credit
exposure into 10 parts.
Table 1: Structure of the small test portfolio
Rating category PD(%) Share in the total Total # of
portfolio LGD(%) debtors
IG: Aa 0.064 35 10
IG: A 0.077 15 10
IG: Baa 0.301 15 25
SG: Ba 1.394 15 25
SG: B 4.477 15 25
SG: C 14.692 5 5
Note: Rating categories and corresponding probabilities of default (PD) were obtained from
Moody's (2006, p. 33). IG indicates investment grade ratings and SG indicates speculative
grade ratings.
4.2. Parameter calibration
In order to assess the model risk evoked by different tail properties of different asset re-
turn distributions, I consider a model with a Gaussian correlation structure and calibrate
dependence parameters of the HAC model in a way that ensures the same linear correlation.
The obligors in the portfolio are grouped into two sub-portfolios according to their rating
grade: sub-portfolio 1 ­ investment garde (IG), sub-portfolio 2 ­ speculative grade (SG). I

denote the within-group linear correlation by spj
, j = 1, 2 and the between-group linear
correlation by p
. For the purposes of an illustrative example, I take the estimates of the
within-group correlation from Puzanova and Siddiqui (2005) and set the between-group cor-
relation to an arbitrarily chosen value which is smaller than the minimum of the within-group
correlation coefficients. Numerical values of the correlation coefficients are given in the upper
panel of Table 2.
The overall Gaussian copula of asset returns has the correlation matrix given by:

In order to calibrate the dependence parameters of the HAC model, I use the following
representation of the Pearson's correlation coefficient:

0
CX,Y
(u, v) - uv dF-1
X
(u)dF-1

(v) (4.2)
for two random variables X and Y .
I put the two-dimensional portfolio-level copula in form (3.9) in combination with Gaussian
marginal cdfs onto the right-hand side and the between-group correlation coefficient p
onto
the left-hand side of the equation (4.2). Then I solve the equation numerically for the copula
parameter p
. Subsequently, I substitute the copula on the right-hand side of (4.2) with the
14
bivariate copula in form (3.8) for the sub-portfolio j and the correlation coefficient on the
left-hand side with spj
and solve for spj
. The results are given in the lower panel of Table 2.
4.3. Results of the simulation study
This subsection reports the results of a simulation study for the test portfolios and model
settings described previously. In each setting, I run a Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio loss
distribution, repeating the simulation loop s = 1.5×107 times in order to achieve more precise
results. I first generate the probability-integral transforms for both models in question.6 I do
this by sampling asset returns from a multivariate normal distribution with the correlation
matrix (4.1) and computing Ui
= FRi
(Ri
) for the Gaussian model. For the HAC model I
sample Ui
directly according to the algorithm in section 3.3. Then I calculate the default
indicators as
Di
:= 1

0,PDi
(Ui
). (4.3)
For each of the s simulation loops, I calculate portfolio loss as:
PLk =

After s simulation runs have been completed, I compute Monte Carlo estimators for the
portfolio loss distribution, VaR and ES for each model setting. The estimators are given by:

Figure 4.3 demonstrates that the loss distribution based on the HAC setting has a much
more heavier tail than the distribution based on the Gaussian setting, which is in line with the
presence of lower tail dependence although the linear correlation is the same. The difference
is more pronounced in the case of the larger portfolio because the more debtors are in the

portfolio, the more combinations of joint defaults are possible and the dependence of rare/tail
events has a greater effect.
As to the measures of portfolio tail risk, the simulation results on VaR and ES at different
confidence levels are presented in Table 3. In all cases, the tail risk figures within the Gaussian
setting are considerably lower than those within the HAC setting. The difference becomes
more distinct, the further into the tail we go. Again, the risk of VaR/ES underestimation if
the assumption of zero lower tail dependence coefficient is wrong is considerably higher for the
larger portfolio, as illustrated in Figure 7. For the same linear correlation of asset returns, the
model risk might be very pronounced when true joint distribution of underlying risk factors
exhibits lower tail dependence. According to the values at risk marked in the figure for the
larger test portfolio, the 99.99%-VaR within the Gaussian setting lies next to the 99%-VaR
within the HAC framework for the portfolio. That is, according to the Gaussian model, losses
of about 10% of the total portfolio LGD and greater are supposed to occur once every 10,000
years. However, they would occur as often as once a century according to the HAC setting.
The results presented above demonstrate that the tail dependence properties of the under-
lying joint distribution of asset returns influence to a great extent the tail behaviour of the
portfolio loss distribution. Dependence parameters of the HAC model affect the probability
of joint borrower defaults and therefore the portfolio tail risk. Table 4 clarifies this issue with
an example. Thereby, a simplified model setting is considered with the same sub-portfolio-
specific parameters for both IG and SG rating grades (spj
= sp
). The simulation results for
the VaR of the smaller portfolio at different confidence levels demonstrate the impact of the
increasing parameter values on the VaR.

5. Conclusions
This paper introduces a novel model for asset returns based on the concept of nested Ar-
chimedean copulas. The model takes account of tail dependence and, therefore, can be
very useful for the purposes of portfolio credit risk assessment. It exhibits a hierarchical
dependence structure which means that it allows for a stronger dependence within specified
sub-portfolios or sectors than between them.
The hierarchical Archimedean copula (HAC) framework presented has a number of techni-
cal merits which provide it with a beneficial simplicity and flexibility. Because it is ensured
by construction that the resulting function is a proper copula, there is no need any more to
check compatibility conditions or parameter restrictions for the nested copula. The sampling
from the HAC becomes straightforward.
Apart from the technical features described, the suggested model might have far-reaching
implications for risk controlling and banking regulation and, on a large scale, for financial
stability. Its implementation would result in a far more conservative assessment of portfolio
credit risk and, consequently, higher economic and regulatory capital requirements. Therefore,
the model is able to counter the systematic underestimation of credit risk in the banking sector
­ one of the basic causes of the recent financial turmoil.
