Collecting information about the prevalence of cannabis use is necessary but not suf-
ficient for understanding the size, dynamics, and outcomes associated with cannabis
markets. This paper uses two data sets describing cannabis consumption in the United
States and Europe to highlight (1) differences in inferences about sub-populations based
on the measure used to quantify cannabis-related activity; (2) how different measures
of cannabis-related activity can be used to more accurately describe trends in cannabis
usage over time; and (3) the correlation between frequency of use in the past-month and
average grams consumed per use-day. Key findings: focusing on days of use instead of
prevalence shows substantially greater increases in U.S. cannabis use in recent years;
however, the recent increase is mostly among adults, not youth. Relatively more rapid
growth in use days also occurred among the college-educated and Hispanics. Further, data
from a survey conducted in seven European countries show a strong positive correlation
between frequency of use and quantity consumed per day of use, suggesting consumption
is even more skewed toward the minority of heavy users than is suggested by days-of-use
calculations.
Keywords: cannabis, marijuana, substance abuse research, drug use metrics, drug use trends
INTRODUCTION
In substance abuse research, "use" is operationalized in terms of
prevalence (i.e., how many individuals used a drug within a given
period of time). However, prevalence is neither the only nor the
ideal metric available. Other metrics, such as quantity of drug
consumed may provide more insights into behaviors associated
with intoxication and health-related outcomes, contact with law
enforcement, and flows of money into black markets.
Studying users is perhaps the norm in substance abuse epi-
demiological research. One can ask a sample of people (e.g., in
households or students in classrooms) questions about their drug
use in order to learn, for example, how many used a given drug
in the past-year, and on how many days did they consume. This is
undoubtedly a useful perspective. We might find out, for example,
that most marijuana users did not purchase the marijuana they
consumed most recently; instead, it was shared with them or given
to them for free.
However, imagine we could instead sample on the drug or,
equivalently, the episode of drug use, rather than on the user. That
would be like taking a random sample of all the grams consumed
over the past-year, and asking: what are the users of this drug
like? As we report below, from that perspective 88% of marijuana
is consumed by someone who most recently obtained marijuana
by purchasing it (as opposed to sharing or receiving it as a gift).
The two perspectives suggest very different conclusions concern-
ing the relative importance of purchases vs. gifts in retail marijuana
distribution.
If the goal is to understand the drug-using careers of users,
we might prefer to study a sample of users. But if the goal is to
understand market-related quantities like how demand is affected
by price or the roots of systemic violence, following the drug could
be more valuable.
Naturally it is not literally possible to sample on chunks of the
drug. No one assigns each gram a unique identification number,
let alone a phone number that survey researchers could call. How-
ever, we can approximate this by weighting respondents by the
quantities they consume. The purpose of this paper is to use a
variety of data sets describing cannabis consumption to highlight
the sometimes substantial differences in inference that arise when
focusing on consumption, not consumers.
Before proceeding let us illustrate the principle numerically
with a simple, extreme, and stylized example. Suppose there are
just two kinds of cannabis users, "light" and "heavy," who use 1 g
and 1 ounce per month, respectively. Suppose further that 80% of
users are light users, so there are four light users for every heavy
user. Obviously when sampling on users, one would report that
most cannabis users are light, few are heavy.
But since each heavy user consumes about 28 times as much
as a light user (1 ounce = 28.35 g), the heavy users consume
28/(28 + 4 × 1) = 88% of the cannabis. Prior research has shown
that different conclusions can be drawn when observing light vs.
heavy users [e.g., (1)].
Furthermore, if over time there were no change in the number
of cannabis users, but the ratio of light vs. heavy users switched

Burns et al. Statistics on cannabis users
from 80/20 to 20/80, then consumption would increase by 250%
even though there was no change whatsoever in the number of
users.
Because there is actually a continuum of usage, the difference
between studying cannabis users and studying cannabis use is
not so extreme, but it is large enough to matter, as we demon-
strate below with a variety of examples. The basic observation is
that when a covariate is positively correlated with quantity con-
sumed conditional on there being some use, then individuals with
that covariate account for a greater share of use than they do of
users. For example, male users consume more than female users,
so males account for a larger share of consumption than they do of
prevalence. Conversely, users who are college graduates consume
less intensively than do less educated users, so college graduates
account for a smaller share of cannabis consumption than they do
of cannabis users.
DATA
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a
nationally representative survey consisting of interviews con-
ducted with randomly selected individuals ages 12 and older.
NSDUH contains data on the prevalence of the use and abuse
of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal substances. The survey contains
sample weights that were used for all analyses to provide national-
level estimates. From 2002 through 2011, there is an annual series
of comparable data on past-year and past-30-day cannabis use
(which we will refer to as"past-month use"throughout this paper),
the number of use-days in the past-month for those who used in
the last month, the number of use-days in the past-year for others
who used in the last year, whether cannabis was purchased in the
last month, the number of purchases in the last month for those
who bought cannabis in the last month, and information about
the most recent purchase of cannabis (amount purchased, cost
of purchase, location of purchase, etc.). Starting in 2004 NSDUH
also contains information about use of blunts (hollowed out cigar
shellsfilledwithcannabis),whichwasusedtorefinecountsof past-
month cannabis users and use-days for those years the item was
available. While the impact of including survey items about blunts
is small, it should be noted that counts of cannabis users and use-
days from 2002 to 2003 may be slightly underestimated. In addi-
tion,NSDUH contains demographic information for each respon-
dent that can be used to characterize users. One limitation of
NSDUH is that it relies on self-report, which may introduce social
desirability or recall bias (2). Another limitation of NSDUH is that
it does not collect data from some populations that are known to
have higher rates of illicit drug use, such as the incarcerated and
homelesswhoarenotinshelters(SAMHSA),butthiscanbeshown
to be a relatively insignificant deficiency in the case of cannabis (3).
The EU Drugs Markets II (EUMII) web-survey conducted by
van Laar et al. (4) gathered information from a convenience sam-
ple of 4,156 cannabis users in seven countries: Bulgaria (n = 208),
the Czech Republic (522), Italy (1,104), the Netherlands (1,128),
Portugal (150), Sweden (791), and the United Kingdom (283).
We focus on 2,530 observations since 1,626 of the respondents
did not sufficiently answer the questions about quantity con-
sumed (days per month, units per day, and grams per unit). For
additional analyses of the EUMII cannabis data, see Caulkins et al.
(5). As survey respondents often have difficulty answering directly
questions about quantity consumed per day, this survey's great
innovation was to present respondents with picture cards, visually
contrasting various amounts of cannabis with both a ruler and a
credit card, to facilitate their ability to estimate how much they
have consumed.
The EUMII survey has a number of limitations. Since it is an
internet survey based on a convenience sample largely recruited
on the web (i.e., no sampling frame), there is an obvious selection
bias toward those who (1) use the internet, (2) are not concerned
with sharing data about illegal behaviors online, and (3) think that
volunteering to complete marijuana surveys is a good use of their
time. van Laar et al. (4) report that while internet penetration
in the EU is high (72% of the population), there was variation
among the selected countries ­ 49% in Bulgaria, 51% in Portu-
gal, 58% in Italy, 71% in the Czech Republic, 84% in the United
Kingdom,90% in the Netherlands,and 92.9% in Sweden (Internet
World Stats 2011). Furthermore, recruitment methods differed by
country and van Laar et al. note that most countries employed
strategies that biased the sample toward attracting students and
young adults.
Also some respondents may try to complete the survey multiple
times or give unrealistic answers. Since incentives were not offered
to complete the survey, we are less concerned about the former. As
for the latter,which is not unique to web surveys,van Laar et al. (4)
screened the data, setting unrealistic values to missing and drop-
ping respondents "who indicated consuming more than 20 units
(joints, pipes etc.) on an average use day" (68).
These limitations preclude using the EUMII data for estimating
relative numbers of low- vs. high-frequency users, or for contrast-
ing patterns across countries, but they should be of less concern
when using the data as we do here to explore the correlation
between use-days in the past-month and the average number
of joints consumed per use day, particularly since the results are
consistent with analyses from the U.S. (6) and Canada (7).
METHODS AND RESULTS
In the next three sections,we highlight (1) differences in inferences
about sub-populations based on the measure used to quantify
cannabis-related activity (past-year use, past-month use, past-
month days of use,any past-month purchase,and number of past-
month purchases); (2) how different measures can be employed to
describe more accurately trends in cannabis usage over time; and
(3) the correlation between frequency of use in the past-month
and average grams consumed per day.
CROSS-SECTIONAL COMPARISONS OF USE VS. USE-DAYS IN NSDUH
National survey on drug use and health asks respondents whether
they used cannabis in the last year, whether they used in the last
month and, if so, how many days they used within the last month.
It also asks whether they bought in the last month and, if so, how
often. For any given subpopulation, say males, these variables let
one define five proportions:
1. Males' share of past-year users.
2. Males' share of past-month users.
3. Males' share of past-month days of use.
4. Males' share of those who purchased within the last month.
5. Males' share of past-month purchases.
Frontiers in Psychiatry | Addictive Disorders and Behavioral Dyscontrol November 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 138 | 2
Burns et al. Statistics on cannabis users
Sometimes the proportions are all very close. Often they vary,
sometimes substantially. As a general rule, for any attribute that is
positively associated with cannabis use, the strength of that associ-
ation grows as one moves through the list of the five proportions.
For example,males use more cannabis than females. That is appar-
ent even in simple past-year prevalence; males account for 60% of
past-year cannabis users identified by the 2011 NSDUH. That pro-
portion grows to 64% of past-month users, 69% of past-month
days of use, 70% of past-month purchasers, and 72% of past-
monthpurchases.Table1showsthesefiveproportionsforavariety
of groups.
Variation across some rows is striking. Only 14% of past-year
cannabis users meet the criteria for cannabis abuse or dependence,
but they account for 26% of past-month days of use and 37% of
past-month purchases. Perhaps the most striking contrast con-
cerns blunts. Only 27% of past-year cannabis users report using a
blunt within the last month,but those individuals account for 73%
of cannabis purchases. On the protective factors side, the affluent,
married, and college grads tend to use moderately; for example,
college graduates account for 19% of past-year users,but only 13%
of days of use and just 5% of purchases.
There is literature examining disparities in criminal justice
sanctioning of drug users [e.g., (8­10)]. With varying degrees
of sophistication, these studies compare for given groups (e.g.,
African-Americans) the share of some measure of sanctioning
(arrests, convictions, incarceration, etc.) with their share of use or
a use-related proxy. If the groups'shares of all use-related measure
were the same, then it would not matter much which measure was
used. But figures for those who were ever arrested and booked (see
Table 1) show that is not the case. Hence, to get a more complete
picture of disparities,such studies should probably do the compar-
ison with the full range of measures considered in Table 1. This is
not a novel idea; Brownsberger (11) noted something similar with
respect to alternate measures of crack use. But it is important.
To give one example, consider the distinction between using
and purchasing. Possession and use per se carry relatively little
risk of arrest. As Nguyen and Reuter (10) show, the probabil-
ity of arrest per episode of cannabis use in the United States is
only about 1 in 3,000. Purchasing by contrast may carry a greater
risk of arrest, although there is some question about the propor-
tion of drug arrests attributable to purchase transactions (12). If
the number of purchases per day of use were the same across all
groups, this would be a distinction without a difference. However,
as Figure 1 shows, young people collectively report making more
purchases per day of reported use than do older users. For exam-
ple, 12­17-year-olds report fewer past-month days of use than do
50­64-year-olds (21 vs. 33 million), but many more past-month
purchases (7.6 vs. 3.2 million).
Statistics indicating that the burden of arrest falls dispropor-
tionately on youth relative to their share of all users (9) may not be
prima facie evidence of discrimination if making more purchases
per day of use increases the risk of arrest per year of use. For exam-
ple, 18­25-year-olds account for 49% of NSDUH respondents

account for only 35% of past-year cannabis users. That appears to
be a disproportionate arrest burden, but 18­25-year-olds account
for 46% of buys reported in the past-month.
Likewise,therateof arrestamongpast-yearadultcannabisusers
is considerably higher for those with less than a high school educa-
tion than overall (3.6 vs. 2.5 arrests per 100 users), but they make
more buys per day of use, so the number of arrests per 100 buys is
actually slightly below average (1.1 vs. 1.2 for adults overall).
Table 2 illustrates patterns for race and educational status.
Non-Hispanic blacks represent 13% of past-year cannabis users
vs. 23% of drug arrests reported by those users, but they report
making 24% of the buys. Thus, some of their higher arrest rate
may be a consequence of their purchase patterns. Indeed, Ram-
chand et al. (13) suggest that African-Americans may not only
make more buys but also make riskier buys (e.g., more likely to
buy outdoors).
In sum, the measure of use matters. Therefore when drawing
inferences about use one should consider which measure of use is
appropriate in any given context and/or test to see if the conclu-
sions are robust with respect to the measure of use employed.
COMPARING USE VS. USE-DAYS IN NSDUH OVER TIME
The analysis above pertains to snap-shots based on the 2011
NSDUH, yet trends over time provide another interesting per-
spective. In this section, we explore trends in cannabis use from
years 2002 through 2011 of NSDUH and show how studying past-
month use-days provides additional information about changes
in cannabis usage not apparent when merely studying prevalence
of use.
Figure 2 shows the change since 2002 in four measures of
cannabis use: past-year prevalence, past-month prevalence (past-
month users), number of daily/near-daily users (those who used
cannabis 21 days or more in the last month), and past-month days
of use. All four measures show an increasing trend, but the growth
in usage (proxied by past-month use-days) outstrips the growth in
consumers because of the increase in daily/near-daily use. That is,
consumption grew primarily because of an increase in the average
frequency of use, not just because of an increase in the overall
number of users.

Proportion who are daily/near-daily users
We calculated the total number of past-month use-days for each
year from 2002 through 2011 and divide this total across four
frequency of use categories: those who used 1­3 days, those
who used 4­10 days, those who used 11­20 days, and those who
used 21 days or more in the last month (daily/near-daily users).
Figure 3 shows the growth in the total number of users and total
number of use-days for all four groups. Although daily/near-
daily users represented less than one-quarter of past-month
cannabis users in 2002 and roughly one-third of past-month
users in 2011, they account for the vast majority of use-days
and are thus are presumably responsible for the majority of
consumption.
To understand more about the daily/near-daily users who are
driving the increase in consumption, we explored their demo-
graphic characteristics over this 10-year time period. Examining
the age distribution of the daily/near-daily users shows that youth's
share of consumption plummeted by almost 50%, and more
generally consumption shifted to older adults (see Figure 4). In
2002, 12­17-year-olds represented 13% of daily/near-daily users;
in 2011, that had dwindled to 7%. The proportion of daily/near-
daily users attributable to young adults (ages 18­21 years) also
decreased from 26% in 2002 to 21% in 2011. The proportion
aged 22 years and older increased from 62 to 73%. In other words,
the age distribution of daily/near-daily users shifted so that the
average age of daily/near-daily users is higher in 2011 than it was
in 2002.
There was a notable inversion of the ratio of youth (ages 12­
17) to older adults (ages 50 and up). In 2002, there were more
than three times as many youth as older adults using cannabis on
a daily/near-daily basis; in 2011 there were 2.5 times more older
adults than youth using on a daily/near-daily basis.
We found a similar shift in the age distribution of daily/near-
dailyusersof alcoholandcigarettes;however,itwasnotasdramatic
and we did not see the same inversion that was observed for
cannabis use (see Table 3). There was disproportionate growth
in older populations over this time due to the aging of the "baby

boom" generation (14, 15), which explains most of the growth
in older daily/near-daily users of alcohol and most of the growth
in older daily/near-daily users of cigarettes. However, the increase
in the proportion of older daily/near-daily users of cannabis was
much greater than the increase in the proportion of older individ-
uals in the population, suggesting an increase in heavy cannabis
use among older individuals.
We also examined the distribution of race/ethnicity and
found an increase in the proportion of Hispanic daily/near-daily
cannabis users (from 8% in 2002 to 14% in 2011). While the
proportion of the population identifying as Hispanic increased
over this time period (16, 17), the relative increase in the popu-
lation was not as large as the relative increase in daily/near-daily
cannabis users. We also found a decrease in the proportion of
non-Hispanic white daily/near-daily cannabis users (from 75%
in 2002 to 66% in 2011) and little change in the proportion
of non-Hispanic black daily/near-daily users, who represented
14% of daily/near-daily cannabis users in 2002 and 16% in
2011. There was not a parallel change in the distribution of
race/ethnicity among daily/near-daily users of cigarettes or alcohol
(see Table 3).
Educational attainment was relatively stable from 2002 to 2011
for daily/near-daily users of cannabis and cigarettes, but there
was a shift in the proportion of daily/near-daily alcohol users,
so that the group was more educated at the end of the time
period (86% had more than a high school education in 2002,
while 92% had more than high school education in 2011 ­ see
Table 3).

Because NSDUH did not collect data about blunts in 2002 and 2003, use-days

Past-month use-days
For the most part, demographic changes in daily/near-daily users
are also reflected in past-month use day trends. We explored
changes in the past-month use-days since 2002 and found that
consumption among adults over 50 grew sharply over the past
10 years while past-month use-days among those less than 18 years
of age remained relatively stable (see Figure 5 ­ note that base rates
for older users in 2002 are relatively low).
From 2002 to 2011, all race/ethnicities experienced growth
in the number of cannabis use-days, particularly after 2008.
Hispanics and other races had the largest relative increases (130
and 105%, respectively); however, despite the relatively slower
growth, non-Hispanic white users continue to be responsible for
the majority of use-days (see Table 4).
An exploration of use-days by education level shows less dra-
matic change than the change in age distribution (see Table 4).
There was growth in the number of use-days among all adults
regardless of education level; overall, use-days among adults
increased by 49% over this time period. However, the largest
relative increase was among those with a college degree, whose
use-days increased by 72% from 2002 to 2011.
The shift in the distribution of use-days and daily/near-daily
users from a younger to an older population is noteworthy. For
comparison, we display the age distribution of alcohol, cigarettes,
and cocaine use-days to determine whether a similar shift occurred
with other substances (see Figure 6). Adults over the age of 30
were already responsible for the majority of alcohol, cigarettes,
and cocaine use-days in 2002; however, there was a similar shift in
the percent of cocaine, cigarette, and alcohol use-days attributable
to those older than 50 and away from those 21 and under.
CONTRASTING USE-DAYS WITH AMOUNTS USED
Although use-days provide more information about consumption
than does prevalence alone, weighting respondents by days of use
may still understate the skew in the distribution of use. This is due
to an apparent positive correlation between intensity of use (grams
consumed per day) and the frequency of use (days of consumption
per month). Zeisser et al. (7), for example, observe a positive cor-
relation between the reported number of joints consumed per day
and self-reported days of use per month. Their data suggest that
those using on 30 days per month consumed about three times as
many joints per day as did those using only 1­4 days per month.

Because NSDUH did not collect data about blunts in 2002 and 2003, use-days
may be underestimated for these years. We have included data from 2004 when
the questions about blunts were introduced for reference.
Zeisser and colleagues' analysis does not consider the possibil-
ity that joint or unit size might also be positively correlated with
frequency of use, but the EUMII web-survey (4) described above
did gather information about quantity consumed per use-day (in
grams) by using picture cards. The EUMII data suggest that when
denominating by quantity (weight) consumed instead of number
of units, that ratio may be closer to 4:1 (see Figure 7).
This relationship has important implications for what one
might term "equivalence ratios." Naturally it takes multiple light
users to consume as much as one heavy user, but how many? That
depends on the measure of use. In particular, since it appears that
those who use frequently also consume more per day of use, the
ratios are considerably higher when the equivalence is one in terms
of units or grams used rather than days of use.
If one focuses on days of use, it would take about 10­12 people
using 1­5 times per month to match one daily user, but it would
take more than three times that many (>40) to match a single
daily user in terms of grams consumed per month. Figure 8 shows
these equivalence ratios for each of the categories of users, and
with equivalence expressed in terms of both days of use (striped
bars) and grams per month (solid bars).
Consider what this means for daily users' share of the market.
The one-in-five past-month users who consume daily account for
almost 60% of consumption, while the one-third of past-month
users who consume less than four times per month account for
just 2% of consumption.
DISCUSSION
The best metric for studying cannabis clearly depends on the
objective of the research. For those interested in the prevalence
of cannabis use, the number of users is likely sufficient. How-
ever, to obtain a more accurate portrayal of cannabis use and
users' behavior or to better understand the market, one should
look to frequency and amount of consumption. Likewise, those
interested in drug-related criminal justice outcomes should focus
on behavior that increases risk of arrest, such as the number of
drug purchases and location of these purchases (e.g., indoor vs.
outdoor).
Examining frequency of use over time provides a picture of not
only changes in who is using but also how individuals are using.
Beginning in 2007, there were increases not only in the number of

users but also in the number of use-days per user and the num-
ber of daily/near-daily users, suggesting heavier use over this time
period. Some may wonder if this increase might be attributable to
more honest reporting about cannabis use. (One way to assess this
would be to examine how support for legalization in the Gallup
poll changed over this period, but the lack of poll data between
2005 and 2009 complicates this exercise (18)]. However, there are
supply side indicators which suggest a large increase in domestic
and Mexican production post-2005 [El Paso Intelligence Center
(19)].
The demographic shifts in cannabis use-days and daily/near-
daily users (particularly the shift from a younger to an older
population) are intriguing and raise additional questions. Given
our knowledge of drug use cycles and awareness that initiation of

drug use typically happens at a young age (20, 21), can the increase
in use among older individuals be attributed entirely to carrying
drug use habits over time (which seems unlikely given the increase
in use with respect to the relative increase in the older popula-
tion) or something else? Are these older users using for medicinal
or recreational purposes? Are these trends reflected in arrest or
treatment datasets? Are users replacing cannabis use with use of
another substance?Why did use-days among Hispanics increase so
dramatically over this time period relative to other racial-ethnic
groups? Does the increase in use-days among college-educated
individuals indicate greater social acceptability or something else?
Zeisser et al. (7) and the EUMII web-survey (4) indicate that
in Europe amount consumed per day is positively correlated with
frequency of use,and thus,heavy users are responsible for a greater
share of consumption than of days of use. A logical next question
might be whether that pattern holds also for U.S. cannabis users
and whether that means the average amount consumed per past-
month user has increased along with frequency of consumption,
at least in potency-adjusted terms. Preliminary analyses of data
from Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) suggest there was
not a statistically significant change in the average size of a joint
over the 2000s (Kilmer et al., in preparation), but this is not a
settled question. Further, future analyses must also account for
the fact that cannabis is consumed in a variety of ways other than
smoking joints (e.g., pipes, vaporizers, edibles) and that there may
be substantial variation in potency as well.
In summary, by sampling on use-days and amount used, we
find that most of the consumption and, hence, most of the asso-
ciated intoxication and flow of money into the black markets,
comes from people who use frequently. Examining the num-
ber of users can be enlightening but does not fully capture the
dynamics of cannabis usage. In order to understand market-
related quantities like demand, and to better assess implications
for crime, health, and productivity, researchers should analyze
cannabis usage indicators like use-days and quantity consumed.
