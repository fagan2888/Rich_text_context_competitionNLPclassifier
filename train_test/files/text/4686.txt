Human Rights Violations and Mental Illness:
Implications for Engagement and
Adherence
Magnus Mfoafo-M'Carthy1 and Stephanie Huls1
Abstract
The literature review identifies and examines human rights violations experienced by individuals with mental illness on a
global level. In addition, the intent is to explore how current legislation either reinforces or supports these violations. The
authors conducted an extensive review of the existing literature on mental health and human rights violations. Keywords
were used to exhaust databases on this subject matter and to collect data, interpretations, and government publications on
mental health and human rights. Individuals with mental illness are experiencing human rights violations on a global scale
both within and outside of psychiatric institutions. These violations include denial of employment, marriage, procreation,
and education; malnutrition; physical abuse; and negligence. This information was reviewed and compiled into the following
article, along with interpretations of current implications and suggestions for future research. It is evident that more
supports need to be instilled, especially within the context of low- and middle-income countries lacking adequate staffing
and accessible services. Furthermore, legislation needs to be modified, updated, or created with relevant systems in place
to make these laws enforceable.

Introduction
It is estimated that approximately 500 million individuals
globally are affected by mental illness (International Labour
Organisation, 2000). The World Health Organization
(WHO; 2012) speculates that depression alone will rank
second highest in the global burden of disease by 2020. In
Canada, it is believed that mental illness will affect
approximately 20% of the population in their lifetime
(Regehr & Glancy, 2010). According to recent figures, the
direct and indirect economic cost of mental illness is
estimated to range from 48 to 50 billion dollars (Lim,
Jacobs, Ohinwaa, Schopflower, & Dewa, 2008). This
significant expense is not expected to decrease, but rather
increase over time and moreover affect the labor force
while straining the world economy (International Labour
Organisation, 2000). Given the inherent vulnerability of
those with mental health issues and the stigma of being a
burden on society, it is essential that human rights are
acknowledged for this population and also that human
rights violations are globally recognized and curtailed.
Reports show that individuals with mental health issues are
maltreated and marginalized due to the nature of their
illness. This trend is attributed to a number of factors
including culture, ethnicity, religion, language, and poverty.
Although there are ongoing discourses over the
treatment of individuals diagnosed with mental illness and
those exhibiting mental health symptoms around the world,
it is important to note that the severity of abuse varies from
one culture to another based on inherent beliefs. For
instance, just as in certain cultures, women are not accorded
equal rights and are relegated to the background, some
cultures perceive the mentally ill as not being part of
normal society; therefore, those with mental illness are
subjected to varying forms of abuse. The maltreatment and
abuse of the mentally ill have been widely captured in
literature (Awad & Voruganti, 2008).
The focus of this study was to explore the literature on
how mental health issues affect the rights of individuals
with mental illness. The rationale for this literature review
is to examine globally the human rights abuses of mental
health issues and shed light on its impact on economies
worldwide. Furthermore, this review intends to explore

options to enhance the treatment adherence to practices that
will improve the conditions of individuals marginalized due
to their mental health condition.
Simply put, the question to be explored will be to "examine
how human right abuses/violations affect the mentally ill
globally." The study will review the literature as a foundation
to our findings and then give recommendations.
Literature Review
Mental health embodies the integration of psychological,
emotional, and social harmony. It encompasses ones quality of
life and general well-being. Culture, language, ethnicity, and
religion play a significant role in the interpretation of mental
health causes. Studies show that being diagnosed with or
exhibiting symptoms of mental health issues exposes a person
or community to labeling. Such people are branded as socially
inadequate and are associated with resulting shame,
humiliation, and loss of face. In most cultures, groups with low
positions in hierarchical social structure experience high rates
of mental health problems (Rosenfield, 2012). In modern
society, connection with mental illness exposes a person to
levels of medicalization and marginalization.
In certain cultures, mental illness is perceived as a sign
of weakness or curse. This negative connotation results in
family members distancing themselves from or maltreating
those who are ill. Furthermore, those with mental illness are
deemed unproductive and perceived as not contributing to
the upkeep of the family. It is also argued that the lack of
resources in African countries as well as in other
developing countries makes it difficult for governments to
enhance the treatment or improve the conditions of the
mentally ill, which inevitably exposes many to abuses.
Over the years, research has shown that stigma plays a
significantly debilitating role in the treatment of the
mentally ill (Barke, Nyarko, & Klecha, 2011; Link et al.,
2001). The literature on stigma describes how individuals
with disabilities, including mental illness, often find
themselves on the periphery of society. This circumstance is
deemed "an attribute that is deeply discrediting" (Goffman,
1963, p. 3). Such individuals are marginalized, mistreated,
and often stigmatized in society. Individuals with mental
illness are often viewed as "strangers" where this
characteristic of "strangeness" frequently results in social
distancing (Baumann, 2007). Unfortunately, as this
treatment is prevalent in both the industrial and developing
countries, the argument could be made that governments are
failing to put in place measures or systems to enhance the
treatment of the mentally ill. Thus, very limited progress
has been made to improve the lot of the mentally ill who are
ostracized in society.
Method
The intent of the study was to review the global literature on
the subject and examine how different cultures respond to this
topic. The search criteria included papers on the treatment of
the mentally ill in various countries throughout the world. The
major databases used to identify the articles were PubMed,
PubMed Central Canada, SAGE Journals, African Journals
Online, Scholars Portal, EBSCOHost, ProQuest, PsycINFO,
and Google Scholar. The WHO database was also examined
for the purpose of this venture. Only papers published in
English were allowed for consideration in this review. The
review examined peer-reviewed published articles, policy
papers, as well as government publications since 2000.
Keywords or statements of combinations of these terms were
included in the search along with librarian assistance.
Keywords (and a combination of these words) included mental
health*, mental illness*, rights, human rights*, psychiatry*,
human rights violations and mental illness, colonial psychiatry,
and deprivation of liberty. This method yielded numerous
articles related to mental illness and human rights.
In the process of searching the literature, keywords (rather
than titles and abstracts) were used to examine the documents
for matches. All of the references were recorded and stored
electronically using refworks. Tracking was conducted after
reading the papers and bibliographies were reviewed for
further documents. The criteria for inclusion included both
qualitative and quantitative articles on human rights and
mental illness. For the purpose of this study, literature reviews
and meta-analyses were not included. In the event that the
same data were reported by two different papers, only the first
report has been included. Papers published in peer-reviewed
journals and gray literature were included.
Given this study's objective on mental health and human
rights violations, certain articles were excluded from
review, in cases where it was determined that the study,
article topic, or demographic lay outside of the purview of
this article. Information was recorded down in the form of
notes, entered into a literature table (see Appendix), and
categorized by themes which are represented in the
following "Results" section.
In total, approximately 1,000 articles, book chapters, and
dissertations were found. Of these, 200 papers were reviewed
because they either focused or had some discussions on mental
health and human rights abuses. Articles were excluded for
numerous reasons including the following: reported the same
data as other papers, did not explore issues being looked at,
literature reviews and meta-analysis. Nevertheless, the most
significant were those that focused on mental health and
human rights or articles that reflected research conducted
internationally. Of the resulting articles, book chapters, and
theses elicited from the search, 37 articles were deemed
appropriate and utilized for the purpose of adequately
addressing human rights and mental illness. Thus, from the
200 papers reviewed, a preliminary review narrowed the
findings to 37 articles and government publications­­31
articles and 6 government documents. Articles that did not
specifically focus on human rights and mental illness were
excluded. Theses and book chapters that did not directly
address the issues of human rights and mental illness were
excluded as well.

Results
Illiteracy and Mental Health
The findings emphasized the importance of taking note of
the co-morbidity of illiteracy and mental illness. This has
been linked to an increased likelihood of experiencing
human rights violations, as illiteracy can adversely affect
the ability to reach out for formal supports. In India,
illiteracy has a greater influence on women than men,
where despite free education, women are less likely to be
encouraged to attend school (Vijayalakshmi, Ramachandra,
Reddemma, & Math, 2012).
Stigmatization may also play a role in the educational
opportunities for those with mental health issues as
reflected by the high incidence of dropouts. Students with
mental illness can face teasing, harassment, and prejudice
from their peers, and arguably, their teachers (WHO, 2010).
Development Programs and Mental Health
Despite the creation of development programs intended to
improve the lives of the world's most vulnerable
populations, such programs exclude, often intentionally, the
mentally ill as part of their recipients. A striking example is
the Bangladesh Vulnerable Group Development Program,
which stipulates that service users needed to be "mentally
and physically sound" to access the program (WHO, 2010,
p. 3). UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon clarifies the
implications of this exclusion:
The rate of mental disorders and the need for care is highest
among disadvantaged people­­yet these are precisely the
groups with the lowest access to appropriate services. At the
same time, fear of stigma leads many to avoid seeking care.
The consequences are enormous in terms of disability, human
suffering and economic loss. We have a pressing obligation to
scale up care and services for mental disorders, especially
among the disadvantaged, while stepping up efforts to protect
the human rights of those affected. (WHO, 2010, p. 7)
This inequality even extends to emergency and disaster
situations. After Hurricane Katrina in the United States,
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
allegedly discriminated against those with mental health
issues based on the belief that these individuals were
dangerous (WHO, 2010).
Furthermore, the unemployment rate for mentally ill
individuals is approximately 70% to 90%; yet, development
programs that create job opportunities often omit these
individuals in their planning and enactment of projects
(WHO, 2010).
Prison Settings and Mental Health Court
In fact, individuals with mental illness who are receiving
care in psychiatric institutions suffer greater human rights
violations than individuals who are in correctional facilities.
While those in psychiatric care may not have committed a
crime, they are subjected to a similar removal of rights and
liberties as with a criminal offender. Comparable with their
criminal counterparts, individuals with mental illness are
perceived as "more dangerous [and] less competent"; two
qualities that are not welcome within general society
(Diseth & Hoglend, 2011, p. 393).
An additional area of concern regards individuals
determined to be not criminally responsible and therefore
detained either in the psychiatric section within a prison or
in a designated wing within a hospital setting. According to
Fellner (2006), the majority of incarcerated individuals in
the United States of America are struggling with mental
health issues:
Indeed, one of the primary roles of prisons in the United States
today is to house the mentally ill. Prisoners have rates of
mental illness that are two to four times greater than the rates
of members of the general public. (p. 1)
Housing of the mentally ill in prisons can be partially
attributed to the lack of community-based services that
were to be developed as a result of hospital closures
(Fellner, 2006).
Regardless of the environment, the intent is to provide
psychiatric treatment to accommodate the unique needs of
the prison population. However, issues arise, such as the
cohabitation of varying degrees of mental health severities,
lack of appropriate professional training for staff members
(Naudts et al., 2005), disciplining individuals instead of
providing psychiatric support, verbal abuse and neglect
from staff, and the exacerbation of mental illness due to
confinement (Fellner, 2006). As symptoms of mental illness
may be viewed by untrained prison staff as behavioral
issues, these prisoners can build lengthy disciplinary
records, which could potentially negatively affect their
release time (Fellner, 2006; Matejkowski, Caplan, &
Cullen, 2010). Reintegration into society and the
opportunity for parole are often contingent upon program
participation; yet, these classes infrequently consider the
additional support that individuals with mental illness may
require. In addition, programs may not address certain life
skills that are unique to those with mental illness such as
compliance with medication (Matejkowski et al., 2010).
Szasz (as cited in Breeding, 2006) suggests that those
with mental illness who have been involuntarily admitted
may be treated worse than their criminal counterparts:
A prisoner will be released after he completes his sentence, and
possibly before. A mental patient may be required to undergo a
change in his "inner personality"--a change that may be
induced by measures far more intrusive than anything
permitted in a jail--before the psychiatric authorities let him
go. And they may never let him go. Commitment, unlike a
sentence, is for an indefinite period. (p. 252)
4 SAGE Open
Breeding (2006) further highlights the contradiction of
justice: Individuals in mental health court are guilty until
proven innocent. The added danger is that an individual's
refutation of a diagnosis can be interpreted as a symptom of
their mental illness.
Physical Health and Mental Health
The gap in service provision for those with mental illness
transfers into the health care system as well. Those with
mental illness are at a higher risk of acquiring considerable
physical health problems, which potentially shortens their
lifespan (WHO, 2010). Human rights violations occur
frequently within health care settings, if these services are
available to those with mental health issues at all (P. Hunt
& Mesquita, 2006). An example of this neglect can be
found in a shelter in Indonesia that houses individuals with
mental illness. During a 7-month time period, 181 of the
644 individuals died of diarrhea or lack of nourishment
(WHO, 2010).
Tarantola (2007) points out a cyclical relationship
between physical and mental health. Those who experience
human rights violations are at an increased risk of
experiencing physical health concerns. Poor health, in turn,
increases individuals' susceptibility to human rights
violations (Tarantola, 2007).
Decision-Making Ability and Mental Illness
Callaghan and Ryan (2012) review the practices of
compulsory treatment in Australia and stated that this form
of treatment should only concern individuals who are
unable to make independent decisions. While this could
equally result in a human rights violation, the authors
suggest the following criteria for an individual who is able
to make decisions: ability to comprehend, recall, repeat, and
utilize the information presented to them (Boyle, 2011;
Callaghan & Ryan, 2012). In 2004, the European Court of
Human Rights emphasized that temporarily detaining an
individual who does not offer consent, nor has the capacity
to do so, could be considered a deprivation of liberty. In
response, the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards was
implemented to ensure the rights of individuals in this
position (Boyle, 2011).
Social/Cultural Stigmatization of Mental Illness
While medical conditions typically have tests, lists of
symptoms, and clear treatment methods, mental illness are
not as "tangible" and can therefore be viewed as less
credible, which only furthers stigmatization (Loo, Trollor,
Alonzo, Rendina, & Kavess, 2010, p. 423). This lack of
understanding of mental illness conducted through a
biomedical lens rather than from the perspective of "social
justice, quality of life, human rights and human security"
(Giacaman et al., 2011, p. 547). This also raises the concern
of applying Western standards and mental health techniques
in countries where there are alternative understanding of
mental illness, descriptive language, and treatment
techniques. Some countries continue to rely on traditional
and/or faith healers, family, and community to remedy their
mental health issues (Giacaman et al., 2011; Vijayalakshmi
et al., 2013). Davar (2008) suggests that the West's
insistence that medication is more effective than counseling
in low-income countries may be influenced by underlying
tones of colonialism or even as a means to create further
profit for the pharmaceutical industry.
Further to not knowing their rights, individuals with
mental health concerns are often stigmatized by societal and
cultural views. From "not . . . a human being at all" to being
seen as "facing punishment for their past actions,"
individuals struggle to find support within their community,
not to mention on a higher systemic level (Drew et al.,
2011, p. 1669). The occurrence of stigmatization is
exacerbated with the viewpoint that the cause of mental
illness is internal and not something that can be addressed
from a social or systemic shift (Kogstad, 2009). In India,
the principle of karma can impede those with mental illness
from reaching out for support due to its implied culpability
(Vijayalakshmi et al., 2013). Society also stereotypes those
with mental illness as feeble, aggressive, of lower
intelligence, or even victim to paranormal influences
(WHO, 2010).
As evident throughout this review, it is important to
consider culture when studying the types of treatments
offered in different communities. For example, out of the
25 nations reviewed by the World Health Organization's
Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems
(WHO-AIMS), Korea ranked third in terms of
involuntary admissions to hospital. This has created
concern regarding forcible admission; however, it is
suggested that these numbers must be viewed through a
cultural lens. Bola, Park, and Kim (2011) indicate that
these numbers can be attributed to the fact that stigma
prevents individuals from voluntarily accessing
treatment; also, these services may not be adequately
supported financially for individuals.
Addressing Stigma
Given the scope of individuals who are affected and how
this relates to national levels of success and accountability,
implementing education and awareness programs is
essential to decreasing stigmatization (Mwanza et al.,
2011). However, it should also be noted that stigmatization
is a primary cause of human rights violations and that
labeling individuals can in fact cause further harm to this
population. This gap seems to have been addressed on a
grassroots level by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
and community efforts through support groups and
implementation of traditional healing practices (Dhanda &
Narayan, 2007).
Mfoafo-M'Carthy and Huls 5
The concept of spreading awareness is imperative to
normalizing a stigmatized population, as lack of
infrastructure and monitoring in psychiatric institutions
leaves the public unaware of the aforementioned human
rights violations (P. Hunt & Mesquita, 2006). However, the
notion of education surrounding mental health standards
faces a financial barrier, as this agenda is much more
accessible to countries that are recognized as high income.
Through their research, Drew et al. (2011) identify that the
majority of low-income and middle-income countries were
not adequately equipped to support those needing to access
mental health services.
Violations
Violations of individuals diagnosed with mental health
disorders vary from one culture/country to another. These
violations may be dependent on the cultures of the country
in question or the resources available to those countries. For
instance, more resources are allotted to the treatment of
mental illness in high-income countries than in low-income
countries. In high-income countries, it is ensured that
trained professionals are available to treat individuals
diagnosed with mental illness. To be specific, the income
level of the world based on its Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) is divided in categories. According to the World
Bank, economies are measured by their gross national
income (GNI). According to the 2011 GNI, a lower income
country was considered USD $1,025 or less; a lower
middle-income country was $1,026 to $4,035; an upper
middle-income country was $4,036 to $12,475; and a high-
income country was $12,476 or more (World Bank Data,
2013). High-income countries are often developed
countries; middle-income countries as well as some
developing countries contain emerging markets; and low-
income countries mostly consist of developing countries.
The violation and stigmatization of individuals
diagnosed with mental illness include discrimination
surrounding employment, marriage, parenting, and family
planning; access to health services; sexual violence; access
to housing; entitlement to vote; and access to basic
education (Drew et al., 2011; Vijayalakshmi et al., 2013;
WHO, 2010). While it may be presumed that these
violations are specific to underdeveloped countries, the
inability to marry exists in Bulgaria, Russia, Thailand, and
India. In Switzerland, though known for its neutrality,
applications of nationality can be declined if an individual
struggles with intellectual disabilities. In addition, only
Canada, Ireland, Italy, and Sweden (out of 63 countries
assessed) do not place legal limitations on voting for
individuals with mental illness (WHO, 2010).
The violation of the mentally ill has been reported as
occurring in a variety of settings ranging from home life to
schools, prisons, work environments, and social services
(Drew et al., 2011). The traits of the mental health care
system are regularly identified as inadequate and
emotionally or physically abusive (Cooper, Ssebunnya,
Kigozi, Lund, & Flisher, 2010). Individuals are often
institutionalized for long periods of time without
appropriate cause and are then subjected to conditions that
include violence, substandard nutrition and cleanliness,
torment, unconsented treatment as extensive as
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT; P. Hunt & Mesquita,
2006), loss of dignity (Kogstad, 2009), and sedation as a
control method (Mayers, Keet, Winkler, & Flisher, 2010).
Violations in Zambia have included denial of food,
restriction of movement, poverty due to cost of treatment,
and being brought to hospital in chains or in the company of
armed officials (Mwanza et al., 2011). Treatment can also
fail to involve basic social communication, as some believe
that this would not be helpful to an individual with mental
health concerns (Kogstad, 2009).
While the Cochrane Review highlights the lack of
empirical evidence for the effectiveness of isolation and use
of restraint, these practices, along with sedation, are
frequently implemented within institutions. The review also
references that within the literature, certain qualitative
studies have in fact pointed to negative outcomes. Another
concern that is equal to the use of possibly nonbeneficial
practices is the intent behind the use, as sedation can be
implemented for purposes of control rather than as a means
of support for the individual (Mayers et al., 2010).
Further violations can be witnessed in a number of
different countries. As described by Yamin and Rosenthal
(2005), in Accra, Ghana, 300 mentally ill men were housed
in a space that was built for 50 individuals and were not
provided with treatment. In Hungary, individuals were
administered obsolete medication and kept in beds that
were caged, thereby limiting their movement. In Turkey,
Peru, and Bulgaria, institutions engage in the dangerous
practice of unmodified ECT, which does not utilize
anesthesia.
Certain countries perpetuate human rights violations
due to the lack of appropriate and accessible staffing.
Less than 50% of hospitals in Bangalore, India, have
psychologists available to their patients. Some of these
violations occur due to a long-standing history of
cultural or faith-based practice regarding treatment of the
mentally ill (WHO, 2010). For example, in Somalia, an
individual may be placed in a hollow with hyenas. The
intent is to scare the "dijinns, or evil spirits" from the
person, and therefore the symptoms of mental illness
(WHO, 2010, p. 12). Other faith-based or traditional
practices can involve restriction of movement through
chains or attempts to remove spirits by whipping the
mentally ill person (Doku et al., 2011).
These violations extend to accessing of justice, civil,
and political rights. In England and Wales, a report by
Mind discovered that 60% of individuals with mental
illness who approached police regarding a crime felt that
the authorities did not treat the report with severity. In
certain instances, reports are not documented due to the
6 SAGE Open
belief that individuals with mental illness are unreliable
(WHO, 2010).
Within the population of individuals with mental
disorders, there are subgroups who are at an increased risk
of violation. For example, those of varying ethnicities and
race are more likely to experience prejudice and women are
more likely to be sexually abused and even sterilized
without consent (P. Hunt & Mesquita, 2006). Kastrup
(2011) notes the disparity between mental health support
for those within marginalized populations, as well as the
lack of human rights fulfillment.
In 1993, the slogan "Human Rights Are Women's
Rights" became a prominent message. During the World
Conference on Human Rights in Vienna (Jansen, 2006), it
was agreed that violence against women was considered a
human rights issue. This practice is most notably seen
during times of war, when sexual violence against women
can increase and be used as a tool of war. This violence can
lead to fear or mental health issues that deter women from
being active community members, which further
exacerbates the issue of human rights (Jansen, 2006).
Violations can also be seen within the very institutions that
are meant to support women with mental health issues, such
as in Kosovo, where incidents were reported in which
women were raped in psychiatric institutions while the
violence was witnessed by staff and humanitarian workers
(Yamin & Rosenthal, 2005).
Legislation
Despite the issues of mental health violations documented
in the literature, it has also been observed that significant
legislations are documented pertaining to the treatment of
individuals with disability including those with mental
disorders. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR) encompasses 30 articles; however, no articles
identify the need for rights around mental health concerns,
and only one article (Article 25) alludes to the importance
of social service access (The United Nations, n.d.). Instead,
information about mental health can be found in the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities. As defined here, disabilities include "long term
. . . mental . . . impairments . . . which in interaction with
various barriers may hinder their full and effective
participation in society on an equal basis with others" (The
United Nations, 2006, Article 1).
To ensure that human rights are honored in relation to
mental health, WHO developed the Mental Health and
Human Rights Project, which focuses on mental health
legislation within a global context (WHO, 2006). This project
was supplementary to the United Nations Principles for the
Protection of Persons With Mental Illness and the
Improvement of Mental Health Care, which was established
in 1991 and created a minimum level of human rights
required in mental health practice (WHO, 2005). However,
the principles (known as the Mental Illness [MI] Principles)
have been critiqued as being ineffective and contrary to the
UDHR. It is noted that the MI Principles are not legally
binding and fail to institute any form of international
supervision (Weissbecker, 2009). The UN Secretary-General
stated that they "offer in some cases a lesser degree of
protection than that offered by existing human rights treaties,
for example, with regard to the requirement for prior
informed consent to treatment" (WHO, 2005, p. 14). P. Hunt
and Mesquita (2006) indicate that "several international
human rights instruments allow for exceptional
circumstances in which persons with psychiatric disabilities
can be involuntarily admitted to a hospital or other
designated institution" (p. 344). However, such vague terms
protect the regular occurrence of human rights violations
(Kogstad, 2009). The case of Harry v. Mental Health Review
Board in Australia illustrates an example of improper use of
mental health law to alleviate embarrassment from family or
communities (Freckelton & McGregor, 2010).
These statements call into question the voice of the service
user and whether human rights in regard to mental health are
indeed being honored. This concern is exacerbated by the
fact that individual countries are able to enact their own
regulations, definitions of mental health disorders, and
principles. As a result, more than 40% of countries lack a
mental health policy and more than 30% of countries lack a
mental health program (P. Hunt & Mesquita, 2006). In some
countries such as Zambia, policies exist but are antiquated,
offensive, and based on colonial eras (Mwanza et al., 2011).
The lack of legislation can also be attributed to the use of
traditional and faith-based practices, which often go
unregulated (Doku et al., 2011).
In addition, legislation may be put in place to manipulate
social participation. According to WHO (2005), "In many
countries a diagnosis of personality disorder has been used
against vulnerable groups, especially young women,
whenever they do not conform with the dominant social,
cultural, moral and religious standards" (p. 21). This
method of mental health diagnoses is also used for political
purposes to attribute personality disorders to those who may
be viewed as a nonconformist (WHO, 2005). In addition, in
India, women viewed as oppositional can be branded as
insane (Davar, 2008). To create uniformity among the
concept of mental health, Tarantola (2007) suggests a more
holistic understanding, which would include emotional,
social, and cultural influence and welfare.
While the intention of establishing universal guidelines
such as UDHR, UNCRPD (UN Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities), and MI Principles is important
for those within the government and legislative context, this
does little to provide information to those who are directly
affected. A survey participant from Jordan stated that "the
most important right is my right to have the knowledge of
all of my rights and to be empowered to [confront]
violations against my rights" (Drew et al., 2011, p. 1666).
This right to knowledge relies heavily, however, on the
assumption that the legislation in fact supports those with
Mfoafo-M'Carthy and Huls 7
mental health issues. Uganda's mental health system is an
example of a legislation that is in accordance with
international policy; yet, it is criticized for its perpetuation
of stigmatization and violation of human rights for those
with mental health concerns (Cooper et al., 2010). These
guidelines additionally rely heavily on agreement,
commitment, compliance, and mutual understanding of the
issues of mental health and human rights.
Discussion
Human rights violations not only affect the physical,
psychological, emotional, and spiritual well-being of
service and nonservice recipients with mental disorders but
also significantly influence potential service recipients'
access to mental health services, thereby creating a dynamic
where not receiving any form of treatment or support may
become more desirable (Loo et al., 2010).
Furthermore, culture, religion, and traditional practices
play a role regarding which type of mental health treatment
is sought out by individuals. Some individuals do not
believe that mental illness exists or that only the physical
symptoms need to be addressed (McDaid, Knapp, & Raja,
2008). This view can be partially attributed to lack of
professional and public knowledge, resulting in the
stigmatization of this population.
Absence of resources may be symptomatic of an
overlying cause of lower socioeconomic status. While
dedication to mental health and humane treatment of these
individuals is a noble cause, this may not be feasible in
certain countries. Ethiopia is home to 77 million people but
only 18 psychiatrists, who are all employed in one hospital,
located in the capital city (Alem, Jacobson, & Hanlon,
2008). Even if legislation were put into place, what would
be enforced in the rural areas where individuals are not
receiving formal care? Bruckner et al. (2011) estimate that
239,000 full-time employees would be required in low- and
middle-income countries just to have adequate staffing. A
proposed solution is to increase staff presence and
emphasize community-based care, which would increase
access and honor the human rights of individuals.
According to Yamin and Rosenthal (2005),
From a human rights perspective, people are entitled to live in
and receive care in the community not because it is more
efficient, but because all human beings develop their identities
within social contexts, and have rights to work and study, as
well as be with friends and family. (p. 297)
Research into why human rights violations occur may be
beneficial in creating a comprehensive plan to better ensure
human rights of those with mental health issues. A
psychiatrist in Ghana presents the following dilemma:
. . . people are trying to do their best to help people with
mental illness, but when there is inadequacy and all those
things set in, we don't intentionally try to violate people's
rights. But when you keep someone in the mental hospital and
you can't provide for the person, you then of course, you are
violating that person's rights. (Doku et al., 2011, p. 18)
Furthermore, it is evident that legislation needs to be
created which honors human rights, as there is a clear
disparity between experiences of those with mental health
concerns and the intent of human rights (Kogstad, 2009).
However, it is also clear that these movements be
considered within the contextual framework of culture and
religion. P. Hunt and Mesquita (2006) suggest that
legislation should consider the following when making
decisions surrounding human rights and mental health:
"participation, autonomy, dignity, inclusion, monitoring,
and accountability" (p. 332). In response to this need for
individual voice, the International Diploma on Mental
Health Law was conceived, it comprised of an
interdisciplinary team including service users and aiming to
provide education, awareness, and reform on a country-
wide basis (Drew et al., 2011). The Mental Health and
Poverty Project (MHaPP) is an initiative focusing on the
cyclical nature of poverty and mental health in Ghana,
Zambia, South Africa, and Uganda (Mwanza et al., 2011).
While more integrated, this initiative solely focuses on
African countries, which possibly negates the presence of
human rights violations in more "developed" countries and
creates further stigmatization for a continent that is already
branded by poor global opinion.
Clearly, the prevalent issue of human rights violations in
the context of mental health can no longer be ignored.
However, given the additional factors and barriers of
income status, accessibility, culture, religion, and traditional
practices, it will be a challenge to create an understanding
and enforcement of universal human rights. To completely
dismiss cultural tradition would only contradict another set
of human rights, thereby exchanging one form of violation
for another. Thus, discussion is necessary regarding how
one can balance the rights of traditional or faith-based
practice with the UN's view of human rights.
This therefore creates the need for both advocates and
researchers to continue challenging and embarking on
studies that will improve the lot of the mentally ill. For
progress to enhance mental health treatment in numerous
countries, serious intervention and engagement from
governmental bodies are necessary.
Despite these arguments, one should not lose sight of the
fact that programs have been introduced in the Western
world to improve the treatment of the mentally ill. For
example, the work of Winick and others on therapeutic
jurisprudence has been designed to shift the treatment of the
mentally ill from the medical model to a more collaborative
approach. This shift in direction commenced in the 1980s as
an interdisciplinary scholarly approach to enhance the
treatment of the mentally ill (Winick, 2002, 2006). Since
then, a number of interventions have been introduced in the
treatment of the seriously mentally ill in the Western world,
8 SAGE Open
including Community Treatment Orders (CTOs) or
Mandated Outpatient Treatment which legally compels
individuals diagnosed with mental illness to follow through
with a proposed treatment or else risk being hospitalized
(A. M. Hunt, da Silva, Lurie, & Goldbloom, 2007; Kisely,
Campbell, Scott, Preston, & Xiao, 2007; Mfoafo-M'Carthy
& Williams, 2010).
In addition, it should be noted that the study adds to the
literature on issues of human rights abuses of the mentally
ill and contributes to the discourse. Also, it continues to
bring attention to the stigmatization of the mentally ill and
the need for more education and understanding of the needs
of this marginalized community.
Limitation
This review may not be considered exhaustive due to the
fact that the literature reviewed were only English language
articles, this eliminates the cross-cultural perception of the
study as articles in other languages were excluded. Also, all
the articles reviewed focused solely on Westernized
perception or definition of mental illness, which does not
enhance the diversity of the discourse.
Conclusion
Based on the findings of this review, the literature clearly
articulates the importance of creating a system that will
curtail the marginalization and stigmatization of individuals
diagnosed with mental disorders. The review identified
legislations intended to limit the human rights violations of
individuals with mental health issues, yet not much has
been achieved. Even in the Western world, programs
including the work of Winick on therapeutic jurisprudence
and other treatment options such as CTOs aimed at
enhancing treatment to limit mental health violations have
not made a significant impact. A major factor to improving
the conditions of the marginalized is to curb violations
against the mentally ill through meaningful engagement and
political will on the part of governments. The observation is
that, despite laws governing the treatment of those with
mental health issues, much has not been done to address
stigmatization of individuals diagnosed with serious mental
illness. In developing countries and other parts of the world,
family members with mental health issues continue to be
marginalized, medicalized, and ostracized, hence exposing
them to human right abuses.
