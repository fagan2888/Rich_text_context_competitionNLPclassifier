BACKGROUND. Data from the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA)
Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) of patients enrolled in managed care
services through Medicare were analyzed. The MHOS provided baseline estimates
of quality of life of cancer survivors in comparison to a frequency age-matched
cohort of noncancer patients.
METHOD. In 1998, the MHOS was mailed to a random sample of 279,135 benefi-
ciaries. Completed surveys were received from 167,096 respondents (60%). Some
22,747 respondents who had been diagnosed with cancer were frequency age
matched to an equal number of noncancer patients.
RESULTS. Cancer survivors had statistically significantly poorer scores than non-
cancer patients on all eight subscales as well as on the Physical Component and
Mental Component summary measures of the Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form-36 (MOS SF-36). Comparisons by type and number of cancers for which an
individual was currently in treatment showed lowest quality of life for those in
treatment for lung carcinoma, followed by those who were in treatment for more
than one type of cancer.
CONCLUSION. The data suggest that cancer shows negative effects on health-related
quality of life that are not explainable by simple effects of age because frequency
age-matched cancer survivors had statistically significantly lower scores on all 10
scores of the MOS SF-36. Effect sizes are evaluated to determine the clinical
significance of these differences in health-related quality of life. The MHOS offers
useful data for planning and improving cancer policy and programs. Cancer 2003;

Cancer occurs later in life, with nearly 80% of all cancers diagnosed
among individuals at 55 years and older.1 Currently, cancer is the
second leading cause of death in the United States.1 However, due to
improvements in prevention, early detection, and treatment, cancer
death rates for all sites combined decreased an average of 0.6% per
year from 1990 to 1996.2 There are an estimated 8.9 million cancer
survivors in the United States.3 The term "cancer survivor" is defined
in several ways. The traditional National Institutes of Health defini-
tion of a cancer survivor was someone who had survived cancer for 5
years and was disease free. The American Cancer Society (ACS) has
adopted a broader definition of a cancer survivor. Its definition in-
cludes people from the time of their diagnosis with cancer and for the
balance of their lives, a definition that has been used by the National
674
Published 2003 by the American Cancer Society*
Coalition for Cancer Survivorship for a number of
years.4 This is the definition used in this article.
The ACS has issued three cancer challenge goals
for the year 2015, which include decreasing incidence
and mortality due to cancer. Recognizing that cancer
and its treatment may result in physical impairments
as well as psychosocial losses, these goals also include
improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
of cancer survivors.5 Attempting to achieve any of
these three goals poses formidable difficulties. How-
ever, unlike incidence and mortality, quality of life has
the additional problem of lacking a commonly agreed
upon standard of measurement for assessing the cur-
rent status of this variable and any progress that is
made in improving it.
Over the past two decades, increased attention
has been given to developing HRQOL as an operation-
ally defined patient-report based measure, and HRQOL
has become a standard outcome measure in cancer
clinical trials.6,7 Recognition of the need to include
HRQOL as part of population-based assessments of
health status has also increased. The ACS is beginning
to conduct its own population-based studies of the
HRQOL, psychosocial adaptation, and changing needs
of cancer survivors. However, this will take time, and
data are needed now to use as a guide for program
development. The available data on the HRQOL of
cancer survivors are provided by relatively small op-
portunistic samples. Because of the difficulties of sep-
arating the effects of cancer on HRQOL from effects
that are due to comorbid conditions and other life
changes, additional data on a comparable sample of
noncancer patients are needed for comparison.
The available data comparing the quality of life of
cancer survivors with individuals who have never had
cancer show little difference. A Canadian study8 com-
pared the HRQOL of breast carcinoma survivors 8
years after diagnosis. In that study, fewer cancer sur-
vivors reported positive quality of life than similarly
aged controls, but these differences were small and
nonsignificant. Another Canadian study9 compared
index cancer cases with neighborhood controls of a
similar age and gender. The quality of life of the cancer
survivors was found to be similar to the neighborhood
controls. A French population-based case­control
study found that testicular carcinoma survivors with a
mean follow-up of 11 years did not differ significantly
in HRQOL from controls.10 A Swedish study11 compar-
ing HRQOL in long-term head and neck carcinoma
survivors with general population norms showed no
significant differences except on the role-physical
scale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36
(MOS SF-36). These studies did not include U.S. sam-
ples and were limited in sample size. This article com-
pares cancer survivors with noncancer patients in a
reasonably large sample of respondents.
In April 1999, the ACS hosted a conference in
Arlington, VA, to bring together major government
agencies to identify possible collaborations and to
share information on how each was attempting to
measure the HRQOL of various populations. This ar-
ticle is the result of a successful collaboration initiated
at that meeting, i.e., a collaboration between the ACS
and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA;
recently renamed the Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services). The collaboration led to an analysis of
data from the 1998 Medicare Health Outcomes Survey
(MHOS) of patients receiving managed care services
through Medicare. This analysis compared the
HRQOL responses of cancer survivors with those of
frequency age-matched respondents who were not
cancer survivors, using the definition of cancer survi-
vor as any person who is living after a diagnosis of
cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Survey Instrument
The MHOS was developed by the National Committee
for Quality Assurance (NCQA) under contract to HCFA
to measure the outcomes of care provided by Medi-
care  Choice organizations to Medicare beneficiaries
enrolled in these health plans. This performance mea-
sure was included in the 1998 Health Plan Employer
Data and Information Set (HEDIS 3.0) for Medicare. A
technical expert panel of representatives from health
plans, health services researchers, and clinicians as-
sisted in the development of the tool.12 Originally
called the Health of Seniors survey and later renamed
the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey, the MHOS
included a 95-item core and a five-item variable mod-
ule.
Measures
The core instrument included a measure of HRQOL
and questions to collect demographic information.
The HRQOL measure was the MOS SF-36, a 36-item
well tested, valid, and reliable self-report tool that has
been used in hundreds of studies world-wide to mea-
sure HRQOL.13
The eight scales of the MOS SF-36 include the
following:
1. Physical functioning (PF). Ten questions that ask
the extent to which health limits the performance
of physical activities.
2. Role-physical (RP). Four questions that ask indi-
viduals the extent to which their physical health
Quality of Life of Cancer Patients/Baker et al. 675
limits them in their work or other usual activities
in terms of time and performance.
3. Bodily pain (BP). Two questions that ask individ-
uals about the severity of their pain and the extent
to which pain interferes with normal work, includ-
ing work outside the home and housework.
4. General health (GH). Five questions that ask indi-
viduals to rate their current health status overall,
their susceptibility to disease, and their expecta-
tions for health in the future.
5. Vitality (VT). Four questions that ask individuals to
rate subjective well-being in terms of energy and
fatigue.
6. Social functioning (SF). Two questions that ask
individuals about limitations in normal social
functioning due specifically to health.
7. Role-emotional (RE). Three questions that ask
whether emotional problems have interfered with
accomplishments at work or other usual activities
in terms of time as well as performance.
8. Mental health (MH). Five questions that ask how
frequently the respondent experiences feelings re-
lated to anxiety, depression, loss of behavioral or
emotional control, and psychological well-being.
These eight scales provide the basis for calculating
two summary measures, the Physical Component
Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary
(MCS). One additional question that asks the respon-
dents to rate their general health compared to one
year ago is also included but is not used in calculating
the two summary measure scores. The MOS SF-36 is
scored so that higher scores represent better function-
ing on both the two summary measures and on all
eight subscales. Norm based scaling is used so that
scores are standardized using normative values for the
general U.S. population. A score of 50 represents the
national average for both the summary scores and for
the subscales. A score that is 10 points above or below
the mean score of 50 represents a difference of 1
standard deviation from the national average.
Procedures
The survey was sent to a random sample of 1,000
Medicare beneficiaries continuously enrolled for at
least six months in each plan with a Medicare contract
in place on or before January 1, 1997. In plans with
1,000 or fewer Medicare enrollees, all eligible mem-
bers were surveyed. The sampling frame included the
aged and the disabled but excluded those eligible for
Medicare because of end stage renal disease, since
these patients are not eligible to enroll in a managed-
care plan. To ensure the validity and reliability of the
data collected, plans were instructed to contract with
one of six NCQA-certified vendors for administration
of the survey. The survey was administered to the first
cohort at baseline (May 1998) and again to the same
cohort in spring 2000. A new cohort will be selected
each year for baseline measurement.
Cohort 1 data collection began in May 1998 and
included 279,135 beneficiaries enrolled in 268 man-
aged care plans covering 287 market areas. Completed
surveys were received from 167,096 respondents, a
raw response rate of 60%. Data files were aggregated
by NCQA and forwarded to HCFA's data cleaning,
analysis, and dissemination contractor, the Health
Services Advisory Group Health Outcomes Team. An
analytic data set was created that merged plan char-
acteristics from HCFA administrative data files with
the survey response data and patient demographic
and entitlement information from the Medicare En-
rollment Data Base. This augmented file was delivered
to HCFA in November 1998.
For purposes of this study, two separate files were
created from the MHOS Cohort 1 final data set. The
first file consisted of all respondents who answered
positively when asked if a physician had ever told
them that they had any cancer other than skin carci-
noma (Q33). This yielded 22,747 unique respondents
whom we defined as cancer survivors using the ACS
definition of a cancer survivor as anyone still living
after a cancer diagnosis.
The second data set created was a file of respon-
dents who indicated that no physician had ever told
them that they had cancer other than skin carcinoma.
A frequency age-matched sample of noncancer pa-
tients was randomly selected for inclusion in the an-
alytic data set using 13 age categories: 29 or younger,
30­39, 40­49, 50­59, 60­64, 65­69, 70­74, 75­79, 80­
84, 85­89, 90­94, 95­99, and 100 years or older. We
used a frequency age-matched cohort analytic ap-
proach to better assess differences between cancer
survivors and those who had never been diagnosed
with cancer.
Data Analysis
Both for those who were cancer survivors and those
who were not, only individuals whose Medicare enti-
tlement was based on being aged 65 or older were
included in the analyses. Individuals younger than 65
(whose entitlement was based on a disability) were
not included. A single SAS data file including all indi-
viduals who met these criteria (n  43,757) was cre-
ated for use in the analyses. One-way and two-way
analyses of variance performed in PROC GLM were
used to compare mean MOS SF-36 standardized
scores. Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD)
tests were used in post hoc testing. Chi-square tests in
676 CANCER February 1, 2003 / Volume 97 / Number 3
PROC FREQ were used for demographic comparisons.
Multiple linear regression analyses to test for indepen-
dent predictors of MOS SF-36 subscale and summary
scores were performed in PROC REG.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents data on sample characteristics. Both
the cancer survivors and those who did not report
having been diagnosed with any cancer other than
skin carcinoma (hereafter referred to as the no-cancer
group or noncancer subjects) were equally divided
between the elderly (65­74 years old) and the older
elderly (75 years and older). Both groups had a some-
what higher percentage of female than male respon-
dents and were predominately white and non-His-
panic. The majority of individuals in both groups were
currently married and about 30% in each group were
widowed. About 30% of both groups had less than a
high school education, and 34.4% of each group re-
ported graduation from high school as their highest
educational attainment. Less than one-fifth in each
group reported an annual household income of less
than $10,000, whereas less than one-third of each
group reported an annual household income of
$10,000­$19,999. Among the cancer survivors, 11.8%,
5.4%, 3.0%, and 16.7%, respectively, reported currently
being in treatment for breast, colorectal, lung, or pros-
tate carcinoma only. An additional 2.1% reported be-
ing in treatment for more than one of these four
cancers.
Table 2 presents mean scores for the two sum-
mary measures and for the eight subscales of the MOS
SF-36 by cancer status (cancer survivor or no-cancer
group) and by age group (65­74 and 75 or older). For
the entire sample and within each age group, cancer
survivors had significantly lower mean scores on all 10
scales than did the noncancer subjects (all P  0.001).
As would be expected, individuals aged 65­74 had
significantly higher mean scores than those aged 75
and older.
Effect size, which refers to the strength of a rela-
tionship in a population or the degree of departure
from a null hypothesis, offers a way to judge the clin-
ical or practical importance of a result.14 Using a SD of
10, it was determined that effect sizes were small (de-
fined as 0.2­0.4) for PC, PF, RP, GH, VT, and SF scales,
with a range of 0.22­0.30, corresponding to score dif-
ferences of 2.2­3.0 points. The remaining four scales--
MC, BP, RE, and MH--had effect sizes less than 0.2.
Although four, the differences were statistically signif-
icant for these four scales, they are not practically
significant, as judged by the magnitude of the effect.
Multiple linear regressions showed that having
been diagnosed with cancer was still a significant pre-
dictor of MOS SF-36 summary and subscale scores
even after the effects of a number of other variables
were taken into account. Variables for inclusion in the
regression models were selected based on a technical
report prepared for the HCFA and NCQA.15 Nonmed-
ical variables included in the models were age (in
years), gender, race (white/nonwhite), Hispanic eth-

the models included the following medical conditions:
hypertension; angina or coronary artery disease; con-
gestive heart failure; myocardial infarction; stroke;
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema,
or asthma; Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or irritable
bowel disease; arthritis of the hand or wrist; arthritis of
the hip or knee; sciatica; and diabetes.
Table 3 shows regression results for variables that
were significant in the multiple linear regression mod-
els for the PCS and MH. Results for these two scales
are presented because they are typical of those for all
10 scales with respect to the relative sizes of the esti-
mated betas for cancer compared with those for other
variables that were also significant in the models. In
addition, the betas for cancer for these two scales
represent the range of betas for cancer over the 10
scales (from 0.777 to 2.573) because they are the
smallest (0.777) and one of the largest (1.979).
To investigate the effect of current treatment for
cancer on MOS SF-36 mean scores, subjects were as-
signed to one of seven groups: no cancer (n  22,072);

cancer not currently in treatment for breast, colorec-
tal, lung, or prostate carcinoma; in treatment for pros-
tate carcinoma only; in treatment for breast carci-
noma only; in treatment for colorectal carcinoma
only; in treatment for more than one cancer; and in
treatment for lung carcinoma only. For all 10 scales,
those currently in treatment for lung carcinoma only
or for more than one cancer had significantly lower
mean scores than any of the other five groups. Those
who had not been diagnosed with cancer had the
highest mean score on all 10 scales and their mean for
each scale was significantly higher than the means for
any of the five in treatment groups except the group in
treatment for prostate carcinoma only (which differed
significantly from noncancer subjects on 5 of the 10
scales). Mean scores for those in treatment for breast
carcinoma only or for colorectal carcinoma only were
consistently lower than the means for those being
treated for prostate carcinoma only and were consis-
tently higher than means for those being treated for
lung carcinoma only or for more than one of the four
listed cancers.
Although the effect sizes for the overall cancer
group compared with the noncancer group were small
or nonexistent, larger effect sizes were found when
using the treatment groups described above for com-
parison to the noncancer group. For example, the
effect size for GHS for those currently in treatment for
colorectal carcinoma was 0.55 (moderate) and the ef-
fect size for PCS for those currently in treatment for
lung carcinoma was 1.02 (large), corresponding to
score differences of 5.5 and 10.2 points. The effect
sizes can be summarized as follows for each treatment
group compared with the noncancer group: currently
not in treatment for breast, colorectal, prostate, or
lung carcinoma; 0.03­0.19 (no effect for all scales); in
treatment for prostate carcinoma only, 0.05­0.34 (no
effect except small effect for GHS and RPS); in treat-
ment for breast carcinoma only, 0.17­0.39 (small ef-
fects for all except MCS and MHS); in treatment for
colorectal carcinoma only, 0.27­0.55 (small effects for
all except GHS and SFS, which were moderate); in
treatment for more than one of the four cancers, 0.48­
0.90 (large effects for GHS and SFS, moderate for all
others except BPS, which was small); and in treatment
for lung carcinoma only, 0.52­1.15 (large effects for
PCS, PFS, RFS, GHS, VTS, and SFS, moderate for all
others).

Quality of Life of Cancer Patients/Baker et al. 679
survivors who completed the MOS SF-36 as part of the
MHOS with that of a frequency age-matched sample
of noncancer MHOS respondents. No claim is made
that this sample of managed care recipients in the
Medicare program is representative of the Medicare
population. However, this data set provides informa-
tion on a large sample of people 65 and older who
have access to care through Medicare, some of whom
have received a diagnosis of cancer at some point in
their lives, and on an age-comparable group who have
not been diagnosed with cancer.
As a basis for examining the quality of life of
cancer survivors, the MOS SF-36 has a number of
strong practical advantages. Among its strengths is its
applicability to many disease groups as well as the
general population, so that it can be used to make
comparisons between cancer patients and patients
with other diseases as well as healthy populations.
Since most studies of the quality of life of cancer
survivors lack either a non-cancer control group or
broad normative data on non-cancer patients against
which to compare findings, this is a very important
advantage in attempting to sort out the contribution
of cancer and cancer treatment to differences in qual-
ity of life versus the effects of comorbitidites and nat-
ural aging.
Research documents the responsiveness of the
scales and summary scores of the MOS SF-36 to vari-
ous treatment interventions.16 Findings indicate that
small absolute differences in scores are clinically
meaningful. For instance, a study documented that
untreated asthmatics reported a PCS score 3.7 points
lower than asthmatics treated with drugs. Another
showed that people suffering from a migraine head-
aches reported an increase in PCS score of 2.09 points
when their headache was treated. Therefore, the dif-
ference in mean physical functioning between cancer
survivors in our study (mean PCS score  38.5) and in
the noncancer group (mean PCS score  41.2) can be
likened to the increase in physical limitations experi-
enced when suffering from untreated migraine head-
ache, which is clinically meaningful. Clinical signifi-
cance of the differences found in our study is also
evidenced by the effect sizes seen, especially with
regard to the impact of treatment status on HRQOL.
Our data show that cancer patients have statisti-
cally significantly poorer quality of life than noncancer
respondents as measured by all eight subscales of the
MOS SF-36 and the two summary measures even after
considering the effects of other variables. These dif-
ferences in HRQOL, however, represented small ef-
fects for five of the eight MOS SF-36 subscales. Of the
summary measures, only the PCS showed a small ef-
fect. The effect size for MCS did not indicate any
practical significance. These data support the view
that cancer is a uniquely traumatizing event, produc-
ing broad negative impact on a variety of dimensions
of a survivor's HRQOL.
Secondary analysis of data collected for broader
purposes can limit the questions one can ask of these
data. One limitation of this data is the absence of
information on the time since cancer diagnosis. Al-
though these data do not allow clear analysis by stage
of recovery, there is evidence in these results that
patients who have access to care through Medicare
managed care continue to have serious biomedical
and psychosocial HRQOL problems. This should re-
ceive further attention, particularly as these quality-
of-life dimensions are significantly worse for the can-
cer survivors than for same-age controls who have not
had to deal with the physical and psychosocial se-
quelae of cancer.
These data also allow a comparison by type and
number of cancers for which a subject is currently
being treated. Analyses were made across the condi-
tion of having no cancer; having a cancer diagnosis
but not in treatment for breast, colorectal, lung, or
prostate carcinoma; or in treatment for one or more of
these four common types of cancer. As these analyses
show, those who had not been diagnosed with cancer
had statistically significantly higher HRQOL scores. In
contrast to the small effects found when comparing
cancer survivors overall with the noncancer group,
larger effects were found when the comparisons were
made across treatment status. Being in treatment for
lung carcinoma only or in treatment for more than
one type of cancer had the most negative effect on
quality of life. The general pattern showed the highest
MOS SF-36 scores for individuals without cancer, fol-
lowed by those not in treatment for breast, colorectal,
lung, or prostate carcinoma; only prostate in treat-
ment; only breast in treatment; only colorectal in
treatment; treatment for more than one type of can-
cer; and only lung in treatment. For all 10 MOS SF-36
scales, being in treatment either for lung carcinoma
only or for more than one type of cancer resulted in
statistically significantly poorer HRQOL. Moderate or
large effects were found for all 10 MOS SF-36 scores
when comparing those in treatment for lung carci-
noma only with the noncancer group. For those in
treatment for more than one of the four cancers, mod-
erate or large effects were found for all 10 MOS SF-36
scales except for the BPS, which showed a small effect.
These data show that the severity and range of effects
of particular types of cancer and the varied treatments
offered for various cancer sites produce different ef-
fects on HRQOL. However, the development of several
malignancies is particularly difficult for patients. Hav-

ing to fight cancer on several different fronts poses a
cascade of complex HRQOL challenges.
Previous studies employing the MOS SF-36 have
found that older age groups (particularly 75 and older)
show lower scores on the eight scales of the MOS
SF-36.17,18 Consistent with these earlier findings, the
75 and older group in this study had significantly
lower scores than the 65­74 group on all 10 scales. It is
noteworthy that even in the 75 and above age group,
those with a cancer history continued to have signifi-
cantly lower scores than the noncancer group.
There are some limitations to using the MOS
SF-36 to describe the HRQOL of cancer patients. Its
strength in being a generic measure that can be used
to assess functional outcomes across many medical
conditions, both acute and chronic, as well as with
healthy populations, also provides a limitation. It does
not include data on domains that measure the specific
effects of particular diseases such as cancer and its
various treatments. Therefore, it does not reveal as
much as one might like in terms of well delineated
areas for intervention.
However, the MOS SF-36 as it is included in the
MHOS offers important and relevant data for those
concerned with planning, evaluating, and improving
cancer policy and programs. Because the MHOS was
repeated again after 2 years with this 1998 cohort,
when data are available for analysis, changes in scores
may also reveal patterns of interest to program plan-
ners. Furthermore, the continued administration of
the MHOS to new cohorts each year will provide data
that may be useful in tracking changes in HRQOL
related to the efforts of the ACS and its partners to
improve the quality of life of cancer survivors over the
next 15 years.
