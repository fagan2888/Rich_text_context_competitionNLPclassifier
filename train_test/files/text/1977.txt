Medical Research Institute Survey

Abstract
Background: Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) is associated with increased risk of respiratory illness, cancer, and
cardiovascular disease. Prior to smoking bans on airlines in the late 1980s, flight attendants were exposed to a
significant amount of SHS. In the present study, we examine associations between flight attendant SHS exposure
and development of respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.
Methods: Between December 2006 and October 2010, three hundred sixty-two flight attendants completed an
online questionnaire with information regarding experience as a flight attendant, medical history, smoking history,
and SHS exposure. Rates of illnesses in flight attendants were compared with an age and smoking history matched
population sample from NHANES 2005-2006. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of
reported medical conditions and pre-ban years of exposure.
Results: Compared with the sample from NHANES 2005-2006, flight attendants had increased prevalence of
chronic bronchitis (11.7% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.05), emphysema/COPD (3.2% vs. 0.9%, p < 0.03), and sinus problems
(31.5% vs. 20.9%, p < 0.002), despite a lower prevalence of medical illnesses including high blood pressure,
diabetes, high cholesterol, heart failure, cancer, and thyroid disease. Amongst flight attendants who reported never
smoking over their lifetimes, there was not a significant association between years of service as a flight attendant
in the pre-smoking ban era and illnesses. However, in this same group, there was a significantly increased risk of
daily symptoms (vs. no symptoms) of nasal congestion, throat, or eye irritation per 10-year increase of years of
service as a flight attendant prior to the smoking ban (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.41 - 3.24).
Conclusions: Flight attendants experience increased rates of respiratory illnesses compared to a population
sample. The frequency of symptoms of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation is associated with occupational
SHS exposure in the pre-smoking ban era.
Background
Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) is associated with
increased risk of respiratory illness, cancer, and cardio-
vascular disease [1]. Importantly, SHS exposure is asso-
ciated with increased risk of death due to cardiovascular
disease of approximately 30% [1-4] and increased risk of
lung cancer of 20-30%[1]. Occupational exposure to
SHS is common [5,6] and the level of exposure may
even exceed exposure related to home-based SHS [5].
Numerous public health measures have been instituted
to limit occupational and public exposure to SHS. Evi-
dence regarding adverse consequences of occupational
exposure to SHS continues to be collected.
One population with a history of occupational SHS
exposure is flight attendants. Beginning in 1988, smok-
ing bans on flights originating from the United States
(US) were gradually introduced [7]. On October 31,
1989, the US Congress voted to ban smoking on all

domestic flights, and this ban went into effect on Febru-
ary 25th 1990. Smoking was banned on international
flights to and from the US in 1996. Prior to the institu-
tion of these smoking bans, it was estimated that flight
attendants were exposed to approximately six times the
SHS of ground-based workers and fourteen times the
SHS of a typical person [8].
Flight attendants reported increased physical symp-
toms (ocular and nasal irritation, respiratory symptoms)
associated with the cabin environment [9]. However, in
pre-smoking ban studies, it was not consistently clear
whether these symptoms were related to the overall
cabin environment or due to the effects of SHS [10].
Some individual studies suggested that symptoms of eye
and nose irritation were associated with in-flight smoke
exposure [11,12]. While these investigations focused on
short-term symptoms related to SHS exposure in the air
cabin, there are suggestions that cabin SHS exposure
also has long-term effects. It has been reported that
increased number of hours in a smoky cabin was asso-
ciated with increased sinusitis, middle ear infections,
and asthma over the lifetime of flight attendants [13].
Never-smoking flight attendants working prior to the
smoking ban have been shown to have airway obstruc-
tion and impaired diffusing capacity on pulmonary func-
tion testing [14]. In addition, amongst flight attendants,
the highest levels of secondhand smoke exposure were
associated with increased rates of hypertension [15].
While the existing evidence suggests a relationship
between flight attendant SHS exposure and development
of illness, debate persists, in part due to efforts by the
tobacco industry to diminish the perception of negative
effects of SHS [16,17]. In the present study, we seek to
evaluate associations between flight attendant second-
hand smoke exposure and lifetime development of
respiratory symptoms, respiratory illnesses, and cardio-
vascular disease.
Methods
Between December 2006 and October 2010, 362 flight
attendants were recruited via newsletters, brochures,
newspaper, and internet advertisements to complete a
questionnaire online (http://www.imenet.net/UCSF-
Quest/) or at a visit to the Flight Attendant Medical
Research Institute (FAMRI) clinic at the University of
California, San Francisco. Even if the flight attendants
were unable to visit the FAMRI clinic, flight atten-
dants who flew while smoking was permitted in air
cabins were invited to fill out the questionnaire to
study risk for diseases related to occupational second-
hand smoke exposure. Questionnaire items included
demographics, flight attendant occupational history,
medical history, symptoms of illness, smoking history,
and SHS exposure. The study was approved by the
University of California, San Francisco Institutional
Review Board.
Questionnaire
Flight attendant occupational history included dates
worked as a full-time and/or part-time flight attendant,
cabin sections worked, and domestic/international
routes. Other occupational history was also queried.
Medical history was assessed by asking the respondent
"Has a doctor ever diagnosed any of the following medi-
cal problems?" to a list of common cardiovascular con-
ditions, respiratory illnesses, and cancer with response
for year first diagnosed, and year of most recent worsen-
ing or event. Chest pain was assessed with the question
"Do you ever experience chest pain or discomfort with
exertion?" and shortness of breath was assessed with
"Do you ever experience shortness of breath?" Symp-
toms of cough and upper respiratory symptoms were
assessed by frequency of symptoms without reference to
date of onset of symptoms. Personal smoking history
was defined as at least 1 cigarette per day and a total of
100 cigarettes in the respondent's lifetime and further
evaluated with questions regarding current and prior
smoking including ages started and stopped smoking
regularly, number of cigarettes smoked per day (if cur-
rent smoker), and number of cigarettes smoked per day
when smoking at heaviest. SHS exposure was ascer-
tained by asking about childhood exposures, exposure in
the home, exposure outside of the home, and exposure
in the workplace. Assessment of smoke exposure
included years of exposure and average hours per day
that the participant had seen or smelled smoke in each
environment.
Comparison of FAMRI participants with NHANES sample
Participants from the FAMRI questionnaire were com-
pared with data publicly available from participants
from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 examination [18].
NHANES questionnaires were administered by
NHANES staff. The majority of NHANES questions
were similar to FAMRI questionnaire questions (see
Additional File 1). For determination of medical history,
respondents were asked "Have you ever been told by a
doctor or other health professional that you had" fol-
lowed by the specific medical condition. For sinus pro-
blems, the NHANES question differed from FAMRI and
asked "During the past 12 months, did a doctor or other
health professional tell you that you have a sinus infec-
tion?" Questions regarding symptoms of chest pain and
shortness of breath differed slightly in NHANES with
questions of "Have you ever had any pain or discomfort
in your chest?" and "Have you had shortness of breath
either when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight

hill?" Smoking history in NHANES was defined as at
least 100 cigarettes in the participant's lifetime. An
NHANES sample was generated by restricting the popu-
lation to those who were female, over the age of 18, and
with a high-school education or greater. The sample
was frequency-matched for age and personal smoking
history (i.e., previous smoker or not and current smok-
ing status). Comparisons between FAMRI and NHANES
participants were performed using the chi-square test,
and the 2-sided Fisher-exact test for less prevalent con-
ditions (Congestive Heart Failure and Emphysema/
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).
Definition of pre- and post-ban service as a flight
attendant
Number of years of flight attendant smoke exposure was
quantified by defining pre- and post- ban service. Flight
attendants recorded the starting and ending month and
year of service and reported whether the majority of
their flight routes were domestic or international. For
flight attendants who flew domestically, April 23, 1988
was defined as the date before which flight attendants
had in-flight smoke exposure, since this was the date
smoking bans went into effect for the majority of US
domestic routes. For flight attendants who flew interna-
tionally, January 1, 1995 was used as the date before
which flight attendants had in-flight smoke exposure,
since this was the date of the first US airlines to ban
smoking on international flights. Consideration was not
made for cabin chamber worked (i.e., first class, coach),
as this has not been demonstrated to have a significant
effect on SHS exposure amongst flight attendants [12].
Association of reported medical conditions with service
as a flight attendant
Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the asso-
ciation of reported medical conditions and pre-ban years of
exposure. Analysis was restricted to flight attendants who
reported having never smoked (n = 235). Odds ratios (OR)
of reported medical conditions (yes/no) for each decade
(10-year increase) in years of pre-ban service were esti-
mated. This duration of service was selected since most
respondents were career flight attendants. OR were age-
adjusted if particular medical conditions were associated
with age (e.g., hypertension). OR of reported medical con-
ditions for each per-decade increase in post-ban years and
total years as a flight attendant were also estimated.
Association of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation
(ENT) with service as a flight attendant
A subset of the 362 participants (n = 328) reported fre-
quency of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation (ENT
symptoms). Multinomial logistic regression was used to
examine the association of ENT symptoms and pre-ban
years of exposure. OR of the associations between differ-
ing levels of ENT symptom frequency (daily, weekly/
monthly, and less than monthly) vs. no symptoms, for
every decade of pre-ban exposure, were obtained. Analy-
sis was restricted to participants who reported ENT
symptom frequency among those who reported having
never smoked (n = 226 of 235). Based on availability of
data where participants reported their non-occupational
SHS exposure, models were adjusted for age, living with
a smoker as an adult (n reporting any answer to this
questionnaire item = 218 of 226), living with a smoker as
a child (n = 197 of 226), and maternal exposure during
pregnancy (n = 187 of 226). Additionally, analyses were
performed to assess the associations of reported medical
conditions and ENT symptom frequency with post-ban
years and total years as a flight attendant.
Analyses were carried out with SAS version 9.1.3 and
Stata version 7. Figures were created using R-software
version 2.4.1.
Results
Three hundred sixty-two flight attendants participated
in the FAMRI questionnaire. Mean age amongst partici-
pants was 58.2 (interquartile range (IQR) 53-65).
Amongst FAMRI participants, 116 (33.0%) had a perso-
nal history of smoking (>100 cigarettes in lifetime).
Three hundred fourteen participants worked full-time in
the pre-smoking ban era (median 16.9 years, IQR 9.0-
23.8 years) with 8 participants working part-time in the
pre-ban era (median 4.7 years, IQR 3.4-5.5 years). Two
hundred eighty-two participants worked full time in the
post-smoking ban era (median 14.1 years, IQR 9.2-15.2
years) with 19 participants working part-time (median
5.7 years, IQR 1.4-10.1 years). Of the participants, 76
worked exclusively in the pre-ban era, 46 worked exclu-
sively post-ban, and 240 worked in both eras.
Comparison of FAMRI participants with NHANES sample
Compared to an age and smoking history matched sam-
ple from NHANES 2005-2006 (Table 1), FAMRI partici-
pants had lower prevalence of high blood pressure,
diabetes, high cholesterol, heart failure, cancer, thyroid
disease, and chest pain. There was no statistically signifi-
cant difference between NHANES and FAMRI partici-
pants for ischemic heart disease, asthma, sleep apnea,
breast cancer, and shortness of breath. However, FAMRI
participants had significantly increased prevalence of
chronic bronchitis, emphysema/chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), and sinus problems.

attendant (Table 2) were determined in participants
without a personal history of smoking (N = 235). Con-
ditions associated with age (high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, chronic bronchitis, chest pain, and short-
ness of breath) were adjusted for age. There was no
significant difference in the odds of high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, asthma, chronic bronchitis,
sinus problems, ear infections, shortness of breath or
chest pain with respect to duration of pre-smoking ban
service.
Analyses did not show significant associations of
reported medical conditions with per-decade increase in
post-ban years or total years as a flight attendant. How-
ever, there was a non-significant trend of increased
sinus problems and ear infections, respectively, with
total years of service (Table 3).
Association of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation
(ENT) with service as a flight attendant
Three hundred twenty-eight of three hundred sixty-two
FAMRI participants described frequency of symptoms of
nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation (ENT) not
related to a cold or hay fever. Of these respondents, 71
(21.6%) reported daily symptoms, 62 (18.9%) reported
weekly or monthly symptoms, 93 (28.4%) reported less
than monthly symptoms, and 102 (31.1%) reported
never experiencing symptoms (Table 1). A similar distri-
bution of ENT symptom frequency occurred for those
participants who reported never having smoked. Analy-
sis of symptom frequency amongst flight attendants
reporting no personal history of smoking revealed a sig-
nificantly higher risk of daily symptoms vs. no symp-
toms per decade of pre-ban service (OR 2.14, 95% CI

questionnaires between December 2006 and October 2010. Each medical condition represents a lifetime history of diagnosis of that condition, without reference
to current vs. past conditions. Chi-square test was performed for comparisons between groups, with the exception of the conditions marked with (**) which were
compared using the two-sided Fisher exact test. () Percentages of frequency of nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation were determined using the total

greater frequency of symptoms and years of post-ban
service or total years of service. Adjustment for age, liv-
ing with a smoker as an adult, and living with a smoker
as a child did not attenuate this association. Adjustment
for maternal exposure to smoke during pregnancy
slightly attenuated the association (OR 1.65, 95% CI
0.90-3.02).
Discussion
This questionnaire-based study of flight attendant occu-
pational SHS exposure and medical illnesses provides
several observations about the overall health of flight
attendants and the relationship between illness and SHS
exposure as a flight attendant. Compared with an age
and smoking history matched population sample from
NHANES 2005-2006, flight attendants are generally
healthier than the US population with respect to most
common illnesses. However, for many respiratory ill-
nesses including chronic bronchitis, emphysema/COPD,
and sinus problems, flight attendants exposed to SHS
have an increased prevalence of disease. This suggests
that exposures related to being a flight attendant may
promote the development of respiratory illness. We did
not find that years of pre-smoking ban service as a flight
attendant were associated with the presence of common
medical illnesses. However, frequency of symptoms of
nasal congestion, throat or eye irritation was associated
with years of pre-smoking ban service as a flight atten-
dant. This association was not present for post-smoking
ban years of service or total years of service, suggesting
that SHS exposure during the pre-smoking ban era may
explain the increased frequency of symptoms of nasal
congestion, throat or eye irritation.
A previous questionnaire-based study of flight atten-
dants by Ebbert et al [13] revealed high rates of COPD,
sinusitis, allergies, bronchitis, ear infections, and asthma,
but did not offer a referent comparison to the general
population. Additionally, they found that sinusitis, mid-
dle ear infections, and asthma were related to hours in a
smoky cabin. Our results further confirm their finding
that flight attendants experience higher rates of respira-
tory illnesses and experience greater upper respiratory
symptoms related to SHS exposure.
COPD has previously been associated with SHS expo-
sure in several populations [14,19,20]. Amongst never-
smoking flight attendants with occupational exposure to
SHS, pulmonary function testing has revealed evidence
of airway obstruction and impaired diffusing capacity
[14]. Similarly, our results confirm prior studies report-
ing increased rates of bronchitis related to SHS expo-
sure [21,22]. While several other investigations have
reported an association of asthma with SHS exposure

[21-23], not all have demonstrated increased rates of
asthma [24]. Our findings that flight attendants experi-
ence increased risk of COPD and chronic bronchitis are
consistent with these prior studies in populations with
SHS exposure.
In our study, we observed fewer cancers compared to
the NHANES sample, but no statistically significant dif-
ference in rates of breast cancer between the two popu-
lations. Other studies of flight attendants have yielded
conflicting results regarding rates of breast cancer. Some
demonstrate increased rates of breast cancer after peri-
ods of 15 or more years after initiation of service as a
flight attendant, despite consideration for some potential
confounders including age and reproductive status
[25,26]. However, others have found that the risk of
breast cancer amongst flight attendants is more asso-
ciated with established risk factors for breast cancer
than exposure to in flight radiation or SHS exposure
[27].
Among the most common symptoms reported by
flight attendants are those related to upper respiratory
illness, including sinusitis, ear infections, nasal conges-
tion, and throat or eye irritation [10]. We found a signif-
icant increase in frequency of nasal congestion, throat or
eye irritation symptoms associated with duration of time
as a flight attendant in the pre-smoking ban era. This
finding is consistent with previous findings of increased
risk of upper respiratory symptoms related to SHS expo-
sure in general populations [28-32] and amongst flight
attendants [13,24,33,34]. SHS is capable of inducing
changes in the nasal mucosa by inducing biofilm forma-
tion, which may alter the nasal flora and perpetuate ill-
ness [35]. However, after the airline smoking ban took
effect, a significant decrease in respirable particles and
decrease in symptoms of ocular irritation amongst flight
attendants was observed [11]. Given the consistent find-
ing that symptoms of upper respiratory illness are asso-
ciated with SHS exposure, further formal investigation is
warranted to determine the mechanisms, chronicity, and
impact of these symptoms.
Due to the nature of this questionnaire-based study,
several limitations exist. Participants were recruited via
newsletters, brochures, newspaper, and internet adver-
tisements. While respondents to these advertisements
were likely flight attendants, it is not possible to for-
mally assess who responded to the ads and participated
in the web-survey. 70% of those who visited the website
completed the survey. The results of the study may be
affected by uncontrolled selection bias of those choosing
to complete the questionnaire. Self-reporting bias may
overestimate the true prevalence of certain medical con-
ditions amongst participants. Compared to the question-
naire conducted by Ebbert et al [13], the prevalence of
disease within the FAMRI population is generally less
frequent or similar to the prevalence of disease reported
in their investigation, suggesting that bias may be
slightly less than or equivalent to previous similar stu-
dies. Other sources of bias may also be present.
Response rates were not 100% for each question, thus
ascertainment of exposures and conditions is not com-
plete. Data with regard to personal smoking history (i.e.,
age started smoking) and outside SHS exposure (e.g.,
years living with adult who smoked, years working in
occupations where others smoked) were limited. More-
over, apart from the reported years of service aboard
aircraft, the actual level of in-flight SHS exposure could
not be quantified. The lack of complete responses for
personal and SHS exposure limits the ability of this
study to find and/or control for associations between
SHS exposure and illnesses. SHS exposure determina-
tion was dependent upon responses from the question-
naire and may also be confounded by other
occupational and residential exposures. With regard to
comparison with other populations, the FAMRI popula-
tion appears generally healthier than the NHANES
population, which may be because the two populations
differ with regard to numerous employment-related and
socioeconomic factors. While we tried to account for
some of these differences by restricting the NHANES
sample to those with a high-school education or greater,
we were not able to adjust for employment status or
other variables with the currently available NHANES
2005-2006 data.
Additionally, the findings of increased rates of respira-
tory illnesses amongst flight attendants, lack of associa-
tion of most illnesses with pre-smoking ban service as a
flight attendant, and the non-significant trend towards
increased sinus problems and ear infections related to
total years of service as a flight attendant raises the pos-
sibility that some degree of upper respiratory symptoms
amongst flight attendants may not necessarily be related
to smoke exposure alone, but may relate to general
occupational exposures related to the cabin environ-
ment. The air cabin environment includes a number of
potential irritants other than tobacco smoke, including
ozone [36], cleaning agents [37], volatile by-products of
fuel and fuel combustion, pesticides, infectious agents,
and other airborne allergens [38]. Data supporting the
relationship between these agents and symptoms of
respiratory illnesses are limited [38].
Conclusions
Even though smoking has been banned from airline
flights originating in the US, the effects of SHS exposure
are still of interest to those flight attendants who with-
stood the SHS exposure and experience illness poten-
tially related to their in-flight exposure. In addition,
greater knowledge of the late effects of SHS exposure

better equips health professionals to care for these indi-
viduals. Indeed, we have demonstrated that flight atten-
dants experience increased rates of many respiratory
illnesses compared to the general population, and some
of the increased frequency of symptoms is related to
SHS exposure. While flight attendants are no longer
subject to in-flight SHS exposure, SHS exposure con-
tinues to affect individuals in other occupations and
remains an area for research and advocacy.
