seeking for mental health problems in Europe:
a cross-sectional population-based study

Abstract
Background: Little is known about differences in professional care seeking based on marital status. The few
existing studies show more professional care seeking among the divorced or separated compared to the married
or cohabiting. The aim of this study is to determine whether, in a sample of the European general population, the
divorced or separated seek more professional mental health care than the married or cohabiting, regardless of self-
reported mental health problems. Furthermore, we examine whether two country-level features­the supply of
mental health professionals and the country-level divorce rates­contribute to marital status differences in
professional care-seeking behavior.
Methods: We use data from the Eurobarometer 248 on mental well-being that was collected via telephone
interviews. The unweighted sample includes 27,146 respondents (11,728 men and 15,418 women). Poisson
hierarchical regression models were estimated to examine whether the divorced or separated have higher
professional health care use for emotional or psychological problems, after controlling for mental and somatic
health, sociodemographic characteristics, support from family and friends, and degree of urbanization. We also
considered country-level divorce rates and indicators of the supply of mental health professionals, and applied
design and population weights.
Results: We find that professional care seeking is strongly need based. Moreover, the divorced or separated
consult health professionals for mental health problems more often than people who are married or who cohabit
do. In addition, we find that the gap between the divorced or separated and the married or cohabiting is highest
in countries with low divorce rates.
Conclusions: The higher rates of professional care seeking for mental health problems among the divorced or
separated only partially correlates with their more severe mental health problems. In countries where marital
dissolution is more common, the marital status gap in professional care seeking is narrower, partially because
professional care seeking is more common among the married or cohabiting.
Background
The increase in the divorce rate has received a great deal
of scientific attention. Most research has focused on the
consequences of divorce or separation for ex-partners and
their children. The health consequences of divorce are
also well documented, showing the detrimental effects of
divorce on both somatic [1-5] and mental health [2,6-9],
with the divorced or separated experiencing higher levels
of depression, stress, and fear, as well as lower levels of
self-esteem [10-20]. However, little is known about how
these adverse mental health consequences translate into
the use of health care services. A few existing studies have
indicated that mental health care use and health care use
in general is higher among the divorced or separated than
among the married or cohabiting, regardless of mental
health status [21-24]. Compared to the married or coha-
biting, the divorced or separated visit professional health
care providers like general practitioners [21], specialists
[21], and psychiatrists [22] more often, and are also hospi-
talized more often [21,25]. Single mothers seem to suffer

the most; they have more health problems and turn to
professional mental health services more frequently
[26-29]. Moreover, Dutch research has indicated that the
divorced or separated not only have higher rates of mental
health care use, they also have higher rates of unmet need.
This means that they are more often in a situation in
which they have mental health care needs but do not
receive sufficient care [30]. On the other hand, for a sub-
group of single mothers, a Canadian study found that the
higher use of professionals for mental health reasons
reflected their higher rates of psychopathology [29].
Apart from Bijl and Ravelli's study [30], the aforemen-
tioned studies were not based on a representative sample
of the general population, did not adjust for important
intermediary variables or confounders like socioeconomic
status and the availability of informal support [25], or did
not include data on anyone other than women [25].
Furthermore, existing studies have focused only on a
single country­the United States of America [22], the
Netherlands [30], Canada [29,31], or the United Kingdom
[25]. Moreover, only two studies [25,30] have focused on
care seeking for mental health problems. In this study,
we examine whether there are differences between
the divorced and the married in professional care seeking
due to mental health problems, using a representative
sample of the population of 29 European countries. Based
on Andersen's Behavioral Model [32], we are able to iden-
tify some social structural determinants that explain these
individual differences in mental health care consumption
at both the individual and the country level. Andersen's
Behavioral Model asserts that the consumption of medical
care depends on the presence of predisposing characteris-
tics, enabling resources, and need factors.
Predisposing characteristics are those features that are
present before the development of a mental health pro-
blem. We consider household composition, education,
work status, age, and gender to be relevant predisposing
features.
The predisposing characteristic that is our main inter-
est is household composition­more specifically, marital
status. A few studies that exist show that different family
compositions are associated with different amounts of
health care use [25,33] and demonstrate that there is a
higher mental health care consumption among the
divorced or separated than the married or cohabiting
[21-23,34]. Another relevant aspect of household com-
position is the presence of children. Because divorced
parents are forced to maintain contact with each other,
the presence of children in the household may have an
impact on their mental health. In addition, having sole
custody of children often involves parenting strain and
financial costs, making it more difficult to find a job,
make new friends, or find a new partner [35-37], all of
which act as important buffers against mental health
problems (e.g., [2]). On the other hand, children may
add a sense of meaning to parents' lives, and older chil-
dren in particular may be an important source of practi-
cal and social support for their parents [38,39].
Educational level also affects the amount of mental
health care consumption sought. Even after controlling
for mental health status, the lower educated are less
inclined to turn to professional mental health care ser-
vices [24]. Previous research has indicated that divorce
is more common among the highly educated [40], which
may explain the higher mental health care use among
the divorced. Recently, however, some authors [41,42]
have argued that in countries where the cost of divorce
has decreased, the lower educated are more at risk of
divorce, undermining that explanation.
Work status also correlates with the use of mental
health care: compared to working people, people outside
of the labor market, like the unemployed, the retired,
and housewives and househusbands, are found to be
less inclined to seek professional care because of mental
health problems [24,43], even after mental health status
is controlled for. Consequently, since divorced people
have an increased risk of being laid off [44,45], we could
expect them to seek professional mental health care less
often.
With regard to age, the risk of illness increases with
age and, consequently, health care consumption expands
[43,46].
Research has also shown that women have higher
health care utilization rates than men [24,46,47]. Some
research indicates that this is largely explained by the
existence of gender differences in mental health regard-
less of marital status [46]. Some researchers assert that
being divorced or separated has a more severe impact
on the mental health of women than of men [12,48],
which may explain higher mental health care consump-
tion by divorced women. Others explain these gender
differences in service use by pointing out that women
are generally found to be more inclined to seek profes-
sional help, even after their actual need is controlled for
[49]. According to these researchers, the impact of mari-
tal status on mental health care consumption might
therefore differ by gender, with women having a higher
mental health care use rate than men.
Enabling resources are the means and knowledge
needed to acquire care. To receive care, one has to pos-
sess both financial means and the knowledge of where
to go to seek help. In Europe, the wealthy are more
likely to seek out specialist care, while access to primary
care seems to be pro-poor or equal for all income
groups, even after controlling for need [50,51]. In addi-
tion, social support from relatives and friends can be
considered an enabling resource. On the one hand,
social support can encourage health care use, as social

networks may help with the recognition of the develop-
ment of health problems and may stimulate a person to
seek professional care [32,52-54]. On the other hand,
social support may also impede health care consump-
tion. Individuals experiencing problems usually turn to
their immediate environment for help before contacting
formal care services. However, as individuals with low
levels of social support cannot rely on the help of their
acquaintances, asking for professional care can be a way
to compensate for a lack of social support [32,55]. Com-
pared to the married and cohabiting, the divorced have
smaller social networks and less social support available
to them [56]. In addition to the loss of their former
partner, they also lose half of their relatives and, often,
some shared friends [38]. We therefore expect the
divorced to have higher mental health care use due to
less available social support.
Need factors include health status and the perceived
need for help [21,32]. On average, the divorced, com-
pared to the married, have worse somatic [2,4,5,21] and
mental health statuses. They experience higher levels of
distress, depression, and anxiety [2,6,7], and have to deal
with certain somatic problems more frequently [2],
often putting an extra burden on their mental health.
The differences in mental and physical health can be
largely­but not completely­explained by a socioeco-
nomic situation that is worse and by a lack of social
support [2,3,57]. Other explanations are health selection
effects­healthier individuals are less likely to divorce
[2,4,58], the damaging effects of the stigmatization of
divorce, and the occurrence of negative life events as a
consequence of divorce, for example, having to move
[2]. Thus, the higher health care consumption of the
divorced may be in large part a consequence of worse
physical and/or mental health. However, even after con-
trolling for these need factors, previous research indi-
cates that the mental health care consumption rate of
the divorced seems to remain higher than that of the
married [21,25]. Moreover, persons without a partner
express higher unmet care needs than those living with
a partner [30].
To control for between-country differences in the
distribution of our key variables­marital status and
professional care consumption­we consider two country-
level indicators, the country-level divorce rates and the
supply of professional care.
We expect to see differences between countries in the
use of mental health services on the basis of marital sta-
tus, because norms and values about family and divorce
as well as social policies about marital dissolution and
sole parenthood vary between countries [59]. At present,
there is insufficient research on the link between the
divorce rate and marital status differences as they relate
to mental health service use. However, we see two
possible ways in which the divorce rate might interact
with the relation between marital status and mental
health services use. First, we expect to find that higher
divorce rates go hand in hand with an enhanced profes-
sional service use by the divorced. Although more subtle
forms of stigmatization are still possible [60], one can
expect divorce to be less stigmatized in countries where
the divorce rate is higher [61], making it easier for the
divorced to seek help [62]. Second, there are indications
that the use of professional care among the divorced
could actually be lower in countries with a high divorce
rate. On the basis of social comparison theory [62] and
of research on divorce and stigma [60], we can assume
that people in high-divorce countries will no longer
view marital dissolution as different or problematic
[7,63-65], resulting in a relative decline in professional
care seeking among the divorced. Of course, it is also
possible that the divorce rate has no effect on profes-
sional care consumption beyond the compositional
effects that result from the marital status composition of
the population.
The availability of mental health services may also
influence utilization [66]. We expect that the use of pro-
fessional mental health care will be greater in countries
where help is available and accessible. According to
Wang et al. [67], unmet need is worse in low- and mid-
dle-income countries, and the treatment gap may there-
fore be attributable to the reduced amount these nations
have to spend on mental health care from health bud-
gets that are already overburdened [66]. Consequently,
we can expect cross-national variation in the availability
of mental health services to influence utilization, even
among middle- and high-income European countries.
Hence, the availability of general or more specialized
professionals is a supply-side factor that should not be
ignored [68] and that could be incorporated into Ander-
sen's model as an important enabling factor at the
supra-individual level. Country-level indicators are
unable to accommodate important within-country
differences in the availability of mental health services.
In order to consider these within-country differences,
we also include the degree of urbanization in the area of
residence as a rough indicator of the availability of more
specialized mental health professionals [68]. Differences
between rural and urban areas may also signal differ-
ences in stigma beliefs. For instance, as Hoyt and collea-
gues [50] have shown, in the rural areas of the United
States a reluctance to seek professional help is closely
linked to stigmatizing beliefs about mental health care.
In sum, we will first examine whether a difference
exists between the married or cohabiting and the
divorced or separated in their use of professional health
care for emotional or psychological problems. Second,
we will try to uncover some predisposing, enabling, and

need factors that explain this possible difference in
amount of use. Finally, we intend to examine between-
country variation by introducing country characteris-
tics­divorce rate and the supply of services­into the
analysis.
Method
Sample
We derived data from multistage national probability
samples of the general population of 29 European coun-
tries collected during the Eurobarometer 248 survey
between December 2005 and January 2006. The sam-
pling design in all participating countries was based on
a random selection of sampling areas stratified by urba-
nization (the distribution of metropolitan, urban, and
rural areas). A cluster of addresses were selected from
these sampled areas. In each household at a sampled
address, a respondent was selected using a random
selection procedure [69]. Telephone interviews were
conducted with European Union citizens residing in the
25 member countries, with the citizens of the two then-
acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, and with the
two candidate countries Croatia and Turkey including
the citizens of the Turkish Cypriot Community. In our
analyses, we merged the data from East and West Ger-
many, from Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom,
and from the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish
Cypriot Community. For the present analysis, we limited
the sample to respondents aged 21 and older; respon-
dents from all marital status categories were included.
We applied population weights so that each country was
represented in proportion to its population size, and we
considered country-specific design weights to correct for
differences within national populations in gender, age,
region, and size of locality.
The resulting samples are representative of the popu-
lation of citizens in the included countries aged 21 and
over. In total, 27,146 respondents were included (11,728
men and 15,418 women). Table 1 presents descriptive
statistics of the weighted sample.
Variables
Professional care use
The dependent variable professional care use was mea-
sured by the total number of different health profes-
sionals­general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist,
psychoanalyst, nurse, social worker, or psychotherapist
(not mentioned previously)­that respondents had con-
tacted for an emotional or psychological health problem
during the last 12 months. The total number of these
events followed a Poisson distribution. Most people
(85.9%) had not contacted a health professional because
of emotional or psychological problems during the past
12 months.
Health status
We included both physical and mental health status in
the analysis. Physical health was measured by compiling
the answers to the question "During the past 4 weeks
how much of the time have you had any of the follow-
ing problems with your work or other regular activities
as a result of your physical health?" Respondents could
address the two items­"you have accomplished less than
you would like" and "you have accomplished your usual
activities less carefully"­using responses ranging from
all the time through never. A higher score indicates bet-
ter physical health. Our physical health indicator con-
sists of the mean score of these two items. Scores
on both items correlate very strongly with Pearson's
r = 0.85 (p < 0.001). The bivariate correlation exceeds
0.76 in all participating countries except Denmark,

where a correlation coefficient of 0.66 still points to a
strong association between both items. Mental health
was based on the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey
[70], which includes both a mental health (5 items, the
MHI-5) and an energy/vitality (4 items, the EVI scale)
dimension. The scale used here consists of the mean of
all nine item scores, and gives an indication of how the
respondents have felt and how things went during the
last 4 weeks, with a higher score indicating a better
mental health status. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.89
demonstrates its reliability; Cronbach's alpha exceeds
0.84 in all participating countries.
Information on physical health was lacking for 184
respondents (0.7% of the sample); while 108 respondents
(0.4% of the sample) failed to provide answers to at least
six items of the mental health dimension. Full informa-
tion on these two health status measures was available
for 99.3% and 97.3%, respectively, of the sample. For
both health status indicators, the overall item mean
scores replaced missing values.
Predisposing characteristics
Marital status is the main independent variable in this
study. In Table 1, we compared respondents who are
divorced or separated (11.8%), single (10.4%), or
widowed (12.2%), as well as a generic category of uni-
dentified others (0.9%) to those who are married or who
cohabit (64.6%). The category of unidentified others
contains respondents who spontaneously classified
themselves in this rest category. It is important to note
that we measured the current marital status: respon-
dents who were divorced or separated but were living
together with a new partner were categorized as married
or cohabiting.
The number of children (up to 15 years old), and the
number of adult household members (15+) in addition
to the spouse/partner were added. The reference group
was a household that had no other members besides the
spouse/partner. The data did not allow us to distinguish
between children aged 16 and over and others of com-
parable age living in the household.
The number of years of education the respondents
had completed was subdivided into the following cate-
gories (see Table 1): 20 years or more (25.5%), 16
through 19 years (42.6%), and less than 16 years
(25.4%). Those who had studied 20 years or more were
set as the reference category. Separate categories were
added for those still studying (3.2%) and those whose
educational level is unknown (3.3%).
Work status was measured on the basis of social class
and employment status, using eight categories (see
Table 1): managers/professionals (10.2%), white-collar
workers (10.7%), the self-employed (7.9%), manual work-
ers (20.8%), the unemployed (6.1%), the retired (30.0%),
students (3.2%), and housewives and househusbands
(11.1%). Manual workers were set as the reference
category.
Age was measured in years and had a mean of 49.6 years
with a standard deviation of 17.1 years (see Table 1).
Enabling resources
Our measure of social support was based on the ques-
tion "Who would you contact for first health support?"
Multiple answers were possible. Two dichotomous indi-
cators were constructed (see Table 1) indicating respon-
dents who mentioned they would seek support from
their family (49.8%), and, in a separate variable, from
their friends (20.1%).
The measure of the degree of urbanization of the
place of residence was based on the question "Would
you say you live in a rural area or village, a small- or
middle-sized town, or a large town?" People living in a
rural area or a village were set as the reference category.
Country-level characteristics
Using information provided by Eurostat [71], we deter-
mined country-level divorce rates for 2005. Like other
research, the current study used area provider density
scores to measure supply-side effects [72,73].
We constructed an overall indicator of the supply of
professional care by totaling the number of general
practitioners per 100,000 inhabitants, the number of
psychiatrists and psychologists per 100,000 inhabitants,
and the number of psychiatric nurses or social workers
in mental health settings per 100,000 inhabitants [74].
Analysis
Hierarchical linear models were estimated using HLM
version 6.0 [75]. We based our outcome variable on the
number of occurrences of a relatively rare event, namely,
consulting a health professional. Therefore, due to the
nature of the dependent variable, Poisson regression
analyses were appropriate [75]. We added an estimate of
overdispersion, s2, to the equations to adjust for the
dependence of the variance on the mean of the outcome
indicator [76]. The intra-class correlation is 0.064
(=0.096/[0.096 + 1.41]), therefore 6.4% of the total var-
iance in the outcome is between-countries variance
(Chi2 [df = 28] = 309.2, p < 0.001; no Table).
All variables were grand mean centered. As mentioned
above, both population and design weights were applied.
First, a baseline model was estimated, showing the
results of marital status and gender as well as the inter-
action effect with gender and being divorced or sepa-
rated (Model 1). We added random slope estimates to
account for between-country variation in the effects of
divorce on the outcome variable professional mental
health care for both women and men.
After need factors (Model 2), predisposing characteris-
tics and enabling resources (Model 3) were introduced.
In the final model (Model 4), country characteristics

and the various cross-level interactions between divorce
rate and the different marital status categories were
added. Also, all cross-level interactions between our
supply of professional care indicator and the different
marital status categories were added in addition to the
random slope estimates of all marital status categories.
Estimations of this more elaborate model show signifi-
cant between-country variations between all marital sta-
tus categories and professional care use, but show no
significant cross-level interaction effects with the supply
of professional care. Therefore, a final, more parsimo-
nious, model is estimated (Model 5) after elimination of
the latter cross-level interaction effects.
The country-level descriptive statistics are shown in
Table 2. Information on the supply of psychiatric nurses
or social workers in mental health settings was lacking
in two countries, Belgium and Croatia. Therefore, the
country-level supply of professional care indicator for
these countries was constructed after substituting overall
mean scores for missing values. We controlled for the
possible effects of this missing values substitution by
adding a dichotomous indicator that identifies both
countries with partially missing information on the sup-
ply of professionals. The results of this analysis were
very close to the results reported in Tables 3 and 4:
All coefficients showed similar levels of significance and
the aforementioned indicator of missing value substitu-
tion exerted no significant effect (g = 0.054, SE = 0.263,
p = 0.838).
Because of the large sample size, we set the minimum
level of significance at p < 0.001 for the individual-level
effects, and at p < 0.05 for the country-level and the
cross-level effects.
Results
The estimation of the baseline model shows that, com-
pared to the married or cohabiting, the divorced or sepa-
rated (Table 3, Model 1: B = 0.59, SE = 0.114, p < 0.001;
event rate = 1.80 [95% CI 1.42, 2.27]) and the widowed
(Table 3, Model 1: B = 0.456, SE = 0.066, p < 0.001; event
rate = 1.58 [95% CI 1.39, 1.80]) visit professional health
care providers more often when facing emotional or psy-
chological health. Furthermore, women consult more
health care professionals than men do (Table 3, Model 1:
B = 0.303, SE = 0.055, p < 0.001; event rate = 1.35
[95% CI 1.21, 1.51]). Despite these significant effects, no
overall divorce*gender interaction effect was found con-
cerning the use of mental health care (Table 3, Model 1:
Bgender*divorced
= -0.039, SE = 0.126, p = 0.756). Significant
random slope coefficients are present for all core vari-
ables (Table 3, Model 1: divorce
= 0.21, p < .001,
SD = 0.46; gender
= 0.05, p < .01, SD = 0.22; divorce*gender
=
0.25, p < .01, SD = 0.50), showing significant between-
countries variation in the aforementioned findings: In some
countries the aforementioned findings do not hold, while
in other countries they are more pronounced. For instance,
our baseline model estimates that in approximately 20 coun-
tries the effect of divorce or separation on professional care
use falls within a range of 1.05 > Bdivorce
> 0.13.
After including both somatic and mental health status
(Table 3: Model 2), some of the aforementioned marital
status and gender differences in professional care use
are found to be attenuated. Gender differences in pro-
fessional care seeking seem to be largely need based
(B = 0.108, SE = 0.053, p = n.s.). The more frequent
professional care consumption of the widowed
also coincides with their self-reported health status
(B = -0.093, SE = 0.065, p = n.s.). In contrast, the pro-
fessional care seeking of the divorced or separated is
only partially accounted for by their somatic and mental
health status (B = 0.366, SE = 0.092, p < 0.001).
These findings remain consistent after introducing the
predisposing factors (sociodemographic controls) and
enabling resources (the availability of support from
friends and family) into the model (Table 3: Model 3).

(B = 0.165, SE = 0.093, p < 0.05) and the retired
(B = 0.246, SE = 0.082, p < 0.01) seek professional sup-
port for mental health problems more often. Younger
adults also rely on professionals more often (B = -0.005,

the strength of the random coefficients.
Finally, in Model 4 we added the two country-level
indicators and the accompanying cross-level interaction
effects with divorce and the other marital status cate-
gories (see Table 3 and 4). The country-level supply of
health professionals does not exert any substantial effect
on the use of professional care. In contrast, differences
in professional care use between the divorced or sepa-
rated and the married or cohabiting depend heavily on
the country-level divorce rates: In countries with high
rates of marital dissolution, the marital status differences
largely disappear (Bdivorce

cohabiting and the divorced or separated at 0.11 and
0.23, respectively, in countries with low overall divorce
rates (mean minus 2 std. dev.), at 0.13 and 0.19, respec-
tively, in countries with mean overall divorce rates, and
at 0.16 and 0.16, respectively, in countries with high
overall divorce rates (mean plus 2 std. dev.). These esti-
mated scores make it clear that in countries with a high
divorce rate the marital status gap in professional care
use is smaller because of not only lower care use among
the divorced or separated, but also because of higher
care use among the currently married and cohabiting.
Discussion
Using data from the Eurobarometer 248, we estimated
marital status differences in professional care use for
mental health problems in a sample of 27,146 inhabi-
tants of 29 European countries, 21 years and older. We
found that the divorced or separated, compared to the
married or cohabiting, seek professional support more
often irrespective of mental and physical health status,
and irrespective of social background (education, work
status) or of available informal support. Moreover, these
marital status differences vary from country to country.
We found large differences in countries with low overall
divorce rates, irrespective of the availability of health
professionals. In countries with higher divorce rates, the
marital status gap largely disappears not only because
professional care seeking among the divorced is lower,
but also because the married or cohabiting seek profes-
sional support more frequently. Before interpreting our
results, some limitations should be considered.
First, financial means are an important enabling
resource in regard to professional care [32]. Overall,
low-income groups were found to use fewer mental
health services, after controlling for mental health status
[19,49,59], although important differences appear when
comparing general and specialized professional support.
In the present study, we were unable to consider income
differences due to the limitations of the dataset used.
This meant that an important aspect of the explanation
for higher mental health care use for the divorced or
separated was missing, given that the divorced or sepa-
rated­especially single parents­experience a more strin-
gent financial situation [60-62]. Nevertheless, the
indicators of education and work status may at least
partially replace these income effects. Moreover, because
we expect mental health professional care seeking to be
less among low-income groups, the inability to consider

the financial situation statistically could actually lead to
an underestimation of the marital status differences in
professional care seeking.
Second, our dependent variable reflected both general
and specialized professional care use for emotional or
psychological health problems. By using such a broad
indicator, we were not able to explore marital status dif-
ferences in general vis--vis specialized professional
care. The low prevalence of specialized professional care
use in most marital status categories in the present sam-
ple indicates that in future research, larger samples are
needed to differentiate between categories of profes-
sional care and to explore their interrelatedness.
Third, we had only a very rough indicator of social
support at our disposal. Respondents were simply asked
whether they could turn to friends and to family for
first health support. However, social support is impor-
tant to divorced or separated people for coping with
their emotional and psychological problems, even prior
to an escalation of those problems.
Fourth, we faced some limitations concerning time.
This analysis is based on cross-sectional data, which
may hinder a causal interpretation of the results. This is
problematic when considering the association between
(mental) health status and professional care-seeking
behavior. Physical and mental health status was mea-
sured at the time of the interview, while the use of men-
tal health care in the 12 months preceding the interview
was measured retrospectively. Nevertheless, the former
measurement is considered a predictor of the latter.
Longitudinal data might help circumvent this problem,
but cross-national longitudinal datasets containing infor-
mation on marital status, mental health status, and men-
tal health professional care seeking are currently
nonexistent. In addition, we cannot rule out that possi-
ble selection effects may account for the association
between marital status and professional care seeking, as
previous research has indicated that at least a part of
the relation between divorce and mental health is due to
selection effects [9,14,77,78]. However, as our results on
professional care use for mental health problems are in
line with the only longitudinal study, to our knowledge,
on this topic [9], we believe that a substantial part of
the differences in mental health care use is a conse-
quence of the divorce or separation. In addition, because
our study measured professional care use during the
12 months preceding the interview, while the health sta-
tus indicators referred to only the last 4 weeks, the pre-
sent results potentially underestimate the importance of
the latter. It is unlikely, however, that the lack of com-
parable time frames explains the marital status differ-
ences in professional care seeking. For instance, the
present indicator of mental and somatic health status is
able to statistically explain the professional care use
among the widowed; therefore we could expect it to be
a suitable need indicator for the divorced as well.
Finally, due to data limitations we could only consider
current marital status. This prevents us from distin-
guishing between past and current marital status. As a
result, we are unable to separate, for instance, married
persons from married persons who were previously
divorced.
Despite these limitations, our results offer at least
three important insights. First, in accordance with pre-
vious research [9,10,15,21], we found that the divorced
or separated, compared to the married or cohabiting, do
have a higher mental health care use, and that differ-
ences between the two groups can be only partly
explained by differences in physical and mental health.
Our findings are based on a representative sample of
the population of 29 European countries. They confirm
that the more frequent professional care use among the
divorced or separated is present in most of the partici-
pating countries, albeit to varying degrees. Mental health
status has a strong impact on mental health care use
and explains professional care seeking among the
widowed, and, to a substantial degree, among women.
The finding that need factors can explain health service
use among the widowed but not among the divorced
corroborates previous research by Prigerson et al. [9].
These differential effects confirm that a substantial part
of the mental health care use for emotional or psycholo-
gical problems among the divorced or separated relates
to factors­what Andersen calls "need factors"­other
than somatic and mental health status. However,
our predisposing characteristics and enabling resources,
like social conditions related to level of education, work
status, age, and the perceived availability of support
from friends and family, cannot account for this marital
status effect either. Consequently, the finding that the
divorced or separated use mental health services more
often than the married or cohabiting may indicate the
power of relationship loss, bereavement, strife, or social
impairment as motivators for seeking treatment (see
also [21,22]).
Additionally, we found that cross-national differences
in the association between marital dissolution and pro-
fessional care use are considerable and are linked to the
average divorce rate in the participating countries. The
higher the divorce rate, the smaller the gap in profes-
sional care use between the divorced or separated and
the married or cohabiting. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this study is the first to document this cross-level
interaction effect. Even more fascinating is the finding
that the diminished marital status gap in countries with
high average divorce rates results from both an
increased professional care use for emotional or psycho-
logical problems among married or unmarried couples

and a decrease in this help-seeking behavior among the
divorced. Gelissen [63] found that the degree of toler-
ance towards divorce correlates with the national rate of
divorce. Therefore, the normalization of divorce [64]
may account for less professional care seeking after mar-
ital dissolution in countries with high divorce rates. In
these countries, divorce is probably less stigmatizing, or
is seen as less intrinsically problematic, leading to a net
decline in professional care seeking. A post hoc inter-
pretation of the increase in professional care seeking
among the married or cohabiting may be that in coun-
tries with high divorce rates changes in the meaning of
marriage and divorce [63,65-67] may lead both to a
higher propensity among couples to proactively contact
professional care providers for marriage and relationship
counseling and to less reliance on professional support
in the aftermath of a marriage breakup. In societies with
high divorce rates, a divorce culture gives way to a ther-
apeutic culture [67] in which the married also rely on
mental health professionals for counseling more fre-
quently. It is, in part, because of these opposing effects
of the national divorce rates on the professional care
seeking of the divorced or separated versus the married
or cohabiting that we do not find overall effects of the
national rates of divorce on the mental health profes-
sional support-seeking rate. Because our analyses
are based on a comparison of current marital status
categories, we cannot determine whether this finding
results from the impact of remarriage after divorce. It is
still possible that the increase of professional care seek-
ing among the married in countries with high divorce
rates is confined to those who remarried after divorce.
Analyses of cross-national datasets containing detailed
information about marital status transitions are needed
to solve this problem.
Finally, gender and work status prove to be important
determinants for mental health care use, while age and
education do not seem to matter. In line with earlier
studies, we found that women use more mental health
care than men do. In line with the findings of Koop-
mans and Lamers [26], although contrary to other
research [68], we also found that in most countries this
higher mental health care use among women can be
completely attributed to self-reported poor mental and
physical health. Our hypothesis that the gap in mental
health care use between the divorced and married
would be greater for women than for men could not
be confirmed. Nevertheless, a significant amount of
between-country variation in the gendered effect of mar-
ital status on professional care seeking was present, sug-
gesting that in some countries divorce leads to increased
professional care seeking among women, while in other
countries a reversed gender difference can be observed.
We did not find any effects from education, presence of
children in the household, or social support. These
results contrast with what we might expect to find
[4,19,20,23,26,69]. When considering the lack of an
effect for the presence of children, however, it is possi-
ble that two opposite forces are at work: A negative
"burden" effect of the presence of children in the house-
hold [21,22] may be neutralized by a more positive
effect that comes from the support children may give to
their parents [16-18]. Not having custody of one's chil-
dren can be a significant stress factor as well and thus a
reason to seek professional care. This is especially rele-
vant for divorced fathers, who often experience signifi-
cantly decreased contact with their children. Within the
divorced group, more detailed analyses are needed to
refine these diverging effects. Social support, measured
as first health support, does not have a strong influence
on the consumption of different health care providers.
We find a significant but less substantial effect of the
availability of friends as first health supporters, suggest-
ing that the availability of support from laypersons actu-
ally enhances professional care consumption. Friends
help a person gain insight into personal and emotional
problems and stimulate a person to seek professional
care [30,33].
Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first compre-
hensive study of a large European sample that focuses
on the differences in mental health service use between
the divorced or separated and the married or cohabiting
and that considers both individual and country charac-
teristics. The present study has shown that the higher
health care use for emotional or psychological problems
by the divorced and separated is only partly explained
by worse mental and physical health. In addition, our
research clearly shows that it is important to consider
differences at the country level when studying marital
status differences in professional care use: In countries
with a high national divorce rate, the gap between the
married or cohabiting and the divorced or separated
regarding use of professional mental health care
diminishes dramatically. Married and unmarried couples
are more frequent user of mental health professional
support, while the consumption of professional care
among the divorced or separated is lower than in coun-
tries where divorce occurs less frequently.
In sum, we have reason to assume that in countries
with high divorce rates, those seeking professional sup-
port for mental health problems are more proactive,
while in countries where divorce is less common, the
divorced seek professional support to cope with the det-
rimental consequences of marital dissolution.
