OBJECTIVE -- Although glycemic levels are known to rise with normal aging, the nondia-
betic A1C range is not age specific. We examined whether A1C was associated with age in
nondiabetic subjects and in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) in two population-
based cohorts.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We performed cross-sectional analyses of
A1C across age categories in 2,473 nondiabetic participants of the Framingham Offspring Study
(FOS) and in 3,270 nondiabetic participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 2001­2004. In FOS, we examined A1C by age in a subset with NGT, i.e.,
after excluding those with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance
(IGT). Multivariate analyses were performed, adjusting for sex, BMI, fasting glucose, and 2-h
postload glucose values.
RESULTS -- In the FOS and NHANES cohorts, A1C levels were positively associated with age
in nondiabetic subjects. Linear regression revealed 0.014- and 0.010-unit increases in A1C per
year in the nondiabetic FOS and NHANES populations, respectively. The 97.5th percentiles for
A1C were 6.0% and 5.6% for nondiabetic individuals aged 40 years in FOS and NHANES,
respectively, compared with 6.6% and 6.2% for individuals aged 70 years (Ptrend
 0.001).
The association of A1C with age was similar when restricted to the subset of FOS subjects with
NGT and after adjustments for sex, BMI, fasting glucose, and 2-h postload glucose values.
CONCLUSIONS -- A1C levels are positively associated with age in nondiabetic populations
even after exclusion of subjects with IFG and/or IGT. Further studies are needed to determine
whether age-specific diagnostic and treatment criteria would be appropriate.
Diabetes Care 31:1991­1996, 2008
Glycemia is recognized to change
with age. The prevalence of diabe-
tes and impaired glucose homeosta-
sis (impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and
impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) is in-
creased among older individuals (1). Given
the large size of the elderly type 2 diabetic
population (approximately 15.3% diag-
nosed and 6.9% undiagnosed) (2), it is im-
portant to consider the effects of aging on
glycemic measures, particularly as targets
are set for diabetes management.
A1C levels are used globally as an in-
dex of average glycemia over the preced-
ing 8­12 weeks (3), as a marker for risk of
development of diabetes complications,
and to guide therapy (4). Some reports
have demonstrated an association of A1C
with age (5­13), whereas others have not
(14­17). Higher A1C levels with ad-
vanced age may be a function of a higher
prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in
older individuals. The nondiabetic range
for A1C, used worldwide and for all age-
groups, was established by the Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)
20 years ago (18). A group of 124 non-
diabetic healthy volunteers aged 13­39
years was drawn from local DCCT clinics
to generate the A1C distribution. The vol-
unteers did not have an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) to exclude undiag-
nosed diabetes and were not representa-
tive of individuals aged 40 years.
Current A1C targets for diabetes
treatment set by the American Diabetes
Association (A1C 7%) (19) or the
American College of Endocrinology (A1C
6.5%) (20) are not age specific. The
central role played by A1C in the manage-
ment of diabetes (4) and possibly in its
diagnosis (21) raises the question of
whether there are age-related differences
in A1C. If so, current A1C targets may be
too stringent for older type 2 diabetic pa-
tients, who have an increased risk of hy-
poglycemia and medication side effects
(22,23).
Our aim was to examine the relation-
ship between A1C and age using current
diagnosis criteria for diabetes in nondia-
betic subjects and in subjects with no ab-
normality in glucose homeostasis using
two large, diverse population-based co-
horts, the community-based Framing-
ham Offspring Study (FOS) and the
nationally representative National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2001­2004 population. In
subsidiary analyses, we assessed this rela-
tionship in FOS subjects with normal glu-
cose tolerance (NGT), after exclusion of

those with IFG and/or IGT determined by
an OGTT. Finally, in a subset of FOS par-
ticipants with longitudinal A1C data, we
determined the annual rate of change in
A1C as an alternate approach to test the
hypothesis that A1C increases with age.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The FOS, a communi-
ty-based population study in Framing-
ham, Massachusetts, was described
previously (24). This predominantly
white population has been studied every
4­8 years since 1971: interim histories
are obtained, and clinical examinations
are performed.
NHANES is a national population-
based study based on household sam-
pling with oversampling for minority
groups. NHANES 2001­2004 data were
used for this analysis. Detailed descrip-
tions of the sample design, interviewing
procedures, and physical examinations
have been published (25,26).
We performed a cross-sectional anal-
ysis of 2,473 nondiabetic FOS partici-
pants (aged 25 years) who attended
their fifth examination between January
1991 and September 1995, during which
fasting glucose and A1C were measured
and a 75-g OGTT was performed. FOS
subjects with diabetes, determined on the
basis of previous treatment with antidia-
betic medications or fasting plasma glu-
cose (FPG) 126 mg/dl, were excluded.
The nondiabetic cohort was classified as
having IFG if FPG was between 100 and
125 mg/dl and IGT if 2-h postload glu-
cose was 140­199 mg/dl (19). Partici-
pants with NGT had FPG 100 mg/dl
and 2-h postload glucose 140 mg/dl.
Fifty-nine subjects who had missing 2-h
postload blood glucose measurements
were excluded from the NGT analyses.
Of the 2001­2004 NHANES sample,
we limited our eligible study population
to the 3,272 individuals aged 25 years
who did not have diagnosed diabetes and
had an FPG 126 mg/dl (OGTT was not
performed). Two individuals were not in-
cluded because they did not have an A1C
test available. Diagnosed diabetes was de-
fined as a self-reported history of diabetes.
American Diabetes Association diagnostic
criteria were used to categorize individu-
als with previously undiagnosed diabetes
(FPG 126 mg/dl) (19).
Laboratory measurements
A1C was measured in FOS and NHANES
study subjects using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays
standardized to DCCT values by the Na-
tional Glycohemoglobin Standardization
Program (27). The A1C assays used in
both studies have inter- and intra-assay
coefficients of variation (CVs) 3%. As-
say drift in the HPLC method used in FOS
is prevented by the use of long-term
stored reference samples. In NHANES,
the boronate affinity HPLC method was
used.
Plasma glucose levels were measured
with a hexokinase reagent kit (A-gent glu-
cose test, Abbott Laboratories, South Pas-
adena, CA) in FOS and with a hexokinase
assay in NHANES (COBAS MIRA Chem-
istry System; Roche Diagnostic Systems,
Montclair, NJ). The intra-assay CV was
3% for both assays.
Statistical analysis
Framingham offspring study. We cat-
egorized age into groups of 5 years (i.e.,
40, 40­44, 45­49, 50­54, 55­59,
60­64, 65­69, and 70 years) with the
age-groups collapsed for adequate sample
size in the youngest and oldest bins. A1C
levels were analyzed by age and by sex.
Differences in mean A1C by age-group
were examined by ANOVA. Tests for
trend were performed using linear regres-
sion analysis. Secondary analyses consid-
ered sex-specific age-A1C associations.
The sex-by-age interaction on A1C levels
was tested with a first-order multiplica-
tive interaction term. The effect of fasting
and 2-h postload glucose values on the
association of A1C and age was also ex-
amined. The 97.5th percentile of A1C was
measured in the FOS nondiabetic sample
to estimate the upper limit of A1C by age-
group. A subset of FOS subjects with no
evidence of IGT and IFG was analyzed to
examine whether the increase in A1C
with age was still evident. The effect of
increasing age on A1C was examined in
1,704 nondiabetic FOS participants who
had A1C measured at examinations 5 and
7 (1998­2001) to determine whether the
A1C differences by age observed in the
cross-sectional analysis corresponded to
changes observed longitudinally. Change
in weight between examinations 5 and 7
was included as a potential confounder in
multivariable regression analysis.
NHANES. Age was categorized into
5-year groups to match the age distribu-
tion of the FOS and to provide reasonable
sample size in each age bin. All analyses
took into account differential probabili-
ties of selection and the complex sample
design. Sampling weights adjust for un-
equal probabilities of selection resulting
from nonresponse and planned oversam-
pling of certain subgroups. Again, the
97.5th percentile of A1C was computed,
incorporating appropriate weighting of
the survey data (28). We used the method
of Korn and Graubard (28) to compute
95% CIs around the percentiles. Differ-
ences in mean A1C by age-group were
examined by ANOVA.
Analyses of FOS and NHANES data
were performed using SAS (version 9.1)
(29). SUDAAN (version 9.01) was used
for complex surveys.
RESULTS -- The FOS sample (n 
2,473) had a mean  SD age of 54.7 
0.2 years with 45.2% women and a BMI of
27.15  0.1 kg/m2. The NHANES popu-
lation included 3,270 nondiabetic partic-
ipants aged 47.1  0.6 years, 52% female,
and with a BMI of 28.01  0.14 kg/m2. Of
the 2,473 nondiabetic FOS subjects at
visit 5, 65.6% had NGT, 20.3% had IFG
only, 5.5% had IGT only, and 6.8% had
both IFG and IGT. Approximately 2%
(n  44) of FOS subjects in the nondia-
betic group met the criteria for diabetes
on the basis of 2-h postload glucose 200
mg/dl but were included so that FOS and
NHANES cohorts would be comparable.
Of the 3,270 nondiabetic NHANES par-
ticipants, 31.6% had IFG. (For the prev-
alence of IFG and IGT by age, see
supplemental Table A1, available in an
online appendix at http://dx.doi.org/10.
2337/dc08-0577.)
There was a significant positive asso-
ciation between mean A1C and age-
groups in the nondiabetic FOS and
NHANES populations (Ptrend
0.0001
for both) (Figs. 1A and B). In the FOS
population, a similar trend was observed
even after subjects with IFG and IGT were
excluded (Fig. 1C) (Ptrend
 0.0001) (Ta-
ble 1). To exclude diabetes using a more
strict definition in the FOS cohort, we an-
alyzed data from nondiabetic subjects
who had both FPG 126 mg/dl and 2-h
postload glucose 200 mg/dl. We ob-
served mean A1C results that were not
different by 0.02 points in any age cat-
egory compared with results obtained
when FPG 126 mg/dl alone was used to
define diabetes. The trend remained sig-
nificant at P  0.0001.
To determine whether FPG and 2-h
postload glucose contribute to the in-
crease in A1C observed with age, we an-
alyzed FPG and 2-h postload glucose by
age categories (supplemental Table A2,
available in the online appendix). In non-
diabetic subjects, we noted an 8 mg/dl
A1C and aging in individuals without diabetes
1992 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 31, NUMBER 10, OCTOBER 2008
rise in FPG in both FOS and NHANES
and a 35 mg/dl rise in 2-h postload glu-
cose in FOS. In FOS subjects with NGT,
FPG increased minimally and 2-h post-
load glucose increased by 15 mg/dl with
age.
There was no difference in BMI noted
across different age categories in either
FOS or NHANES. In both the FOS and
NHANES samples, there was a sex differ-
ence in the relationship between A1C and
increasing age. We performed multivari-
ate analyses to adjust for differences in
sex, BMI, fasting glucose, and 2-h post-
load glucose. In FOS nondiabetic and
NGT populations, the relationship be-
tween age and A1C remained unchanged
in models adjusting for sex, BMI, fasting
glucose, and 2-h postload glucose (sup-
plemental Table A3a in the online appen-
dix). Models adjusted for sex, BMI, and
FPG in NHANES resulted in similar
findings (supplemental Table A3b in the
online appendix). From the above-
mentioned multivariable linear regression
models, every 1-year increase in age was
associated with a 0.012-unit increase in
A1C per year in the FOS and a 0.010-unit
increase in the NHANES (P  0.001 for
both) nondiabetic sample. Analyses of the
FOS NGT subgroup (IFG and/or IGT ex-
cluded) showed a similar relationship be-
tween age and A1C (0.012-point A1C
increase per year, P  0.0001).
The longitudinal analysis in FOS in-
cluded a mean follow-up period of 6.7
years. An increase in A1C was observed in
every age-group between examinations 5
and 7 in both the nondiabetic subjects
and subjects with NGT (Table 2) (paired t
tests P  0.0001). Mean increases in A1C
of 0.024­0.043/year in each of the age-
groups in nondiabetic subjects and
0.020­0.045/year in subjects with NGT
over the 6.7-year period were observed.
The 97.5th percentiles for A1C by
5-year age-groups are shown for FOS and
NHANES in Table 1. Although the abso-
lute values are different for each cohort,
they rise with age, with the 97.5th upper
limits for 40 years being 6.1 and 5.7 for
FOS and NHANES, respectively, com-
pared with 6.61 and 6.20 for those aged
70 years. We explored whether the dif-
ferences in race distribution of the two
populations might explain the differences
in absolute A1C levels by analyzing data
from only non-Hispanic white NHANES
participants (74.7%). The 97.5th percen-
tile A1C remained similar to that of the
total NHANES population, with no more
than a 0.1-unit difference in 97.5th per-
centile A1C in each age category.

CONCLUSIONS -- We examined
whether A1C increases with age in several
ways: by examining two large and racially
different nondiabetic populations, by
studying a subset of subjects with no evi-
dent abnormalities of glucose metabo-
lism, and finally by examining a cohort of
nondiabetic subjects over time. The stud-
ies that have failed to demonstrate an as-
sociation between age and A1C used
diagnostic criteria to exclude diabetes that
are now outdated (14­17) or were small
and possibly underpowered (15­17). In
our study we used the most recent criteria
for diabetes diagnosis and large popula-
tion-based cohorts.
We found a consistent increase in
A1C with age in the cross-sectional anal-
yses of both FOS and NHANES 2001­
2004 nondiabetic populations. Our
longitudinal analysis of FOS nondiabetic
subjects confirmed an increase in A1C
with aging. The 0.03-point increase per
year in subjects with no abnormality in
glucose homeostasis was greater in mag-
nitude than expected from FOS examina-
tion 5 cross-sectional analysis, perhaps
related to the relative increase in obesity
among individuals of the FOS by the time
of examination 7. An increase in BMI was
noted in all age-groups, except for the
70 years age-group during that period
(data not shown). It is also possible that
subjects who returned for visit 7 may have
been different from subjects who did not
return. Results of our longitudinal analy-
sis are comparable with those for a previ-
ous analysis of the original Framingham
Heart Study, comprising parents of the
FOS population, in which a 0.28% point
increase in A1C over a 4- to 6-year period
was observed, with a greater increase ob-
served with increasing age (30). Even
though we found a small increase in FPG
and a more significant increase in 2-h
postload glucose values across age catego-
ries, we could not translate these into
mean blood glucose values to estimate the
corresponding rise in A1C across age cat-
egories. However, we accounted for vari-
ation with age of FPG and 2-h postload
glucose levels by performing multivariate
analyses. None of these adjustments ma-
terially affected the association of age cat-
egory with change in A1C.
In the current study, the upper limit
(97.5th percentile) of A1C could be as
high as 6.83% in older nondiabetic sub-
jects and 6.60% in older subjects with no
detectable abnormality of glucose ho-
meostasis on standard testing. Despite us-
ing similar methodology to determine the
97.5th percentile A1C in the FOS and
NHANES nondiabetic populations, the
97.5th percentile A1C was slightly higher
in the FOS population than in the
NHANES population, even though statis-
tically significant increases with age were
noted in both populations. Differences in
assays and in the study populations, in-
cluding their different racial composi-
tions, and differences in the proportion of
subjects with dysglycemic states (supple-
mental Table A1) may have contributed to
the difference observed. The similar rela-
tive increase with age in both cohorts
strengthens the conclusion that A1C lev-
els increase with age. Moreover, the data
from both the NHANES and the FOS en-
hance the generalizability of our results.
The age-related increase in A1C ob-
served in our study is similar in magni-
tude to that in two previous studies: one
in Japan (8) and one in a very small (n 
109) convenience cohort in the U.S. (10).
Of the studies that have demonstrated an
association between A1C and older age,
many have been performed in selected
samples (6­9,12). Some have inadver-
tently included subjects with diabetes by
not screening the populations for diabetes
with fasting or postchallenge glucose lev-
els (6,8,10). Inclusion of subjects with
IGT and/or IFG in previous studies may
have contributed to the rise in A1C ob-
served. In the current study, even after
excluding subjects with the categorical
dysglycemic states of IGT and IFG and
controlling for the rise in FPG and 2-h
postload glucose with age, we still ob-
served an increase in A1C with age.
A possible explanation for the ob-
served association of higher A1C with in-
creasing age in individuals with NGT is
that factors unrelated to glucose metabo-
lism are affecting A1C levels. One such
explanation may be changes in the rate of
glycation associated with aging (12,13).
There is no evidence for decreased red cell
turnover owing to decreased clearance
with aging as a possible explanation. A
2-h OGTT may not adequately capture
postprandial glycemic excursions in el-
derly individuals. It is possible that other
factors such as worsening kidney function
with aging or anemia could be playing a
role; however, these are less likely to play
a significant role in healthy aging adults.
As in other studies (9), sex differences
were noted in the relationship between
A1C and age. It is possible that this find-
ing is related to lower hemoglobin levels
in menstruating women with more rapid
erythrocyte turnover, as suggested previ-
ously (9). Women in peri- and postmeno-
pausal age-groups had a steeper slope
than men.
Even though the association of A1C
with complications is well established in
individuals with diabetes (31) and in non-
diabetic subjects (32,33), the clinical sig-
nificance of increased A1C in the subset of
older individuals who have no evidence of
glucose intolerance is unknown. Current
treatment targets for patients with diabe-
tes are similar regardless of age. A study
designed to address the question of age-
specific treatment targets would be neces-
sary to determine whether treatment
targets should be different.
There are several limitations of this
study. First, the differences in sampling
strategies for the two studies precluded
combining the data from both. Second,
although both studies used an A1C assay
that was standardized by the National
Glycohemoglobin Standardization Pro-
gram (27), different laboratories per-
formed the FOS and NHANES assays and

a comparison of the absolute A1C values
may be problematic. Furthermore, the
age distribution and prevalence of dys-
glycemic states in the two studies differed,
and this may also have affected the abso-
lute A1C levels in the two studies. Our
sample size was smaller at the extremes of
age, and we therefore combined all sub-
jects who were 70 years old to have an
analyzable sample size in all age catego-
ries. Finally, we did not account for the
prevalence of other conditions that could
affect A1C in either study population, in-
cluding anemia and its treatment and kid-
ney dysfunction; however, their effect is
likely to be small overall. Despite these
limitations, the similar impact of increas-
ing age on A1C in both populations pro-
vides confirmation of the relationship
between age and A1C in the nondiabetic
population.
In summary, in the current study, the
uniform results between FOS and
NHANES establish clearly that A1C in-
creases with age even after multivariate
adjustments for sex, fasting, and 2-h post-
load glucose. The finding of higher upper
limits of normal A1C in older individuals
suggests that nonglycemic factors may
contribute to the relationship of A1C with
age. If we bear in mind the fact that elderly
individuals have an increased risk for hy-
poglycemia and other medication side ef-
fects (22,23), the adoption of A1C targets
that are lower than age-appropriate non-
diabetic values may be associated with
more medication-associated complica-
tions; however, a clinical study directly
addressing the question of whether A1C
should be age adjusted is needed. We rec-
ommend that further studies be under-
taken to determine whether the increase
in A1C associated with age in subjects
with normal glucose tolerance is of clini-
cal significance and to clarify whether
age-specific diagnostic and treatment cri-
teria would be appropriate.
