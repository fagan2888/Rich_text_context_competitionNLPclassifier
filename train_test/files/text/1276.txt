Objective. To determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among patients with gout and to examine the association
between the 2 conditions in a nationally representative sample of US adults.
Methods. Using data from 8,807 participants age >20 years in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (1988­1994), we determined the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among individuals with gout and quantified
the magnitude of association between the 2 conditions. We used both the revised and original National Cholesterol
Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) criteria to define metabolic syndrome.
Results. The prevalence (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) of metabolic syndrome according to revised NCEP/ATP III
criteria was 62.8% (51.9­73.6) among individuals with gout and 25.4% (23.5­27.3) among individuals without gout. Using
2002 census data, 3.5 million US adults with a history of gout have metabolic syndrome. The unadjusted and age- and
sex-adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) of metabolic syndrome for individuals with gout were 4.96 (3.17­7.75) and 3.05
(2.01­4.61), respectively. With the original NCEP/ATP criteria, the corresponding prevalences were slightly lower,
whereas the corresponding odds ratios were slightly higher. The stratified prevalences of metabolic syndrome by major
associated factors of gout (i.e., body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes) remained substantially and significantly
higher among those with gout than those without gout (all P values <0.05).
Conclusion. These findings indicate that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is remarkably high among individuals
with gout. Given the serious complications associated with metabolic syndrome, this frequent comorbidity should be
recognized and taken into account in long-term treatment and overall health of individuals with gout.

INTRODUCTION
Metabolic syndrome, which consists of multiple interre-
lated conditions, increases the risk for atherosclerotic car-
diovascular disease up to 3 times and increases the risk for
type 2 diabetes up to 5 times (1,2). Metabolic syndrome
also increases mortality from cardiovascular disease and
all causes (3,4). The syndrome affects 50 million Amer-
icans (2,5).
The potential link between gout, a common inflamma-
tory arthritis, and metabolic syndrome has been repeatedly
suggested (6­8), but no quantitative population data are
available; therefore, the magnitude of the problem remains
unclear. The proposed connection has been supported by
the close association between hyperuricemia and insulin
resistance syndrome (6,9,10). For example, a cross-sec-
tional study of 4,053 young adults found close associations
between hyperuricemia and the individual metabolic ab-
normalities of the syndrome including hyperinsulinemia,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity (10). Renal clear-
ance of urate is inversely related to the degree of insulin
resistance (11). Therefore, the reduced renal excretion of
urate among patients with metabolic syndrome may ex-
plain the increased frequency of hyperuricemia. Further-
more, recent case series reported that the prevalence of
metabolic syndrome was high among patients with gout

(82% in Mexican men [12] and 44% in Korean men [13]
compared with 5% in the Korean general population [14]).
Although these hospital-based case series (12,13) may
have included patients who are sicker than individuals
from the general population, the totality of available infor-
mation points toward a strong link between gout and met-
abolic syndrome. Because the serious implications of met-
abolic syndrome for overall health of individuals with
gout are substantial, we determined the prevalence of the
syndrome among patients with gout and examined the
association between the 2 conditions based on the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES-III).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population. Conducted between 1988 and 1994,
the NHANES-III included a representative sample of the
noninstitutionalized US civilian population, which was
selected using a multistage, stratified sampling design.
Persons 60 years of age and African American and Mex-
ican American persons were oversampled. After a home
interview, participants were invited to attend examination
sessions where blood and urine specimens were obtained.
In the current study, we analyzed data for 8,807 men and
nonpregnant women at least 20 years of age who attended
the medical examination, had fasted at least 8 hours prior
to the blood collection, and had complete information to
allow definition of the metabolic syndrome (4) and gout
status.
Assessment of metabolic syndrome. We used both the
revised and original National Cholesterol Education Pro-
gram Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) criteria to
define the metabolic syndrome. According to the original
NCEP/ATP III criteria (4,15), participants with 3 of the
following criteria were defined as having metabolic syn-
drome: abdominal obesity (waist circumference 102 cm
in men and 88 cm in women), hypertriglyceridemia
(150 mg/dl [1.69 mmoles/liter]), low high-density li-
poprotein (HDL) cholesterol (40 mg/dl [1.04 mmoles/
liter] in men and 50 mg/dl [1.29 mmoles/liter] in
women), high blood pressure (130/85 mm Hg), and high
fasting glucose (110 mg/dl [6.1 mmoles/liter]). We
counted participants who reported currently using antihy-
pertensive or antidiabetic medication (insulin or oral
agents) as participants with high blood pressure or diabe-
tes, respectively (4). Because the original NCEP/ATP III
criteria have recently been revised to require a lower fast-
ing glucose level (i.e., 100 mg/dl [5.6 mmoles/liter])
(1,16), we report results obtained using the original criteria
as well as those obtained using the revised criteria in this
study. Serum triglycerides were measured enzymatically
after hydrolyzation to glycerol (Hitachi 704 Analyzer; Hi-
tachi, Tokyo, Japan). HDL cholesterol was measured fol-
lowing the precipitation of other lipoproteins with a hep-
arin-manganese chloride mixture (Hitachi 704 Analyzer)
(17). Serum glucose concentration was measured using an
enzymatic reaction (Cobas Mira assay; Roche, Basel, Swit-
zerland). Details about the laboratory procedures of all of
these tests are published elsewhere (17). Three blood pres-
sure readings were obtained in the mobile examination
center. The average of the second and third systolic and
diastolic blood pressure readings was used in the analyses.
Assessment of gout. During the home interview, all sub-
jects were asked, "Has a doctor ever told you that you had
gout?" Interviewers were instructed to emphasize the
word doctor. If the respondent stated that it was another
health professional who gave this diagnosis of gout, then
the answer was coded as no.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using survey commands of STATA, version 9
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) to incorporate sample
weights and adjust for clusters and strata of the complex
sample design. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was cal-
culated according to the presence of gout. We performed
logistic regression to evaluate the association between
presence of gout and presence of metabolic syndrome and
calculated unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and age- and sex-
adjusted ORs. We also stratified the results by major asso-
ciated factors of gout including body mass index (BMI)
26.2 kg/m2 (median value) versus 26.2 kg/m2, hyper-
tension (high blood pressure as defined above or antihy-
pertensive medication use), and diabetes (by self report of
a physician diagnosis or fasting glucose 126 mg/dl
[6.99 mmoles/liter]). For all measures, we calculated
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). All P values are
2-sided.
RESULTS
The mean age was 44 years, 49.7% were men, 76.5% were
white, and the mean BMI was 26.4 kg/m2. The mean uric
acid level was 5.42 mg/dl (95% CI 5.37­5.46 mg/dl). The
cross-sectional prevalence of hyperuricemia (i.e., serum
uric acid 7.0 mg/dl for men and 6.0 mg/dl for women)
was 49.1% (95% CI 39.5­58.7) among individuals with
gout and 18.0% (95% CI 16.9­19.1) among those without
gout. A diagnosis of gout by a physician was reported by
2.4% (95% CI 2.0­2.9) of participants. The mean age of
participants with gout was 57.6 years, 72% were men,
86.3% were white, and the mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m2.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to the
revised NCEP/ATP III criteria (1,16) was 62.8% (95% CI
51.9­73.6) among individuals with gout and 25.4% (95%
CI 23.5­27.3) among individuals without gout (Table 1).
The prevalence among individuals who had gout and were
exposed to allopurinol or uricosuric agents was higher
(83.3%; 95% CI 71.1­95.4). The unadjusted and age- and
sex-adjusted ORs of metabolic syndrome for individuals
with gout were 4.96 (95% CI 3.17­7.75) and 3.05 (95% CI
2.01­4.61), respectively (Table 1). Using the original
NCEP/ATP III criteria (4,15), the corresponding preva-
lences were slightly lower, whereas the corresponding
ORs were slightly higher. The prevalence of metabolic
syndrome among individuals with gout did not appear to
110 Choi et al
differ substantially between men and women. The preva-
lence increased from 27% among participants with gout
ages 20­39 years to 71% among participants 40 years
of age (Table 1). Application of the age-specific prevalence
rates to US census counts from 2002 indicated that of the
5.9 million US adults with a history of gout, 3.5 million
US adults have metabolic syndrome according to the re-
vised NCEP/ATP criteria (1,16).
Prevalences of individual metabolic abnormalities ac-
cording to the presence of gout are summarized in Table 2.
The prevalence ranged from 33.1% for fasting glucose
110 mg/dl or hypoglycemic medication use to 69.1% for
high blood pressure or antihypertensive medication use.
All prevalence rates of individual metabolic abnormalities
were substantially higher among persons with gout than
those without gout. All OR estimates for the association
between gout and each metabolic component were statis-
tically significant except for the age- and sex-adjusted ORs
for the more lenient insulin resistance criterion that re-
quired a fasting glucose level 100 mg/dl (Table 2).
We stratified the prevalence of metabolic syndrome by
major associated factors of gout (i.e., BMI, hypertension,
and diabetes) (Table 3). As expected, the prevalence of
metabolic syndrome was higher when these stratified fac-
tors were present. However, all stratified prevalence rates
remained substantially and significantly higher among in-
dividuals with gout than those without gout. For example,
age- and sex-adjusted ORs for the association between gout
and metabolic syndrome among individuals with BMI
lower than the median value (26.2 kg/m2) was 2.11 (95%
CI 1.21­3.67) according to the revised NCEP/ATP III cri-
teria (1,16) and 3.55 (95% CI 1.57­8.05) according to the
original criteria (15). The corresponding ORs among indi-
viduals without diabetes were 5.49 (95% CI 1.85­16.28)
and 2.78 (95% CI 1.90­4.09), respectively (Table 3). In
addition, when we repeated our analyses after excluding
persons with diuretic exposure (n  698, including 64
persons with gout), the prevalence of metabolic syndrome
according to the revised NCEP/ATP III criteria was 57.7%
(95% CI 44.5­70.9) among individuals with gout and
23.2% (95% CI 21.3­25.2) among individuals without
gout.

DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative sample of men and
women, we found that 60% of US adults with gout had
metabolic syndrome. Compared with adults without gout,
the prevalence was nearly 3 times higher among those
with gout. The prevalence of individual metabolic abnor-
malities was higher among persons with gout, and the link
persisted across the different subgroups stratified by BMI,
hypertension, and diabetes. Although these associations
have been suspected, this is the first population-based
study to demonstrate the strong association and quantify
the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among indi-
viduals with gout.
These data indicate that the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome is very high among individuals with gout. In
fact, the prevalence is substantially higher than among
those who experienced myocardial infarction or stroke
(41­44%) in the same NHANES study (18). These data
expand on previous studies that demonstrated a close
relationship between hyperuricemia and insulin resis-
tance syndrome (6,9,10), and on the recent case series of
gout and metabolic syndrome (12,13), thereby supporting
a pathogenetic overlap between these conditions. Higher
insulin levels are known to reduce renal excretion of urate
(11,19­21). For example, exogenous insulin can reduce
the renal excretion of urate in both healthy and hyperten-
sive subjects (6,19,20). Insulin may enhance renal urate
reabsorption via stimulation of urate-anion exchanger
URAT1 (22) and/or the Na-dependent anion cotrans-
porter in brush border membranes of the renal proximal
tubule (8). Additionally, because serum levels of leptin
and urate tend to increase together (23,24), some investi-
gators have suggested that leptin may affect renal reabsorp-
tion (8). Finally, in insulin resistance syndrome, impaired
oxidative phosphorylation may increase systemic adeno-
sine concentrations by increasing the intracellular levels
of coenzyme A esters of long-chain fatty acids (8). In-
creased adenosine, in turn, can result in renal retention of
sodium, urate, and water (25­28). Some researchers have
speculated that chronically increased extracellular adeno-
sine concentrations may also contribute to hyperuricemia
by increasing urate production (25).
There are several important clinical implications of our
results. First, a diagnosis of gout should trigger a high
clinical suspicion and investigation for a potential coex-
istence of metabolic syndrome. If present, the syndrome
needs to be recognized as a potentially more life-threaten-
ing factor than gout or hyperuricemia (6) given the serious
associated complications (1­4). The cornerstones of treat-
ment for the syndrome are the management of weight and
ensuring appropriate levels of physical activity (4). Recent
studies demonstrated that dietary modification and en-
hanced physical activity may delay or prevent the transi-
tion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes
mellitus and may provide relevant treatment paradigms
for patients with metabolic syndrome (4,29­31).
Long-term dietary recommendations for the majority of
patients with gout should take into account this frequent
comorbidity. For example, conventional dietary recom-
mendations for gout have focused on restriction of purine
intake, although low-purine diets are often high in carbo-
hydrate and saturated fat (7). These macronutrients are
associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance
syndrome and associated major consequences (21,32,33).
Furthermore, these macronutrients tend to lead to higher
serum insulin levels, which are known to reduce renal
excretion of urate (11,19­21), thus potentially raising the
serum uric acid level and the risk of gout. Given the
frequent association between gout and metabolic syn-
drome, it is imperative to develop appropriate dietary and
other lifestyle guidelines, taking into account risk of gouty
attacks as well as overall long-term health effects. Our data
also provide support for the value of the strategic choice of
certain therapies for patients with gout and metabolic syn-
drome or its individual components (8). For example, the
uricosuric property of fenofibrate (34) may be associated
with a favorable risk-benefit ratio among patients with
gout and metabolic syndrome (8). Similarly, antihyperten-
sive agents with uricosuric properties (e.g., losartan [34] or
amlodipine [35]) could have a better risk-benefit ratio than
diuretics for hypertension in hypertensive patients with
gout (8). In addition, the growing epidemic of obesity
(36,37) and metabolic syndrome (38) presents a substantial
challenge in the prevention and management of gout (8).
Because these conditions would likely also share impor-
tant parts of public health and clinical management ap-
proaches, future studies may need to focus on developing
the overall optimal strategies for improving these concur-
rent conditions.
Hyperuricemia is associated with cardiovascular disor-
ders (CVD), but whether it is an independent risk factor
with a pathogenic role in CVD or only a marker for asso-
ciated CVD risk factors, such as insulin resistance, obesity,
diuretic use, hypertension, and renal disease, is unclear
(39,40). Although a number of studies have investigated
the relationship between serum urate levels and CVD,
little information is available regarding the relationship
between gout and cardiovascular outcomes. The Framing-
ham Study reported that gout was associated with a 60%
increased risk of coronary artery disease in men (41), and
we are not aware of any other prospective data on this
important topic. The remarkably high prevalence of met-
abolic syndrome observed in our study suggests that indi-
viduals with gout are likely at increased risk for athero-
sclerotic cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (1,2),
the known complications of metabolic syndrome. Addi-
tional prospective data on these important outcomes
would be valuable.
Strengths and limitations of our study deserve comment.
This study was performed in a nationally representative
sample of US men and women; therefore, the findings are
likely to be generalizable to US men and women. The
self-reported diagnosis of gout by a physician was not
validated in this study. However, it is unlikely that mis-
classification of the diagnosis would explain the strong
associations observed in this population study. It remains
conceivable that the results may even be more striking
with more specific case definitions of gout, as was the case
in our prospective epidemiologic study of gout for sus-
pected associated factors (42,43). Nonetheless, confirming
these results using such specific case definitions of gout
Gout and the Metabolic Syndrome 113
would be valuable. The current study provides national
estimates of the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among
individuals with gout and the magnitude of the cross-
sectional association between the 2 conditions, which was
well served by the NHANES study design. Potential tem-
poral relationships between these disorders should be ad-
dressed by longitudinal studies.
In conclusion, these findings from a nationally represen-
tative sample of US adults indicate that the prevalence of
metabolic syndrome is remarkably high among individu-
als with gout. Given the serious complications associated
with metabolic syndrome, this frequent comorbidity
should be recognized and be taken into account in the
long-term treatment and overall health of individuals with
gout.
