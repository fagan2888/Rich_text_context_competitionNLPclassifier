Abstract
Background: Weight misperception might preclude the adoption of healthful weight-related attitudes and
behaviors among overweight and obese individuals, yet limited research exists in this area. We examined
associations between weight misperception and several weight-related attitudes and behaviors among a nationally
representative sample of overweight and obese US adults.
Methods: Data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used.
Analyses included non-pregnant, overweight and obese (measured body mass index  25) adults aged 20 and
older. Weight misperception was identified among those who reported themselves as "underweight" or "about the
right weight". Outcome variables and sample sizes were: weight-loss attitudes/behaviors (wanting to weigh less
and having tried to lose weight; n = 4,784); dietary intake (total energy intake; n = 4,894); and physical activity
(meets 2008 US physical activity recommendations, insufficiently active, and sedentary; n = 5,401). Multivariable
regression models were stratified by gender and race/ethnicity. Analyses were conducted in 2009-2010.
Results: These overweight/obese men and women who misperceived their weight were 71% (RR 0.29, 95% CI
0.25-0.34) and 65% (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.29-0.42) less likely to report that they want to lose weight and 60% (RR 0.40,
95% CI 0.30-0.52) and 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32-0.59) less likely to have tried to lose weight within the past year,
respectively, compared to those who accurately perceived themselves as overweight. Blacks were particularly less
likely to have tried to lose weight. Weight misperception was not a significant predictor of total energy intake
among most subgroups, but was associated with lower total energy intake among Hispanic women (change
-252.72, 95% CI -433.25, -72.18). Men who misperceived their weight were less likely (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89) to
be insufficiently active (the strongest results were among Black men) and women who misperceived their weight
were less likely (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54, 1.00, p = 0.047) to meet activity recommendations compared to being
sedentary.
Conclusion: Overall, weight misperception among overweight and obese adults was associated with less
likelihood of interest in or attempts at weight loss and less physical activity. These associations varied by gender
and race/ethnicity. This study highlights the importance of focusing on inaccurate weight perceptions in targeted
weight loss efforts.

Background
At almost 70%, the prevalence of overweight and obesity
continues to be at epidemic proportions in the US [1].
Given that overweight and obesity increase the risk for
many leading chronic diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, kidney dis-
ease, several types of cancer) [2] and premature morality
[2,3], it remains one of today's most pressing public
health and medical priorities.
Misperception of weight status (i.e. discordance between
an individual's actual weight status and the perception of
his/her weight status) has repeatedly been documented
among overweight and obese adults [4-21]. It has been
hypothesized that weight misperception among overweight
and obese individuals may preclude the adoption of health-
ful attitudes and behaviors [4-11,13,15-17,19,22-27], per-
haps as a result of lower weight loss motivation.
Overweight and obese individuals who see themselves as
healthy weight, for example, might not try to lose weight
and might be less inclined to eat healthfully and be physi-
cally active. Surprisingly, however, little is known empiri-
cally about the influence of weight misperception on
weight-related attitudes and behaviors among overweight
and obese individuals; most studies on weight mispercep-
tion usually only examine prevalence estimates of weight
misperception by socio-demographic factors (e.g. gender
and race/ethnicity). The limited available evidence indicates
that inaccurate weight perceptions among overweight and
obese individuals are associated with weight-related atti-
tudes (such as eating concern and weight concern) [28]
and weight-related behaviors (such as fewer weight loss
attempts [29], unhealthful dietary intake [28-31] and lower
physical activity levels) [29,30] ­ key components inhibiting
weight maintenance and loss. However, some evidence
indicates that weight misperception among overweight and
obese individuals might be associated with healthful beha-
viors (e.g. better diet quality [29], more physical activity
[29], and less sedentary behavior [32].
Using data from the 2003-2006 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we sought to
examine associations between weight misperception and
several weight-related attitudes and behaviors (i.e. wanting
to weigh less, having tried to lose weight, dietary intake,
and physical activity) among overweight and obese US
adults. We hypothesized that overweight and obese weight
misperceivers would have unhealthful weight loss attitudes
and behaviors (including decreased desire to weigh less,
decreased attempts to have tried to lose weight, higher
caloric intake and lower physical activity levels).
Methods
Study Design and Population
Data for this study come from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. NHANES is an on-
going annual survey of health and nutritional status col-
lected from a stratified, multi-stage probability sample
of the civilian non-institutionalized US population, with
an oversampling of targeted groups (including Blacks
and Mexican-Americans) [33,34]. This study draws from
two consecutive cycles of nationally representative data
from 2003-2006, comprising 10,122 individuals inter-
viewed in 2003-2004 and 10,348 individuals in 2005-
2006. The study population was limited to non-preg-
nant, overweight and obese (measured body mass index
[BMI]  25 using the formula: weight in kilograms
divided by the square of height in meters; height and
weight were measured under standard protocols) [35,36]
adults aged 20 and older. To increase statistical power,
we used a three-sample strategy in which the sample
size was maximized in for each outcome type. Sample 1
was composed of overweight and obese adults who
completed the weight loss attitudes/behaviors survey
items (n = 4,784); sample 2 was composed of overweight
and obese adults who completed the dietary intake sur-
vey items (n = 4,894); and sample 3 was composed of
overweight and obese adults who completed the physical
activity questionnaire (n = 5,401). This three-sample
strategy helps us avoid any bias associated with conduct-
ing a complete case analysis.
Weight Misperception
Respondents were asked if they considered themselves
now to be "overweight, underweight, or about the right
weight." Given the restriction of the sample to the over-
weight and obese, weight misperception (our predictor
variable) was determined among those who reported
themselves to be "underweight" or "about the right
weight"; those who correctly perceived themselves as
overweight served as the referent group.
Weight-Related Attitudes and Behaviors
Three types of weight-related outcomes were examined:
(1) weight loss attitudes/behaviors, (2) dietary intake and
(3) physical activity. Weight loss attitudes/behaviors
were captured using two binary variables: whether the
respondent would like to weigh less (yes/weigh less or
no/stay about the same), and whether he/she had tried
to lose weight in the last year (yes/no). The dietary vari-
able we examined was total energy intake (kcals). Energy
intake were assessed as continuous variables using 24-
hour recall data, averaging the values from 2 non-conse-
cutive days of recall to capture usual intake (day 1 was
administered in person during the physical examination,
whereas day 2 was administered by phone a few weeks
later). Physical activity was assessed using frequency
(per month), duration (minutes) and intensity (metabolic

equivalent [MET]) data on specific reported leisure-time
activities for each individual. A 3-level variable was
defined based on the 2008 U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services' physical activity guidelines [37],
where "meets activity recommendations" was defined as
achieving 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity phy-
sical activity (3.0-5.9 METs) or 75 minutes/week of vig-
orous intensity physical activity (6.0+ METs) or an
equivalent combination thereof (500 MET-min/week 
3.0 METs). Those categorized as "insufficiently active"
reported activity that did not exceed the above thresh-
olds; respondents who did not report any leisure-time
physical activity were categorized as "sedentary."
Other Variables
Other variables used to define sample subgroups and/or
as model covariates include: gender (male, female), race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, or
Hispanic; other groups were excluded due to small sam-
ple sizes), age (years), annual household income (<
$20,000, $20-35,000, $35-75,000 and $75,000+), educa-
tion (<high school, high school graduate, some college,
college graduate+), marital status (never married,
widowed/divorced, married), self-rated health (fair/poor,
good, very good/excellent), whether a physician or
health professional had ever told the respondent that
he/she was overweight (yes, no) as well as physical activ-
ity and BMI (both previously described).
Statistical Analyses
Multivariable regression models were used to examine
the association between weight misperception and each
outcome. The form of regression was dependent on the
distribution of the outcome variables. Binary and catego-
rical variables were modeled using log-Poisson and mul-
tinomial logistic regression (respectively), whereas
continuous variables were modeled via linear regression.
Log-Poisson regression results for each binary outcome
were exponentiated to a relative risk (RR). Relative risks
(i.e., prevalence ratios) were calculated rather than odds
ratios because the outcomes (i.e. wanting to weigh less
and having tried to lose weight) are common among
our study population of overweight and obese indivi-
duals; odds ratios are likely to overestimate the effect
when the outcome is common [38-41]. Since the Pois-
son model specification may overinflate the standard
error, we conducted sensitivity analysis using jacknife
variance as the robust variance estimator to deflate
them, however, the estimates and p values replicated
were near identical as our initial standard approach (we
therefore present findings from our initial approach).
Multinomial logistic regression models for the 3-level
physical activity outcome variable were used to estimate
the likelihood of "meeting activity recommendations" or
being "insufficiently active" relative to being "sedentary"
(outcome referent) for those who misperceived their
weight relative to those who correctly perceived their
weight (exposure referent). We fit multinomial logistic
regression models as opposed to ordinal logistic regres-
sion models because the intervals between the 3-level
physical activity outcome variable were not equal and
because initial exploratory data analysis revealed that
the continuous physical activity variable was heavily
skewed towards zero and the non-zero observations are
continuous rather than ordinal, making other strategies
inappropriate. Coefficients from these models were
exponentiated to obtain estimates of the relative risk of
each physical activity outcome as a function of weight
misperception. Linear regressions produced beta coeffi-
cients estimating the change in the continuous total
energy intake outcome based on weight misperception.
In these models, we control for physical activity because
because it is a predictor of dietary intake [42]. We also
adjust for BMI in all models, given that misperception
varies by actual BMI [11] and given that BMI influences
the study outcomes [42-44]. All models were conducted
for the entire sample as well as stratified by gender and
race/ethnicity, since 1) we were interested in parameter
estimates by gender and race/ethnicity, 2) there
are gender and racial/ethnic differences in weight mis-
perception among overweight/obese individuals
[4-9,11,13,14,16-21,26] and 3) there are gender and
racial/ethnic differences in weight-related attitudes and
behaviors among overweight/obese individuals [8,45,46].
Statistical significance was determined by 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) and p values less than 0.05. All
analyses were conducted in 2009-2010 using STATA
statistical software (version 10.0; Stata Corp, College
Station, Texas), with survey procedures to correct for
unequal probability of selection and underestimation of
variance due to clustered sample design.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Population
Socio-demographic characteristics of the study population
of overweight and obese US adults for the three outcomes
are presented in Table 1. Slightly over half were over-
weight (50.1 to 51.5%). Approximately 23% misperceived
their weight. More than half were male and about three-
quarters of respondents were non-Hispanic White. The
mean age was about 48 years. Most individuals (>80%)
had high school education or greater and also earned over
$20,000 annually. A little over 65% were currently married.
The majority of these overweight and obese individuals
reported "good" (34.1 to 35.2%), "very good" or "excellent"
self-rated health (46.0 to 47.3%); only about 40% reported
receiving a physician diagnosis of overweight. Additionally,
most of these overweight and obese individuals (80.6%)

wanted to lose weight and 47.4% had tried to lose weight
in the past year. The mean total energy intake of the study
population was 2138.5 kcals (SE: 22.2). About one-third
(33.8%) were sedentary, 25.2% were insufficiently activity
and 41.0% reported meeting physical activity
recommendations.
Effect of Weight Misperception on Weight Loss Attitudes
and Behaviors
Weight misperception was a strong predictor of weight
loss attitudes and behaviors for both genders and all
racial/ethnic groups (Table 2). Men and women who
misperceived their weight were 71% (RR 0.29, 95% CI
0.25-0.34) and 65% (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.29-0.42) less
likely, respectively, to report wanting to lose weight than
those who accurately perceived themselves as over-
weight. Similarly, men and women who misperceived
their overweight status were 60% (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30-
0.52) and 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32-0.59) less likely
than those who accurately perceived their overweight
status to have attempted weight loss during the past
year. Weight misperception was a particularly strong

predictor among Blacks. Black men and women who
misperceived their weight were 77% less likely to have
tried to lose weight in the past year compared to Blacks
who accurately perceived themselves as overweight.
Based on within-group comparisons, this compares to a
62% reduction among Hispanic men, a 33% reduction
among Hispanic women, a 55% reduction among White
men, and a 56% reduction among White women.
Effect of Weight Misperception on Dietary Intake and
Physical Activity
Weight misperception was not a significant predictor of
total energy intake among most subgroups (Table 3).
Among Hispanic women, however, weight mispercep-
tion was associated with lower total energy intake
(change -252.72, 95% CI -433.25, -72.18). Weight mis-
perception was a predictor of physical activity among
certain gender and racial/ethnic groups. As compared to
men who accurately perceive themselves as overweight,
men who misperceived their weight were 32% less likely
(RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.89) to be insufficiently active
and as likely to meet activity recommendations as com-
pared to being sedentary. The strongest results were
among Black men. Black men who misperceived their
weight as compared to Black men who accurately per-
ceived their weight were 51% less likely (RR 0.49, CI
0.26-0.90) to be insufficiently active and as likely to
meet activity recommendations compared to being
sedentary; this compares to a reduction of 30% among
White men (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-1.00, p = 0.049).
Weight misperception was not a significant predictor of
insufficient activity among women of any racial/ethnic
group and there was no significant effect of weight mis-
perception on the odds of meeting activity recommen-
dations compared to being sedentary among men.
However, women who misperceived their weight as

weight were 26% less likely (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54, 1.00,

weight misperceivers were less physically active than
those who accurately perceived their weight.
Discussion
Weight misperception among overweight and obese
populations is of public health and medical significance
and may limit the effectiveness of weight loss and obe-
sity prevention efforts. Nearly one-quarter of our repre-
sentative US sample of overweight and obese adults
misperceived their weight status. In this study, over-
weight and obese individuals who misperceived their
weight status were less likely to want to lose weight and
having tried to lose weight as compared to overweight
and obese individuals who accurately perceived their
weight. This effect was apparent among both men and
women and among all racial/ethnic groups, but was
especially pronounced for Black men and women.
Weight misperception was not a significant predictor of
dietary behaviors for most subgroups, but was associated
with lower total energy intake among Hispanic women.
Additionally, men (especially Black men) who misper-
ceived their weight as compared those who accurately
perceived their weight were less likely to be insuffi-
ciently active compared to being sedentary and women
who misperceived their weight as compared to women
who accurately perceived their weight were less likely to
meet activity recommendations compared to being
sedentary. Importantly, this is the first study, to the best
of our knowledge, to have examined weight mispercep-
tion in relation to a variety of weight-related attitudes
and behaviors among a nationally representative sample
of overweight and obese men and women in the US.
Findings from our study are largely consistent with the
few existing studies in this area. Jones et al., for exam-
ple, found that adults with class II obesity (BMI = 35.0-
39.9) who had inaccurate weight perceptions had less
weight concern, less distress regarding overeating, less
distress regarding control overeating, less emotional
overeating, less eating disinhibition as well as exhibited
a nonsignificant trend toward less time spent dieting
[28]. Forman et al. found that overweight adults who
misperceived themselves as average weight were dieting
less often than those who correctly perceived their
weight status [31]. In a study of overweight adolescents
with type 2 diabetes, Skinner et al. found that those who
misperceived their weight had poorer diet such as
higher consumption of sugary drinks, eating fast food,
having unplanned snacks, and overeating along with low
levels of physical activity and more sedentary time [30].
Edwards et al. found that overweight adolescents in the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey who accurately perceived
their weight were more likely to report trying to lose
weight as well as more likely to exercise and consume
fewer calories in the past 30 days, but overweight boys
who accurately perceived their weight were also less
likely to report achieving recommended levels of fruit/
vegetable intake and physical activity in the previous
week [29]. Taken together, these findings suggest the
importance of considering weight perceptions in the
design of future behavioral weight loss interventions.
Theories of health behavior provide a useful lens to
interpret these findings. Several widely used theories
such as the Health Belief Model [47] suggest that per-
ceived susceptibility to a given condition is necessary to
promote healthful behavior change. Consistent with
health behavior theory, our findings show that mispercei-
vers are less likely to plan or attempt weight loss, and
more likely to overall perform behaviors that increase
their likelihood of experiencing weight gain. One notable
caveat is our finding that Hispanic women who misper-
ceived their weight status had lower energy intake than
those who correctly perceive their weight. However, our
overall findings and those of others by and large [28-31]
suggest that correcting perception of weight status may
be an important consideration in the design of weight
loss interventions, particularly those conducted among
high-risk subgroups. Intervention efforts are especially
needed for overweight and obese men and Black adults,
given the groups' high prevalence of weight mispercep-
tion [4-9,11,13,14,16-21,26], their elevated rates of over-
weight and obesity [1], and their consistent and strong
associations of weight misperception in relation to
unhealthful weight-related attitudes and behaviors seen
in the present study. We also note that the misperception
that should cause the greatest concern is that of extre-
mely obese individuals (almost 50% of our representative
sample is obese) for whom, independent of racial/ethnic
group, elevated health risks are most certain [48,49].
Weight misperceptions are potentially modifiable.
There are several possible strategies for counteracting
misperceptions in the primary care setting and in line
with these findings only about 40% of the overweight
and obese respondents in our sample reported being
told by a physician or health professional that they were
overweight. However, when provider counseling occurs,
it can be particularly helpful. Several studies have shown
that when clinicians advise their obese patients to lose
weight, there is an increased likelihood of weight loss
attempts [50,51]. Additionally, the clothing industry
might be encouraged to revisit shared clothing sizing
standards. The elimination of "vanity sizing" (also
known as size inflation, whereby clothing size numbers
scale down over time; e.g. a size 14 becomes a size 10)
[52] might reduce weight misperception ­ as some

individuals monitor their weight with clothing sizes [53].
Marketing campaigns changing societal norms that
encourage weight misperception also could be imple-
mented. Such norms exist among men (e.g. overweight
men have greater body image satisfaction [19,54,55] and
men value heavier body weight) [18,21,26,27,56] and
certain racial/ethnic minority groups (e.g. Blacks have
greater body image satisfaction independent of their
body weight [57-61] and maintain a greater social accep-
tance of heavier body weight) [61-65]. However, it is
important to note that such intervention efforts should
be carefully crafted to protect against eating disorders,
body image disorders and emotional distress, as these
responses may be experienced when weight mispercep-
tions are corrected.
We note that this study also is subject to some limita-
tions. First, many of the gender- and racial/ethnic-strati-
fied models yielded wide confidence intervals and null
associations (e.g. all models estimating total energy
intake had very wide confidence intervals and we specu-
late the effect estimates from the energy intake models
are unstable); although we maximized the sample size
for each analysis for increased power and to avoid any
bias by not doing so, lack of power due to smaller sam-
ple sizes in these cells might be implicated in the find-
ings. Second, the cross-sectional design of this study
does not allow causal conclusions to be drawn. How-
ever, despite the well-known limitations of cross-sec-
tional data, our study hypotheses and directionality have
intuitive appeal and were based on conclusions from
past theoretical and empirical research. Additionally, we
relied on self-reported data on health behaviors (i.e. diet
and physical activity). Although there can be reliability
and validity challenges with self-reported dietary and
physical activity measures [66-69] (which may be espe-
cially problematic among overweight and obese indivi-
duals), this type of data is most commonly used in
population-based health research. We report only on lei-
sure-time physical activity, which is only one domain of
physical activity behavior and may vary by socio-demo-
graphic characteristics, especially race/ethnicity [70,71].
BMI was used in this study, as is commonly done in
population-based research. Nevertheless, previous
research has noted that BMI is an imperfect measure of
body composition that does not take into account body
fat distribution or body fatness (e.g. the ratio of muscle
to fat) [72], which overweight and obese individuals are
likely to take into consideration when determining their
own weight status [14] and it may vary by gender and
race/ethnicity. The possibility of temporal differences in
the time since receipt of diagnosis exists because the
medical diagnosis of overweight was not time-delimited
(e.g. prior 12 months). Furthermore, as with all
observational studies, the possibility of residual con-
founding cannot be eliminated. However, we adjusted
for multiple potential confounding variables in this
study. Lastly, Mexicans were largely overrepresented in
NHANES and therefore these results might not be gen-
eralizeable to other Hispanic subgroups.
The outcomes we selected for this study are reflec-
tive of attitudes and behaviors that are necessary for
successful weight loss. As such, to enhance the inter-
pretability of our findings, we chose behaviors that are
most directly related to weight regulation: total calories
and energy expenditure (however other behavioral
aspects might be relevant to weight misperception).
There is a need for additional research to replicate,
extend and contextualize our findings. As the few stu-
dies examining weight misperception in relation to
weight-related attitudes and behaviors were cross-sec-
tional, longitudinal study designs are needed to estab-
lish the temporal ordering of study variables. It is
important to note that weight misperception can be
examined in multiple ways [22]. In our study, further-
more we do not know what respondents were using as
a reference point when reporting weight status.
Respondents might have compared themselves with
their personal standards of a desired size (which might
be based on cultural ideals and/or the size of their
family or friends), medical standards of a certain
weight for height (e.g. statements from a physician) or
some other standard. Finally, in order to correct
weight misperception, research is needed to examine
causes of weight misperception among overweight and
obese individuals (which have yet to be fully eluci-
dated). Social comparison might be an explanation for
weight misperception. Research indicates that being
exposed to obesity is associated with greater weight
misperception (underestimation) [24] and that
increased obesity prevalence rates over the years has
been associated with fewer overweight individuals per-
ceiving themselves as overweight [5,73,74], increased
body weight norms [4,73], and increased desired and
ideal weights [25,75]. Additionally, we note that weight
misperceptions might differ between groups because
some experience a weaker BMI-mortality gradient than
others (e.g. obesity­until the extreme range­is less
lethal for Blacks as compared to Whites) [48].
Conclusion
Overall, we found that weight misperception among
overweight and obese adults was associated with less
likelihood of interest in or attempts at weight loss and
less physical activity. These associations varied by gen-
der and race/ethnicity. This study highlights the impor-
tance of focusing on inaccurate weight perceptions in
