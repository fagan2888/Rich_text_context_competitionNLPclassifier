Abstract
Medicare Advantage was implemented in 2004 and the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) program was implemented in
Florida during 2005. Both increase surveillance of medical necessity and deny payments for improper admissions. The purpose
of the present study was to determine their potential impact on for-profit (FP) and not-for-profit (NFP) hospital operating
margins in Florida. FP hospitals were expected to be more adversely affected as admissions growth has been one strategy
to improve stock performance, which is not a consideration at NFPs. This study analyzed Florida community hospitals from
2000 through 2010, assessing changes in pre-tax operating margin (PTOM). Florida Agency for Health Care Administration
data were analyzed for 104 community hospitals (62 FPs and 42 NFPs). Academic, public, and small hospitals were excluded.
A mixed-effects model was used to assess the association of RAC implementation, organizational and payer type variables,
and ownership interaction effects on PTOM. FP hospitals began the period with a higher average PTOM, but converged
with NFPs during the study period. The average Medicare Advantage effect was not significant for either ownership type.
The magnitude of the RAC variable was significantly negative for average PTOM at FPs (-4.68) and positive at NFPs (0.08),
meaning RAC was associated with decreasing PTOM at FP hospitals only. RAC complements other Medicare surveillance
systems that detect medically unnecessary admissions, coding errors, fraud, and abuse. Since its implementation in Florida,
average FP and NFP operating margins have been similar, such that the higher margins reported for FP hospitals in the 1990s
are no longer evident.

Introduction
During the 1990s, for-profit (FP) hospitals in Florida were
found to achieve significantly higher margins than not-for-
profit (NFP) hospitals, measured as either operating margin
or basic earning power.1,2 The purpose of the present study
was to determine whether FP hospitals sustained their oper-
ating profit advantage following the heightened scrutiny of
medical necessity from Medicare Advantage and Medicare's
Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) programs, and to assess
the association of these two Medicare programs on operating
profitability at FPand NFPhospitals. Both programs heighten
surveillance of medical necessity and deny payments for
unnecessary hospital admissions.
Medicare Advantage was enacted in December 2003,
enhancing benefits and managed care options to beneficia-
ries. In Florida, Medicare Advantage enrollment increased
from 18% in 2004 to 36% in 2013.3,4 Medicare Advantage
plans approve or deny payment for member services, typi-
cally prospectively. An incentive exists to deny funding for
medicalservicesdeemedunnecessaryasMedicareAdvantage
plans are private companies that must assure their own finan-
cial success,.
As Medicare Advantage plans typically deny medically
unnecessary admissions prospectively, neither revenue nor
2 INQUIRY
expense is incurred for a disallowed admission because the
admission does not occur. Nonetheless, a hospital's pre-tax
operating margin (PTOM) can be affected. The PTOM mea-
sures a hospital's ability to generate revenue while control-
ling for expense. When an admission is denied, a hospital is
precluded from generating earnings, where earnings are
maximized from increasing revenue while controlling for
expense. In general, admissions deemed unnecessary may
have been more profitable as patients had acuity levels deter-
mined inappropriate for admission, meaning if reimbursed at
inpatient rates, such patients should be profitable, on aver-
age. Furthermore, when fewer patients are admitted, fixed
costs are spread among fewer patients, thus increasing the
average cost per patient.
During 2005, a 3-year RAC pilot program was imple-
mented in Florida, California, and New York, which
affected Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients. In 2007,
the pilot program was expanded to include 3 additional
states. The 6-state pilot concluded in 2008. Independent
RAC contractors examined Medicare admissions to detect
improper overpayments and underpayments. Overpayment
occurred when a provider's claim did not meet Medicare's
medical necessity or coding requirements, and payment
was then denied retrospectively. When underpayments
were detected, the amount was reimbursed to the provider.
The 6-state RAC pilot detected $1 billion in overpayments,
of which nearly $700 million was returned to Medicare
trust funds, and detected $38 million in underpayments.5,6
RAC was implemented nationwide in 2010, allowing
audits of admissions from 2007 and beyond. Consequently,
all Medicare FFS admissions in Florida have been eligible
for RAC review since the pilot was first implemented dur-
ing 2005.
Although RAC provides enhanced oversight of medical
necessity, Medicare claims administrator (MAC) contrac-
tors, formerly known as fiscal intermediaries, have pro-
vided claims administration and review activities since the
origins of Medicare in 1965. The transition from fiscal
intermediaries to MAC contractors also began during 2005,
but was not fully implemented by 2010. In contrast to MAC
contractors, RAC enhanced existing claims review pro-
cesses, which was needed due to the multiple responsibili-
ties of MAC contractors that limited their review of claims
to a small percentage, pre-payment and post-payment. RAC
and MAC contractors use similar review processes (auto-
mated reviews and complex reviews); however, RAC
focuses exclusively on post-payment claims review. During
the RAC pilot, 85% of overpayments pertained to inpatient
admissions. In addition, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) uses other surveillance to identify cases for
referral to law enforcement. Prior to reviewing a claim,
RACs are required to assure a MAC contractor did not pre-
viously review the claim and that the review would not hin-
der a fraud investigation.7 Thus, RAC functions in
coordination with MAC contractors and avoids interfering
with fraud and abuse investigations.
RAC can adversely affect a hospital's PTOM. When a
RAC audit determines an admission was medically unnec-
essary, the provider is notified and can appeal the decision
in a process initially conducted by MAC contractors. If the
RAC decision is ultimately sustained, repayment for the
admission is required from the provider. Consequently, a
hospital incurs the expense of the admission, but will
receive no payment (revenue), thereby reducing the hospi-
tal's PTOM. During the pilot program, RAC audits in
Florida focused on short-stay claims. Hospitals with high
levels of short-stay admission denials made significant pay-
backs to Medicare. The American Hospital Association
reported that, in Florida, a significant number of 1-day
admissions were denied because they could have been man-
aged through observation or at a lower level of care, for
example, chest pain. In addition, it was reported that 3-day
stays were often denied because the admissions were pri-
marily used to qualify patients for Medicare Part A cover-
age for a skilled nursing facility.8 During the RAC pilot,
vulnerabilities identified in improper payment were com-
municated to MAC contractors for use in further develop-
ment of their strategies. Due to RAC denials, where expense
is incurred from an admission but not revenue, RAC is
expected to have a greater negative impact on PTOM than
Medicare Advantage.
Furthermore, Medicare Advantage and RAC programs
may have a greater impact on FP hospitals as the financial
pressure to admit patients is more consequential than at NFP
hospitals due to the influence of growth in admissions and
revenue on the stock price of proprietary hospital chains. For
example, 2 such chains, HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) and
Health Management Associates (HMA), both experienced
declining stock prices after reports of their first-quarter earn-
ings in 2013 revealed slower growth in hospital admissions
relative to prior periods.9 Ultimately, the HCA stock price
increased by 57% in 2013, which followed favorable ratings
for strong growth in admissions and revenue.10,11 Although
growth can be attained by acquiring more hospitals, growth
in admissions at a given hospital is more challenging to
achieve due to the surveillance of medical necessity from
Medicare Advantage plans and RAC. For example, in 2012,
some former physicians at HMA hospitals alleged they were
pressured to admit patients from the emergency department,
not always based on medical need.12 However, with increased
surveillance, unnecessary Medicare admissions are less
likely to be funded, therefore reducing hospital operating
profitability.
The importance of growth and increasing revenue to pub-
lically traded companies, including FP hospital chains, is that
stock analysts use this information to estimate earnings,
which can enhance a stock's future value. For example, a
certified financial analyst explained the benefit of growth
Langland-Orban et al 3
over several periods as follows, "it will command multiples
that exceed the market multiple."13 Furthermore, FP hospital
communications to investors state their specific goal of rev-
enue growth. In its annual report in 2013, the FP hospital
chain Community Health Systems (CHS) stated that the
company had "significant opportunities to improve financial
performance in 2014 as [they] deploy new growth strategies"
and their intent to leverage their "considerable size and scale
to drive higher revenues."14 Revenue growth is consistent
with performing in the "growth stage" of the Product Life
Cycle, as opposed to the "maturity stage," which is associ-
ated with limited potential for growth in sales, for example,
inpatient admissions. Furthermore, one strategy touted by a
private equity firm is to achieve "organic growth enhance-
ment," which is "top line" (revenue) growth, not attained via
acquisitions. The strategy is to fund continued revenue
growth without decreasing short-term earnings. The organic
growth strategy does not place cost-cutting at a premium for
demonstrating financial performance.15
Based on hospital structure, the industry is not inher-
ently highly profitable as it is real estate based and labor-
intense, meaning high fixed costs. Consequently, a
former hospital CEO explained the focus of investors as
follows: "The top line (revenue) is actually more impor-
tant than your bottom line (net income after interest,
taxes, and depreciation). You will do anything to add
revenue."16 Although NFP hospitals also seek growth,
there are no consequences for these hospitals when it is
not attained, as long as financial stability is achieved.
Instead, the consequences may affect top-management
bonuses, but there are no direct negative consequences
relative to external capital measures, such as stagnating
stock prices.
Florida provides a unique market to assess FP and NFP
hospital profitability during the implementation of
Medicare Advantage and RAC as half the acute care hospi-
tals are FP. Florida is a bellwether state with the highest
percentage of elderly population and the second highest
percentage of FP hospitals. Furthermore, from 1991 to
2005, several published studies analyzed hospital profit-
ability in Florida,1,2,17-21 such that factors associated with
profitability were established. Factors associated with hos-
pital profitability have included bed size, ownership, and
labor efficiency. Bed size is associated with economies of
scale, as average cost was found to be higher in smaller
hospitals.22 FP hospitals in Florida were associated with
fewer full-time equivalent (FTE) staff per bed, fewer per-
sonnel hours per adjusted patient day, and lower wages.1
Increases in labor efficiency were associated with sizable
gains in hospital profitability.2
Third-party payer mix also influences profitability. In
2009, Medicare and Medicaid paid hospitals 90% and 89%
of cost, respectively; in 1999, they had paid 100% and 96%
of cost, respectively. Commercial insurers paid hospitals
134% of cost in 2009, an increase from the 115% funded in
1999.23 Self-pay (uninsured) patients are associated with a
net financial loss. In 2009, the median amount spent on
uncompensated care by reporting NP hospitals was 1.52% of
hospital expenses.24 Consequently, commercial insurance is
expected to be the most profitable and self-pay the least
profitable.
The present study analyzed 11 years of data from 2000
through 2010 to assess whether Medicare Advantage or RAC
was associated with changes in hospital PTOMs of FP and
NFP hospitals during this time period.
Methods
Hospital financial data from the Florida Agency for Health
Care Administration were used to analyze the operating prof-
itability of community acute care hospitals in Florida from
2000 through 2010. Hospitals excluded from the analysis
were the major teaching hospitals, public hospitals, taxing
district hospitals, and those owned by foundations, as they
have additional revenue sources, which may or may not
accrue as operating revenue. In addition, hospitals with less
than 50 beds were excluded as they are more likely to experi-
ence diseconomies of scale and many are critical access hos-
pitals, making them dissimilar to the retained group. A total
of 104 acute care hospitals remained for inclusion: 42 NFP
and 62 FP hospitals.
PTOM was the dependent variable. It quantifies profit-
ability from annual patient care operations, measuring a hos-
pital's ability to generate revenue while controlling expense.
It was calculated as follows:
PTOM
Total operating revenue
Total operating expense
=
-







Total operating revenue
.
Independent variables used in the analysis were organized
into three categories. The RAC variable captures time, pre-
implementation and post-implementation of RAC. As the
RAC pilot was implemented during 2005, fiscal year 2006
was the first year that would definitely be affected. The orga-
nizational variables capture both ownership type and decisions
the organization can make, for example, Bed Size and Labor
Efficiency. Adjusted patient days (APD) was used in calculat-
ing the Labor Efficiency variable. It was defined as follows,
and accounts for both inpatient and outpatient services:

Gross Outpatient Revenue

.
The payer type variables capture the payer mix for each hos-
pital. All variables were continuous, except for RAC and
Ownership. Each variable is defined below.
4 INQUIRY
A mixed-effects model was used to capture the effect over
time (11 years) of the repeated measurements for each hospi-
tal, containing both fixed and random effects, to estimate the
association between PTOM and the independent variables
described above. The study's unit of observation was an indi-
vidual hospital. Ownership was modeled as a binary vari-
able, and a hospital-specific random effect was included in
the model to account for correlation of PTOM for the same
hospital. The Commercial insurance variable was excluded
from the model and all other payer type variables were
included. Seven interaction terms with Ownership type were
added to the model. All statistical analyses were performed
with Statistical Analysis System software (Version 9.4; SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

Results
Table 1 provides the time trends for all performance indica-
tor variables used in the model, as well as the percentage of
patient days by payer type, for 2000 and 2010. The 11-year
time trend statistical significance (P
trend
) is based on data
from 2000 through 2010. During the 11-year period, the
average Bed Size increased by 16.8% (P < .0001), which was
similar to Florida's population increase. TheAdjusted patient
days variable did not significantly change. Patient care FTE
and Non-patient care FTE increased, by 28.8% (P < .0001)
and 10.3% (P = .0004), respectively. Labor Efficiency
decreased by 11.2% (P = .0124), consistent with Adjusted
patient days not changing whereas Patient care FTE and
Non-patient care FTE increased. PTOM did not significantly
change over the 11-year period.
Medicare FFS and Medicare Advantage together
accounted for about 60% of patient days. From 2000 through
2010, the percentage of Medicare FFS patient days decreased
by 4 percentage points (P = .0033), whereas Medicare
Advantage increased by 3 percentage points (P = .029).
Medicare FFS and Commercial insurance were the first and
second most frequent payer types, respectively. Commercial
insurance was 17.35% of patient days in 2010, which was a
2­percentage point decrease over the study period (P = .020).
Medicaid increased by 4 percentage points (P < .0001), aver-
aging 14.5% in 2010. Self-pay increased from 4.1% to 5.5%
(P < .0001) during this period. Other Payers decreased from
5.4% to 3.2% (P < .0001).
Figure 1 illustrates changes in average PTOM at FP and
NFP hospitals over the study period. In 2000, average PTOM
was -2.3% for NFPs and 7.6% at FPs, which is nearly a
10­percentage point difference. By 2010, the difference
decreased to 1.4 percentage points with average PTOM of
4.1% at NFPs and 5.5% at FPs. Although the FP hospitals
started the period with a higher average PTOM, the PTOM
of the two groups converged during the 11-year period.
Average PTOM for FPs reached a nadir in fiscal year 2006,
which is the year following the implementation of the RAC
pilot program; however, this average has since monotoni-
cally improved.
The results of the final model are provided in Table 2. The
chi-square statistic was 139.0, with 16 degrees of freedom.
The resulting P value was less than .0001, which indicates
that the full model was a good fit over the null model, using
the likelihood ratio test.

Based on the size of coefficient estimates, both the Intercept
and Ownership (NFP) have the largest magnitude coefficients
at 24.96 and -18.18, respectively, and both were statistically
significant. All the other variables have values less than the
absolute value of 1, other than RAC (-4.68). The FP hospitals
start this study period at a much higher and positive PTOM
position than the NFPs, as evidenced in the intercept and the
effect of NFP ownership status. The intercept results are an
artifact of the model, so the values are not the true PTOM
group mean at the start of the study period because all relevant
variables were not considered. FPs, on average, had a higher
and positive PTOM at the start of the study period, whereas
the NFP group had, on average, a negative PTOM at the start,
consistent with Figure 1. Based on the estimate for RAC, FP
hospitals, on average, lost 4.68 percentage points of PTOM
following RAC; conversely, NFP hospitals achieved an aver-
age increase in PTOM of 0.08 percentage points as the RAC ×
Ownership interaction estimate was 4.76.
For payer type variables, the main effects for Medicare
FFS and Medicaid were statistically significant, and main
and interaction effects for Other Payers were also significant.
The Medicare Advantage was not statistically significant for
either ownership type. PTOM had the same association with
payer types regardless of hospital ownership type, with the
exception of Other Payers, which is a relatively small group
of unidentified payers.
Larger bed size was positively associated with PTOM.
However, Labor Efficiency, both main effects and interaction
effects, was not statistically significant. This may suggest,
overall, that hospitals have optimized labor efficiency, espe-
cially as the reimbursement environment is such that greater
volume (adjusted patient days) does not always result in
greater payment.
Discussion
The present study analyzed the association of two Medicare
policy changes (Medicare Advantage and RAC) on hospital
PTOM. Medicare Advantage was not associated with PTOM
at FP or NFP hospitals, using Commercial insurance as the
reference group. The lack of statistical significance may
occur as Medicare Advantage plans use similar provisions in
approving admissions as Commercial insurance plans, which
was the reference group.
In contrast, the RAC variable was associated with a signifi-
cant decrease in PTOM at FP hospitals, but not at NFP hospi-
tals. The analysis does not allow for making conclusions about
the potential association of RAC and decreased PTOM at FP
hospitals. For example, PTOM may decrease due to RAC pay-
ment denials for purported medically unnecessary admissions
or, alternatively, from FP hospitals decreasing potentially
unnecessary admissions to avoid risk of payment denial.
As evidenced in Figure 1, the average PTOM at FP hospi-
tals decreased in 2004, which is prior to the implementation
of the RAC pilot program. This may be attributed to other
federal surveillance initiatives regarding medical necessity,
fraud, and abuse, which were not controlled for in the study
because they existed throughout the study period. The four
largest FP hospital chain settlements during the study period
with Medicare over fraud and abuse are listed below with
three occurring prior to RAC.

·
· 2003: $631 million by HCA
·
· 2004: $325 million by HealthSouth
·
· 2006: $900 million by Tenet Healthcare.
It is possible that such settlements resulted in changing prac-
tices among FP chains to avoid further penalties, which may

have also affected PTOMs and were not controlled for in the
present study. The FP hospital industry's perspective on
increasing surveillance was explained as follows: "Nearly all
publicly traded systems list the government's heightened and
more well-coordinated, focus on policing healthcare fraud
and abuse as a risk factor for their business."25
Since 2006, the average PTOM at FP hospitals in Florida
has improved. This may occur as information about RAC pro-
cesses and the basis for payment denials became evident,
thereby allowing hospitals to be more effective in appealing
denials and determining, in advance, the types of cases that
will be denied. Numerous publications advise providers on
considerations in appealing RAC decisions as five levels of
appeal exist, developing an internal RAC-response approach,
improving clinical documentation and coding systems, as
well as understanding reasons targeted by RACs for payment
denial, for example, cases involving inpatient rehabilitation
admissions, high-risk diagnosis-related groups, and use of
certain diagnosis and procedure codes.26-31 One goal of the
U.S. Senate Finance Committee is to assure that the RAC
process is efficient, recognizing providers report that it can be
overburdonsome.32 The ultimate goal is to minimize RAC
denials as hospitals avoid medically unnecessary admissions,
coding problems, and other discrepancies targeted by RAC.
Although FP Florida community hospitals began the 21st
century with higher average PTOMs, the margins converged
with NFP Florida hospitals around the time RAC was imple-
mented and have remained similar since. Although RAC was
one Medicare initiative that appears to have contributed to
this change, other CMS surveillance initiatives were also
used. RAC coordinates with MAC contractors and fraud and
abuse investigations, such that RAC is complementary to
