Objectives. This study examines the individual, spousal, and household characteristics associated with the retirement
expectations of husbands and wives.
Methods. Using data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study, subjective probabilities of working full-time after
reaching age 62 and age 65 are used to measure retirement expectations. The retirement expectations of husbands and
wives are modeled simultaneously using a joint-generalized least-squares approach.
Results. Within a marriage, retirement expectations are shaped by individual, spousal, and household characteristics.
We observe some gender differences in cross-spousal influence with wives' retirement expectations being more influ-
enced by husbands' resources and constraints than vice versa. Nonetheless, individual and household factors associated
with retirement expectations are widely shared by husbands and wives.
Discussion. Husbands and wives both respond to individual and joint constraints and opportunities when planning
for retirement. Findings support that there is considerable overlap in retirement planning of husbands and wives during
early parts of the retirement decision-making process. However, inequity in cross-spousal influences is a defining char-
acteristic of retirement decision making. Implications for both policy makers and practitioners are briefly discussed.
ETIREMENT is a policy issue that will pervade public
debate for many years to come as the retirement of the
Baby Boom cohort threatens the security of the Social Secu-
rity trust fund. Traditional policy solutions to preserve fiscal
solvency are most often in the form of financial penalties for
early labor force withdrawal. These penalties have long
been part of the Social Security pension system (Quinn &
Burkhauser, 1994), and they are likely to play a central role
in ensuring solvency in the next several decades. Future co-
horts of older workers will soon face ever greater age eligibil-
ity criteria for full pension benefits as eligibility for full So-
cial Security benefits gradually increases to age 67 between
2003 and 2007. Additional policy changes are likely to occur,
and issues such as privatizing Social Security and reducing
benefits now occupy center stage in national policy debates.
Projecting the fiscal implications of policies such as these
is typically based on research in which retirement behavior
is construed as an individual's decision. As Baby Boomers
approach the prime retirement ages, however, the retirement
decision is increasingly likely to be a family decision--a de-
cision based on two earnings histories, two sources of pen-
sion wealth, and two persons' health considerations. The
coupling of retirement decisions within a marriage is rein-
forced by Social Security's structuring of husbands' and
wives' benefits around the earnings history of both persons.
In this study, we gain new insights into married couples' re-
tirement decisions by examining how retirement expecta-
tions are shaped not only by one's own characteristics, but
also by those of their spouse, and household characteristics
held in common. We also assess how factors influencing re-
tirement expectations differ for husbands and wives, offer-
ing new insights into the gendering of retirement decisions
within families. Our results contribute to an emerging line of
inquiry that is mindful of the pairing of retirement through
marriage (Blau, 1998; Gustman & Steinmeier, 1994; Hen-
retta & O'Rand, 1983; Henretta, O'Rand, & Chan, 1993;
Hurd, 1990; O'Rand, Henretta, & Krecker, 1992; Pozzen-
bon & Mitchell, 1989; Smith & Moen, 1998; Szinovacz,
Ekerdt, & Vinick, 1994).
Retirement Plans of Couples
Our analysis of retirement expectations allows us to focus
on the early part of the retirement process when individuals
are formulating expectations about eventual behavior. This
is important, we believe, because this is a point in the life
course when policy initiatives may have the greatest conse-
quences, and when changes in retirement expectations may
foretell future changes in retirement behavior. Nonetheless,
much of the value of our approach rests on the idea that re-
tirement expectations are reasonable predictors of retire-
ment behavior. Fortunately, the evidence for accurate fore-
casting is relatively consistent and comes from an array of
studies (see Honig, 1996a, for a review). Where expecta-
tions and behavior do not coincide, unanticipated events,
such as changes in pension wealth and health, frequently
prompt retirement earlier than originally planned (Ander-
son, Burkhauser, & Quinn, 1986), making adaptation to re-
tirement more difficult (Szinovacz, 1989).
A related issue is the extent to which factors influencing
retirement expectations parallel those associated with retire-
ment behavior. Although the body of empirical work is not
dense, available evidence suggests overall congruence in the
structure of factors influencing expectations and behavior
(Honig, 1996a). Like retirement behavior, individuals ex-
R
S200 PIENTA AND HAYWARD
pect to retire sooner when their nonmarket time is more
valuable, health insurance continues after retirement, pen-
sion wealth is high, health problems are present, their
spouse is retired, and their job tasks are mundane and repet-
itive (Ekerdt, DeViney, & Kosloski, 1996; Honig, 1996b;
Hall & Johnson, 1980; Shaw, 1984). Gender differences in
the characteristics associated with retirement expectations
also align with studies of gender differences in retirement
behavior. Like men, women expect to retire sooner if their
health insurance continues after retirement, a private pen-
sion is available, and pension wealth is sizeable. Somewhat
less clear are the effects of health status and job conditions
for women's retirement, but it appears that the effects gener-
ally parallel those for men (Honig, 1996b). Although there is
considerable evidence about the retirement expectations of in-
dividual workers, very few studies have focused explicitly on
retirement expectations as part of a family retirement process.
We take advantage of traditional theoretical frameworks
of retirement behavior to lay the foundation for our model
of retirement expectations within marriage. For example,
we expect that, among dual-earner couples, husbands and
wives formulate retirement expectations in response to their
work environment where they gather information and accu-
mulate resources. Based on available information and re-
sources, workers forecast their future work and nonwork in-
come, pension entitlements, and the quality of life should
they retire. This model would fit actual planning behavior
were it not for the fact the most workers return home after
work and plan for retirement with their spouse. Marriage
provides a context in which the lives, decisions, and choices
of married partners are intertwined (Henretta et al., 1993;
Riley & Riley, 1993). Retirement decisions become joined by
virtue of the balance of family and work role negotiations that
originate from economic and social needs over the family
life course. An important consequence of the intersection of
work and family forces is that retirement expectations may
be "gendered" within marriage--a point we consider next.
The Gendering of Retirement Expectations
Within Marriage
Henretta and colleagues (1993) make a fundamental point
that guides our analysis of retirement expectations within
marriage. Drawing on the work of Treas (1991) and En-
gland and Farkas (1986) and others, Henretta and his col-
leagues emphasize differentiated work and family pathways
as key factors in understanding the retirement behavior of
couples. Building on this literature, we argue that a funda-
mental part of men's identity is that of family provider (Grad-
man, 1994), with success benchmarked to the work career
(Gradman, 1994). Furthermore, we expect that the salience
of the work role to men's identity increases with job status
(Gradman, 1994). Under these circumstances, we expect
that men's retirement decisions are closely tied to indicators
of success within the work career and the economic de-
mands of their families. Prior research supports this argu-
ment, showing, for example, that men delay retirement
when working in jobs offering significant intrinsic rewards
or when faced with low levels of retirement income and de-
pendent children (Anderson, Clark, & Johnson, 1982; Hay-
ward, Friedman, & Chen, 1998; Henretta & O'Rand, 1983).
Many women retiring in recent years have balanced both
work and family demands over much of their adult lives.
Substantial numbers of retirement-aged women have inter-
rupted careers because of childrearing demands (O'Rand et
al., 1992) and the caring of older family members (Hatch &
Thompson, 1992). For these women, interruption of the
work career because of family demands suggests that work
attachment is a less salient aspect of these women's lives
compared with women who are life-long members of the
labor force. Observed retirement patterns of women are
consistent with this interpretation--women with uninter-
rupted careers during the childbearing years are more likely
to delay retirement compared with women with interrupted
careers in the childbearing years (O'Rand et al., 1992; Pienta,
Burr, & Mutchler, 1994). There is less evidence of the effects
of working conditions on women's retirement behavior.
Reinforcing the effects of differential family roles is the
gender inequity in resources derived from the work career.
Men's resources generally are greater than women's, sug-
gesting that husbands' plans and resources are more influen-
tial for women's plans than vice versa. Research findings,
however, are ambiguous on this point. Studies based on data
from the 1970s suggest the husband's expectations and re-
sources are the dominant force in couples' retirement deci-
sion making (Anderson et al., 1982; Shaw, 1984). More re-
cent studies (Gustman & Steinmeier, 1994; Honig, 1996b)
point to a shift toward greater equity such that both partners
in a marriage have a strong predisposition toward joint re-
tirement. This is reflected in the fact that the work status of
the husband (or wife) is strongly associated with delayed re-
tirement of a spouse.
Our study brings these issues into empirical focus by
modeling retirement expectations as a function of individ-
ual, spousal, and household characteristics that arise from
the work career and family life course. What influences do
the individual and shared life-course experiences and re-
sources of husbands and wives have on both their own and
their spouse's retirement expectations? We are also able to
examine the additional implications of household retirement
planning behavior. As partners look toward retirement, we
anticipate that those who have discussed retirement plans
with their spouse have more crystallized expectations.
More than likely, such planful behavior is indicative of a
more general pattern of negotiation that evolves through
the balancing of work and family demands over the course
of a marriage.
METHODS
The 1992 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is an ex-
cellent resource for examining the retirement expectations
of husbands and wives in the years preceding retirement
(Juster & Suzman, 1995). The target population of the HRS
is persons aged 51­61 years and their spouses or partners;
spouses or partners are potentially younger or older than
age-eligible respondents. Comparable information is avail-
able for both husbands and wives on a variety of topics, in-
cluding demographic characteristics, health and disability,
current/past job characteristics, retirement plans and expec-
tations, net worth, income, and health insurance.
In this study, we restrict the analytic sample to age-eligible
MARRIAGE AND RETIREMENT PLANNING S201
respondents who are married or cohabiting and both part-
ners are in the work force (Chevan, 1996). This makes it
possible to examine the prospective retirement plans of dual-
earner partners and thus cross-spousal influences of work
characteristics. Regardless of whether a couple is married
or cohabiting, the term spouse is used to denote a partner.
We exclude couples if either spouse is younger than age 45
(n  276), because it is less likely that younger respon-
dents have reasonable expectations about retirement tim-
ing and will be more prone to give information based on
normative retirement ages. About 8% of couples contain
missing data on the dependent variable for one of the
spouses (n  158 couples). The resulting analytic sample
includes 1,818 married and cohabiting couples for which
we have complete data.
Retirement Expectations
We measure retirement expectations based on the follow-
ing question: "Thinking about work generally and not just
your present job, what do you think are the chances that you
will be working full time after you reach age 62?" The re-
sponse set is a scale ranging from 0 to 10, in which 0 equals
"absolutely no chance" and 10 equals "absolutely certain."
We transform these values into subjective probabilities by
dividing each value by 10, thus a respondent's probability
ranges from 0 to 1 (see Honig, 1996b, for an example of this
strategy). A value of one can be interpreted as having a high
expectation of continued work after reaching age 62, condi-
tional on working currently. Values closer to zero represent
stronger expectations of early retirement. We also construct
a measure of delayed retirement expectations, i.e., expecta-
tions of working full time past age 65, conditional on work-
ing currently and having some expectation of working past
age 62.
Not surprisingly, retirement expectations are not nor-
mally distributed--the probabilities cluster at the extremes
of the distribution. We thus transform the subjective proba-
bilities into a cumulative logistic function (Pindyck & Ru-
binfeld, 1976). Using the subjective probability of working
full time after age 62 for illustration, the transformation is
ln(P62
/1  P62
). The slope of the cumulative logistic distri-
bution is greatest at P62
 1/2, which implies that changes in
independent variables will have their greatest impact on the
probability of tending to be more neutral in plans for retire-
ment. The low slopes near the endpoints of the distribution
require larger changes in independent variables to bring
about a small change in probability. This transformation al-
lows us to use joint generalized least-squares (GLS) estima-
tion, which is described below.
Work Conditions and Resources
The HRS contains an array of work-related measures that
define the structural imperatives of work (i.e., factors defin-
ing the day-to-day qualities of work activity) that influence
retirement behavior (Hayward et al., 1998; Hayward, Grady,
Hardy, & Sommers, 1989; Hurd & McGarry, 1993; Spen-
ner, 1988). Two measures of job demands (physical and
cognitive) are derived from a factor analysis of eight items
assessing current job requirements. Using the Promax rota-
tion method, an exploratory factor analysis supports a two-
factor structure (eigenvalues: 2.45 and 1.98): physical de-
mands and cognitive demands. Jobs that are physically
demanding involve physical effort, lifting heavy loads, and
bending over. Jobs that are cognitively demanding involve
good eyesight, intense concentration (or attention), analyz-
ing data (or information), keeping a pace set by others, and
learning new things. Physical demands factor loadings
range from .85 (job requires stooping or bending) to .87
( job requires lifting heavy objects) explaining 21.6% of the
variance (21.4% variance is explained when the other factor
is eliminated). Cognitive demands factor loadings range
from .57 (job requires good eyesight) to .72 ( job requires
concentration) explaining 18.6% of the variance (18.5%
variance is explained when the other factor is eliminated).
The interfactor correlation is .076. Average scores for
each set of items are calculated with Cronbach's alphas of
.84 and .64 for physical and cognitive demands, respec-
tively. Higher scores reflect greater job demands.
The retirement-related extrinsic rewards of work are mea-
sured in terms of pension eligibility status (no coverage
available; has pension coverage, but not yet eligible; and
currently receiving or eligible to receive benefits), private
pension wealth, and health insurance coverage. Pension
wealth is its present value at time of the 1992 interview.
Pension wealth is a constructed measure obtained from the
HRS web site (see www.umich.edu/~hrswww/center/rescont2.
html for a complete description of this measure). The
measure is based on self-report information and poten-
tially reflects the promise or receipt of employer-provided
pension benefits from up to three current or prior jobs.
Health insurance references whether the respondent is un-
insured, has employer-provided insurance either through
one's own employer or spouse's employer, or has health
insurance from a nonemployer source (including privately
purchased and government-provided health insurance,
such as Medicaid).
Self-employment establishes whether retirement plans
are tied to one's position in a bureaucratic organization
(Ekerdt, Hackney, Kosloski, & DeViney, 2001; Hayward et
al., 1998). This is important because self-employed workers
encounter less social regulation of work careers (Ekerdt et
al., 2001). Also, self-employed men and women may work
longer because self-employed workers earn less than their
non­self-employed counterparts (Hamilton, 2000). Self-
employment is attractive to many workers because it in-
cludes many nonpecuniary benefits, such as greater auton-
omy, flexibility, intrinsic job satisfaction, and self-expression
(Carr, 1996; Hamilton, 2000). For all of these reasons, self-
employment is expected to increase expectations for de-
layed retirement. This is consistent with a recent study
showing that self-employed workers have greater uncer-
tainty about retirement timing (Ekerdt et al., 2001). We also
control for part-time work (less than 35 hours/week) be-
cause part-time workers are likely to have lower labor mar-
ket attachment than full-time workers.
Health Characteristics
All else being equal, health is a primary motive for retire-
ment with those in the poorest health either retiring or be-
coming work disabled. In part, workers in poor health may
S202 PIENTA AND HAYWARD
attach higher value to retirement than work. A related issue
is that health problems may make it more difficult to keep
up with the daily demands of work. Most retirement re-
search examining the effects of health relies on a work limi-
tations measure (i.e., Does the respondent report a health
condition that limits the amount or type of work they can
do?) Like prior studies, we make use of the health measure
evaluating the presence of a health condition that limits
work ability (1  limited in the amount or kind of work;
0  otherwise).
We expand the measurement of health to include serious
chronic disease conditions that affect not only functional
status, but also a person's motivation to work (Verbrugge &
Jette, 1994; Wolinsky, Armbrecht, & Wyrwich, 2000). We
have chosen to focus on serious chronic health conditions
(Ferraro & Farmer, 1999) for the following reasons. First,
serious chronic illnesses may either increase the value of
leisure relative to work and contribute to early retirement
expectations or shorten one's time horizon for achieving
one's goals. Conversely, delayed retirement expectations
may result when a person attempts to manage a serious
chronic illness, thereby increasing the need for health care
insurance or income. Serious chronic conditions are mea-
sured using self-report of whether a doctor has ever told the
respondent that he/she has hypertension, coronary heart
disease, stroke, cancer (nonskin), diabetes, or chronic lung
disease. For simplicity, we create a measure in which each
condition is given equal weight (1  condition present, 0 
not present) and summed together to form a single measure.
Household Planning Behavior
The HRS includes a measure of prior retirement planning
activities of couples. Respondents are asked how frequently
they have discussed retirement plans with their spouse. The
range of responses is "hardly at all" (scored as 1) to "a lot"
(scored as 4). Missing information is randomly assigned a
value based on the variable's distribution. Although we an-
ticipate that household planning behavior influences retire-
ment expectations, it is also possible that an individual's re-
tirement expectations also affect household planning. Thus,
we caution against interpreting the association between re-
tirement planning behavior and retirement expectations in
strong causal terms, and we think it likely reflects the fact
that the effect is overestimated.
Household Family Characteristics
Family characteristics define the immediate and past
constraints and opportunity costs of both partners. Couples
"share" childrearing responsibilities, for example, although
there may be a division of tasks for husbands and wives. A
particularly salient issue, from a retirement planning per-
spective, is the presence of dependent children in the house-
hold. Couples who have chosen either to delay childbearing
or to postpone the end of their childbearing activities are
likely to enter their retirement years with children living at
home (or temporarily away at school).
We also examine the effects of the overall level of income
and wealth within the household. The household income of
dual-earner couples reflects both the resources immediately
available, as well as the opportunity costs associated with
early retirement. Net worth is a measure of assets less the
debts of a household.
Demographic Characteristics
We construct measures for various sociodemographic
factors that differentiate retirement experiences in the popu-
lation. These measures include age, education (years of
completed schooling), and race/ethnicity (White, African
American, Hispanic, and other non-Whites [including Asian,
Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Alaskan native]). Afri-
can American men typically exit the labor force at higher
rates than White men (Burr, Massagli, Mutchler, & Pienta,
1996; Hayward, Friedman, & Chen, 1996), whereas African
American women work longer than White women (Pienta et
al., 1994). Hispanic men have lower rates of labor force ex-
iting than African American and White men. Hispanic
women have higher rates of exiting than other women (Flip-
pen & Tienda, 2000).
Spouse Characteristics
The joint nature of husbands' and wives' retirement is
also captured by assessing the effects of the spouse's expec-
tations on the respondent's own expectations, and the effects
of several other relevant spousal attributes. Because the
spouse's expectation is potentially endogenous in our model
(i.e., the individual's and spouse's expectations are simulta-
neously determined), we used an instrumental variables
approach to reduce the endogeneity problem. Our basic ap-
proach was one in which we attempted to select as many
predictors strongly associated with the spouse's expecta-
tions, but not strongly associated with the individual's ex-
pectations, as possible (Heckman, 1997). In this analysis,
we regressed the spouse's expectations on their age, educa-
tion, self-reported health, pension wealth, expectations of
living to ages 75­92, and reasoning ability (results available
from the authors), separately for expectations of early and
delayed retirement. Based on the estimated parameters, we
calculated a predicted score for the spouse's expectations
and included this as our measure of spouse's expectations in
the modeling of a person's retirement expectations.
Other key spouse characteristics include age, health, and
pension wealth. Spouse's age, net of one's own age, cap-
tures the tendency to conform to a spouse's age-related re-
tirement schedule. When a spouse is older, we expect this to
increase the probability that a person will expect to retire
early. The effect of spousal health is ambiguous. A spouse in
poor health may increase the attractiveness of joint "lei-
sure," or it may have the opposite effect of requiring a
worker to remain in the labor force to meet the financial
needs of the couple. Finally, we consider whether access
to a spouse's pension benefits increases early retirement
expectations.
Analytic Model
In estimating a retirement expectations model, we adopt
an analytic approach that allows us to gauge cross-spousal
influences allowing for the correlation of husbands' and
wives' unmeasured retirement preferences (Gustman &
Steinmeier, 1994). Another aspect of this problem is that
spouses may have retirement preferences that are unmea-
MARRIAGE AND RETIREMENT PLANNING S203
sured in our model, but that are highly correlated. Gustman
and Steinmeier (1994) give an example of correlated retire-
ment preferences arising from assortative mating (e.g., men
and women with similar preferences for early retirement
may marry).
Because it is not possible to include all theoretically rele-
vant information about husbands' and wives' retirement
preferences, our modeling approach adjusts the error struc-
ture of both spouses by taking into account a correlated er-
ror structure in the husbands' and wives' expectations
models. We do this by estimating husbands' and wives' re-
tirement expectations with a joint GLS model--also referred
to as a "seemingly unrelated regression" (SURE) model
(Zellner, 1962). An example of an application of the SURE
model is a study by Simpson and Wilson (1987), who at-
tempted to capture the correlation between spouses' plans
within dual-earner couples from unobserved heterogeneity.
The joint GLS model takes the following form based on
the conceptualization of retirement expectations:
Ph
represents the husband's subjective probability of work-
ing full time after age 62 (or age 65), and Pw
is the wife's
subjective probability. Recall that Ph
and Pw
are transformed
using a cumulative logistic distribution function so that or-
dinary least squares (OLS) can be used for estimation. Each
spouse's expectation is presumed to be a function of a vec-
tor of "i" work characteristics, "j" health characteristics, "k"
family characteristics, and so on. Note that the model in-
cludes a vector of "m" spouse characteristics described
previously.
The method allows the disturbances (h
and w
) to be cor-
related across the two equations, because there is reason to
suspect that this is the case. The estimator for this set of
equations is obtained in two steps. In the first step, a cross-
equation covariance matrix is computed from residuals from
the two separate equations estimated with OLS. This matrix
is then used to weight the final estimates' retirement expec-
tations. The SURE model is estimated using PROC MODEL
in SAS. The SAS procedure produces a system-weighted R2
computed using the cross-equation correlation matrix.
In the analysis that follows, nested models are estimated
in which the base model includes only individual character-
istics. A second model introduces spousal and couple-level
characteristics (spouses' plans, spouses' characteristics, and
household constraints/resources). The nested models allow
us to assess how the effects of person-specific retirement
predictors are altered when taking into account spousal re-
sources and expectations. The full model is the basis on
which we evaluate the direct effects of spousal and house-
hold influences on a partner's expectations. Because we es-
timate models for both husbands and wives, we are able to

compare whether factors influencing retirement expecta-
tions are dependent on gender. We use an F test in the two
nested models of husbands and wives to formally test for the
equivalence of effects. Values in the tables are underlined to
indicate statistically different predictors of husbands' and
wives' plans (significant at the .05 level and adjusted for
shared covariance across the models), providing insights
into the gendering of retirement expectations among mar-
ried couples.
Two sets of nested models are estimated: one for early re-
tirement (i.e., the subjective probability of working full time
after age 62) and the other for delayed retirement (the sub-
jective probability of working full time past age 65). The
analysis of delayed retirement expectations is based on a
subset of the sample who had at least some expectation of
working past age 62. In other words, we analyze couples
that attach some probability to working past age 62 (Ph
and
Pw
are both greater than zero). For couples thinking about
working past age 62, the probability of working past age 65
is regressed on comparable independent variables. Again,
positive coefficients indicate stronger plans for delaying re-
tirement past age 65. Finally, the system-weighted R2 (joint
GLS) is compared with the adjusted R2 (OLS) to evaluate
whether we improve upon the individual estimation of re-
tirement expectations.
Selection
Because couples are excluded when at least one spouse
has already left the labor force, we estimated a selection
model to evaluate whether the selection of dual-earner cou-
ples biases our results. For example, it is possible that more
traditional couples or couples that are more age heteroga-
mous are excluded in our models. Because the potential ex-
ists for introducing selectivity into our analysis, we esti-
mated a two-stage selection model (Berk, 1983; Heckman,
1979). In the first stage, a number of independent variables
were chosen that were related to sample inclusion, but not
the dependent variable (retirement expectations). The full
set of predictor variables included the following: both part-
ners' ages and education, the race/ethnicity of the household
head, number of offspring, number of children living in the
household or at school, and equality in decision making.
The results showed that excluded couples differ from those
in our analysis mainly in that the husband tends to be older,
the wife tends to be younger, the wife tends to be less edu-
cated, the couple has a larger number of children, and the
couple does not engage in egalitarian decision making. The
second-stage model (see results in Tables 2 and 3) included
a selection correction term calculated from the parameter
estimates of the first model. Although our results remain the
same whether we correct for selection or not, we present
the results correcting for sample selection.
RESULTS
Included in Table 1 are descriptive characteristics for
HRS husbands and wives. Although cohabiters tend to be
younger and have less education than those who are married
(results not shown), retirement expectations do not differ
between cohabiting and married persons. As such, we do
not distinguish between married and cohabiting persons. We
S204 PIENTA AND HAYWARD
also generated a parallel set of results that excluded cohabit-
ers, but these did not differ substantially from the results
presented later.
As one might expect, wives are younger than husbands,
but do not differ in educational attainment. Wives are gener-
ally in better health than husbands--wives report fewer fatal
chronic conditions and less work disability. Life cycle work
experiences of husbands and wives are uniformly different.
Husbands tend to work in jobs that are more physically de-
manding and less cognitively demanding than wives'jobs; hus-
bands also tend to be self-employed. Wives tend to work part
time. Pension characteristics differ with men having greater
pension wealth and access to employer-provided pensions.
Husbands attach a much higher probability to working
full time after age 62 than do wives (Ph
 .51 compared
with Pw
 .36). Husbands are also more likely to expect to
continue working full time after age 65 than are wives (Ph

.38, whereas Pw
 .29). Both findings reinforce the idea that
women maintain a somewhat weaker attachment to the
labor force--in part this may be because wives in these birth
cohorts have had substantially less work experience through-
out their lives. These findings also demonstrate the enor-
mous popularity of early retirement given that neither hus-
bands or wives report strong probabilities of working full
time after age 62 or age 65. Husbands' and wives' expecta-
tions about the timing of retirement are interrelated, with
correlation coefficients of .28 and .23 (expectations about
retirement upon reaching ages 62 and 65, respectively) that
are statistically significant (results not shown).
Early Retirement Expectations
Early retirement expectations of husbands and wives are
explored in greater detail in Table 2 to determine similarities
and differences in the factors associated with husbands' and
wives' early retirement expectations. The results for Models
1 and 2 show that, although there is considerable similarity
across spouses, age and health influence the early retirement
plans of husbands and wives differently. Age has a much
smaller impact on wives' early retirement expectations than
it does on husbands' expectations (.053 and .259, respec-
tively, in Model 2). Both husbands and wives who are older
are more likely to expect to work full time after reaching
age 62, but this effect is statistically significant for men and
not women. The overall age pattern may reflect a combina-
tion of factors, such as age selectivity (i.e., who is still in the
labor force when queried about expectations), more accu-
rate forecasts among older workers, and potential cohort
differences.
We expected chronic health conditions and work disabil-
ity to be positively associated with the early retirement ex-
pectations of both husbands and wives based on the idea
that declining health signals a shorter work career. Our re-
sults for husbands are consistent with this expectation. Hus-
bands who have been diagnosed with a serious chronic con-
dition have weaker expectations of working past age 62.
Wives in poorer health, however measured, do not differ
significantly from wives in good health in their retirement
expectations. Health is surprisingly not associated with
wives' expectations.
Attributes of work have equivalent effects on husbands'
and wives' early retirement expectations. Our results show
that men and women expect to work longer in jobs with
greater cognitive demands and jobs in which workers are
self-employed. Greater pension wealth is negatively associ-
ated with husbands' and wives' expectations of working full
time after age 62. As shown in Model 1, the absence of
health insurance increases the probability of husbands' and
wives' early retirement, although this effect is reduced
and no longer significant once the spouse's characteristics
are included as control variables.
Spouse and household characteristics provide additional
insight into the retirement plans of couples (Model 2, Table
2). Husbands' work disabilities, pension eligibility, and pen-
sion wealth all decrease wives' expectations of working
after age 62 (see Model 2, Table 2). Husbands' retirement
expectations, however, are not influenced by wives' health
and pension characteristics. Although the pattern of these
spousal effects suggests that husbands play a more signifi-
cant role in women's retirement decisions than vice versa,
we note that the differences are not statistically significant.
Discussing retirement plans with a spouse is associated with
lower expectations of working full time after age 62 for both
husbands and wives, but particularly so for husbands. Al-
though potential endogeneity problems make it difficult to
make strong inferences about this association, it strongly

MARRIAGE AND RETIREMENT PLANNING S205
suggests that retirement decisions are the outcome of house-
hold planning involving both the husband and the wife.
Both husbands and wives living in wealthier households
are less likely to plan to continue working after age 62
(Model 2, Table 2). Financial constraints, particularly those
defined by household wealth, clearly limit choices about the
timing of retirement. Household wealth allows both partners
in a marriage greater freedom to choose leisure over work.
Another economic challenge faced by many retirement-age
couples is providing for dependent children in the house-
hold. Our results suggest that husbands, but not wives, plan
to postpone retirement when dependent children live in the
home--a possible product of men's greater earnings.
Delayed Retirement Expectations
The availability of full Social Security benefits at age 65
raises the possibility that the mix of factors influencing de-
layed retirement differs from that influencing retirement ex-
pectations under conditions of reduced benefits. To evaluate
this question, we modeled expectations of working full time
after age 65 among persons who, at a minimum, are uncer-
tain about early retirement. In other words, this model in-
cludes couples where both partners report the probability of
working full time after age 62 is greater than zero.
Similar to our results for early retirement, the age gradi-
ent is steeper for men, and health has little effect on
women's expectations. More years of education increase ex-
pectations of delayed retirement for both husbands and
wives (see Model 1, Table 3), although the education effect
is attenuated for wives once spouse characteristics are con-
trolled for.
Work characteristics are related to delayed retirement
expectations. Cognitive job demands significantly increase
the delayed retirement expectations, although no such ef-

fects are observed for wives. The effect of cognitive de-
mands for men is consistent with prior research document-
ing lower rates of retirement among male workers in these
positions (Hayward et al., 1998). Physical job demands, on
the other hand, are positively associated with expectations
of wives' working full time after age 65. The positive ef-
fect of physical job demands on women's expectations is
contrary to what one would expect under the "wear-and-
tear" effects of a demanding work environment. Other re-
search, however, indicates that physical demands in late
life jobs have positive benefits for men's health, after con-
trolling for selection into these jobs (Moore & Hayward,
1990). As such, physical demands may actually increase
the relative value of work over leisure. Self-employed hus-
bands and wives, net of all other factors, are more likely
to anticipate delayed retirement. Because we control for
health, and pension and asset wealth, we suggest that this
effect reflects self-employed individuals' flexibility to ad-
just their work behavior in accordance with their health or
preferences for work.
Wives' pension wealth significantly reduces expectations
to delay retirement, although no comparable effect is ob-
served for husbands (but this is not statistically significant).
Among husbands, the absence of health insurance is posi-
tively associated with expectations for delayed retirement as
is nonemployer health insurance coverage. Husbands with
employer-provided health insurance are the least likely to
expect to delay retirement. Unlike our observations of early
retirement expectations, health insurance does not signifi-
cantly shape wives' delayed retirement expectations, and
the difference between husbands and wives is statistically
significant.
Like early retirement expectations, delayed retirement ex-
pectations are related to retirement planning with spouse.
Household planning behavior is associated with expectations
of retiring earlier. Again, the husband's work disability sta-

tus reduces his wife's expectations of working after age 65.
Whether the wife's response to her husband's health needs
reflects the need for caregiving is not clear in our analysis.
When comparing the model fit of the joint GLS estima-
tion (system-weighted R2) with OLS estimation (adjusted
R2), we find that joint GLS may be a somewhat more effi-
cient estimator. For example, in the fully specified models
in Table 2 (Model 2), only 17% (husbands) and 12%
(wives) of the variance in retirement expectations was ex-
plained using OLS, whereas 15% of the variance was
explained with joint GLS estimation. Individually esti-
mated models explained a smaller portion of the variance in
wives' retirement expectations at age 65 than joint models,
as well. This suggests that our models have tapped into im-
portant couple-level dimensions of the planning process,
in particular improving the explanatory model for wives in
dual-earner couples.
DISCUSSION
Like previous research, our analysis demonstrates that
husbands' retirement expectations are shaped by pension
wealth, health, and characteristics of the work environment--
relationships reflecting the institutionalization of retirement
(Szinovacz & DeViney, 1999). Although the factors shaping
wives' expectations are less well known, like husbands',
women's plans respond to working conditions and pension
wealth. Such equivalent pension wealth effects, however,
should be considered alongside studies that report on aggre-
gate gender differences in pension wealth. In our study,
wives have accumulated pension wealth that is one-third the
value of the pension wealth of husbands. Hardy and Shuey
(2000) noted persistent structural differences in women and
men's employer-provided pensions that place women at a
disadvantage. Our results suggest that marriage may provide
an important financial safety net that heightens the impor-
tance of wives' pension wealth in their retirement decision
making, even though their levels of pension wealth lag be-
hind those for men.
Consistent with prior research, we find an association be-
tween early retirement and workers' labor market vulnera-
bilities. Vulnerabilities defined by lower education and being
African American weaken connections to work. In contrast to
Flippen and Tienda (2000), our results indicate that Hispan-
ics' retirement expectations do not differ from those of
Whites. One possible explanation is that the present study
selects only married couples and investigates retirement ex-
pectations rather than retirement behavior.
Characteristics of the spouse and household are important
predictors of retirement expectations. In terms of household
factors, husbands' and wives' expectations of early retire-
ment increase as household wealth increases. Husbands,
though not wives, expect to delay retirement if dependent
children reside in the household. Also, household planning
behaviors tend to accompany spouses' plans to retire early.
This finding suggests that planful behavior in household de-
cision making is important for the joint maximization of lei-
sure among husbands and wives. We observe asymmetry,
however, in the effects of the spouse's health and pension
characteristics on their partner's expectations. Although
most gender differences in spousal effects do not differ sta-
tistically, the pattern of effects points to a stronger influence
of husbands on wives' retirement expectations than vice
versa. Inequity remains a defining feature of retirement de-
cision making within marriage.
An important gender difference to emerge from our anal-
ysis is the extent to which a person's health influences their
retirement expectations. Unlike husbands', wives' expecta-
tions do not appear to be sensitive to health. Given the pre-
eminence of health effects in the retirement literature, the
absence of such effects for wives was unexpected. One pos-
sible explanation is that health problems are less severe
among wives of the ages considered here. On the other hand,
wives are more likely to expect early retirement when their
husbands have a work disability. Wives appear to take into
account their spouse's health rather than their own when
formulating retirement expectations.
Increasingly, economists and sociologists point to the impor-
tance of investigating retirement as a household decision (e.g.,
Anderson et al., 1982; Blau, 1998; Gustman & Steinmeier,
1994; Henretta et al., 1993). Despite growing recognition of the
theoretical importance of household decision-making perspec-
tive, much of the research on retirement behavior continues
to focus on individual resources. The results shown here,
however, demonstrate that retirement expectations are not
simply borne out of an individual's own achievements in the
labor market, but they very much reflect the resources and
expectations of their spouse (particularly for women),
household factors such as asset wealth, and household plan-
ning behavior.
Considerable theoretical and empirical research rein-
forces the idea that husbands and wives invest in marriage.
Forms of family organization develop early in marriages out
of negotiations involving work/family activities. Because
lifelong family organizational strategies maintain and en-
hance family well-being, it should not be surprising that re-
tirement decisions are intimately tied to planning behavior,
household factors, and the spouse's expectations and re-
sources. This conclusion speaks to institutional factors that
reinforce retirement as a family decision. Social Security
benefits in particular are structured not on individuals' earn-
ings histories, but on the earnings history of the husband
and wife within a family. As policy makers plan to address
concerns surrounding a growing pool of older workers, it is
important to be mindful of the pairing of retirement plans
and retirement behavior (Henretta & O'Rand, 1983) that oc-
curs through marriage. Very often, it is neither his retire-
ment nor her retirement but their retirement that alters the
landscape of pension beneficiaries and the timing of retire-
ment in the population.
