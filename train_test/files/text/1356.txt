OBJECTIVE -- To develop a score to predict impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) using com-
mon clinical data.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) for 2,746 individuals aged 40­74 years
who completed an oral glucose tolerance test. IGT was defined as a 2-h postchallenge glucose
140 mg/dl (7.7 mmol/l). We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses to describe the
association of IGT with commonly available clinical information. A numerical score to predict
IGT was derived from the results of the multivariate logistic regression models.
RESULTS -- Fasting glucose levels between 101 and 109 mg/dl (5.6 and 6.0 mmol/l) or
between 110 and 125 mg/dl (6.1 and 6.9 mmol/l) were associated with IGT (odds ratio 1.8 and
6.2, respectively; P  0.05). BMI 25 kg/m2, Mexican-American ethnicity, age between 60 and
74 years, hypertension, and triglyceride level 150 mg/dl (1.69 mmol/l) were also associated
with IGT. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for an 8-point scale derived
from the multivariate analysis was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72­0.76). Setting a low cut point of 2 on this
scale resulted in high sensitivity (86%), whereas a high cut point of 6 yielded high specificity
(97%) for the detection of IGT.
CONCLUSIONS -- A numerical score based on common clinical data can identify individ-
uals with a low or high likelihood of having IGT.

Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is an
important intermediate stage in the
natural history of type 2 diabetes (1)
and has been associated with an increased
risk for cardiovascular disease and mor-
tality (2­4). Recent clinical trials report
that lifestyle modifications or pharmaco-
therapy among individuals with IGT can
reduce their risk of developing diabetes
(5,6). The American Diabetes Association
recommends screening for IGT or im-
paired fasting glucose in men and women
age 45 years, particularly in those who
are overweight or obese (7). An oral glu-
cose tolerance test (OGTT) is needed to
diagnose IGT, which is defined as a post-
challenge glucose value between 140 and
200 mg/dl (7.7 and 11.1 mmol/l) and the
absence of a fasting glucose in the diabetic
range (8).
In the clinical setting, OGTTs are
more costly than fasting or random blood
measurements, are burdensome to ad-
minister, and are not commonly per-
formed. Using only an elevated fasting
plasma glucose to identify individuals at
high risk for glucose intolerance is inade-
quate and will miss a substantial propor-
tion of individuals with IGT (8,9). Some
authors advocate screening high-risk
populations with OGTTs, regardless of
their fasting glucose level, whereas others
do not (10­13). The purpose of this study
was to examine the association of com-
monly available clinical characteristics
known to be associated with IGT using a
nationally representative U.S. dataset and
to derive a numerical score based on
readily available clinical information to
predict presence of IGT.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study population
The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) was
conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics at 89 U.S. survey loca-
tions between 1988 and 1994. The survey
used a stratified multistage probability
cluster design with oversampling of Mex-
ican Americans, African Americans, and
the elderly. The survey consisted of mul-
tiple components including a household
interview, a physical examination, and
laboratory tests. Descriptions of the stan-
dardized protocols used for all interview,
laboratory, and physical examinations
have been previously published (14).
We analyzed data from 2,746 indi-
viduals between the ages of 40 and 74
years who had completed a 2-h OGTT. A
detailed description of the OGTT meth-
odology has been previously published
(8). We excluded individuals who re-
ported a previous diagnosis of diabetes
and those who had a fasting plasma glu-
cose 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) (14). For
the current study, IGT was defined as a
2-h postchallenge glucose 140 mg/dl

(7.7 mmol/l). We included 128 individu-
als with a 2-h postchallenge glucose
200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) and a fasting
plasma glucose 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/
l). By definition, these individuals have
diabetes and would require further clini-
cal intervention (15). Even though the
outcome as we have defined it includes
individuals with diabetes diagnosed only
by the OGTT, we will refer to the outcome
as "IGT" throughout the rest of the article.
Data were collected on other known
risk factors for IGT and diabetes (15).
Standing height and weight were ob-
tained during the physical examination
and were used to calculate BMI. Individ-
uals were considered obese if their BMI
was 30 kg/m2 and were considered
overweight if their BMI was between 25
and 29.9 kg/m2 (16). Individuals were
considered to have a family history of di-
abetes if they reported that any first-
degree relative had diabetes. Criteria for
the metabolic syndrome included ab-
dominal obesity (waist circumference
102 cm for men and 88 cm for wom-
en), a triglyceride level 150 mg/dl (1.69
mmol/l), and a serum HDL level 40
mg/dl (1.04 mmol/l) for men and 50
mg/dl (1.29 mmol/l) for women (17,18).
Individuals were considered to have hy-
pertension if they had a measured blood
pressure reading 140/90 mmHg or they
reported being told by their physician
that they had high blood pressure.
Statistical analysis
Data were weighted to account for the un-
equal probability of selection that resulted
from the survey cluster design, nonre-
sponse, and oversampling of certain tar-
get populations (19,20). Sampling
weights were used to calculate population
estimates, and sampling strata and pri-
mary sampling units were accounted for
to estimate variances and test for signifi-
cant differences. Statistical analysis was
performed using Stata 7.0 software
(21,22) to take into account the complex
sampling design. All results are presented
as unweighted counts (n) and weighted
percentages and odds ratios (ORs). Pear-
son's 2 test was used to determine biva-
riate associations between socioeconomic
and health characteristics of IGT.
We developed two multivariate mod-
els with the presence of IGT as the main
dependent variable. The independent
variables in the multivariate models in-
cluded clinical characteristics associated
with IGT in bivariate analysis or from pre-
viously published literature (8,11). The
first model will be referred to as the "clin-
ical model" and includes those data most
likely to be available at a routine clinical
encounter, including sex, age, race/
ethnicity, family history of diabetes, BMI,
fasting glucose, and blood pressure. The
second model will be referred to as the
"full model" and includes these covariates
in addition to abdominal obesity and ad-
ditional laboratory tests (triglyceride and
HDL level). All continuous independent
variables were entered into models in cat-
egorical form.
For the full multivariate model, we
assessed goodness of fit with the Hosmer-
Lemeshow test (22). We tested interac-
tion terms between age, sex, and race/
ethnicity. The risk of IGT predicted for
each person by the full multivariate model
was used to define the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve. To assess the external validity of
the full multivariate model, we used an
internal bootstrap technique (23) to esti-
mate the area under the ROC curve for the
predicted probability of IGT. We also
tested the full multivariate model among a
subsample of individuals with a BMI 24
kg/m2 and a fasting blood glucose be-
tween 95 and 125 mg/dl, entry criteria for
two recent diabetes prevention trials
(5,6).
We created a simplified 8-point score
by replacing significant multivariate
model coefficients (P  0.05) with integer
values (24) as follows: a value of 1 for a
significant multivariate OR between 1.1
and 1.9, 2 for an OR between 2.0 and 2.9,
and 3 for an OR of 3. An ROC curve was
used to describe the diagnostic properties
of the 8-point scale.
The ROC curve plots the sensitivity as

a function of 1  specificity (the false-
positive rate). In this study, cut points of
the scale score were examined. The sensi-
tivity refers to the percentage of individ-
uals with IGT whose score was above the
cut point. If the sensitivity increases as the
cut point increases, with a disproportion-
ately smaller increase in the false-positive
rate, the area under the ROC curve will be
large. The ROC curve area is smaller if
false-positive cases accumulate more rap-
idly as the cut point increases. The area
under the ROC curve represents the prob-
ability that a subject chosen at random
from a group of people with IGT had a
higher point value than an individual
without IGT. Likelihood ratios were cal-
culated for each cut point of the score.
The likelihood ratio for a positive test re-
sult is the ratio of the probability of a pos-
itive test result among the truly positive
subjects to the probability of the positive
test result among truly negative subjects.
Similarly, the likelihood ratio for a nega-
tive test result is the ratio of the probabil-
ity of a negative test result among the truly
positive subjects to the probability of a
negative test result among the truly nega-
tive subjects.
Analyses of the area under the ROC
curves were used to assess the full multi-
variate model and the 8-point score. We
calculated the SE of the area under the
ROC curve and compared areas under the
ROC curve (22). Comparisons of the area
under the ROC curve were examined for
the full model, the use of fasting glucose
alone to predict IGT, and the application
of the model to a subpopulation eligible
for diabetes prevention trials (5,6).
RESULTS -- The population charac-
teristics of the sample are displayed in Ta-
ble 1. The majority of the sample was
white, and 53% were women. Over one-
third of the participants had high blood
pressure, an elevated serum triglyceride
level, or a low serum HDL level. The ma-
jority of the sample was either overweight
or obese, and almost half of the respon-
dents had abdominal obesity. Of the sam-
ple, 21% had IGT (n  686). Bivariate
correlates of IGT are displayed in Table 1
and include increasing age, Mexican-
American ethnicity, and impaired fasting
glucose. Characteristics of the metabolic
syndrome, including obesity, hyperten-
sion, elevated triglycerides, and low se-
rum HDL, were also associated with IGT.
An individual's sex or a family history of
diabetes was not significantly associated
with IGT.
Table 2 presents the results from mul-
tivariate logistic regression models pre-
dicting IGT (F statistic for clinical and full
model, P  0.0000). In the clinical
model, using the most commonly avail-
able clinical variables, the strongest asso-
ciation with IGT is impaired fasting
glucose between 110 and 125 mg/dl (6.1
and 6.9 mmol/l) (OR 6.2, 95% CI 3.5­
10.9). Other significant associations in-
clude Mexican-American ethnicity, age
between 60 and 74 years, obesity, and hy-
pertension. When other characteristics of
the metabolic syndrome, including ele-
vated triglycerides, low HDL, and abdom-
inal obesity, are added in the full model,
obesity is no longer independently asso-
ciated with IGT. Interactions between
age, sex, and race/ethnicity were not
found to be significantly associated with
the presence of IGT (data not shown). The
area under the ROC curve for the full mul-
tivariate model predicting IGT was 0.76
(95% CI 0.72­0.78). The difference in
the area under the ROC curve obtained by
the bootstrap procedure compared with
the original sample was 0.008. The Hos-
mer-Lemeshow test did not reject the
goodness of fit of the full model (P 
0.11). The full multivariate model had
similar predictive ability for the sub-
sample of individuals with a fasting blood
glucose between 95 and 125 mg/dl and a
BMI 24 kg/m2 (area under the ROC
curve 0.73 [95% CI 0.71­0.75], P  0.06
compared with the entire study sample).
When we excluded the 128 individuals
with a 2-h OGTT value of 200 mg/dl
from the analysis, no difference was noted
in the predictive ability of the full model
(area under the ROC curve 0.76 [95% CI
0.73­0.77], P  0.13 compared with the
entire study sample).
Table 3 presents a scoring system
based on the results of the multivariate
regression analyses. The highest possible
score is 8. Because obesity was significant
in the first model and not in the full model
after the addition of triglyceride level, two
scores were created: one using the triglyc-
eride level and one using obesity. Table 4

scoring system. The area under the ROC
curve is 0.74 (95% CI 0.72­0.76), which
is significantly larger than the area under
the ROC curve for fasting glucose level
alone (0.69 [95% CI 0.67­0.72], P 
0.002). The area under the ROC curve
was similar when obesity was used in-
stead of triglyceride value to calculate the
score (data not shown).
Table 4 highlights two cut points in
the score that may be clinically useful.
When a low cut point is set (for example,
if the test is considered positive with a
score 2), the sensitivity of the score is
high. A total of 86% of individuals with
IGT had a score 2. Forty-eight percent
of the sample had a score 2. When the
cut point is set high (for example, if the
test is considered positive with a score of
6), the specificity is high. Of those with-
out IGT, 97% had a score 6. The posi-
tive likelihood ratio of 6.0 for a score of
6 and the negative likelihood ratio of
0.2 for a score 2 both generate a mod-
erate shift in the pretest to posttest prob-
ability of IGT (25).
CONCLUSIONS -- We present a
simple 8-point score based on commonly
available clinical data that accurately pre-
dicts individuals at low and high risk of
having IGT. This scale performs signifi-
cantly better than fasting glucose level
alone in identifying individuals with IGT.
When a low cut point of 2 is used to de-
fine a positive test, the sensitivity of the
test is high (86%). Thus, individuals with
a score 2 have a low likelihood of hav-
ing the disease. Further oral glucose tol-
erance testing may not be necessary in this
low-risk group, which comprises almost
half of this nationally representative pop-
ulation of individuals aged 40­74 years.
When a higher cut point of 6 is used
to define a positive test, the specificity of
the test increases and most individuals
(97%) without IGT have a score of 6.
Thus, individuals with a score 6 have a
high likelihood of having IGT. Targeting
individuals with scores 6 for OGTTs
may help identify individuals at high risk
for IGT and diabetes among individuals
with fasting plasma glucose levels in the
nondiabetic range. An intermediate score
between 2 and 6 will not help clinicians
determine the risk of IGT, but lifestyle in-
terventions should be targeted in individ-
uals with low HDL, high triglycerides,
and obesity, independent of IGT (18,26).
The outcome of the prediction model in-
cluded 128 subjects with diabetes based
on a 2-h glucose of 200 mg/dl (11.1
mmol/l) and a fasting glucose in the non-
diabetic range. Although diabetes and
IGT are distinct categories in terms of glu-
cose tolerance classification, the identifi-
cation of either may lead to similar clinical
interventions.
The strength of this study is the use of
nationally representative data (8). Our re-
sults add important evidence for screen-
ing individuals at high risk of IGT based
on commonly available clinical data. Pre-
vious authors have not advocated using
clinical data to predict IGT (11). In a pop-
ulation-based study conducted in Swe-
den, a high-risk screening strategy based
on obesity and family history did not de-
tect the majority of individuals with IGT
(11). However, this study had a lower rate
of obesity than in the U.S., did not use
triglyceride or HDL levels in analyses, and
did not combine multiple risk factors into
a numerical score. Limitations of our
study include the use of self-reported data
of socioeconomic and health characteris-
tics that are subject to recall and other
biases. In addition, NHANES III only al-
lows for population estimates among
white, African-American, and Mexican-
American populations and does not have
adequate sample size to make estimates
about Asian- or Native-American popula-
tions.
Recent clinical trials demonstrated
that diabetes can be prevented by behav-
ioral and pharmacological interventions
among high-risk populations (5,6). Indi-
viduals were included in these clinical tri-
als if they had an abnormal glucose
tolerance, defined by a 2-h response to a
fixed glucose load. Because of cost and
inconvenience, the OGTT is rarely used in
clinical practice. We present a simple
score based on commonly available clini-
cal data to differentiate individuals at both
low and high risk for the presence of IGT.
