The effect of health
education in patients with
chronic low back pain
Yan Zhang1,*, Li Wan2,* and Xueqiang Wang3
Abstract
Objective: To assess the value of health education (active management and postural hygiene) over
and above exercise alone, in patients with chronic low back pain.
Methods: Adults (aged 18­30 years) with low back pain of !3 months'duration were randomized
to undergo a 12-week programme of lumbar strengthening exercise and health education or
exercise alone. Pain, disability (Oswestry Disability Index, ODI), static and dynamic muscle
endurance, and health-related quality-of-life (short form-36, SF-36) were assessed at baseline and
after completion of treatment.
Results: At the end of the 12-week intervention period, pain, disability, SF-36 physical component
and SF-36 mental component were significantly better in the health education group (n ¼ 25) than
in the control group (n ¼ 24). There were no significant between-group differences in static or
dynamic endurance.
Conclusion: Health education provides additional benefits to exercise alone for improving pain,
disability and mental and physical health-related quality-of-life.

Introduction
Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal
disorder, affecting 80% of people at some
point in their lifetime.1 In the USA, total
direct and indirect costs of low back pain
amount to more than $100 billion annually.2
Chronic low back pain is treated with exer-
cise3­5 or health education (active manage-
ment and/or postural hygiene). Active
management avoids bed rest and those

movements that worsen pain, and promotes
physical activity.6 The aim of postural
hygiene is to train the patient how to
perform daily activities in such a way that
back muscle tension and spinal load are
reduced.7
European guidelines for the management
of chronic low back pain recommend edu-
cational interventions to reduce disability
and sick leave.8 The concurrent use of health
education and conventional care can lead to
improvements in pain, disability and health-
related quality-of-life,9 although some have
found no significant differences between
control and health education groups in
rates of self-reported pain, disability or
sick leave.10 It is unclear whether health
education programmes can benefit patients
with chronic low back pain.
The present study assessed the effects of a
12-week health education programme plus
lumbar strengthening exercises versus
lumbar strengthening exercises alone on
pain, disability and health-related quality-
of-life in patients with chronic low back
pain, in order to determine whether health
education was beneficial in these patients.
Patients and methods
Study population
This randomized, controlled study included
college students with chronic low back pain
who were attending Hohai University,
Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. Patients
were recruited between October 2012 and
June2013, and were requiredto be aged18­30
years and havelow back pain (with or without
radiating pain to the lower extremity) of !3
months' duration. Exclusion criteria were: (i)
visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score >8 (0,
no pain; 10, worst pain); (ii) previous partici-
pation in a health education programme; (iii)
previous spinal surgery; (iv) acute infection,
progressive neurological deficit, structural
anomaly, severe instability, severe cardiovas-
cular or metabolic disease. All patients
completed a questionnaire prior to random-
ization,whichcollectedinformationincluding
basic demographic data, medical history,
exercise habits (frequency and time/session),
and past and present job status. Participants
were allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to either the
health education group or the control group
by computer-generated random number
sequence.
The Ethics Committee of Hohai
University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province,
China approved the study and all patients
provided written informed consent prior to
enrolment.
Intervention
All patients performed lumbar strengthen-
ing exercises three times a week (40 min each
session) for 12 weeks, focusing on trunk
flexor and extensor muscles.4 Exercise pro-
grammes were led by registered physical
therapists. Each session included: (i) 5-min
warm-up; (ii) 15-min trunk flexor strength
exercises, including straight leg raises and
sit-ups with foot fixation; (iii) 15-min trunk
extensor strength exercises, including prone
trunk extensions; (iv) 5-min cool-down.
Patients in the health education group
underwent education sessions once a week
for 12 weeks. Sessions included a lecture
(30 min) followed by discussion (10 min),
and information was delivered by videos,
computer presentations and instruction leaf-
lets. Content included active management
and postural hygiene, such as avoiding risk
factors for back problems, safe lifting prac-
tices at home and work, and correct postures
for decreasing back muscle tension and
spinal load.
Outcome measures
Outcome measures were assessed at baseline
and at the end of the 12-week intervention
programme by an investigator who was
blinded to group allocation (L. W.)
816 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
Outcome measures included: (i) pain inten-
sity (VAS)11; (ii) Oswestry Disability Index
(ODI); higher values indicate more severe
disability12; (iii) static muscle endurance13
(length of time (in s) that the patient could
hold their unsupported upper body in the
prone [trunk extensors] and supine [trunk
flexors] positions); (iv) dynamic muscle
endurance4 (number of curl-ups [trunk flex-
ors] and prone trunk extensions [trunk
extensors] performed in 1 min, to a max-
imum of 25); (v) health-related quality-of-
life(Short Form-36 [SF-36] Health Survey,14
higher scores indicate better quality-of-life).
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as meanÆ SD. Between-
group comparisons of baseline data were
made using 2-test or independent samples t-
test. Treatment effects were evaluated using
two-way analysis of variance (group Â time).
Statistical analyses were performed using
Microsoft Office ExcelÕ 2007 software and
SPSSÕ version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study recruited 60 patients. After exclu-
sions and withdrawals, the final analysis
included 49 patients (health education group
n ¼ 25, control group n ¼ 24; Figure 1).
Baseline demographic and clinical charac-
teristics are shown in Table 1. There were no
statistically significant between-group differ-
ences in any baseline data.

Table 2 shows data for all outcome
measures at the end of the 12-week inter-
vention period. Patients in the health edu-
cation group had significantly better pain,
disability, SF-36 physical component and
SF-36 mental component scores than those
in the control group (P < 0.001, P ¼ 0.025,
P < 0.001 and P ¼ 0.011 respectively,
Table 2). There were no statistically signifi-
cant between-group differences in static or
dynamic muscle endurance.
Discussion
This randomized, controlled study com-
pared health education plus exercise with
exercise alone for the treatment of chronic
low back pain, and found that health edu-
cation provided additional benefits in terms
of pain severity, disability and physical and
mental health-related quality-of-life com-
pared with exercise alone.
The added value of health education
remains unclear. Some studies found health
education can reduce pain15 and absence
from work,16 but a critical review of nine
randomized controlled clinical trials found
no effect of education on preventing low
back pain.10 The findings of the present
study indicate that health education inter-
vention is effective for improving pain and
disability in patients with chronic low back
pain. This may be accomplished by the
educational goals of reducing anxiety and
encouraging patients to self-manage their
pain actively. The short duration of the
education programme may explain the lack
of significant between-group differences in

muscle endurance in the present study. It is
possible that a longer education programme
may result in improved static or dynamic
muscle endurance.
The present study had several limitations.
First, the study population included only
patients aged 18­30 years, and the findings
therefore cannot be applied across all age
groups. Further studies are required to
determine the value of health education in
other age groups, such as the elderly.
Secondly, it was not possible for patients
and physical therapists to be blinded to
group allocation. Thirdly, the sample size
was small, limiting the value of the findings.
Finally, there was no long-term follow-up in
our study.
In conclusion, health education provides
additional benefits over and above lumbar
exercise alone for improving the pain, dis-
ability and health-related quality-of-life of
young patients (aged 18­30 years) with
chronic low back pain. It remains to be
seen whether this is the case in other age
groups.
