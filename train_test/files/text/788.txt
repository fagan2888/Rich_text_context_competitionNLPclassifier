Assessment of Weighting Methodology for the National Comorbidity Survey
R. J. A. Little,12 S. Lewitzky,12 S. Heeringa,12 J. Lepkowski,12 and R. C. Kessler2
The authors studied weighting adjustments for the National Comorbidity Survey (1990-1992), a large-scale
national epidemiologic investigation of the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of psychiatric morbidity
and comorbidity in the United States. Weighting adjustments for differential selection within households, new
construction, unit nonresponse, and poststratification were examined separately and in combination. Specific
issues addressed included the magnitude of the bias incurred from ignoring the weights, the added variance
from weighting and how well this was predicted by simple formulae, and the performance of methods for
trimming the weights. Weights had quite modest effects on point estimates of prevalences but resulted in
major increases in variance unless trimmed. The weights after trimming and poststratification appeared to
work well. It is suggested that the added variance from weighting be carefully monitored in similar surveys.
Alternatives to the use of trimming for controlling variance are worth exploring. Am J Epidemiol 1997;146:

epidemiologic methods; mental health; selection bias; study design; weighting
In estimating prevalences from epidemiologic sur-
vey data, people with the characteristic of interest may
be more or less likely to participate in the survey than
people without it. The sample proportion is then a
biased estimator of the true proportion. The standard
statistical approach to adjustment for this potential
bias is to estimate the probability of each respondent's
participating in the survey and to assign each obser-
vation a weight inversely proportional to that proba-
bility (1). This form of weighting is quite different
from weighting in inverse proportion to variance in
regression analysis, where the objective is variance
reduction rather than reduction of bias from differen-
tial inclusion probabilities.
Although the use of survey weights for analytic
inferences such as regression is still debated (1-6),
most statisticians advocate the use of weights for es-
timates of prevalence and other descriptive means and
totals. A common disadvantage of weighting is an
increase in the variance of the estimator. Under sim-
plified independent sampling and constant variance

assumptions, the added variance can be expressed as
Vw
= VB
(1 + si) (1)
(see Kish (1) and Potter (7), for example), where Vu
is
the variance of the unweighted prevalence estimate,
Vw
is the variance of the weighted prevalence, and
si, is the sample variance of the weights, assumed to be
scaled to average unity. This formula does not apply
exactly to stratified multistage surveys involving post-
stratification but has proven to be a useful rule of
thumb in some surveys (for example, see Verma et al.
(8)). Since weighting is questionable when added vari-
ance dominates bias reduction (1), modifications of
the weights to reduce variance, such as trimming (7),
collapsing weight strata (9, 10), or shrinking (6, 11),
are common in practice.
Does weighting improve inferences in practice?
This depends on the nature of the weighting adjust-
ments in particular surveys and how they relate to the
survey outcomes. Korn and Graubard (12, 13) studied
the effects of weighting in large health surveys. Here,
we study weighting adjustments for the National Co-
morbidity Survey (NCS), a major epidemiologic in-
vestigation of the prevalence, risk factors, and conse-
quences of psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity in
the United States (14). Specific questions addressed
include: How much bias is incurred from ignoring the
weights? How much variance is added from weight-
ing, and is it justified by reduced bias? How well is the
added variance predicted using equation 1? How suc-

cessful are weight trimming methods in reducing the
increase in variance while at the same time adjusting
for bias? Weight components are considered individ-
ually as well as in combination in addressing these
questions. Implications of our answers for other men-
tal health surveys are discussed.
The scope of this paper is limited to estimators of
the prevalences of psychiatric disorders, nationally
and in one population subgroup. We describe four
"participation factors" that affect the probability that a
given subject is sampled and participates in the NCS.
We describe how these probabilities and the corre-
sponding weights are estimated, poststratified, and
trimmed. We then examine the effect of the weights,
individually and in combination, on the bias, variance,
and mean squared error of our estimates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The National Comorbidity Survey
The NCS was a general population survey carried
out in 1990-1992 to examine the prevalences, risk
factors, and consequences associated with various psy-
chiatric disorders (14). It was based on a stratified,
multistage area probability sample of persons aged
15-54 years in the noninstitutionalized civilian popu-
lation of the 48 coterminous US states. A total of 8,098
respondents participated in the survey, resulting in a
response rate of 82.4 percent. Our analysis focused on
estimates of prevalence of the 14 main psychiatric
disorders diagnosed for the full sample: alcohol abuse
or dependency, depression, social phobia, conduct dis-
order, drug abuse, simple phobia, agoraphobia, dys-
thymia, antisocial behavior, anxiety disorder, panic
disorder, antisocial personality, mania, and hypoma-
nia. Each disorder was treated as a dichotomous vari-
able. Diagnoses were based on the diagnostic system
of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R) (15),
generated from a modified version of the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (16), a structured
interview designed to be used by trained interviewers
who are not clinicians.
Weighting methodology for the NCS
The NCS was designed to yield an equal probability
sample of households. However, the probability of
participation varied because of four main factors: a
within-household factor, a hold-back factor, a new
construction factor, and a unit nonresponse factor. For
each respondent, weights were estimated for each of
these factors and were multiplied together to obtain the
overall weight, which was inversely proportional to
the estimated probability of participation.
As is common in surveys of this kind, the weights in
this process were modified in an attempt to improve
their statistical properties. The highest values of indi-
vidual and final weights were trimmed back to reduce
variance. The trimmed final weight was poststratified
to adjust for differences between our sample and na-
tional data available from a larger survey. Finally, the
resulting poststratified weights were again trimmed.
Our goal was to examine the impact of this complex
weighting process on prevalence estimates.
Within-household weight. Interviewers were in-
structed to select at random one person aged 15-54
years from each selected household for interview, and
only these target respondents were interviewed. Thus,
individuals in large households had a smaller chance
of selection. Specifically, if a target respondent was
successfully interviewed in a household containing k
people between the ages of 15 and 54 years, the
respondent had a Ilk probability of being selected as
the target from that household and therefore received
a within-household weight proportional to k. Two ad-
justments were made to this basic procedure. First,
people aged 15-24 years tend to live in large house-
holds; to increase the sample size for this group, each
household member aged 15-24 was double-listed prior
to selection for a random one third of all targeted
households. The within-household weight for these
respondents was adjusted to account for this double
listing. Second, less than 0.3 percent of the 8,098
respondents had within-household weights greater
than 6. These respondents had their weights trimmed
to a value of 6. The final distribution of the within-
household weights is shown in figure 1. Scaled to
average unity, weights ranged from 0.52 to 5.87, with
a standard deviation of 0.48.
Hold-back weight The survey was conducted in
six phases, or rotations, each in itself a nationally
representative random sample. For completion of as
much of the final rotation as possible, near the close of
fieldwork targeted individuals in the final rotation who
had not yet been successfully interviewed were ran-
domly divided into two halves. One half was "held
back," and interviewers focused their efforts on the
other half. Each interviewed subject in the half not
held back was then assigned a hold-back weight pro-
portional to 2, whereas all other respondents received
a hold-back weight proportional to 1. Only 3.3 percent
of respondents received the larger of the two hold-
back weights, so the impact of the hold-back weight
on variance was expected to be minor. Scaled to
average unity, the weights ranged from 0.97 to 1.94,
with a standard deviation of 0.17.

New construction weight. As in many multistage
household surveys, the primary sampling units and
secondary sampling units were selected with probabil-
ity proportional to 1980 US Census household totals.
The number of sample households from a secondary
sampling unit thus varied according to the ratio of the
current number of households to the 1980 Census
measure of size. Excessive interviewer workloads re-
sulted in 34 secondary sampling units, mainly because
of large-scale housing construction undertaken since
the 1980 Census. To reduce interviewer burden in
these secondary sampling units, households were ran-
domly subsampled with rates from one half to one fifth
before the sample was released to the field. Respon-
dents then received new construction weights ranging
initially from 2 to 5, compared with 1 for other re-
spondents. Less than 1 percent of the 8,098 observa-
tions with new construction weights greater than 3
were later trimmed to a value of 3. Since less than 4
percent of the sample had new construction weights
more than 1, the impact of this weighting adjustment
was expected to be minor. Scaled to average unity,
weights ranged from 0.63 to 2.85, with a standard
deviation of 0.27.
Nonresponse weight. Previous research has shown
that nonrespondents in mental health surveys have
higher rates of psychiatric disorders than respondents
(17, 18). To assess this issue in the NCS, a nonrespon-
dent survey was carried out, consisting of a brief
(20-minute) screening interview administered to a
probability sample of nonrespondents. The interview
included screening questions selected from the larger
interview for the main DSM-HI-R disorders, as well as
questions on basic demographic data. Of the 831 non-
respondents selected, 353 responded, 128 could not be
contacted (mainly because they had moved and could
not be traced), and 350 refused to participate. The
relatively high interview rate (50 percent) among the
contacted participants was achieved by the low burden
coupled with a substantial financial incentive ($50).
Participants in the nonrespondent study did, in fact,
report higher prevalences of most DSM-ITf-R disor-
ders than respondents (19). The bias was adjusted by
means of a two-step weighting process. First, the 353
participants in the nonrespondent survey were
weighted using the method of propensity score adjust-
ment (20) to match the distribution of all NCS nonre-
spondents on 1) household characteristics recorded at
first attempted contact (for example, whether there
were "No Trespassing" signs posted) and 2) block-
level characteristics from the 1990 Census (for exam-
ple, percentage of block residents living in poverty and
percentage living alone). Second, the respondents
were weighted using a second propensity-score adjust-
ment to match the combined distribution of respon-
dents and nonrespondents on variables appearing in
both the full and nonrespondent interviews. The final
distribution of nonresponse weights is shown in figure
2. Scaled to average unity, they ranged from 0.81 to
82.27, with a standard deviation of 1.04.
Poststratification and posttrimming. The weighted
distribution of NCS participants across demographic
groups was compared with the distribution estimated

from the 1989 National Health Interview Survey
(NfflS) (21). The NHIS measured this distribution
more precisely, since it was based on a much larger
sample with a very high response rate. Poststratifica-
tion was applied to adjust the NCS distribution across
demographic groups to match the NHIS distribution.
To the extent that the prevalence of a given psychiatric
disorder is correlated with these demographic vari-
ables, poststratification improves the NCS estimate of
the national prevalence of this disorder (10, 22). A
demographic variable was included in the poststratifi-
cation if 1) reliable NHIS data were available, 2) its
data distribution in the NHIS differed from the distri-
bution in the NCS, and 3) the variable was signifi-
cantly related to the DSM-III-R disorders. The number
of poststrata was limited to eight to avoid excess
variance that arose when the NCS respondents were
too sparsely distributed across the categories. The final
poststrata were:
1. High school education or less, lives with others.
2. High school education or less, lives alone.
3. More than high school education, lives alone,
lives in a metropolitan area with >250,000 peo-
pie.
4. More than high school education, lives with oth-
ers, lives in a metropolitan area with >250,000
people, not in Midwest, not Hispanic.
5. More than high school education, lives with oth-
ers, lives in a metropolitan area with > 250,000
people, not in Midwest, Hispanic.
6. More than high school education, lives with oth-
ers, lives in an urban Metropolitan Statistical
Area with >250,000 people, in Midwest.
7. More than high school education, lives with oth-
ers, lives in an urban non-Metropolitan Statistical
Area with >250,000 people, in Midwest.
8. More than high school education, lives in a met-
ropolitan area with <250,000 people.
For any given demographic category, the poststrati-
fication weight is proportional to the ratio of the
proportion of people in that category estimated by
the NHIS to the proportion in that category esti-
mated by the NCS, where the latter includes the four
weighting adjustments discussed above. In order to
minimize seasonality effects, poststratification was
applied separately to each of the 12 monthly sam-
ples in a year. The resulting poststratification
weights were then multiplied by the product of the
four weights described above to yield poststratified
weights. A final trimming reduced all weights fall-
ing into the highest 1.5th percentile to the 98.5th
percentile. The distribution of the final weights after
poststratification and trimming is shown in figure 3.

ation of 0.97.
Variance estimation
The variance of estimates was estimated using the
jackknife repeated replications method, which ac-
counts for the complex sample design (2, 23). The
replications were 2H = 84 sampling error computation
units, consisting of 46 primary sampling units sampled
with a probability less than 1 and 38 random groupings
of secondary sampling units within primary sampling
units selected with a probability of 1. These 84 sam-
pling error computation units were classified into H =
42 relatively homogeneous randomly ordered pairs
according to geography and urbanicity. For example,
one replicate contained two urban northeastern pri-
mary sampling units, another contained two farm belt
rural primary sampling units, and so on.
Let Qw
be the estimate of a prevalence 0 for some
weighting scheme w. For j -- 1, ..., H, let 0jj be the
estimate computed like Qw
(including poststratifica-
tion if Qw
is poststratified), but with the weight for the
first of the two randomly ordered primary sampling
units in theyth replicate doubled and the weight of the
second primary sampling unit in theyth replicate set to
zero. The estimated variance of 9U
, is then

Methodology for assessment of weighting
adjustments
Variance comparisons. For a prevalence 0 of
the population, let Qu
be an unweighted estimate from
the sample and let 0^ be an estimate for some weight-
ing scheme. Let Vu
and Vw
denote the variances of Qu
and Qw
, and Vu
and Vw
estimates of these quantities
obtained from jackknifing the replicates. These esti-
mates are compared directly to assess precision. The
direct estimate Vw
is also compared with the rule-of-
thumb estimate from substituting Vu
for Vu
in equation
1, to assess the utility of that formula.
Bias and mean squared error comparisons. To es-
timate bias and mean squared^ error, it is necessary to
assume that one estimator--0O
, for example--is un-
biased. For our analyses, we take as 0O
the estimator
with all of the design and nonresponse weights in-
cluded, and a poststratification adjustment to improve
precision and reduce bias from limitations in the sam-
pling frame. Let 0 , be an estimator of 0 for some
other weighting scheme--the unweighted estimator,
for example--with unknown bias 5,. Let Vo
and V{
denote the variances of 0O
and 0,, respectively, and
let MSE0
and MSE, denote the mean squared errors;
thus, by definition, MSE[ = B\ + Vu
and by as-
sumption MSE0
= Vo
. In addition, f ( 0 , - 0O
) = Bx
and £(0, - 0O
)2 = B\ + V01
, where V01
is the vari-
ance of 0, -- 0O
. Let Vo
, Vx
, and V01
be jackknife
repeated replications estimates of Vo
, Vx
, and V01
.
Then,fl,= 0 , -- 0O
is a consistent estimator of the
bias of 0,, MSEg = Vo
, and
= V, + max{5? - V01
,0} (2)
is a consistent estimate of the mean squared error of
0,. Equation 2 is a refinement of the mean squared
error estimates presented by Kish (1) in that the sub-
traction of Vo
, in the last term corrects for upward bias
of B\ as an estimate of the squared bias. The last term
in equation 2 is constrained to be nonnegative, since it
is estimating a nonnegative quantity. This adjustment
seems justified, although it destroys exact unbiased-
ness. Results with regard to bias and mean squared
error should be interpreted cautiously, since they de-
pend on the choice of estimator 0O
, and the bias may
not be very precisely determined.

ming, and 4) the final weight, with poststratification
and trimming. The disorders are listed in the order of
decreasing prevalence, as estimated by option 4 above.
Estimated standard errors are shown, together with
predicted standard errors for the weighted methods
based on equation 1. Root mean squared errors are
also tabulated according to the methods presented
above, with method 3 assumed to be unbiased. If this
assumption is incorrect, root mean squared error re-
sults are biased in favor of method 3.
Other things being equal, variance increases as a
fraction of mean squared error as the sample size is
reduced. Since weighting tends to reduce bias and
increase variance, one would expect it to be more
useful for estimates based on the entire sample than for
estimates based on a subdomain. The impact of
weighting on subdomain estimates was examined by
repeating the analysis of table 1 for subjects aged
15-24 years, a restriction that reduced the sample size
from 8,098 to 1,769. Results are shown in table 2.
Below, we discuss the results presented in tables 1 and
2 with reference to our original research questions.
How much bias is incurred from ignoring the
weights? Weighting has a modest effect on the esti-
mated prevalences, from a substantive viewpoint. Un-
weighted estimates are generally within 10 percent of
the final weighted estimates, and differences are minor
compared with other potential effects relating to how
a disorder is measured. For example, estimates of
depression can vary greatly depending on how the
condition is operationalized (24). Nevertheless,
weighting adjustments for some disorders--for exam-
ple, depression and dysthymia--are quite large when
compared with the standard errors of the estimates, so
weighting may still be useful for reducing bias and
mean squared error. The differences in weighted and
unweighted estimates are significantly different from
zero for depression and dysthymia (P = 0.005 and
P = 0.018, respectively).
How much added variance is incurred from weight-
ing? Weighting without poststratification or trim-
ming results in marked increases in estimated standard
errors for all disorders except drug use, simple phobia,
agoraphobia, and dysthymia. The most extreme case is
the estimate for hypomania, which has an estimated
standard error 9.9 times that of the unweighted esti-
mate. We initially thought that these large increases
might be attributable to instability in the jackknife
repeated replications method for estimating variance,
but standard errors based on jackknifing of individual
cases yielded similar results. The high estimated vari-
ances are caused by a few cases with these disorders
receiving abnormally high weights.

Weighting for the National Comorbidity Survey 445
How well is the added variance from weighting
predicted using equation 1? For the entire sample,
the predicted standard error of the final weighted es-
timate from equation 1 is close to the observed stan-
dard error for four disorders, but it overestimates the
observed standard error for the other disorders. This
overestimation is approximately halved when post-
stratification is not used. Results for the subclass are
more variable, but equation 1 still has a tendency to
overpredict the standard error. Without trimming, the
large estimated standard errors for some disorders
(caused by outlying weights) are not reflected in the
predicted standard errors from equation 1, resulting in
a tendency for the formula to underpredict the standard
error.
How successful are methods for trimming the
weights in limiting the increase in variance while at the
same time adjusting for bias? For the entire sample,
poststratification without trimming tends to reduce the
variance of the raw weighted estimator. Nevertheless,
in terms of estimated root mean squared error, this
estimator still appears to be worse than the unweighted
estimator for nine disorders; it is about the same for
three disorders and appears to be better for only two
disorders. In the age 15-24 subgroup, poststratifica-
tion without trimming reduces estimated root mean
squared error for four of the 14 disorders and increases
the estimated root mean squared error for 10. Thus,
poststratification does not appear to be very useful for
these estimates.
The final weighted estimator after poststratification
and trimming has smaller estimated standard errors
than the other weighted estimators, suggesting that
trimming has been effective. For the entire sample,
this estimator appears to be best in terms of estimated
root mean squared error, with an average estimated
root mean squared error over all disorders of 0.44
compared with 0.51 for the unweighted estimator.
However, gains over the unweighted estimator are not
uniform across disorders.
The data in table 2 support the idea that weighting is
less useful for estimates in subdomains; root mean
squared errors after poststratification and trimming are
similar to those from the unweighted estimates. One
possible reaction would be to restrict the role of
weighting to estimates made for the entire sample,
although this could introduce undesirable inconsisten-
cies between estimates for the whole sample and for
subdomains.

errors, and root mean squared errors for estimates
based on the entire sample are shown for five weight-
ing schemes: 1) unweighted, 2) weighting only by the
individual component weight, 3) weighting by all but
the individual component weight, 4) weighting by all
of the weighting components, and 5) the final weight,
including poststratification and trimming. Changes
from scheme 1 to scheme 2 and from scheme 3 to
scheme 4 show the effects of the component weight,
without and with the other weights included; scheme 5
allows comparisons with the final estimators.
Of the four component weights, the nonresponse
weight has the largest impact on estimated preva-
lences, raising them by nearly 1 percentage point, on
average. The impact of weighting for nonresponse is
quite significant for some of the rare disorders that
might be associated with higher rates of nonre-
sponse--antisocial behavior, anxiety disorder, panic
disorder, antisocial personality--and the estimated
prevalence of hypomania is doubled from 0.9 percent
to 1.9 percent. However, the estimated variances of
estimates weighted for nonresponse are much higher
than the estimated variances of the unweighted or
trimmed estimates. In addition, the effects of the non-
response weights on final estimated prevalences are
reduced considerably by trimming.
The within-household weight places more weight
on sampled individuals in large households. The effect
of the weight is to reduce the estimated prevalences
of alcoholism, depression, and drug use by approx-
imately 1 percent. Effects on other disorders are
more minor. There is some evidence that the within-
household weight operates in the opposite direction
from the nonresponse weight, so the two weighting
adjustments tend to cancel each other out. For exam-
ple, adding the household weight to the unweighted
estimates increases the variance of the prevalences by
approximately 10 percent, on average. However, add-
ing the within-household weight after all of the other
weights are included has the effect of reducing the
variances by approximately 40 percent, on average,
reflecting a reduction in the weight variability from
inclusion of this component.
The other two weighting components, the new con-
struction weight and the hold-back weight, have much
more minor effects on the estimates and their standard
errors, presumably because these weights apply only
to small proportions of the sample.
DISCUSSION
The effects of weighting on the point estimates were
modest from a substantive point of view; the un-
weighted estimates were far from disastrous. How-
ever, it would be dangerous to conclude from this

single application that weights can always be ignored
in surveys of mental disorders. Bias has a more insid-
ious effect on inferences than does variance, since it is
often left unmeasured, and in general we prefer an
approach that corrects for bias provided that the im-
pact on variance is not too great. From this perspec-
tive, our general conclusion is that the overall weight-
ing strategy, with poststratification and trimming, was
quite successful, resulting in reduced root mean
squared error for the estimates made for the entire
sample and root mean squared errors comparable with
those for the unweighted estimates in the age 15-24
subdomain. In the latter case, the superior theoretical
properties of the weighted estimates seem to justify
weighting, even though useful reductions in root mean
squared error were not found empirically.
An important limitation of this study is that it re-
ports results for a single survey, albeit an important
one. Other surveys may have different sample sizes,
weighting characteristics, and weight trimming strate-
gies, so it is hard to generalize the findings of the
present study. However, some tentative comments can
be made. The raw weights without adjustment added
much too much variance in the effort to limit bias.
This finding suggests that the increased variance from
weighting should be carefully monitored. This is eas-
ily achieved by directly computing the variances with
and without the weights, using a method such as
jackknife repeated replications that takes into account
other features of the sample design, and checking that
the increase in variance is not excessive. The alterna-
tive approach of using equation 1 to predict the in-
crease in variance does not appear reliable, based on
our empirical evidence.
Methods for reducing added variance from weight-
ing were clearly needed, and the trimming adjustments
were effective. However, from a theoretical perspec-
tive, trimming is ad hoc, and alternative approaches to
variance reduction may yield improved estimates.
These alternatives include weight smoothing based on
random-effects models (6, 19) or estimation based on
predictions from a model that includes the weight as a
covariate (25, 26). Our future work will focus on these
alternative variance reduction methods.
Another limitation of this study is that it examined
estimated rates for the entire sample and for one sub-
domain. Thus, we did not consider measures of asso-
ciation, such as differences in mean values or regres-
sion coefficients. Theory suggests that weighting may
be less important for bias reduction in such analyses,
since biases in comparisons tend to cancel out. Given
the modest support for weighting our study provides
for estimated rates, we would not expect weighting of
analyses of associations to have much payoff in the
setting of the NCS, although that is an empirical
question worthy of further exploration.
In this study, the most important components of the
weighting adjustments were the nonrespondent and
within-household weights. The new construction and
hold-back weights had a limited impact on root mean
squared error, presumably because they affected a
relatively small fraction of the sample. Since weights
for new construction generally affect only a small
fraction of the sample, we expect our findings on that
weight to generalize to other studies. The impact of the
hold-back weight would be greater if the strategy of
subsampling hard-to-reach cases were applied to the
entire sample, rather than to a subset, as was the case
in the NCS. More widespread subsampling of hard-to-
reach persons has the potential of substantially reduc-
ing survey costs, and we are currently studying the
relative efficiency of variants of such a design in the
context of the NCS.
