We examined indices of the health of persons with serious
mental illness. A sample of 100 adults with schizophrenia
and 100 with major mood disorder were recruited from ran-
domly selected outpatients who were receiving community-
based psychiatric treatment. Participants were surveyed
about health indicators using items from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Study III and the Na-
tional Health Interview Survey. Their responses were com-
pared with those of matched samples from the general
population surveys. A total of 1% of persons with serious
mental illness, compared with 10% from the general pop-
ulation sample, met criteria for all 5 of selected health
indicators: nonsmoker, exercise that meets recommended
standards, good dentition, absence of obesity, and absence
of serious medical co-occurring illness. Within the mentally
ill group, educational level, but not a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia versus mood disorder, was independently associ-
ated with a composite measure of health behaviors. We
conclude that an examination of multiple health indicators
may be used to measure overall health status in persons
with serious mental illness.

Introduction
Elevated rates of premature death among individuals
with schizophrenia and major mood disorders have fo-
cused attention on the somatic health problems of per-
sons with serious mental illness.1,2 Health problems
that have been identified include obesity, smoking, sed-
entary lifestyle, and co-occurring medical illnesses.3,4
Most previous studies have focused on these problems
as individual health issues. However, poor health status
and mortality risk are determined by the combination of
several factors that operate synergistically.5 Therefore, it
is important to examine multiple health indicators that
together determine overall health. Applied at the popu-
lation level, a multidimensional perspective facilitates the
comparison of overall health among populations and the
tracking of changes in the overall health of a population
over time.6­8 The analysis of multiple health indicators
may also help to better identify predictors of health
care costs.9 To our knowledge, a multidimensional per-
spective has not been applied to the study of the health
of persons with serious mental illness.
This study examines the health status of persons with
serious mental illness in community-based psychiatric
treatment and compares their health status with that
of matched individuals from the general population. In
addition, within the psychiatric sample we examined
the correlates of composite measures of health status
and the association between health indicators.
Methods
Sample and Procedures
Participants were selected from outpatients aged 18­65
who were receiving psychiatric care at 2 centers in the
Baltimore, Maryland, area: the Department of Psychia-
try at the University of Maryland at Baltimore and the
Sheppard Pratt Health System in Baltimore and Howard
Counties. Participants were selected in order to obtain
a total of 100 individuals with schizophrenia, half with
schizophrenia, excluding schizoaffective disorder, and
half with schizoaffective disorder, and 100 individuals
with affective disorder, half with major depression
and half with bipolar disorder.13 The sample was also
selected so that half of participants were from the urban
University of Maryland center and half from the subur-
ban Sheppard Pratt center; within the latter sample,
patients were drawn equally from 2 suburban sites.
At each site, lists of patients categorized by diagnosis
were obtained from the medical information system.

Patients were excluded if they had not been seen for a visit
within the previous 6 months. Within each diagnostic
group, patients were selected in random order until
the predetermined number of consenting patients was
obtained.
A total of 281 individuals were identified as eligible; of
these 6 were not included for clinical reasons on the ad-
vice of the treating clinician. Of the remaining 275 eligible
individuals, 200 (73%) consented to participate and com-
pleted the study. Individuals declined to participate for
the following reasons: not interested (n = 60); too busy
(n = 9); other (n = 6). Consenters did not significantly dif-
fer from decliners in terms of their age, gender, level of
education, or diagnosis. A higher percentage of consent-
ers were from the urban than the suburban center (81%
vs. 66%, v2 = 7.5, p < .05). The final sample consisted of
200 individuals who provided written informed consent
and were interviewed using an instrument that includes
items from the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS)10 and the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey III (NHANES III).11
We focused on survey items that are consistent with the
leading health indicators for the US population as iden-
tified by the Healthy People 2010 program of the Centers
for Disease Control12: (1) self-report of not smoking a cig-
arette in the previous 30 days; (2) frequency of leisure
physical activity, which was used to calculate whether ex-
ercise met recommended standards (defined as $ 20 times
per month)13; (3) self-report of height and weight from
which the body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated
and categorized as obese if BMI $ 30; (4) absence of
co-occurring lifetime serious medical illness from the
following chronic conditions: arthritis, asthma, chronic
bronchitis, emphysema, diabetes, congestive heart fail-
ure, hypertension, stroke, cancer; (5) self-report of teeth
in good, very good, or excellent condition; and (6) ab-
sence of injury requiring medical treatment in the previ-
ous 90 days. Items 1­5 were from the NHANES III, and
item 6 from the NHIS.
We created several composite measures with the items
that were drawn from the NHANES III: whether the per-
son met criteria for 2 important health behaviors (non-
smoker and exercise, items 1 and 2); and whether the
person met criteria for 3 important health outcomes
(no obesity or co-occurring medical illness and good den-
tition, items 3, 4, and 5). We selected these composites in
order to separate indicators that reflected more lifestyle
choices (eg, behaviors) from those that are intermediate
health outcomes. The third summary measure was
whether the person met the criteria for all 5 items used
in the composites. We operationally defined an individual
as in the unhealthy category when any one of the com-
posite constituent health items was rated as unhealthy,
even if 1 or more of the constituent items was missing.
The institutional review boards of the participating insti-
tutions approved the study.
The mean age of the psychiatric sample was 44.0 (SD =
8.9); a total of 105 (52.5%) were female and 112 (56%)
were Caucasian. Among the non-Caucasians, 71 of 88
(81%) were African American; 6 of 88 (7%) were Asian
or Pacific Islanders; 5 of 88 (6%) were Native American;
and 6 of 88 (7%) identified themselves as ``other.'' The
mean years of education was 12.7 (SD = 3.0). By design,
half of the sample had a chart diagnosis of schizophrenia
and the other half a major mood disorder. The mood dis-
order group was on average older than the schizophrenia
group (45.7 years, SD = 8.3 vs. 42.3 years, SDþ 9.2; t =
2.65 [df = 198, p < .009]); more female (68% vs. 37%; v2 =
18.05 [df = 1], p < .0001); and more Caucasian (65% vs.
47%; v2 = 5.86 [df = 1], p < .02).
To compare responses of our sample with the general
US population, we randomly selected respondents from
the NHANES III and NHIS datasets who were matched
to study participants by gender, age (within 3 years), and
race. Asian individuals and Pacific Islanders in our sam-
ple (6 of 200) were excluded from comparisons of
NHANES III items because Asian/Pacific Islanders
could not be identified from NHANES III ethnicity
data. The Native Americans in the study sample (5 of
200) were also not included in the analyses because there
were few match candidates. The matched datasets in-
cluded 191 of the 200 study participants for the NHIS
and 185 of the 200 for the NHANES III items. Except
for a few cases, there were 15 matches from the NHANES
III and the NHIS per study participant. Because of dif-
ficulty in matching the ethnicity of some of the psychiat-
ric study participants, the NHIS matches were based on
191, and the NHANES on 185, study participants; a total
of N = 3052 comprised the total sample for the compar-
isons with the NHIS and N = 2890 from the NHANES
III.14,15 The sample sizes for particular comparisons var-
ied slightly due to missing values in either the psychiatric
sample or in the matched sample.
Data Analysis
For each health item and for the composite measures, the
proportion of individuals in the psychiatric and general
population samples who met the criterion was compared
with a chi-square test, which is equivalent to testing for
a difference of proportions. We also computed 95% con-
fidence interval for the difference between the 2 groups.
To control error across multiple significance tests, we
controlled the ``false discovery'' rate at 0.05 (5%) using
a recently developed method.16
Within the psychiatric sample, bivariate analyses were
performed between each of the composite health status
measures in which more than 10% of the sample was cat-
egorized as healthy and demographic variables of age,
gender, education (high school graduate or not), race
(Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian), and diagnosis (schizo-
phrenia vs. mood disorder). A t-test was used for the

585
age variable to compare those who met the composite cri-
teria with those who did not, and continuity adjusted chi-
square analysis was used for the dichotomous variables.
We then performed logistic regression analyses on each
composite health status measure, including age and gen-
der and those variables that were significantly associated
with the dependent variable in bivariate analyses.
To quantify the association between health status items
within the group with serious mental illness, we calcu-
lated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals between
each unique pair of dichotomous health status items
and between the 2 composite indicators.
Results
Compared with the matched comparison group from the
general population, the sample of persons with serious
mental illness had a significantly lower proportion of
individuals who were nonsmokers, had teeth that were
in at least good condition, had a BMI that was in the non-
obese range, were free of injury in the past 90 days, and
did not have a serious medical comorbidity, as shown
in Table 1. The groups did not differ significantly in the
proportion that exercised at recommended levels. The
mentally ill and the general population group differed
significantly on the 3 composite health measures. A total
of 17% of the psychiatric sample, compared with 27% of
the matched general population sample, met criteria for
the composite of health behaviors (nonsmoker and exer-
cise that meets standards) (v2 [1 df] = 9.23, p = < .003);
11% versus 28% met criteria for the composite of health
outcomes (nonobesity, no co-occurring serious medical
disorder, and good dentition) (v2=25.03, p = <.0001)
and 1% versus 10% met criteria for the composite of
all 5 health items (v2 [1 df] = 15.26, p = <.0001).
With regard to the health behavior composite measure,
relatively more Caucasians (23 of 112) versus non-
Caucasians (8 of 88) and more persons with a mood dis-
order (22 of 100, 22%) versus schizophrenia (9/ of 100,
9%) were both nonsmokers and exercised at recommen-
ded levels within the psychiatric sample (v2 ([1 df] = 4.09,
p = .043; v2 [1 df] = 5.50, p = .02, respectively). Relatively
more persons who completed high school (30 of 145,
21%) versus those who did not complete high school
(1 of 54, 2%) also met the criteria for this composite mea-
sure (v2 [1 df] =9.23, p = .0024). Results of a logistic re-
gression analysis indicate that the education variable
remained significant when controlling for race and diag-
nosis along with age and gender (Wald v2 [1 df] = 6.60, p =
.01). None of the demographic variables were signifi-
cantly associated with the health outcomes composite
measure (BMI < 30, good dentition, and the absence

of a serious medical comorbidity). Bivariate analyses
were not performed between the overall health com-
posite measure and demographic variables because less
than 10% of the sample was categorized as healthy on
this measure.
As shown in Table 2, there was a significant association
between nonsmoking status and good dentition; persons
who were nonsmokers were almost twice as likely, in rel-
ative odds terms, to have good dentition as were smokers
(odds ratio = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.04, 3.32, p < .05). The ab-
sence of obesity was also positively associated with the
absence of a co-occurring serious medical illness; persons
who were not obese were more than twice as likely, in
relative odds terms, not to have a co-occurring medical
illness than those who were obese (odds ration = 2.27,
95% CI = 1.22, 4.22, p < .01). Good dentition was
also associated with the absence of a co-occurring med-
ical illness; persons with teeth in at least good condition
were almost 2 1/2 times as likely, in relative odds terms,
not to have a co-occurring medical illness than those with
fair or worse dentition (odds ratio = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.38,
4.50, p <.01). A significant inverse association was found
between the absence of obesity and nonsmoking; non-
smokers were only about half as likely, in relative odds
terms, to have a BMI in the nonobese range (odds ratio
= 0.55, 95% CI = 0.30, .997, p < .05) than were smokers.
None of the other associations between individual health
items was significant, as shown in Table 1, nor was the
association between the health behaviors and the health
outcomes composites (odds ratio = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.11,
2.21, n = 187).
Discussion
The relatively small proportion of persons with serious
mental illness from our sample that was categorized
as healthy on the individual health items and compos-
ite measures underscores the overall poor health status
of this group. Problems of smoking, obesity, and co-
occurring medical problems have been previously docu-
mented among persons with serious mental illness.1­4
Physical injuries have also been noted to be prevalent
among persons with serious mental illness and a cause
of excess mortality in this group.1,17,18 Our data do
not define the types of physical injury among persons
in our sample or how they relate to mortality risk;
these remain important topics for further investigation.
A very low percentage, 1%, of our psychiatric sample,
met the criteria for the composite measure of 5 health
items. Of note, while the comparison group from the gen-
eral population had a higher percentage that met this
composite's criteria, only a small minority, 10 %, were
categorized as healthy. These results are consistent
with 2 recent studies that assessed a composite of 4
healthy lifestyle factors among persons in the general
US population: BMI < 25; nonsmoker; consumption
of at least 5 fruits and vegetables daily; and moderate
or vigorous physical exercise. A strikingly low percentage
of persons in each study was adherent to all 4 indica-
tors: 3% in one7 and 6.8% in the other8 study. The health
items in these studies were similar to those that we
used, although our BMI cutoff of 30 was more liberal
and allowed persons who had a BMI of 25­29.9, in

Health Status of Individuals With Serious Mental Illness
the overweight range, to be categorized as healthy. Also,
we included items about co-occurring medical illnesses
and about dentition that the other studies did not. The
recent general population studies show a much lower
rate of smoking than found in our sample of persons
with mental illness; however, adherence to recommended
exercise is poor across all groups, and fewer than half of
the general population samples in these studies had
a body mass index that was in the healthy range.
Thus, it appears that the overall health of persons with
serious mental illness falls below an already suboptimal
level of overall health in the general population. The use
of composite indicators highlights the extent to which de-
viance from standards of health is a pervasive problem,
one that is amplified further among persons with serious
mental illness.
The reasons that persons with serious mental illness
have poorer health status than persons in the general
population are not known with certainty but likely in-
clude several interrelated factors. Psychotropic medica-
tions, such as some second-generation antipsychotic
agents, have been associated with weight gain, incident
diabetes, and other side effects that may adversely affect
health status.19 Psychiatric disorders themselves, apart
from medication treatment, may predispose individuals
to glucose intolerance20 and to cigarette smoking.21 In
addition, persons with serious mental illness often have
symptoms of depression and emotional withdrawal,
which may which contribute to their limited motivation
for positive health behaviors and attention to health
problems. Finally, the reduced socioeconomic status of
many persons with serious mental illness may reduce
their access to medical care and resources such as those
related to dental treatment and physical fitness.22,23
Within the psychiatric sample, we found that educa-
tional level was associated with the composite item mea-
suring health behaviors; significantly more high school
graduates than those who did not graduate from high
school were classified as healthy on this measure. Our
results are consistent with studies of persons in the pop-
ulation at large in which a higher educational level has
also been associated with lifestyle choices of not smoking
and of participating in exercise.7,24,25 Education was not
associated with the health outcomes composite, suggest-
ing some specificity to the impact of education on health
measures in this population.
Limitations of our study include the fact that our
sample was from only 1 geographic region, while the
NHANES III and NHIS comparison groups were nation-
wide. However, estimates of the prevalence of persons
who meet basic health indicators do not differ markedly
between individuals in Maryland and individuals nation-
wide, based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System.26 Another limitation of our study
was that it was based on self-report data. Also, we were
unable to include all health behaviors that are important
to overall health status, such as nutritional intake of
fruits and vegetables. At the current time, there is not
consensus about the items that should be in included in
a composite health measure. The components of such
a composite indicator may be interrelated, although the
extent of overlap is dependent on the specific factors
that are included. In studies of the general population,
the magnitude of the relationship among these factors
is not large,7 but this issue has not been systematically
investigated in previous studies of persons with serious
mental illness.
In our own sample we found that only 3 of 12 pairwise
associations between health status items were significant
and positive, indicating that individuals' health status on
different indicators is relatively independent. This finding
argues for examining multiple health indicators in order
to assess overall health status in persons with serious
mental illness, as has been studied in the general popula-
tion.7,8 An examination of multiple health indicators may
also lead to more accurate measures of overall health se-
verity in persons with mental illness. This issue is an ur-
gent one given the consistently higher rate of premature
death found among persons with serious mental illness,
a phenomenon that is likely related to a combination of
health risks.1 Measures that take into account multiple
indicators might also be used to calculate risk adjustment
for modeling health care costs in this population,
a method that has been used in non­mentally ill samples.9
Finally, a clinical approach that is focused on a combi-
nation of health indicators is consistent with a more
comprehensive strategy to promote better health among
persons with serious mental illness. Our results under-
score the need to improve health services and to develop
and finance services that promote health behaviors for
persons with serious mental illness.
