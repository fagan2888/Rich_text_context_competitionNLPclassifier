By using data from wave 2 (in 1996) and wave 3 (in 2000­2001) of the US-based National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health, we investigated the association between young women's body weight and depression during
the transition to adulthood. Respondents (n = 5,243) were 13­18 years of age during wave 2 and 19­25 years of
age during wave 3. We used Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores to classify young women
as never depressed, consistently depressed, experiencing depression onset, or experiencing depression recovery
from wave 2 to wave 3. Results from adjusted multinomial logistic regression models indicated that respondents
who experienced significant weight gain were at risk of depression onset. Normal weight (adjusted odds ratio =
2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.14, 3.84) and overweight (adjusted odds ratio = 1.86, 95% confidence interval:
1.15, 2.99) adolescent girls who were obese by young adulthood, as well as young women who were consistently
obese during adolescence and young adulthood (adjusted odds ratio = 1.97, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 3.26),
had roughly twice the odds of depression onset as did young women who were never overweight. We concluded
that weight gain and obesity are risk factors for depression onset during the transition to adulthood. Policies priori-
tizing healthy weight maintenance may help improve young women's mental health as they begin their adult lives.

Most adult mental health disorders first manifest during
adolescence and early adulthood, and nearly 75% of lifetime
diagnosable problems are evident by 24 years of age (1).
Depression, the most commonly reported adolescent mental
health disorder (2), is more prevalent in female than male
adolescents, and this gender difference persists into adult-
hood (3). Estimates of depression prevalence based on broad
assessment criteria indicating debilitating sadness suggest
that roughly one-third of all female US high school students
are depressed compared with one-fifth of male students (4).
Estimates based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders-IV are lower and suggest that 12% of
female and 5% of male adolescents are depressed (5).
Previous research has examined whether body weight is a
risk factor for depression among all adolescents and among
female adolescents in particular, because obesity is a stigma-
tized status that can lead to social isolation and discrimina-
tion (6, 7). These studies have produced mixed findings (8).
Among clinical adolescent samples, obesity is a risk factor
for depression (9­11). Among representative national and
community samples of adolescents, obesity is generally not
associated with depression (12, 13), especially in studies
that adjust estimates for confounders (14, 15). Even longitu-
dinal studies that examine how adolescent obesity at baseline
predicts depression 1 year later produce modest (16) or null
(12) findings.
Although representative studies have found little evidence
that obesity is a risk factor among all adolescents, this rela-
tionship has been found among national samples of younger
adolescents. Studies have found that, among students in 7th

and 8th grades, body mass index (BMI) (weight (kg)/height
(m)2) was associated with depression (17), and that, among
children aged 12­14 years, those who were classified as
obese or overweight according to age- and sex-specific
BMI percentiles were also at greater risk of depression (15).
Weight gain during pubertal development has also been
associated with depression among adolescent girls (18).
Although these subgroups are slightly different, they are all
samples of younger adolescents who are in the process of
transitioning from childhood to adolescence.
In sum, prior research suggests that weight is not a risk
factor for depression among all adolescents. Instead, it is a
risk factor during the transition into adolescence. Previous
studies have not examined whether weight is also associated
with depression as young people transition out of adoles-
cence, a life course stage commonly referred to as the "tran-
sition to adulthood" (19). During this time, young people
undergo many life changes, including high school exit and
entrance into the labor force or postsecondary educational
institutions (18). Young women are also more likely than
their male peers to exit parental residences, enter cohabiting
and marital unions, and become parents (20). Weight gain
and continued obesity in the midst of these transitions may
be particularly stigmatizing and distressing because these
life events place young women in new social settings and
networks at a time when social relationships undergo exten-
sive transformation (21). This leads us to hypothesize that
obesity and weight gain may be associated with depression
as young women transition to adulthood. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to assess whether weight and weight
change during the transition to adulthood influence the devel-
opment of, recovery from, and "consistent" depression mea-
sured at 2 distinct time points.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data for the study were drawn from the restricted-use ver-
sion of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(hereafter referred to as "Add Health"), a longitudinal,
nationally representative survey of students in the 7th­12th
grades from 134 schools (22). Respondents were selected
from a stratified random sample of students. Four waves of
in-home survey data were collected in 1995 (wave 1), 1996
(wave 2), 2000­2001 (wave 3), and 2008 (wave 4). The
response rate to the wave-1 survey was 79% (n = 20,745).
During wave 2, the 12th-grade students from wave 1 were
not followed up, and the response rate among followed-up
respondents was quite high (88.6%, n = 16,706). It remained
high in wave 3 (77.4%, n = 15, 197) and wave 4 (80.3%,
n = 15,701) (23). We analyzed data from survey participants
in waves 2 and 3 who were adolescents (aged 13­18 years) in
wave 2 and young adults (aged 19­25 years) in wave 3. We
used wave2 ratherthanwave1 tocaptureadolescence because
wave 2 included interviewer-measured assessments of res-
pondents' height and weight; wave 1 did not (data are self-
reported).
Of the 15,197 wave-3 respondents, 8,030 were young
women. We retained female respondents in the analysis if
they were 18 years of age in wave 2 (n = 7,061) and >18
years of age in wave 3 (n = 5,695). This ensured that we were
estimating associations between weight (and weight change)
and depression between adolescence and early adulthood.
This sample selection strategy has been used in a study that
uses Add Health data to estimate weight gain and stability
during the transition to adulthood (24). We excluded women
who were pregnant during either the wave-2 interview or the
wave-3 interview (n = 447) because their estimated weight
classifications while pregnant would be biased by pregnancy
weight gain, leading to potential misclassification of body
weight change during the transition to adulthood. The final
sample included 5,243 young women aged 13­18 years in
1996 and 19­25 years in 2000­2001.
Measures
Depression change. Waves 2 and 3 of the Add Health
included modified versions of the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (25). Wave 2 included a
19-item version of the instrument and wave 3 included a 9-
item version. Modified, shortened forms of the CES-D are
commonly used by researchers (26­28), and versions that use
as few as 4 items are reliable (27). Because we were inter-
ested in changes in symptomatology, we created comparable
indicators of depressive symptoms in waves 2 and 3 by
summing responses (ranging from 0 to 3) from the 9 CES-D
items found in both the wave-2 and wave-3 surveys. Items
asked respondents how often in the last week they were both-
ered by things not normally bothersome, could not shake the
blues, felt like they were not as good as others, had trouble
focusing, were depressed, were too tired to do things they
enjoyed, and were sad. Higher scores (range, 0­27) indicated
more depressive symptoms (in wave 2,  = 0.78; in wave
3,  = 0.80). Young women with scores of 11 or higher were
classified as depressed. Previous research that used the 9-item
scale has indicated that scores of this magnitude predict a
diagnostic definition of depression for female respondents
(29, 30). Other studies have used lower scores on the 9-item
scale to signify depression--either 10 or a score that was 1
standard deviation above the mean (15, 31, 32). We tested the
sensitivity of study results to these cutoffs, and results were
consistent across all of them.
Wave-2 and wave-3 depression indicators were used to
create a 4-category variable signifying depression during ado-
lescence and early adulthood. Respondents were classified
as never depressed (not depressed in either wave 2 or 3), con-
sistently depressed (depressed in both waves 2 and 3), recov-
ered from depression (depressed in wave 2 but not in wave
3), or as experiencing depression onset (depressed in wave 3
but not in wave 2). Category names are used for brevity
only; they are not clinical assessments, and these classifica-
tions capture depression at 2 time points only, not possible
bouts of depression or recovery between the survey waves.
Body weight change. Early adult BMI scores are based
on interviewer-measured height and weight data collected in
wave 3. We used calculated BMI scores to classify young
women as not overweight (BMI <25), overweight (BMI
25 to <30), or obese (BMI 30).
For adolescent subjects, we used wave-2 height and weight
data to calculate age- and sex-specific BMI percentiles
according to guidelines of the US Centers for Disease Control
Weight and Depression in the Transition to Adulthood 23
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;178(1):22­30
and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia). We then classified young
women as not overweight, overweight, or obese by using
guidelines of the International Obesity Taskforce (London,
United Kingdom) for matching adolescent BMI percentiles
to adult BMI scores. After this conversion, we classified ado-
lescents as not overweight, overweight, or obese by using
the guidelines foradults (33). This approach accounted for the
discrepancy in assessments of overweight and obesity for
adolescents and adults and has been used in prior studies
that examined weight gain during the transition to adulthood
(24). Results from supplementary analyses that did not trans-
form adolescent BMI percentiles to adult BMI scores before
classifying respondents into weight categories are consistent
with the results presented here.
We used adolescent and early adult weight categories to
classify young women as never overweight (referent), con-
sistently overweight, consistently obese, or as weight losers
or weight gainers. Weight gainers were further decomposed
into categories indicating a transition from normal weight to
overweight, from normal weight to obese, or from overweight
to obese. Weight losers were not decomposed because few
sample members (3.7%) lost weight.
Covariates. Several variables were treated as confound-
ers because of their relationships with body weight and depres-
sion. These included race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, and "other" vs. the referent, non-Hispanic white);
nativity; age; total family income; parents' highest level of
education measured as a continuous variable ranging from 1
(no formal schooling) to 8 (graduate/professional school);
family structure (living in single-parent, step-parent, or other
type of household vs. living in a household with 2 biological/
adoptive parents); fair/poor self-reported health; physical
activity (i.e., frequency of activities such as jogging, walking,
and dancing in the past week); and whether women were ever
pregnant prior to wave 2 or between waves 2 and 3. All covar-
iates were constructed by using wave-2 data except for family
income, which was assessed at wave 1 only, and pregnancy
data, which were retrospectively reported by women.
Data analysis
All variables had missing data for 5% or fewer cases, with
the exception of family income (22% of cases). When omit-
ting cases with missing data on any variable, we lost roughly
30% of the sample, and the retained sample was not repre-
sentative of the Add Health's wave-3 female respondents on
key variables, including depression and weight gain.
The use of multiple imputation to handle missing data is
more efficient and less biased than the use of listwise dele-
tion (34). Given the sample selection bias that listwise dele-
tion produced, we multiply imputed missing data by using
the imputation for changed equations (ICE) procedure for
Stata, version 12.0, software (StataCorp LP, College Station,
Texas). The procedure iteratively replaces missing values on
all variables with predictions based on random draws from
the posterior distributions of parameters observed in the sam-
ple, creating multiple complete data sets (35). We averaged
empirical results across 5 imputation samples and accounted
for random variation across samples to calculate standard
errors (36). In supplementary analysis, we estimated statisti-
cal models on the sample observed after listwise deletion of
missing data. Results were similar to those shown here, but
estimates here are slightly more conservative. These results
also better represent the national sample of female Add Health
participants.
All statistical analyses were conducted by using Stata,
version 12.0, software (StataCorp LP). Survey commands
were used to weight estimates and to account for the Add
Health survey design. We first calculated weighted means
and proportions for study variables to show characteristics
of the total sample and of young women in different weight
categories (Table 1). We then used multinomial logistic-
regression models to estimate unadjusted odds ratios, adjusted
odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals that show how
weight change is related to changes in depression between
adolescence and early adulthood (Table 2).
RESULTS
Table 1 describes the study sample's characteristics. Most
young women were never depressed during the transition to
adulthood (77.6%). Among young women with some
depression incidence, 4.2% were depressed during adoles-
cence and early adulthood, 11.1% recovered from depres-
sion by early adulthood, and 7.0% experienced depression
onset by early adulthood. With respect to weight change,
51.4% of the sample was never overweight. Another 20%
was not overweight during adolescence, but three-quarters
of these young women were overweight by early adulthood
and the other 25% were obese. Consistently overweight young
women represented 6.2% of the sample, and 8.9% of young
women transitioned from overweight to obese. Nearly 10%
of young women were obese during adolescence and early
adulthood. The smallest proportion of young women included
those who lost enough weight to be classified into a lower
BMI category (3.7%). Sociodemographic characteristics of
the sample show that 68.5% of the included subjects were
non-Hispanic white, 94.3% were US natives, 57.3% lived
with both parents during adolescence, the average level of
parental education was slightly more than high school, and
families' average yearly income in 1994­1995 was $46,600.
Only 7% of young women reported fair/poor health. On
average, young women reported participating in physical
activities infrequently (1.7 times per week), and 30% reported
at least 1 pregnancy between waves 2 and 3 or prior to
wave 2.
Young women's characteristics varied across weight cate-
gories. With respect to depression, a greater proportion of
young women who were never overweight (80.0%), consis-
tently overweight (80.6%), and classified as weight losers
(81%) were never depressed compared with peers who were
obese during adolescence and early adulthood (70.0%) and
those who became obese by early adulthood (72.2% of those
who were not overweight during adolescence and 70.6% of
those who were overweight). Consistent depression during
the transition to adulthood was most common among consis-
tently obese young women (7.1%) and least common among
those who were never overweight (3.5%). Consistently obese
young women (10.2%) and those who became obese (11.5%

of those who were not overweight during adolescence and
9.8% of those who were overweight) had the highest prevalence
of depression onset by early adulthood. Surprisingly, depres-
sion recovery was most common among young women who
were overweight as adolescents and obese as young adults
(14.8%). Young women in different weight categories also
had disparate background characteristics. For example, black
and Hispanic young women were disproportionately under-
represented among the subsample that was never overweight.
Young women reporting fair/poor health were dispropor-
tionately overrepresented among consistently obese sample
members.
Table 2 shows results that were obtained from multinomial
logistic regression models that estimated depression change
during the transition to adulthood. "Never depressed" was the
reference category. The first set of models shows how weight
change was associated with depression recovery. The second
set shows how weight change was associated with depression
onset. The final set shows how weight change was related to
consistent depression. "Never overweight" was the reference
category for weight change.
Results from models estimating depression recovery indi-
cated that girls who transitioned from overweight to obese
were more likely than peers who were never overweight
to recover from depression by early adulthood. When odds
ratios were adjusted for young women's sociodemographic
backgrounds, this estimated association was no longer statis-
tically significant (adjusted odds ratio = 1.34, 95% confi-
dence interval: 0.90, 2.00).
Odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios from models estimat-
ing depression onset indicated that consistently obese young
women and those who became obese during the transition to
adulthood had higher odds of depression onset than did their
peers who were never overweight. Consistently obese young
women (adjusted odds ratio = 1.97, 95% confidence interval:
1.19, 3.26) and both normal weight (adjusted odds ratio =
2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.14, 3.84) and overweight
(adjusted odds ratio = 1.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.15,
2.99) adolescent girls who became obese all had roughly
twice the odds of depression onset.
The final set of models showed that consistent obesity
more than doubled the odds of consistent depression when
results were unadjusted (odds ratio = 2.31, 95% confidence
interval: 1.32, 4.05). After adjustment for young women's
background characteristics, the association was reduced and
was not statistically significant. Supplementary analyses indi-
cated that self-rated health explains the estimated association
between consistent obesity and consistent depression, sug-
gesting that the poor physical health of consistently obese
young women explained their elevated risk of depression
during the transition to adulthood.
We conducted supplementary analyses to further assess
the meaning and robustness of these findings. These analy-
ses showed that the relationships between weight change
and depression change described above are unique to young
women. Multinomial logistic regression models showed no
significant relationship between weight change and depres-
sion change among young men. Supplementary analyses also
suggested that study results were unique to the transition to
adulthood. We replicated the analyses presented here by using

data from waves 3 and 4 of the Add Health when sample
members were adults aged 19­25 years and 25­31 years,
respectively. Neither weight gain nor obesity predicted depres-
sion consistency, recovery, or onset between survey waves.
We also tested whether results were robust to the inclusion of
stress-related confounders in statistical models. Addition of
either a binary measure of experiencing a stressful life event
or a count of such events to the models did not statistically or
substantively change the estimated associations shown in
model 2 (Table 2). Finally, to test whether results were driven
by reverse causation (with depression causing weight gain),
we conducted supplementary analyses testing whether wave-2
depression predicted weight change. It did not, regardless of
whether we operationalized weight change by using the cate-
gories we used here or a difference score between BMI in
waves 2 and 3.
DISCUSSION
Our findings showed that weight change was related to
depression during the transition to adulthood. Young women
who became obese and those who were consistently obese
had roughly double the odds of depression onset during
early adulthood as did their peers who were never over-
weight. Although this is the first study to focus on weight
change and depression during the transition to adulthood,
the findings are in line with those of previous studies of weight
and depression among young people. Analyses of nationally
representative and community data have consistently found no
association between obesity and depression during the adoles-
cent years as a whole (12­16). Instead, obesity and weight
gain are related to depression as children transition into ado-
lescence regardless of whether this transition is defined by
pubertal development (18) or entry into the teen years (ages
12­14 years) (15, 17). Together, these findings suggest that
weight gain is especially salient for depression during major
life-course transitions.
Supplementary analyses showing that weight gain and
consistent obesity are not associated with depression onset
during adulthood offer furtherevidence that obesity is not uni-
formly consequential for depression across the life course.
These findings highlight the need to heed recent calls for
health researchers to use a life-course framework (37). Failing
to do so may lead researchers and practitioners to overlook
key moments in time when intervention strategies are needed
most.
Our findings also showed that consistent obesity was asso-
ciated with consistent depression, but this association was
explained by fair/poor self-assessed health during adoles-
cence. These findings dovetail with previous research showing
that obese adolescents have lower health-related quality of
life (38) and poorer self-assessed health (15) than do their
normal-weight counterparts.
Our findings also reveal that weight gain is a significant
public health concern in the transition to adulthood. We
found that 9.8% of young women were consistently obese
during adolescence and early adulthood, and 13.8% of young
women became obese by early adulthood. This is consistent
with previous research examining weight change during the
transition to adulthood (24). Our study's major contribution is
documenting that this physical health risk also jeopardizes
mental well-being during a life-course stage when depression
onset is common (1).
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the
relationship between weight change and depression during
the transition to adulthood. It has several strengths. Data for
the study were drawn from a nationally representative, longi-
tudinal US sample of young people followed from adoles-
cence through early adulthood. Studies of physical and mental
health during the transition to adulthood are also important
because this life-course stage marks a time when young
people experience transitions that can reshape their physical
health, mental health, and, as our study shows, the relationship
between the 2. Finally, the BMI categories we used were
based on interviewer-assessed height and weight data. These
data are often self-reported in large population-representative
samples.
The study also has limitations. We operationalized depres-
sion by using the CES-D. This instrument is often used in
epidemiologic studies (39­41), but it is not a diagnostic
tool. Accordingly, results reflect depression as indicated by
self-reported symptomology rather than by clinical diagno-
sis. In addition, weight and depression were measured at
only 2 time points. Given that depression is largely episodic,
our indicator of depression change was somewhat limited.
BMI scores and categories also have strengths (e.g., the indi-
cators of height and weight that are used to create them are low
cost and easily measured in large, population-representative
studies) but also limitations for capturing body fatness (42).
In addition, we could not measure all possible confounders
of the relationships this study identifies, as is often the case
when analyzing secondary data. Stress is an obvious example.
Although we included a measure of stressful life events in
supplementary models, it was a fairly limited measure that
could not fully capture the stress universe.
Future research should examine what roles stress and
social support have in relationships between weight change
and depression change. Both may be important mechanisms.
Prior research has shown that social support helps over-
weight and obese women cope with the stress of weight
stigma (43). As young women take on new social roles and
are thrust into new social settings and networks during the
transition to adulthood (19­21), they may face increased
weight stigma, increased stress, and reduced social support,
thus increasing their odds of becoming depressed. Nearly 1
in 4 US adolescent girls becomes or remains obese by early
adulthood, making it critical to understand how stress, social
support, and other possible mechanisms explain why these
young women are at risk of depression onset during the tran-
sition to adulthood.
