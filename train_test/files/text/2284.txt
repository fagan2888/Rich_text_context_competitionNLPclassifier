ABSTRACT
Objective To provide an accurate estimate of violent war
deaths.
Design Analysis of survey data on mortality, adjusted for
sampling bias and censoring, from nationally
representative surveys designed to measure population
health. Estimated deaths compared with estimates in
database of passive reports.
Setting 2002-3 World health surveys, in which
information was collected from one respondent per
household about sibling deaths, including whether such
deaths resulted from war injuries.
Main outcome measure Estimated deaths from war
injuries in 13 countries over 50 years.
ResultsFrom1955to2002,datafromthesurveysindicated
an estimated 5.4 million violent war deaths (95%
confidence interval 3.0 to 8.7 million) in 13 countries,
ranging from 7000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo to
3.8 million in Vietnam. From 1995 to 2002 survey data
indicate 36000 war deaths annually (16000 to 71000) in
the 13 countries studied. Data from passive surveillance,
however, indicated a figure of only a third of this. On the
basis of the relation between world health survey data and
passive reports, we estimate 378000 global war deaths
annually from 1985-94, the last years for which complete
passive surveillance data were available.
Conclusions The use of data on sibling history from
peacetime population surveys can retrospectively
estimatemortalityfromwar. Warcausesmoredeathsthan
previously estimated, and there is no evidence to support
a recent decline in war deaths.
INTRODUCTION
Estimating mortality due to war is notoriously difficult,
but the importance of war as a public health problem as
wellasasocialproblemmakesitimperativetoimprove
on existing methods of measurement. Accurate esti-
mates of the numbers of deaths are crucial for political,
military, and public health planning, as well as for
purposes of national history and reconciliation.
The challenges to estimating war mortality are
considerable. Civil registration systems that track
deaths in peacetime typically fall apart during war,
and many wars occur in places without pre-existing
surveillance infrastructure. In the absence of reliable
data from representative national information systems,
three main techniques are currently used to generate
estimates.
Existing techniques
Firstly, a few surveys have been undertaken during
wars in specific countries to estimate mortality on the
basis of household deaths.1-10 These surveys have
produced timely estimates, despite the usual problems
of estimating adult mortality from surveys11 and the
additional logistical challenges posed by ongoing
warfare. The politicised environment surrounding the
Iraq mortality studies in particular, however, has
generated considerable debate regarding the statistical
validity of such studies. The small number of clusters
often necessitated by active combat can lead to high
levels of uncertainty.12 13 Other researchers draw
attention to the difficulties of extrapolating from
small sample populations to the national level14 15 or
to the difficulty of constructing a valid counterfactual
for estimates of excess mortality.16 Some of the most
serious criticisms allege systematic bias resulting from
sampling methods17 or politically motivated over-
reporting of deaths12 16 18 19--for example of non-house-
hold members.20 Whatever their merits, these critiques
have taken on considerable importance in the public
and scientific discourse surrounding estimates of
mortality.
Secondly, some studies have attempted to calculate
mortality from censuses using demographic techni-
ques that compare the age distribution of a population
before and after war.21-24 Reliable census data, how-
ever, are seldom available at these times and so strong
assumptions are required to project existing data
forward and backward. In addition, census based
methods do not produce accurate estimates for
populations with high migration, as occurs during
war.25
Thirdly, several passive surveillance methods use
information from eyewitness and media reports or
statistics from mortuaries, gravesites, and health
facilities. In the absence of population based data
these data are typically the only ones available during
ongoing conflicts and represent the most commonly
cited sources for government and other estimates of

war casualties, as in the current war in Iraq.26 27 In some
post-conflict settings, including war crimes inquiries,
active investigations have been undertaken to compile
all available evidence from such sources and to
supplement them further with intelligence reports,
incomplete civil registration records, and missing
persons lists.28-30
Passive reports
Passively reported data are subject to several biases.
High levels of war related mortality occur in those
violent and dangerous areas where eyewitnesses are
least likely to go, resulting in systematic under-
reporting of deaths by media sources.1-28 31 A similar
biasislikely toaffectstatisticsfrommortuariesorhealth
facilities,32 as well as partial civil registration records
from those regions where government infrastructure
remains intact. Media and eyewitness reports, and to a
lesser degree facility records, are also subject to
political pressures, which can result in either exaggera-
tion or under-reporting of deaths. Such reports,
however, represent the only source of information on
deaths for the vast majority of conflicts, and passive
data collection has formed the basis for most efforts to
date to analyse global trends in war mortality. A
collaboration between Uppsala University and the
Peace Research Institute, Oslo, has produced a
database(Uppsala/PRIO)thatcompilesandreconciles
passivereportsonviolentdeathsrelatedtowarglobally
from 1900 onward. This database is considered to be
more consistent and comparable than other efforts.33
The data suggest that violent deaths from war have
declined steadily since the second world war and that
recentyears have been someof the most peaceful of the
past century.34 This claim lends empirical support to
recent research suggesting that overall levels of violent
conflict are falling globally35-38 and to the view that
warfare has become less deadly in recent years thanks
to technological innovations and strategic priorities
designed to minimise civilian deaths.37 39
Given the paucity of population surveys and the
known biases in passively reported data, we propose a
new approach to estimate violent war deaths, using
data on sibling history from household surveys
conducted in peacetime and adjusting for known
biases. Using nationally representative data from the
World Health Organization's 2002-3 world health
survey (WHS) programme, we produced estimates of
such deaths in 13 countries over the past 50 years. This
retrospective method, which is free from the logistical
constraints imposed by active combat, is meant to
augment and complement information from wartime
survey efforts in three ways. Firstly, sample sizes are
typically considerably greater and sampling more
systematic than during active combat. Secondly,
using siblings' histories rather than household deaths

exaggeration of deaths. Finally, we corrected for
known problems with mortality surveys--namely,
under-representation of families with high mortality
and censoring. Such retrospective population based
methods can provide accurate data on war deaths,
which are crucial for understanding historical trends as
well as for future planning.
METHODS
The world health surveys were carried out in 2002-3 in
70 countries. These nationally representative surveys,
which have been described in detail elsewhere,40 were
designed to measure various dimensions of population
health and performance of health systems. Surveys in
45 countriescollected information on adult deaths,
including specific questions about the survival of
siblings of the respondent, a randomly selected house-
hold member. For siblings who died from injuries,
information was collected on the cause of death,
including whether the injury was related to war. Of
the 45 surveys with data on sibling history, 13 were
found to have more than five reported sibling deaths
from war injuries in a given 10 year period, and we
focused on these countries in the analysis. Table 1
shows selected survey characteristics for the 13 surveys
used.
We estimated numbers of violent war deaths by
performing a proportional mortality analysis. We

estimated the fraction of total deaths due to war injuries
in a given time period based on the survey data and
applied this fraction to UN Population Division
estimates of total deaths available for all countries
from 1955 onward.41
We divided the periodfrom 1955 to 2002 into blocks
of10years;1955isthefirstyearforwhichUNestimates
of total deaths are available, and we chose intervals of
10 years to minimise the effect of random error and age
heaping in reported ages and years. The last period
(1995-2002) is shorter because the survey began in
2002. Across all surveys, information regarding cause
of death was missing for 17% of deaths; we conserva-
tively assumed these to be not related to war. Year of
birth for respondents was assigned based on reported
age or year of birth. Year of birth for siblings was
assigned based either on the reported age difference
between the respondent and each sibling or the
sibling's reported year of birth. For siblings for whom
information on year of birth was missing, we imputed it
by randomly drawing a sibling-respondent age differ-
ence from a normal distribution with mean and
standard deviation based on individual country data
from the relevant survey. Overall, year of birth was
based on reported age for 83% of siblings and on
reported year of birth for 16% and was imputed for 1%.
We based year of death on either the respondent's
report of how long ago the death occurred or how old
the sibling was when he or she died. Information on
year of death was missing for 25% of non-war deaths
and 12% of war deaths. Given the significant difference
in these proportions (t test, P<0.001), we probabilisti-
cally imputed a year of death to avoid upward bias.
Overall, we calculated year of death on the reported
number of years since the death for 70% of deaths and
on the sibling's reported age at death for 5% and
imputed it for 25% of deaths.
To calculate probabilities of death for all causes and
for war, we divided the number of deaths by the
number of siblings alive in a given 10 year block, after
applying two corrections. Firstly, to correct for the fact
that families with high rates of mortality are under-
represented in surveys, we weighted siblings by Bf
/Sf
,
where Bf
is the original sibship size and Sf
is the number
of siblings alive at the time of the survey, according to
the method developed by Gakidou and King.42
Secondly, we corrected for left and right censoring
that occurred in our data because of the limits of
respondents' age. Sibling deaths at older ages are less
likelytobereportedforyearslongerago:toconsideran
extreme example, to report on the death of an 80 year
old sibling 80 years ago, a respondent would have to be
on average 160 years old. Likewise, adult respondents
are less likely to have very young siblings (such as
infants) on whom to report deaths in recent time
periods. To correct for this censoring, we applied a
regression model separately to probability of death in
warandnotinwar.Weexponentiatedthecorrectedlog
probability of death from the war and non-war models
and took the ratio of war to all cause probability to
calculate the fraction of war deaths by age group,

country, and year. We standardised using the WHO
standard population43 and applied the calculated
fraction of war deaths to estimates of total deaths by
country and year. We captured uncertainty by
simulating 1000 simultaneous draws from the var-
iance-covariance matrix of both war and non-war
models to arrive at 1000 estimates of the percentage
deaths related to war; the 25th and 976th ranked
estimates define the 95% uncertainty interval.44
Finally, we compared our estimates with those from
the Uppsala/PRIO database using a linear model, with
survey estimated war deaths from 1955-2002 as the
dependent variable and Uppsala/PRIO war deaths
from the same period as the independent variable. We
used the relation derived from this model to adjust the
global historical trend observed in the Uppsala/PRIO
data. (A technical appendix with more details on the
methods is available at http://healthmetricsandevalua
tion.org/resources/pubs.html.)
RESULTS
A total of 43 874 sibling deaths were reported in the 13
surveys, of which 917 were a result of war injuries.
Some 38 613 deaths, of which 797 were due to war,
occurred after 1955 and were eligible to be included in
our analysis. Figure 1 shows the age and sex distribu-
tion of all violent war deaths captured in 13 countries
from 1955 to 2002. Among war deaths, 58% were in
people aged 15 to 34 and 81% were in males.
Table 2 presentstotalsurveyestimatesofviolentwar
deaths by 10 year intervals. Our analysis indicates that
there were 36 000 war deaths annually from 1995 to
2002 in these countries (95% confidence interval
16 000 to 71 000). The time period with the highest
war deaths was 1965-74, with 205 000 deaths a year,
largely attributable to the Vietnam war.
Table 3 shows the total number of deaths by country
from 1955-2002 estimated from the surveys, alongside
data from Uppsala/PRIO. Survey estimates indicate
that a total of 5.4 million (3.0 to 8.7 million) violent war
deaths occurred from 1955 to 2002 in 13 countries,
ranging from 7000 in the Republic of Congo to 3.8
million in Vietnam. The average ratio of survey
estimates to Uppsala/PRIO data is 3, implying that
media estimates capture on average a third of the
number of deaths estimated from population based
surveys. The largest differences were in Bangladesh,
Georgia, and Zimbabwe. Apart from Georgia, where
the absolute numbers were small, the difference
between the two sources was most pronounced in
Bangladesh, where the survey shows 269 000 deaths
compared with 58 000 in the Uppsala/PRIO database
during the conflict leading to that country's indepen-
dence, and in Zimbabwe, where the survey estimates
nearly130 000deathscomparedwithUppsala/PRIO's
28 000. The two estimates are closest in Congo-
Brazzaville (7000 in the world health survey and
10 000 in Uppsala/PRIO) and Burma (also known as
Myanmar) (31 000 and 37 000, respectively). Uppsala/
PRIO provides only limited information on
uncertainty, in the form of a low to high range; this is
presented where available.
The rank order correlation coefficient between the
two sets of estimates is 0.57, which indicates consider-
able discrepancy between the two sources on the
relative size of the conflicts. Both sources agree that,
among these countries, Vietnam and Ethiopia had the
greatest number of deaths. Figure 2 presents deaths per
year in Vietnam, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, and Bosnia from
the world health survey and Uppsala/PRIO. The
survey estimates are consistently higher, except during
the period1965-74 inVietnam, when the two estimates
are not significantly different; this 10 year period was
the interval with the most estimated war deaths of all
the time periods studied in this analysis. Figure 3
presents survey estimates alongside Uppsala/PRIO
data for total yearly deaths across all 13 survey
countries combined. Although the levels of deaths

estimates lie above the equivalence line shows that

estimates shown in figure 5. The period 1985-94 is
the lastfull intervalfor whichUppsala/PRIOdatawere

the adjusted number of deaths was greater than the
reported number in all time periods, with a threefold
difference in the most recent period. The adjusted

period of the Vietnam war.
DISCUSSION
Household surveys can be used to retrospectively
estimate war deaths over time. The localisation in time
of deaths captured by the world health survey is largely
consistent with patterns described in qualitative
historical accounts. The survey captured a total of
290war deaths in Vietnam, of which 155 were reported
between 1965 and 1975, the period widely considered
to be the most deadly phase of the war.45 Similarly, in
Ethiopia the highest level of war deaths is estimated to
be between 1975and 1984, aperiodbeginningwith the
deposition of Haile Selassie by the Derg and followed
by open war in Somalia and Eritrea and the so called
"red terror" when many civilians are thought to have
beenkilled.Approximatetimelocalisationofdeathsby
survey respondents seems to remain intact for long
periods: the survey in Paraguay, for example, captured
62 deaths between 1925 and 1934, of which eight were
war deaths, coincident with the Chaco war between
Paraguay and Bolivia. We could not apply our method
to estimate war deaths in this war only because UN
estimates of total deaths by country are unavailable
before 1955. The fact that respondents in certain
household surveys are able to localise the time of the
death of their sibling as far back as six decades is
remarkable, but it is important to note that the ability to
do so is likely to vary by country. Little empirical
information about recall bias exists in general because
of the lack of an ideal standard by which to judge its
degree and determinants (though research on this topic
is ongoing46). The salience of the WHO survey data,
however, mightindicate thatwar deaths areless subject
to recall bias than other deaths, perhaps because of the
young age of victims and strong emotional associations
for family members.
Our analysis also suggests that war kills many more
people than previously estimated. Data from the
Uppsala/PRIO database indicate that an average of
137 000 died globally each year between 1985 and
1994, while we estimate a figure of nearly 378 000 over
the same period. In addition to the absolute number of
deaths,comparisonofthepatternofdeathsovertimein
survey estimates might lead to different conclusions
about trends compared with data from media reports,
both at country level and globally. Survey estimates
from Sri Lanka suggest a consistent decline in deaths
since1975,whiletheUppsala/PRIOestimatesshowan
increase starting in 1985-94. In Ethiopia on the other
hand, survey estimates indicate that deaths declined far
more slowly than media reports indicate. Our adjust-
ments to the Uppsala/PRIO data likewise do not
support the claim that war deaths are declining
globally. Overall, nationally representative surveys
yield estimates of war deaths that are less optimistic
than those based on passive surveillance, implying that
itwouldrarelybeappropriateto takesuchdataasatrue
reflection of the magnitude or trend of deaths.
These findings suggest that the strong claims made
on the basis of current data from media reports--
namely, that the number of deaths related to war has
declined consistently since the mid-20th century and
that recent wars have killed relatively few people--
shouldbere-evaluated.Ouranalysissuggestsamethod
for adjustment of passive surveillance data, which
might be the only option when other data are not
available.Suchapproximatemethods,however,areno
substitute for real data as the adjusted uncertainty
intervals are large, even without taking into account
uncertaintyinthepointestimatesonwhichthemodelis
based. More resources are urgently needed for
empirical measurement of war deaths.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations that might influence
the interpretation of our results. Firstly, as the survey
instrument collects information on deaths from war
injuries, our estimates capture only direct violent
deaths from war, not all excess deaths attributable to
war. Previous studies have shown that while in some
countries most war deaths result from such direct
injuries,1 6 7 in other settings, such as those with less
developed health infrastructure or worse overall
health, violent deaths represent only a small fraction
of total excess mortality.2 Secondly, there are several
potential sources of bias in survey data. Recall bias
might have resulted in an underestimate of war deaths
as deaths that happened longer ago might be less likely
to be reported, particularly in younger age groups. We
address this by using corrected probabilities of death
from the statistical model, but it is possible that our
correction is insufficient.
The inability of surveys to capture families with no
survivors is another source of downward bias; while
simulation evidence suggests that these families
account for only a small proportion of all mortality,42
this problem is likely to be more acute in war settings
than in other high mortality settings. Overall, we think
that the estimates presented here should be viewed as
conservative, given these sources of downward bias.

Results could also be biased upwards if deaths related
towararereportedmorefrequentlyormoreaccurately
than otherdeaths. The survey instrument was designed
to minimise this error by asking respondents to
enumerate all their siblings (both alive and dead)
before answering specific questions about siblings who
died. Imputation of missing year of death also corrects
for poorer reporting of the timing of non-war deaths.
Thirdly, as the survey was not specifically designed
to measure war deaths, the absolute number of sibling
deaths captured is small, leading to considerable
uncertainty around our point estimates of war deaths
--this might be a consistent feature of any survey based
estimate of adult mortality, particularly cause specific
estimates like our study and previous studies of war
mortality. Additional uncertainty might have been
introducedintoourresultsbyusingtheUNestimatesof
total deaths; however, these numbers are the only
available source of information on mortality level for
these country periods. Fourthly, we restricted our
estimatestocountryperiodswithmorethanfivesibling
war deaths to reduce uncertainty; doing so, however,
might have excluded information from small conflicts,
which account for less than 1% of all deaths.
Finally, the absence of an ideal standard measure-
ment of war mortality--which is the reason that
alternative techniques such as surveys are needed--
prevents us from validating our estimates with respect
to true numbers. In the absence of credible vital
registration data during wartime, the prospect of a
validation study against a standard dataset is unlikely.
We were unable to locate estimates of deaths from
wartime surveys with which to compare our estimates
in the 13 countries studied; nor to our knowledge are
any future surveys planned in these countries, which
could have served to check the consistency of the
estimates.
Comparisons with other sources
One source of comparison in Vietnam is an analysis of
that country's life history survey, which yielded an
estimate of 966 000 war deaths between 1965 and
1975,47 considerably lower than the world health
survey estimate (1.7 million). The authors acknowl-
edge, however, that the Vietnam life history survey
results are biased downwards because rural areas with
highermortalitywereunder-representedandestimates
were not corrected for under-representation of high
mortality families. In addition, the small sample (403
households compared with 4089 in the world health
surveys) might have missed clusters of high mortality
areas.
Another comparison can be made between survey
data and the estimate of 97 000 dead and missing in
Bosnia in 1991-5 by the Research and Documentation
CentreinSarajevo,48 whichhascompiledahighquality
database of records, testimonies, and eyewitness and
historical reports.49 As with similar efforts in Iraq,27
reported data provide a useful minimum estimate of
deaths: our estimate of 167 000 deaths is higher than
the centre's figure but still considerably lower than
other estimates, which have ranged up to 329 000.30
The centre's database also permits comparison of time
trends, which indicate that most deaths occurred from
1992to1994.Thegeneraltrendinbothsetsofnumbers
is similar, with a decrease in deaths in 1995-2002
relative to 1985-94, corresponding to the final year of
the war.
As a final point of comparison, we applied our
correction method, derived from the comparison of
survey estimates with Uppsala/PRIO data, to data
from the Iraq Body Count project's most recent report
of 86 539 (the midpoint of the 82 772 to 90 305 range
reported in April 2008) dead in Iraq since 2003.27 Our
adjusted estimate of 184 000 violent deaths related to
war falls between the Iraq Family Health Survey
estimate of 151 000 (104 000 to 223 000)9 and the
601 000estimatefromthesecondIraqmortalitysurvey
by Burnham and colleagues.1
Conclusions
Large scale population based surveys conducted in
peacetime, despite their limitations, hold promise for
measurementofwarmortalityforatleastthreereasons.
Firstly, these surveys have several attributes (such as
small sampling units, large numbers of clusters,
stratification, random selection of households within
clusters50) that are better suited to producing estimates
of violent deaths--which tend to be geographically
clustered--than those typically available during active
humanitarian emergencies.51 Future surveys could
reduce uncertainty around estimates from sibling
historiesbyseveraltechniques,includinglargersample
sizes, multiple non-sibling respondents per household,
and more structured sibling histories. The survey
performedwellinthesettingofsomeongoingconflicts,
such as Ethiopia and Sri Lanka, each gathering data on
around 30 000 siblings with low non-response rates; it
is clear, however, that the questionnaire and study
design would need to be modified for use during high
intensity conflicts. Secondly, household surveys in

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Population based estimates of violent war deaths for 13 countries from 1955-2002, including
Vietnam, Bosnia, and Ethiopia, are considerably higher than most previous estimates
In these 13 countries, media reports captured only about a third of all deaths estimated from
population based surveys
The new method of adjusting numbers reported in the media yields a more realistic global
estimate of the number of violent war deaths per year

peacetime can be implemented quickly and relatively
inexpensively. Finally, as population health surveys
are not specifically designed to measure war mortality,
and as respondents are asked to provide complete
informationonalloftheirsiblingsbeforesurvivalstatus
and cause of death are ascertained, there is less scope
for exaggeration or double counting of deaths. In
addition, such surveys can also provide information on
causes of adult mortality other than war: recent
advances in verbal autopsy techniques52-56 show
promise for overcoming the many well known limita-
tions of such cause of death data.
Accurate estimates of war mortality are crucial for
planning on several different levels. Political, military,
and public health leaders must have credible informa-
tion on the number of deaths to plan properly before,
during,andafterwars.Thepublicmustalsobeawareof
the human cost of wars. Information on war deaths is
useful in the investigation of the scope of war crimes, as
in the Nuremburg Trials after the second world war or
the international criminal tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia.30 57 Finally, an accurate count of the
number of deaths in war is an important part of a
nation's history. The South African Truth and Recon-
ciliation Commission is only one example of how a
frank accounting of past tragedies is helping to make
future ones less likely.
