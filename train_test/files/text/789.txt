Reliability of Alcohol Intake as Recalled from 10 Years in the Past
Simin Liu,12'3 Mary K. Serdula,1 Tim Byers^David F. Williamson,1 Ali H. Mokdad,1 and W. Dana Flanders4
The authors assessed the reliability of alcohol intake as recalled from 10 years in the past in a cohort of
2,907 US adults. Participants reported their drinking habits in the First National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey interview during 1971-1975. During a follow-up interview in 1982-1984, they were asked to
recall their drinking habits 10 years earlier and to report their current habits. In general, the correlation for
recalled alcohol intake versus reported intake at baseline was good (r = 0.7). For all subgroups stratified by
race, sex, education, smoking status, and disease status, the age-adjusted correlations for recalled alcohol
intake versus baseline intake were equal to or higher than those for current alcohol intake versus baseline
intake. The reliability of recall of alcohol intake in the past differs among subgroups with different age and
education levels. Recalled alcohol intake was also highly correlated with current alcohol intake; in particular,
current heavier drinkers tended to underestimate their previous amount of drinking, an effect that was
independent of other factors. These data suggest that although recalled alcohol intake is a better predictor of
past intake than are reports of current intake, current drinking habits may be an important influencing factor
in the estimation of alcohol intake as recalled from the distant past. Am J Epidemiol 1996;143:177-86.
alcoholic beverages; bias (epidemiology); recall
Alcohol intake has been intensely studied as a risk
factor for many chronic diseases (1-3). In epidemio-
logic studies, the most common methods used to as-
sess alcohol intake are self-reported. While much ef-
fort has been devoted to assessment of the validity and
reliability of self-reported alcohol intake (4-6), little
information exists on the reliability of alcohol intake
as recalled from the remote past. Because alcohol
intake in the past may be more relevant to chronic
disease than is current intake and the case-control
method is often used in studies of chronic diseases and
alcohol, the ability to reliably recall alcohol intake in
the past is of central importance in examining the
association between alcohol intake and chronic dis-
eases.

Previous studies with different follow-up intervals
have shown recalled alcohol intake to be reasonably
reliable (7-9). However, evaluation of the reliability
and accuracy in assessing past alcohol intake among
different subgroups of the general population has re-
ceived little attention. In particular, questions regard-
ing whether and how recalled alcohol intake is related
to current drinking status have not been answered. In
this study, we use data from a national cohort of US
adults to examine 1) the reliability of alcohol recall
over a 10-year period; and 2) the factors possibly
influential on the recall of past drinking and those that
might lead to systematic bias in recalled alcohol in-
take.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From the First National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES I), a prospective cohort
study, the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up
Study, was developed. NHANES I was conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics from 1971 to
1975. Details of the sample selection and methodology
have been published previously (10). In short, subjects
were traced and reinterviewed for the follow-up study
between 1982 and 1984. A total of 14,407 adults aged
25-74 years who were examined in NHANES I from
1971-1975 were eligible for inclusion in the
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. People
were excluded from the original cohort for the follow-

ing reasons: 1,024 (7.1 percent) had vital status miss-
ing at follow-up; 838 (5.8 percent) were found to be
alive, but were not reinterviewed; 2,022 (14.0 percent)
had died; 81 (0.6 percent) had drinking information
missing at baseline or follow-up; and 601 (4.2 percent)
had information missing on one or more other influ-
encing factors. These exclusions left 9,841 members
of the original cohort.
We assessed alcohol intake both at the baseline and
during follow-up interviews. Alcohol intake as a con-
tinuous variable, expressed as drinks per day, was
based on a series of quantity-frequency questions on
the medical history interview. At the baseline inter-
view, these questions were asked:"During the past
year have you had at least one drink of beer, wine, or
liquor? (yes, no)". Those who answered yes were then
asked: "How often do you drink? (every day, just
about every day, about 2 or 3 times a week, about 1-4
times a month, more than 3 but less than 12 times a
year, or no more than 2 or 3 times a year)"; and "When
you drink, how much do you usually drink over 24
hours?"
We categorized people into four groups at baseline:
1) those who reported that they had less than 12 drinks
a year; 2) those who had less than one drink a week;
3) those who had greater than or equal to one drink a
week, but less than 10 drinks a week; and 4) those who
had 10 or more drinks a week.
At the follow-up interview, we asked, "Have you
had at least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic bever-
age in any one year?" (yes, no). Respondents who
answered yes were then asked: "Have you had at least
one drink of beer, wine, or liquor during the past
year?" "On the average, how often do you drink alco-
holic beverages, that is, beer, wine, or liquor?" "On the
days you have a drink, about how many drinks do you
usually have?"
We used the same categories as those at baseline to
categorize current drinking status into four groups.
The categorization and choice of cutoff points was
contingent upon the questions used in assessing the
recalled alcohol intake in this study.
During the follow-up interview, the following set of
retrospective questions on drinking habits at baseline
was also asked: "Which category best describes your
usual drinking pattern when you were about 25 years
old?" (nine or more drinks a day or 60 or more drinks
a week; about 6-8 drinks a day or 40-59 drinks a
week; about four to five drinks a day or 25-39 drinks
a week; about two or three drinks a day or 10-24
drinks a week; 1-9 drinks a week; less than one drink
a week; and less than 12 drinks a year).
This question was repeated for each of the following
age groups: 35, 45, 55, and 65 years. Very few par-
ticipants had more than 24 drinks per week; therefore,
we combined them with the 10-24 drinks per week as
the top-rank drinking group to get stable estimates.
Since the average follow-up period was 10 years, we
selected participants who recalled their alcohol intake
within 1 year of age 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65 years at
baseline. This led to a final sample of 2,907 persons
who were 10 years older at the time of the follow-up
interview. We found similar distributions in sex, race,
education status, smoking, drinking status at baseline,
and disease status between the excluded members of
the original cohort and those who remained in the final
analysis, apart from the age difference. To treat alco-
hol intake as a continuous variable in some of the
analyses, we also used the midpoint value of each
drinking category to represent each participant's aver-
age alcohol intake.
We examined reliability by calculating the
Spearman rank order correlation coefficients (11) and
the kappa statistics (12) between the two interviews.
By comparing the age-adjusted partial Spearman cor-
relation coefficients, we further examined factors that
might affect the reliability of the recall of past alcohol
consumption across strata of various factors. (Formu-
las and methods in calculation of the partial Spearman
correlation coefficients can be found in SAS procedure
guide, 6.03 edition, pp. 130-152 (13)). These factors
included sex, education level (less than high school,
completed high school, and more than high school),
smoking status (former, current, never), current drink-
ing status, and the occurrence of chronic disease dur-
ing the follow-up period. Disease status during the
follow-up period was based on chronic conditions
reported at the follow-up interview that were not re-
ported at the baseline interview, including diabetes,
hypertension, thyroid problem, heart disease, cancer,
chronic lung disease, and colitis.
We calculated the means and standard deviations for
alcohol intake at baseline, recalled alcohol intake, and
current alcohol intake at follow-up. We then used
analysis of covariance (14, 15) to examine further any
systematic bias of recalled alcohol intake by category
of current drinkers, age, race, education, disease sta-
tus, and smoking status. We further assessed the rel-
ative validity of recall by examining the sensitivity,
specificity, predictive value positive, and predictive
value negative (16) at two levels of intake: 12 or more
drinks per year versus less than 12 drinks per year and
10 or more drinks per week versus less than 10 drinks
per week.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the sample
Both at baseline and at follow-up, drinkers were
more likely to be younger, white, and better educated
(table 1). In general, the proportion of those who had
10 or more drinks per week and those who had less
than 12 drinks per year increased during the follow-up
period. The same trend was also observed among
different subgroups by sex, age, education, smoking
status, and disease status (table 1).
Reliability of recalled alcohol intake and possible
influencing factors
In general, there was good agreement between re-
called alcohol intake and reported intake at baseline.
The concordance rates (recalled intake in the same
category of baseline intake) ranged from 51 to 77
percent, and the weighted kappa ranged from 0.29 to
0.50, with older people recalling their past reported
intake more consistently than did younger people (ta-
ble 2). However, heavier drinkers (10 or more drinks
per week) tended to underestimate their recall, this
was more evident in women (table 2). Women tended
to recall slightly better than men (kappa statistic =
0.45 for women and 0.38 for men), which is consistent
with the average Spearman correlation coefficients
(r = 0.7 for women and r = 0.6 for men).
The Spearman correlation coefficients between re-
called and baseline alcohol intakes ranged from 0.52
to 0.74 (table 3). Across different age groups, the
correlations between current alcohol intake and base-
line intake were somewhat lower than the correlations
between recalled intake and baseline intake. In gen-
eral, the correlations were lowest for current alcohol
intake versus baseline intake. After those who reported
fewer than 12 drinks a year at both surveys were
excluded, the performance of recalled intake remained
better than that of current intake in assessing the

baseline intake, while the absolute correlation coeffi-
cients decreased (results not shown).
Regardless of age, race, sex, education, smoking
status, and disease status during the follow-up, the
Spearman correlation coefficients (table 4) were
higher for recalled versus baseline intake than for
current intake versus baseline intake. Among both
men and women, the reliability of recalled alcohol
intake did not vary with disease status. There was no
difference in recalled alcohol intake versus baseline
alcohol intake between white men and nonwhite men,
although white women showed higher correlation than
did nonwhite women (table 4). Both men and women
with more than a high school education appeared to
have higher age-adjusted partial correlation coeffi-
cients for recalled versus baseline intake than did those
with lower levels of education. In men, smoking status
appeared to be a strong influencing factor on the
reliability of recalled intake; current smokers appeared
to be less reliable in recalling past intake than were
nonsmokers.
The assessment of accuracy of recalled intake
We observed no differences in means for recalled
alcohol intake and reported alcohol intake at baseline
for women, but men tended to underestimate their
baseline intake slightly (table 5). Table 5 also shows
estimates of the difference between the recalled intake
and baseline intake by category of race, age, educa-
tion, smoking status, disease status, and current drink-
ers at follow-up. Age, education and current drinking
status appeared to be strong influencing factors in
recalling past alcohol intake. For both men and
women, older persons tended to underestimate their
alcohol intake in the past, while younger people over-
estimated their alcohol intake in the past. Among men,
never smokers and those who had at least a high
school education tended to underestimate their alcohol
intake in the past. There were no systematic differ-
ences among subgroups by disease status. We ob-
served a systematic underestimation of recalled alco-
hol intake among current heavier drinkers of both
sexes, but no appreciable systematic bias among other
groups of current drinkers.
Table 6 describes all of the screening indices in
relation to distinguishing drinkers from nondrinkers
(defined as less than 12 drinks a year) and heavier
drinkers (10 or more drinks per week) from other
drinkers. For both men and women, sensitivity was
highest for assessing those who had at least 12 drinks
a year versus those who had fewer than 12 drinks a
year (e.g., 93 percent of the men and 84 percent of the
women who reported that they had at least 12 drinks a
year at baseline recalled that they had drunk at least 12

predictive value positive appeared to be much lower
for assessing those who had 10 or more drinks per
week (heavier drinker) versus other drinkers. This was
more evident in women than in men.
DISCUSSION
In this sample of US adults, we found an overall
good agreement (r = 0.7) between recalled and re-
ported baseline intake. However, recall reliability dif-
fered among different subgroups by age, education
level, and smoking status, but not by disease status.
We also found that recalled alcohol intake was highly
correlated with current alcohol intake and that current
heavier drinkers tended to underestimate their previ-
ous amount of drinking.
The general agreement (r = 0.7) in our study is
consistent with that reported by Longnecker et al. (8).
In their sample of 211 female residents of Massachu-
setts and Wisconsin, the Spearman correlation coeffi-
cients ranged from 0.75 to 0.81 for recalled alcohol
intake versus baseline intake. The authors also found
that 70 percent of the women recalled themselves in
the same drinking category after 6-12 months, which
is also consistent with our findings: The concordance

intake) ranged from 51 to 77 percent. Giovannucci et
al. (17) used the Nurses' Health Study to compare
alcohol intake, which was assessed by detailed diet
records. Four years after completing the diet records,
the subjects were asked to report their alcohol intake
from 4 years earlier. The investigators also found a
high correlation between recalled alcohol intake and
diet records (r = 0.84). However, no information on
reliability of recalled intake among subsets of the
sample in these studies was available (for example,
according to age, smoking status, or education status).
Our study has the advantage of being large and based
on a sample from the general population. Thus, we had
enough statistical power to examine the reliability of
recalled alcohol intake among different subsets of the
sample. We did find that people from some subgroups
(age, education, and current drinking status) had dif-
ferent degrees of reliability (tables 3 and 4). In addi-
tion, one important point warrants special attention:
Persons from subgroups with higher reliability did not
necessarily recall accurately. For example, we ob-
served that older people recalled more consistently
than did their younger counterparts, but they also
underestimated their alcohol intake in the past. Men
with a high school education or higher recalled more
consistently than did people with a less than high
school education (table 4), but they were more likely
to underestimate their alcohol intake in the past (table
5). In case-control studies in which these factors may
act as confounders or effect modifiers of the associa-
tion between alcohol intake early in life and any spe-
cific disease of interest, use of recalled data can intro-
duce biases. Unfortunately, there is no universal rule
that can be applied to assess the direction and magni-
tude of the biases, and one should assess them on an
individual basis depending upon the specific outcome
of interest. Additional data on characteristics related to
the recalled reliability and accuracy of the past drink-
ing would be warranted to confirm these findings.
Few previous studies (9, 18-20) have examined
whether recalled intake was influenced by current
intake. Results of these studies are mixed. Lee et al.
(9) studied the reliability of recalled measures of al-
cohol intake in a cohort of 873 California residents.
Baseline data were collected in 1972, and the partici-
pants were reinterviewed in 1983. The authors found
that the correlation between the recalled versus base-
line intake (r = 0.73) was higher than that for current
versus baseline intake (r = 0.68). In addition, similar
to our findings, they also reported that the sensitivity
for detecting heavier drinkers from other drinkers was
low (0.65 for men and 0.61 for women). However, the
recalled alcohol intake did not seem to be influenced
by current intake in that study. Simpura and
Poikalainen (18) reported that adult men reinterviewed
18 years later overestimated their originally reported
alcohol intake, but reports were not biased by current
use. In contrast, Czarnecki et al. (19) examined 73
gynecologic outpatients and observed several system-
atic differences in the reliability of self-reported intake
as a function of time, including both original and
current drinking patterns. A study conducted by
Collins et al. (20) in a group of high school students
showed that over a 2.5-year interval, students tended
to report less alcohol use in retrospect than they had
originally reported. They also found that reports were
influenced by current alcohol intake. In our study,
regardless of age, race, sex, education, smoking status,
and disease status during the follow-up period, the
Spearman correlation coefficients were higher for re-
called versus baseline intake than for current versus
baseline intake. This finding suggests that recalled
alcohol intake is a better predictor of past intake than
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 143, No. 2, 1996
Reliability of Recalled Alcohol Intake 185
is current intake, even though current drinking status
may influence recall of past drinking.
We found the recall of alcohol intake did not differ
by disease status. Thus, in case-control studies in
which one usually uses recalled information of alcohol
intake, any association between the disease and alco-
hol intake early in life would likely be biased toward
the null. Furthermore, we observed that heavier drink-
ers at baseline were less consistent in their recalled
alcohol intake than were lighter drinkers, and they
tended to underestimate past drinking in 10 year recall
reports (tables 2 and 6). This might underestimate the
association of heavy consumption with disease out-
comes and attenuate any possible dose-response rela-
tion between alcohol intake and outcomes of interest.
However, caution should also be exercised as the
possible misclassification of past drinking early in life
might not always be nondifferential (21).
Limitations need to be considered when interpreting
these study results. First, the drinking questions asked
in this study were frequency of drinking and usual
quantity of consumption. We did not have information
on the maximum that respondents drank on any occa-
sion and the frequency of drinking that much. Such
questions may yield higher estimates of drinking and,
hence, results in a greater range of variability of alco-
hol consumption (6, 22). Thus, it is possible that
inclusion of such questions would have lowered the
consistency of recall. However, the quantity-frequency
questions have indeed been used widely in assessing
the average alcohol intake in the studies of alcohol
intake and chronic diseases (1-3, 22). Second, ques-
tions on alcohol intake at the baseline interview were
somewhat different from those at the follow-up. We
were not able to distinguish those who had fewer than
12 drinks a year from abstainers. Nevertheless, the
main findings were similar when we excluded those
who reported they had fewer than 12 drinks a year at
both the baseline and follow-up interviews. Third,
assigning the midpoint value of each drinking category
of recalled intake may also be a problem if the mid-
point values do not reflect average intake within that
category. However, we conducted two sensitivity anal-
yses by using means and medians of each of the
corresponding current drinking groups at follow-up
and assigning these values to each of the recalled
drinking category. Results from the analysis of covari-
ance were similar (data not shown). In addition, we
observed almost no difference between the mean of
past alcohol intake and that of the recalled intake in the
entire sample, while we observed differences among
some of the subgroups (table 5). This finding could not
be explained by using midpoint values. Finally, it is
important to note that no absolute gold standard re-
garding the measurement of alcohol intake was avail-
able: We had to rely on self-reported alcohol intake at
baseline, which certainly included reporting errors, to
assess the relative validity of the recalled intake as
indicators of intake at baseline.
In summary, although recalled alcohol intake is
generally reliable, accuracy differs somewhat among
different subgroups. In particular, there appears to be
substantial underestimation of recalled alcohol intake
by current heavier drinkers. Nonetheless, reports of
recalled past drinking provide better estimates of past
drinking than do measures of current drinking. Addi-
tional data on the recalled reliability and accuracy of
the past drinking history among people with different
characteristics as well as the recall of some other key
interrelated behavior such as smoking may help us in
the design, analysis, and interpretation of future case-
control studies.
