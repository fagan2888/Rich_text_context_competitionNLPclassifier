The primary purpose of this study is to assess the relative effects of race and
class, at both individual and neighborhood levels, on public satisfaction with
police. Using hierarchical linear modeling on 1,963 individuals nested within 66
neighborhoods, this study analyzes how individual-level variables, including race,
class, age, gender, victimization and contact with police, and neighborhood-level
factors, including racial composition, concentrated disadvantage, residential
mobility and violent crime rate, influence residents' satisfaction with police. The
results from the individual-level analysis indicate that both race and class are
equally important predictors. African Americans and lower-class people tend to
be less satisfied with police. The significant effects of race and class, however,
disappear when neighborhood-level characteristics are considered simulta-
neously. Neighborhood racial composition affects satisfaction with police, with
residents in predominately White and racially mixed neighborhoods having more
favorable attitudes than those in predominately African American communities.
Further analyses reveal that African Americans in economically advantaged neigh-
borhoods are less likely than Whites in the same kind of neighborhoods to be
satisfied with police, whereas African Americans and Whites in disadvantaged
communities hold similar levels of satisfaction with police. Implications for future
research and policy are discussed.

Introduction
The past four decades have witnessed a substantial amount of empirical
research examining citizens' satisfaction with police. Most studies focus on the
effects of individual background characteristics such as race, age, sex, income
and education (e.g., Brandl, Frank, Worden, & Bynum, 1994; Carter, 1985;
Huang & Vaughn, 1996; Hurst & Frank, 2000; Jefferson & Walker, 1993; Skogan,
1978; Sullivan, Dunham, & Alpert, 1987; Weitzer & Tuch, 1999, 2002). Some
research went further to incorporate individuals' personal or vicarious experi-
ences, such as victimization and contact with police, into the analysis (e.g.,
Cao, Frank, & Cullen, 1996; Correia, Reisig, & Lovrich, 1996; Dean, 1980;
Homant, Kennedy, & Fleming, 1984; Koenig, 1980; Priest & Carter, 1999;
Tewksbury & West, 2001; Weitzer & Tuch, 2002). Recently interest in studying
the impact of neighborhood contexts on residents' perceptions of police has
emerged (e.g., Cao et al., 1996; Dunham & Alpert, 1988; Reisig & Parks, 2000,
2003; Sampson & Jeglum-Bartusch, 1998; Weitzer, 1999, 2000; Weitzer & Tuch,
2004a, 2005a, 2005b).
The primary purpose of this study is to examine the relative importance of
race and class in measuring citizen satisfaction with police. From Bayley and
Mendelsohn's (1969) early study of police­minority relations to Weitzer and
Tuch's (2005b) recent analyses of racially biased policing, race has been one of
the most important and consistent predictors of citizens' perceptions of police.
A growing number of studies, however, question the primacy of race and stress
the importance of neighborhood contextual characteristics in shaping citizens'
evaluations of police. Some researchers find that the effect of race or ethnicity
is not significant when neighborhood contextual variables are simultaneously
considered (e.g., Cao et al., 1996; Jesilow, Meyer, & Namazzi, 1995; Sampson &
Jeglum-Bartusch, 1998; Schuman & Gruenberg, 1972). Others specifically
suggest that neighborhood class status plays an equally important, if not
greater, role in determining satisfaction with police (Dunham & Alpert, 1988;
Weitzer, 1999, 2000). Although studies continue to report a significant racial
effect even after introducing contextual variables (e.g., Garcia & Cao, 2005;
Reisig & Parks, 2000; Webb & Marshall, 1995), more research clearly is needed
to clarify the influences of race and class on citizens' attitudes toward police.
Several other reasons, chiefly methodological considerations, justify this
research. First, this study employs a multilevel modeling strategy to assess the
explanatory power of both the individual- and neighborhood-level predictors of
perceptions of police. With the exception of two studies (i.e., Reisig & Parks,
2000; Sampson & Jeglum-Bartusch, 1998), previous research either assessed the
influences of individual-level variables exclusively or used neighborhood contex-
tual variables in individual-level analyses. This microlevel approach could be
problematic for two reasons. One is that these studies could have violated the
RACE, CLASS OR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT 127
assumption of independence for regression analysis because respondents who
are naturally nested in a same neighborhood are often correlated with each
other in certain ways. The other is that these studies could not assess cross-
level effects since the estimates are not adjusted for the covariates, regardless
of whether they are measured at the individual or the contextual level. They
also fail to measure the independent effects of neighborhood characteristics
adjusting all individual predictors. To address these concerns, the current study
includes both individual- and neighborhood-level variables and examines their
influences on citizen satisfaction with police simultaneously.
A second and related issue is that this research constructs the measures of
race and class at both the individual and neighborhood levels. While individual
race and class are commonly considered in past research on satisfaction with
police, the inclusion of both at the neighborhood-level analysis is rare. A
pivotal measure employed by recent macrolevel studies is concentrated disad-
vantage, which is constructed by combining neighborhood racial composition
(i.e., percent Black) and class status (i.e., percent poverty, unemployed, and
female-headed family) into a single scale (Reisig & Parks, 2000; Sampson &
Jeglum-Bartusch, 1998). Although this scale correctly signals the socially and
economically disadvantaged status of neighborhoods, it may not allow
researchers to examine the relative explanatory power of neighborhood racial
makeup and neighborhood class level and possible inter-racial distinctions
along class lines.
Finally, multiple scales are employed to measure neighborhood contextual
characteristics. The two studies that performed a multilevel analysis on
attitudes toward police considered four neighborhood contextual variables,
including concentrated disadvantage, immigrant concentration and residential
mobility in Sampson and Jeglum-Bartusch (1998) and concentrated disadvantage
and homicide rate in Reisig and Parks (2000). This study uses concentrated
disadvantage and residential mobility and two more measures, racial composi-
tion and violent crime rate. This group of variables arguably represents a more
comprehensive collection of theoretically relevant neighborhood-level predic-
tors of satisfaction with police.1
In brief, the aim of this research is threefold: (1) to assess the effects of
individual race and class on determining resident satisfaction with police,
controlling for other background characteristics and personal experience; (2) to
examine the effects and relative importance of neighborhood racial and class
variables on citizens' satisfaction with police, controlling for other contextual
variables, individual characteristics and personal experience; and (3) to analyze
inter-racial differences in attitudes toward police across distinctive neighbor-
hood socioeconomic status.
1. Several other neighborhood contextual characteristics, including neighborhood social and
physical disorder, collective efficacy, and perceived crime conditions, were also constructed and
examined in the preliminary analysis. All these scales, however, are highly (r > .7) correlated with
the measure of concentrated disadvantage and are thus dropped from the study.

Predicting Satisfaction with the Police
Starting from the late 1960s, there has been a rich tradition in criminological
research studying public perceptions of the police. Overall, evidence from
previous research indicates a widespread positive and supportive attitude
toward police (Huang & Vaughn, 1996). Empirical findings suggest, however,
that the level of satisfaction can vary across a variety of individual characteris-
tics, individual experiences and neighborhood characteristics. We thus propose
that a comprehensive theoretical framework of public satisfaction with the
police should incorporate three different perspectives--individual background
characteristics, personal and vicarious experiences, and neighborhood contexts.
Individual background characteristics
Theoretical explanations that focus on the influence of individual characteris-
tics and personal/vicarious experiences are the two most popular perspectives
in explaining citizen satisfaction with the police. The individual-characteristic
explanation posits that citizens' individual background characteristics, such as
race, class, age and gender, influence their attitudes toward the police.
Race
Race has been the focal concern of a considerable number of past studies on
attitudes toward police. Racial minorities, African Americans in the case of
much of the research, are found to be less likely than Whites to display
favorable attitudes toward police (see Brown & Benedict, 2002 and Decker,
1981 for a summary of past findings). Two theoretical models derived from
conflict theory, the sense-of-injustice model and the group-position model, can
be used to explain this finding.
The sense-of-injustice model posits that public attitudes toward criminal
justice agencies are heavily influenced by the feeling of being treated unjustly
by the gatekeepers of the criminal justice system--police officers. Applying this
argument to race, minorities, especially African Americans, tend to display less
favorable attitudes toward police because they are more likely than White
Americans to have a sense of unequal treatment by the criminal justice system,
in general, and the police, in particular. Two sources may contribute to a
higher level of sense-of-injustice among Blacks. First, African Americans are
consistently overrepresented in the criminal justice system, making up less
than 12 percent of the total US population in 2004 but constituting 37 percent
of the total arrests for violent crime and nearly 40 percent of all inmates in
state and federal correctional facilities (Maguire & Pastore, 2007). This over-
representation has generated serious concerns about the fairness of law
enforcement in America. Accordingly, many African Americans tend to view
RACE, CLASS OR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT 129
police as "occupying armies" in Black neighborhoods whose job is mainly to
protect the status quo and to serve the interests of people in power
(Cashmore, 1991). Recent, highly publicized problems in law enforcement,
such as racial profiling or driving while Black, produce more concerns about
possible racism.
Second, African Americans are also more likely to be victims of both violent
and property crimes. In 2005, the victimization rate (per 1,000 persons age 12
and older) for violent crimes was 27 for Blacks and 20 for Whites and personal
theft is 1.7 for Blacks and .9 for Whites (Maguire & Pastore, 2007). Many African
Americans believe that they are victims of both overpolicing and underpolicing
(Barlow & Barlow, 2000). That is, while residents in largely African American
neighborhoods perceive that they are often subject to overly aggressive police
tactics and practices, they also perceive that they are denied equal protection
by police who are not willing to deal with disorder and crime problems in minority
neighborhoods (Anderson, 1999; Dillingham, 1974).
The core arguments of the sense-of-injustice model are in line with the find-
ings from studies on procedural justice which suggest that citizens' perceptions
of local legal authorities, including the police, are heavily influenced by
whether they perceive criminal justice agencies as fair and equitable in both
the procedures for making decisions and the outcomes of the decisions (Tyler,
1990; Tyler & Degoey, 1995). Indeed, low perceptions of police legitimacy may
lead to low citizen cooperation and satisfaction with police, poor police-
community relations, and high crime rates (Anderson, 1999; LaFree, 1998;
Tyler, 1990, 2003).
A second model that has been used to explain the Black­White differences in
attitudes toward police is the group-position perspective. Originating from
Blumer's (1958) group-position theory of racial prejudice and extended by
Weitzer and Tuch's (2004b, 2005a) research on attitudes toward police, this
model asserts that group orientations toward social institutions spring mainly
from a sense of group position that involves "group identity, out-group stereo-
typing, preferred group status, and perceived threat" (Bobo & Hutchings, 1996,
p. 955). Specifically, members of the dominant group (i.e., the in-group) tend
to share a sense of superiority, view members of the subordinate group (i.e.,
the out-group) as intrinsically different and alien, display a belief about proper
claim over certain rights, statuses, privileges and resources, and perceive out-
group members as significant competitors for a greater portion of dominant
group prerogatives (Bobo & Tuan, 2006).
Extending these arguments to racial attitudes toward police, Whites are more
likely to hold favorable opinions of the police because they perceive this social
institution as critical and scarce resources to which they are entitled and, more
importantly, with which their interests and superiority are ensured. The stereo-
typing images of African Americans (e.g., more violent and prone to crime)
commonly held by many Whites also lead to strong support among Whites for
aggressive law enforcement against Black Americans and neighborhoods
(Weitzer & Tuch, 2004b). Racial prejudice associated with a sense of group
130 WU ET AL.
position thus is one of the key factors differentiating Blacks' and Whites' views
of the police.
The majority of previous studies on race and attitudes towards the police
have found a significant link between them supporting the predictions of both
the sense-of-injustice and the group-position models. Early studies conducted at
the request of President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration
of Justice in the 1960s found that although there was widespread satisfaction
with the police, minorities were notably less favorable than Whites in their
judgments of different aspects of police practice (President's Commission on
Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, 1967). More recent studies
have reached similar conclusions (e.g., Brandl et al., 1994; Carter, 1985; Huang
& Vaughn, 1996; Jefferson & Walker, 1993; Murty, Roebuck, & Smith, 1990).
Researchers suggest that this difference exists because of the differential treat-
ment of Whites and Blacks by police, in reality or by respondents' perceptions.
For example, Weitzer (2000) examined citizens' perceptions of racialized
policing and found that there was a shared belief across White and Black
communities that police treated Whites and Blacks differently.
A small number of studies, however, have found that race has a weak or nil
effect on citizens' evaluations of police. Jesilow, Meyer and Namazzi (1995), for
instance, found that ethnicity is not a good predictor of attitudes toward police.
Frank and colleagues (1996) actually found that African Americans in Detroit
held more favorable views of the police than did White residents. They
explained this "Detroit exception" by suggesting that a number of American
cities were going through an ethno-racial political transition, which has dramat-
ically enhanced African Americans' political influence, including the election of
Black mayors and the appointment of Black police chiefs. A recent replication of
this study in Washington, DC, however, reached a contradictory conclusion,
with African American respondents reporting lower levels of satisfaction with
police (Smith, 2005).
Class
Class or socioeconomic status (SES), measured in a variety of ways, is another
factor commonly used in research on citizen satisfaction with police. As with
race, both the sense-of-injustice and the group-position perspectives are appro-
priate for the explanation of class differences in attitudes toward police. The
sense-of-injustice model suggests that working-class people will hold less favor-
able attitudes toward police than wealthy people because they are more likely
to be the subjects of police control actions (Black, 1971; Black & Reiss, 1970;
Friedrich, 1980; Reiss, 1971). Black (1976) specifically proposes that police
responses to incidents vary, depending upon the location of the citizens in social
space as measured by the race, sex, age, and social class of the parties. For
example, he argues that citizens of the lower ranks (e.g., Blacks, women,
children and lower and working classes) are more likely than the higher ranks to
RACE, CLASS OR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT 131
be handled in a penal style (e.g., arrest), and less likely to be handled in a
conciliatory or therapeutic style (e.g., mediation, separation, and counseling).
Similarly, the group-position model would suggest that members of a high socio-
economic tier are more inclined to have a close relationship with police since
they rely on the police to serve their interests.
A number of empirical studies have found a significant connection between
social class and evaluations of police, with people in the lower socioeconomic
stratus more likely to have less favorable attitudes toward police than the
wealthy (e.g., Cao et al., 1996; Huang & Vaughn, 1996; Percy, 1980; Sampson
& Jeglum-Bartusch, 1998). Other studies show that class conditions the effect
of race on satisfaction with police, but the findings are less than conclusive.
While some found that Whites' perceptions of the police become more positive
as they move up the social structure (Hagan & Albonetti, 1982), others showed
that wealthy Blacks are more likely than poor Blacks to be less supportive of
the police (Boggs & Galliher, 1975; Gamson & McEvoy, 1970; Hagan &
Albonetti, 1982). Still others found that economically and educationally advan-
taged Blacks have more favorable evaluations of police (Priest & Carter,
1999).
Age and gender
Two additional individual characteristics, age and gender, have been noted in
the research on public perceptions of police. It has been widely observed that
younger citizens tend to have less favorable attitudes toward police than older
citizens (Hurst & Frank, 2000; Weitzer & Tuch, 2002), although this relationship
has received less than consistent support (Decker, 1981). Some researchers
argue that age is a stronger predictor of attitudes than race, gender, or social-
ization (Peek, Lowe, & Alston, 1981; Wilson, 1985). Others, however, observe
that the relationship between age and attitudes is unstable (Smith & Hawkins,
1973). Still others found that the types of contact between youth and police are
the determinants of attitudes toward these authority figures (Rusinko, Johnson,
& Hornung, 1978).
To explain the less positive attitudes toward police held by youth, Gaines,
Kappeler, and Vaughn (1994) suggested that younger people are more freedom-
oriented, while older people were more safety-oriented. In addition, they
suggested that younger people have less positive attitudes toward police
because they are more likely to engage in risky behaviors than elderly people.
Taylor and colleagues (2001) found that rather than holding negative percep-
tions, juveniles are generally indifferent in their attitudes toward police.
Sullivan, Dunham, and Alpert (1987, p. 192) argued that different age groups
may have different conceptualizations. For example, violence means more in
conceptualizing police demeanor towards Black teens than towards Black
adults. Therefore, they concluded that "attitudes are not unidimensional and
are structured differently for different groups".
132 WU ET AL.
Compared to race, class, and age, findings on the impact of gender on public
satisfaction with police are less equivocal. Some studies have shown that males
tend to hold less favorable attitudes toward police than females (Apple &
O'Brien, 1983; Taylor et al., 2001; Weitzer & Tuch, 2002), while a few others
found that males hold more favorable attitudes (e.g., Correia, Reisig, & Lovrich,
1996; Hurst & Frank, 2000). An interactive effect may exist between age and
gender. For example, younger men tend to hold the most negative attitudes
toward police (Wilson, 1985).
Personal and vicarious experiences
The personal- and vicarious-experience explanation argues that individuals'
personal and/or vicarious experiences with crime and criminal justice, in
general, and the police, in particular, shape their evaluations of the police. Two
types of individual and vicarious experiences related to crime/criminal justice
and police, victimization and contact with police, have often been employed in
research on public attitudes toward police.
Researchers have not reached a consensus on the relationship between victim-
ization and satisfaction with police. Some early studies found that recent expe-
rience as a victim did not influence attitudes toward police (Biderman, Louise,
Jennie, & Adrianne, 1967; Block, 1970; Smith & Hawkins, 1973); neither did
threat of criminal victimization, either property or personal (Smith & Hawkins,
1973). By and large, more recent studies, however, have indicated that victim-
ization experiences tended to increase unfavorable attitudes toward police
(Homant et al., 1984; Koenig, 1980). In fact, Cao, Frank, and Cullen (1996) found
that recent victimization experiences and fear of crime had a larger impact on
citizens' confidence on police than any of their demographic variables (but see
Jackson & Sunshine, 2006). Others discovered that the effect of victimization on
perceptions of police is conditional on race. For example, Apple and O'Brien
(1983) found that victimization was negatively associated with perceptions of
police for Whites but not for Blacks (but see Priest & Carter, 1999).
One explanation for the negative association between victimization and
satisfaction with police is that victimization has a negative effect on citizens'
satisfaction through the mediating factor of "contact with the police." Contact
with police has been found to influence public attitudes toward police.
Research done in New Zealand showed that younger victims, victims of
burglary, and victims who were beneficiaries were more likely than other types
of victims to express higher levels of dissatisfaction with police response
(Morris, Reilly, Berry, & Ransom, 2003). They reported two reasons for victims'
dissatisfaction: "the police were seen as not having done enough" and "the
police appeared uninterested" (p. 24). In addition, Tewksbury and West (2001)
assessed crime victims' perceptions of police in one urban American community
and found that the most satisfied citizens were those who perceived officers as
helpful, concerned, and courteous.
RACE, CLASS OR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT 133
The effect of contact with the police has been revealed to differ based on
two main factors: the type of police contact and the performance of police on
the scene. Previous research has consistently shown that type of police contact
makes a difference. Citizens who come into contact with police can be, among
others, offenders, victims, or service requesters. The first two groups can be
seen as people who experience involuntary contacts, while the third group
includes people who experience voluntary contacts. Bordua and Tifft (1971)
found that individuals who were stopped and searched (i.e., experience invol-
untary contact) were more likely to report that police did not deserve more
respect than those without such experience. Similarly, Dean (1980) found that
individuals who come into contact as a result of criminal victimization or traffic
stops tended to express significantly lower levels of satisfaction with police,
while individuals who initiate police contact through calls for service did not
show such a trend. This, however, contradicts with an earlier study done by
Boggs and Galliher (1975) who found that individuals who had called the police
for service had more negative evaluations, while police-initiated contacts
seemed to have little impact on citizens' assessments.
A recent study by Jesilow, Meyer, and Namazzi (1995) found that requests
for police service are associated with both positive and negative comments.
This might be because the researchers combined reporting crime and requests
for service as one predictor, thus may include the perception of crime victims.
As aforementioned research reveals, victimization experience tends to be
negatively related to citizens' satisfaction with police. Another recent study
created four dichotomous variables: call dissatisfaction and call satisfaction for
those who had requested police service within the past six months, and stop
dissatisfaction and stop satisfaction for those who had been pulled over by
police within the past six months (Reisig & Parks, 2000). They found that indi-
viduals who were satisfied with either a call for service or a traffic stop were
more satisfied with police than persons who had no contact with police.
Research also showed that as the number of contacts with police increased, the
level of public satisfaction decreased regardless of the nature of contacts
(Carter, 1985).
Despite these fairly consistent findings, there is some research showing that
positive interactions between residents and police do not influence residents'
perceptions of officer effectiveness. For example, Hawdon and Ryan (2003) did
an empirical test of community policing and found that it is the visible presence
of officers in the neighborhoods, rather than the positive interactions between
residents and police, that improved respondents' opinions of police.
Officers' actions on the crime scene are also important predictors. Research
has shown that evaluations of response time affect public satisfaction with
police both in the cases of handling victimization (Carter, 1985; Percy, 1980)
and evaluations of overall police performance (Priest & Carter, 1999). In addi-
tion, an early study found that citizens are more likely to be satisfied with police
when officers take their time to explain their course of action (Furstenberg &
Wellford, 1973).
134 WU ET AL.
More recent studies confirm that citizens' perceptions of injustice under
circumstances like a traffic stop by police are based more on normative factors
than instrumental factors (e.g., Engel, 2005). That is, citizens' perceptions of
procedural fairness and justice are as important as, if not more important than,
the perceptions of fair outcome in determining citizens' satisfaction level with
the criminal justice system. Therefore, there is an important association
between the way in which citizens are treated and the positive perceptions of
police (Correia et al., 1996). Skogan (2005) argued that it was how police
treated those they stopped or served that accounted most for the link between
social cleavage and perception of police. He contrasted the effects of experien-
tial, on-scene factors with those of race, age, gender, and language on satisfac-
tion with encounters between police and residents, and argued that the
personal characteristics of city residents affected satisfaction primarily through
the mediating variables of on-scene actions by police. Recent studies confirm
the importance of attributes of officers (e.g., demeanor and fairness) and the
encounter (e.g., response time) in shaping citizens' attitudes toward police
(Frank, Smith, & Novak, 2005; Tyler, 2005).
Neighborhood characteristics
The neighborhood-context explanation suggests that public satisfaction with the
police can be explained in terms of demographic and institutional characteris-
tics of communities. This explanation can be linked to an ecological explanation
of criminal behavior, the social disorganization theory, which argues that neigh-
borhood structural characteristics, such as poverty, racial heterogeneity and
residential mobility, have both a direct and an indirect impact on the crime/
delinquency rates through the mediating factors of social disorganization
(Sampson & Groves, 1989). Applying these ideas to the study of public percep-
tion of criminal justice agencies, an argument can be made that low satisfaction
with police, in part, results from neighborhood structural characteristics and
levels of social organization. Neighborhoods characterized by high levels of
poverty, racial heterogeneity and residential mobility would breed aggregated
dissatisfaction with police because in these areas, there is an imbalance
between formal control and informal control. Informal control decreases as
neighbors are unable to agree upon and work toward common goals, as
predicted by the theory of social disorganization. When informal social control
is weak, formal social control increases, producing an increased likelihood of
conflicts between neighborhood residents and police officers. Socially disadvan-
taged neighborhoods also have the weakest ability to "... influence political and
economic decision-making and to acquire externally based goods and services
that may increase its ability to control crime in the area" (Bursik & Grasmick,
1993, p. 52) including the exercise of police power.
Though not often clearly specifying social disorganization theory as a foun-
dation, recent research has begun to note the varied assessments of the
RACE, CLASS OR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT 135
performance of same police force by residents in different neighborhoods. This
line of studies focuses on differences in community culture and contexts, and
explores how macrolevel predictors of the neighborhoods can be related to
individuals' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with police. Neighborhood character-
istics that affect citizens' perceptions of police include racial composition,
socioeconomic status, residential mobility, and local crime and victimization
rates.
Racial composition and class
Compared to the research on individual racial and class background, the effects
of neighborhood racial composition and socioeconomic status are relatively
underresearched. A small number of studies reported a link between neighbor-
hood racial makeup and attitudes toward police (e.g., Apple & O'Brien, 1983;
Schuman & Gruenberg, 1972; Smith, Graham, & Adams, 1991; also see Frank
et al., 1996). Schuman and Gruenberg (1972), for instance, found that African
Americans' dissatisfaction with police decreases from all-Black, to most-Black,
to mixed and to most-White neighborhoods, whereas Whites' dissatisfaction
increases each step of the way from all-White to most-Black neighborhoods.
They claimed that "It is not color of skin, but color of area that is associated
with dissatisfaction" with police (p. 380). Similarly, Apple and O'Brien (1983)
found that African Americans' perceptions of the quality of police services
decline when percent African American in the neighborhood rises, but Whites'
perceptions are not significantly related to neighborhood rate of percent
African American (when perception of neighborhood safety is controlled),
suggesting a possible interaction between individual racial background and
neighborhood racial composition.
The interactive effects between neighborhood racial composition and class
have also been noted. For instance, Dunham and Alpert (1988) found that
residents of one middle-class and one lower-class predominantly Black neigh-
borhood generally held more negative attitudes toward police than those who
lived in the White neighborhood, but there were attitudinal variations between
Blacks in the two Black neighborhoods. They thus concluded that neighborhood
differences in attitudes toward police went beyond traditional racial distinc-
tions and that the main factors defining neighborhoods included both racial
make-up and socioeconomic status.
Based on data collected from three neighborhoods in Washington, DC,
Weitzer (1999) found that residents of the Black lower-class neighborhood are
more likely than those who lived in the Black middle-class and the White
middle-class neighborhoods to perceive or experience police abuse. Weitzer
concluded that the crucial factor in shaping public perception of police miscon-
duct is neighborhood class position, rather than individuals' class or neighbor-
hood racial composition. Similarly, neighborhood class status influences
residents' perceptions of police relations with their own versus other-race
136 WU ET AL.
neighborhoods, with residents in the Black middle-class neighborhood more
likely to perceive fair police treatment than those in the Black lower-class and
White middle-class neighborhoods (Weitzer, 2000).
The connection between neighborhood racial composition and class status is
most evident in recent research that has incorporated percent Black into the
scale of neighborhood class status. A common way to measure neighborhood
class is through the concept of concentrated disadvantage. Sampson and
Jeglum-Bartusch (1998) define concentrated disadvantage as representing an
economic disadvantage factor in racially segregated urban neighborhoods that
was characterized by percentages of Black, poverty, public assistance,
unemployment, female-headed families with children, and people under age
18. Reisig & Parks (2000) operationalize concentrated disadvantage using
percent Black, percent poor, percent labor force unemployed, and percent
female-headed households. Both studies found that concentrated disadvantage
is inversely related to satisfaction with police.
Residential mobility
Residential mobility is another important yet understudied factor. Research has
not established whether residential stability or mobility is associated with
residents' perceptions of the police for only a handful of studies have assessed
their connection. Sampson and Jeglum-Bartusch (1998) found that residential
mobility is not significantly related to satisfaction with police. Among individ-
ual-level analyses, Jesilow et al. (1995) showed no association between length
of residence and attitudes toward the police, while Zevitz and Rettammei
(1990) reported a positive link between length of residence and satisfaction
with police service among elderly. More research clearly is needed to test the
relationship between residential mobility and attitudes toward police.
Violent crime rates
Since most residents do not have direct contact with the police, public
perceptions of the police could also be a function of the real or perceived
crime problems within neighborhoods (Jacob, 1971). It has been found that
people who reside in high crime rate neighborhoods and people who are fear-
ful of crime in their neighborhoods tend to hold less positive views of police
(Parker, Onyekwuluje, & Komanduri, 1995; Percy, 1980; Reisig & Giacomazzi,
1998; Reisig & Parks, 2000; Smith et al., 1991). Reisig and Parks (2000) found
that homicide rate was inversely associated with satisfaction, but such a rela-
tionship was not statistically significant when concentrated disadvantage was
added into the model. This suggests that the effects of neighborhood crime
rates have been attenuated by concentrated disadvantage. In fact, crime rates
and concentrated disadvantage can be correlated with one another: Sampson
RACE, CLASS OR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT 137
and Jeglum-Bartusch (1998) found that violent crime rate is a significant
factor in explaining why residents of concentrated disadvantaged neighbor-
hoods are most dissatisfied with police.
The effects of crime rate on residents' satisfaction level with local police can
be explained in various ways. First, high crime rates heighten people's fear of
crime, and cast doubt on their confidence on the police's capability of effec-
tively performing crime control function. Second, more police officers are
assigned to areas with high crime rates. There might be more negative or
involuntary encounters between local residents and police occurring in these
areas, which lead to lower public satisfaction with police. Finally, higher crime
rates might lead to negative perceptions of police through the intervening
mechanism of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the quality of life. This is
especially true when the crime or disorder problem is seen as falling under the
purview of police (Jesilow et al., 1995).
Methods
Data source and sample
Data used in this study were collected as part of the project Informal Social
Control of Crime in High Drug Use Neighborhoods in Louisville and Lexington,
Kentucky, 2000. The project was originally designed to examine the effects of
cultural disorganization on informal social control, and the extent to which
these effects may be conditioned by the level of drug use in the neighborhood
(Warner, Leukefeld, & Kraman, 2002).
The data include two parts. Part 1 data were collected from face-to-face
(25 percent) and telephone interviews (75 percent) with households in 66 block
groups out of two urban communities, Louisville and Lexington, in Kentucky in
2000.2 A non-proportional stratified sampling of block groups was used to assure
a sufficient number of high drug use neighborhoods and an adequate distribu-
tion of predominantly White, predominantly racially mixed, and predominantly
minority neighborhoods. Within each block group, a systematic random
sampling method was used to select approximately 60 households from the
block group. The person interviewed in the household was the one who had
most recently had a birthday and who was at least 18 years old. Part 2 data used
in this study include aggregated variables from Part 1, as well as data from the
United States Census 1990, and the United States Census 2000 Population counts
(see Warner, 2003, 2007 for more information on the methodology used by the
original project). Cases with missing data were dropped from the analysis,
resulting in a final sample of 1,963 individuals nested within 66 neighborhoods.
2. The possible attitudinal differences across the two cities were examined. Residents in the two
cities do not differ significantly in their attitudes toward police. The variable city thus is not
included as an explanatory variable in the analysis.
138 WU ET AL.
Dependent variable
The dependent variable, satisfaction with police, is recoded as a dummy
variable with 1 representing satisfaction with police and 0 representing dissat-
isfaction with police. The variable is constructed from an additive scale
consisting of three items: "The police play an important role in preventing
crime in this neighborhood"; "The police do a good job in responding to people
in this neighborhood after they have been victims of crime"; and "Police are
generally helpful when dealing with people in this neighborhood." Response
categories include: 1 = strongly agree, 2 = somewhat agree, 3 = somewhat
disagree, and 4 = strongly disagree.3 The magnitude of internal consistency
indicates a high level of reliability (Cronbach's alpha = . 84). As is commonly
found respondents report a high degree of satisfaction with the police. In this
study, the scale was dichotomized because of the highly skewed nature even
after trying data transformation techniques.4 Those whose ratings in the scale
equal 6 or lower are coded as 1 meaning overall satisfaction, and those whose
ratings equal 7 or higher are coded as 0 meaning overall dissatisfaction. In this
manner only those who answered strongly agree on at least one of the vari-
ables or somewhat agree on all three variables were coded as being satisfied
overall.
Independent variables
The explanatory variables consist of both individual-level and neighborhood-level
predictors. The individual-level predictors include demographic characteristics
and individual crime and criminal justice experience. Demographic predictors
include race (0 = White, 1 = Black), class (0 = lower class, 1 = middle class), age
(measured in years) and gender5 (0 = male, 1 = female). The class variable was
constructed by combining three variables: education (0 = higher school degree or
lower, 1 = higher than high school degree), employment (0 = currently not
3. All three items thus have a range between 1 and 4 (1 = strongly agree and 4 = strongly disagree).
The first item (i.e., The police play an important role in preventing crime in this neighborhood) has
a mean of 1.70 and standard deviation .93, the second item (The police do a good job in responding
to people in the neighborhood after they have been victims of crime) has an average of 1.69 and
standard deviation .91, and the third item (police are generally helpful when dealing with people in
this neighborhood) has a mean of 1.58 and standard deviation .84.
4. A legitimate concern is that the collapse of the coding categories may cause a loss of information
content. To address this concern, we ran additional analysis using multinomial HLM models. The
results are largely similar to those from the Bernoulli HLM models, which justifies the use of a
dichotomous variable.
5. It should be noted that about two-thirds of the sample respondents are females. Several possible
explanations may account for a high percentage of female respondents in the sample. One is that
the sample block groups included a high number of high drug use neighborhoods with a high percent-
age of female-headed households. In these neighborhoods, women are more likely than men to be
surveyed. Another possible explanation is that females are more likely than males to be home
makers, which increases their possibility of being included. It is also possible that women are more
inclined than men to accept research requests.
RACE, CLASS OR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT 139
employed, 1 = currently employed), and home owner (0 = no, 1 = yes). Respon-
dents who have a higher than high school degree, who are currently employed,
and who are also home owners are coded as 1, representing middle class.6 The
rest are coded as 0, representing lower class. Crime and criminal justice
experience includes victimization (0 = no victimization experience over the past
three months, 1 = respondents or anyone in their household being a victim of a
crime over the past three months) and harassment experience with the police
(0 = no harassment experience in the past three months, 1 = respondents or
anyone in their household being harassed by the police over the past three
months).
The neighborhood-level predictors cover four neighborhood structural
characteristics--neighborhood racial composition, concentrated disadvantage,
residential mobility, and violent crime rate. Based on the classification used by
past research (e.g., Sun & Payne, 2004), neighborhoods are divided into three
types: predominantly White (over 80 percent of residents are Whites), predomi-
nantly African American (over 80 percent of residents are African Americans),
and racially mixed (neither White residents nor African American residents
exceed 80 percent of the neighborhood population). Among the 66 sample
neighborhoods, 19 (29 percent) are predominantly White, 18 (27 percent) are
predominantly African American, and the remaining 29 (44 percent) are racially
mixed. For the purpose of this analysis, predominantly White neighborhoods are
used as the comparison group, thus only predominantly African American and
racially mixed are entered into the neighborhood-level analysis.
The measure of concentrated disadvantage is obtained from a factor analysis
of the following three 1990 census items7: the percentage of residents that
were living under the poverty line, the percentage of labor force that was
unemployed, and the percentage of families with children that were headed by
single women. The factor has an eigenvalue of 2.37 and explains nearly 80
percent of the variance across the three items. Factor loadings range from .85
to .91. The factor of concentrated disadvantage is affected most by the poverty
rate, followed by unemployment rate and female-headed household rate.
6. The percentage distributions for all three items are: 51.3 percent of the respondents have a
higher than high school degree, 20.3 percent are currently employed, and 49.2 percent own a home.
It should be noted that the construction of the individual-level class variable is slightly different
from that of the neighborhood-level class variable (i.e., concentrated disadvantage) since the
dataset does not contain information on individual family's income. One may also argue that requir-
ing a "yes" response on all three items may underestimate the percentage of middle class. An alter-
native explanation for the high percent of lower class individuals found in this study is that the
sampling plan for this study was developed to assure a sufficient number of high drug use neighbor-
hoods. In such a sample, it would be expected that the socioeconomic status of the respondents
would be lower than that expected in a representative sample.
7. The 2000 census data were not used to construct structural characteristics because the dataset,
which was obtained directly from ICPSR, did not include the 2000 Census data. The failure of the
original researchers to include data from the 2000 Census is probably because when the original
data were collected in 2000, the 2000 Census data were not available. Since there is no identifier
for each specific sample block group in the data set, adding data from the 2000 Census into the
dataset is impossible.
140 WU ET AL.
Originally, factor analysis was conducted to build up the scale of concentrated
disadvantage with four factors--poverty rate, female-headed household rate,
unemployment rate, and percent Black. Percent African American was found to
have the lowest factor loading (.73). Together with our theoretical consider-
ation, it was decided to take percent African American out and use it as an inde-
pendent level-2 predictor.
Residential mobility is measured as is traditional in social disorganization
research by the percentage of residents who have lived in the neighborhood
for less than five years. Neighborhood violence crime rate is measured by the
average violent crime counts per thousand people per year in the neighbor-
hood. We used police reports on violent crime counts in each neighborhood
during 1997, 1998, and 1999, which cover homicide, assault, rape and
robbery. Descriptive statistics for variables used in this analysis are shown in
Table 1.
Possible multicollinearity problems were examined for among the six level-1
predictors and the four level-2 predictors. The highest correlation is between
concentrated disadvantage and residential mobility (r = .56), which is tolerable.
The correlation matrices for the variables are presented in Table 2.
Analysis
The analysis included two main parts. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was
the primary modeling procedure used in the first part. It enabled us to exam-

ine the relative effects of individual race and class and neighborhood racial
composition and class level in determining citizens' satisfaction with police.
The program used was HLM 6.02. Due to the binary nature of the outcome
variable, we used a Bernoulli sampling model with logit link instead of the
standard level-1 linear regression model. The dependent variable is the prob-
ability that a resident will report of being satisfied with police work. The
analysis began with estimating an unconditional model with no predictors at
either level, followed by the conditional models. In the first step, individual-
level predictors were added into the level-1 model to see if there is still
substantial variation among the neighborhoods. Next, neighborhood-level vari-
ables were added into the level-2 model, one by one. In these models, the
level-1 unit of analysis is the individual, while the level-2 unit of analysis is
the neighborhood.
In the second part of the analysis, the neighborhoods were divided accord-
ing to their social-economic status (i.e., the level of concentrated disadvan-
tage). Then, logistic regressions were run in both "low disadvantaged
neighborhoods" and "high disadvantaged neighborhoods," using all individual-
level independent variables. After that, comparisons were made between the
corresponding coefficients in the two regressions. The main purpose of this
part is to examine the inter-racial gap in satisfaction with police across low
disadvantaged neighborhoods and high disadvantaged neighborhoods. This part
of analysis is complementary to the first part because in the HLM analysis,
only the intercept function is used as the outcome variable to reduce the
complexity of the model, thus there is no test of the interactive effects of
individual-level and neighborhood-level predictors. By doing this second part
analysis, how the slopes (i.e., the effects of race and class on satisfaction)
vary across neighborhoods with distinctive social-economic status could be
assessed.

Hierarchical linear models
Unconditional model
The purpose of estimating an unconditional model was to gauge the magnitude
of variation between neighborhoods in the probability of their residents to be
satisfied with police. Given a Bernoulli sampling model and a logit link function,
the level-1 model is simply
and the level-2 model is
where i indexes individuals and j indexes neighborhoods. ij is the probability
that respondent i from neighborhood j is satisfied with police. 0,0 is the
average log-odds of satisfaction with police across the 66 neighborhoods, while
00 is the variance between neighborhoods in their average log-odds of satisfac-
tion. The disturbance u0,j is assumed to be random normal with a mean of 0 and
variance of 00. The estimated results are 0,0 = 1.578 (SE = .095), 00 = .348.
Thus, for a neighborhood with a "typical" satisfaction level, that is, for a neigh-
borhood with a random effect u0,j = 0, the expected log-odds of satisfaction is
1.578, corresponding to an odds of exp{1.578} = 4.843. This corresponds to a
probability of 4.843 / (1 + 4.843) = .829. Therefore, the "typical" satisfaction
level in these neighborhoods is very high--about 83 out of 100 chances that
respondents would rate police performance as satisfactory.
Meanwhile, we would expect that about 95 percent of the neighborhoods should
have the values of 0,j between 1.578 ± 1.96 × .3481/2 = (.422, 2.734). Converting
these log-odds to probabilities, it turns out that 95 percent of the neighborhoods
lie between (.604, .939) with respect to its residents' probability of satisfaction
with police. As a result, there exists adequate variation between different neigh-
borhoods in their residents' average level of satisfaction with police8--in certain
neighborhoods, the average possibility that the residents rate police work as satis-
factory is only about 60 percent, while in others, it is as high as 94 percent.9
8. We ran additional analysis using the uncollapsed scale as the dependent variable and the results
do support our statement on adequate variation among neighborhoods. For example, the average
possibility that the residents rate police work as satisfactory is about 55 percent in certain neighbor-
hoods, while it is as high as 95 percent in others. These results are in line with those from the esti-
mation using the dichotomous dependent variable.
9. Because of the nature of nonlinear link functions, we do not report the intraclass correlation
(i.e., the ratio of level-2 variance to the total variation). Though it is a useful index in a standard
two-level HLM, this measure is less informative in the case of Bernoulli sampling, because the level-
1 variance now is heteroscedastic (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).

Conditional models with level-1 predictors
Model 1 included all the level-1 predictors. We estimated the log of public
satisfaction with police as a function of race, class, age, gender, victimization,
and harassment experience. Among them, race, class, gender, victimization,
and previous harassment experience are uncentered, while age is group-
centered.10 Specifically, the level-1 model becomes:
At level 2, only the intercept term is treated as randomly varied across the
neighborhoods.11
The results are presented in Table 3, model 1. For White, middle class,
middle-aged males whose family members did not have any victimization or
harassment experience in the past 3 months, the average log-odds of satisfac-
tion with police is 00 = 1.928. The log-odds is lower for African Americans,
10 = -.427, and such racial difference is statistically significant. This means
that being an African American reduces the odds of satisfaction with police by
about 35 percent. Being middle class has a positive impact on the log-odds of
satisfaction (20 = .402, p = .019). The odds for a middle class resident to be
satisfied with police are almost 50 percent higher than those for a lower class
resident. Age is positively associated with a higher log-odds of satisfaction,
30 = .031, holding constant other predictors in the model. When age increases
by one year, the estimated odds of satisfaction with police multiply by 1.032;
that is, they increase by 3.2 percent, which is quite significant. Females are
slightly less likely to be satisfied with police than males, but the difference is
not significant.
Both previous victimization and police harassment experience turn out to be
significant predictors of residents' ratings of police performance. Being a crime
victim or having a family member as a crime victim reduces the odds of being
satisfied with police by approximately 34 percent. Even more significant, being
harassed or having a family member being harassed by police substantially
decreases the odds of satisfaction with police by 67 percent, controlling for all
other individual indicators. Previous harassment experience appears to have the
strongest predictive power among level-1 predictors.
The variance component drops from .349 in the unconditional model to .176
(2 = 115.538, df = 65, p < .001) in the conditional model 1, suggesting that
10. Group-mean centering means that we centered age by substracting its corresponding level-2
unit mean from each individual's actual age, so that the intercept 0j becomes the expected
outcome for a subject whose age is in the average level of their neighborhood. This facilitates
interpretation of the variable when it becomes the outcome variable in the level-2 model. This
approach also tends to reduce multicollinearity.
11. Because of the large number of level-one predictors, we turn off the disturbance terms for
slopes (from 1j to 6j), to reduce the complexity of the model and to make it easier for the
computer program to calculate the variance and covariance.

there is still substantial variation among neighborhoods after introducing all
these individual characteristics and experiences. Therefore, the next step is to
add neighborhood-level variables into the model to explain this variation.
Conditional models with level-1 and level-2 predictors
The between-neighborhood models analyze four factors measured at the
macrolevel: neighborhood racial composition, concentrated disadvantage,
residential mobility, and violent crime rate. Except for racial composition, all
variables are entered into the model after grand-mean centering. The level-1
model remains the same, and the level-2 model is written as:
Since the factors are entered one by one (except for the two racial composition
measures which are entered simultaneously), four hierarchical linear models
were estimated. They are all intercepts-as-outcomes models because our inter-
est at this stage is in modeling satisfaction averages with police removing the
effects of all individual-level characteristics, rather than in the slopes.12
The results were presented in Table 3, models 2 to 5. Model 2 indicates that
residents in predominantly African American neighborhoods and racially mixed
neighborhoods are significantly less likely to rate police work as satisfactory
compared to those who live in predominantly White neighborhoods. Note that
when racial composition is added into the model, race at the individual level is
no longer significant. The effects of other individual-level predictors remain
largely the same. By adding racial composition of the neighborhood, the
variance component has decreased to .104 (2 = 94.331, df = 63, p = .007). This
means that neighborhood racial composition can explain approximately 41
percent [(.176 ­ .104) / .176] of the variation across the neighborhoods in terms
of the outcome variable.
Model 3 shows that concentrated disadvantage is inversely associated with
residents' levels of satisfaction with police. Specifically, with one unit increase
in the measure of concentrated disadvantage, the average odds of satisfaction
with police drops by about 24 percent (1 - .76). Thus the effect of concentrated
disadvantage is both statistically and substantially significant. Note that when
concentrated disadvantage is entered into the model, at the individual level,
class is no longer a significant predictor. At the neighborhood level, the signifi-
cant difference between predominantly White neighborhoods and mixed
12. Before adding in neighborhood-level characteristics, we did run a model that enables slopes of
all individual-level predictors to vary randomly. The results show that the impact of the individual-
level predictors on the outcome variable did not vary significantly at the .05 level across neighbor-
hoods. We thus model 0j as a function of the level-2 predictors, and view other level-1 coefficients,
pj, p > 0, as fixed.

neighborhoods no longer exists, while the gap between predominantly White
neighborhoods and predominantly African American neighborhoods is still quite
significant. The variance component decreases from .104 to .049 (2 = 79.343,
df = 62, p = .068), indicating that concentrated disadvantage can explain
approximately 53 percent of the remaining variation among different neighbor-
hoods in their average levels of satisfaction with police.
Model 4 adds residential mobility as another neighborhood-level predictor. The
findings indicate that the higher residential mobility, the lower probability that
residents would rate local police performance as satisfactory (mobility = -.98,
SE = .48, p = .044). Meanwhile, by adding residential mobility, the effects of
concentrated disadvantage on the outcome variable has been attenuated signif-
icantly (concentrated disadvantage= -.15, SE = .11, p =.184). Results from the final
estimation of variance components show that adding residential mobility reduces
the variance component to .022 (2 = 75.182, df = 61, p = .105), suggesting a
moderate degree of model improvement. Together, racial composition, concen-
trated disadvantage and residential mobility can explain as much as 87.5 percent
of the interneighborhood difference in terms of the outcome variable. The
remaining variation between neighborhoods only approaches significant at the .1
level. Nonetheless, the decision was made to add one more level-2 predictor, the
neighborhood violent crime rate, into the model, because it is a theoretically
important variable and might cause significant changes in other variables'
explanatory power.
Holding all other predictors constant, neighborhood violent crime rate is nega-
tively associated with the log-odds of satisfaction with police (violence= -.01,
SE = .00, p = .040). Neighborhoods with high levels of violence crime rates tend
to have low satisfaction with police. The influences of all other predictors remain
more or less the same as those from previous models. A slight decrease occurs in
the effects of predominantly African American neighborhoods on residents' satis-
faction with police, although people who live in predominantly African American
neighborhoods are still significantly less likely to have favorable attitudes toward
police. Neighborhood violence level, together with other neighborhood-level
predictors, contributes approximately 92 percent of the variation across
neighborhoods in terms of the outcome variable. The variance component
decreases further to .014 (2 = 72.822, df = 60, p = .124), indicating a slight
model improvement. This is the final model.
From this final model, we can see that overall satisfaction level with police is
high. The grand mean (i.e., the intercept) is 2.21 (0,0 = 2.21, SE = .25, p < .001),
suggesting that the log-odds of satisfaction with police for a White, lower class,
middle-aged male with no previous victimization or harassment experience who
lives in a neighborhood with predominantly White residents, average concen-
trated disadvantage level, average residential mobility level, and average
violent crime rate is 2.21. The odds ratio equals 9.07, meaning that the odds of
satisfaction with police are about nine times greater than the odds of dissatisfac-
tion, controlling for all predictors. Therefore, the respondents are much more
likely to express satisfaction with police.

Logistic regression models
In the second part of the analysis, the data were portioned by neighborhood
social-economic status and tested for potential different patterns of results for
residents in low disadvantaged neighborhoods versus in high disadvantaged
neighborhoods. Results from the previous HLM analysis indicated that concen-
trated disadvantage was not a significant predictor of satisfaction after control-
ling for neighborhood racial composition, residential mobility and violent crime
rate. In this study concentrated disadvantage and residential mobility are
moderately (r = .56) correlated with each other. This means that the explana-
tory power of the former could be somewhat attenuated by adding the latter.
For this reason, the 66 neighborhoods were evenly divided into half according to
their levels of disadvantage and examined specifically for whether or not resi-
dents in neighborhoods of different social-economic status vary in terms of the
relationship between individual-level predictors and satisfaction with police
that exist within them.
The results, presented in Table 4, show that neighborhood social-economic
status does influence individual residents satisfaction with the police. The effect
of a resident's race on satisfaction with police is conditional on neighborhood
socioeconomic status. In low disadvantaged neighborhoods, African Americans
and Whites differ significantly in their attitudes toward police, with Blacks
holding less favorable attitudes. In high disadvantaged neighborhoods, African
Americans and Whites display similar views toward police. Meanwhile, in low

disadvantaged neighborhoods, a middle class resident is 1.5 times more likely to
be satisfied with police than a lower class resident, which is toward significant
at the .05 level. Social class, however, has no such impact at all in high disad-
vantaged neighborhoods. Another difference exists in the effects of previous
victimization experience. It is interesting to observe that previous victimization
experience has a much stronger negative impact on citizens' satisfaction with
police in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods than in less disadvantaged ones.
In brief, the results of the logistic regressions reveal inter-racial differences
in public satisfaction with police. Though overall African American residents are
less likely than White residents to view police work as satisfactory, such inter-
racial gap only exists significantly in less disadvantaged neighborhoods. In highly
disadvantaged neighborhoods, residents, regardless of their race, hold similar,
less favorable attitudes toward police.
Discussion
This study represents an attempt to empirically test the effects of individual
characteristics, especially race and class, personal and vicarious experiences,
and neighborhood contexts on residents' satisfaction with police. The results
support a comprehensive framework that takes into account both individual and
neighborhood explanations of satisfaction with the police. A general finding is
that individual background characteristics and experiences appear to be signifi-
cant predictors of attitudes toward the police at the single-level analysis,
whereas neighborhood contexts, along with personal experiences, show better
explanatory power at the multilevel analysis.
Specifically, perhaps the most important conclusion is that neighborhood
characteristics are important in predicting satisfaction with the police and that
research that ignores the neighborhood-level influence is incomplete. Three
major findings from the study lead to this conclusion. First, while the connec-
tion between race and evaluation of local police is well established, residents'
satisfaction with police is not accounted for only by their race but is signifi-
cantly affected by neighborhood racial composition. It was found that African
Americans are significantly more likely than Whites to rate police work as
unsatisfactory only when neighborhood contextual factors are not controlled.
Once neighborhood characteristics, such as racial composition, are held
constant, the effect of race becomes non-significant. This finding is similar to
those of Reisig and Parks (2000) and Sampson and Jeglum-Bartusch (1998).
Second, in terms of class, the findings support past research that shows a
positive connection between individuals' social class and their perceptions of
police. However, the impact of individual class does not persist when neighbor-
hood class level is included in the analysis, suggesting that it is neighborhood
class status, rather than individual class status, that matters more in measuring
satisfaction with police. This finding echoes the results from a handful of
previous studies (i.e., Dunham & Alpert, 1988; Weitzer, 1999, 2000). Moreover,
150 WU ET AL.
neighborhood class level is also pivotal in conditioning the effect of individual
racial background on satisfaction with police. In socially disadvantaged neigh-
borhoods African Americans and Whites display similar attitudes toward police,
whereas in socially advantaged neighborhoods African Americans are more likely
than Whites to have negative attitudes toward police. This implies that research
clearly needs to take neighborhood class status into consideration when assess-
ing inter-racial differences in attitudes toward police.
Third, racial composition, concentrated disadvantage, residential mobility,
and violence crime rate are all good neighborhood-level predictors in determin-
ing public perception of police. Comparatively, the impact of racial composition
is stronger than that of class level, indicating the primacy of aggregate-level
measures of race in explaining satisfaction with police. Overall, the findings
reveal the importance of considering neighborhood explanations and continuing
to use interneighborhood predictors in future studies because they provide
theoretical foundations and account for a substantial amount of variation across
neighborhoods in residents' satisfaction with police.
Extending these findings to a broader level, while some researchers argue
that the importance of racial status is diminishing in the lives of Americans in
general (Wilson, 1987) and in predicting citizen satisfaction with the police in
particular (Jesilow et al., 1995), the results of this research show that
Americans are largely divided by race and class in their attitudes toward the
police. This finding, which signals the social distance between White and Black
and between the rich and poor, supports Hacker's (1992) argument that the
nation is moving toward two societies--one Black, one White, separate and
unequal. Even after the civil rights movement and three decades of affirmative
action and police reform, it seems that the legacy of social inequality still has
an enduring effect on public perceptions of the police (Browning & Cao, 1992).
Beyond the importance of neighborhood are other key findings. First, individ-
ual crime and criminal justice experiences are highly predictive of satisfaction
with police. The findings indicate that personal or family members' experiences
of victimization or harassment by police have a negative influence on residents'
evaluations of local police performance. This fining is consistent with the results
from research on procedural justice. As mentioned earlier, this vein of studies
posits that citizens' evaluations of police are heavily shaped by whether they
perceive criminal justice agencies as fair and equitable in both the procedures
for making decisions and the outcomes of the decisions (Tyler, 1990; Tyler &
Degoey, 1995). Indeed, citizens are more likely to have higher levels of satisfac-
tion with police when they feel that the decision of the police results from just
procedures.
Second, although age was used as a control variable, it is found to be a
consistently significant predictor and better than any other demographic char-
acteristic in predicting variation in citizens' satisfaction with police. This result
is congruent with the findings from several previous studies that stress the
importance of age in shaping citizens' satisfaction with police (Hurst & Frank,
2000; Peek et al., 1981; Weitzer & Tuch, 2002; Wilson, 1985).
RACE, CLASS OR NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT 151
The findings of this study have several implications for future research. First,
future studies should incorporate other individual-level variables, such as citi-
zens' perceptions of the quality of their lives, into the within-neighborhood
model. Reisig and Parks (2000) found that variables measuring "quality of life"
are significant predictors of satisfaction with police at the individual level. They
argued that it was not just objective neighborhood structural characteristics
that influence public perception of police--the "cognitive and emotionally
based responses to neighborhood conditions" might matter more (Reisig &
Parks, 2000, p. 625). We agree. Originally, the researchers attempted to include
disorder, indicated by both social disorder and physical disorder, into the level-
2 model to test whether or not the aggregated quality of life would impact
individual perception. It turned out that the disorder measures were almost
perfectly correlated with violence measures, so they were dropped. Future
research should include measures of perception of neighborhood disorder or the
quality of life into the analysis of satisfaction with police.
Second, more studies should be conducted to examine exactly how previous
victimization experiences influence satisfaction with police. The findings
indicate consistent significant effects of victimization and harassment on
satisfaction with police. While the latter is quite easy to understand, the former
needs more elaboration. Does gender, race or class have any impact on the
relationship between victimization and satisfaction with police? Or, do factors
other than victims' demographic characteristics, such as the types of crime and
the ways victims are handled, have greater influences? More theorizing work
needs to be done on victimization, and mere quantitative analysis is not enough.
Third, future studies should also pay attention to the construction of neigh-
borhood-level factors. Two questions are important to ask. One, what are the
best indicators for "concentrated disadvantage?" Recall that factor analysis was
conducted to build up the scale of concentrated disadvantage with four
factors--poverty rate, female-headed household rate, unemployment rate, and
percent Black. Percent African American was found to have the lowest factor
loading. It was dropped from the scale and used as an independent level-2
predictor. This way of constructing concentrated disadvantage proved impor-
tant for this study. The findings suggest that this would also be appropriate in
other cities with middle class, predominantly African American neighborhoods
where conventional lifestyles and criminal lifestyles are closely integrated
(Pattillo, 1998). In these neighborhoods, the most important indicator of
concentrated disadvantage is not racial composition, but class level.
The second question is: what is the relationship among these neighborhood
predictors? Do neighborhood structural characteristics, such as concentrated
disadvantage, lead to high rates of violence crime, which, in turn, result in
lower levels of satisfaction with police? It would be useful if hierarchical linear
modeling and structural equation modeling could be combined. In addition,
what is the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and residential
mobility? In this sample, they are correlated with one another in a moderately
high manner--is this also the case for other neighborhoods?

Citizen satisfaction with the police remains an critical issue for police admin-
istrators during the postera of community policing or the information technol-
ogy era where geo-based crime prevention and fighting strategies and tactics
become essential in performing a new model of policing that is mainly driven by
data and technology (Rosenbaum, 2007). In this sense, understanding of neigh-
borhood-based attitudes toward the police and specific neighborhood charac-
teristics that shape resident attitudes represents key data or information for
police managers to enhance public participation in crime prevention programs
and police-community relations.
Our findings also have other important implications for policy. First, given
that younger residents are less likely than elderly residents to be satisfied with
local police, efforts should be made to improve police activity toward this group
of individuals. For police departments, one of the keys is to increase positive
contacts and reduce negative contacts between younger citizens and police.
Positive contacts could be cultivated through field training programs and
community policing programs, such as citizen police academy and school
resource officers, whereas negative contacts could be reduced by avoiding
overly aggressive enforcement and fairly applying of justice.
Second, police departments need to seek ways to improve their services to
crime victims, who have consistently shown a higher level of dissatisfaction with
police. According to past research, victims' negative perceptions of police come
mainly from two sources: they blame police for failing to prevent the crime and
perceive that officers treat them with complete indifference. It would be hard
to stop citizens complaining about crime prevention or victimization, but it is
feasible to require officers to display polite behaviors and gracious manners in
their contacts with victims. Police administrators should constantly cultivate a
compassionate understanding of human suffering or the so-called "tragic
perspective" (Muir, 1977) among officers to enhance victims' satisfaction with
police.
Finally, our findings indicate that variation in neighborhood contexts influ-
ences residents' evaluations of local police. Policymakers and practitioners thus
should continue to work together to build up positive physical and social capital
for highly disadvantaged neighborhoods. Physical capital could be strengthened
by attending to quality of life issues, increasing neighborhood opportunity struc-
tures, and implementing better environmental design, while social capital could
be enhanced by promoting community networks and cohesion, decreasing social
disorganization and crime, and attracting external capital-building institutions
(White, 2006). Police departments should actively participate in community-
building and crime-prevention programs, and hopefully this kind of involvement
would lead to higher levels of satisfaction with police.
