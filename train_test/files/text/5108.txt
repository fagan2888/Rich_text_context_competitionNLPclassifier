Introduction
Excessive sympathetic drive is undoubtedly a major con-
tributing factor to the pathophysiology of hypertension,1
heart failure,2,3 end-stage renal disease,4,5 and many other
chronic cardiovascular diseases.6 Additionally, the critical
role of the circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS),
which is activated by plasma renin, in the regulation of
blood pressure (BP) and sodium homeostasis has been rec-
ognized for many years. Much of the excessive sympa-
thetic drive in these conditions is directed to the kidney,
where it leads to inappropriate sodium retention, renin
stimulation, and diminished renal function.7 Accumulating
evidence showed that the sympathetic nervous system
(SNS) and RAS were overexcited and interacted in car-
diovascular pathophysiological conditions mentioned
above.8 Therefore, treatment of the elevated SNS and RAS
activity would be anticipated to provide significant clinical
benefit.

Abstract
Introduction: Excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
are crucial and interacted closely in the pathogenesis of chronic cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the
effects of renal denervation (RDN) on the RAS.
Materials and methods: Eight Chinese Kunming dogs underwent bilateral RDN utilizing saline-irrigated radiofre-
quency ablation catheter. Blood pressure (BP) measurements, blood sampling assays and renal angiography were per-
formed at baseline, 30 min, one month and three months after ablation.
Results: During three months of follow-up, RDN caused a significant and uniform reduction in plasma level of renin,
angiotensin II, and endothelin-1(ET-1), with the reduction of ­5.7±6.8 (p=0.049), ­19.4±19.3 (p=0.025), and ­22.4±21
pg/ml (p=0.02) for plasma renin, ­10.6±7.2 (p=0.004), ­15.9±8.8 (p=0.001), and ­15.2±9.6 pg/ml (p=0.003) for plasma
angiotensin II, as well as ­3.9±3 (p=0.007), ­10.8±5 (p<0.001), and ­14.6±6.1 pg/ml (p<0.001) for plasma ET-1. RDN
utilizing a saline-irrigated catheter also caused a progressive and substantial BP reduction of ­19±22/­8±13, ­30±13/­
13±14, and ­36±20/­16±14 mm Hg (p=0.045, p<0.001, and p<0.002 for systolic BP; p=0.14, p=0.036, and p=0.014 for
diastolic BP) without ablation-related complications.
Conclusion: RDN substantially decreased BP and also significantly decreased the plasma levels of RAS and ET-1, which
might be implicated in the mechanism of BP reduction by RDN.

Recently, renal denervation (RDN) using a catheter-
based approach, which targets at disrupting renal afferent
and efferent nerves thereby attenuating sympathetic nerv-
ous activity, is well-known as an innovative method for
drug-resistant hypertension.9 The results of the Symplicity
HTN-1 study (a nonrandomized proof-of-concept study)
showed that RDN was a feasible, effective, and safe method
for drug-resistant hypertension.10 Subsequently, the
Symplicity HTN-2 study (a randomized clinical trial)
showed BP in the RDN group reduced substantially more
than that in medication-only group.11 More recently, longer-
term follow-up of the Symplicity HTN-1 and HTN-2 stud-
ies showed RDN offered safe and sustained reduction of BP
to at least one or two years.12,13 Other than its effect of
marked and sustained BP reduction, many studies also
found muscle sympathetic nervous activity, renal norepi-
nephrine spillover, and plasma renin levels decreased in
patients who underwent RDN.14,15 With this in mind, one of
the major underlying mechanisms of RDN on BP reduction
may be its decreased effect on the SNS and RAS. However,
data related to the details of the effects of RDN on RAS
activity are not reported. Furthermore, many studies have
indicated that angiotensin II is a potent stimulator of
endothelin-1 (ET-1) production and exerts its hypertensive
effects via interaction with the ET system.16­19 Based on
these considerations, we carried out a pilot study investi-
gating the effect of RDN on RAS activity and ET-1, and
explored the mechanism of BP reduction by RSD.
Methods
Animal preparation
All of experiments were approved by the animal experi-
mentation ethics committee of Chongqing Medical
University, following the guidelines of the National
Institutes of Health for the care and use of laboratory ani-
mals. Standard food and water were given throughout the
experimental period.
This study was performed on 10 healthy adult Chinese
Kunming dogs of either sex, weight between 30­35 kg. The
Chinese Kunming dogs are larger, more aggressive and
fierce than beagles, spaniels and mongrels, with naturally
high BP and sympathetic activity, and were the optimal
experimental animals used for this study. Eligible Kunming
dogs were older than three years and had a systolic BP of
140 mm Hg or more.
On the day of experiment, the Kunming dogs were
generally anesthetized with 3% sodium pentobarbital of
30 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection, followed by a
maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg per hour. Penicillin was
given intramuscularly before and after the ablation for the
prevention of infection. The right femoral artery and vein
were punctured under sterile conditions, then 8F and 6F
sheaths were placed, respectively. An amount of 2000 IU
unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously
for anticoagulation. Blood sampling was obtained from
right femoral vein and BP was monitored via the right
femoral artery by connecting to the pressure transducer
device before and 30 min after the ablation.
Renal angiogram and renal artery ablation
Bilateral renal angiography was performed using 6F JR4
Judkins catheter (Cordis Corporation Miami, Florida, USA).
If renal artery abnormalities were found or diameters were
below the minimum tolerable size (<4 mm, using the inner
diameter of 6F JR4 Judkins catheter as reference), the
Kunming dog was eliminated from the study. After confir-
mation of eligibility, bilateral RDN was performed with a
saline-irrigated catheter (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar,
California, USA). The catheter was positioned into each
renal artery via femoral access, and then 8­12 watts radiofre-
quency energy was applied both longitudinally and rotation-
ally within the main stem of the renal arteries. Up to eight
ablations were performed in each renal artery and ablative
time for each point lasted up to 60­90 s. The temperature of
tissue-electrode interface was maintained to 40°C by saline
irrigated manually during the ablation procedure. After the
ablation procedure, the angiography was redone to evaluate
the morphology of renal artery, and also for the documenta-
tion of vessel patency and intact kidney perfusion.
Blood sampling assays
Before, 30 min, one month, and three months after ablation,
respectively, 3 ml of blood sampling to measure plasma
levels of renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1 was obtained in
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) from the right
femoral vein. After high speed centrifugation, the blood
samples were stored at ­80°C until assay. The plasma lev-
els of renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1 were assayed by
radioimmunoassay.
Follow-up assessment
During the follow-up period, the condition of all Kunming
dogs was observed daily.After the ablation procedure of one
month and three months, follow-up assessments were con-
ducted, which consisted of BP measurements via femoral
artery, bilateral renal arterial angiography, and plasma levels
of renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1 assay, as described above.
Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as mean±standard deviation (SD).
Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to compare BP, plasma levels of renin, angiotensin II,
and ET-1 from baseline to 30 min, one month, and three
months. A least significant difference (LSD)-t test was used
for intergroup comparison. The relationship between
plasma level of renin and angiotensin II, as well as plasma
534 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
level of angiotensin II and ET-1 were assessed by Pearson
correlation analysis. A two-sided p<0.05 was regarded as
statistically significant. All of the statistical analyses were
performed with SPSS statistical software (version17.0,
Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Results
Ten Kunming dogs in preparation for RDN underwent
renal angiography, but two Kunming dogs were excluded
for anatomical reason (due to dual renal artery system). The
remaining eight Kunming dogs underwent RDN and com-
pleted three months of follow-up.
Plasma renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1
The changes of plasma level of renin, angiotensin II, and
ET-1 are presented in Figure 1. Repeated measuresANOVA
testing showed that plasma levels of renin, angiotensin II,
and ET-1 were significantly lower after the procedure than
before the procedure (p=0.019 for renin, p=0.001 for angio-
tensin II, and p<0.001 for ET-1). Compared to those at

baseline, RDN decreased plasma renin from 67.57±15.63
pg/ml to 61.88±13.30 pg/ml (p=0.049), 48.41±10.97 pg/ml
(p=0.025), and 45.21±9.87 pg/ml (p=0.02), respectively.
Consistent with the changes of renin, plasma angiotensin II
fell from 54.07±11.75 pg/ml to 43.45±6.83 pg/ml,
38.22±6.24 pg/ml, and 38.88±6.62 pg/ml (p=0.004, 0.001
and 0.003, respectively). Additionally, plasma ET-1
decreased from an average of 28.8±6.75 pg/ml at baseline
to 24.89±6.16 pg/ml, 17.98±7.04 pg/ml and 14.16±5.8 pg/
ml at 30 min, one month, and three months of follow-up
(p=0.007, p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively).
The Kunming dogs underwent RDN exhibited lower
plasma renin, angiotensin II and ET-1 levels at 30 min after
procedure, were further reduced at one month, and per-
sisted through subsequent assessments up to three months
(Figure 2). Mean reductions in plasma renin were
­5.7±6.8,­19.4±19.3, and ­22.4±21 pg/ml, in plasma angi-
otensin II were ­10.6±7.2, ­15.9±8.8, and ­15.2±9.6 pg/
ml, and in plasma ET-1 were ­3.9±3,­10.8±5, and
­14.6±6.1 pg/ml, respectively. The progressive and sus-
tained reduction of plasma level of renin was consistent
with angiotensin II and ET-1 from baseline to three-month
follow-up. Following Pearson correlation analysis, we
found that plasma level of renin correlated closely with
plasma level of angiotensin II (r=0.757, p<0.001, Figure 3).
In addition, There was a significant linear relationship
between plasma level of angiotensin II and ET-1 (r=0.712,
p<0.001, Figure 3).
BP
Systolic/diastolic BP was 160±19/98±15, 141±19/91±10,
130±13/86±13, and 124±9/82±6 mm Hg at baseline, 30
min, one month, and three months after the procedure,
respectively. The repeated measures ANOVA test showed
that both systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly
lower after procedure than before procedure (p<0.001 for
systolic and p=0.02 for diastolic BP). Following the LSD-t
test, at all time points after procedure, both systolic and
diastolic BPs were significantly lower than baseline BP,
with the exception of the 30-minute diastolic BP (p=0.045,
p<0.001 and p<0.002 for systolic BP; p=0.14, p=0.036 and
p=
0.014 for diastolic BP, respectively; Figure 4). RDN
reduced BP at 30 min, one month and three months by
­19±22/­8±13, ­30±13/­13±14, and ­36±20/­16±14 mm
Hg, respectively.
Renal angiogram
There was no evidence of renal artery dissection, stenosis
or other abnormalities occurring in the Kunming dogs
which underwent RDN, either during the procedure and
follow-up period. Renal angiographic studies identified
focal artery irregularities immediately after radiofrequency
energy delivery, none of which were judged as flow limit-
ing at procedure termination (Figure 5(b)). One-month fol-
low-up angiograms showed that almost all ablated lesions
had disappeared and the renal artery wall had recovered
smoothly (Figure 5(c)).
Discussion
The main findings of the current study were as follows: (a)
RDN caused a substantial and uniform reduction in plasma
levels of renin, angiotensin II, and ET-1; (b) there was a
significant linear relationship between plasma level of
renin and angiotensin II, as well as plasma level of angio-
tensin II and ET-1; (c) RDN utilizing saline-irrigated

without ablation-related complications; (d) repeat angio-
grams showed that focal artery irregularities immediately
after radiofrequency energy delivery all disappeared after
one month.
Effects of RDN on RAS activity and ET-1
Previous research studies proved that SNS and RAS acti-
vation are crucial and interact closely in the pathogenesis
of cardiorenal diseases. They showed that renal sympa-
thetic nerves terminate on various elements in the kidney,
including the vessels, renal tubules, and juxtaglomerular
granular cells.20 Based on this consideration, many cardio-
renal diseases changing renal sympathetic nerve activity
(RSNA) could directly influence the functions of inner-
vated renal effector units. Increases in RSNA raise plasma
RAS levels by stimulating renin release from 1-
adrenoreceptors on juxtaglomerular granular cells, decrease
urinary sodium and water excretion by increasing renal
tubular water and sodium reabsorption through the nephron,
and decrease glomerular filtration rate by constricting the
renal vasculature: in turn this contributes to the develop-
ment of cardiorenal diseases.21,22

Many -adrenoreceptors blockers can reduce plasma
renin activity in patients and experimental animals,23,24 and
are found to be more effective in patients with higher renin
profiles.25 Blocking the effect of renal sympathetic nerves
has been proved to be an effective way to affect RAS,
accordingly, blocking the renal sympathetic nerve pathway
should present the same effect. Kassab et al. described how
RDN prevented the transient increase of plasma renin activ-
ity in the obesity-induced hypertension dog model.26
Moreover, variables of the circulating RAS are undetecta-
ble after bilateral nephrectomy.27 A recent human postmor-
temhistologicstudydemonstratedthattherenalsympathetic
nerves are distributed around the renal artery and a great
proportion of renal sympathetic nerves had close proximity
to the lumen-intima interface which should thus be acces-
sible via renal artery interventional approaches such as
catheter ablation.28 Therefore, if endovascular RDN ablates
the renal sympathetic nerves in the adventitia successfully,
theoretically, the plasma levels of RAS will be decreased
after the procedure.As described in the results, RDN indeed
caused a uniform decrease in plasma renin and angiotensin
II. Furthermore, changes of plasma renin and BP in the pre-
sent study were similar to those in the study of Schlaich
et al.14 which showed that BP reduction was accompanied
by halving of renin activity after RDN in patients with
refractory hypertension.
Renin is recognized as an activator of RAS and angio-
tensin II is the most powerful biologically active product of
the RAS. Angiotensin II directly constricts vascular smooth
muscle cells, enhances myocardial contractility, stimulates
aldosterone production, stimulates release of catechola-
mines from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerve
endings, increases sympathetic nervous system activity,
and stimulates thirst and salt appetite.29 Also, many studies
mentioned in the introduction have indicated that angioten-
sin II is a potent stimulator of ET-1 production and exerts
its hypertensive effects via interaction with the ET system.
In our study, RDN caused a substantial and uniform
reduction in plasma levels of renin, angiotensin II, and
ET-1, accompanying a BP decrease. Additionally, there
were significant linear relationship between plasma level of
renin and angiotensin II, as well as plasma level of angio-
tensin II and ET-1. These findings suggested that RDN
attenuating the renal sympathetic activity could decrease
the plasma level of renin, which may affect the production
of angiotensin II and this later could then change the plasma
levels of ET-1. Decreased activity of the SNS is one of the
major underlying mechanisms of RDN on the marked and
sustained BP reduction, but the precise mechanisms that
cause the fall in BP in the short-term and, in particular,
long-term remain elusive. Therefore, our study offered a
new angle to explore the therapeutic mechanism of RDN.
Furthermore, excessive sympathetic drive and inappropri-
ate renin stimulation are hallmarks not only for refractory
hypertension, but also for chronic heart failure, progressive
kidney disease, sympathetically mediated insulin resist-
ance: all diseases where sympathetic nervous activity is
considered to play a key role in their development and pro-
gression. If the observations in this study continue to hold
true in future clinical studies, RDN might be extended in
the future to the treatment of various cardiovascular
diseases.
Renal angiogram
As we know, a saline-irrigated catheter which has been
used to ablate cardiac arrhythmia has the advantage of
being less likely to cause thrombus or char formation at the
ablation site. And recently RDN utilizing the saline-
irrigated radiofrequency ablation catheter has been demon-
strated to safely reduce BP in patients with refractory
hypertension by Ahmed et al.30 Compatible with this clini-
cal report, in the present study, RDN by saline-irrigated
radiofrequency ablation catheter decreased BP without
ablation-related complications occurring.Although angiog-
raphy results showed there were slight vessel irregularities
Figure 5.The results of angiography before, immediately, and one month after renal denervation (RDN), as shown in (a), (b), (c),
respectively.
538 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
caused by radiofrequency energy delivery, the lesions dis-
appeared at first month of follow-up. Our angiography
results were similar to those of the study by Steigerwald
et al.31 which conducted RDN using the Symplicity Catheter
System. In Simplicity trials, renal artery aneurysm or steno-
sis was seldom seen as judged by computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography.
Of note, the basis of catheter-based RDN is an intended tis-
sue injury to renal sympathetic nerve fibers caused by heat
generated by radiofrequency energy. Nevertheless, unin-
tended tissue injury to surrounding vascular structure caus-
ing edema, inflammation and fibrosis is conceivable, as are
focal artery irregularities shown in our repeat angiograms
immediately after radiofrequency energy delivery.Although
the incidence of ablation-related complications seems to be
low, unintended tissue injury to surrounding vascular struc-
tures may increase potential risks. Further, device technol-
ogy minimizing either mechanical or heat related vascular
tissue injury needs to be explored.
Study imitations
Some limitations should be considered in interpreting the
present results. Firstly, norepinephrine spillover measure-
ment may help estimating the activity of the efferent renal
sympathetic nerve, but our experimental facility did not
allow using radioisotopes. Secondly, due to sample size of
this study being relatively small, follow-up duration was
relatively short, and differences between the Kunming dogs
and hypertensive human subjects exist. Whether RDN could
still significantly decrease the plasma levels of RAS and
ET-1 in patients deserves further clinical studies, which will
be clarified in the on-going SouthWestern China renal
Artery sympathetic Nerve ablation study of Hypertension
(SWAN-HT) study (NCT01417221) with 70 resistant
hypertensive patients. Furthermore, a previous study32 indi-
cated that local RAS contents were inhomogeneous and tis-
sue RAS exerted particularly more important roles than
circulating RAS in cardiovascular pathophysiological con-
ditions. However, we investigated the effects of RDN on the
RAS via determining the changes in circulating levels of
renin, angiotensin II and ET-1, therefore, further studies
about effects of RDN on tissue RAS are necessary. Finally,
although angiograms showed focal artery irregularities
immediately after radiofrequency energy delivery all disap-
peared after one month, some local tissue damages were not
apparently identified by angiograph. Therefore, it would be
a bit premature to conclude that RDN using saline-irrigated
catheter would not cause any ablation-related complications
and further histological examinations are significant.
Conclusion
In conclusion, RDN caused a substantial reduction of BP,
and significantly decreased the plasma levels of the RAS
and ET-1, which may be implicated in the mechanisms of
marked and sustained BP reductions by RDN.
