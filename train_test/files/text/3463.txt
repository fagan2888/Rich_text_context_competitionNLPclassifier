ABSTRACT
The linear nonthreshold (LNT) model plays a central role in low-dose radiation
risk assessment for humans. With the LNT model, any radiation exposure is as-
sumed to increase one's risk of cancer. Based on the LNT model, others have
predicted tens of thousands of deaths related to environmental exposure to radio-
active material from nuclear accidents (e.g., Chernobyl) and fallout from nuclear
weapons testing. Here, we introduce a mechanism-based model for low-dose, radia-
tion-induced, stochastic effects (genomic instability, apoptosis, mutations, neoplas-
tic transformation) that leads to a LNT relationship between the risk for neoplastic
transformation and dose only in special cases. It is shown that nonlinear dose-
response relationships for risk of stochastic effects (problematic nonlethal muta-
tions, neoplastic transformation) should be expected based on known biological
mechanisms. Further, for low-dose, low-dose rate, low-LET radiation, large thresh-
olds may exist for cancer induction. We summarize previously published data
demonstrating large thresholds for cancer induction. We also provide evidence for
low-dose-radiation-induced, protection (assumed via apoptosis) from neoplastic
transformation. We speculate based on work of others (Chung 2002) that such
protection may also be induced to operate on existing cancer cells and may be
amplified by apoptosis-inducing agents such as dietary isothiocyanates.
Key Words: radiation, risk, low dose, model.

INTRODUCTION
The shape of the dose-response curve for stochastic effects (mutations, neoplastic
transformation, cancer) after exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation has for
years been the topic of enormous debate, yet this debate continues (Crawford-
Brown and Hofmann 1990, 1993; Chen and Wei 1991; Bond et al. 1995; Rossi and
Zaider 1997; Becker 1998, 2002; Bogen 1998; Calabrese and Baldwin 1998, 1999;
Calabrese et al. 1999; Kondo 1999; Pollycove and Feinendegen 1999; Brenner et at.
2001; Feinendegen and Pollycove 2001; NCRP 2001; Schollnberger et at. 2001a, b,
2002). The key discussion relates to whether the linear nonthreshold (LNT) model
for low-dose extrapolation of cancer risk is valid. This model is widely used by
regulatory agencies and in radiation and chemical protection. With the LNT hy-
pothesis, risk progressively increases as dose increases. Any amount of carcinogen
exposure increases one's risk of cancer. Thus, for radiation, any exposure is as-
sumed to increase one's risk of cancer. Tens of thousands of cancer deaths in the
U.S. have been calculated to arise from fallout from nuclear weapons testing (CDC/
NCI 2001). Similar numbers could possibly emerge if one chose to use the LNT
model to calculate cancer deaths from inhaling smoke from forest fires that have
occurred over the years (which contains naturally occurring and manmade radionu-
elides) .
Other possible dose-response curves (linear-threshold, sigmoid, u-shaped, etc.)
are considered to be more in line with known mechanisms of carcinogenesis
(Feinendegen et at. 1999,2000; Pollycove and Feinendegen 1999; Feinendegen and
Pollycove 2001; Schollnberger et al. 2002). The principal worker protection and
public health implication is that if a threshold response were assumed, then expo-
sures below the threshold value would be considered safe (Calabrese and Baldwin
1999).
It is highly unlikely that use of the LNT model will be abandoned by regulatory
agencies and in radiation/chemical protection unless substantial evidence ofthresh-
olds can be demonstrated from epidemiological studies and from mechanisms-
based experimental and theoretical investigations. Now there is growing evidence
from epidemiological, experimental, and mathematical modeling studies that does
not support use of the LNT model for central estimation ofcancer risks at low doses.
Instead, the results support the existence of thresholds (quite large in some cases)
for radiation-induced excess cancers, possibly in association with complex dose-
response relationships (e.g. u-shaped). The u-shaped dose-response relationship is
well known among researchers of hormesis (Calaberse and Baldwin 1998, 1999;
Calabrese et at. 1999; Ducoff 2002).
The foe us of this paper is to use a mechanisms-based model (called NEOTRANS2)
for radiation-induced neoplastic transformation (considered an early stage in can-
cer development), to show how thresholds for specific radiation-induced excess
stochastic effects (problematic nonlethal mutations and neoplastic transformation)
could arise in some cases as a result of natural protection (resilience) from radia-

tion-induced damage. Results for radiation may also apply to genotoxic chemicals.
The NEOTRANS2
model was mainly developed over the last 4 years largely in the
absence of supporting data initially for key modeling assumptions. However, over
these years, supporting data have slowly emerged via publications and presentations
by others in a variety of fields. Here, we introduce and explain the supporting data
and present the NEOTRANS
2
model as though it were developed based on existing
data to support key modeling assumptions. This form of presentation was selected
to help the reader feel more familiar with these assumptions (as some relate to novel
mechanisms) when presented.
MOLECULAR MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH CARCINOGENESIS
Macromolecular Changes
Ionizing radiation induces a range of DNA damage similar to that which arises
endogenously from reactive oxygen species generated as byproducts of metabolism
Oeggo 2002). Daniel Billen (1990), in discussing the concept of negligible dose in
the context of naturally occurring DNA damage and repair, has reported that
thousands of spontaneous DNA-damaging events occur in each cell each day.
Robert Stewart (1999) reported an estimate (best estimate) numerically equivalent
to 105 spontaneous "Locally Multiple Damage Sites" (in particular double strand
breaks) occurring in DNA, per million cells, per day. These lesions are quickly
repaired, essentially error free in most cases. It is highly plausible that adding a few
tens or hundreds more of such lesions through low-dose radiation (especially low-
LET radiation) or low-dose chemical exposure is unlikely to overwhelm the cell's
highly efficient damage repair machinery. Therefore, it is reasonable that error-free
repair could operate after very low doses of low-LET radiation or genotoxic chemi-
cal.
Numerous repair processes are now known and include nucleotide excision
repair, base excision repair, transcription-eoupled repair, mismatch repair, and
nonhomologous end joining (Friedberg et al. 1995; Scicchitano and Mellon 1997;
Hanawalt 2001). The indicated repair processes operate at the individual cell level
and provide for individual cell resilience to vulnerable states. A complex cell
signaling network regulates the individual-resilience system. The failure of this
system can lead to repair errors, which in turn can lead to problematic lethal and
nonlethal mutations (forms of genomic instability).
Operationally, two types of mutations (heightened vulnerability states) are used
to classifygenes: (I) those where a mutation causes a gain in function (protooncogene
to oncogene change); and (2) those where mutations cause function loss (tumor
suppressor genes). In the development of leukemia and lymphoma, the first step is
considered to be activation of a protooncogene into an oncogene, which arises via
a translocation of a promoter beside the active site of a normally repressed growth-
promoting gene site (Young 1994).
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003 95
Scott et al.
In the case of thyroid cancer, specific genes are rearranged that involve activation
of the ret protooncogene (Jacob et at. 1996; Rabes and Klugbauer 1998; Smida et at.
1999). Whereas oncogene activations are quite specific, for tumor suppressor gene
mutations, random deletions of large amounts of DNA, large parts of a gene, an
entire gene, or several genes could occur. For many solid tumors, the inactivation
ofa tumor suppressor gene is considered to be the first step in the cancer induction
process and is commonly assumed to affect a tissue-specific "gatekeeper" (Sidransky
1996; Trott and Roseman 2000). After loss of the gatekeeper function, clonal
expansion of tissue-specific stem cells is allowed (Sidransky 1996).
Radiation mutagenesis may principally proceed via DNA deletions through
misrepair and misrecombination at DNA double-strand breaks (ICRP 1999; Trott
and Roseman 2000). In our modeling of radiation-induced neoplastic transforma-
tion, mutations are assumed to arise from misrepair of DNA damage, and nonlethal
mutations are assumed responsible for the initial persistent genomic instability.
Here, we have not distinguished between misrecombination of DNA double strand
breaks, misrepair, or incomplete repair. Presently, we only distinguish between
lethal and nonlethal mutations.
Genomic Instability and Mutations
The concept of genomic instability was introduced by W. F. Morgan and col-
leagues (1996) and is now widely accepted. Genomic instability can propagate over
successive cell generations (Morgan et at. 1996; Wright 1998). We consider all
mutations to represent genomic instability. Problematic nonlethal mutations among
dividing cells we consider to possess persistent problematic instability (PPI) transfer-
able to progeny. Most radiation-induced mutations directly involve the loss of large
parts of the tested gene, leading to loss ofheterozygosity (Trott and Roseman 2000).
However, most radiation-induced mutations associated with genomic instability are
point mutations and small deletions (Little 1999). In modeling radiation-induced
genomic instability, we do not assume PPI to be associated with a specific type of
mutation. We only distinguish between lethal and nonlethal mutations, and we
assume that neoplastic transformation arises as a stochastic process among cells
(including progeny) with PPI.
Some useful findings related to genomic instability have been reported in a study
of 20 liver tumors, which were diagnosed in a cohort of people treated with
Thorotrast (Iwamoto et at. 1999). It was found that 95% of the cases showed p53
point mutations. Iwamoto et at. (1999) concluded that the relevant genetic alter-
ations leading to liver cancer result from an induced genetic instability (indirect
effect), rather than from radiation exposure directly. In our modeling of neoplastic
transformation, we have characterized PPI as an indirect effect (arising via misrepair)
of irradiation (or chemical exposure) that can be passed to cell progeny. We have
also introduced a new class of genomic instability (transient; Scott 1997), which is
now modeled as a direct effect (hit hypersensitive cells) and indirect effect (includ-
ing deleterious bystander effects) of irradiation.

Mechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response
Apoptosis: Protector of the Cell Community from Stochastic Effects
In contrast to the necrotic mode of cell death, apoptosis protects from problem-
atic cells in the body via their elimination without causing inflammation (Mendonca
et at. 1999). Strasser et at. (2000) summarized key points associated with apoptosis
signaling as follows:
Apoptosis, a physiological process for killing cells, is critical for the normal
development and function of multicellular organisms. Abnormalities in cell
death control can contribute to a variety of diseases, including cancer, autoim-
munity, and degenerative disorders. Signaling for apoptosis occurs through
multiple independent pathways that are initiated either from triggering events
within the cell or from outside the cell, for instance, by ligation of death
receptors.
New research results indicated that problematic cells in the body may be detected
via molecular biological mechanisms and selectively eliminated via apoptosis to
protect the cell community (Yang et at. 2000). A key assumption of the NEOTRANS
2
model to be introduced is that existing problematic cells (e.g., problematic mutants,
neoplastically transformed cells) in the cell community can be signaled to undergo
apoptosis and selectively eliminated via low-dose-induced protective bystander mecha-
nisms. These mechanisms of reduction in cell community vulnerability status we
presume to explain, at least in part, reported low-dose hypersensitivity to cell killing
among cancer cell lines (joiner et at. 1999) as well as virally transfected cells
(Seymour and Mothersill 2000).
Thus, the NEOTRANS
2
model to be presented includes both deleterious and
protective bystander effects.
Possible Mechanisms for Recognizing and Selectively Eliminating Problematic
Cells
As already indicated, we have hypothesized the existence ofa protective apoptotic
bystander effect for neoplastic transformation. Such an effect is necessary to ad-
equately explain existing data whereby risks for neoplastic transformation (Azzam
et at. 1996; Redpath et at. 2001) and lung cancer (Rossi and Zaider 1997) decrease
rather than increase at very low doses.
A crucial missing link related to our modeling is identification of mechanisms
whereby problematic cells already present in a population can be recognized and
signaled to undergo apoptosis, while nearby normal cells are essentially unaffected.
Some progress is being made by researchers to identify and characterize such a
protective process for the cell community.
Cucinotta et at. (2002) point out that ionizing radiation produces DNA damage
that causes protein fluctuations through binding damage recognition proteins to
DNA breaks and subsequent downstream events. The type of fluctuations may
depend on the type of DNA break such as simple or complex single-strand breaks
and double-strand breaks or base damage (Cunniffe and O'Neil 1999).
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No. I, 2003 97
Scott et at.
Barcellos-Hoffand Brooks (2001) point out that bystander effects after low doses
of radiation are extracellular signaling pathways that modulate both cellular repair
and death programs. The authors also indicate that transforming growth factor J3
(TGFB1) is known to be an extracellular sensor of damage. They further indicate
that extracellular signaling relevant to carcinogenesis in normal tissue can eliminate
abnormal cells or suppress neoplastic behavior.
Dr. C.-R. Yang and colleagues (2000) at Case Western University have reported
clusterin [CLU, a.k.a. TRPM-2, SGP-2, or radiation-induced protein-8 (XIP8)] to be
implicated in apoptosis. In a recent study (Yang et at. 2000), they reisolated CLUj
XIP8 by yeast two-hybrid analyses, using as bait the DNA double-strand break repair
protein Ku70. They showed that low-dose, radiation-induced nuclear CLU /XIP8
protein coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized in vivo with Ku70/Ku80, a known
DNA damage sensor and key double-strand break repair protein, in human MCF-
7:WS8 breast cancer cells. Their key finding was that enhanced expression and
accumulation of nuclear CLU/XIP8-Ku70/Ku80 complexes appear to be an impor-
tant cell death signal after irradiation. Further, their data suggest that CLU/XIP8
may play an important role in monitoring cells with genomic instability and/or
infidelity, created by translesion DNA synthesis, by facilitating removal ofgenetically
unstable cells as well as severely damaged cells. Yang et at. (2000) strongly suggest
that the CLU/XIP8 protein is a general cell death signal, monitoring overall cell
health.
Yang et at. point out that the recent findings that Ku70, but not Ku80, knockout
mice are cancer prone appear consistent with the notion that formation of nuclear
CLU/XIP8 with Ku70 may play an important role in eliminating carcinogenic
initiated (problematic) cells.
It is now known from in vitrostudies of viral-induced neoplastic transformation
(Bauer 1996) that:
· Increasing plating density reduces transformation frequency.
· Transformed cells are selectively killed via apoptosis.
· Cytokines and reactive oxygen produced by nontransformed neighboring cells
trigger apoptosis.
· TGFB1 enables nontransformed cells to trigger apoptosis among transformed
cells.
Given the above information, we consider our key modeling assumption of the
existence of an inducible protective bystander apoptosis effect whereby problematic
cells are recognized (after signaling from other cells) and selectively eliminated
from the cell community to be highly plausible.
Another assumption we make is that neoplastic transformation is a necessary
early step for cancer induction (a widely held view). Thus, demonstrating low-dose-
98 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003
Mechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response
induced protection from neoplastic transformation in vitro is consistent with the
possibility of low-dose-induced protection from cancer in vivo.
Cellular Differentiation
The current view is that some problematic cells may undergo differentiation
(group resilience), and this also protects the cell community from propagating
stochastic adverse effects. Presently, the NEOTRANS2
model does not include this
feature. We consider differentiation to be more important in vivo than in vitro. Our
modeling applications presented in this paper relate to in vitro studies.
Deleterious Bystander Effects
Deleterious bystander effects (Ballarini etal. 2002) whereby unirradiated cells are
damaged have been examined in two general types of cellular systems. In the first,
monolayer cultures have been exposed to very low fluences of alpha particles either
from an external source (Nagasawa and Little 1992; Azzam et al. 1998; Little et al.
2002) or focused microbeam (Hei et al. 1997; Prise et al. 1998). The second tech-
nique involves harvesting medium from irradiated cells and incubating it with
nonirradiated cells (Mothersill and Seymour 1997; Lyng et al. 2000). Both tech-
niques have demonstrated that cells not being irradiated can still be damaged.
Further, the bystander effect does not arise from simply irradiating media. Cell
damage and intercellular signaling are essential.
We also allow for the possibility of deleterious bystander effects via model param-
eters that account for both direct and indirect deleterious radiation effects.
THE NEOTRANS2
MODEL AND ITS PREDECESSOR NEOTRANS1
Our modeling research focuses on characterizing excess stochastic effects (mu-
tations, neoplastic transformations) after very low doses ofradiation by using mecha-
nisms-based models. While many in vitroexperimental studies have been conducted
on radiation-induced neoplastic transformation, only limited experimental data are
available for doses < 100 mGy (Azzam et al. 1994, 1996; Redpath and Antoniono
1998; Redpath et al. 2001).
In previous work, we introduced a class of models (that included NEOTRANSj )
for characterizing neoplastic transformation of cells that relates the probability of
neoplastic transformation to the state ofgenomic instability (Scott 1997; Schollnberger
et al. 2001 a; Scott et al. 2001). With NEOTRANS1, the target cell population was
modeled as heterogeneous with both hypersensitive- and resistant-cell subpopula-
tions (considered the simplest case of heterogeneity). NEOTRANS1
has now been
refined, leading to a model called NEOTRANS2
(Figures 1 and 2) that includes
apoptotic and necrotic death pathways. In this paper, NEOTRANS2
is applied to in
vitro data for low-radiation-dose-induced neoplastic transformation. We have fo-
cused only on data with several dose groups :s; 100 mGy.

Genomic Instability States Used in NEOTRANS2
Our use of terminology related to genomic instability is the same as used in
earlier publications (Scott 1997; Schollnberger et al. 2001a). The expression "ge-
nomic instability state" refers to any spontaneous or toxicant-induced instability in
the genome, including any initial transient instability, as well as any persistent
instability that can be passed to cell progeny. In addition to a stable (ST) genome,
the NEOTRANS2
model (as well as NEOTRANS1) involves four types of genomic
instability (Figures 1 and 2): (1) Normal-minor instability (NMI), associated with
normal cell function and normal genome status; (2) Transient-minor instability (TMI) ,
associated with toxicant-induced genomic damage that is fully repairable (without
any significant errors); (3) Transient-problematic instability (TPI), associated with
genomic damage that may sometimes be fully repaired but can be misrepaired; and
(4) PPI, which arises from misrepair that yields nonlethal mutations. Thus, PPI can
be passed to progeny, increasing their potential for stochastic effects such as neo-
plastic transformation. We use the term misrepair in a broad sense as already
indicated. We consider TPI and PPI to be vulnerability states (for additional delete-
rious stochastic effects).
Other Model Features
With the NEOTRANS2
model, a very small fraction, To« 1, of the cell population
is presumed to have already undergone neoplastic transformation over their life
history. The discussion that immediately follows relates to the remaining vast major-
ity (1 - To "" 1) of the cells. With both NEOTRANS2
(Figures I and 2) and
NEOTRANS
j ,
only cells in the high vulnerability state PPI (viable mutants) can
produce neoplastically transformed progeny. Only genomically ST cells, those with
NMI, and those with PPI progress through the cell cycle and divide. Other cells are
assumed arrested at cell cycle checkpoints (resilience facilitation) where genomic
damage is repaired or misrepaired. Irradiation times were assumed quite short
relative to cell cycle transit times, so that no equations were used to account for
progression through the cell cycle during irradiation. Neoplastic transformations
are assumed to occur as a stochastic process, and the transformed cells may have an
altered cell cycle transit time distribution.
With NEOTRANS2, target genes are specified (Figures 1 and 2) and include
tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, repair genes, apoptosis genes, and cell-eycle
regulator genes. Unlike NEOTRANS1, with NEOTRANS2
cell killing is explicitly
addressed and not treated as independent ofneoplastic transformation. Two modes
of cell death are considered: apoptosis (assumed to predominate at very low doses)
and necrotic death (assumed important only at moderate and high doses). Again,
nonlethal mutations are assumed to arise via misrepair. Lethal mutations are as-
signed to the apoptosis pathway (including delayed lethal mutations). The analytical
solutions in the present paper apply only to very low-radiation doses where necrotic
death can be assumed negligible.
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003 101
Scott et al.
Model parameters aI' a 2, and a 3, common to both NEOTRANSj
and NEOTRANS2,
reflect genomic sensitivity to initial and higher levels of damage production and
should be multiplied by the dose rate c. The parameters III and 112 are also common
to both models and govern the commitment rate of damaged cells to an error-free
repair pathway. In addition, the parameters 111 and 112 are common to both models
and govern the commitment rate ofdamaged cells to a misrepair pathway that leads
to nonlethal mutant cells (PPI cells).
In light of new evidence that protracted exposure to low-LET radiation can lead
to large dose thresholds for cancer induction, we allow 111 and 112 to be step functions
of dose rate. Below a critical dose-rate value c* (presently undetermined), the
parameters take on a value of zero. This dose-rate threshold is presumed to depend
on the type of radiation and type of cancer. For dose rates above c*, the parameters
then take on fixed values> zero. The parameters <1>1 and <1>2 appear only in NEOTRANS2
and govern the rate of commitment of damaged cells (including lethal mutations)
to the apoptotic pathway. The parameters KI and K2
(which are important only for
moderate and high doses) appear only in NEOTRANS2
and when multiplied by
dose rate, govern the rate at which already damaged cells enter the necrotic death
pathway. Typical units for ex, and 1\ are mGy-I. Typical units for u, 11i' and <1>i are min-I.
Parameters aI' a 2, and a 3
should be viewed as being comprised of two parts: (1)
one part relates to direct damage to DNA; (2) the other part relates to indirect
damage to DNA and includes deleterious bystander effects.
For very low-radiation doses, only hypersensitive cells are assumed to be induced
to transform (new transformations) and cells are modeled as being killed only via
the apoptotic pathway. Thus, only Figure 1 applies for very low doses and to the
hypersensitive subfraction, fl , of cells at risk.
Further, with our current version of the NEOTRANS
2
model, a fraction To
(stochastic quantity) of cells at risk is assumed to have already undergone sponta-
neous neoplastic transformation, based on genomic alterations over their life his-
tory, but prior to dosing with radiation (or chemical). Because the life history ofcells
spans a long time compared to the short time period over which cells are irradiated
during in vitro studies, this is considered a highly plausible assumption when apply-
ing NEOTRANS2
to data from in vitro irradiation studies. For in oioo exposure,
additional protective mechanisms could be important (Stecca and Gerber 1998;
Barcellos-Hoff and Brooks 2001).
Model Solutions for Very Low Doses
Evidence is now strong that death via apoptosis at low radiation doses can occur
via a bystander mechanism (Mothersill and Seymour 1998a, b; Lyng et al. 2000;
Belyakov et al. 2001a, b, 2002a, b; Prise et al. 2002). We consider the highly plausible
possibility that a fraction foof the To cells already neoplastically transformed is killed
via a bystander effect for apoptosis (a key modeling assumption). In such cases, the
dose response at very low-radiation doses could decrease rather than increase.
Indeed, this type of dose response has now been demonstrated experimentally with
102 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003
Mechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response
60Co-gamma irradiation of C3H lOTI/2 cells (Azzam et al. 1996) and with 137Cs-
gamma irradiation of HeLa x skin fibroblast human hybrid cells (Redpath and
Antoniono 1998; Redpath et at. 2001).
The analytical solutions that follow apply to very small dose increments. As
indicated, a small fraction To of cells in the population is modeled as already having
the problem of interest (e.g., neoplastic transformation in this case, but a similar
equation would apply to nonlethal problematic mutations). At such doses, newly
induced neoplastic transformations are modeled as arising from a small (in num-
ber), hypersensitive subfraction of remaining (I - To) cells at risk. This hypersensi-
tive subfraction is given by fl(1 - To) "" fl' From Figure I (which shows only
hypersensitive cells), it can be seen that a very small dose increment ~D (where ~D
== c M, for a small time increment M) to the fraction fl(I - To) of hypersensitive cells
will lead to an expected fraction fl(1 - To)ul~D of cells in the state TPI (assuming
all hypersensitive cells are initially in the state NMI); for this fraction entering the
transient state TPI, the conditional probability ofsubsequently undergoing misrepair
(leading to PPI) is just fIJ/ (I-ll + TIl + cl>1)'
The dose-response function for radiation-induced, neoplastic transformations
per surviving cell, TFSC(~D), at very low doses ~D is thus given by the following:
TFSC(~D) = To, for ~D = 0,
TFSC(~D) = (l - fo)To + [(1 - To)fluITlIQ/(1-l1 + TIl + lJ>1)] ~D, for ~D > O. (1)
For ~D > 0, Equation I has a fixed slope of (1 - To)flul11IQ/(1-l1 + 111 + lJ>1)' The
parameter Q is the proportion of the newly induced parental PPI cells that produce
nc-oplastically transformed progeny. The parameter Q, therefore, depends on fol-
low-lip time. It is also likely influenced by the signaling characteristic ofthe cellular
roumumity (Barcellos-Hoff and Brooks 2001). Equation I leads to the LNT model
only when fo = 0 (i.e., when the protective apoptosis effect is absent) and TIl > 0
(misrepair occurs).
Equation I is based on the assumption that intercellular signaling that leads to
the protective bystander apoptosis effect occurs without a radiation dose threshold.
Data to be presented later (Azzam et al. 1996; Redpath et al. 2001) support this
hypothesis for ionizing radiation. However, this may not be the case for genotoxic
chemicals (Walker et al. 2002).
With Equation 1, the dose-response relationship is discontinuous at zero dose
[steps down from To to (1- fo)To]. The dose-response associated with Equation I is
linear but with a zero-dose intercept of (1 - fo)Torather than To when fitted to low-
dose data with the zero-dose group excluded (see hypothetical dose-response curve
in Figure 3). As indicated in Figure 3, To is stochastic.
The dose-response curve forTFSC will exceed To (a random variable) only for ~D
in excess of a stochastic threshold (StoThresh) dose DTh

Here, we assumed that cell survival is very near 100% at the very low doses consid-

Azzam et al. (1996). A StoThresh (as apposed to a deterministic threshold) is consid-
ered to occur because To as well as all other model parameters are treated as
stochastic.
Since To is on the order of 10-4 to 10-5 for most in vitro studies of neoplastic
transformation, selectively killing all To cells (i.e., fo = 1) would still lead to a cell
survival fraction> 0.999. Unfortunately, currently available data at low doses for
which equations apply are inadequate to derive distributions for individual model
parameters 111' TIl' <1>1' fl, aI' fo' and O. However, more general forms of Equations 1

Equation 1 can be rewritten in the more general form:

Equation 3 can be considered a generalized, three-parameter (stochastic param-
eters fo, To, and kT) form of the NEOTRANS2
model for application to very low-
radiation doses. A corresponding equation may also apply to highly genotoxic
chemicals, with ~D then representing a very small dose of the agent of interest. For
a constant exposure time (for a chemical), ~D could be replaced by the concentra-
tion with the parameter kTredefined to include the exposure time in the numera-
tor.
Equation 2 can also be rewritten in the more general form:

Figure 3 shows a hypothetical mean dose-response curve based on Equations 3 and
4. In the figure, hypothetical distributions F(To) (shown vertically) and G(Dn,)
(shown horizontally) are presented for To and DTh, respectively.
For very low doses and in the framework of the NEOTRANS2
model, it is possible
that the protective bystander effect may predominate (fo» kT~D) when the spon-
taneous frequency To of transformation is relatively high and when fo> 0 and ~D is
very small (e.g., less than about 100 mGy low-LET radiation). Implied here is a
relative small value for the slope parameter kTin combination with a small dose. In
such cases, the data for radiation-associated neoplastic transformation (and for
specific problematic nonlethal mutations) should be adequately represented by the
relationships:
TFSC(~D) = To, for ~D = 0
= (1 - fo)To, for ~D > O. (5)
Further, TFSC (~D) should be uncorrelated with dose over the dose range for which
the above applies. This requirement only applies to doses in excess of background.
We later apply Equation 5 to two data sets for gamma-ray-induced neoplastic cell
transformation for doses up to about 100 mGy.
We describe later how distributions for To (stochastic), DTh (stochastic), and the
slope parameter kT have been obtained for induced neoplastictransformation.
FITTING THE NEOTRANS2
MODEL TO DATA
Data Used to Estimate Model Parameters
We fitted the protective bystander effects version of the model to available data
for radiation-induced neoplastic transformation (two data sets) and low-dose apoptosis
(one data set):
Data Set 1 - Gamma-ray-induced neoplastic transformation data of Redpath et
at. (2001) (delayed plating):
· HeLa x skin fibroblast human hybrid cells
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003 105
Scott et al.
· 137CS gamma rays
· Dose rate: 3.3 mGy/min for dose < 100 mGy; 41.3 mGy/min otherwise
· Doses: 0, 1,5, 10,50, 100, 300, and 500 mGy
Data Set 2 - Gamma-ray-induced neoplastic transformation data of Azzam et at.
(1996) (delayed plating):
· C3H 10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblast clone 8 cells
· BOCO gamma rays
· Dose rate: 2.4 mGy/min
· Doses: 0, 1, 10, and 100 mGy
Data Set 3 - Gamma-ray-induced cell killing (via apoptosis) data ofSeymour and
Mothersill (2000):
· Human keratinocytes (immortalized via viral transfection but not transformed)
· BOCO gamma rays
· Dose rate: 750 mGy/min
· Doses: 0, 10, 30,50, and 100 mGy
Estimating Model Parameters
For the narrow dose range (0 to 100 mGy), all data (for ~D > 0) for transforma-
tion and cell survival were uncorrelated with dose. This is in line with characteristics
of the NEOTRANS2
model that predicts that the largest effect at very low doses is
the protective bystander apoptosis effect, which is modeled as being independent of
dose.
For data in the dose interval 0 to 100 mGy (excluding the zero dose group), the
parameter £;) was evaluated for both the data of Redpath et at. (2001) and Azzam et
at. (1996) as follows based on Equation 5. For 0 < ~D::;; 100 mGy, fofor transforma-
tion was calculated as a function of the mean observed transformation frequency,
TFSC, and reported mean for To using the relationship
fO= 1 - (TFSC/To)' (6)
Equation 6 was used for each dose in the dose range indicated leading to different
estimates of fo. and corresponding values (l-fo)To. Mean values for (1-fo)Toand the
associated standard deviation were obtained. Dose-response relationships (horizon-
tal line) were based on these means and the associated 95% confidence intervals
assuming a normal distribution.
106 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003
Mechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response
Bayesian methods (Siva 1998) were used only for the neoplastic transformation
data of Redpath et at. (2001) and only when doses over the wider range of 0 to 500
mGy were evaluated. For this dose range, Equations 5 and 6 do not apply. Equation
3 applies and was therefore used. WinBUGS software (Spiegelhalter et at. 1999) was
used to carry out the Bayesian inference via use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analyses. Transformants were modeled as having Poisson distributions.
For the Bayesian analysis, the prior distribution for kT
was uniform over the interval
(4 x 1O-L 7.5 x 10-8) ; for fo' a uniform prior distribution over the interval 0 to 1 was
used; for To, a normal prior distribution was used with a mean of 2.24 x 10-5 and
standard deviation of2.8 x 10~ [same values as reported by Redpath et at. (2001)).
Five thousand MCMC iterations were first run. Auto correlations were then exam-
ined to judge how many additional iterations were needed for convergence. Fewer
than 30,000 iterations (total) were found needed to ensure convergence. Iterations
were then increased so that the total was 60,000. These iterations were more than
were needed, but they essentially guaranteed convergence of the Markov chains.
The first 40,000 iterations were then discarded as bum-in. Analysis of posterior
distributions was then based on the final 20,000 MCMC realizations.
MODEliNG RESULTS
Figure 4 shows results obtained for our analysis of the Azzam et at. '5 (1996) data
for gamma-ray-induced neoplastic transformation ofC3H 10T1/2 cells in vitro. Only
data in the very low dose range (0 to 100 mGy), where Equation 5 applies, were used.
For this dose range (with the zero dose group excluded), there was no significant
correlation between transformation frequency and dose (R2 = 0.18, P > 0.5).
The corresponding results for application of the NEOTRANS2 model to the
Redpath et at. (2001) data for gamma-ray-induced neoplastic transformation of
HeLa x skin fibroblast cells are presented in Figure 5. Solid points in these figures
represent the experimental data, and smooth and dashed curves represent model-
associated results with means (central curve) and 95% confidence regions. For these
data and for doses above zero, there was no significant correlation of transformation
frequency with dose (R2 = 0.4, P = 0.2).
In both Figures 4 and 5 the risk of neoplastic transformation clearly drops
immediately below the spontaneous frequency to a fixed value independent of
radiation dose, as predicted by the NEOTRANS2 model (Equation 5).
The mean and standard deviations for fowere 0.32 ± 0.04 and 0.71 ± 0.04 for the
data of Redpath et at. (2001) and Azzam et at. (1996), respectively. The parameter
fomean was therefore 2.2 times larger for the C3H lOT1/2 cells than for the HeLa
x skin fibroblast human hybrid cells. Similarly, the spontaneous frequency mean was
about 76 times larger for the C3H 10T1/2 cells than for the HeLa xskin fibroblast
cells. These results suggest that fo may be correlated with genetic sensitivity, being
larger (more protective) for the more sensitive target cells. However, what implica-
tion this has for sensitive individuals is unclear.

Figure 6 shows results of applying the NEOTRANS2
model to a wider range of
doses (0 to 500 mGy) based on the Redpath et at. (2001) data for gamma-ray-
induced neoplastic transformation of HeLa X skin fibroblast human hybrid cells.
Equation 3 was used in this analysis in conjunction with Bayesian methods.
Transformants were modeled as having dose-dependent Poisson distributions with
the expected frequency given by Equation 3. Solid points in Figure 6 represent
experimental data. Upper and lower lines drawn represent the upper and lower
95% credibility bands (from Bayesian posterior distribution), and the central line
represents the posterior mean. Model parameter estimates are presented in Table
I along with standard deviations, and 5% (percentile), 50%, and 95% values.
The central line in Figure 6 has been used to demonstrate a protective effect of
low-dose radiation against neoplastic transformation. Figure 7 shows the benefit
(expected number of spontaneous transformants eliminated) to harm (expected
number of newly induced transformants) ratio. A benefit/harm ratio » I demon-
strates potential for possibly eliminating early stage cancer cells from the body via
low-dose irradiation (e.g., from radon in the home, living at a high altitude where
cosmic ray doses are higher, etc.). Similar potential protection likely also exists for
other inducers of apoptosis signaling (e.g., apoptosis-inducing chemicals in food
such as isothiocyanates [Yang et al. 2002]). Note that the benefit/harm ratio in-
creases steeply as the dose decreases below about 50 mGy. The lowest dose featured
on the curve is 10 mGy. For this dose, the benefit/harm ratio exceeds 600,000. This
means that on average, for each newly induced transformant, more than 600,000
assumed already present spontaneous transformants are eliminated via the pre-
sumed protective bystander apoptosis effect. This is a pronounced protective effect
since relatively little harm to a human would be expected to be associated with a 10
mGy radiation dose, especially if protracted. Further, the benefit/harm ratio may
increase as the period over which the dose is delivered increases because extending

exposure also would be expected to prolong the period over which the protective
bystander effect was operating.
Similar protection has also been demonstrated in cancer chemoprevention
studies where apoptosis-inducing isothiocyanates in the diet have prevented
the occurrence of benzo (a) pyrene-induced lung tumors in mice (Yang et al.
2002) .
Radiation may also induce the elimination of virally transfected cells via the
protective bystander apoptosis effect. Figure 8 shows results obtained in model-
ing the cell survival data of Seymour and Mothersill (2000) for gamma ray-
induced apoptosis in human papillomavirus type 16 transfected (Pirisi et al.
1988) human keratinocytes. The cell killing for the dose range 0 to 100 mGy was
modeled as arising from a protective bystander effect that was independent of
dose for ~D > O. As seen in Figure 8, the data are in excellent agreement with
the modeling assumptions. For the indicated data and for doses> 0, there was
no correlation between survival and dose (R2 = 0.04, P > 0.5). The parameter fo
(for removal of problematic cells) was found to have a mean and standard
deviation of 0.37 ± 0.08 (i.e., 37% of problematic virally transfected cells are
expected to be removed via a protective bystander apoptosis effect).

DISCUSSION
With the NEOTRANS
2
model, neoplastic transformation arises as a stochastic
process but only for cells in the high vulnerability state PPJ. The PPJ (spontaneous
or induced) is assumed to arise via nonlethal mutational events. These mutations
are the type described by Mothersill and Seymour (l998b) as nonlethal but possibly
cancer-facilitating mutations.
Results in Figures 4 and 5 are consistent with predictions of the NEOTRANS2
model that for very low doses of low-LET radiation, TFSC (L1D) should be below the
spontaneous frequency and independent of dose (e.g., in the range 0 to 100 mGy).
Results in Figure 6 for gamma ray-induced neoplastic transformation of HeLa x skin
fibroblast human hybrid cells have 5% (percentile), 50%, and 95% values for the
Bayesian posterior distribution for the StoThresh of approximately 50, 150, and 250
mGy, respectively. We can state that the data used are consistent with a StoThresh and
that the Bayesian posterior distribution for the threshold assigns essentially a zero
probability for the threshold being zero. A value of zero corresponds to the LNT
model. The dose-response curve for excess transformations is clearly of the nonlin-
ear, threshold type.

Figure 8. Observed and simulated survival of gamma-irradiated human papillomavirus
transfected keratinoeytes based on the Seymour and Mothersill (2000) data
(solid points). Analyses were performed for the dose range ato 100 mGy. Model-
associated means (central curve), 5% (percentile; lower curve), and 95% (upper
curve) values are presented based on an assumed norrnal distribution.
A similar analysis was attempted for fission neutron (Hill et at. 1984; Balcer-
Kubiczek and Harrison 1991) and for alpha particle data of others (Bettega et at.
1992) for induced neoplastic transformation. However, a close examination of
posterior distributions for the StoThresh revealed modes (highest values in the
distribution function) very close to zero with the distributions having a tail to the
right but not to the left of the modes. Such results indicate that a zero-dose
threshold for the high-LET radiation-induced neoplastic transformation could not
be excluded based on the very limited data used. Central (mean) estimates of the
thresholds were < 10 mGy, which would be very difficult to demonstrate experimen-
tally.
We now introduce the term group (G) adaptation to describe any cell community
adaptation initiated by a group of cells that protects the cell community (including
the elimination of problematic cells as well as reducing cell vulnerability by cell
differentiation). G-adaptation therefore also applies to low-dose radiation therapy
for cancer (used in Europe but currently forbidden in the U.S.) assuming problem-
atic cancer cells to be signaled via irradiated normal cells to undergo apoptosis.
Where an individual cell adapts to an environmental stress by changing its
resilience or vulnerability status, we called this individual (1) adaptation. Thus,
112 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003
Mechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response
'?I-adaptation can be beneficial or problematic, depending on the endpoint consid-
ered. An example ofbeneficial I-adaptation would be the induction of an error-free
repair process, thereby increasing the cells' resilience to the induction of stochastic
effects. An example of problematic I-adaptation would be a stress-related induction
of an error-prone repair process producing viable mutations that facilitate the
occurrence of neoplastic transformations.
Another example of problematic I-adaptation is when an individual cell through
adapting to a different environment has a net reduction in its capacity to undergo
apoptosis. A reduced capacity to undergo apoptosis increases the risk for stochastic
effects such as neoplastic transformation and cancer. Studies at our Institute suggest
that background radiation can influence cells through problematic I-adaptation.
Dr. Saxena and colleagues (2002) have conducted studies whereby cells irradiated
after maintenance at background radiation levels were compared to corresponding
cells irradiated after being maintained at lower than background (via special shield-
ing). The cells maintained at lower than normal background had reduced compe-
tence for undergoing apoptosis. These finding are in line with the view that back-
ground radiation may serve as a natural nutrient. Moving from a region of moderate
background radiation to a region oflower background may over time increase one's
susceptibility to the induction of stochastic effects.
Note that the view that problematic I-adaptation can lead to an increase in cancer
risk is consistent with reported cancer risks from radon in homes (Cohen 1995). Dr.
Cohen (1995) reported lung cancer mortality related to residential radon exposure
in the U.S. After adjusting for smoking, lung cancer mortality was found to decrease
with increasing mean residential radon levels.
Some early modeling publications attempted to explain high-LET radiation
inverse dose rate effect in vivo based on cell culture studies where cells were
irradiated over several hours (Brenner and Hall 1990; Elkind 1994). These models
were essentially based on the hypothesis that cells would be repeatedly hit at
sensitive stages of the cell cycle during protracted irradiation. Such a hypothesis is
inconsistent with the observation that damaged cells are arrested at cell-cycle check-
points rather than progress through the cell cycle. Further, biological kinetics over
a few hours cannot explain inverse dose rate effects from radiation doses delivered
over months to years. We speculate that inverse dose rate effects, such as those seen
by Dr. Cohen (1995) that involve dose delivery over months to years, are more likely
related to problematic I-adaptation, where cells in lower radiation environments
(relative to an optimum) lose ability to undergo apoptosis. Additional problematic
I-adaptation may be associated with the known decrease in DNA repair efficiency
with increasing age.
With the current version of NEOTRANS
2, a fraction fo of the spontaneous
neoplastic transformants is eliminated via a radiation- (or chemical-) induced pro-
tective bystander apoptosis effect. The parameter fo can be viewed as representing
the number of present spontaneous neoplastic transformants (of the type of inter-
est) eliminated via the protective bystander apoptosis effect divided by the total
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003 113
Scott et al.
number of spontaneous neoplastic transformants present. We give the parameter fo
the special name protection factor (PROFAC). Thus, the PROFAC represents the
removal efficiency via intercellular signaling mechanisms of existing problematic
cells among the problematic cells present. The PROFAC is considered to relate to
-adaptation but its magnitude may be influenced by I-adaptation.
Using our NEOTRANS2
model, which includes a protective bystander effect via
apoptosis, we have found a rather large StoThresh for gamma-ray-induced neoplastic
transformation of HeLa x skin fibroblast human hybrid cells. Others (Kondo 1999;
Feinendegen et al. 2000; Tanooka 2000; Yamamoto and Seyama 2000; Feinendegen
and Pollycove 2001) also put forth the notion that a threshold for radiation-induced
excess stochastic effects could arise from such a protective mechanisms.
In the current version ofNEOTRANS2, the misrepair pathway is assumed to apply
only for a dose rate in excess of a critical value c*. This has been changed in the
model to account for others' observation that chronically administered (low-dose
rate) low-LET irradiation appears to induce cancer (at certain sites in the body) only
after very large radiation doses, if at all (Ootsuyama and Tanooka 1991, 1993; Rossi
and Zaider 1997; Yamamato et at. 1998; Kondo 1999; Yamamato and Seyauia 200();
Tokarskaya et at. 2002).
Harold Rossi and Marco Zaider (1997) critically reviewed the literature on
radiogenic lung cancer and concluded that "at radiation doses generally of concern
in radiation protection « 2 Gy), protracted exposure to low-LET radiation (x- or
-rays) does not appear to cause lung cancer. There is, in fact, indication of a
reduction of the natural incidence."
Hoel and Li (1998) have demonstrated that use of a threshold-type, dose-re-
sponse model leads to better characterization of both the leukemia incidence and
mortality data for atomic bomb survivors than use of the LNT model. In addition,
Zoya Tokarskaya and colleagues (1995, 1997) reported a threshold close to 1 Gy for
lung cancer induction by alpha radiation, based on Mayak workers who inhaled
plutonium-239. R. E. Rowland (1994) has reported a large threshold for bone
cancer induction by alpha radiation based on data for radium dial painters.
The recent Hanford Thyroid Disease Study did not find evidence for any excess
risk of thyroid cancer induction for persons who were exposed to radioactive iodine
released from the Hanford facility (USDHHS 2002). For doses in the range of 0 to
100 mGy, risk was not correlated with dose and was less than for the control group
based on persons outside what was considered the irradiation zone. Further, for
several health effects, the mean slope of the risk vs. dose relationship was negative.
It is important to point out implications of our findings related to low-dose
risk assessment for chronic exposure. Firstly, G-adaptation can lead to protec-
tion of the cellular community from low-dose-induced stochastic effects. How-
ever, there is a possibility that some risk gains and risk losses can occur. Persons
who would have developed spontaneous cancers may be protected by low-dose
exposure, while others exposed and who would not have developed spontaneous
cancer may have added risk (likely very small if any) for cancer induction.
114 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.1, 2003
Mechanistic Basis for Nonlinear Dose Response
The net population effect could be a reduction in the number of cancer cases
after low-dose exposure, but the subgroup that would not have developed spon-
taneous cancers might have a higher cancer incidence. This poses some "food
for thought" for the future discussion of protecting the public from low doses of
genotoxic agents.
The NEOTRANS2
model has also been adapted for ethylene oxide (EO)-induced
mutations in T cells of mice after inhalation exposure to a genotoxic chemical
(Walker etat. 2002). The In ternational Agency for Research on Cancer has classified
EO (an immediate oxidative metabolite of ethylene, a normal body constituent) as
a Group 1 human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence in animals with strong
evidence in humans ofa relevant carcinogenic mechanisms, rather than on support
from epidemiological studies of EO-exposed workers (!ARC 1994). For application
to chemicals such as EO, the variable c then becomes the time-dependent exposure
concentration or dose rate (e.g., for a critical metabolite) to target tissue. The
indicated adapted model, called NEOTRANS
2-EO,
includes a postulated threshold
concentration for the induction ofintercellular signaling that leads to the protective
bystander apoptosis effect as well a second threshold for excess mutations (Walker
et at. 2002).
We have explained the low-dose protective effects against radiation-induced
neoplastic transformation as being due to a bystander apoptosis effect. Another
possible explanation would be the induction ofa highly efficient repair process that
is not available at background levels of irradiation. However, we do not consider the
notion ofinduced efficient repair adequate to explain a decrease in risk for neoplas-
tic transformation. For one reason, the induced repair process may not be highly
efficient (for protecting against problematic cells) as recently demonstrated
(Oudalova et at. 2002). The cited researchers demonstrated that moderate doses (>
400 mGy) induce a system ofSOS response leading to elevated survival and elevated
yield of chromosomal aberrations among surviving cells (meristem cells of spring
barley). Secondly, with induced efficient repair, plating efficiency for low-dose-
irradiated cells should then be significantly higher than for controls, which appears
not to be the case.
It is important to mention the issue of genetic sensitivity. Some humans are
highly sensitive to low-dose radiation-induced stochastic effects, due to inherited
abnormalities in DNA repair. How the protective bystander apoptosis effect pre-
sented here relates to such individuals has not been resolved. One could speculate
that such individuals would have high frequency of spontaneous neoplastic trans-
formations. If so, how these individuals will be affected by low-dose radiation or
low-dose chemicals would be expected to depend on their ability to mount a
protective response via apoptosis. Since both DNA repair and apoptosis are regu-
lated through signaling pathways that involve p53, it is possible that persons with
inherited deficiencies in DNA repair will also have deficiencies in apoptosis. If so,
such individuals may not benefit from the protective bystander apoptosis effect
discussed.

CONCLUSIONS
Nonlinearity in the dose-response relationship for the risk of radiation- (or
chemical-) induced problematic, nonlethal mutations and neoplastic transforma-
tion could arise via several mechanisms:
1. The induction of a protective bystander apoptosis effect whereby existing
problematic cells are selectively eliminated.
2. Only error-free repair below a specific dose rate with misrepair occurring
above that dose rate.
3. An induction ofan error-prone repair process above a dose threshold whereby
cells with significant genomic damage are more likely to survive. This would
be expected to lead to an increase in mutations and neoplastic transforma-
tions and possibly for cancer cases (rather than a decrease).
Both 1 and 2 above would be expected to lead to a threshold for excess (relative
to the spontaneous level) problematic mutations, excess neoplastic transformation,
and possibly for excess cancers.
