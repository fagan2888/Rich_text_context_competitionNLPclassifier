Context.--Although elder mistreatment is suspected to be life threatening in
some instances, little is known about the survival of elderly persons who have been
mistreated.
Objective.--To estimate the independent contribution of reported elder abuse
and neglect to all-cause mortality in an observational cohort of community-dwelling
older adults.
Design.--Prospective cohort study with at least 9 years of follow-up.
Setting and Patients.--The New Haven Established Population for Epidemio-
logic Studies in the Elderly cohort, which included 2812 community-dwelling adults
who were older than 65 years in 1982, a subset of whom were referred to protec-
tive services for the elderly.
Main Outcome Measures.--All-cause mortality among (1) elderly persons for
whom protective services were used for corroborated elder mistreatment (elder
abuse, neglect, and/or exploitation), or (2) elderly persons for whom protective ser-
vices were used for self-neglect.
Results.--In the first 9 years after cohort inception, 176 cohort members were
seen by elderly protective services for verified allegations; 10 (5.7%) of these were
for abuse, 30 (17.0%) for neglect, 8 (4.5%) for exploitation, and 128 (72.7%) for
self-neglect. At the end of a 13-year follow-up period from cohort inception, cohort
members seen for elder mistreatment at any time during the follow-up had poorer
survival (9%) than either those seen for self-neglect (17%) or other noninvestigated
cohort members (40%) (P.001). In a pooled logistic regression that adjusted for
demographic characteristics, chronic diseases, functional status, social networks,
cognitive status, and depressive symptomatology, the risk of death remained
elevated for cohort members experiencing either elder mistreatment (odds ratio,
3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-6.7) or self-neglect (odds ratio, 1.7; 95%
confidence interval, 1.2-2.5), when compared with other members of the cohort.
Conclusions.--Reported and corroborated elder mistreatment and self-neglect
are associated with shorter survival after adjusting for other factors associated with
increased mortality in older adults.

protective services for the elderly from
Connecticut, which was the official en-
tity charged with the investigation of
suspected elder mistreatment. The goal
was to identify features of older adults
that would predict subsequent elder

Protective Services for the Elderly
in Connecticut
Connecticut has the oldest mandatory
elder abuse reporting law in the United
States, enacted in 1978 (4 years before
inception of the New Haven EPESE co-
hort). The law defines a group of manda-
tory reporters who are likely to have fre-
quent contact with older adults by virtue
of their occupation (such as physicians,
nurses,and socialservice providers), and
might therefore be in a position to iden-
tify cases of suspected elder abuse. Re-
ports are made to a regional ombudsman
intheelderlyprotectiveservicesdivision
who makes an on-site visit to the elderly
person to interview the client and any
other involved party. Based on the infor-
mation obtained, the ombudsman veri-
fiesorrefutesasuspicionofmistreatment
and assigns 1 or more of 3 designations
to a case: abuse, neglect (including self-
neglect), or exploitation. Elder abuse is
definedasthewillfulinflictionofphysical
pain, injury, or mental anguish, or the
willful deprivation by a caretaker of ser-
vices necessary to maintain physical and
mental health. Neglect is defined as an
elderly person alone who is not able to
provide himself/herself the services nec-
essary to maintain physical and mental
health, or who is not receiving those ser-
vicesfromaresponsiblecaretaker.Thus,
under Connecticut definitions it is pos-
sible to be self-neglected. Exploitation is
defined as taking advantage of an older
adult for monetary gain or profit.
The ombudsman then develops a cli-
ent-specific care plan that is typically
multidisciplinary in nature and is in-
tended to ensure safety while maximiz-
ing the autonomy of the older adult. In-
terventionsvaryandmightincludehome
care, physician or other health care clini-
cian referral, pursuit of guardianship, or
nursing home placement.
Identification of Cohort Members
Seen by the Ombudsman
Weperformedamanualrecordmatch-
ing of EPESE and Connecticut Ombuds-
man/Elderly Protective Service records
to determine if any cohort members had
been seen by the ombudsman during an
11-year follow-up period from cohort in-
ception (1982-1992 inclusive). This
manual matching was performed in such
a way as to protect the confidentiality of
all subjects involved (ie, so that elderly
protective services had no knowledge of
who EPESE cohort members were and
EPESE investigators had no knowledge
of which cohort members might have
beenseenbyelderlyprotectiveservices).
The protocol was approved by the insti-
tutional review board, and the final
merged data set (which contained the
standardized EPESE data merged with
elderly protective services­derived in-
formation about the nature of the prob-
lems noted by the ombudsman in the
home investigation) had no information
that would permit the identification of
any party.
Strategy of Analysis
After cohort members who were seen
by protective services for the elderly
were identified, weighted 13-year sur-
vival curves from cohort inception were
constructed for 3 subgroups of subjects:
(1) those found to have sustained veri-
fied elder mistreatment (abuse, neglect,
and/or exploitation) by another person,
(2) those seen by protective services for
corroborated self-neglect, or (3) other
members of the cohort who had no con-
tactwithelderlyprotectiveservices.Co-
hort members who were seen by the om-
budsman, but who had no verified com-
plaintswereexcluded.Allanalyseswere
weighted and adjusted for the sampling
design of the cohort.8
Multivariate analysis was conducted
with all-cause mortality as the depen-
dent variable. The goal of multivariate
analysis was to estimate the indepen-
dent contribution of reported and cor-
roboratedeldermistreatmentorself-ne-
glect to all-cause mortality after adjust-
ing for other factors known to predict
mortality. The group of cohort members
not seen by protective services for any
reasonservedasthereferentgroup.The
categories of covariate characteristics
were demographic (age, sex, race, edu-
cation, and income); health related (self-
reported chronic conditions including
myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer,
diabetes,hypertension,andhipfracture,
as well as body mass index in tertiles [a
measure of weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters];
physical functioning (number of activi-
ties of daily living impairments [0 to 7]
and number of Rosow-Breslau or Nagi
impairments [0 to 8])9,10; social networks
and support (number of social ties,
including marital status, frequent con-
tact with friends and relatives, regular
attendance at religious services, and
participation in social or community
groups, and number of sources of emo-
tional support; cognitive performance
(Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental Status
Questionnaire [SPMSQ]11); and psycho-
social domains (Center for Epidemio-
logical Studies Depression Scale12). For
body mass index and household income,
which had more than 5% missing data,
dummy variables were created for the
missingdatasothatthe2measurescould
be retained in the model.
Pooledlogisticregression13 wasusedto
allow for updating the independent vari-
ables,includingreferraltoelderlyprotec-
tive services as well as characteristics as-
certainedintheEPESEinterviews(such
as depression scores and chronic condi-
tions). Proportional hazards regression
couldnotbeusedbecausethedatadidnot
meettheassumptions.Manyofthepoten-
tial confounders of the association be-
tween elder mistreatment and mortality
were assessed at only the triennial face-
to-face interviews, so we used 9 years of
follow-up divided into three 3-year inter-
vals. According to this strategy, each of 3
observation periods (1982-1985, 1985-
1988, and 1988-1991) was included as a
separate record for each subject in the
pooled sample. For each record, the co-
variates were updated using the sub-
ject's status at the beginning of the inter-
val. Likewise, the 3-level protective
services variable (no contact with protec-
tive services for the elderly, corrobo-
rated self-neglect, and corroborated mis-
treatmentbyanotherparty)wasupdated
foreachintervalbyusingthedatesofom-
budsman investigation. The outcome for
eachintervalwaswhetherthesubjectdied
during that interval. Subjects who died
were dropped from subsequent inter-
vals. Subjects who were seen by the om-
budsman but had no verified complaints
during follow-up (n=38) were excluded
fromintervalssubsequenttotheirfirstin-
vestigation, although we examined their
survival separately.
A series of 7 hierarchical models was
constructedtosequentiallyadjustfordo-
mains of potential confounders of the as-
sociation between elder mistreatment or

As ascertainment of mortality is vir-
tually complete for the New Haven
EPESE cohort, we also examined the
distribution of the cause of death for the
3 groups of cohort members previously
described. Cause of death was deter-
mined from death certificate data.
RESULTS
The number of verified and nonveri-
fied mistreatment and self-neglect
events over the follow-up period are
shown in Figure 1. By year 8 of follow-
up,90%ofthetotalmistreatmentevents

The 13-year survival curves for the 3
groups are shown in Figure 2. While at
the beginning of the follow-up period
(years 1-5) survival rates were similar,
at the end of follow-up, cohort members

survival (9%) than either those seen for
self-neglect (17%) or those cohort mem-
bers who had no contact with protective
services for the elderly (40%) (P.001

subjectswhohadnonverifiedallegations
(39%) was not significantly different
than the cohort numbers who were not
seen by protective services.
Table 1 shows the 3-year pooled bivar-
iate risk of death for several covariates

mortality (older age, male, lower educa-

impairment, and depressive symptom-
atology). In bivariate analysis, elder mis-
treatment also was significantly associ-

ment was associated with a significantly
higher risk of death than self-neglect.
The results of hierarchical pooled lo-
gistic regression are shown in Table 3.
The risk of death adjusted only for the
interval of follow-up was substantial for
bothsubjectswhoweremistreated(OR,
5.1;95%confidenceinterval[CI],2.8-9.5)
as well as those who were self-neglected
(OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.3-4.2). Subsequent
models show the influence of adjusting
for demographic characteristics, func-
tional status, social networks, cognitive
status,anddepressivesymptomatology.
In general these models decreased the
magnitudeoftheassociationbetweenel-
der mistreatment and all-cause mortal-
ity, with demographic characteristics
and functional status having the great-
estinfluenceontheORs.However,after
adjusting for all these covariates, the
risk of death remained elevated for both
cohortmembersexperiencingeldermis-
treatment (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-6.7) and
those seen for self-neglect (OR, 1.7; 95%
CI, 1.2-2.5), when compared with other
members of the cohort.
The most common causes of death for
these 3 groups are shown in Table 4. In
general, the major causes of death were
similarly distributedamongthe3groups.
Notably,nodeathineitherthemistreated
group or the self-neglected group was
deemed to be due to injury.

proportion of deaths occurring in long-
term care facilities for all 3 groups (Table
5). While those subjects experiencing
self-neglect were more likely to die in a
nursing home compared with uninvesti-
gated subjects, those experiencing mis-
treatment were not.
COMMENT
This longitudinal study is the first to
examine mortality in a well-character-
izedcohortofcommunity-dwellingolder
adults, a subset of whom both have been
referred to protective services and have
experiencedeldermistreatment.There-
sults demonstrated a mortality gradient
inwhicholderadultswhohavebeenmis-
treated were more likely to be dead at
the end of a 13-year follow-up period
than either their self-neglected counter-
parts or those cohort members who had
no interaction with adult protective ser-
vices. Survival was similar at the begin-
ning of the study, but midway through
follow-up, the survival curves diverged.
Notably, the majority of mistreatment
eventshadoccurredinthecohortbythis
time, which may reflect a saturation ef-
fect in the pool of persons susceptible.
Additionally, a multivariable analysis
that controlled for other factors known
to be predictive of mortality in older
adults revealed that both the need for
protective service use generally and el-
der mistreatment specifically were in-
dependent predictors of early death.
Notably, no deaths in the mistreated
group were immediately ascribed to in-
jury. How then might elder mistreat-
ment confer additional risk for mortal-
ity? One possibility is that we did not
adequately adjust for the confounders
(eg, comorbidity) or did not identify all
confounders that might be associated
with mortality, such as noncompliance
withmedicaltreatmentorpooraccessto
medical care. For example, malnutrition
might be associated with many of the
covariates in these models, but was only
indirectly assessed through body mass
index. Comorbidity adjustment in this
study was through self-report of 7 medi-
calconditions,whichislessaccuratethan
medical record­based abstraction. An-
other possibility is that protective ser-
vice use and elder mistreatment repre-
sent comprehensive markers of frailty
notcapturedbytraditionalconstructsof
the older adult at risk. It may do this by
amalgamating, individually, high-risk
featuresknowntobeassociatedwithad-
verse outcomes such as poor functional
status, cognitive impairment, and pov-

erty into an identifiable composite char-
acteristic that is easily measured.
An intriguing, but somewhat specula-
tive, hypothesis derives from the grow-
ingbodyofliteratureontherelationship
between various forms of interpersonal
stress (sometimes termed negative so-
cial support) and individual well-being.
Research has consistently shown that
negativeinterpersonalinteractionswith
networkmembersstronglypredictava-
rietyofnegativepsychologicaloutcomes
and are strongly related to distress.14-18
The caregiver burden associated with
caring for a frail or demented loved one
may lead to mistreatment in some situ-
ations.19 Although research using mor-
tality as an outcome is lacking, it seems
plausible that experiencing elder abuse
isanextremeformofnegativesocialsup-
port. In the same manner that social in-
tegration reduces mortality, it may con-
versely be the case that the extreme in-
terpersonal stress resulting from elder
abuse situations may confer additional
death risk. Future research that exam-
ines this hypothesis is greatly needed.
Nursing home placement is an inter-
vention that is frequently implemented
for egregious adult protective services
cases involving both mistreatment and/
or self-neglect. This study had limited
follow-up of deaths occurring in long-
term care facilities, but in general, self-
neglecting older adults were more likely
to die in long-term care facilities than
either mistreated subjects or those who
hadnocontactwithadultprotectiveser-
vices. Unfortunately, the numbers in
this study were small, and we believe
that defining the outcomes of long-term
care placement for adult protective ser-
vice clients of all types is a crucial area of
study,sincenursinghomeplacementisa
radical, restrictive, and expensive inter-
vention.Itisalsooneofthemostdifficult
decisions that adult protective services
workers and elder abuse field workers
face in their jobs. More objective data on
whenitisappropriateandefficaciousare
greatly needed.
Another limitation of this study is that

ondeathcertificates,eitherunawarethat
it existed or unaware that it might con-
tribute to death. This study argues that
it may. Additionally, we have no way of
adjustingforlengthofabusebecausepro-
tective service referral does not indicate
when mistreatment began, only when it
became known to an official agency.
In summary, reported elder mistreat-
ment confers additional death risk.
Whether multidisciplinary interven-
tionsdirectedatstoppingeldermistreat-
ment would avert the associated in-
creased mortality is an area worthy of
further investigation.

older adults.
