Personality may influence the risk of death, but the evidence remains inconsistent. We examined associations
between personality traits of the five-factor model (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and
openness to experience) and the risk of death from all causes through individual-participant meta-analysis of 76,150
participants from 7 cohorts (the British Household Panel Survey, 2006­2009; the German Socio-Economic Panel
Study, 2005­2010; the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, 2006­2010; the US Health and
Retirement Study, 2006­2010; the Midlife in the United States Study, 1995­2004; and the Wisconsin Longitudi-
nal Study's graduate and sibling samples, 1993­2009). During 444,770 person-years at risk, 3,947 participants
(54.4% women) died (mean age at baseline = 50.9 years; mean follow-up = 5.9 years). Only low conscientiousness--
reflecting low persistence, poor self-control, and lack of long-term planning--was associated with elevated mortal-
ity risk when taking into account age, sex, ethnicity/nationality, and all 5 personality traits. Individuals in the lowest
tertile of conscientiousness had a 1.4 times higher risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.18,
1.58) compared with individuals in the top 2 tertiles. This association remained after further adjustment for health
behaviors, marital status, and education. In conclusion, of the higher-order personality traits measured by the five-
factor model, only conscientiousness appears to be related to mortality risk across populations.

Personality is associated with various health outcomes
(1­4), and some studies suggest that personality differences
may also predict mortality risk (5­8). Personality represents
enduring individual dispositions in domains of emotional
reactivity, behavioral tendencies, and cognitive styles (9, 10).
Mortality risk, in turn, quantifies the total illness burden that
accumulates from multiple health risk factors. Thus, investi-
gating associations between personality traits and mortality may
provide insight into the most important links between per-
sonality and overall health (9, 11).
However, as illustrated by a recent literature review on per-
sonality and mortality (10), few studies have examined mor-
tality risk by using all the major dimensions of personality
variation at the same time. With some notable exceptions (6,
12­14), these studies have been based on nonrepresentative
and relatively small samples (10, 15) (i.e., data that are par-
ticularly vulnerable to chance findings and publication bias).
Given these limitations, currentlyavailable evidence is not yet
sufficient for evaluating the public health relevance of per-
sonality dimensions in explaining mortality differentials.
To undertake an assessment of the association between
personality and mortality, we pooled individual-participant
data from 7 cohort studies and performed a meta-analysis to
examine whether personality traits of the five-factor model

accepted and validated conceptualization of personality (16),
and it includes 5 higher-order personality traits--extraversion,
neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to
experience--that are assumed to capture the main dimensions
of personality variation among individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We searched the datacollections of the Inter-UniversityCon-
sortium for Political and Social Research (http://www.icpsr.
umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/) and the Economic and Social
Data Service (http://ukdataservice.ac.uk/) to identify eligible
large-scale prospective cohort studies on personalityand mor-
tality. The studies had to include information on participants'
vital status and personality assessed with at least the brief 15-
item questionnaire based on the five-factor model. We located 7
suchdatasets,asfollows:theBritishHouseholdandPanelSurvey
(n = 13,823)(17);theGermanSocio-EconomicPanel(GSOEP)
Study (n = 20,434) (18); the Household, Income and Labour
DynamicsinAustralia(HILDA)Survey(n =11,091)(19);theUS
Health and Retirement Study (n =13,900) (20); the Midlife
intheUnited States(MIDUS) Study(n = 6,259)(21); theWis-
consin Longitudinal Study graduate sample (n = 6,674); and
the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study sibling sample (n = 3,969)
(22). These are well-characterized, longitudinal cohort studies

ality and all-cause mortality have been reported previously in
the MIDUS sample (12) but not in the other data sets. Meth-
odological details of the cohorts are provided in the Web
Appendix, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/.
In all studies, personality was assessed by using standard-
ized questionnaire instruments based on the five-factor model
of personality (16). The instruments measure 5 higher-order
personality traits that sum up individual variation in several,
more specific, lower-order personality dispositions. Extraver-
sion reflects characteristics such as social assertiveness, socia-
bility, and sensitivity to positive emotions; neuroticism is
associated with low emotional stability, sensitivity to neg-
ative emotions, and anxiety proneness; agreeableness measures
cooperativeness, altruism, and trust toward other people; con-
scientiousness is expressed as self-control, orderliness, and
adherence to social norms; and openness to experience cor-
relates with curiosity, broad-ranging interests, and open-
mindedness.
Covariates included in the analyses were ethnicity/nationality
(0 = white or non-Hispanic and 1 = other; except in the HILDA
Survey and the GSOEP Study, in which 0 = native born and
1 = non­native born); education (0 = primary level/less than
high school, 1 = secondary level/high school, and 3 = tertiary
level/higher degree); marital status (0 = married/cohabiting
and 1 = single); leisure-time physical inactivity (0 = moderate
or high physical activity and 1 = low or no physical activity);
current smoking (0 = nonsmoker and 1 = smoker); heavy alco-
hol consumption (frequent alcohol consumption or alcohol
problems, depending on the study); and obesity (body mass
index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) 30 calculated from self-
reported height and weight).
Associations between personality traits and mortality were
estimated by using Cox's proportional hazards model. On the
basis of Schoenfeld residuals, we found no violation of the
proportional hazards assumption for any personality trait in
any cohort (all P > 0.08). Hazard ratios were calculated for both
continuously coded standardized personality scores (mean = 0;
standard deviation, 1) and for personality scores categorized
into quintiles. Personality traits were examined both separately
and after mutual adjustment, and all models were furtheradjusted
for sex, age at baseline, and ethnicity/nationality. To examine
thecombinedrolesofsmoking,physicalinactivity,alcoholuse,
and obesity, wecreatedacategorical sum scoreof the 4dichot-
omous indicators of these variables and used this in the anal-
ysis.Analysesincludingothercovariateswerecarriedoutwith
slightly smaller sample sizes because of missing covariate data.
To explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the associa-
tions, we undertook the proportional hazards models in dif-
ferent subgroups separately in each cohort, and the results from
these subgroup analyses were then pooled. Although explor-
atory, these analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing.
In sensitivity analyses, we fitted proportional hazards models
by using cubic splines to examine potential nonlinear associ-
ations between personality traits and mortality risk in more
detail than was allowed by categorization of personality scores.
Each trait modeled with cubic splines was examined sepa-
rately, adjusting for the other 4 personality traits (coded as
linear covariates), as well as sex, age, and ethnicity/nationality.
The pooled analysis for these models was carried out with
1-step meta-analysis, that is, by first pooling the data and then
fitting the models, stratified by study. Cubic splines with 3,
4, and 5 knots were examined; the results are presented for
the 3-knot models because additional knots did not substan-
tially improve the model fit.
All models were first fitted separately within each cohort,
and the results from the individual cohorts were then pooled
by using random-effects meta-analysis. Standard errors in
cohorts based on household sampling were calculated by using
a robust estimator method to take into account the non-
independence of individuals from the same households. Het-
erogeneity in the effect sizes was examined on the basis of
I2 estimates. Meta-analysis was conducted by using the metan
package of Stata, version 12.1, software (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics for the cohorts are presented in Web
Table 1. The mean age at baseline was 50.9 years, and 54.4%
subjects were women. In total, there were 3,947 deaths during
a follow-up of approximately 444,770 person-years at risk
(mean follow-up = 5.9 years; lack of information on exact
dates of death in the MIDUS Study precluded exact calcula-
tion). Kaplan-Meier plots of cumulative mortality risk in the
cohorts are shown in Web Figure 1, and correlations between
personality traits are reported in Web Table 2.
Associations between continuous personalityscores and mor-
tality risk showed that low conscientiousness was the only per-
sonality trait independently associated with higher mortality
risk (Figure 1). This association was observed across studies

fairly consistently, albeit not in all studies. In the pooled anal-
ysis, a conscientiousness score 1 standard deviation below
themeanwasassociatedwitha14%highermortalityrisk(haz-
ard ratio (HR) = 1 / 0.88 = 1.14). When not adjusted for the
other personality traits, lower extraversion, higher neuroticism,
and lower agreeableness were also associated with elevated
mortality risk (model 1 in Web Table 3). Neuroticism and
agreeableness were no longer associated with mortality when
adjusted for conscientiousness (model 2 in Web Table 3), and
only conscientiousness remained associated with mortality when
all personality traits were included in the model (Figure 1; model
3 in Web Table 3). Adjustment for baseline health behaviors
and obesity accounted for one-fifth of the association between
low conscientiousness and mortality risk (Table 1), whereas
education and marital status attenuated the association by less
than 10%. Together, the covariates attenuated the hazard ratio
of conscientiousness by 31%.
There was moderate to large heterogeneity in the effect
sizes across studies for conscientiousness (I2 = 73%), extra-
version (I2 = 65%), neuroticism (I2 = 54%), and agreeable-
ness (I2 = 65%). The initial heterogeneity for openness to
experience (I2 = 70%) was reduced to 0% when the GSOEP
cohort was excluded from the analysis. To examine whether
interaction effects between different personality traits accounted
for any of the heterogeneity, we examined all the possible trait
combinations (e.g., whether the association between extra-
version and mortality risk was dependent on the other 4 per-
sonality traits). Of the 70 interaction effects tested, only 5 were
statistically significant at conventional levels (data not shown),
and none of these was sufficiently consistent across studies.
We did not pursue these exploratory analyses further because
we had no specific hypotheses regarding trait interactions.
Subgroup analysis
Subgroup analyses indicated that the association between
higher conscientiousness and lower mortality risk did not differ
by sex, ethnic/national majority versus minority, age, educa-
tional level, number of behavior-related health risks, or self-
reported general health at baseline (Web Table 4). For the other
4 personality traits, the above subgroup analyses also suggested
no systematic sources of heterogeneity in the effect sizes (Web
Table 4). Of the 40 interaction tests undertaken, only 2 were
statisticallysignificant (P < 0.05),andbothinvolvedgeographical
location; conscientiousness was not associated with mortality
in the Australian sample (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.14),
although higher extraversion was associated with lower mor-
tality in the Australian sample (HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.75,
0.98) but not in the European or US samples. However, these
results need to be interpreted in light of the fact that the Aus-
tralian estimate was based on only 1 study, and that 38 other
interactions were tested at the same time with no adjustment
for multiple testing.
Tests for nonlinearity
In the pooled analysis based on quintiles of personality scores
(Figure 2), low conscientiousness was the only personality trait
independently associated with higher mortality risk. Com-
pared with individuals in the highest quintile of conscientious-
ness, individuals in the lowest quintile had 1.52 (95% CI: 1.15,
1.96) times higher mortality risk (note that, in Figure 2, the
lowest quintile is the reference group). Differences in mortal-
ity risk were largest when comparing individuals who scored
below versus above the mean of conscientiousness and were
smaller among individuals scoring above the mean; catego-
rization of individuals into low (the lowest tertile) versus high
(2 of the highest tertiles) conscientiousness in each cohort
indicated a pooled hazard ratio of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.58)
higher mortality risk in participants with low compared with
high conscientiousness in the total sample.
Regression analyses based on cubic splines suggested that
scores for extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to
experience that were below the mean level, and scores for neu-
roticism and agreeableness that were above the mean level, might
be more strongly related to mortality risk than theresults based
on overall linear association across the total range of personality
scores (Web Figures 2­6). When assessed with linear models
that allowed the associationstovary below versus above the mean
level of personality score, the association for conscientious-
ness was slightly stronger below the mean (HR = 0.85, 95%
CI: 0.78, 0.92) than above the mean (HR = 0.92, 95% CI:
0.86,1.00)ofconscientiousness(Pfordifference = 0.09)(Web
Table 5). Higher neuroticism (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.22)
and higheragreeableness (HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.17) above
the respective mean levels for each trait were weakly associ-
ated with higher mortality risk, whereas no associations were
observed for neuroticism and agreeableness scores below the
mean level (P for difference of below vs. above the mean = 0.07
for both personality traits; Web Table 5).
Reverse causality
Deteriorating health in the years before death might
decrease conscientiousness, and such reverse causal effects
couldbiastheassociationbetweenconscientiousnessandsub-
sequent mortality risk. To evaluate reverse causation bias, we
examined whether the hazard ratio of conscientiousness was
affected when deaths occurring near the time of personal-
ity assessment were excluded from the analysis (the MIDUS
cohort was excluded because of lack of information on date
of death). The association remained largely unchanged when
censoring from the analysis all 621 deaths occurring within 1
year (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.91), all 1,753 deaths occur-
ring within 3 years (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.91), or all
2,922 deaths occurring within 5 years (HR = 0.90, 95% CI:
0.85, 0.96) of the personality assessment. This finding pro-
vides evidence against bias due to reverse causality.
DISCUSSION
With a pooled sample of more than 76,000 individuals from
the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Aus-
tralia, this is the first individual-participant meta-analysis of
personality and mortality. Our findings suggest that low consci-
entiousness is associated with an increased risk of death from
all causes. Individuals in the lowest tertile of conscientiousness
had a 37% higher mortality rate than individuals in the 2 higher
tertiles of conscientiousness. The other 4 personality traits--
extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, and openness to
experience--were not consistently associated with mortality

ally adjusted, although some statistically significant associations
were observed in individual studies.
Thefive-factormodelandotherdetailedframeworksofper-
sonality composition started to receive wider attention only in
the 1990s (16), which is why many long-running cohort studies
have assessed personality with more limited instruments--often
restrictedtothetraitsofextraversionandneuroticism(23).Given
the need for sufficient mortality follow-up, the health conse-
quences of conscientiousness have received detailed attention
only quite recently (24). The present finding on low conscien-
tiousness and elevated mortality risk is in agreement with a pre-
vious literature-based meta-analysis of nearly 9,000 individuals
from 20 studies, in which conscientiousness-related traits were
assessedwithdifferentmeasures(15).Thepresentstudyincludes
unpublished studies and is based on a larger sample, adding to
the previous meta-analysis and suggesting that the association
between conscientiousness and mortality risk may be weaker
than previously estimated. The previous meta-analysis (15)
reported a pooled odds ratio estimate of 0.64 (transformed
from a correlation-based effect size of r = -0.11, 95% CI:
-0.17, -0.05), and another literature review reported a similar
pooled estimate of r = -0.09 (equal to an approximate OR of
0.72) between conscientiousness and mortality risk (10). Thus,
the effect magnitude of a hazard ratio of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82,
0.94)per1­standarddeviationincrementinconscientiousness
estimated in our analysis is only about one-half to one-third
of the previously estimated effect magnitudes. This differ-
ence is similar to previously observed discrepancies between
effect sizes in published versus unpublished data in other
domains of psychosocial risks (25).
To test whether biological and behavioral mechanisms
underlie the associations between low conscientiousness and
mortality risk, we adjusted the analyses for current smoking,
physical inactivity, heavy alcohol use, and obesity. The 21%
reduction in mortality risk after this adjustment suggests that
theassociationofconscientiousnesswithmortalityismediated
in part via well-established biological and behavioral factors
(26­28). It has been hypothesized that highly conscientious
individuals are more likely to follow social norms and public
health recommendations concerning health behaviors (29).
Given that conscientious individuals also have higher levels
of self-discipline, it is reasonable to assume that they are also
more likely to adhere to health and treatment recommendations
provided by health professionals (30). The adjusted covariates
in the present study did not fully explain the association, so sev-
eralothermechanismsmayalsounderlietheassociationbetween
conscientiousness and mortality risk, including mental and cog-
nitive functioning (31), immune and endocrine system function-
ing (32, 33), and genetic liability (34).
The current study places conscientiousness as a risk factor
almost on par with some common health behaviors and socio-
demographic risks for premature death. Heavy smoking more
than doubles mortality risk, whereas light smoking increases
mortality risk by 50% (35, 36). Physical inactivity versus rec-
ommended moderate physical activity has been associated with
an increase in all-cause mortality risk with a relative risk of

who have a high school education or more, individuals who
have a lower educational level have an average 1.46 (95% CI:

sive disorder, which is related to personality traits of high neu-

low extraversion (r = -0.25) (3) is associated with elevated
mortality risk (relative risk =1.81, 95% CI: 1.58, 2.07) (40).

1.37-fold (95% CI: 1.18, 1.58) elevated risk of death observed
in the present analysis among individuals who have low con-
scientiousness (the lowest tertile) compared with high con-
scientiousness (the 2 highest tertiles).
Assuming that the association between conscientiousness
and mortality was causal, the population mortality rate would
decrease by 11% in the hypothetical absence of low conscien-
tiousness in the population (population attributable risk frac-
tion =[P × (HR ­ 1)] / [1 + P × (HR ­ 1)], with P = 1/3 and
HR =1.37). Interventions in children and adolescents have
been effective in increasing self-control, a subcomponent of the
broader conscientiousness trait, by an average of 0.30 standard
deviations (41, 42). Assuming, again hypothetically, that the
long-term effects of such early interventions were 0.20 standard
deviations, and that these interventions were successfully tar-
geted at the lowest one-third of the conscientiousness distri-
bution, one could expect the proportion of individuals with low
conscientiousnessto drop to approximatelyone-fourth (assum-
ing normal distribution) and the mortality rate thereby to
decrease by 2.7% (proportion shift = [(PA
­ PB
) × (HR ­ 1)] /
[PA
× (HR ­ 1) + 1], with PA
= 1/3, PB
= 1/4, and HR = 1.37).
These crude calculations suggest that the decline in the popu-
lation mortality rate from reductions in low conscientiousness
would be equal in magnitude to decreasing smoking preva-
lence by 3 percentage points (from 20% to 17%) or to increas-
ing moderate physical activity by 13 percentage points (from
50% to 63%) in current populations. However, evidence on
the feasibility of long-term interventions to change personal-
ity is limited.
Many early theories of personality and health have empha-
sized the role of negative emotionality (i.e., high neuroticism)
and interpersonal hostility (i.e., low agreeableness) in precip-
itating poor health (1). A literature-based meta-analysis of per-
sonality and all-cause mortality (10) suggested an increased
relativeriskofmortalityof1.15(95%CI:1.04,1.26)associated
with 1 standard deviation of difference in negative emotion-
ality (or high neuroticism) and an increased relative risk of mor-
tality of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.23) associated with 1 standard
deviation of difference in disagreeableness/hostility (or low
agreeableness). Surprisingly, we observed no differences in mor-
tality risk associated with the overall variation in neuroticism or
agreeableness, so our findings provide little support for these
hypotheses of personality and health with respect to mortality.
However,therewassomeevidencetosuggestthatveryhighneu-
roticism may be associated with an elevated risk of death; this
might reflect the heightened mortality risk associated with
clinical depression and other mental health problems (3, 40,
43). Very high agreeableness also had aweak association with
higher mortality, which is in contrast to most previous find-
ings suggesting that a higher level of interpersonal hostility
(i.e., low agreeableness) might be harmful for health (1, 10).
Given this unexpected direction of the association and the
number of tests conducted, the nonlinear pattern for agreeable-
ness identified by our analysis may represent a chance finding.
The present findings for openness to experience are in contrast
to a recent meta-analysis of 11 published studies (representing
19,941 subjects) (44), which suggested that higher openness
to experience is associated with lower mortality risk with an
odds ratio of 0.88 (transformed from acorrelation-based effect
size of r = 0.051). Among the present cohorts, higher openness
to experience was associated with lower mortality risk in only
1 study (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.91), and the pooled esti-
mate suggested no association (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.93,
1.06). In the future, a more detailed analysis comparing the
specificpersonality measures,theirassociationswithotherpre-
dictors of mortality (e.g., socioeconomic status), contextual
factors, and potential publication bias would be helpful to
increase understanding of these discrepancies in findings
across studies.
Our study does not exclude the possibility that the "Big
Five" personality traits may be associated with more specific
physical and mental diseases even if they are not associated
with mortality risk (1). Ourstudy is also limited by the fact that
personality was assessed by using only the 5 higher-order per-
sonality traits but not their more specific lower-order sub-
scales (16). It is possible that some of the higher-order traits
are too broad to identify mortality differences associated
with more specific lower-order personality trait subscales.
Literature-based meta-analyses may be subject to publication
bias resulting from selective reporting of positive findings. The
current data were pooled from all eligible large-scale longi-
tudinal studies that we were able to locate from 2 publicly avail-
able databases before performing any statistical analyses on
the individual cohorts. Thus, our sampling of the studies min-
imized publication bias. There was evidence of heterogene-
ity in effect sizes across studies, suggesting that some of the
variation in effect sizes may reflect true differences between
studies rather than random sampling error. Stratified analy-
ses for conscientiousness suggested no effect modification
by sociodemographic characteristics, including sex, age, and
education. It is possible that part of the effect of heterogene-
ity was related to the assessment of personality by using dif-
ferent personality inventories. However, this is an unlikely
source of major heterogeneity because different inventories
assessing the five-factor model personality traits have been
shown to be highly convergent (16, 45­48).
CONCLUSION
Although many personality dispositions have been associ-
ated with health outcomes (1, 9), the present results suggest
that low conscientiousness is the only higher-order personal-
ity trait of the five-factor model that predicts higher mortality
risk across populations. The magnitude of this association
appears to be weaker than previously estimated (15), which
may reflect heterogeneity in cohort characteristics, differences
in the personality instruments used to assess conscientious-
ness, and/or potential publication bias. Although personality
has been considered as a potential target for early-life inter-
ventions (41, 42), more detailed information on the feasibil-
ity, costs, and benefits of such interventions compared with
other interventions directed at specific health behaviors is
needed to further evaluate the significance of personality var-
iation as an opportunity to improve population health.
