Objective: This study examines whether overweight in midlife increases dementia risk later in life.
Methods: In 1963 body mass index was assessed in 1152 participants of The Swedish Twin Registry, at the age of 45­65 years.
These participants were later screened for dementia in a prospective study with up to 40 years follow-up. A total of 312
participants were diagnosed with dementia.
Results: Logistic regression analyses adjusted for demographic factors, smoking and alcohol habits, indicated that men and
women categorized as overweight in their midlife had an elevated risk of dementia (OR ¼ 1.59; 95% CI: 1.21­2.07, P ¼ 0.002),
Alzheimer's disease (OR ¼ 1.71; 95% CI: 1.24­2.35, P ¼ 0.003), and vascular dementia (OR ¼ 1.55; 95% CI: 0.98­2.47,
P ¼ 0.059). Further adjustments for diabetes and vascular diseases did not substantially affect the associations, except for
vascular dementia (OR ¼ 1.36; 95% CI: 0.82­2.56, P ¼ 0.116), reflecting the significance of diabetes and vascular diseases in the
etiology of vascular dementia. There was no significant interaction between overweight and APOE e4 status, indicating that
having both risk factors does not have a multiplicative effect with regard to dementia risk.
Conclusions: This study gives further support to the notion that overweight in midlife increases later risk of dementia. The risk is
increased for both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, and follows the same pattern for men and women.

Introduction
The long-term effects of overweight on physical health and
survival are well known. Recent research is now even
including potential negative effects on cognition in later
life.1­6 In two recent systematic review articles7,8 on over-
weight and risk of dementia it was proposed that high body
mass index (BMI) is independently associated with the risk of
dementia. According to the reviews, the studies that reported
significant associations had younger samples at baseline and
longer follow-up periods.
Overweight should be measured in midlife to reveal the
association with subsequent dementia because people often
lose weight before diagnosis9 and early in the dementia
phase.10 This fact is bound to blur the association between
overweight and dementia in older samples. Another reason
is that BMI is a better measure of adiposity in younger
samples as lean body mass is replaced by fat with increasing
age.11 Thus, it is possible for old people to have relatively low
BMI although they can have relatively high body fat. Finally,
and most importantly, measuring overweight in midlife may
reflect a more valid perspective on a person's lifelong
exposure to overweight, especially given the fact that most
people tend to gain rather than lose weight in adulthood.
Thus, when in the life course a risk factor for dementia is
measured, it determines whether and how the association is
characterized.12,13
Studies that have addressed potential sex differences in the
association between overweight and dementia risk indicate
that overweight may be a stronger risk factor for women
compared with men.3,14 Hayden et al.14 who used BMI in a
sample of people aged 65 years and older to predict incident
dementia, found an increased risk only for women; however,
the authors reported a problem with low statistical power in
the analyses of men. By using midlife assessment of BMI and
skinfold thickness,3 it was found that midlife BMI predicted
dementia among women only, whereas midlife skinfold
thickness predicted dementia in both sexes, suggesting that
BMI is an inaccurate measure of adiposity in men.

A related question is if overweight is differentially
associated with the most frequent types of dementia, that
is, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD).
This has only been examined in three studies.1,14,15 Two
studies reported that overweight increases the risk of AD and
not VaD in women.1,14 In the study of Whitmer et al.15
overweight (BMI between 25 and 30) increased the risk of AD
and VaD to the same extent (approximately a two-fold
increased risk), whereas obesity (BMIX30) was more strongly
related to VaD, indicating a five-fold risk, as compared with a
three-fold risk of AD. In a recent study by the same group,
midlife central obesity was found to predict dementia.4
In the investigation of the association between overweight
and dementia it is important to include all covariates that are
correlated with overweight and dementia and might affect
the association, such as age, sex, lifestyle factors (education,
smoking and alcohol consumption), diabetes, vascular
diseases and APOE e4 carrier status. The majority of the
studies addressing this issue include all relevant covariates,
with the exception of APOE e4 status.
The purpose of our study is to examine if overweight in
midlife is related to increased risk of dementia in later life.
We also examine if the risk is similar for men and women,
and if overweight is differentially related to AD and VaD.
Furthermore, the potential effect of APOE e4 allele will be
examined.
Methods
Participants
Data on BMI come from the initial surveys that were
administered to form the Swedish Twin Registry. The
Swedish Twin Registry was established in the late 1950s to
study smoking and alcohol consumption in relation to
potential risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.16,17 In
1963, the twins answered questionnaires covering various
environmental aspects including health and diseases, smok-
ing habits, alcohol consumption and information on weight
and height. Almost 30 years later, two longitudinal studies
on cognitive aging were conducted using the same twins
who participated in the survey in the sixties, The Swedish
Adoption/Twin Study of Aging18 (SATSA), starting in 1987,
and Origins of Variance in the Old­Old19 (OCTO-Twin),
starting in 1991. For the purpose of this study information
from the survey in the sixties and information from the
SATSA and OCTO-Twin studies have been linked. All
participants were informed about the study in accordance
with the ethics committee of the Karolinska Institute, the
Swedish Data Inspection Board, and the institutional board
at the University of Southern California or the Pennsylvania
State University.
The eligible participants for this study were all individuals
from the SATSA (n ¼ 767) and the OCTO-Twin study
(n ¼ 698) who were at the age 45­65 years at baseline in
1963 (born between 1898 and 1918) and who participated in
the survey in 1963 (N ¼ 1465). Out of these, all individuals
were included who had valid data on all variables and who
were screened for dementia (beginning in 1987 for SATSA,
n ¼ 484, and in 1991 for the OCTO-Twin study, n ¼ 668) and
tracked until 2005 or death. The total sample includes 1152
individuals (357 men and 795 women).
Overweight
Weight and height is based on information from the survey
in 1963. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight in kilos
by the height in square meters (kg/m2). Overweight is
normally defined as a BMI between 25 and 30, whereas
obesity is defined as a BMI greater than 30. In our sample,
however, less than 5% were obese according to this criterion.
To gain statistical power, we therefore applied a slightly
different categorization with BMI dichotomized into two
categories with the top 25% of the distribution defined as
overweight (BMIX26.5; coded as 1) and all others defined as
normal weight (coded as 0).
The information on heights and weights were self-
reported, which is potentially a subject to bias. However,
analyses completed in the SATSA comparing self-reported
and measured information on heights and weights (within a
1 year period) resulted in a correlation of 0.97 for height and
0.95 for weight.20 The mean differences (±s.d.) between self-
reported and measured values were 1.2±2.4 cm for height
and 0.8±4.0 kg for weight.
Dementia and vascular risk factors
The OCTO-Twin and the SATSA are longitudinal studies with
repeated assessments at a 2- to 3-year time schedules. Thus,
the participants have been evaluated continuously across the
study period with respect to dementia and vascular risk
factors.
Clinical diagnoses of dementia followed the DSM-III-R
criteria.21 All individuals were assessed with a cognitive test
battery during an in person visit. Individuals suspected for
dementia were given a diagnostic workup, including an
interview with an informant about memory and cognitive
problems, review of in person cognitive test protocols and
medical records.22 Findings were presented at a multi-
disciplinary consensus diagnosis conference, attended by
the clinicians and chaired by a psychologist who had not
met the participant. Subtypes of dementia were assigned
following NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for Alzheimer's disease23
and the NINDS-AIREN criteria for vascular dementia.24 All
clinical diagnoses were completed without reference to
neuroimaging. Prevalence rates of dementia in SATSA and
OCTO-Twin have been found to resemble other similar
studies such as the Kungsholmen study25 in Sweden, and the
Framingham study26 in the United States.
A total of 312 individuals received a dementia diagnosis:
181 were diagnosed with AD; 69 with VaD; and 62 with

mixed, secondary or unspecified dementia. Mean age at
recorded dementia diagnosis was 83 years (range 62­96
years), and did not differ between the normal weight and the
overweight groups.
The vascular risk factors of interest for this study are
smoking and alcohol habits, arterial hypertension, conges-
tive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes and stroke.
The information on smoking and alcohol habits comes from
the surveys in the sixties as well as from the longitudinal
aging studies (SATSA and OCTO-Twin). The smoking vari-
able was coded as 0 for non-smokers and 1 for current or
previous smokers. The alcohol variable was coded as 0 for
alcohol consumers and 1 for those who never use alcohol.
Information on diabetes and vascular diseases was obtained
through self-reports and through a review of medical
records. If there was any notification of a disease or a history
of self-report the person was coded as having the disease. The
following diseases were included in the analyses: hyperten-
sion, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes
and stroke (0 ¼ without the disease, 1 ¼ with the disease).
APOE e4 carrier status was coded as 0 for non-carriers of
the e4 allele and as 1 for those carrying 1 or 2 copies of the e4
allele. Information regarding APOE e4-carrier status was
available for only 732 individuals. Therefore, APOE e4 status
will not be included in the main analyses. However, it will be
included in one complementary analysis in which potential
interaction with overweight on dementia risk will be
examined.
Data analyses
Group differences between the normal weight group and
overweight group in background characteristics were ana-
lyzed with t-tests and w2-tests. Odds Ratio for dementia was
calculated using an extension of the generalized linear
model known as generalized linear mixed model (also
known as hierarchical generalized linear model27) to account
for the hierarchical structure in the data when accounting
for the dependency associated with twin pair status. Within
this modeling procedure we analyzed the logit function of
the probability of an event of diagnosis of dementia as a
conditional function of BMI, eight dummy-coded covariates
(that is, gender, smoking, alcohol habit, hypertension,
congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes
and stroke), two continuous covariates (age and education)
and a random effect of the intercept reflecting estimated
variability across the twin pairs. The random effect was
assumed to take a normal distribution with a mean of zero.
Risk of dementia was first analyzed for the total sample and
then separately for men and women. In the next step, we
examined if BMI was differentially related to AD and VaD:
this was first analyzed for the total sample, then separately
for men and women. Two models were run in each
case. Model I included age, gender, smoking and alcohol
habit as covariates. In Model II, diabetes and vascular
diseases (hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial
infarction and stroke) were added along with the covariates
included in Model I. The analyses were conducted using the
GLIMMIX procedure in SAS version 9.1.28 The statistical
analyses regarding the association between overweight and
dementia were based on one-tailed tests using the conven-
tional a level of 0.05.
Results
Sample characteristics
The sample characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were
statistically significant differences between the normal
weight group and the overweight group, such that the
overweight group had fewer years of education, comprised
more individuals who did not use alcohol, had more
individuals with hypertension, congestive heart failure and
diabetes (Po0.05).
Participant characteristics comparing controls with de-
mentia cases are presented in Table 2. There were statistically
significant differences between controls and cases, such that
the dementia group had more women, were older, had fewer
years of education, had shorter survival, comprised more
individuals who did not use alcohol, had more prevalent
congestive heart failure, stroke and APOE e4 carriers, and a
higher BMI (Po0.05).
Risk of dementia in relation to midlife BMI
The results from the logistic regression analyses that were all
corrected for twinship are presented in Table 3. Model I
(adjusted for demographics, smoking and alcohol use)
showed that midlife overweight was associated with greater
risk of dementia, such that those with a BMI above the third
quartile had a 59% greater risk of getting dementia in old age
as compared with those with lower BMI. Further adjust-
ments for diabetes and vascular diseases in Model II did not
substantially change this association. Among these covari-
ates, only stroke came out as a significant covariate
(OR ¼ 1.59).
When BMI was examined in relation to AD the same
pattern was found as with all dementia, although the
association was stronger in terms of risk, OR ¼ 1.71 in Model
I and OR ¼ 1.68 in the fully adjusted model. None of the
vascular risk factors were statistically significant. Concerning
VaD, the risk associated with higher BMI fell short out of
significance in Model I, (OR ¼ 1.55; P ¼ 0.059). However, the
risk was substantially reduced in Model II by including
diabetes and vascular diseases (OR ¼ 1.36; P ¼ 0.162), reflect-
ing the significance of these factors in the etiology of VaD. In
this model, congestive heart failure (OR ¼ 1.98) and stroke
(OR ¼ 6.97) were significantly related to risk of VaD
(Po0.05), whereas diabetes was marginally significant
(OR ¼ 1.65; P ¼ 0.067). The sex-stratified analyses on BMI
and dementia risk showed the same pattern among men and

women, therefore, these results will not be presented
separately.
A complementary analysis was conducted in which APOE
e4 carrier status was included in the analysis as a covariate as
well as the interaction term between BMI and APOE e4
status. As only 732 individuals had information regarding
APOE e4 status, we first analyzed BMI status in relation to all
dementia in the subsample of 732 individuals not including
APOE e4 status. This analysis resulted in an OR of 1.62 (95%
CI ¼ 1.17­2.24, P ¼ 0.008) for BMI status (as compared with
OR of 1.59 for N ¼ 1152). When APOE e4 status was included
as a covariate, the association between BMI status and
dementia was somewhat weaker, although still statistically
significant (OR ¼ 1.57, 95% CI ¼ 1.13­2.20, P ¼ 0.013). For
APOE e4 status the OR was 3.99 (95% CI ¼ 2.96­5.38,
Po0.001), confirming the well-established role of APOE e4
as a risk factor for dementia. The interaction between BMI
and APOE e4 was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.781),
indicating that having both risk factors does not have a
multiplicative effect on dementia risk but rather an additive
effect (see Table 4).
Discussion
This study examined if overweight in midlife is related to risk
of dementia in old age. Our results showed that midlife
overweight significantly increased the risk of dementia in
old age, even after controlling for known comorbid factors
related to vascular risk. Further, the risk was increased for
both AD and VaD. However, by controlling for diabetes and
vascular diseases the association between BMI and VaD was

reduced to a non-significant level. This was not the case for
AD. Finally, the sex-stratified analyses indicated the same
pattern for men and women.
There are few studies that have examined the long-term
risk of overweight in relation to dementia. This is reasonable
given the practical demands associated with studies requir-
ing extensive follow-up time. Consequently, studies to date
have often used medical records to gain data on dementia
diagnoses, a procedure that is unlikely to capture all cases
and include information on dementia subtypes. In our study,
the dementia diagnoses were made through a thorough
clinical procedure resulting in a highly confident outcome
diagnosis. On the other hand, the BMI measure is based on
self reports on weight and height, leaving a potential risk for
inaccuracy in the report. However, correlational analyses
conducted on SATSA,20 comparing self-reported and mea-
sured data on heights and weights, resulted in correlation of
0.97 for height and 0.95 for weight, supporting a notion of
valid and reliable self-reported data. There are other
measures of overweight that probably better reflect adiposity
than BMI, such as hip-to-waist ratio and circumference that
we unfortunately did not have in our data. Another issue
that needs to be highlighted when interpreting the results
from this study is the issue of potential survival bias.
Included in our study are people aged 45­65 years at baseline
and who were alive at the start of the aging studies (SATSA
and OCTO-Twin) on dementia. This implies that the
participants were at the age of 69 þ years (for the SATSA)
and 80 þ years (for the OCTO-Twin) at inclusion, meaning
that the results can only be generalized to people who
survive into that age. Another issue, related to the sample, is
that it is constituted of twins, which means that there is a
dependency within twin pairs. This was, however, dealt
within the statistical analyses by using multilevel models
that account for the dependency within pairs.
Generally, our results are in congruence with results from
studies where overweight is measured in midlife and the
follow-up time for the dementia outcome is extensive.2­4
When we analyzed the risk of dementia separately for the
sexes the same pattern was found for men and women, a
result that contradicts one study that reported greater risk for
women.14 Whitmer et al.3 found that the way adiposity is
measured results in different dementia risk for the sexes,
such that BMI predicted dementia only among women
whereas skinfold thickness was a significant predictor for
both sexes. Thus, there seems to be no substantial differences
between men and women in this matter.
Potential mechanisms by which overweight increases the
risk of compromised brain functioning in later life include
vascular disease, diabetes, genetics and inflammatory
processes. Overweight increases the risk of hypertension,
diabetes mellitus and stroke, all three known risk factors for
dementia. Our study, along with other studies show that
even after controlling for these comorbid risk factors,
overweight is still a significant risk factor of dementia. This
does not, however, rule out the possibility that these diseases
are of importance, especially given the fact that both
hypertension and diabetes-related conditions are under-
diagnosed and underreported in the general population.
APOE e4 carrier status is a known risk factor for vascular
disease and dementia.29,30 In our study, there were some-
what more APOE e4 carriers in the overweight group. In the
analysis in which APOE e4 status was included as a covariate,
overweight remained a significant independent predictor for
dementia. Most interestingly, however, was that overweight
did not interact with APOE e4 status on dementia risk in a
multiplicative manner, supporting earlier findings from the
Finnish CAIDE study.31 Another factor of importance is
inflammation that has been shown to be associated with
vascular disease,32 obesity,33,34 cognitive decline35 and
dementia.36 However, the direction of the associations
between inflammation and the above conditions is con-
troversial. In a recent study35 it was demonstrated that the
effects of the metabolic syndrome on cognitive decline were
mediated by inflammation, such that those with high
inflammation and the metabolic syndrome had a greater
risk of cognitive decline compared with those with low
inflammation but a metabolic syndrome.
To summarize, in congruence with the few studies that
have assessed overweight in midlife and risk of dementia in
later life, our study gives further support to the conclusion
that overweight is a significant risk factor for dementia.
