Children are often inextricably linked to their parents' hopes and dreams. As such, the
loss of a child often represents one of the most traumatic experiences possible. The
current research explores how this specific loss relates to one's sense of purpose in life.
We further explore whether the loss of a child is particularly detrimental to one's sense
of purpose for highly interdependent parents. Analyses of parents from the Midlife in the
United States data set revealed, as expected, that the loss of child negatively predicts
one's sense of purpose in life, and that this effect is most pronounced for parents high
in interdependent self-construal. Potential mechanisms and implications of the present
findings are discussed.
Keywords: parental bereavement, purpose in life, interdependent self-construal, well-being, adaptation
Introduction
People from diverse backgrounds commonly believe that children provide life with meaning and
fulfillment (Toulemon, 1996; Stanley et al., 2003). Corroborating these beliefs, a series of studies
recently demonstrated that parents experience more positive emotions, less negative emotions, and
greater life satisfaction and meaning in life through child-care activities compared to non-parents
(Ashton-James et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2013; see McLanahan and Adams, 1987; Blanchflower and
Oswald, 2004; Evenson and Simon, 2005; Kohler et al., 2005; White and Dolan, 2009, for supporting
and contradictory findings).
While children often imbue life with purpose and meaning, the loss of child can shake the
foundation of one's existence and detrimentally influence both physical and psychological health.
Research shows, for instance, bereaved parents suffer from a wide array of physical and mental
illness, including higher incidences of cancer (Li et al., 2002), increased mortality (Li et al., 2003),
more severe grief symptoms (Hazzard et al., 1992), post-traumatic stress disorder (Murphy et al.,
1999; Spooren et al., 2001), increased anger and hostility (Rando, 1983), shattered personal identity
and self-concepts (Neimeyer et al., 2002), and doubts in their world-views (Janoff-Bulman, 1989;
Matthews and Marwit, 2003).
Parental bereavement is posited to reduce one's sense of meaning and purpose in life
(Janoff-Bulman and Frantz, 1997). Indeed, a set of empirical data and qualitative investigations
demonstrate that bereaved parents often fail to find meaning in the loss experience for an extended
period of time after the loss of their child, and that these parents report higher mental distress
and lower physical health compared to those who successfully construct a sense of meaning in the
loss experience (Lehman et al., 1987; Braun and Berg, 1994; Murphy et al., 2003; Keesee et al., 2008;
Lichtenthal et al., 2013; see also Park, 2010 for a review). While prior research has focused primarily
on how situational meaning and a sense of purpose serve as coping resources following the loss of

a child, the present study directly examines how losing a child
influences parents' global purpose in life.
Researchers have defined purpose in life as a central, self-
organizing life aim that provides a person with a framework for
pursuing life goals (McKnight and Kashdan, 2009). Providing an
overarching sense of goals and direction in life, purpose in life has
been found to be positively associated with happiness and well-
being (Ryff, 1989; Byron and Miller-Perrin, 2009; Bronk et al.,
2009; Burrow and Hill, 2011). More recently, Hill and Turiano
(2014) demonstrated that purpose in life serves to buffer against
mortality risk across adulthood using data from the Midlife in
United States (MIDUS) sample (see also Boyle et al., 2009). The
present research aims to explore the possibility that experiencing
the loss of a child may violate parents' overarching goals and
fundamental beliefs about life, and thus reducing their sense of
purpose.
A secondary goal of the current research is to explore an
unexamined psychological factor that may moderate the effect
of loss of child on purpose in life (e.g., Lehman et al., 1987;
McIntosh et al., 1993). In the present study, we suggest that
individual differences in interdependent self-construal play a
pivotal role in the extent to which bereaved parents find it
difficult to extract purpose in life from the loss experience. People
who hold interdependent self-construals value harmony in social
relationships and place close others in the core part of their self-
concept, whereas those who hold independent self-construals
value autonomy and maintain uniqueness by distancing others
from their self-concept (Markus and Kitayama, 1991; Singelis,
1994). The closeness between self and significant others among
those high in interdependent self-construal is particularly salient
between caregivers and children. For example, among Eastern
Asians (i.e., interdependent people), one's self is predominantly
described in terms of their caregivers (Markus and Kitayama,
1991; Bochner, 1994) and, for these people, neural activity that
processes self-relevant information does not distinguish between
stimuli related to one's self and one's mother, for example (Zhu
et al., 2007; Chiao et al., 2009). Likewise, children are a central
part of the self-concept of parents who possess interdependent
self-construals.
Based on the relevant literature on parental bereavement and
cultural psychology, we hypothesize that (A) losing a child will
detract from one's overall sense of purpose in life and (B) this
relationship will be stronger for parents high in interdependent
self-construal than for those low in interdependent self-construal.
To test this hypothesis, we employed a longitudinal data
set that includes American adult respondents. Specifically,
we used the same data set MIDUS that Hill and Turiano
(2014) analyzed to demonstrate that purpose in life predicts
decreased mortality rates. Although investigations of self-
construal are often conducted in a cross-cultural manner (e.g.,
East vs. West), there is also great variability in self-construal
within cultures (Oyserman et al., 2002). The current research
focuses on how individual differences in self-construal, rather
than cultural differences, moderate the relationship between
the loss of a child and purpose in life. From both cross-
sectional and longitudinal analyses of the data, we expect
that decreased purpose in life by the loss of a child would
be more pronounced for parents high in interdependent self-
construal compared to their low interdependent self-construal
counterparts.
Materials and Methods
Participants
We used two waves of the data sets from MIDUS to test
our hypotheses. This data set is composed of a nationally
representative group of individuals aimed at examining age-
related differences in physical and mental health. An initial
survey was conducted in 1995­1996 (Wave 1) and recruited
a sample of 7,108 non-institutionalized adults from the 48
contiguous states via random-digit dialing of telephone numbers.
In a follow-up survey conducted in 2004­2006 (Wave 2), seventy
percent of the initial sample participated again. The final sample
of 4,963 respondents (females = 2,647, males = 2,316), who
participated both in Wave 1 and 2 surveys, was entered in the
current analyses. The ages of these participants ranged from
20 to 75 years at Wave 1 (M = 46.46 years, SD = 12.51)
and ranged from 28 to 84 years at Wave 2 (M = 55.43 years,
SD = 12.45).
Measures
Self-Construal
Participants completed the Self-Construal scale, which consists
of interdependent self-construal and independent self-construal
subscales (Singelis, 1994). Interdependent and independent self-
construal was assessed only at Wave 2. Each scale contained
three items ("My happiness depends on the happiness of those
around me," "I often have the feeling that my relationships
with others are more important than my own accomplishments,"
and "It is important to listen to other's opinions" for the
interdependent self-construal subscale; "I act in the same way
no matter who I am with," "I enjoy being unique and different
from others in many respects," and "Being able to take care
of myself is a primary concern for me" for the independent
self-construal subscale). Participants rated the extent of their
agreement with each item on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly
disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Average scores of the items
in each scale were computed to form separate composites

for the interdependent and independent self-construal scales
(Minter
= 4.72, SD = 1.13; Mindep
= 5.25, SD = 1.07). Consistent
with the previous literature, the two self-construal subscales were
not correlated (r = 0.01, p = 0.51).
Loss of Child
The experience of losing a child was assessed in two ways. First,
participants reported whether they have ever experienced a loss of
a child. This self-report was only measured in the Wave 2 survey.
There were 2,394 respondents who provided this information,
and 14.2% of them (339) reported that they lost at least one
child in their lifetime. While this measure is the most face valid
measure of loss in the data set, it did not allow us to control
for when the loss might have occurred (e.g., 30 years vs. 1 year
ago). To help control for this concern, for our second measure
of loss, we subtracted the number of children at Wave 2 from
the number of children at Wave 1, and defined those having
a negative number for this difference score as parents who
had experienced child loss. There were 4,064 respondents who
provided the number of children both at Wave 1 and 2, and 7.3%
of these participants (364) had fewer children at Wave 2 than
Wave 1.
Purpose in Life
Purpose in life was measured by using the purpose in life
subscale of Psychological Well-Being scale (PWB; Ryff, 1989).
The subscale consisted of three items ["I live life 1 day at a
time and don't really think about the future (reversed)," "Some
people wander aimlessly through life, but I am not one of them,"
and "I sometimes feel as if I've done all there is to do in life
(reversed);" at Wave 1, at Wave 2], which were rated on a 7-
point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). A sum of
the items was calculated and used as an indicator of purpose in
life (M = 16.73, SD = 3.50 at Wave 1; M = 16.21, SD = 3.42 at
Wave 2).
Covariates
Age, gender, level of education, income, number of children
(alive), and Big Five personality from the Wave 2 data were
used as covariates in our analyses. The level of education
was measured by asking the highest grade of school or
year of college participants completed using a 12-point scale
(1 = no school or some grade school, 7 = 3 or more
years of college, no degree yet, 12 = Ph.D., MD, or other
professional degree; M = 7.20, SD = 2.52). The personal
annual income was assessed on a 42-point scale (1 = less than
$0/loss, 42 = $200,000 or more). The median income was 14
($22,500­$24,499). The average number of children was 2.50
(SD = 1.76).
Results
Cross-sectional Analyses
We first conducted a hierarchical linear regression analysis
using the self-reported loss of a child variable in a cross-
sectional manner to test our hypothesis. The main effects of
interdependent self-construal (centered) and the self-report item
assessing losing a child (effect coded; -1 = no loss, 1 = loss
of child) were entered in Step 1, and their interaction term was
entered in Step 2. As presented in Table 1, we found that both
the loss of a child (b = -0.31, p = 0.002) and interdependent
self-construal (b = -0.17, p = 0.007) negatively predicted
purpose in life. Importantly, however, the interaction effect was
significant (b = -0.22, p = 0.01). As shown in Figure 1A,
the experience of losing a child predicted less purpose in life
for people high in interdependent self-construal (b = -0.56,
p < 0.001), whereas losing a child was unrelated to purpose in
life for those low in interdependent self-construal (b = -0.07,
p = 0.60). This interaction pattern remained consistent even
when relevant covariates (i.e., age, gender, education level,
income, number of children, Big Five) were accounted for (see
Table 2).
Next, we ran the same hierarchical linear regression analysis,
substituting independent self-construal for interdependent self-
construal, that is, entering the main effect terms of independent
self-construal (centered) and the self-report of losing child
(effect coded) in Step 1, and their interaction term in

Using the change in number of child between Wave 1 and

tested our hypothesis again in a longitudinal manner. We ran
a similar hierarchical linear regression analysis by entering
purpose in life at Wave 1 (centered) in Step 1, as a covariate,
the change in number of child (effect coded; -1 = no
loss, 1 = loss of child) in Step 2, and its interaction with
interdependent self-construal in Step 3 as predictors of purpose
in life at Wave 2. As presented in Table 3, we found that

purpose at Wave 1 (Step 1), losing a child, and interdependent
self-construal (Step 2) each significantly predicted purpose in
life at Wave 2 (b = 0.43, p < 0.001; b = -0.27, p = 0.004;
b = -0.14, p = 0.003, respectively). As predicted, however,
these main effects were qualified by a significant interaction
effect (b = -0.22, p = 0.008). The pattern was consistent with
the cross-sectional findings (see Figure 1B). Simple slope tests
revealed that the experience of losing child predicted lowered
purpose in life for parents high in interdependent self-construal
(b = -0.51, p < 0.001), whereas the same experience was
not related to purpose in life for those low in interdependent
self-construal (b = -0.03, p = 0.83). Results were unchanged
when other relevant covariates were included in the analysis (see
Table 2).
We performed the same analyses, substituting independent
self-construal for interdependent self-construal. The main effects
of purpose in life at Wave 1, losing a child, and independent
self-construal were significant predictors of purpose in life at
Wave 2 (b = 0.43, p < 0.001; b = -0.29, p = 0.003; b = 0.11,
p = 0.022, respectively). However, the interaction term failed to
predict purpose in life (b = -0.04, p = 0.65).
Additional Analyses
We also conducted the additional analyses to examine how
interdependent self-construal and parental bereavement predict
other well-being variables (i.e., subjective well-being and
depression) that were available in MIDUS. The results of these
analyses did not reveal consistent patterns, indicating that
the interactive effect between interdependent self-construal and
parental bereavement existed only with regard to purpose in
life (see Supplementary Material for tables depicting these null
effects).

Discussion
These findings support our hypothesis that loss of a child erodes
one's sense of purpose in life and that this impact is particularly
pronounced for those with an interdependent self-construal. In
both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we found that
experiencing loss of a child significantly lowered purpose in life
among highly interdependent parents, whereas bereavement did
not affect purpose in life among parents low in interdependent
self-construal. In both analyses, independent self-construal did
not moderate the effect of loss of children on purpose in life.
These findings are consistent with extant research on hedonic
adaptation demonstrating that important individual differences
may bear on the restoration of psychological equanimity after
the experience of a negative life event (e.g., Lucas et al., 2003;
Luhmann et al., 2012).
Although our results found that purpose in life among parents
low in interdependent self-construal did not seem to be affected
by a loss of a child, we do not suggest that these people are
immune to negative responses from these types of traumatic
events. Rather, we believe that this indicates that they may
be better at "bouncing back" from the trauma than highly
interdependent parents. They may, for example, have better
coping strategies that help them reconstruct purpose in life
(e.g., they may find it easier to focus on other domains in life
such as work). Of course, it is also possible that the initial
experience of bereavement is stronger for highly interdependent
individuals (cf., Lucas et al., 2003). The adaptation process
might be homogenous for all parents but, because of this initial
difference, those with interdependent self-construal may take
much longer to regain their sense of purpose. Future research
needs to explore the mechanisms underlying the different levels
of purpose in life between bereaved parents high and low in
interdependent self-construal.
Interestingly, independent self-construal did not affect
purpose in life among bereaved parents. This finding suggests
that experiencing parental bereavement life events is uniquely
associated with interdependent self-construal rather than
independent self-construal, which is consistent with prior
research demonstrating that the dimensions of independent
and interdependent self-construals are orthogonal and thus can
coexist in individuals (e.g., Singelis, 1994). However, it is possible
that other types of personal loss, that have more individualistic
implications (e.g., losing one's eyesight), might relate to purpose
in life more strongly for people high in independent self-
construal. Future research should investigate whether the various
types of personal loss uniquely interact with independent and
interdependent self-construal to predict a sense of purpose.
Hedonic well-being is described as a subjective state of feeling
pleasure and satisfied with one's life, whereas eudaimonic well-
being is defined as a state of human flourishing that is achieved
from pursuing goals expressing one's true self and giving purpose
and meaning to his life (Ryan and Deci, 2001). These two aspects
of well-being often operate in tandem (e.g., King et al., 2006) but
are also theoretically and empirically distinct (e.g., Baumeister
et al., 2013). Previous literatures on adaptation following critical
life events primarily focus on changes in hedonic aspects of
happiness (i.e., subjective well-being; Lucas et al., 2003; Luhmann
et al., 2012). However, eudaimonic aspects of happiness are
also influenced by various life events (Waterman, 2007; Durkin
and Joseph, 2009; Uchida et al., 2014). Our research highlights
purpose in life as one particular dimension of eudaimonic well-
being that is affected by the loss of a child. Future research should
examine how self-construal and specific types of trauma uniquely
detract from hedonic and eudaimonic sources of happiness.
The current findings have implications for cultural psychology
by showing that the impact of parental bereavement on purpose
in life is more pronounced for interdependent people than
independent people. An obvious limitation is that we only
compared interdependent and independent people within the
same culture. Future research should examine whether the same
pattern of results emerges in direct cross-cultural comparisons.
For example, is it possible that the loss of a child is more traumatic
for people from Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures?
Or, perhaps people from Eastern cultures have other types of
coping mechanisms that help them regain a sense of purpose
following the loss of a child? These possibilities remain to be
addressed by future research.
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate that the loss of a child threatens
parents' sense of purpose and that it may be particularly difficult
for highly interdependent parents to rediscover meaningful goal
pursuits after such tragedy. It is our hope that future research will
uncover the underlying mechanisms driving this effect and the
variables that help highly interdependent people cope with the
loss of a child.
