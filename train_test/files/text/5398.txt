The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act of 2004
(IDEA) establishes that all children identified as eligible to
receive special education services are entitled to receive a
free appropriate public education in the least restrictive envi-
ronment (IDEA, 2004a,). As part of the process for ensuring
that children with disabilities receive this level of educa-
tional service, IDEA outlines both procedural and substan-
tive requirements that must be met by school districts
(Drasgow, Yell, & Robinson, 2001). Procedural requirements
include processes such as including parents in decision-mak-
ing processes and adhering to timelines for evaluation and
program development. Substantive requirements address
issues of quality and appropriateness, including the content
of each eligible child's Individualized Education Program
(IEP), the types of special education and related services pro-
vided, and the selection of the educational environment(s) at
which services are provided.
Research has demonstrated that school districts often
struggle to meet the procedural and substantive requirements
of special education law (Drasgow et al., 2001), including
the provision that stipulates that parents should be included
as participants in the educational decision-making process
(Fish, 2008; Garriott, Wandry, & Snyder, 2000; Lo, 2008;
Salas, 2004; Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Javitz, & Valdes,
2012; Zeitlin & Curcic, 2014). In instances in which con-
flicts arise between parents and school personnel regarding
the development of IEPs or the implementation of education
services, IDEA (2004) outlines a process for dispute resolu-
tion. There are three formal procedures for resolving special
education disputes: mediation, resolution meetings, and due
process hearings. Mediation is the least adversarial and most
pro-active of these options (Mueller, 2009; Zirkel &
McGuire, 2010). In mediation, both sides utilize an impartial
mediator to resolve their differences and reach a mutually
acceptable agreement. Mediation is a voluntary process, and
any agreements resulting from this process are developed
through cooperation and compromise between the parties.
The other two formal resolution procedures identified in
IDEA are resolution meetings and due process hearings.
Resolution meetings are a relatively recent addition, having
been included in IDEA during the 2004 reauthorization in an

A Longitudinal Study of Special Education
Due Process Hearings in Massachusetts:
Issues, Representation, and Student
Characteristics
William H. Blackwell1 and Vivian V. Blackwell2
Abstract
Of the three formal dispute resolution procedures provided by the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act of 2004(IDEA),
due process hearings are the most costly in terms of time, fiscal resources, and impact on relationships between school
personnel and parents. This study examined 258 due process hearings held over the past 8 years in Massachusetts to
examine the characteristics of students at the center of these disputes, the issues that were addressed in the hearings, and
the representation utilized by parents and school districts. The findings from this study indicated that (a) Massachusetts
school districts utilized attorney representation and won due process hearings at notably higher levels than parents, and (b)
the most frequently addressed issues at due process hearings were Individualized Education Program (IEP) development/
implementation and educational program placement, which are issues that represent the core mandate of IDEA to provide
a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment (34 C.F.R. §300.300, 300.550). The authors present
recommendations for policy actions and areas for future research.

attempt to introduce less adversarial mechanisms for dispute
resolution (Mueller, 2009). Resolution meetings are manda-
tory if a parent has filed for due process and any agreements
reached are binding (IDEA, 2004b). If the resolution meeting
is not successful in solving the existing dispute, then the third
formal resolution procedure outlined in IDEA is enacted.
Due process hearings include all of the formal elements of
dispute resolution, including review of evidence, written
and/or oral testimony, and the frequent use of attorney repre-
sentation (Mueller, 2009; Zirkel & McGuire, 2010). The
final judgment comes from a hearing officer, and the results
are legally binding.
Of the three formal dispute resolution procedures pro-
vided by IDEA (2004), due process hearings are the most
costly in terms of time, fiscal resources, and impact on rela-
tionships between school personnel and parents (Cope-
Kasten, 2013; Mueller, 2009). The financial costs may run as
high as US$50,000 per hearing, with an average cost running
between US$8,000 and US$12,000 (Daggett, 2004; Mueller,
2009). Despite these considerable costs, the number of due
process hearings across the nation rose steadily in the 1990s
(Ahearn, 2002; General Accounting Office, 2003) and has
remained at a high level of over 2,000 hearings annually dur-
ing the 2000s (Zirkel & Gischlar, 2008; Zirkel & Scala,
2010). The number of hearings is not evenly distributed
across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In the most
recent state-by-state analysis, Zirkel and Scala (2010) found
that nine states and the District of Columbia accounted for
91% of the total due process hearings held during 2008
through 2009. The nine states were New York, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Hawaii, Texas,
Massachusetts, and Illinois.
Given the high volume of due process hearings, their sig-
nificant financial costs, and the negative impact on parent­
school relationships, it is important to further examine the
existing research on this IDEA dispute resolution procedure.
Over the past 15 years, research on due process hearings has
addressed the disability characteristics of children at the cen-
ter of the disputes, the issues addressed during the hearings,
the prevailing parties, and the extent to which legal and lay
representation was utilized by the disputing parties. Regarding
the characteristics of children involved in due process hear-
ings, Mueller and Carranza (2011) reported that students with
specific learning disabilities and students with autism spec-
trum disorders were at issue in just under half of 575 due pro-
cess hearings held in 41 states. Students categorized as having
other health impairments, emotional disturbance, or intellec-
tual disabilities were the next most frequently occurring
groups in the hearings. This finding was consistent with a pre-
vious study (Newcomer & Zirkel, 1999) that identified stu-
dents with learning disabilities as the largest disability group
represented in due process hearings. The Newcomer and
Zirkel (1999) study had an unexpected finding in that stu-
dents with multiple disabilities were involved in 17% of the
hearings in their sample, as compared with these students
representing only 1.9% of the overall population of students
receiving special education services. This finding was not
supported by the Mueller and Carranza (2011) study.
Previous research on special education due process hear-
ings has consistently found that the most frequent issues at
dispute involve educational placement, IEPs, assessment/
evaluation, and service delivery (Cope-Kasten, 2013;
Mueller & Carranza, 2011; Newcomer & Zirkel, 1999;
Rickey, 2003). In a 41-state sample, Mueller and Carranza
(2011) reported that placement (25%) and IEP(24%) together
represented almost half of the due process hearings exam-
ined. Cope-Kasten (2013) analyzed 210 due process hearings
from Minnesota and Wisconsin over a 12-year period, and
similarly found that IEP (47%) and placement (35%) were
frequently occurring issues. The author also reported that
service provision (42%) and evaluation (38%) were common
issues addressed in due process. Rickey (2003) examined 50
due process hearings in Iowa over a 12-year period. The
most frequently occurring issues were placement (46%) and
evaluation (30%).
Research that has examined the prevailing parties in due
process hearings has yielded inconsistent results. Two earlier
studies (McKinney & Schultz, 1996; Sultana, 1997) indi-
cated that parents prevailed on a majority of issues addressed
at hearings. However, subsequent research (Cope-Kasten,
2013; Mueller & Carranza, 2011; Newcomer & Zirkel, 1999;
Rickey, 2003) has demonstrated that school districts prevail
on the largest portion of issues in due process hearings.
Furthermore, Cope-Kasten (2013) examined the parties'suc-
cesses by type of representation. The author found that in
cases where parents did not have attorney representation,
school districts prevailed in 98% of the hearings. When par-
ents did have attorney representation, school districts pre-
vailed in 64% of the hearings. In an earlier study on
representation, Kuriloff and Goldberg (1997) reported that
parents perceived that they had more relative power in the
dispute than parents who used a lay advocate or represented
themselves. Ahearn (2002) found that many states did not
collect on data on representation at due process hearings, and
that those that did collect data reported that there were issues
with securing affordable attorneys for parents.
Purpose and Research Questions
Given the continued high volume of due process hearings
conducted annually in the United States and the relatively
limited amount of research conducted in this area (Reiman
et al., 2007), additional research on due process hearings can
potentially benefit a wide range of stakeholders. These stake-
holders include children with disabilities, their parents, edu-
cators, advocates, attorneys, researchers, and policy makers.
Particularly with another reauthorization of IDEA on the
horizon, continued research in this area is timely and impor-
tant. The authors wanted to build on the previous research by
conducting a longitudinal study of due process hearings
Blackwell and Blackwell 3
within a state that continues to have consistently high vol-
umes of hearings each year. It was hoped that by engaging in
an in-depth study of due process hearings within a state that
consistently has a high number of due process hearings,
information can be uncovered that would shed light on
potential ways to effectively resolve conflicts sooner and at a
lower fiscal and relationship cost than occurs during due pro-
cess hearings.
After consulting the existing research on the number of
due process hearings held in each state (Zirkel & Gischlar,
2008; Zirkel & Scala, 2010), the authors selected
Massachusetts as the target state. Massachusetts ranked in
the top 10 states nationally in the number of hearings held
annually and ranked 12th nationally in the number of hear-
ings held per capita (Zirkel & Gischlar, 2008). The authors
also had a more personal reason for selecting Massachusetts
as the focus of this study. Both authors had previously
worked in special education service provision and disability
advocacy in Massachusetts at the local and state levels.
Although the authors no longer work within the state, there
remains a vested interest in trying to uncover information
that may lead to more collaborative dispute resolution, as
well as improved procedures and services for students that
can prevent disputes from arising in the first place. Having
worked in multiple states, the authors felt that the results
from a study on due process hearings in Massachusetts could
also inform and benefit stakeholders in other jurisdictions.
With the considerable costs of special education litiga-
tion (Daggett, 2004) and the findings from previous research
that indicated school districts win a notable majority of due
process hearings (Cope-Kasten, 2013; Lupini & Zirkel,
2003; Newcomer & Zirkel, 1999; Rickey, 2003), the authors
felt it was important to examine the extent to which parents
obtain legal and lay representation, and to determine if there
were any patterns in the frequency of use of representation
over time. The authors were also interested in examining a
high volume of due process hearings over a number of years
to determine if there were any trends in the types of issues
that were brought to due process hearings and the character-
istics of students who were the subject of these hearings.
The following research questions were developed to guide
the study:
·
· Student characteristics: What were the characteristics
of students who were the focus of due process hear-
ings, including disability categories, grade levels, and
educational placements? Were there trends in these
characteristics over time?
·
· Issues: What were the issues addressed in due process
hearings? Were there trends in these issues over time?
How often did parents and school districts prevail on
each of these issues?
·
· Representation: How often do parents and school
districts utilize legal and lay representation at due
process hearings? Were there trends in types of
representation over time? How often did parents and
school districts with different types of representation
prevail in due process hearings?
Method
Data Source
The data set for this study was all written due process hearing
decisions issued by the Massachusetts Bureau of Special
Education Appeals (BSEA; n.d.) from July 1, 2005 through
June 30, 2013. The authors felt that selecting a starting point
of July 1, 2005 provided data that would primarily include
disputes arising since the most recent reauthorization of
IDEA in 2004. Data collection was straightforward as all
hearing decisions in Massachusetts are available to the pub-
lic via the BSEA's website. Each written decision file was
downloaded and an Excel database was created to manage
data entry, coding, and analysis. A total of 258 hearing deci-
sions were identified and included in the analysis. There
were an additional 23 hearing decisions that were excluded
from the study because they only addressed disputes between
school districts related to financial responsibility for stu-
dents' special education programs.
Coding and Analysis
After identifying the 258 due process hearing decisions,
each hearing file was logged in the project database. The
information logged for each case included the case number,
fiscal year (based on a July 1 to June 30 schedule), hearing
officer who issued the decision, and the school district name.
Each written hearing decision was then read and coded. The
initial code set was informed by previous published research
on due process hearings and judicial outcomes (Cope-
Kasten, 2013; Mueller & Carranza, 2011; Newcomer &
Zirkel, 1999; Rickey, 2003) as well as on the authors' prior
knowledge and experience with special education dispute
resolution. The initial definitions for the codes were refined
and additional codes were identified during the establish-
ment of intercoder reliability and during ongoing conversa-
tions between the two principal investigators. The final code
set was as follows:
1. Legal representation--The type of representation
used by each party (attorney, pro se with advocate/
consultant support, pro se).
2. School level--School level of the student at question
in the dispute at the time of the due process hearing
(preschool, elementary, middle school, high school,
post­high school).
3. Primary disability category--Primary disability of the
student as stated in the written hearing decision. In
cases in which the student presented with multiple dis-
abilities, the code "multiple" was used. For purposes
4 SAGE Open
of this study, the terminology for the disability catego-
ries used was taken from the Massachusetts special
education regulations.
4. Educational program placement--The educational
environment for the student at the time of the hearing
request.
5. Prevailing party--The prevailing party for each issue
(district, parent, mixed).An example of a mixed deci-
sion was a due process hearing in which related ser-
vices were an issue. In this instance, the parent won
the portion of the issue focused on physical therapy
services, and the school district won the portion of
the issue focused on occupational therapy services.
6. Issues--The identified issue(s) in dispute. Each sepa-
rate issue addressed within a due process hearing was
coded. The subcodes for issues were as follows.
a. Evaluation--Evaluation process and proce-
dures for determining areas of need and poten-
tial services, including independent education
evaluations and the selection/qualifications of
evaluators.
b. Extended school year services--Special educa-
tion and related services provided to eligible stu-
dents beyond the typical 10-month academic year.
c. Identification--Eligibility determination for
special education services.
d. IEP--Components and development of the IEP,
commonly examined to determine the extent to
which the IEP was calculated to provide a free
appropriate public education in the least restric-
tive environment.
e. Placement--Location of special education ser-
vices for a student, including services provided
in general education settings and specialized set-
tings that will provide the student access to the
general education environment to the appropri-
ate extent; includes unilateral placement of stu-
dent by parent.
f. Procedural safeguards--Procedural protec-
tions afforded to students, parents, and schools
through federal and state special education laws
and regulations; included timelines, parental
consent, and written notices.
g. Related services--Developmental, rehabilita-
tive, corrective, and supportive services that are
necessary to assist a student in accessing and
benefiting from special and general education
services; included specialized transportation,
occupational therapy, physical therapy, and ori-
entation and mobility services.
h. Suspension/expulsion--Removal of a student
from the agreed-upon placement due to disci-
plinary actions; included both in-school and out-
of-school suspensions.
i. Transition--Practices and procedures related
to transition planning for secondary students to
assist in developing the knowledge, skills, and
strategies for accessing and benefiting from
post-secondary opportunities such a college,
employment, independent living, and commu-
nity participation.
There were a limited number of instances in which a vari-
able could not be assigned a code because the information
was not provided in the written decision. For these instances,
the data was recorded as "not indicated."
The two authors were equally responsible for all of the
data collection, coding, and analysis. To refine codes and to
establish intercoder reliability, an initial set of 20 hearings
was randomly selected and coded by both authors. After
meeting to compare codes and refine the code book, the
authors then re-coded these 20 hearing decisions plus an
additional 32 hearing decisions (for a total of 20% of the
sample). Intercoder reliability was calculated based on these
52 hearing decisions using a formula recommended by Miles
and Huberman (1994): Reliability = (Number of agreements) /
(Total number of agreements plus disagreements). The final
intercoder reliability calculation was 98.1%. Throughout the
entire coding and analysis process, the authors frequently
discussed any questions regarding codes and often examined
portions of hearings together to ensure that an agreed-upon
code was assigned. All data were recorded in a master data-
base to better facilitate analysis and reporting. As the pur-
pose of this study was to present and describe population
data from due process hearings over time, descriptive statis-
tics were deemed most appropriate for the analyses (Vogt,
2006).
Findings
Characteristics of Students in Due Process
Hearings
The 258 special education due process hearings were ana-
lyzed to determine the characteristics of students at the cen-
ter of these disputes, including their primary disability
categories, grade levels, and educational program place-
ments at the time of the hearing request. These data are pre-
sented in Table 1.
Over the 8-year period of this study, the most common
disability categories were multiple disabilities (29.1%), fol-
lowed by specific learning disabilities (23.6%), autism
(14.3%), and emotional/behavioral impairment (14.0%). All
other disability categories were present in less than 50% of
the hearings. Regarding trends in disability categories over
time, there were three notable items. The percentage of stu-
dents with multiple disabilities were markedly higher from
fiscal year (FY)10 to FY13 than in earlier years, with per-
centages of 35.9% in FY10, 34.4% in FY11, 44.1% in FY12,
Blackwell and Blackwell 5
and 55.6% in FY13. The percentage of students with specific
learning disabilities declined steadily from FY07 to FY13.
The percentage was 44.7% in FY07, and then moved to
24.3% in FY09, 15.6% in FY11, and finally 3.7% in FY13.
The third notable item was the decline in the percentage of
students with emotional/behavioral impairments in due pro-
cess hearings. The percentage was 28.0% in FY06, moved to
19.9% in FY09, and was 3.7% in FY13.
The grade levels of students at the center of due process
hearings were relatively evenly distributed. There were
27.1% of students at the preschool/elementary level, 29.1%
at the middle school level, 36.0% at the high school level,
and 5.4% at the post­high school level (e.g., students ages
19-21 in transition programs). Trend analysis indicated that
students at the post­high school grade levels were repre-
sented in due process hearings at a high point of 13.5% (5
hearings) in FY09, and then have declined to being involved
in no hearings in either FY12 or FY13. No other potential
trends were identified in these data.
The students' educational program placements at the time
of the hearing request were also examined. The most fre-
quent placements were general education classrooms with
inclusive and/or resource room support services (44.2%),
followed by separate public or private day schools (18.6%),
substantially separate special education classrooms within
the public school (17.4%), and residential/hospital programs
(11.6%). Longitudinal analyses indicated a potential trend in
the type of educational program placement for students
involved in due process hearings. From FY11 to FY13, there
were declines in the percentages of students placed in gen-
eral education classrooms with inclusive/resource supports
(43.8% in FY11 to 22.2% in FY13) and in the percentages of
students placed in substantially separate classrooms with
public schools (21.9% in FY11 to 11.1% in FY13). Over this

same period, there was an increase in the percentages of stu-
dents placed in public/private day schools (18.8% in FY11 to
29.6% in FY13) and residential/hospital programs (6.3% in
FY11 to 22.2% in FY13). Further analysis indicated that stu-
dents had been unilaterally placed by the parents into either a
separate public/private day school or a residential/hospital
program in 11 out of the 38 disputes involving students in
these placements from FY11 to FY13.
Issues Addressed in Due Process Hearings
There were a total of 496 issues addressed in the 258 due
process hearings held from FY06 through FY13, which
resulted in an average of almost 2 issues per hearing. There
were 89 hearings that addressed 1 issue, 114 hearings that
addressed 2 issues, and 55 hearings that addressed 3 or more
issues. The number of issues addressed annually peaked in
2007 (83 issues), and showed a steady decrease in recent
years (75 issues in FY10, 60 issues in FY11, 56 issues in
FY12, and 49 issues in FY13). The data on issues addressed
in due process hearings is presented in Table 2.
The most frequently addressed issues in due process hear-
ings were related to the development and content of IEPs
(34.3% of all issues) and student placement (30.4%). These
two areas were the most common issues in each of the 8
years examined. IEP and student placement were also fre-
quently addressed in the same hearings. The two were identi-
fied as issues in 119 out of 258 due process hearings (46.1%).
The next most frequently addressed issues were procedural
safeguards (10.3%), evaluation (8.5%), and related services
(7.7%). There were no trends in these areas over the 8 years,
but it should be noted that evaluation had a 1-year spike in
FY10 (16.0% of all issues that year). The issues of identifica-
tion, extended school year services, suspension/expulsion,
and transition were all under 3.0% of the total issues
addressed. The only change over time in these areas was with
extended school year services. Since FY10, only 1 due pro-
cess hearing has addressed this area as an issue. Of the 9
transition-related issues, 5 of these were presented in hear-
ings during FY09. No other year had more than one transi-
tion issue addressed at a due process hearing.
The due process hearings were also examined to deter-
mine the prevailing parties on each issue. While one of either
the school district or parent typically prevailed on an issue,
there were some instances in which the hearing officer pre-
sented a mixed decision in which both parties prevailed on
various aspects of the same issue. The data on prevailing par-
ties were analyzed in the aggregate for the 8-year period of
this study, as the majority of the issue cells had n-sizes that
were too small to be usefully examined by individual fiscal
year. Table 3 presents the data on prevailing party by issue.
Overall, school districts prevailed on 62.5% of all issues,
parents prevailed on 27.2% of issues, and a mixed decision
was issued on 10.3% of the issues. When examined by issue,
the range of issues on which school districts prevailed
extended from 50.0% of issues involving suspension/expul-
sion to 71.4% of issues involving evaluation. The percentage
of issues in which parents prevailed ranged from 14.3% of
issues involving evaluation to 50.0% of issues involving sus-
pension/expulsion. Besides evaluation and suspension/
expulsion, there were no issues in which it appeared one
party prevailed out of proportion to the overall rate of suc-
cess on all issues combined. The issue of placement was fur-
ther examined to determine the outcomes of these issues
when parents had unilaterally placed the student prior to the
due process hearing. In the 48 hearings in which this situa-
tion was evident, districts prevailed on 27 issues related to
unilateral placement by the parent (56.3%), parents prevailed
on 15 issues (31.2%), and a mixed decision was presented on
6 unilateral placement issues (12.5%). These percentages
were consistent with the overall success rate of these parties
on other issues related to placement.

Representation of Parties in Due Process
Hearings
Each of the 258 due process hearings were examined to
determine how often parents and school districts utilized
legal and lay representation. In all 258 hearings (100%) from
FY06 to FY13, school districts utilized attorney representa-
tion. Over this same time period, parents had attorney repre-
sentation in 40.3% of due process hearings, represented
themselves pro se in 103 hearings (39.9%) and utilized advo-
cate support in an additional 39 hearings (15.1%). In 12 hear-
ings (4.7%), parents did not participate. Table 4 presents data
on parent representation at due process hearings.
Regarding trend analysis, parents utilized attorney repre-
sentation more frequently from FY06 to FY08 (44.0%,
57.9%, and 42.3%, respectively, in those years). Beginning
with FY09, parents did not enlist attorney representation
more than 40.6% (FY11) in any given year. The two lowest
years for parent use of attorney representation were in FY13
(29.6%) and in FY09 (32.4%). In every fiscal year beginning
with FY08, parents represented themselves pro se with or
without advocate support in over 50.0% of the due process
hearings. In the final 2 years of this study, parents were pro
se with or without advocate support in 61.8% (FY12) and
66.7% (FY 12) of due process hearings.
The due process hearings were also analyzed to determine
how often the parties won with different types of representa-
tion. As the n-sizes for parent representation cells were small
in most years, these data were analyzed in the aggregate of
the 8 years of the study. For purposes of this analysis, a party
was deemed to have won a due process hearing if that party
prevailed on all issues. If both parties prevailed on separate
issues within a hearing, then the outcome was coded as
"mixed." The data on prevailing party by type of representa-
tion is presented in Table 5.
School districts had attorney representation in all 258 due
process hearings, and won 55.0% of these hearings. School
districts lost 20.5% of the hearings and had a mixed decision
in 24.4%. Parents had lower success rates, regardless of rep-
resentation type. Parents with attorney representation won
30.8% of hearings, lost 39.4%, and had mixed decisions in
29.8%. Parents who represented themselves pro se without
advocate support won 10.7% of the hearings, lost 68.9%, and
had mixed decisions in 20.4%. Parents who were pro se with
advocate support fared better, winning 20.5% of the hear-
ings, losing 51.3%, and having mixed decisions in 28.2%.

Discussion
Limitations
Before engaging in a discussion of the findings, it is impor-
tant to recognize the limitations to this study. First, this study
was restricted to one state, Massachusetts. Although the
authors believe that the findings from this study can inform
and benefit stakeholders in other states, the fact remains that
this research is embedded within the context of a single state
jurisdiction. Another limitation relates to inconsistencies in
the level of detail provided in the written hearing decisions
over the 8 years of this study. A total of 10 hearing officers
issued written hearing decisions, and each officer utilized a
slightly different format and sometimes marked differences
in the level of descriptiveness. In other instances, the same
hearing officer provided a high level of detail in one hearing
but a lesser level of detail in another. The authors of this
study particularly found it difficult to identify and code the
primary disability category of students. Decisions issued in
more recent years provided less straightforward statements
of the primary disability category indicated on the student's
IEP, and instead provided greater levels of descriptiveness
regarding evaluation report findings, witness testimony, and
areas of student need. When it was not clear that one disabil-
ity category was primary, these data were coded as "multiple
disabilities." The potential impact of this issue on the data set
is addressed below in a discussion of the findings related to
student disability categories.
Implications and Areas for Future Research
The disproportionate percentage of issues and hearings on
which Massachusetts school districts prevail is an area for
concern. Over the 8 years of this study, school districts
prevailed in 55.0% of hearings and received a mixed decision
in an additional 24.4%. When disaggregated to the level of
specific issues addressed in hearings, school districts pre-
vailed on 62.5% of all issues and received a mixed decision in
an additional 10.3%. This finding is consistent with research
from four other studies conducted in the past 15 years in other
jurisdictions (Cope-Kasten, 2013; Mueller & Carranza, 2011;
Newcomer & Zirkel, 1999; Rickey, 2003).
The authors of this study theorize that the unbalanced
results in outcomes could be the result of unequal access to
professional legal advice and representation. This can affect
the outcome of special education disputes in two ways. First,
there is the possibility that inadequate information and legal
advice is available to parents when making decisions on
whether to take a dispute to due process hearing. The find-
ings in this study indicated that parents were more likely to
represent themselves with or without advocate support than
they were to enlist attorney representation. When parents did
represent themselves, they frequently did not win, prevailing
in only 10.7% of hearings in which they represented them-
selves pro se and 20.5% of hearings in which they were pro
se with advocate support. In this case, we are seeing high
volumes of parents with access to limited information choos-
ing to take issues into a very costly and time-consuming pro-
cess in which they will often not prevail. Another possibility
is that school districts have greater access to professional
expertise and legal representation that provide effective sup-
ports for determining which issues to take to due process and
for presenting evidence and arguments at the hearings. In this
study, school districts utilized attorney representation in
100% of the due process hearings and prevailed in the major-
ity of hearings and on the majority of issues.
Based on these findings, the authors agree with Cope-
Kasten (2013) and Johnson (2005) that due process hearings
may not represent a fair means of resolving special education
disputes. At the most fundamental level, it appears that par-
ents are not able and/or willing to access the same level of
professional legal expertise that school districts access. A
major factor in this issue is likely due to the real or perceived
costs of attorney representation. State government initiatives
to create programs that provide pro bono attorney representa-
tion for parents could be one possibility for alleviating this
issue. A potential area for future research is to examine avail-
able programs across states to determine the extent to which
affordable attorney representation is provided for parents.
This research could be an important update to earlier research
from Ahearn (2002) that found that states that did collect
data on attorney representation reported issues with securing
affordable representation for families.
A stated goal of this study was to uncover information
from due process hearings that could shed light on potential
ways to effectively resolve conflicts sooner and at a lower
fiscal and relationship cost than occurs during due process
hearings. As Mueller (2009) has suggested, the use of alter-
native dispute resolution strategies such as IEP facilitation,

parent-to-parent assistance, and third-party consultation are
mechanisms that are less reliant on legal expertise and finan-
cial resources, and could reduce the considerable advantage
that school districts appear to have when taking issues to due
process hearings. However, the authors of this study found
very limited information available in the written hearing
decisions regarding the extent to which alternative dispute
resolution procedures had been attempted or the types of pro-
cedures that had been utilized. This is an area for future
research, both within Massachusetts and across other juris-
dictions. Additional research in this area could potentially
help make the case that the next reauthorization of IDEA
should include provisions that require school personnel and
parents to demonstrate that they have attempted multiple
alternative dispute resolution strategies prior to any case
moving forward to a due process hearing. Although the reso-
lution meeting requirement that was added in 2004 was a
move in the right direction, further steps likely need to be
taken that address potential disagreements much earlier in
the process.
The findings from this study indicate that many of the
issuesaddressedduringdueprocesshearingsinMassachusetts
are related to IEP development/implementation and educa-
tional program placement. This finding is consistent with
previous studies in other locations from Cope-Kasten (2013),
Mueller and Carranza (2011), Newcomer and Zirkel (1999),
and Rickey (2003). This is an important issue to address as it
directly relates to the IDEA mandate of providing eligible
students with a free appropriate public education in the least
restrictive environment (IDEA, 2004b, 2004c). It is possible
that there is a need to reconsider the effectiveness of the pro-
cess for developing IEPs and determining the educational
environment for students receiving special education ser-
vices. Research on the development and quality of IEPs has
consistently demonstrated that (a) schools struggle to meet
the procedural requirements associated with IEP develop-
ment, (b) IEPs are often not individualized to meet the unique
needs of each child, and (c) parents are often not meaningful
participants in the program development process (see
Blackwell & Rossetti, 2014, for a review of literature on IEP
development). The previous research on education place-
ment has presented a picture of legal, programmatic, and
philosophical challenges related to determining the least
restrictive environment for students (Kavale & Forness,
2000). Future research across multiple states could focus
more directly on issues related to IEP development/imple-
mentation and educational program placement within the
context of due process hearings. The research could poten-
tially enable state policy makers and authors of the next
IDEA reauthorization to find ways to promote more collab-
orative models for student program development.
The findings related to student characteristics presented a
few potentially noteworthy issues. First, the data indicated
that there has been an increase in recent years in the percent-
age of disputes involving students in outside placements
such as public and private day schools, residential schools,
and hospital settings. The authors feel that this is not surpris-
ing, and it is likely that more disputes would arise involving
the placement of students in higher cost settings. Future
research could focus on this issue in other state contexts to
determine if a larger pattern is emerging.
Second, the data indicated that there were a high percent-
age of students with multiple disabilities (29.1%), with a
marked increase over the past 4 years. This finding was con-
sistent with earlier research in other jurisdictions from
Newcomer and Zirkel (1999), but was not supported by later
research from Mueller and Carranza (2011). As discussed in
the limitations section, there were inconsistencies and a gen-
eral lack of clarity in the ways that disability information was
described in the written hearing decisions. As a result of this
lack of consistency and clarity, the authors may have used
the "multiple disabilities" code during analysis more fre-
quently than IEP teams would typically use this category
during eligibility determination processes. However, even
with this caution in mind, the authors believe that it stands to
reason that there could be increased disagreement on the
methods and approaches for educating students with more
complex educational support needs, such as those students
identified as having multiple disabilities. As the amount of
research continues to expand on human cognition and devel-
opment, the amount of available information and theories on
how best to respond to this information also expands. This
scenario could result in an increase in competing theories on
educational supports for students with multiple, complex dis-
abilities. Additional research is needed on this issue. A multi-
state study that more closely examines due process hearings
involving students with multiple disabilities could shed fur-
ther light onto this issue.
Finally, the data indicated that there has been a steady
decline in the percentage of due process hearings that
involved students with specific learning disabilities (44.7%
in FY07, 24.3% in FY09, 15.6% in FY11, and 3.7% in FY13)
and students with emotional/behavioral impairments (28.0%
in FY06, 19.9% in FY09, and 3.7% in FY13). The authors
hypothesize that there could be two potential explanations
for these apparent trends. One possibility is that school dis-
trict personnel and parents are utilizing the increasing amount
of research available on how to best educate and support stu-
dents with specific learning disabilities and students with
emotional/behavioral impairments. As the available knowl-
edge base is increasing and becoming more widely available,
parties are better able to make effective programmatic and
placement decisions, thereby reducing the number of poten-
tial disagreements that could result in due process hearings.
The other possibility is that the challenges with coding the
primary disability category during the analysis phase of this
study may explain the apparent decrease in the percentage of
students with emotional/behavioral disabilities and specific
learning disabilities involved in due process hearings. In re-
checking the disability codes used from FY09 to FY13, the
10 SAGE Open
authors noted that the due process hearing decisions written
in these years frequently provided detailed descriptions of
both the academic and emotional/behavioral challenges
faced by students, but often did not include a clear statement
of the primary disability category. The authors coded these
cases as "multiple disabilities," when it could be the case that
the student IEP identified one specific primary disability cat-
egory. Additional research is needed before any reasonable
conclusions can be reached regarding the prevalence of stu-
dents with specific learning disabilities and students with
emotional/behavioral disabilities involved in due process
hearings.
Conclusion
Of the three formal dispute resolution procedures provided
by IDEA (2004), due process hearings are the most costly
in terms of time, fiscal resources, and impact on relation-
ships between school personnel and parents (Cope-Kasten,
2013; Mueller, 2009). The findings from this study indi-
cated that Massachusetts school districts utilized attorney
representation and won due process hearings at notably
higher levels than parents. The findings also indicated that
the most frequently addressed issues at due process hear-
ings were IEP development/implementation and educa-
tional program placement, which are issues that represent
the core mandate of IDEA to provide a free appropriate
public education in the least restrictive environment (IDEA,
2004b, 2004c). It is hoped that the findings and discussion
presented in this article can help inform practices in
Massachusetts and other state settings so that special edu-
cation disputes are addressed sooner and more effectively,
thereby resulting in more equitable dispute outcomes for
parents and school districts.
