Compared to whites, blacks experience a higher prevalence
of hypertension and are diagnosed at younger ages,1­3 but the
sources of disparities are not well understood. Controlling for
age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), health status, and
health behaviors has only partially explained disparities.4,5
A number of psychosocial measures have been associated with
hypertension,5­9 including social support.5,10 Social support
is the product of interpersonal relationships that may directly
affect health or act as a buffer against stressors that are delete-
rious to health.11,12 Studies restricted to all white or all black
samples have found greater levels of social support to be asso-
ciated with lower blood pressure (BP) or lower incidence of
hypertension.6,10,13­18
Studies of race differences in the amount and type of social
support received have been conducted with conflicting results.
When race differences were found, blacks were less likely to
receive social support,19 more likely to have smaller social

networks, and more likely to have social support come from
family members as compared to whites.19,20 Other studies have
found that whites and blacks give and receive similar amounts
of social support,21­23 specifically among older populations,
where the need for social support may be more evident, and
thus may be received more frequently.
Race/ethnic differences in social support may play an impor-
tant role in the association between race/ethnicity and hyper-
tension. However, studies of the inter-relationship between
race, social support, and hypertension are scarce.10,24 There
is also a dearth of research on ethnicity, social support, and
hypertension, particularly comparing Hispanics to non-His-
panic whites.25 Among Hispanics, Mexican Americans are the
largest minority group in the United States.26 The prevalence
of hypertension is lower among Mexican Americans compared
to whites.27 However, studies of the effect of social support on
hypertension in Mexican Americans or on ethnic differences
in hypertension are few.28 In general, Mexican Americans
receive more support from family than friends,29 and a higher
level of social support among Mexican Americans has been
proposed as a reason for a lower prevalence of hypertension
compared to whites.30
Because social support may buffer against stressors that
lead to hypertension, the strength of the association between

Race/Ethnicity and Hypertension: The Role
of Social Support
Caryn N. Bell1,2, Roland J.Thorpe Jr.1,2 andThomas A. LaVeist1,2
Background
Social support is an important determinant of health, yet
understanding of its contribution to racial disparities in
hypertension is limited. Many studies have focused on the
relationship between hypertension and social support, or
race/ethnicity and social support, but few have examined the
inter-relationship between race/ethnicity, social support, and
hypertension.The objective of this study was to determine
whether the relationship between race/ethnicity and hypertension
varied by level of social support.
Methods
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2001­2006 were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for
the association between hypertension and race/ethnicity by levels of
social support. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure
(BP) 140mmHg and/or diastolic BP 90mmHg or having been
prescribed antihypertensive medication. Social support was defined
by emotional and financial support, and marital status.
Results
Black/white ORs of hypertension increased as social support
decreased; that is, the race difference among those without
social support was larger compared to those with social support.
Contrarily, Mexican American/white ethnic differences were only
observed among those with social support; Mexican Americans
with social support had lower odds of hypertension than their white
counterparts.
Conclusions
This study observed that the relationship between race (but not
ethnicity) and hypertension varies by social support level. Results
suggest there may be beneficial effects of social support on
hypertension among blacks, however, the possible impact of social
support on ethnic differences in hypertension remains unclear.

Race/Ethnicity, Hypertension, and Social Support
race and hypertension may be weaker among those with
social support as compared to those without social support.
Conversely, because the prevalence of hypertension among
Mexican Americans is lower compared to whites,27 ethnic

differences will be greatest among those with social support;
that is, the odds of hypertension should be lowest among
Mexican Americans with the most social support, thus the
Mexican-American/white odds ratio (OR) of hypertension
should be lowest among those with the most social support
and should approach one as social support decreases. Hence,
the objective of this study is to determine whether the associa-
tion between race (black vs. white) and hypertension, and eth-
nicity (Mexican American vs. white) and hypertension varies
by level of social support. Specifically, it is hypothesized that
the race differences in hypertension will be attenuated among
those with social support as compared to those without social
support, and ethnic differences will be greater among those
with social support compared to those without social support.
Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is an ongoing nationally representative survey
of the health, functional, and nutritional statuses of the US
population. Each sequential series of this cross-sectional sur-
vey samples the civilian noninstitutionalized population, with
an oversample of low-income individuals, participants aged
between 12 and 19 years, adults over the age of 60 years, blacks,
and Mexican Americans.31 This survey uses a stratified, multi-
stage probability sampling design where data are collected
in two phases. First, information regarding the participant's
health history, health behaviors, and risk factors is obtained
during a home interview. Then participants are invited to take
part in a medical examination where they receive a detailed
physical examination.32 Social support questions were only
asked of participants aged 40 years, therefore, data from 2001
to 2006 were combined, excluded those missing BP meas-
urements and consisted of 5,593 non-Hispanic black, non-
Hispanic white (hereafter referred to as black and white), and
Mexican-American adults.
Study variables. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP
140mmHg and/or diastolic BP 90mmHg or currently tak-
ing antihypertensive medication. Hypertension was measured
following NHANES protocol by calculating average BP, exclud-
ing the first measurement.32 For whites and blacks, race was
assessed by the response to the question, "What race do you
consider yourself to be?" Mexican American respondents were
included if they considered themselves Hispanic/Latino and
being Mexican American represented their Hispanic origin or
ancestry. Social support was assessed by emotional support,
financial support, and marital status. Emotional support was
assessed by the following: "Can you count on anyone to pro-
vide you with emotional support such as talking over problems
or helping you make a difficult decision?" (responses were yes,
no, "don't need help"). Financial support was assessed by the
following: "If you need some extra help financially, could you
count on anyone to help you; for example, by paying any bills,
housing costs, hospital visits, or providing you with food or
clothes?" (responses were yes, no, "offered help but wouldn't
accept it"). A categorical variable was created to represent hav-
ing both emotional and financial support (yes to both social
support measures), either form of social support (yes to one,
but not both measures of social support), and neither form
of social support (no to both measures). Sensitivity analyses
were performed to determine the effect of including those who
refused to respond, were uncertain of, or did not need/would
not accept support (n = 215) in the "Neither" group, and deter-
mined these persons to be meaningful. Social support was also
assessed by current marital status (yes/no).
Demographic variables included age (years) and gender (1 =
male; 0 = female). SES was assessed using binary variables for
incomecategories(<$20,000,$20,000­44,999,$45,000­74,999,
$75,000), and education categories (less than high school
graduate, high school graduate or general equivalency diploma
equivalent recipient, more than high school education).
Health-related characteristics included having health insur-
ance (1 = yes; 0 = no), diabetes (1 = yes; 0 = no), obesity (1 =
body mass index (BMI)  30; 0 = BMI < 30), fair/poor health
(1 = yes; 0 = no), and physical inactivity (1 = not regularly
physically active; 0 = regularly physically active).
Data analysis strategy. The mean and proportional differences
between race/ethnic groups for demographic, SES, and health-
related characteristics were evaluated using Student's t-tests for
continuous variables and 2-tests for categorical variables. The
odds of hypertension among blacks and Mexican Americans
compared to whites were calculated using logistic regres-
sion models controlling for demographic, SES, health-related
characteristics (Model 1). Analyses additionally controlled
for emotional and financial support (Model 2), and marital

status (Model 3) to determine the effect of these social support
measures on the race/ethnic ORs of hypertension. Analyses to
determine whether social support modified the effect of race/
ethnicity on hypertension were performed using multiplica-
tive interaction terms.33 If interaction was detected, race and
ethnic differences in odds of hypertension were determined
within levels of social support, that is, among those with both,
either/or and neither/nor emotional and financial support,
and among married and unmarried persons. Following the
procedure recommended by the National Center for Health
Statistics,34 all analyses used Taylor-linearization procedures
for the complex multistage sampling design and a weight vari-
able was created to account for combining multiple years of
NHANES. P values <0.05 were considered statistically signifi-
cant and all t-tests were two-sided. All statistical procedures
were performed using STATA statistical software, version 10
(StataCorp, College Station, TX).

and had worse SES profiles than whites. Blacks and Mexican
Americans were less likely to be insured, and more likely to
report fair/poor health, and be diabetic and physically inac-
tive compared to whites. Blacks were less likely to be male
and more likely to be obese than whites. Compared to whites,
a greater percentage of blacks were hypertensive (60.1% vs.
45.7%, P < 0.001), whereas Mexican Americans were less
likely to be hypertensive (60.1% vs. 33.5%, P < 0.001). Blacks
and whites had a similar distribution of emotional and finan-
cial support, whereas Mexican Americans were less likely
to have both emotional and financial support than whites
(P < 0.001). Similar percentages of Mexican Americans were
not married when compared to whites (29.1% vs. 29.5%,
P = 0.852), while blacks were more likely to not be married
(51.6%, P < 0.001).
Table 2 presents the association between race/ethnicity,
social support, and hypertension for adults aged 40 years.
In Model 1, controlling for demographics, SES, and health-
related characteristics, blacks had higher odds of hypertension
than whites (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.68­2.36), and Mexican
Americans had lower odds (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.52­0.92).
Model 2 adjusts for covariates in Model 1 plus emotional
and financial support. Emotional and financial support were
not predictive of hypertension. In Model 3, which adjusts for

marital status as well as covariates in Model 1, marital status is
not predictive of hypertension. Neither emotional and finan-
cial support nor marital status affected the race/ethnicity ORs
of hypertension.
Interaction between race/ethnicity and each social support
measure is evaluated in Table 3. Only the interaction between
race and having emotional and financial support was signifi-
cant. The black/white OR in those who have neither emotional
nor financial support is more than two times greater than
in those with both forms of support (OR = 2.21, 95% CI =
1.04­4.69).
Adjusted race ORs of hypertension stratified by social sup-
port are presented in Table 4. Black/white ORs are greatest in
those with neither emotional nor financial support (OR = 5.82,
95% CI = 2.41­14.0), and odds ratios decrease as social support
increases. Among those with either emotional or financial sup-
port, blacks had more than two times the odds of being hyper-
tensive compared to whites (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.23­4.22).
Blacks with both emotional and financial support had almost
two times the odds of being hypertensive than their white
counterparts (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.58­2.10). A 
similar trend
is observed comparing the black/white OR among unmarried

persons vs. married persons. However, race differences did not
vary by marital status.
Among Mexican Americans, ethnic differences in hyper-
tension were only observed among those with the most social
support. Mexican Americans with both emotional and finan-
cial support were less likely to be hypertensive than their white
counterparts (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.48­0.91). Among other
groups, the Mexican-American/white OR of hypertension was
not significant, but there seems to be a downward trend. The
ethnic OR of hypertension was significant among married per-
sons but not among unmarried persons.
Discussion
There is abundant evidence demonstrating race/ethnic dif-
ferences in hypertension.1­3,27 Social support is also a well-
documented determinant of hypertension.5,10,14­18 However,
the inter-relationships among race/ethnicity, hypertension,
and social support have not been clearly explicated. It was
hypothesized that race differences in the odds of hyperten-
sion would decrease as social support increased, and ethnic
differences would increase as social support increased. The
findings of this study indicate that race differences in hyper-
tension were reduced among those who received both emo-
tional and financial support compared to those who received
neither of these, consistent with the study hypothesis.
However, race differences did not vary by marital status. As
hypothesized, Mexican Americans with both forms of social
support had lower odds of hypertension than their white
counterparts, whereas ethnic differences were not observed
among those with either emotional or financial support or
those with neither emotional nor financial support. Ethnic
differences were observed among married but not unmarried
persons. However, the interactions between neither social
support and ethnicity nor marital status and ethnicity were
significant.
Other studies examining the inter-relationship of race,
hypertension, and social support are few. One study examined
race differences in self-reported hypertension controlling for
social support and found that social support explained only
3% of the effect of race on hypertension,24 as in the present
study (Table 2); however, they did not stratify by social sup-
port. In contrast, another study found that the unadjusted

original contributions Race/Ethnicity, Hypertension, and Social Support
odds of hypertension were significantly greater among persons

without social support compared to persons with social sup-
port in black and white adults.10 After adjusting for covariates,
there was no relationship between social support and hyper-
tension for whites, but social support remained a significant
predictor among blacks. Though the methodology between
this study and the present study differ, they both demonstrate
that social support is an important factor in the relationship
between race and hypertension.
When examining race differences by social support, the
black/white OR decreased as emotional and financial sup-
port increased. The larger race OR among those with neither
form of social support is likely due to the decreased odds of
hypertension among whites with neither emotional nor finan-
cial support. Whites in the neither group had decreased odds
of hypertension (Table 3) only when whites who responded
that they did not need emotional support or would not accept
financial support were included in the neither group. Thus,
whites who responded that they did not need or would not
accept support had lower odds of hypertension than whites
who reported having both forms of support. The literature
finds little evidence for a negative effect of social support on
health,12 but there is no research on possible positive effects
of not needing or wanting social support. To further compli-
cate these results, it is unknown whether those persons who
responded that they did not need or would not accept social
support actually have those resources, but do not acknowledge
them.
Two theories, main effects and buffering effects, have been
used to describe how social support is related to health. The
main effects of social support find a direct beneficial effect on
health by lowering BP or influencing health behaviors such as
exercise, and sleep or eating habits.11,12 The buffering hypoth-
esis finds that social support is beneficial to health only when
stress threatens health, that is, social support buffers against
the deleterious effects of stress on health.11,12 Because lower
odds of hypertension were associated with not needing or
wanting social support among whites, this may suggest buff-
ering effects of social support rather than main effects. The
main effects theory of social support intrinsically relies on the
notion that health and social support are positively related. It is
only within the paradigm of the buffering hypothesis of social
support that the results of this study can be interpreted; how-
ever, because stress was not included in this study, testing the
buffering hypothesis could not be done.
Even more paradoxical is the relationship between social
support and hypertension among blacks. Because the

Race/Ethnicity, Hypertension, and Social Support

interaction between social support and race was likely due to
whites with neither form of social support, it is possible that
the odds of hypertension do not vary by social support among
blacks. Though this is contrary to some studies,10 it may give
some insight into social support mechanisms. Blacks are dis-
proportionately represented in lower SES groups and are more
likely to experience discrimination, be exposed to stressful sit-
uations and live under adverse conditions.35,36 These may lead
to experiences of chronic stress among blacks.35,36 Indeed,
studies have found that blacks exhibit higher levels of physi-
ologic response to stress than whites.37 If blacks experience
stressors constantly, the buffering effects of social support may
be ineffective.
Contrary to other studies, Mexican Americans received less
social support than whites, thus the effects of social support
on ethnic differences may be masked. Also, other factors such
as support from family vs. friends may have yielded results
more similar to the literature. 29 In light of this, the relation-
ship between ethnicity and hypertension appears not to differ
by level of social support. Studies have shown that discrimi-
nation stress is associated with health only among Mexican
Americans with low levels of social support,30 indicating a
protective effect. Though Mexican Americans may experience
constant stressors such as lower SES environments and accul-
turative stress,30 the mechanism by which Mexican Americans
interpret and deal with stressors (here, by social support) may
differ from blacks and may not differ from whites.
This study advances our understanding of race/ethnic dif-
ferences in hypertension by highlighting the importance of
social support on the relationship between race/ethnicity and
hypertension. By combining emotional and financial support,
and assessing the influence of marital status, the study uses
more than one measure of social support which is consistent
with theory that suggests that social support is obtained from
a number of sources, in a number of ways.38 Moreover, this
study is one of few that uses marital status to assess the race/
ethnic differences in hypertension in a nationally representa-
tive sample.25 The results of this study should be considered
within the context of some limitations. In NHANES 2001­
2006, only persons >40 years were administered questions on
social support. Social support has been found to be related to
hypertension/BP in studies including persons <age 40.10,13,14
Future studies that include these persons in surveys that assess
social support would be useful. Although both emotional and
financial support were assessed, satisfaction with social sup-
port (such as marital quality), which has been linked to health
as well,12 could not be assessed. Family vs. friend support could
not be assessed using this data set, which may be important
because race and ethnic differences in sources of support have
been cited in the literature.19,20,29,30,39,40 Including alcohol use
and smoking status rendered interaction analyses insignifi-
cant. However, because alcohol use and smoking status were
not related to hypertension or social support, these variables
were not included in the analyses. Furthermore, NHANES
oversamples only Mexican Americans among Hispanics, and
data on other Hispanic subgroups is not publicly available.
It is unknown whether these relationships are true for other
Hispanic subgroups.
This study observed that the relationship between race and
hypertension varies by social support level, although this
variation was not seen for ethnicity. The results of this study
suggest there may be beneficial effects of social support on
hypertension among blacks, but the observed decrease in
black/white ORs with an increase in social support may be
due to the relationship between social support and hyperten-
sion among whites, rather than among blacks. The study was
