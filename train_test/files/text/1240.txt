ABSTRACT
Background: Changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
concentrations in the US population have not been described.
Objective: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) to compare serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations in the US population in 2000­2004 with those in 1988­
1994 and to identify contributing factors.
Design: Serum 25(OH)D was measured with a radioimmunoassay
kit in 20 289 participants in NHANES 2000­2004 and in 18 158
participants in NHANES III (1988­1994). Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated from measured height and weight. Milk intake and
sun protection were assessed by questionnaire. Assay differences
were assessed by re-analyzing 150 stored serum specimens from
NHANES III with the current assay.
Results: Age-adjusted mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations were
5­20 nmol/L lower in NHANES 2000­2004 than in NHANES III.
After adjustment for assay shifts, age-adjusted means in NHANES
2000­2004 remained significantly lower (by 5­9 nmol/L) in most
males, but not in most females. In a study subsample, adjustment for
the confounding effects of assay differences changed mean serum
25(OH)D concentrations by 10 nmol/L, and adjustment for
changes in the factors likely related to real changes in vitamin D
status (ie, BMI, milk intake, and sun protection) changed mean
serum 25(OH)D concentrations by 1­1.6 nmol/L.
Conclusions: Overall, mean serum 25(OH)D was lower in 2000­
2004 than 1988­1994. Assay changes unrelated to changes in vita-
minDstatusaccountedformuchofthedifferenceinmostpopulation
groups. In an adult subgroup, combined changes in BMI, milk in-
take, and sun protection appeared to contribute to a real decline in
vitamin D status. Am J Clin Nutr 2008;88:1519­27.
INTRODUCTION
Interest in vitamin D status is high, because of its potential
links with an increasing number of diseases and conditions (1).
The vitamin D status of the population has not been assessed in
a representative sample of the current US population; the most
recent published national estimates are based on data that are
more than a decade old (2). Since the time of those data, there
have been trends in other factors in the population that could
potentially affect vitamin D status. For example, the prevalence
of overweight increased in the US population in the past decade
(3, 4). Body fat is inversely related to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
D [25(OH)D] (5), but it is not known whether the increase in the
prevalence of overweight has been accompanied by a decline in
vitamin D status. A clear understanding of changes in the vitamin
D status of the US population and of factors that may have
contributed to these changes is relevant in light of the consider-
able efforts currently underway to better define the role of this
important vitamin in health (6­9).
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured in the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for
the first time in the third NHANES (1988­1994), and they have
been part of the current continuous NHANES process since
2000. These data provide the opportunity to compare vitamin D
status in representative samples of the noninstitutionalized US
population who were assessed at 2 different time-points. The
objectives of the present study are 1) to describe current
25(OH)D concentrations in a wide range of population sub-
groups, including children aged 1­11 y and pregnant women, for
whom national estimates have not previously been available and
2) to compare differences in serum 25(OH)D between NHANES
III and NHANES 2000­2004 before and after adjustment for
assay method changes. We also performed exploratory analyses
to compare the relative contributions of confounding from assay
method with the combined effects of biological and behavioral
factors (eg, body mass index, sun protection, and milk consump-
tion) that may have contributed to observed differences over
time.Thisevaluationwaslimitedtoasinglepopulationsubgroup
for which data on these factors were available. Identifying the
contribution of confounding factors is essential to avoiding er-
roneous conclusions about observed changes in the population's
vitamin D status, because changes in confounding factors are
unrelated to changes in vitamin D status over time. Identifying
biological and behavioral factors that contribute to a real change

can best be addressed.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects
Vitamin D status was assessed by using data from the
NHANES, which is conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention(CDC)toassessthehealthandnutritionalstatusofalarge
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US
population. In NHANES III, a nationally representative sample
was obtained in two cycles between 1988 and 1994, whereas in
NHANES 2000­2004, a nationally representative sample was
collected in each year. Although a representative sample is col-
lected annually, data are released in 2-y periods to protect con-
fidentiality and increase statistical reliability. These data release
increments began in 1999, however, serum 25(OH)D was not
added to the survey until 2000, and thus the serum 25(OH)D data
from the year 2000 are available only through the NCHS Re-
search Data Center. Serum 25(OH)D data from 2000­2002 and
2003­2004 are publicly available on the NCHS website, how-
ever.
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. All
procedures in each NHANES were approved by the NCHS In-
stitutional Review Board.
Methods
In each NHANES, data were collected via household inter-
views and direct standardized physical examinations conducted
in specially equipped mobile examination centers (10, 11). Be-
cause the mobile examination centers can be adversely affected
byweather,dataarecollectedinnorthernlatitudesinsummerand
in southern latitudes in winter. This procedure created a season-
latitude structure in both surveys, in which 75% of the data
collected from November through March came from latitudes
35 °N, and 86% of the data collected from April through
October came from latitudes 35 °N.
NHANES III and NHANES 2000­2004 were designed to
provide reliable estimates for 3 racial-ethnic groups: non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans.
Race and ethnicity were self-reported by the participants. Be-
cause racial-ethnic groups are not evenly distributed geograph-
ically across the United States, the season-latitude aspect of the
survey affects racial-ethnic comparisons (2). In both surveys,
non-Hispanic whites were significantly more likely to have been
examined in April­October and to be living at higher latitudes
than were either non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican Americans (P
 0.05). Furthermore, the racial-ethnic composition of the US
population has changed since the 1990s because of an increase in
the Hispanic population (12), which may explain why race-
ethnicity differed significantly between surveys for the sample
examined in November­March (See Table S1 under "Supple-
mental data" in the current online issue). Significantly more
Mexican Americans and persons of other races (and concomi-
tantlyfewernon-Hispanicwhitesandnon-Hispanicblacks)were
examined in these months in NHANES 2000­2004 than in
NHANES III.
The present study used serum 25(OH)D measurements from
20 289 persons from NHANES 2000­2004 (11 995 persons
aged 6 y from NHANES 2000­2002; 8294 persons aged 1 y
from NHANES 2003­2004). The analytic sample size for
NHANES 2000­2004 represents 69% of the persons who were
originally selected for the survey and 90% of those examined in
the survey. Serum 25(OH)D measurements from 18 158 persons
aged12yinNHANESIIIwereusedinthepresentstudy,which
represents 67% of those originally selected for the survey and
92% of those examined in the survey.
The description of the observed difference in serum 25(OH)D
in the population is based on data collected in NHANES III
(1988­1994) and NHANES 2000­2004. However, data from
the current NHANES that were used to assess potential explan-
atory factors for the observed serum 25(OH)D difference had to
be limited to NHANES 2003­2004 because sun protection data
were not collected in NHANES before 2003. Information on sun
protection also was not collected in NHANES III, and therefore
data from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
were used to assess sun protection in the population at the time of
NHANES III. The NHIS annually obtains a nationally represen-
tative sample; the study is conducted via household interview
(13). The items on sun protection were part of the Cancer Control
Supplement administered to 12 035 adults aged 18 y in 1992.
The response rate to this supplement was 87% (13). All proce-
dures in the 1992 NHIS were also approved by the NCHS Insti-
tutional Review Board, and written informed consent was ob-
tained from all subjects. For the present study, the age range of
the 1992 NHIS sample was limited to 20­59 y old, to be com-
parable to the age range in NHANES 2003­2004 with sun pro-
tection data. Sun protection data were available for 8697 adults,
who represented 99% of the Cancer Control Supplement partic-
ipants in that age range.
Variables
Serum 25(OH)D measurements were performed in both
NHANES surveys at the National Center for Environmental
Health, CDC, by using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (DiaSorin,
Stillwater MN) (11, 14). According to quality-control pools that
passed specification limits, the interassay CV was 15­25% for
lower values (20­62 nmol/L) and 14­18% for higher values
(86­143 nmol/L) during NHANES III and 8.3­11% for lower
values (24­58 nmol/L) and 10% for higher values (102­112
nmol/L) during NHANES 2000­2004. Long-term participation
of this laboratory in the UK DEQAS international vitamin D
proficiency testing program (Internet: www.deqas.org) has
shown that the 25(OH)D measurements met performance tar-
gets. However, small shifts in the serum 25(OH)D assay perfor-
mance due to changes in reagent and calibrator lots over a period
of years have been observed in the CDC laboratory. The kit
manufacturer also reformulated the kit in the late 1990s by in-
troducing an antibody that improved binding. To assess whether
these changes in the assay contributed to observed differences in
population serum 25(OH)D data from NHANES, the CDC lab-
oratory reanalyzed a subset of 150 banked serum samples (stored
at70 °C)fromNHANESIIIwiththecurrentversionoftheRIA
over a 3-mo period in 2004. (For details of this study, see Ap-
pendixS1under"Supplementaldata"inthecurrentonlineissue.)
Pregnancy status in NHANES 2000­2004 was based on a pos-
itive urinary pregnancy test or self-reported pregnancy.

Data for the following vitamin D­related variables from
NHANES III and NHANES 2003­2004 were used when ana-
lyzing trends in vitamin D status: body mass index (BMI; in
kg/m2), season and latitude of blood collection, dietary calcium
intake, frequency and type of milk consumption, vitamin-
mineral supplement (VMS) use in the past month, and physical
activity level. BMI was calculated. Body weight was measured
by using an electronic load cell scale, and standing height was
measured with a fixed stadiometer (10, 11). Latitude and season
were based on the geographical location and the month of blood
specimen collection. Dietary calcium intake from food was
based on a single 24-h recall. Milk intake was based on self-
reported frequency of consumption in the past month. The ques-
tions on milk intake differed slightly between the 2 surveys. In
NHANES 2003­2004, respondents were instructed not to in-
clude milk used in cooking in their responses, whereas NHANES
III respondents did not receive that instruction. In addition, milk
consumption was coded as times consumed per month in
NHANES III. To be comparable with milk consumption in
NHANES 2003­2004, responses from NHANES III were re-
coded as "never or rarely" (0­3 times/mo) or "sometimes or
often" (4 times/mo). Type of milk was based on the fat content
(ie, whole, 2%, 1%, or skim or nonfat milk) of the milk that was
self-reported as usually consumed. VMS use was based on self-
reported use of any type of supplement in the past month. Phys-
ical activity was based on self-assessment of usual activity com-
pared with others of the same age and sex. Responses were coded
as "more," "same," and "less."
Data on sun protection from the 1992 NHIS and from
NHANES 2003­2004 also were used in the analysis of vitamin
D status trends. In both surveys, respondents were asked whether
they practiced the following behaviors if they were outside for
1 h on a sunny day: stay in the shade, wear protective clothing
(eg, long sleeves or hat with brim), or use sunscreen. Response
categories differed between the surveys, and thus responses to
NHANES 2003­2004 items were recoded to be comparable to
the 1992 NHIS by combining "always" and "most of the time" to
represent "very likely," using "sometimes" to represent "some-
what likely," and combining "rarely" and "never" to represent
"unlikely." Respondents who reported not going out into the sun
in NHANES 2003­2004 were excluded (n  40), because there
wasnocomparableresponsecategoryinthe1992NHIS.Asingle
sun-protection variable was created by assigning the highest
frequency reported for any of the 3 behaviors. For example, a
respondent who reported being "very likely" to stay in the shade
was coded as "very likely" to practice sun protection overall,
even if he or she did not report wearing protective clothing or
using sunscreen.
Data analyses
Sample weights were used in calculations of point estimates in
all analyses. Analyses were performed by using SUDAAN soft-
ware [version 9.01; Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri-
angle Park, NC (15)]. Data collected in the contiguous United
States (25­47 °N) from both surveys were included in the anal-
yses. The distribution of race-ethnicity by season of blood col-
lection was compared between NHANES III and NHANES
2000­2004 by using chi-square analyses. Means, selected per-
centiles, and prevalence with serum 25(OH)D below selected
thresholdsforNHANES2000­2004werecalculatedbyage,sex,
and race-ethnicity. Adjusted means by selected characteristics
(ie, age, sex, race-ethnicity, season of blood collection, and, for
women of child-bearing age, pregnancy status) also were calcu-
lated for NHANES 2000­2004 by using multiple linear regres-
sion. The mean for each characteristic was adjusted for all of the
othercharacteristicsinthemodel.Whenmultiplecomparisonsof
means between groups were made, a Bonferroni correction was
used.
Changes in serum 25(OH)D in the population aged 12 y
between NHANES III and NHANES 2000­2004 were exam-
ined by calculating age-standardized means by sex and season of
blood collection for each survey period for the total population
and by race-ethnicity when possible. Data were limited to sub-
jects aged 12 y because serum 25(OH)D was not measured in
younger persons in NHANES III. Means were calculated sepa-
rately by season and sex to avoid confounding due to differences
in the racial-ethnic composition of the sample by season between
surveys, and because an interaction was also found between sex
and survey. Means were age-standardized to 2000 US Cen-
sus population estimates. Regression models that included
NHANES survey and age were used to test the significance of
observed differences. These models were run separately by sex,
season, and race-ethnicity. When multiple comparisons were
made, a Bonferroni correction was used. Because the proportion
of nonwhites in the sample examined in November­March dif-
fered significantly between surveys, the sample used in the com-
parison for this season was limited to non-Hispanic whites.
Age-adjusted means of the serum 25(OH)D concentrations
were compared between NHANES III and NHANES 2000­
2004 before and after adjustment for assay differences detected
in the comparison study (See Appendix S1 under "Supplemental
data" in the current online issue). The NHANES III values were
predicted by using the following equation:

potential explanatory factors for the observed difference in se-
rum25(OH)Dbetweensurveyswerelimitedtoasinglesubpopu-
lation group because data for some relevant factors were not
available for all groups from both surveys. In specific, to avoid
confounding due to differences in the racial-ethnic composition
of the sample by season between surveys, the analyses were
limited to a subsample of non-Hispanic whites who were exam-
ined in April­October. We chose April­October because the
observed difference in serum 25(OH)D between surveys was
greater for the sample examined during that season than for the
sample examined during November­March. We limited the
comparison to non-Hispanic whites because the sample size for
April­October was greatest for this racial-ethnic group. Data
from the current NHANES were limited to 2003­2004 because
sun protection data were available only for these survey years.
The analyses were focused on persons aged 20­59 y because the
sun protection data in NHANES 2003­2004 were collected only
for that age group. Data were analyzed separately by sex because
of the previously noted sex  survey interaction. The mean age
of this subsample differed between surveys (x
: 38.1 and 40.3 y in
NHANES III and NHANES 2003­2004, respectively; P 
0.05), and thus the means were age-standardized to the 2000 US

Census. For this subsample, a 2-step modeling approach was
sequentially used: step 1) regression to predict mean serum
25(OH)D concentrations after adjustment for the confounding
effect of assay differences (NHANES III only) and step 2) re-
gression to predict mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations after
adjustment for changes in biological and behavioral factors
(NHANES 2003­2004 only).
The first step in the analyses of potential explanatory factors
was to assess the contribution of assay differences. This was
accomplished by calculating predicted mean age-standardized
serum 25(OH)D concentrations for 10 472 non-Hispanic white
adults aged 20­59 y from NHANES III on the assumption that
the current assay had been used. The predicted mean was calcu-
lated by applying the previously described regression equation
from the assay comparison study to the serum 25(OH)D data for
this NHANES III subsample.
The second step was to assess the potential contribution of
changesinvitaminD­relatedbiologicalandbehavioralfactorsin
this population subgroup between surveys. We first identified
factors that changed between 1988­1994 and 2003­2004 in a
manner consistent with the observed serum 25(OH)D changes.
Specifically, we used linear or logistic regression to compare
means or percentages of selected vitamin D­related factors be-
tween NHANES III or the 1992 NHIS and NHANES 2003­2004
for non-Hispanic whites aged 20­59 y.
Next, regression equations to assess the effect of the variables
identified in the preceding step on serum 25(OH)D data from
NHANES 2003­2004 were created for this subgroup. Regres-
sion equations to predict serum 25(OH)D concentrations by us-
ing age, latitude, physical activity, VMS use, BMI, milk intake,
and sun protection were developed separately by season and sex
because of the previously noted interactions. These regression
equations were then used to predict mean age-standardized se-
rum 25(OH)D concentrations for NHANES 2003­2004 on the
assumption that the factors identified earlier as having changed
had not changed since the mid-1990s. This step was accom-
plished by substituting means or percentages for these variables
fromthemid-1990s(eitherfromNHANESIIIorthe1992NHIS)
in the equation for values from NHANES 2003­2004 and then
calculating the adjusted mean serum 25(OH)D concentration.
RESULTS
Adjusted mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations in 2000­2004
by selected characteristics are shown for a wide range of US
population groups in Table 1. For more detailed information
about the unadjusted serum 25(OH)D distribution by age, sex,
and race-ethnicity for NHANES 2000­2004, see Table S2 (for
means, medians, and selected percentiles) and Tables S3 and S4
(for prevalence with serum 25(OH)D below selected cutoffs)
under "Supplemental data" in the current online issue. After
adjustment for sex, race-ethnicity, and season, mean serum
25(OH)D concentrations differed significantly by age: they were
highest in children aged 1­5 y and then significantly lower in
each succeeding age category. The adjusted mean serum
25(OH)D concentration was significantly higher in males than in
females and in those whose blood was drawn in April­October
than in those whose blood was drawn in November­March. Non-
Hispanic whites had the highest adjusted mean serum 25(OH)D
concentrations, followed by Mexican Americans and then non-
Hispanic blacks. Pregnant females had significantly higher ad-
justed mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations than did females
who were not pregnant.
Differences between age-standardized mean serum 25(OH)D
concentrations from NHANES III and NHANES 2000­2004 are
shown in Figure 1 for persons aged 12 y. Data were combined
for the two phases composing NHANES III (1988­1991 and
1991­1994) and for the 3 survey periods composing NHANES
2000­2004 (2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004) because means
did not differ significantly within these time periods. Age-
standardized means based on observed serum 25(OH)D concen-
trations were significantly (P  0.0003) higher (by 12­20
nmol/L in males and 5­13 nmol/L in females, depending on
season) in NHANES III than in NHANES 2000­2004 in all
groups examined. Adjustment for assay differences by predict-
ing means for NHANES III, assuming that the current assay had
been used, reduced but did not completely remove the differ-
ences between surveys. The age-standardized predicted means
for NHANES III adjusted for assay differences remained signif-
icantly higher in all male groups except the Mexican American
males examined in April­October. In contrast, the age-
standardized predicted means from NHANES III were signifi-
cantly higher in only one group of females--non-Hispanic black

females examined in April­October (Figure 1). Differences be-
tween the predicted means after adjustment for assay differences
from NHANES III and the observed means from NHANES
2000­2004 ranged from 5 to 9 nmol/L in males and from 0.7 to
6.1 nmol/L in females. These differences likely represent a real
difference in serum 25(OH)D status between surveys.
Results of the subgroup analyses to identify vitamin D­related
biological and behavioral factors that had changed significantly
between NHANES III and NHANES 2003­2004 among 20­59-
y-old non-Hispanic whites are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Of
the variables examined, BMI, milk consumption, and sun pro-
tection differed significantly between surveys in a direction that
was consistent with a decrease in serum 25(OH)D. BMI and sun
protection increased significantly and milk consumption de-
creased significantly between NHANES III and NHANES
2003­2004. As shown in Figure 2, higher BMI, lower milk
intake, and more frequent sun protection were associated with
significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations. VMS use
and dietary calcium also changed significantly between
NHANES III and NHANES 2003­2004, but the direction of the
change was not consistent with a decrease in serum 25(OH)D,
and thus these variables were not used in subsequent modeling.
Results of the multiple-step analyses to explore how much of
the observed difference in serum 25(OH)D between surveys was
duetoassaychangesandhowmuchwasduetochangesinfactors
that are truly related to vitamin D status, such as BMI, milk
intake, and sun protection, are shown in Figure 3. As noted
earlier, this analysis was limited to non-Hispanic whites aged
20­59 y who were examined between April and October in
NHANES III or NHANES 2003­2004. The effect of assay
change was assessed by statistically adjusting the serum
25(OH)D data from the NHANES III subsample for this factor,
whereas the effect of changes in BMI, milk intake, and sun
protection was assessed by adjusting the serum 25(OH)D data
from the NHANES 2003­2004 subsample for these factors. As
such, this analysis is an indirect assessment of the effect of assay
changes compared with BMI, milk intake, and sun protection
changes. The observed age-standardized means were 10­18
nmol/L higher in NHANES III than in NHANES 2003­2004 in
this population subgroup (Figure 3A). The difference in age-
standardized means between surveys was reduced by 10.3­11.2
nmol/L, depending on sex, by adjusting the NHANES III values
for assay differences: the predicted age-standardized means for
NHANES III, assuming the current assay had been used, were
only 7.1 nmol/L higher than the observed age-standardized mean
for males from NHANES 2003­2004, and the 2 means did not
differ significantly between surveys in females (Figure 3B). The
remaining difference in males likely represents a real difference
in serum 25(OH)D status between NHANES III and NHANES
2003­2004 for this subsample.
Resultsofmodelingtoassessbiologicalandbehavioralfactors
that may have contributed to a true decline in serum 25(OH)D
status between surveys in the non-Hispanic white adult subgroup
are shown in Figure 3C. Adjustment of the NHANES 2003­2004
serum 25(OH)D values for changes in mean BMI, milk con-
sumption rates, or sun protection in this subgroup reduced the
real serum 25(OH)D difference between surveys in men by 5.9
nmol/L, so that the predicted age-standardized mean after ad-
justment for assay differences for NHANES III was only 1.1
nmol/L higher than the predicted mean adjusted for biological
and behavior factors for NHANES 2003­2004. In women, ad-
justment for these population changes resulted in a predicted
age-standardized mean for NHANES 2003­2004 that was 1.6
nmol/L higher than the predicted mean for NHANES III.
DISCUSSION
A comparison of the observed serum 25(OH)D concentrations
between NHANES III and NHANES 2000­2004 suggests that a
decline in measured vitamin D status may have occurred in the
population over the past 10­15 y, because the age-standardized
mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations observed in NHANES
2000­2004 were roughly 5­20 nmol/L lower than those seen in
NHANES III (1988­1994) in persons aged 12 y. Adjustment
for confounding from assay differences reduced the difference in
serum 25(OH)D between NHANES III and NHANES 2000­
2004 by 10 nmol/L. Thus, most of the observed difference in
serum 25(OH)D between NHANES III and NHANES 2000­
2004appearstohavebeenanartifactofassaychangesratherthan
an actual decline in serum 25(OH)D concentrations. However,
the remaining difference appears to represent a true decline in the
vitamin D status of the population since NHANES III.
Our analyses to identify potential biological and behavioral
factors that contributed to the actual decline in serum 25(OH)D
values between surveys suggest that changes in BMI, milk in-
take, and sun protection may have played a role, at least in the
subgroup of non-Hispanic white adults in whom the analyses

related to serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and because they ap-
peared to have changed in a direction that is consistent with a
decline in serum 25(OH)D in this population group. These find-
ings may be relevant to future discussions of approaches to
address the decline in serum 25(OH)D. In addition, the finding
that changes in relevant biological and behavioral factors in the
populationappeartoexplainsomeportionoftheserum25(OH)D
difference remaining between surveys after adjustment for con-
founding factors supports the likelihood that this remaining se-
rum 25(OH)D difference is real rather than due to other, uncon-
trolled confounding factors. More research is needed to compare
the effects of confounding with those of behavioral and biolog-
ical factors in other population subgroups. Such analyses were
precluded in the present study because of a lack of data for some
of the relevant factors in other population groups and because of

the need to account for differences between surveys in the racial-
ethnic composition by season.
The effect of using different assays to measure serum
25(OH)D was described previously. Binkley et al (16) found that
differences in mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations between
different assay types could be as much as 2-fold when the same
set of blood samples were measured. Variations in results ob-
tained by using the same method in different laboratories also
were described (17). The results of the present study suggest that
changes of 12% in the same assay over time can also affect
serum 25(OH)D concentrations, even when the assays are per-
formed in the same laboratory. Standard reference materials for
serum 25(OH)D are currently being developed by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (18), and the use of those
standard reference materials should improve agreement between
assay methods. It is important to note that the assay adjustment
used in the present study was based on the current version of the
RIA, because the NHANES III­era RIA version could not be
reconstructed. However, without a standard reference material
for serum 25(OH)D, it is not clear which assay version is the best
in terms of assessing nutritional status.
In addition to examining trends in serum 25(OH)D, we eval-
uated mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the current
NHANES by selected demographic characteristics. These data
fill an important gap for some groups in whom data have previ-
ously been scanty--in particular, children, adolescents, and
pregnant women (19, 20). In the present study, mean serum
25(OH)D concentrations were highest in children aged 1­5 y,
intermediate in children aged 6­11 y, and lowest in adolescents
aged 12­19 y. Weng et al (21) found a similar pattern by age in
their sample of apparently healthy children and adolescents.
Pregnant women had higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations
thandidnonpregnantwomenofthesameageinNHANES2000­
2004. Recent community-based studies of vitamin D status in
pregnant women in the United States have reported that low
vitamin D status is common in this group, but those studies did
not include comparisons with nonpregnant women (20, 22).
It is important to note that statistical adjustments to serum
25(OH)D data for assay differences or biological and behavior
factors that changed between NHANES III and NHANES 2000­
2004 were made in the present study only. The publicly released
serum 25(OH)D data for NHANES III and NHANES 2000­
2004 that are available on the NHANES website (Internet: www.
cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm) are the observed, unadjusted values.
We recommend that researchers who use the publicly released
data to make comparisons between surveys should consider the
confounding effects of assay differences and changes in popu-
lation demographics in their analyses.
Thepresentstudyhadlimitations.Theanalysestocomparethe
contribution of confounding factors with changes in vitamin
D­relatedbiologicalandbehavioralriskfactorsinthepopulation
were limited to adults aged 20­59 y because of a lack of sun-
protection data in other age groups. These analyses were further
limited to non-Hispanic whites to avoid confounding due to
differences in the racial-ethnic composition of the sample by
season between surveys. A correction factor was needed to ac-
count for a shift in the 25(OH)D assay quality-control pools that
occurredwhiletheassaycomparisonstudywasbeingconducted.
The effect of the biological and behavior factors also was esti-
mated indirectly by using regression to predict mean values, so
that results depended on the robustness of the underlying models.
The models to assess changes in vitamin D­related factors in the
population were limited to factors for which nationally represen-
tative data were available, and thus some potentially important
factors could not be considered. For example, because direct
estimates of dietary vitamin D intake from food are not available

for NHANES 2000­2004, dietary intake of vitamin D was rep-
resented only indirectly by the milk intake variable in the model.
Thefactthatsomeoftheobserveddifferencesinserum25(OH)D
between NHANES III and NHANES 2003­2004 in men was not
explained by our models suggests that additional variables may
have played a role.
Other study limitations include the potential nonresponse bias
in both NHANES datasets, because not all those who were se-
lected to participate in the survey did so. Nonresponse bias in
NHANES is reduced by a nonresponse adjustment factor in-
cluded in the calculation of the sample weights. However, 5­
10% of those who came to the mobile exam centers did not have
serum 25(OH)D data in the 2 surveys, and this nonresponse is not
addressed by the sample weight adjustments. Finally, some im-
portant at-risk groups, such as institutionalized persons and per-
sons living in the northern United States during the winter, were
not included in the NHANES sampling frame by design.
In summary, age-standardized mean serum 25(OH)D concen-
trations based on observed values were significantly lower in
2000­2004 than in 1988­1994 in all groups examined. Adjust-
ment for assay changes noticeably reduced the difference be-
tween surveys. However, mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations
remained significantly lower in males (except Mexican Ameri-
cans) in NHANES 2000­2004 than in NHANES III, even after
adjustment for assay differences. This remaining difference
likely represents a real decline in vitamin D status. Changes in
BMI, milk intake, and sun protection appeared to contribute to
this decline in a subgroup of non-Hispanic white adults. The
possibility that trends in overweight, sun protection, and milk
intakemaycontinuesupportstheneedtocontinuemonitoringthe
serum 25(OH)D status of the population.
