Abstract
Objective: To evaluate levels of the calcium-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9 in the skin of
patients with psoriatic arthritis.
Methods: Skin punch biopsies were obtained from patients with psoriatic arthritis and healthy
control subjects. S100A8/A9 were semiquantified via immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative
polymerase chain reaction.
Results: The study included biopsies from nine patients with psoriatic arthritis and nine control
subjects. S100A8 and S100A9 were present at visibly higher levels in psoriatic plaques compared
with normal skin samples. S100A8 and S100A9 RNA levels were significantly higher in the
peripheral region of plaques compared with the central region.
Conclusion: Both S100A8 and S100A9 may represent good therapeutic targets in psoriasis and
psoriatic arthritis.

Introduction
Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory
disease characterized by an association
between psoriatic skin lesions and arthritis.
Striking features of the synovium in psoriatic
arthritis are the marked tortuosity of blood
vessels at the macroscopic level, and plasma
cell and mononuclear cell infiltration.1 These
histological findings are associated with

monocyte-derived cytokines, which are
important mediators in synovitis.2
Myeloid-related protein 8 (MRP8;
S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9) are cal-
cium-binding proteins belonging to the S100
protein family. They are involved in both
intracellular functions (cell differentiation
and cell-cycle progression, regulation of
kinase activities and cytoskeleton­membrane
interactions) and extracellular functions
(neutrophil extension, chemoattraction and
induction of adhesion molecule expression).3
Elevated S100A8 and S100A9 levels are
found in fluid samples from inflamed tissues
in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arth-
ritis, strengthening the hypothesis that these
molecules are important inflammatory fac-
tors.4 The gene-expression profile of psoriatic
arthritis includes increased expression of
genes involved in downregulation or suppres-
sion of innate and acquired immune
responses, such as S100A8.5 In addition, a
mouse model of psoriasis that targeted dele-
tion of jun-b and c-jun in keratinocytes
resulted in a psoriasiform phenotype, with
both erosive inflammatory arthritis and peri-
ostitis, reminiscent of human psoriatic arth-
ritis. In this model, epidermal expression of
S100A8/A9 was significantly increased in
prediseased skin,6 suggesting that a selective
defect of keratinocytes could induce an
immune reaction that leads to the psoriatic
phenotype and also to erosive arthritis.
The aim of our study was to evaluate the
presence of S100A8/A9 in skin samples from
patients with psoriatic arthritis.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited patients with untreated
psoriatic arthritis attending the combined
outpatient unit of Dermatology and
Rheumatology, University of Rome ``Tor
Vergata'', Rome, Italy, between January
2012 and February 2013. Age- and sex-
matched healthy control subjects were
recruited through advertisements placed by
the University of Rome ``Tor Vergata'',
Rome, Italy.
All patients and control subjects provided
written informed consent prior to enrol-
ment. The study was approved by the local
ethics committee of the University of Rome
``Tor Vergata'', Rome, Italy.
Immunohistochemistry
Skin punch biopsies were obtained from
healthy controls (two samples per subject),
and from the centre and periphery of
psoriatic lesions from patients. From each
donor, one sample was snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen for RNA extraction and the other
was fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution
(pH, 5.5) at 4C overnight, processed and
embedded in paraffin wax. After deparaffi-
nizing and rehydration, 5 mm-thick skin sec-
tions were incubated at 80C overnight in
citrate buffer (pH 6.0), incubated with 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, then incu-
bated with SuperBlockTM (ScyTek, Logan,
UT, USA) for 5 min. Sections were then
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
polyclonal rabbit anti-human S100A8 (HPA
024372; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO USA),
polyclonal rabbit anti-human S100A9 (OPA
004193 Sigma Aldrich; both at 2 mg/ml in
antibody diluent with background reducing
components [S3022; Dako, Carpinteria, CA
USA]), or rabbit immunoglobulin G, poly-
clonal isotype control (ab 27472; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA USA). Slides were washed
three times with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS; pH, 7.4), then incubated with Dako
REAL Detection system (Dako) according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Staining intensity was semiquantified
using digital image analysis. Briefly, stained
tissue sections were viewed under a light
microscope. Digital images were amplified
to 1280 Â 960 pixels, rasterized and three

fields per section were analysed using
ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; available at:
http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
RT­PCR
For semiquantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), total RNA was extracted
from snap-frozen skin samples using TRIzolÕ
(Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Total RNA (1mg) was reverse
transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and
MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied
Biosystems Italy, Milan, Italy). The resulting
cDNA was used in PCR analysis with
AmpliTaqTM Gold 360 DNA polymerase
(Applied Biosystems) and an iCyclerÕ ther-
mal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA USA).
Primer sequences were: S100A8 forward
primer, 50-ATTTCCATGCCGTCTACAG
G-30 and reverse primer, 50-TGGCTTTCT
TCATGGCTTTT-30; S100A9 forward
primer, 50-CAGCTGGAACGCAACATAG
A-30 and reverse primer, 50-CCACAG
CCAAGACAGTTTGA-30: glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; inter-
nal control) forward primer, 50-ACCACAG
TCCATGCCATCAC-30 and reverse primer,
50-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCT -30. PCR
cycling conditions were an initial denatur-
ation step at 95C for 5 min, followed by 30
cycles of denaturation at 94C for 45s,
annealing at 55C for 45s, elongation at
72C for 45s, and a final extension step at
72C for 10min.
The PCR products were separated on
1.5% agarose gels and visualized using
ethidium bromide staining and UV light
with UV trasilluminator 2000, (Biorad
Hercules, CA, USA). Images were acquired
using Gel Logic 100 imaging system
(KodakÕ, Rochester, NY, USA), and opti-
cal density was calculated and expressed
relative to GAPDH.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD and
analysed using Pearson's parametric test
for univariate analysis. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSSÕ version
10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ; P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
The study included skin biopsies from nine
patients with psoriatic arthritis (5 male/4
female; mean age 48.7 Æ 12.8 years; age
range 20­62 years; mean disease duration
6.5 Æ 3.8 years; mean disease activity score
[DAS]44 4.6 Æ 1.2; mean psoriasis area
severity index score7 7.6 Æ 1.5) and nine
healthy control subjects (6 male/3 female;
mean age 41.3 Æ 11.6 years; age range 30­55
years).
Levels of S100A8 staining were visibly
higher in psoriasis plaques compared with
normal skin samples (Figure 1), with stain-
ing being concentrated in the nucleus.
Similar results were obtained for S100A9
(data not shown). Levels of S100A8 and
S100A9 RNA were significantly higher in
patients than in controls (S100A8, 10.6 Æ 7.5
vs 6.9 Æ 5.1, P < 0.01; S100A9, 2.7 Æ 1.7 vs
1.0 Æ 0.5, P < 0.01).
Levels of S100A8 and S100A9 RNA were
significantly higher in the peripheral region of
plaques compared with the central region
(peripheral S100A8 10.69.8 vs central S100A8
2.9 Æ 1.9, P < 0.01; peripheral S100A9
10.5 Æ 9.1 vs central S100A9 5.1 Æ 4.1,
P < 0.01).
Discussion
Clinical and experimental observations
have indicated that monocyte­macrophage
mediated inflammation is a key factor in
stimulating keratinocyte and synoviocyte

hyperproliferation.4 Inflammatory cyto-
kines such as tumour necrosis factor-a are
overexpressed in psoriatic synovium and
plaques.8 The strong nuclear staining for
S100A8/A9 seen in the present study is
consistent with the idea that these proteins
are involved in psoriasis plaque initiation
and amplification through their direct bind-
ing and transcriptional activation of genes
of the complement system.9 Our finding that
levels of S100A8/A9 are higher at the per-
iphery than the centre of psoriatic lesions
confirms the active role of these proteins as
inflammation amplifiers. It is likely that
S100A8/A9 act by orchestrating the recruit-
ment of inflammatory cells and the expan-
sion of the psoriatic plaque via secreted
cytokines. S100A8 and S100A9 may repre-
sent good therapeutic targets in psoriasis
and psoriatic arthritis.
