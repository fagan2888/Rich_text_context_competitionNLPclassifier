Abstract
Purpose of the Study: Despite the increasing number of older adults who have a history of substance use, little research has
been done on alcohol- and drug-related driving safety among older drivers. This study (a) examined risk factors for older
adults' driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs (DUI) and (b) discerned differences between those aged 50­64
and those aged 65+.
Design and Methods: Data came from the public use files of the 2008­2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health for
respondents aged 50+ (N = 29,634). Descriptive statistics were used to present sample characteristics by past year substance
use and self-reported DUI status for age groups 50­64 and 65+. Age group separate binary logistic regression analysis was
used to identify risk factors for DUI.
Results: Of past-year substance users in the 50­64 and the 65+ age groups, 14.54% and 6.19%, respectively, self-
reported DUI. Higher frequency alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana use, and major depressive episode significantly
increased the odds of DUI in both age groups. Lifetime arrest history was a predictor in the 65+ age group only.
Implications: Research is needed to improve identification of older drivers at high risk of DUI. Driving safety assessments
for older adults can incorporate screening for substance abuse and comorbid mental conditions to identify those at high
DUI risk. Older adults who engage in risky substance use should be directed to appropriate services that address substance
use and mental health problems concurrently.
Key Words: Substance abuse, Driving under the influence, Alcohol expectancy, Psychosocial vulnerability
With the rapid growth of the population aged 65 and older,
the number of older adult drivers is projected to double
by 2030 from the 2009 figure of 33 million or 15.6% of
all licensed drivers (United States Census Bureau, 2012).
Although older drivers tend to have the lowest accident rate
(4 per 100 drivers) of all age groups, they have one of the
highest motor vehicle crash rates per vehicle mile of travel,
and older drivers involved in crashes also tended to have
more serious injuries requiring more health care resources
than younger drivers (Lotfipour, Cisneros, & Chakravarty,
2013). The fatal injury risk from crashes also significantly
increases in the 70+ group (Sifrit, Stutts, Martell, & Staplin,
2011). In 2009 alone, almost 1.4 million adults aged 65 or
older had motor vehicle accidents, and 3,500 of the 65­74
group and 3,800 of the 75+ group were killed in crashes
(United States Census Bureau, 2012).
Studies of driving safety among older adults have
focused primarily on age-related declines in cognitive,
functional, and visual capacities (Awadzi, Classen, Hall,
Duncan, & Garvan, 2008; Thomas, Blomberg, Knodler,
Mathew, & Romoser, 2013). Few have considered one of
the major sources of preventable accidents--driving under
the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Alcohol and/or other
drug involvement in crashes is less prevalent among older
adults than among younger adults (Fell, Tippetts, & Voas,
2009). In 2012, drivers aged 65+ were 4.4% of all drivers
involved in fatal crashes who had a blood alcohol concen-
tration (BAC)  0.08
g/dl; the proportion of drugged older
drivers is estimated to be even lower (National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, 2013). However, studies have
shown an increasing rate of substance use disorders among
older adults, partly owing to aging baby boomers who are
more likely to have a history of substance use and related
problems than earlier cohorts (Blazer & Wu, 2009). A study
based on the 2005 and 2006 National Survey of Drug Use
and Health (NSDUH) found that 36.4% of those aged 65+
and 44.7% of those aged 50­64 used alcohol without abuse
or dependence symptoms, but 6.7% of those aged 65+ and
11.2% of those aged 50­64 showed dependence, abuse, or
subthreshold dependence symptoms (Blazer & Wu, 2011).
A study based on data from the 2005­2008 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey also found that 14.5%
of drinkers aged 65+ consumed alcohol above the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's recommended
limits (Wilson,Knowles,Huang,& Fink,2014).When health
status was taken into account, 37.4% had engaged in harm-
ful consumption (i.e., exacerbating or complicating existing
health problems) and 15.9% had engaged in hazardous con-
sumption (i.e., drinking that posed risks of future harm).
Data from the 2007­2009 NSDUH also show that
9.0% of those aged 50­59 and 2.3% of those aged 60+
used illicit drugs (marijuana being the most common sub-
stance--5.9% of the 50­59 group and 1.1% of the 60+
group) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration [SAMHSA], 2011). Illicit drug abuse treat-
ment admissions among those 55 years and older have
also been increasing. SAMHSA's Treatment Episode Data
Set (a compilation of descriptive data on the national flow
of admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment pro-
viders) for 1998­2008 showed a steady and substantial
increase in admissions of those aged 55+ for a primary
problem of illicit drug use (marijuana, cocaine, heroin,
phencyclidine, hallucinogens, and methamphetamine),
whereas alcohol use as the primary substance decreased
slightly (Arndt, Clayton, & Schultz, 2011). Illicit drug use
is much more common in the 50­59 age group than in the
60+ age group, but the prevalence may rise substantially
in the 65+ age group as the younger cohort ages (Blazer &
Wu, 2009; Han, Gfroerer, Colliver, & Penne, 2009).
Older adults tend to restrict or stop driving when physi-
cal, cognitive, and/or vision impairments begin to affect
their driving abilities (Baldock, Mathias, McLean, & Berndt,
2006; Kostyniuk & Molnar, 2008; Stiffler & Wilber, 2013).
However, older adults tend to overrate their driving abili-
ties (Freund, Colgrove, Burke, & McLeod, 2005; Okonkwo,
Crowe, Wadley, & Ball, 2008; Ross, Dodson, Edwards,
Ackerman, & Ball, 2012). Alcohol and drug use may con-
tribute to older drivers' overrating tendency because these
substances affect cognitive functioning, especially reasoning
and decision-making abilities, despite the fact that these sub-
stances negatively affect motor coordination and reaction
times,concentration and memory,vision and ability to follow
objects with eyes, and discrimination between light inten-
sity and sound that are requisite for safe driving (Mitchell,
1985). Although drinking quantity tends to decline with age,
alcohol-induced neurotoxicity in late life is a significant con-
cern even with moderate alcohol consumption (Kapogiannis
et al., 2012). Aging- and disease-related physiological
changes (e.g., smaller body mass and lower water content)
lead to higher and longer-lasting BACs in older adults than
in younger adults (Ferreira & Weems, 2008). Older adults
who take multiple prescription and nonprescription medica-
tions are also at higher risk for dangerous interaction effects
of these medications with alcohol and/or illicit drugs.
For older adults, driving is not just a means of getting
from one location to another but an essential tool for
remaining mobile, socially integrated, and independent
(Curl, Stowe, Cooney, & Proulx, 2014; Mezuk & Rebok,
2008; Oxley, 2008). Preserving older adults' mobility by
prolonging their safe driving capacities and providing
alternative transportation for those who can no longer
drive is a necessity for successful aging. Older driver safety
involves both vehicle/roadway characteristics and driver
health/medical conditions (Staplin & Freund, 2013; Stutts,
Martell, & Staplin, 2009). Increases in the number of
older drivers combined with increases in the prevalence of
substance use among older adults indicate that concerns
should extend beyond those typically associated with older
adult drivers' health and safety (e.g., physical/functional,
cognitive, and sensory impairments) to include substance
use. Despite a projected upward trajectory in the num-
ber and proportion of older adults who drive under the
influence of alcohol and/or drugs (DUI), DUI among older
adults has received little research attention compared with
DUI among adolescents and young and middle-aged adults.
Using multiyear survey data from nationally representative
samples, the present study (a) examined DUI risk factors
among older adults, focusing on their substance use pat-
terns and psychosocial vulnerabilities and (b) discerned
differences between those aged 50­64 and those aged 65+.
Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses
Driving under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs
may be explained using alcohol (or drug) expectancy theory,
psychosocial vulnerability, and poor decision-making ten-
dencies. According to expectancy theory, people engage in
certain behaviors because they expect particular outcomes
(reinforcing effects) as a result of engaging in the behavior.
Those with more positive alcohol outcome expectations
(e.g., social and physical pleasure, relaxation, coping, and
assertiveness) are therefore likely to drink more (Devine &
Rosenberg, 2000; Jones, Corbin, & Fromme, 2001; Oei &
Baldwin,1994).Schell,Chan,and Morral (2006) also found
The Gerontologist, 2016, Vol. 56, No. 2 283
that those with more positive alcohol expectancies tended
to persist in driving after drinking. However, not all adults
who drink at problem levels drive under the influence or
engage in other hazardous behaviors. Sadava (1985) found
a weak-to-moderate correlation between self-reported
alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems, show-
ing that heavy alcohol use is a necessary but not sufficient
condition for problem behaviors. In addition to frequency
and quantity of alcohol consumption, other drug involve-
ment and psychosocial vulnerability (e.g., work-related and
life-change stress and emotional problems) contributed sig-
nificantly to alcohol-related problem behaviors (Sadava).
Studies have found that older adults drink for the same
reasons as younger adults--to enhance positive mood or
well-being, obtain social rewards (e.g., celebrate special
occasions with family and friends), cope with and attenu-
ate negative emotions (e.g., to forget worries and improve
depressed or anxious mood), or for medicinal purposes
(Gilson et al., 2013; Immonen, Valvanne, & Pitkälä, 2011).
Gilson and colleagues found that enhancement motives
(but not social and coping motives) were associated with
drinking quantity and that coping motives had strong direct
associations with drinking problems. Others (Devanand,
2002; Satre, Sterling, Mackin, & Weisner, 2011) have
found significant associations between late-life depression
and alcohol/drug use. In addition to emotional distress,
previous research has shown that poor decision-making
tendencies, as indicated by other legal transgressions and
other forms of irresponsibility rooted in impulsivity and
lack of self-control, may also contribute to DUI (Cavaiola,
Strohmetz, & Abreo, 2007; Keane, Maxim, & Teevan,
1993). However, it remains unknown if psychosocial vul-
nerability (e.g., depression) and poor decision-making ten-
dencies are associated with DUI in older adults.
Based on expectancy theory and the perspective that psy-
chosocial vulnerability and poor decision-making tendencies
contribute to alcohol (or drug)-related problem behaviors, we
tested the following hypotheses: The likelihood of DUI among
older adults will be positively associated with (H1) quantity
and frequency of alcohol consumption, (H2) use of any illicit
drug, (H3) depression (an indicator of psychosocial vulner-
ability), and (H4) any arrest history (an indicator of poor
decision-making tendencies). Potential differences between
those aged 50­64 and aged 65+ in DUI risk factors were also
examined. Although age and gender differences in substance
use and DUI have been well established (Maxwell & Freeman,
2007; SAMHSA, 2011), associations between DUI and health
status are less well established. Given the scant previous
research on DUI in older adults, we also examined sociode-
mographic and health correlates of DUI in both age groups.
Design and Methods
Data and Sample
Data for this study came from the public use files of the
2008­2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
The annual NSDUH series primarily measures the preva-
lence and correlates of drug use and health status of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged 12
or older (Inter-university Consortium for Political and
Social Research [ICPSR], 2012a). The survey covers sub-
stance abuse, treatment history, illegal activities, and arrest
record and included questions from the fourth edition of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV) that were asked of respondents aged 18 and older.
Survey respondents were selected based on multistage area
probability sampling methods designed to ensure their rep-
resentativeness and uniqueness (i.e., nonduplication from
year to year). Respondents were interviewed in private at
their place of residence using a combination of methods
(audio computer-assisted self-interview, computer-assisted
personal interview, and computer-assisted self-interview) to
increase the validity of reports of substance use and illegal
activity (ICPSR, 2012a).
To increase the study's power to detect low frequency
events (e.g., DUI arrest), we combined 5 years of the de-
identified, public-domain survey data. The data collection
methods for the variables examined in this study were the
same for all five survey years. The total number of respond-
ents who completed the survey was 55,739 in 2008, 55,772
in 2009, 57,873 in 2010, 58,397 in 2011, and 55,268 in
2012. The number of respondents in the 50­64 age group
was 3,317 in 2008, 3,461 in 2009, 3,523 in 2010, 4,219
in 2011, and 3,923 in 2012. The number of respondents
in the 65+ age group was 2,008 in 2008, 2,015 in 2009,
2,144 in 2010, 2,486 in 2011, and 2,448 in 2012. This
study focused on the 29,634 respondents aged 50+ from
2008 to 2012: 18,443 were 50­64 years of age and 11,191
were 65+ years of age.
Measures
DUI in the Past 12 Months
The NSUDH included four DUI-related questions: (a)
"During the past 12 months, have you driven a vehicle
while you were under the influence of a combination of
alcohol and illegal drugs used together?" (b) "During the
past 12 months, have you driven a vehicle while you were
under the influence of alcohol/alcohol only?" (c) "During
the past 12 months, have you driven a vehicle while you
were under the influence of illegal drugs/illegal drugs
only?" and (d) "In the past 12 months, were you arrested
and booked for driving under the influence of alcohol or
drugs?" (ICPSR, 2012b). An affirmative response to any of
the earlier questions was considered DUI (1 = yes, 0 = no).
Alcohol Use in Past 12 Months
This was defined as consuming at least one drink of any type
of alcoholic beverage (described as a can or bottle of beer, a
glass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of liquor, or a mixed
drink with liquor) and excluded the use of only a sip or two
from a drink (ICPSR, 2012b). Frequency of alcohol use:
The Gerontologist, 2016, Vol. 56, No. 2
284
Alcohol users reported the total number of days they used
alcohol in the past 12 months (1­11, 12­49, 50­99, 100­299,
and 300­365 days). Binge alcohol use was defined as drink-
ing 5 drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or
within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in
the past 30 days. Heavy alcohol use was defined as drinking
5 drinks on the same occasion on each of five or more days
in the past 30 days; all heavy alcohol users are, therefore, also
binge alcohol users. DSM-IV diagnoses of alcohol dependence
and abuse are also presented to describe the sample. Alcohol
dependence and abuse were determined only if respondents
reported alcohol use on more than 5 days in the past year.
Illicit Drug Use in Past 12 Months
This included "marijuana use" (1 = yes, 0 = no) and "illicit
drug use other than marijuana" (1 = yes, 0 = no). Because
of the small proportion of illicit drug users, frequency of
use was not considered, but DSM-IV diagnoses of illicit
drug dependence and abuse were presented to describe the
sample. Marijuana dependence and abuse were determined
only if respondents reported use on more than 5 days in the
past year, but the diagnostic criteria for other illicit drugs
applied regardless of days of use.
Psychosocial Vulnerabilities in Past 12 Months
This was represented by major depressive episode (MDE) in
the past year that met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (yes = 1,
no = 0).To describe the sample, we also present worst month
serious psychological distress (SPD), which was measured
with the six-item, 4-point Kessler Psychological Distress
Scale (K6; 0 = none of the time to 4 = all of the time; Kessler
et al., 2003). NSDUH respondents were asked how fre-
quently during the past 30 days they experienced "feeling
nervous; feeling hopeless; feeling restless or fidgety; feeling
so sad or depressed that nothing could cheer you up; feeling
that everything was an effort; and feeling down on yourself,
no good, or worthless."A summed score of 13 or higher was
considered as having had SPD in the past year. Cronbach's
alpha for the K6 among the study sample was 0.91. Of those
aged 50­64, 53.76% of those with SPD also had MDE and
29.47% of those 65+ years who had SPD also had MDE.
Poor Decision-Making Tendencies
This was measured by lifetime arrest history. Respondents
were asked whether or not they had ever been arrested/booked
for "breaking the law" in their lifetime (yes = 1, no = 0).
Sociodemographic and Health Status
Sociodemographic factors included age group (individual
chronological age is not available in the public use data
sets), gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, and
income. Health status variables included self-ratings of
health (on a 5-point scale; 1 = excellent and 5 = poor) and
the number of diagnosed chronic illnesses (asthma, cir-
rhosis of liver, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease,
stroke, lung cancer, and pancreatitis).
Analysis
All analyses were conducted with Stata/MP 13's svy function
to take into account NSDUH's multistage, stratified sam-
pling design. For the 5-year pooled data set for this study,
adjusted person-level analysis weights were created by divid-
ing the final person-level analysis weights by the number of
years of combined data (five in the current study) following
NSDUH guidelines for combining sampling weights across
multiple survey years. All estimates presented in this study
are weighted except for sample sizes. Descriptive statistics, t
tests, and 2 tests were used to present sample characteristics
by past-year alcohol and/or illicit drug use and DUI status
by age group (50­64 and 65+). Age group separate binary
logistic regression analysis, with DUI status as the depend-
ent variable, was used to test study hypotheses among those
who reported past-year alcohol and/or illicit drug use and to
identify DUI risk factors in each age group.
Results
Sample Characteristics by Past-Year
Substance Use
Table 1 shows that 69.56% of the 50­64 age group and
52.19% of the 65+ age group used alcohol and/or illicit
drugs in the preceding 12 months. In both age groups,
more than 98% of users of any substance used alcohol,
whereas 12.47% of the 50­64 age group and 3.30% of
the 65+ age group used illicit drugs. For both age groups,
compared with nonusers, substance users had higher pro-
portions of men, non-Hispanic whites, married persons,
college graduates, employed persons, and those with
income at or above 200% of federal poverty guidelines.
Substance users also reported better self-ratings of health
and fewer chronic illnesses and included a smaller propor-
tion of those who experienced SPD. For the 50­64 age
group, substance users also included a smaller propor-
tion of those with MDE. However, for the 65+ age group,
there was no difference between users and nonusers in
MDE rates.
Table 2 shows that 14.54% and 6.19% of substance users
in the 50­64 age group and the 65+ age group, respectively,
self-reported DUI in the preceding 12 months, but only a
tiny proportion reported having been arrested/booked for
DUI. As expected, a majority of those reporting DUI drove
under the influence of alcohol rather than other drugs.
Sample Characteristics by Past-Year DUI Status
Among Substance Users
Table 3 shows that for both age groups, those reporting
DUI, compared with those who did not, were more likely
to be men, college graduates, employed, had income at or
above 200% of federal poverty guidelines, and reported
better self-ratings of health and fewer chronic illnesses. In
the 50­64 age group, DUI reporters were also more likely
to be non-Hispanic white, but the racial/ethnic distribution
The Gerontologist, 2016, Vol. 56, No. 2 285
in the 65+ age group did not differ significantly by DUI
status. DUI reporters aged 65+ were also more likely to be
married than those not reporting DUI, but DUI reporters
aged 50­64 were less likely to be married.
As expected, those who reported DUI, compared with
those who did not, used alcohol more frequently and in
larger quantities. Of DUI reporters, 20.38% aged 50­64
and 34.78% aged 65+ reported consuming alcohol on
300+ days in the preceding 12 months. Nearly 20% of DUI
reporters in both age groups reported heavy drinking in
the preceding 30 days and 33.89% of DUI reporters aged
50­64 and 27.73% aged 65+ reported binge, although not
heavy drinking, in the preceding 30 days. Nearly 25% of
DUI reporters, compared with 3% of nonreporters, aged
50­64 and more than 21% of DUI reporters, compared
with 2% of nonreporters, aged 65+ met DSM-IV diagnos-
tic criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse.
Of DUI reporters, 28.95% in the 50­64 age group and
9.96% in the 65+ age group reported any illicit drug use,
with 22.14% and 8.18%, respectively, reporting mari-
juana use. Nearly 4% of DUI reporters, compared with
less than 1% of nonreporters, in the 50­64 age group,

the abuse diagnosis alone was not statistically different
between DUI reporters and nonreporters in the 65+ age

that higher proportions of DUI reporters than nonreport-
ers in both age groups reported having received substance

0.27% in the 65+ age group, 2(1) = 228.40, p = .039). Of
DUI reporters, 25.36% aged 50­64 and 22.32% aged 65+
reported that they needed treatment but did not receive it
during the preceding year.
As also shown in Table 3, a higher proportion of DUI
reporters than nonreporters in both age groups expe-
rienced MDE. Although a higher proportion of DUI
reporters than nonreporters in the 50­64 age group
experienced SPD, the difference was not statistically
significant in the 65+ age group. A significantly higher
proportion of DUI reporters than nonreporters in both
age groups had been arrested/booked for breaking the
law in their lifetimes. Further analysis also found that
a higher proportion of DUI reporters than nonreporters
in both age groups reported that they received mental
health treatment in the preceding 12 months (19.93% vs.
15.48% in the 50­64 age group, 2(1) = 515.29, p < .001;
15.96% vs. 9.63% in the 65+ age group, 2(1) = 730.84,

DUI Risk Factors Among Substance Users:
Multivariate Analysis Results
Table 4 shows that controlling for demographic and health
status, both frequency and quantity of alcohol use were sig-
nificant predictors of DUI in both age groups. For example,
in both age groups, compared with those who consumed
alcohol on fewer than 50 days, those who did so on 300
or more days had nearly fivefold greater odds of report-
ing DUI (odds ratio [OR] = 4.97, 95% confidence interval
[95% CI] = 3.76­6.57, p < .001 for the 50­64 age group;
OR = 4.72, 95% CI = 2.98­7.50, p < .001 for the 65+ age
group). Compared with nonbinge drinkers, binge drinkers
had significantly higher odds of DUI reports (OR = 2.52,
95% CI = 2.18­2.91, p < .001 for the 50­64 age group;
OR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.27­4.58, p < .001 for the 65+ age
group). Marijuana use was also a significant predictor of
DUI reports in both age groups (OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.54­
3.820, p < .001 for the 50­64 age group; OR = 4.94, 95%
CI = 2.12­11.52, p < .001 for the 65+ age group). Other
illicit drug use was a significant predictor in the younger,
but not the older, age group. MDE was a significant pre-
dictor for both age groups (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.64­
2.57, p < .001 for the 50­64 age group; OR = 4.20, 95%
CI = 1.83­9.63, p = .001 for the 65+ age group). Lifetime
arrest history did not predict DUI in the younger age
group, but it did in the 65+ age group (OR = 2.32, 95%
CI = 1.58­3.42, p < .001). Of the demographic variables,
being male and having income at or above 200% of federal
poverty guidelines significantly increased the odds of DUI
reports for both age groups. In addition, higher education
in the 65+ age group and being non-Hispanic white and
being employed in the 50­64 age group increased the odds,
whereas being married decreased the odds in the 50­64 age
group. The health status variables significantly predicted
DUI in the 50­64 age group only, with better health being
associated with greater odds of DUI reports.
Discussion
Older adults have increased susceptibility to the effects of
alcohol and drugs and higher fatal injury risks from motor
vehicle crashes. In the face of increasing rates of substance
use among older adults, this study examined DUI risk
factors among the growing older population. The higher
rates of substance use, particularly illicit drug use, among
50­64 year olds compared with those aged 65+ indicate
that substance use among older adults is likely to continue
to increase as those in the younger age group (baby boom-
ers) swell the ranks of older adults. The findings show that
substance users tend to be better off economically and
are healthier than nonusers. Those with limited financial
resources and very poor health may be less likely to drink
alcohol or use drugs due to inability to obtain these sub-
stances or because they recognize that these behaviors are
detrimental to their health. The self-reported DUI rate of
6.19% among substance users in the 65+ age group was
significantly lower than 14.54% in the 50­64 age group.
However, the DUI rate in the 65+ age group may actually
be higher if those who never drove or stopped driving due
to age- and disease-related disabilities had been excluded
(NSDUH does not include this information). Even a 6%
DUI rate is alarming given older adults' higher motor vehi-
cle crash rates per vehicle mile of travel and higher fatal
injury risks from these crashes. As DUI offenders are at risk
for committing subsequent offenses (Cavaiola et al., 2007),
older adults who continue to drive under the influence pose
a substantial safety concern.
The findings also provide support for alcohol expectancy
theory, psychosocial vulnerability, and poor decision-mak-
ing tendencies in predicting DUI risks. Higher frequency
alcohol use, binge drinking, and marijuana use significantly
increased the odds of self-reported DUI in both age groups.
These findings indicate that substance use patterns among
older DUI reporters do not differ from those of younger
age groups for whom binge drinking has consistently been
found to significantly predict DUI and DUI recidivism
(Brady & Li, 2013; Maxwell, 2011; Romano & Voas,
2011). These studies also found that following alcohol,
marijuana/cannabinoids is the second most prevalent sub-
stance found in fatally injured drivers, and significant alco-
hol­drug and drug­drug interactions among polysubstance
users were also observed. Our findings also show that DUI
reporters were more likely to have a history of substance
abuse and encounters with law enforcement. Higher rates
of MDE and SPD among the DUI reporters also indicate
that this group suffers from substantial emotional dis-
tress (i.e., co-occurring mental disorders) that should be
addressed in combination with substance use and abuse.
The findings for both age groups regarding DUI soci-
odemographic risk factors (being male, non-Hispanic

white, employed, and having higher education/income)
and health-status risk factors (better or similar self-rat-
ings of health and chronic illnesses) are also worth not-
ing. Older drivers tend to have higher socioeconomic and
physical, functional, and cognitive health statuses than
former drivers, as health deterioration is associated with
driving cessation (O'Connor, Edwards, Waters, Hudak,
& Valdés, 2013). Although DUI-reporting older adults
appear to be more advantaged socioeconomically and
more or similarly advantaged in health statuses as their
age peers who did not report DUI, their mental health
status is worse. Continued heavy drinking and illicit drug
use combined with psychological distress may also por-
tend worse health and mental outcomes for these older
adults.
The study has a few limitations: (a) The reliability and
validity of respondents' self-report of DUI was not ascer-
tained, and underreporting due to recall or social desirabil-
ity bias is a concern. (b) Respondents' driving status was not
available; some nonreporters may not have driven during
the survey period. (c) Despite the 5-year pooled data, the
small number of older adults reporting DUI hampered more
in-depth analysis (e.g., polysubstance use as a risk factor).
Despite its limitations, this study suggests the follow-
ing policy and practice implications for promoting driving
safety by preventing and reducing DUI among the growing
number of older drivers: (a) Health and social service pro-
viders can educate older, substance-using drivers about age-
related changes that affect substance use effects in general
and driving safety in particular and motivate those in need
to seek treatment. (b) Access to evidence-based treatment
needs to be facilitated for older substance abusers in gen-
eral and DUI reporters in particular, given that approxi-
mately one quarter of older DUI reporters perceived the
need for treatment but did not receive it. (c) Addressing the
emotional distress many DUI reporters experience may also
reduce substance use and promote driving safety.
This study also underscores the need for continued
research to improve identification of older drivers at high
risk of DUI and identify effective intervention approaches.
These approaches should take into account older drivers'
characteristics, behaviors, and expectations in order to pre-
vent crash and injury while also prolonging their mobility.
Suggested steps are as follows: (a) Test improved protocols
for assessing older adults' driving safety by screening for
substance abuse and comorbid mental health conditions in
addition to assessing motor, visuoperceptual, and cogni-
tive functioning. (b) Expand research on nonmedical use
of prescription and over-the-counter psychoactive medica-
tions and use of multiple medications that may affect older
adults' driving safety and DUI. (c) Focus on intelligent
transportation system technology that holds promise for
maintaining and enhancing safe mobility of older adults
(Dickerson et al., 2007). Advanced technology should not
just help older adults drive safely but also prevent them
from driving when it is not safe, for example, by providing
a tool that older adults can easily use to self-screen their
substance-impaired driving limitations.
