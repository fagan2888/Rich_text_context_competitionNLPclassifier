Introduction
Assessing the well-being of postpartum mothers is viewed as
an important aspect of postnatal care, especially, if long-term
negative mother­infant dyad outcomes are to be avoided
(Ayers & Ford, 2009; Broomfield, Lamont, Parker, &
Horsfall, 2010; Herrman et al., 2011; Milne, Greenway, &
Hansen, 2007). Hence, the role of the Child Health Nurse
(CHN) is to work directly with mothers during the 36 post-
partum period to identify mothers who are, and mothers who
are not coping with motherhood (Beyondblue, 2011).
In terms of providing assistance to mothers during this
critical postnatal recovery period, CHNs generally try to visit
mothers within as soon as feasible after the infant's birth.
During the course of this visit and subsequent home/clinic
visits, the CHN conducts an assessment of the mothers'resil-
ience as well as identifies any situational protective/at-risk
factors that may positively/negatively influence the well-
being of the mother and child (Collins, 2011).This assess-
ment involves screening for postnatal depression, identifying
situational problems, developing individualized visitation
schedules, and assisting mothers with their postpartum
recovery (Beyondblue, 2011; Department of Health Western
Australia, 2006).
Although the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
(EPDS) is a widely recommended postnatal depression
screening device, it is unclear what other measures CHNs are
advised to use when assessing maternal resilience. For
instance, the Western Australian CHN practice guidelines
refer to An Indicators of Need guide as being an appropriate
assessment tool; however, no clear indication is given as to
how it can be sourced (Collins, 2011). Consequently, the
accessing of this tool is dependent on each nurse's time,
motivation, and determination to source the relevant infor-
mation. This individualized assessment situation approach
contributes to the variation in service delivery practices that
many health authorities seek to eradicate.
A further conundrum is that if CHNs are to be proficient
at identifying postpartum resilience, then they need to have
both a conceptual understanding of resilience and a practice
understanding of how to recognize and evaluate it. This
understanding is important not only in terms of their ability
to assess maternal resilience, but also in identifying other
significant adverse/challenging events that are occurring
within the family unit during the postnatal period. Thus, this

Their Heads Above Water":
Western Australian Child Health
Nurses' Understanding of Resilience
in Postpartum Mothers
Rachael Collins1, Julie Ann Pooley1, and Myra F. Taylor1
Abstract
Assessing the well-being of postpartum mothers is an important aspect of postnatal nursing care. For this reason, Child
Health Nurses (CHNs) are charged with the responsibility of identifying postpartum mothers who do/not manifest resilient
behavioral qualities. However, little is known about CHNs' conceptualization of resilience or how they assess resilience in
postpartum mothers. This exemplar study addressed this knowledge shortfall by conducting semi-structured interviews with
eight practicing CHNs. The study's findings reveal that although CHNs' conceptual understanding of resilience is congruent
with current theoretical thinking, some variance does exist in the ways in which CHNs assess postpartum resilience,
particularly, in relation to CHNs' use of intuitive assessment techniques to appraise the critical maternal postpartum coping
qualities of adaptation, responsiveness, self-confidence, and social connectedness.

existing approach is somewhat limited by each CHN's train-
ing and years of experience (Marron & Maginnis, 2009).
An Understanding of Resilience
Understandably, calls have been made for research that pro-
vides a greater understanding of the concept of resilience,
how it is made manifest, and how nurses can recognize it in
others (Gillespie, Chaboyer, & Wallis, 2009). The need to
investigate CHNs' present understanding of the conceptual
underpinnings of resilience (and its counterpart thriving)
arises because the definitions of these two constructs have
undergone considerable revision since their inception. In the
case of resilience, it has changed from its original deficit
model of being a "resistance to stress" (Garmezy, Masten, &
Tellegen, 1984). Indeed, over the last decade, a seismic shift
has occurred within the resilience paradigm that has moved
it away from its former deficit conceptualization toward the
current strength-based model. In this regard, a definitional
debate opened around whether resilience could be conceptu-
alized as a state of homeostatic health maintenance during
which competent thriving individuals return to their pre-
adversity condition following each new adversity experience
(O'Leary & Ickovics, 1995). This suggestion gave rise to the
notion of resilience being a "better-off-afterwards" experi-
ence, which in turn became the catalyst for shifting the
research focus towards determining what innate intraper-
sonal (e.g., social skills) and cognitive competencies (e.g.,
intelligence, creativity, humor) were common to resilient
individuals (Tusaie & Dyer, 2004). During the same period,
other researchers focused on determining the stress-resilient
personality traits that allow individuals when faced with
infrequent severe instances of personal threat to not only
cope, but also to so successfully adapt that they are able to
regain (and maintain) their pre-adversity level of functioning
(Wald, Taylor, & Asmundson, 2006). It was conceptualiza-
tions of this nature that gave rise to the "bounce-back" notion
of resilience (Darbyshire & Jackson, 2005; Herrman et al.,
2011; Luthar, Cicchetti, & Becker, 2000).
Following on from this static notion of resilience, consid-
erable research effort shifted to determining whether resil-
ience is a measureable trait (Herrman et al., 2011). More
recently, researchers have begun to postulate whether resil-
ience is the "plastic" intermittent ability, which allows indi-
viduals to learn, adapt, and recover from their adversity
experiences that occur over the course of the human life span
(Atkinson, Martin, & Rankin, 2009; Luthar et al., 2000).
More recently still, a consensus view has begun to emerge
that resilience is a dynamic relationship between an individ-
ual's personal traits, lived experiences, environmental situa-
tion, psychosocial support system, and exposure to adversity
(Rutter, 2007; Seery, Holman, & Silver, 2010).
In terms of health resilience, it is now accepted that to
make a determination of resilience, two conditions need to
co-occur, namely, the presence of an adverse experience
and a manifest adaptation/coping competency. In this
regard, an ecological framework has been constructed in
which resilience is defined as being the human ability to
navigate a way forward toward accessing health sustaining
resources in culturally meaningful ways (Fergusson,
Harms, Pooley, Cohen, & Tomlinson, 2013; Unger, Brown,
Liebenberg, Cheung, & Levine, 2008). More specifically,
research has shown that resilience manifests itself differ-
ently within different families, cultural groups, and com-
munity settings. Finally, it has been suggested that resilience
is the posttraumatic growth potential to exhibit resourceful-
ness by using available internal and external recourses in
response to different contextual and developmental chal-
lenges (Pooley & Cohen, 2010). Posttraumatic growth
being typified by increases in self-reliance, expressiveness,
life appreciation, interpersonal relationships and spiritual-
ity, as well as changes to former goals and life priorities
(Pooley, Cohen, O'Connor, & Taylor, 2013).
The conceptualization of thriving has similarly undergone
considerable revision and, like resilience, is now considered
to be a multi-dimensional construct. Indeed, there has been
some blurring of these two strength-based concepts. For
instance, thriving postpartum mothers have been defined as
being individuals exhibiting a dynamic psychosocial growth
response to the motherhood challenge (Walker & Sterling,
2006). In addition, it is hypothesized that the "gain" aspect
derived from overcoming a challenge is what differentiates
thriving from the resilient overcoming of a "loss" experi-
ence. Regardless of whether it is the thriving lifestyle adapta-
tion to challenge (e.g., coping with a new baby, moving
house, planning a large family/community event, or under-
going additional training) or the resilient experience of over-
coming traumatic loss (e.g., a traumatic delivery, a newborn
with major health issues, relationship breakdowns, death,
migration, or financial ruin), the important issue is that CHNs
are adequately acquitted to fulfill their role of identifying
postpartum mothers who are, or are not coping with the
motherhood experience. In light of this need, the present
study sought to determine CHNs' understanding of the con-
cept of resilience and how they assess resilience in postpar-
tum mothers.
Method
Research Design
Unlike most qualitative studies that aim to generate theory or
findings that are transferable to a larger population, the sole
objective of exemplar studies such as this one is to develop
an understanding of a hitherto poorly understood phenome-
non within a defined context. A key attribute of exemplar
studies is that they allow data from within, and across, one or
more data sets to be intensely interrogated and rigorously
contrasted (Cresswell, 1998; Miles & Huberman, 1994;
Stake, 1995). Through this process, one small-scale study
Collins et al. 3
becomes the exemplar for other studies investigating the
same phenomenon. Flyvbjerg (2006) maintains that exem-
plar studies are critically important as "a scientific discipline
without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies
is a discipline without a systematic production of exemplars,
and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one" (p.
219). Whereas, as alluded to by Flyvbjerg, case studies char-
acteristically involve a single case, which is then studied in
depth over a protracted period of time, case studies can also
(as in the present study) involve a collective of cases (e.g., a
number of employees or work sites conducting the same
task) wherein multiple perspectives are studied so as to gen-
erate an across-case understanding of the investigated phe-
nomenon. Hence, the collective case study design is
sometimes used in workplace situations where it is impracti-
cal, impossible, or not permittable for a researcher to observe
a worker in action. In such instances, there is a greater reli-
ance on the interviewer's own workplace knowledge to
probe and elicit the necessary rich data that would allow for
an across-case investigation. The issue in such exemplar
studies is not so much the length of time spent following
each individual case, but rather the quality and depth of the
data gathered and the strength and expertise of the cross-case
analysis.
The strength of exemplar studies is that they generate
findings that by weight of their combined numbers produce
insights into the investigated phenomenon, which are reflec-
tive of the lived experience of the wider population (Punch,
2005; Stake, 1995). Unlike larger theory generating and
quantitative studies where tests of objectivity and credibility
are judged by the strength of their numerical evaluation or
thematic construction, the value of exemplar studies is
judged by whether they bring something new or different to
the understanding of the investigated phenomenon
(Hodkinson & Hodkinson, 2001).
This exemplar study sought to explore the CHNs' under-
standing of resilience and their means of assessing resilience
in postpartum mothers. Thematic analysis is not a prescrip-
tive research design, but rather is an analytical approach that
provides an "accessible and theoretically flexible means of
analysing qualitative data" (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 77).
Primarily because thematic analysis accurately reflects par-
ticipants' lived-realities and, in addition, unravels pertinent
aspects of these realities. The unraveled data threads become
the data categories, subthemes, and themes each of which,
according to Braun and Clarke, captures data that are impor-
tant to the investigated phenomenon. In this regard, thematic
analysis was considered to be a process suited to the investi-
gation of this sample of CHNs.
Participants
The sample comprised eight experienced CHNs working
within eight different child health clinics in Perth, Western
Australia. All the CHNs had between 2 and 30 years of
practice experience and held (or the equivalent of) a Graduate
Certificate in Child and Adolescent Health Nursing as well
as an additional qualification in the area of maternal, child,
and family health (e.g., a postgraduate diploma in child and
adolescent health nursing). Their practice experience was
derived from working with women across different socio-
economic groups and from culturally/linguistically diverse
backgrounds in the city's metropolitan and rural areas.
Procedure
Ethics approval was sought for the study from the adminis-
tering institution's Human Ethics Committee and from the
Department of Health's (DOH) Strategic Support Unit for
Child and Adolescent Community Health. The DOH granted
approval on two stipulations. First, due to workload and time
constraints, no more than eight CHNs would participate in
the project and, second, the initial CHN contact was to be
made via the district clinical nurse manager. As per DOH's
instructions, the nurse manger informed CHNs (via email) of
the study and requested prospective volunteers to contact the
first author directly.
On making contact, a mutually agreeable time and place
for the interview were arranged. In all cases, interviews were
conducted within the CHNs'45-min lunch break. Prior to the
start of the interview, each participant was informed of the
intent of the research and of his or her participatory rights.
The interview questions were informally delivered in a semi-
directive style so as to provide participants with the maxi-
mum opportunity to discuss the experiences they deemed
important to the understanding of resilience and its practice
manifestations in postpartum mothers.
Analysis
The interviews were transcribed verbatim within a few days
of having taken place. The accuracy of the transcriptions was
assured by having the second author randomly check the
accuracy of 50% of the first author's transcriptions. The tran-
scriptions were subsequently analyzed using thematic analy-
sis, which is the cornerstone of qualitative analysis as it
enables connections to be made between people's expressed
statements and their embedded meanings (Stirling, 2001).
The initial process required the interview transcripts to be
continually reread until salient points of interest emerged.
These points were recorded as a series of memos, which
were then grouped and ordered into basic units of meaning,
namely, categories (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Next, through a
synthesizing process of reordering, these categories were
clustered into subthemes (Pringle, Drummond, McLafferty,
& Hendry, 2011). Finally, through the process of continual
abstraction, these subthemes were regrouped into a small
number of encapsulating themes. In this way, the analysis
process allowed rich, vivid data "nested" in the participants'
real-life social contexts to be uncovered and explored
4 SAGE Open
(Pringle et al., 2011; Smith & Osborne, 2003; Thomas &
Harden, 2008).
To enhance the interpretive rigor of the analysis, two
authors independently analyzed the data sets. On comple-
tion, they crosschecked their themes and subthemes. Where
consensus occurred, the identified themes and subthemes
were accepted as being representative of the participants'
meaning. When differences occurred, these were discussed
with the third "judge" author until a consensus of meaning
was achieved (Sandelowski, 1986).
Findings
The analysis resulted in the emergence of two themes and
eight subthemes, which are displayed in Table 1 with addi-
tional illustrative quotes being displayed in Table 2.
Theme 1: CHNs' conceptualization of resilience in post-
partum mothers.
Subtheme 1: Resilience is the survival-orientated human
ability to rebound from adversity.
The most consistently expressed definition of resilience by
the CHNs was the notion that human beings have a survival-
orientated ability to rebound from adverse/traumatic experi-
ences. Typically, CHNs commented,
My understanding of resilience is that it's mums, or perhaps
even families, who've had a traumatic time, but are yet able to
survive. (CHN 8)
Although CHNs perceived resilience to be survival-orien-
tated, they also expressed an opinion that resilience is also
recovery-focused. They contended that in the recovery stage,
resilient individuals are not only able to "pick themselves up"
and "regain control" of their circumstances, but are also able
to apply "coping strategies" learnt during the course of han-
dling previous adversity experiences. One CHN explained,
Resilience is the state in which you're able to cope better with
life's traumas and adversities. Um . . . instead of it (the adversity/
traumatic experience) knocking you over. You get up and fight
on. You cope. You just get through life without every little
disaster becoming a major issue. (CHN 4)
Subtheme 2: Resilience is the human ability to project an
unflustered and future-orientated demeanor.
A second common perception among CHNs was that
resilience is an innate "relaxed personality trait" that allows
people to cope. One CHN described resilient mothers as
being "the so chilled sort of people who just get on and face
life." Another surmised,
Resilience is an innate characteristic that enables people to keep
going for want of a better word and to bounce-back when times
get tough . . . There's some argument that it can be taught.
Maybe it can, but I think it's an innate quality. (CHN 3)
The CHNs asserted that personality alone could not
explain why some postpartum mothers were more resilient
than others. Especially, as in their observations of postpar-
tum mothers, those who manifested a relaxed attitude and
were well supported by their family, friends, and broader
community, often had a greater capacity for resilience than
those with a more anxious personality and few avenues of
support. Although personality was considered to be an
important individual factor, CHNs contended that it is "your
environment and your experiences that also form you."
Typically stating,
We're all people, we've all got personalities and we've all had
life experiences. So nature and nurture have made the mother

the person she is . . . so whatever has shaped her has made her,
and her coping strategies would've moulded her. (CHN 6)
Subtheme 3: Resilience is the human ability to generate a
self-expectancy of future recovery.
A third consistently voiced interpretation of resilience
was that motherhood and resilience occur in tandem. The
CHNs asserted that mothers for millenniums have been adept
at coping with family-related adversities and personal trau-
mas and, reflected that a maternal coping expectancy not
only exists, but because it is so embedded within society it
has become self-reinforcing and, therefore, has become nor-
malized. One CHN reasoned,
Women are perceived as being resilient in society. We're meant
to cope because we're mothers. I think lots of mothers think they
have to cope because that's life. (CHN 4)
Another CHN asserted that when mothers are provided
with examples of their own coping qualities, then this mater-
nal resilience expectancy is further reinforced:
I think if other people have a belief in you and give you examples
of when you've bounced-back . . . then as a mother you're
expected . . . to deal with what's coming. (CHN 3)
Subtheme 4: Resilience building is a lengthy process.
Although in the CHNs' experience, well-supported postpar-
tum mothers generally displayed adequate levels of coping,
they also commented that this resilience is a finite quality.
For example, one CHS explained,
I've worked with people who've gone through lots of trauma
and torture in Sudan and I've thought they would have had
resilience. Some had and some hadn't. I think that's because

(CHN 6)
 "I certainly think it (positive outlook) does seem to make it easier for them. I think it's all a case of it (coping) just
builds up and builds up and if you have that (resilient) sort of personality you might get through it (adversity) quite
well." (CHN 4)

 "She's more aware of resources . . . She's not socially isolate and she's prepared to sort of engage with services."
(CHN 7)

months it will get easier." (CHN 4)
Self-confidence "Have better abilities, less levels of anxiety . . . more confident . . . less fearful of things that might happen, that could
have happened, that did happen . . . and have the confidence to think, actually yeah I'm doing a pretty good job
here." (CHN 4)
 "Not hard on themselves." (CHN 7)
 "Keeps her life normal." (CHN 8).

 "Knows how to access information and knows how to use it." (CHN 5)
Pragmatic "Not over dramatizing (problems) . . . and look at things in a problem solving approach." (CHN 1)
 "They're prepared to work through it (traumatic event) without actually giving up . . . knowing that what they're
going through is only a very temporary time." (CHN 4)
 "Can actually see what her day to day life is like." (CHN 2)
Communicative "Can express this (thoughts)." (CHN 2).
 "Can have a bit of a laugh while we are chatting." (CHN 5)
 "She's able to ask for help." (CHN 4)

 "Is comfortable talking about it (problem)." (CHN 7)
Receptive "More relaxed . . . open to advice." (CHN 8)
 "She's thinking well." (CHN 3)
Note. CHN = Child Health Nurse.
6 SAGE Open
some have been through so much they're just not able to go on
anymore. (CHN 3)
The CHNs also considered resilience to be a lengthy pro-
cess that took different mothers different amounts of time to
achieve. For instance, they explained that in their experience,
mothers whose exposure to adversity was recent were more
likely to display lower levels of resiliency than mothers who
had had a longer time to adjust. One CHN explained,
I think time has a lot to do with resilience. I mean you're not
resilient close to the event and some people take longer to
bounce-back. (CHN 2)
Subtheme 5: The resilience process involves grieving for
a personal loss.
A fifth commonly articulated perception of resilience was
that it is a process that involves some degree of grieving for
something lost. For, in the CHNs'experience, well-supported
mothers tended to come to terms with their sense of loss
quicker than did mothers with little/no avenue of support:
I think resilience is the ability to bounce-back after a very critical
life event whether it's giving birth, a death in the family or a loss
of any sort. So resilience is the ability to grieve over what you've
lost and, then, move on to a state of normality. (CHN 2)
Subtheme 6: Resilience is the human ability to learn from
past experience, reframe the now, and work forward.
The CHNs additionally described resilience as being the
post-adversity human ability to learn from "looking back" at
prior adversity experiences, "accepting" the new changed
circumstances, and, then, having the depth of "understand-
ing" and "inner strength" to "work forward" and "reframe"
their life. This reframing was seen to be critical not only
to maternal resilience but also to the well-being of the
infant. One CHN provided the following explanation of
"reframing":
They reframe things . . . not completely but enough to take a
perspective other than the emotional one. Maybe, even a rational
one. That helps them get over the hurt, the anger or whatever it
is that stops them from bouncing-back. (CHN 2)
Theme 2: CHNs' intuitive assessment of four protective
qualities manifest in resilient postpartum mothers
Although the CHNs articulated a theoretical understand-
ing of resilience, when it came to identifying resilience in
postpartum mothers, they suggested that this was an intuitive
skill that required years on the job observations. In this
regard, they described four protective qualities they believed
were indicative of maternal resilience, which are listed in
Table 2 and described in greater detail below.
Quality 1: Resilient mothers manifest positive attitudes
toward their changed postpartum circumstances.
One of the qualities in postpartum mothers that CHNs
considered to be a prime indicator of resilience was whether
the mother projected a positive attitude toward her present
circumstances. In particular, CHNs looked to see whether the
mother was pragmatic in her thinking, organized, adept at
"juggling things," and whether her speech was positive and
forward looking (e.g., "today is bad, but something cool
might happen tomorrow"). One CHN explained,
I'm thinking of one particular family, they've actually lost
everything. Their house is going to be sold and they're looking
at where they're going to live. They've got four children and
yet mum's resilience is I'm going to take this one day at a time
and we'll get through this. I'm amazed because it's pretty
tough. They're a resilient family as they're able to survive
with their heads up and their family together. She (mother)
said to me: "Even if we lose every cent we've got, we've still
got the kids and we're gonna survive. I call that resilience."
(CHN 8)
Quality 2: Resilient mothers interact and communicate
with their babies and are responsive to their needs.
In terms of bonding with their baby, the CHNs stated that
when a mother first enters the child health clinic, one of the
key indicators of whether she is resilient or not is how she
interacts and communicates with her baby. They explained
that the most resilient mothers were those who genuinely
were responsive to their baby's needs and were not putting
on a show. Two CHNs explained,
You can just watch them . . . the way they talk about the baby.
When the baby cries they respond. They talk to it as they're
coming into the clinic, they're encouraging it to look at things,
and they're telling it what they're doing. There's smiling, there's
cooing, they actually stop talking to you to coo at their lovely
baby. You can just see the whole relationship between the mum
and baby is working well. (CHN 4)
If she's resilient and has bounced-back after a traumatic birth
then she's very interested in the baby. She's responsive to baby
and to a big extent her thoughts are about baby and not about
what she has suffered. She handles baby gently, caring for baby.
She says positive things about baby and you can see there is a
good attachment there. (CHN 2)
Quality 3: Resilient mothers exude confidence in their
ability to overcome adversity.
The CHNs stated that another postpartum resilience indi-
cator is whether mothers exude self-confidence.
Particularly, whether they can see the bigger picture and
not be overwhelmed by issues of the moment. One CHN
explained,
Collins et al. 7
It's them knowing that the time they're going through now is
only temporary. That it'll get easier. They're looking at the
bigger picture. I think some mums are really good at doing that
and knowing that yes this is hard, but it'll pass. In a few months
it'll get easier and so to just take each day at a time and think, I
can cope, each day isn't gonna be like this hard. (CHN 4)
Quality 4: Resilient mothers establish social support net-
works and demonstrate a receptive willingness to reach
out for help and engage with local support networks.
The final postpartum resilience indicator that CHNs look
for is whether a mother has established a viable family/friend
support network. For, in their experience those mothers who
establish connections with local support networks (particu-
larly female support networks), engage with those support
networks on a regular basis, and are receptive to change.
Possibly, because they tend to have greater resources at their
disposal to assist them in making a swift recovery. One CHN
reasoned,
Women who talk about it (adversity) are aware that they'll get
out of their stressful situation a lot faster than will women who
don't talk about it. Generally, if the woman is more resilient . . .
they'll have more resources . . . more social supports. They're
probably engaging in services . . . as that's the thing that's going
to help them. (CHN 7)
Finally, the CHNs explained that mothers who "come
from places where they're used to handing babies over to
grandmas, aunties and other women then they've grown up
with the attitude that their child belongs to the community,
not just them." Moreover, such community connected moth-
ers they maintained were more resilient than their socially
isolated counterparts, as they were more self-assured about
reaching out and asking for help. One CHN concluded,
It's all about confidence . . . confidence in their abilities to deal
with things . . . It's just having confidence in their abilities to
know to ask for help and not thinking they've to do everything
on their own. (CHN 4)
Discussion
Childbirth is a significant event for women (Kendall-Tackett,
2014) and a negative experience can affect their long-term
mental health outcomes (see Henderson & Redshaw, 2013).
For, the mothers' perceptions of their delivery experience
and other circumstances occurring at the time of the delivery
not only affect the strength of the bonded relationship they
form with their infants, but also affect adaption to their par-
enting role. Consequently, there is a cost health benefit to
society in identifying early on and remediating confounding
issues that occur in postpartum mothers' lives. It is no won-
der then that since CHNs are the frontline interface with new
mothers they are tasked with the responsibility of identifying
mothers who are, and who are not, coping with their mother-
hood experience (i.e., are resilient). What is somewhat sur-
prising though is that although this CHN role is widely
recognized, little research endeavor has been focused on
examining the practice abilities of CHNs to fulfill the role.
Hence, this study sought to address this knowledge gap by
determining both CHNs' conceptual understanding of resil-
ience and the means by which they assess resilience in post-
partum mothers.
Resilience is conceptualized in the literature as being a
stability of psychological and social functioning following
an experience of high stress/trauma (Windle, 2011). It is
clear from this study's findings that CHNs' conceptualiza-
tion of resilience is largely congruent with this thinking. For,
they described resilience as being a composite of human
abilities, which allows individuals to work through the psy-
chosocial process of recovering from an adverse/traumatic
experience. Indeed, the most commonly articulated aptitude
described by CHNs was the human ability to "bounce-back"
post adversity to their pre-trauma state of normalcy. This
adaptive conceptualization of resilience is widely referred to
as being the manifest competency of individuals to cope with
severe experiences of stress (Connor, 2006). The second and
third human resilience abilities identified by CHNs were
those of projecting an unflustered future-orientated demeanor
and having an expectancy of recovery. Interestingly, these
two abilities have been listed as being central protective fac-
tors, which facilitate human resilience (Earvolino-Ramirez,
2007). The CHNs' fourth commonly expressed conceptual-
ization was that resilience is a lengthy process, which
involves grieving for and overcoming some form of loss.
This "loss" conceptualization of resilience is again consis-
tent with the resilience literature, which views resilience not
as a "one off," "get over it," obtain "closure" experience, but
rather as a gradual process of recovery (Walsh, 2007).
Interestingly, the CHNs conceptualized resilience as
being the human ability to learn from their loss experiences
and to reframe them in a more positive light. This reframing
conceptualization of resilience has been conceptualized as
being a recovery from loss ability that "involves making
meaning of the experience, putting it in perspective and
weaving the experience of loss and recovery into the fabric
of individual and collective identity and passage" (Walsh,
2007, p. 210). It is worthy to note, however, that none of the
study's CHNs linked resilience to the postadversity/trauma
experience of personal growth. This may be indicative that
the most recent advances in the conceptualization of resil-
ience have not been adequately conveyed to practicing
CHNs. The need to keep practicing CHNs informed of recent
advances in the understanding of recovery concepts (i.e.,
thriving and resilience) is pertinent given that it has been
determined that highly resilient women are not only capable
of posttraumatic growth, but are also less prone to serious
mental illness than are less resilient women (Harville, Xiong,
Buekens, Pridjian, & Elkind-Hirsch, 2010). (Also, the need
8 SAGE Open
to keep CHN informed of advances in the conceptual under-
standing of resilience is important because such knowledge
will help inform their health care delivery practices.)
Another interesting finding emanating from this study
was that when it came to assessing resilience in postpartum
mothers, CHNs relied on their intuitive knowledge rather
than on a formal means of assessment such as EPDS. Their
intuition was largely based on their years of on-the-job
training, which in turn enabled them to recognize four key
resilient qualities. First, was whether the mothers mani-
fested a positive attitude toward their changed circum-
stances. Second was whether the mothers interacted with
their baby and were responsive to its needs. Third was
whether the mothers exuded confidence in their ability to
overcome any changes in their postpartum life, and fourth,
whether the mothers had established a support network and
exhibited a willingness to reach out for help. The CHNs
maintained that the presentation of these four qualities was
an indicator of the mother's resilience. Although their con-
tention is consistent with the theoretical notion that resil-
ience is a set of personality traits, it should also be noted
that such traits do differ in their presentation from person to
person depending on the individual's situational circum-
stances and his or her adversity/trauma experience
(Newman, 2005; Wald et al., 2006). Finally, CHNs' four
observed four "protective" qualities in resilient postpartum
mothers (i.e., adaptation, responsiveness, self-confidence,
and social connectedness). Interestingly, these observed
"protective" qualities align with the contention that resil-
ience is a dynamic lifelong process of adapting to and cop-
ing with hardship (Atkinson et al., 2009; Rutter, 2007).
Although much of the study's CHNs'intuitive assessment
of resilience in postpartum mothers was based on outward
manifestations of coping, only one of the CHNs alluded to
the types of coping skills used by mothers as being rational
(problem focused) and emotional (reframing) in nature (see
Maud, 2004). The possibility that resilient mothers use both
adaptive (rational) and maladaptive (emotional) forms of
coping is an area that requires further investigation. Hence,
future research may seek to evaluate the coping styles of
postpartum mothers so as to determine whether resilient
mothers do indeed use predominantly adaptive styles of cop-
ing (i.e., rational and detached coping) and, conversely,
whether less resilient mothers predominantly use maladap-
tive coping styles (i.e., emotional and avoidance coping). Or,
indeed, whether mothers use a combination of coping styles
as suggested by this study. It is posited that engagement in
such a determination of postpartum coping styles will be
beneficial to nursing practices in terms of shaping how CHNs
may best interact with postpartum mothers.
Limitations of the Study
One limitation of this study was that data collection was lim-
ited to a single 45 minute interview period. This constraint is
understandable given the interviews were conducted in the
CHNs lunch breaks. This restriction prevented the research-
ers from confirming the emerged themes with the CHNs.
A second limitation of this study's small homogeneous
sample is its size. Although eight participants are entirely
acceptable for a small-scale qualitative study, it should be
noted that its data lack sufficient power to generate substan-
tive theory, which in turn could be applied to other popula-
tions. Rather, this study's themes and subthemes should be
seen as mega-categories (Bazeley, 2009). The benefit of
developing such meta-categories is that they can be subse-
quently used in future empirical studies to determine whether
the perceptions of this study's participants hold true in differ-
ent settings. Thus, although this study's findings are sugges-
tive of current practices, they should not be construed as
being generalizable to the wider CHN population.
Conclusion
Until future research in the field of resilience resolves the
definitional debate on whether resilience is a set of traits, a
dynamic process, or some combination of both and develops
appropriate measures for testing resilience, it is likely that
CHNs will continue to base their maternal resilience assess-
ments on their intuitive observations. Undoubtedly, the ideal
would be for CHNs to use a combination of both intuitive
observances and formal resilience testing measures. For, a
combination approach would increase practice consistency.
Another ideal would be for greater practice/research collabo-
ration in the effort to determine not only where the boundar-
ies of postpartum resilience lies, but also what balance of
human abilities/qualities determines whether postpartum
mothers are (or are not) operating within the same functional
range of resilience as are non-postpartum women. The ben-
efit of such research endeavor would be the enhancement of
CHNs' capabilities to reach out to mothers and facilitate
positive mental health outcomes (e.g., resourcefulness, har-
diness, and growth) during the postnatal period (Herrman
et al., 2011). This critical CHN reaching-out connecting role
is particularly important in instances were mothers have situ-
ational, social, and cultural challenges.
