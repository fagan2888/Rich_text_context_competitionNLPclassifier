Abstract: Prior research has examined the impact of community-oriented policing (COP) on crime
extensively. While the implementation of community policing has been considered mainly within
the context of large police agencies, there is a paucity of research on how COP impacts crime
reduction efforts in smaller locales. This study explores the effects of the degree of community
policing implementation within smaller agencies and cities on crime. As part of the discussion on
the impact of COP implementation, this paper also considers the impact of social disorganization
on crime in the United States. The aim is to gain further insight into what variables may be
influencing crime rates in contexts that garner less attention from researchers. The findings indicate
that COP implementation does not significantly explain the variation of crime rates. Still, the
statistically significant results on several social disorganization factors reflect the need to
incorporate social disorganization theory with practice in order to maximize community-policing
success. The implications of these results for police practice as well as directions for future research
are discussed.
Keywords: community policing; social disorganization; crime prevention; communities and crime
1. Introduction
The ebb and flow of police-citizen relations has garnered a great deal of attention from scholars
and practitioners. The need to examine policing strategies is increasingly important due to the
questionable incidents of officer-involved shootings in minority communities in the United States.
The aftermath of public outrage often characterized by Black Lives Matter protests, and riots in some
instances are additional reasons why policing strategies are worthy of scholarly assessment. Some
have argued that community-oriented policing (COP) is part of a necessary prescription for building
trust in many large metropolitan areas where such police-civilian conflicts often occur (Gill et al. 2014;
Kelling and Moore 1988). It is also widely held that community-oriented approaches can be successful
in reducing crime in problematic inner-city areas (Connell et al. 2008; Rosenbaum and Lurigio 1994).
Although most empirical studies examine policing strategies such as COP within the context of
large metropolitan cities and agencies, it is equally important to contribute to the limited research on
smaller populations to increase knowledge of the applicability of COP in less studied settings.
In addition, it is important to note that crime is not the sole burden of police. Rather than focusing
solely on policing strategies, it is reasonable to incorporate social factors into crime prevention
frameworks (Brogden and Nijhar 2005). Based on this reasoning, we bring the theory of social
disorganization into this discussion. We suggest that the practical implications of COP and the
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 2 of 16
theoretical implications of social disorganization are complementary perspectives that ought to be
considered together. Moreover, prior research shows that individuals living in socially
disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to hold less favorable views of police and experience
higher crime rates (Kubrin and Weitzer 2003; Sampson and Bartusch 1998), and neighborhoods that
in theory should benefit the most from COP are often the locales that are most resistant to any type
of formal control (Grinc 1994). It is also noteworthy that communities with weaker social ties and
higher levels of disorganization may be subject to higher crime rates due to changes in routine
activities (Andresen 2006).
The ongoing discussion on crime in communities should therefore not only comprise the
implementation of COP, but also solutions for improving social organization conditions. Throughout
the implementation stages of COP, if community conditions are not accounted for, the introduction
of these strategies might prove to be more harmful than beneficial to some communities. With these
issues in mind, this study examines the degree of community policing implementation while
controlling for social disorganization factors. The analysis is based on data collected from a national
sample of small police agencies and cities across the US. We also discuss the implications for police
practice and directions for future research on crime prevention in smaller cities.
1.1. The Context of Community-Oriented Policing Implementation
In our quest to understand the nuances of community-oriented policing, the exclusion of smaller
departments and populations may be problematic due to the dissimilarities in how crime is generated
within urban and rural areas. Moreover, the extent to which citizens are willing to act as co-producers
of crime control alongside law enforcement also differs based on the social organization of the
communities in which community-oriented policing is implemented (Gill et al. 2014; Greene and
Pelfrey 2001). Nonetheless, what has become increasingly evident amid recent backlashes against the
police, is that COP has become preferred to the traditional model of policing that relied largely on
reactive measures such as issuing tickets and making arrests (Maguire and Mastrofski 2000; Pelfrey
2004).
To address the gap in the literature, in terms of nonmetropolitan communities, Wells and
Weisheit (2004), used county-level data to examine whether crime-predicting variables used in urban
models were in fact applicable to rural settings. Contrary to their original hypotheses, the researchers
found that ecological and structural characteristics predicted urban crime to a better extent than rural
crime, leaving them to conclude that the set of variables that best predicted crime in urban areas were
not the same variables that predicted rural crime rates.
Therefore, understanding the context in which COP is implemented is extremely vital to the
success of the strategy. As noted by Brogden and Nijhar (2005), when community conditions are
unaccounted for during the implementation of COP, the introduction of these strategies may prove
to be more harmful than constructive to communities. Disregarding community composition, could
make the goal of reducing fear of crime, or increasing police legitimacy through the building of citizen
relationships, practically unattainable.
1.2. Social Disorganization
The theory of social disorganization can be traced to the Chicago School and the work of Shaw
and McKay (1942), and it has come a long way since its original conceptualization. Shaw and McKay
(1942) were one of the first to argue that communities that lack necessary resources due to low
economic status would generally have weaker social cohesion (i.e., social ties) and in return be subject
to higher crime rates. To further support the theory, recent literature has linked structural
characteristics to crime and delinquency and has provided claims that informal controls can mediate
the relationship between the two (Bursik and Webb 1982; Hart and Waller 2013; Smith and Jarjoura
1988). To extend the study of community social disorganization and crime beyond urban settings,
Osgood and Chambers (2000) conducted county-level analysis on more than 250 nonmetropolitan
counties across four states. The study found not only that the themes from the theory are applicable
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 3 of 16
to communities of all sizes, but also that nonmetropolitan communities present different patterns of
structural variables that are worth examining further.
The more recent studies on social disorganization seek to incorporate informal controls such as
collective efficacy and social cohesion to obtain a better understanding of community conditions and
their relation to crime. Collective efficacy is a predictor of community functioning (Warner 2007) and
is generally represented by trust in residents, a willingness to intervene in neighborhood problems
and maintaining social controls for the common good (Sampson 2012). Social cohesion is formed
through neighborhood interaction and generally leads to stronger social ties (Gau 2014; Sampson and
Raudenbush 1999). Uchida et al. (2014) explain that when social cohesion and or trust among
neighbors is at its peak, the potential to build upon collective action or collective efficacy is greater.
In short, however, it can be summarized that if a community is facing hardships and lacks necessary
informal controls needed to prevent crime, formal controls, such as the intervention of COP officers,
may prove to be ineffective or not accepted (Sampson 2012; Warner 2007).
When discussing the differential levels of disorganization in communities as they relate to crime
and deviance, it is important not to neglect supporting theories such as routine activities and the idea
of capable guardianship. Both the theory of social disorganization and routine activities share the
idea that crime has a geography and, because human behavior is often situated in a particular place,
the location of crime must be heavily emphasized (Andresen 2006). Cohen and Felson (1979), the
study often credited for developing the routine activity theory, contends that for crime to occur there
must be a motivated offender, a suitable target, and a perceived lack of guardianship. To relate this
theory back to social disorganization, it must be acknowledged that different locales--due to their
differing socio-economic characteristics and demographics, display different routine activities which
in turn leads to crime and deviance being neither uniformly or randomly distributed (Mustaine and
Tewksbury 1998).
1.3. Community-Oriented Policing
Community-oriented policing strategies vary across agencies as some may require different
strategies to tackle unique community-related problems. This variance may be regarded as
disadvantageous to the extent that it prevents a uniform definition and implementation of COP,
however, it is advantageous in the sense that each agency can implement the strategy as necessary to
the community that it serves. However, defining community-oriented policing is much easier said
than done. Consensus has not been reached on defining COP (Sozer and Merlo 2013), but it is
generally referred to as a philosophy that aims to empower communities rather than control them.
COP encourages police to find solutions for a multitude of community problems and concerns such
as crime, fear of crime, quality of life, and neighborhood conditions (Lord et al. 2009; Reisig and Parks
2004).
Since its rise in popularity over the last thirty years, notably during the mid-1990s with the
creation of the Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), many law
enforcement agencies in the US have implemented programs that are generally in accordance with
the overall components of community policing (Somerville 2009; Morabito 2010). These components
include community partnerships, organizational transformation and problem-solving, with terms
such as "community involvement" and "decentralization" often used interchangeably (Somerville
2009).
Most advocates of COP believe that it can strengthen cohesion among community residents as
well as social organization, further leading to reduced crime and disorder (Kerley and Benson 2000;
Sadd and Grinc 1994). It is important to understand, however, that community-oriented policing does
not flow in one direction--police to community--but instead works best when there is a flow
between the two (Bain et al. 2014). To that point, a proactive style of policing is more likely to garner
positive public perceptions of police and allow for COP initiatives to function more effectively (Wentz
and Schlimgen 2012). Positive encounters with police should then theoretically increase community
confidence in police work and relationships in which members are willing to approach officers with
their local problems (Bain et al. 2014). This in turn may lead to higher crime reporting rates in
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 4 of 16
communities in which COP is implemented properly. This type of outlook should not be dismissed
but instead considered when answering the question as to why studies on COP effectiveness may
have varying conclusions regarding increasing and decreasing crime rates.
Gill et al. (2014) conducted a meta-analysis that included thirty-seven independent tests on COP.
Their study found evidence that community policing increased citizen satisfaction and perceptions
of police legitimacy. However, regarding crime prevention, Gill et al. (2014) did not find any
consistent evidence to support the assumption that COP influences crime rates. Moreover, they found
that problem-solving strategies, whether utilized within an agency or not, also had no impact on
crime rates. In general, their study produced support for the main objective of COP in improving the
relationship between the community and public, but as noted by the researchers, their findings were
also a reflection of the complexities in the relationship between COP and all other variables, such as
disorder, fear, and social controls.
1.4. Community-Oriented Policing and Nonmetropolitan Communities
Contributing to the limited research on COP and nonmetropolitan communities, Connell et al.
(2008) examined whether community policing can reduce serious crime in a suburban setting. The
researchers used data from both, interviews conducted with officers involved in a COP initiative, as
well as crime rates over an eight-year period within the locations that COP was implemented.
Running a time series analysis on the data, the researchers found a significant reduction in property
and violent crimes in areas that COP was implemented. Furthermore, the interview portion showed
that the officers involved in COP were very eager to implement strategies within their jurisdiction.
Officers who did not share this view within the department were able to switch beats and shift to
other positions within the agencies. By doing so, the potential success of the COP strategies would
not be hindered by those who lacked interest in the intervention. This supports the argument made
by Sadd and Grinc (1994), that in order for community-oriented policing to be successful, officers or
personnel must believe in the means and goals.
Sozer and Merlo (2013) provide a foundation for the present study, as their main objective had
been to examine the relationship between level of implementation of COP and crime rates across
various agency sizes. To observe this relationship, the researchers separated agencies by those
serving fewer than 50,000 individuals and those serving more than 50,000 individuals. Furthermore,
three dimensions were used to measure the level of COP implementation across agencies. These
included community contribution, problem-solving partnerships and training, and problem-solving,
which were all created through reducing 35 dichotomous variables through factor analysis. In the
end, Sozer and Merlo (2013) found no evidence of COP in terms of a crime reduction effect, and in
contrast to expectations, the researchers found certain community policing strategies to be associated
with higher crime rates in both small and large cities.
The need to examine community-oriented policing implementation outside of urban areas is due
in part to the recognition that structural variables present differently in nonmetropolitan locations
than they do in urban ones (Kaylen and Pridemore 2013; Osgood and Chambers 2000). As stated by
Adams et al. (2005), more often than not, these smaller departments that lack empirical evaluations
are those that comprise the majority of publicly funded law enforcement agencies. Moreover, since
community-oriented policing is based on the idea of strengthening the social organization of
communities, it is surprising that an underwhelming amount of research has been directed towards
examining the relationship between the two, especially as various community characteristics might
also influence styles of policing (Maguire et al. 1997). The purpose of this present study is not only to
determine COP's effect on violent and property crime, it is also to examine whether COP
implementation can predict crime rates when controlling for social disorganization.
2. Materials and Methods
This study merges three data sets--The 2013 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics Survey (LEMAS), the 2012 Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), and the 2012 US Census 5-Year
American Community Survey (ACS). The aim was to examine both the implementation of COP
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 5 of 16
within 309 law enforcement agencies as well as social organization and crime rates in the areas where
these agencies are located. The study sought to answer the following questions: (1) Is the
implementation of community policing predictive of crime rates, controlling for agency size and
indicators of social disorganization? (2) Are characteristics of social disorganization predictive of
crime rates in small cities? It was hypothesized that there would be an inverse relationship between
the degree of COP implementation and crime rates. It was also expected that variables pertaining to
social disorganization would influence both property and violent crime rates.
To create a sample of smaller-sized law enforcement agencies and jurisdictions, only those
employing between 40­80 full-time sworn personnel were included within the study. Therefore, from
the initial LEMAS dataset comprised of 2822 law enforcement agencies, the following agencies were
eliminated: 895 sheriff's offices, 50 state agencies, agencies with 100 or more sworn personnel, and
agencies with 39 or fewer sworn full-time personnel. Moreover, after merging and examining all three
datasets, 3 agencies were eliminated due to an extensive amount of missing LEMAS data, 1 agency
was eliminated due to not holding a primary jurisdiction within the ACS or UCR data, and 15
agencies were deleted as there was neither property nor violent crime rate data available. The final
sample size therefore consisted of 309 law enforcement agencies.
The dependent variables, property and violent crime rates, were generated from the 2012 Crime
Reporting Program using the FBI's classifications for each offense. Burglary, larceny-theft, and motor
vehicle theft were combined to form the property variables, whereas murder, forcible rape, robbery,
and aggravated assault were combined to form the composite violent crime variable. Although arson
is a part of the FBI property crime classification, it was not included in the present study as issues
existed in reporting. To control for population size, crime rate per 1000 residents was used.
2.1. Measuring Community-Oriented Policing Implementation
Regarding the measurement of COP implementation, we used 2013 LEMAS data to generate a
single composite-variable. At the time of writing, these were the most recent available national-level
data on the subject. Variables that best fell in line with the overarching theme of COP presented by
the Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services (COPS) were selected to form an index variable.
These variables included problem-solving partnerships, geographic assignment of officers, the
encouragement of SARA­type (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Evaluation) problem-solving
projects, the utilization of information from community survey, and lastly, at least 8 h of in-service
COP training. These variables, which were captured through the survey design in a dichotomous
fashion, were then coded into new variables in which 0 signified "no," and 1 signified "yes." Within
the context of the index variable, a 0 therefore meant no implementation whereas 5 highlighted the
implementation of all variables within an agency. The variations of implementation are depicted in
Figure 1.
Figure 1. Frequency of COP implementation.
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 6 of 16
It is evident from the descriptive statistics that of the 309 law enforcement agencies selected for
the study, the majority of agencies (n = 77), reported implementing at least 3 of the 5 community-
oriented policing strategies included in this study, whereas only 27 implemented all 5 strategies
within their agencies. The remaining agencies reported implementing zero, one, two, or four
strategies and of the 309 agencies, seven agencies did not report for any of these five strategies and
are not depicted in the figure. In addition, the total number of full-time sworn personnel was used as
a control for law enforcement agency size. Based on the definition provided by LEMAS, sworn
personnel are deputies and law enforcement officers with general arrest powers. Only agencies
employing between 40­80 full-time sworn personnel were included in the study to depict smaller-
sized agencies.
2.2. Measuring Social Disorganization
The underlying theme of social disorganization emphasizes both environmental and social
characteristics in explaining the etiology of crime and anti-social behavior (Shaw and McKay 1942).
This study utilized the Census Bureau's 2012 American Community Survey to depict the social
organization of cities in which community-oriented policing was implemented. The variables
included were the percentage of individuals whose income was below the poverty level, percentage
of individuals foreign-born, percentage of female householders with children under the age of 18
with no husband present, and percentage of the population black or African American (See Table 1).
Although the study initially incorporated the percentage of renter occupied housing units, the
variable was removed due to its high level of collinearity with the percentage of individuals whose
income is below the poverty level.
Table 1. Measures of Central Tendency of Independent, Dependent, and Control Variables (n = 309).

Violent Crime 0.10 49.93 49.83 3.54 2.42 4.79
Although skewed data indicates that outliers exist, in a study examining the social organization
of 309 various cities located across the US, these outliers are almost expected. Moreover, the variation
in variables such as the percentage of population black or African American or percentage of
individuals whose income is below the poverty level for example, are a clear indicator of the
importance of taking the social context of communities into consideration when deploying policing
strategies.
In order to yield a model that infers any relationship between variables and their predictive
power within the observed populations, the statistical technique utilized for this study was ordinary
least square (OLS) regression. This allows for the identification of any unique contributions made by
the key independent variables and likewise allows for the determination of how well the model
accounts for or explains the variations that occur in the dependent variable.
3. Results
To gain better understanding of the impact of each of the variables included within the
community-oriented policing implementation outside of the index variable, the model depicted in
Table 2 examines each community policing strategy and its overall impact on the variation of both
property and violent crime rates separately. Table 3 shows the impact of the composite COP variable
and its effect on crime rates alone without the inclusion of any social disorganization characteristics.

When examined individually, the five community-oriented policing strategies, including
problem-solving partnerships, geographic assignment of officers, the encouragement of SARA--type
problem solving projects, the utilization of information from community surveys, and at least 8 hours
of in-service COP training showed no significant contributions to the variations of property and
violent crime rates. Both models held very low R-values of 0.108 in the property crime model, and
0.175 in the violent crime model. Therefore, given the low R-values and F ratios that are not
statistically significant, the models did not hold high explanatory power. Likewise, although
insignificant it is interesting to note that a one-increment increase in the geographic assignment of
officers (beat patrol), and the utilization of information from community surveys were associated
with higher rates of reported property crimes.

The regression model for the community-oriented policing composite variable provides similar
results to the findings presented in Table 2. Although an argument can be made that community-
oriented policing implementation alone makes no significant contribution to the variation of property
and violent crime rates, the null results should not be viewed in a negative light. Instead, it should
be noted that the overall directions of the results displayed in Table 3 are in the direction originally
hypothesized. Nonetheless, the R-value of the property crime model is extremely low, at only 0.021
whereas the R-value of the violent crime model reaches 0.080. In addition, both F-ratios are not
statistically significant, further indicating the lack of contribution made to the models by the
composite variable.
3.1. The Full Model
The full model demonstrates the changes in significance when theory and practice are
integrated. In Table 4, property crime rate per 1000 and violent crime rate per 1000 are regressed
against the following variables, the total number of full-time personnel, COP implementation,
percentage of the population black or African American, percentage of individuals foreign-born,
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 8 of 16
percentage of female householders with child under the age of 18 and no husband present, and
percentage of individuals whose income is below the poverty level, using the enter method.

According to Hinton et al. (2014), the closer the R-value is to 1.00, the higher the explanatory or
predictive power of the model. Evaluating the results of the multiple regression model displayed in
Table 4, the property crime rate model had an approximate R-value of 0.587, whereas the violent
crime model held an R-value of 0.561. The predictive power of the models as determined through the
ANOVA test and F ratio indicated a statistically significant result at the 0.000 level for property crime
rates (25.75) and likewise a statistically significant result for violent crime rates (21.69). This is an
indication that the models' predictions of changes in the dependent variables are more accurate than
just chance alone. The property crime model accounted for 34.4% of the variance in the population,
with an adjusted R-Square of 33.1%. In terms of the violent crime model, the model accounted for
31.5% of the variance in the population with an adjusted R-Square of 30.1% indicating a slightly more
powerful property crime model than the latter. Provided that most models in criminal justice research
do not exceed 40% (Weisburd and Britt 2007), it can be said that both models predict crime rates fairly
well. The contribution of individual variables within the models will be examined subsequently.
3.2. The Property Crime Model
The control variable of full-time sworn personnel had the second weakest contribution to the
model with a Beta of -0.033. However, it was found that a one-increment increase in the amount of
full-time sworn personnel resulted in a 0.054 decrease in property crime per 1000, which is in the
direction hypothesized but not statistically significant. The amount of COP implementation, which
ranged on a 0­5 scale, did not make a statistically significant contribution to the property crime model
as it had the lowest Beta of -0.001. However, a one-increment increase in the amount of
implementation resulted in a 0.017 decrease in crime, which is also in the direction hypothesized but
not holding any statistical significance. The percentage of the population black or African American
had a rather weak contribution to the property crime model with a Beta of 0.039. Although not
statistically significant, a one-increment increase in Black or African American individuals resulted
in an increase of property crimes per 1000 by 0.041, which is in the direction originally hypothesized.
A significant predictor to the property crime model was the independent variable of percentage
foreign-born individuals with a Beta of -0.236. This variable had an unstandardized coefficient of
-0.435, therefore holding all other variables constant, a one-increment increase of foreign-born
individuals equates to a decrease of 0.435 in property crime rates per 1000. Although in the direction
hypothesized, it is important to note that this result is contrary to the theory of social disorganization,
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 9 of 16
which asserts that communities with more foreign-born individuals have less social cohesion and
more crime.
Percentage of female householder with child under the age of 18 and no husband present was
the second strongest and significant predictor of property crime rates with a Beta of 0.272. This
variable had an unstandardized coefficient of 1.442, which means that holding all other variables
constant, a one-increment increase in the percentage of female householders equates to a 1.442
increase in property crime rates per 1000, an expected result in accordance to the hypothesis. In terms
of contribution to the prediction, the percentage of individuals whose income is below the poverty
level was the highest significant predictor of property crime rates per 1000 with a Beta of 0.273. This
variable had an expected unstandardized B coefficient of 0.513, which means that a one-increment
increase in the number of individuals whose income is below the poverty level equates to a 0.513
increase in property crimes per 1000. Thus, a 10% increase would result in an additional 5 crimes per
person.
3.3. Violent Crime Model
In the violent crime model, full-time sworn personnel also had the second weakest contribution
with a Beta of 0.068, indicating that a one-increment increase in full-time sworn personnel resulted in
a 0.029 increase in violent crime. Not only was this result insignificant, it was also not in the direction
hypothesized. Moreover, COP implementation also made a weak contribution to the model with a
-0.057 Beta. However, a one-increment increase in the amount of implementation within an agency
resulted in a 0.204 decrease in crime, a result greater than what was seen with the property crime
model. Nonetheless, while this result is in the direction hypothesized, it did not hold any statistical
significance. Percentage of the population black or African American had a rather strong and
significant contribution to the model with a beta of 0.136. This result is in the direction hypothesized.
The percentage of foreign-born individuals did not make a significant contribution to the model,
holding a Beta of -0.083. However, similar to the property crime model, a one-increment increase of
foreign-born individuals also resulted in a 0.040 decrease in violent crime rates per 1000, a result in
agreement with the hypothesis but in overall contrast to social disorganization literature. The
strongest contribution to the model was made by the percentage of female householders with
children under the age of 18 and no husband present, with a Beta of 0.322. These findings reflect the
hypothesis and literature on the theory of social disorganization. Lastly, percentage of individuals
whose income is below the poverty level also made a strong significant contribution to the model.
These findings are consistent with decades of research on poverty and crime.1
4. Discussion
The purpose of this study was to observe the variations of community-oriented policing
implementation within smaller agencies while accounting for the social context. Predictors of social
disorganization alongside community policing variables were examined to assess their impact on
both property and violent crime rates within smaller locales. To measure implementation, five main
strategies that fell under the general definition of community-oriented policing were combined to
form an additive scale in which all variables were comprised of equal weight. These strategies
included problem-solving projects, utilization of community surveys, the encouragement of SARA­
type problem-solving projects, the geographic assignment of officers, and at least 8-h of in-service
community policing training.
Of the 309 agencies observed, the majority (77) of these agencies implemented at least three of
the five strategies within their departments, whereas only 27 reported implementing all five.
Although it was hypothesized that controlling for both agency size and social disorganization, a
greater degree of COP implementation would be associated with fewer property and violent crime
1 We also conducted a poisson regression with these data to determine whether this would make a difference
in the observed relationships. However, there were no noteworthy differences found when comparing the
findings from the OLS model and the additional analyses. Additional analyses can be provided upon request.

rates across smaller locales, this study did not find any strong evidence to justify that community-
oriented policing implementation impacts city-level crime rates (Gill et al. 2014; Kerley and Benson
2000; Sozer and Merlo 2013). It is important to note, however, that although not statistically
significant, the findings of the study were in the direction hypothesized and call for further
consideration.
The null results can be explained as follows. First, the adoption of community policing occurred
at a time in which the professional model became highly criticized and deemed ineffective (Roh and
Oliver 2005). Agencies that began implementing COP shifted away from reactive measures and
primarily focused on finding ways to proactively respond to crime and on becoming more attentive
to physical and social community disorder to decrease fear of crime and find solutions to local
problems. It was not until the mid-1990s, with the establishment of the Justice Department's Office
of Community-Oriented Policing Services, that crime reduction became an increasingly important
objective behind particular strategies (Skogan 2006). As a result, community-oriented policing began
to be evaluated in terms of its crime reduction potential. However, as stressed by Gill et al. (2014), it
is ironic that researchers continue to dedicate time and resources towards evaluating COP on its
ability to reduce crime rates. It has become clear that achieving a direct impact on crime rates was
never the primary objective of COP to begin with. Therefore, by disregarding the success of
community policing on factors such as the decrease in fear of crime or increase in police legitimacy,
and instead deeming the practice as either effective or ineffective based solely on its ability to impact
crime rates, defies the basis of the philosophy.
Community policing, based on its success in creating positive shifts in police-citizen culture,
should instead be regarded as a catalyst for social change and order. The reduction of fear of crime is
just as important as the reduction of crime rates themselves and allows for a community to self-police.
Individuals will not act on crime control if they have any indication or fear that their actions may
affect their safety in any way (Bureau of Justice Assistance 1994). Furthermore, when police engage
in community-oriented strategies that indirectly impact crime, they potentially improve relationships
with the public while increasing police presence. This increased level of presence alone, has the ability
to raise levels of satisfaction among community members, allowing for the growth of social cohesion
and collective efficacy within their communities to occur (Trojanowicz 1983). An increase in informal
controls likewise increases the likelihood that formal authorities, such as COP officers within the
community, will be contacted when criminal or deviant activity occurs. Therefore, though it may
seem paradoxical, it should be expected that communities with effective COP implementation will in
fact have higher rates of reported crime in the short-term.
When it comes to integrating practice with theory, scholars have suggested that community-
oriented policing must be cognizant of the characteristics of the community in which it is
implemented. COP is also at its strongest when risk factors or influences of crime such as economic
disadvantage or varying levels of family disruption are considered (Sherman and Eck 2006; Sozer
and Merlo 2013). Implementing any type of formal control, without considering social context may
instead lead to a backfire effect which can be manifested in declining public support for police. This
has become evident in disorganized locales in Fergusson, Missouri and Baltimore, Maryland, after
highly publicized incidents involving police use-of-force decisions and the death of unarmed
residents. The influence of some social disorganization factors supports the assertion that there
remains a need to assess policing strategies and the extent to which they are implemented within
communities. The main findings are addressed below.
Extant research has provided evidence that neighborhoods with more concentrated
disadvantage generally experience an increase of crime over a period of time (Bellair 1997; Hart and
Waller 2013; Sampson and Groves 1989). While the findings of this study are in support of prior
research, it cannot be assumed that disadvantage necessarily causes more crime. Although this is
outside the scope of this study, there may be evidence of reciprocal effects between disadvantage and
crime, in that, crime and disadvantage are bidirectional in nature--each variable is influenced by the
other. In addition, the race variable in this study presented noteworthy findings. While scholars have
suggested that social disorganization is far more prominent in communities with a higher percentage
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 11 of 16
of Black or African American individuals, our findings are in support of Hipp (2010) who found no
relationship between the percentages of population Black or African American and property crime,
but a positive association with violent crime. With more recent literature breaking the stereotype
associated with people of color, one may question whether race is merely a proxy for social factors
that impact residents who live in cumulatively poor conditions.
We must also consider the influence of family disruption on crime. This proved to be one of the
strongest contributors to the full model. There was a significant positive relationship between both
property and violent crime rates and the percentage of female-headed households with children
under the age of 18 and no husband present. As expressed by Silva (2014), due to significantly less
parental monitoring within households, communities with a higher degree of family disruption not
only experience weaker social controls, but also predict crime rates to a greater extant. Nonetheless,
implementing community policing initiatives within these communities that may drive children
away from acts of deviance may alleviate the degree to which crime occurs. This once again addresses
the importance of viewing COP as, at best, an indirect crime fighting tool.
4.1. Limitations
This study is not without limitations. Due to the lack of a uniform definition of community
policing, as well as a uniform system of implementing strategies within agencies, the measurement
constructed for COP implementation in this study may not have been an accurate representation of
implementation across all agencies. Moreover, there may be significant differences between small
town or rural policing organizations and larger urban areas. Caradelli et al. (1998) suggested that
community policing might not be implemented to its full potential in many smaller locales as officers
assume community cohesion and social control mechanisms are deeply rooted in such tight knit
communities. This type of reliance may translate into less formally structured strategies being
implemented.
In addition to differential implementation, the binary approach in coding the implementation of
individual COP items (0 = No, 1 = Yes) did not capture the nuances of design and community policing
strategies within departments. This limitation may be traced to the data itself. With most community
policing questions requiring departments to either answer yes or no, the results of the 2013 LEMAS
survey did not acquire optimal explanatory power. Thus, while the questions allow for the basic
assessment of whether agencies utilize COP strategies, there is no knowledge of how these strategies
are implemented and to what degree. This leads to further problems in addressing similarities across
departments. More in-depth investigations may reveal that two departments utilizing the same
strategy may in fact be implementing it in a vastly different manner. Police departments may even
be implementing strategies that are praiseworthy in nature but yet do not reflect the needs of their
communities.
Issues with the measurement of social disorganization can also be addressed. Due to data
limitations the theory was not tested at the community level but at the city level. Although it can be
argued that the theory should be tested at varied levels in order to contribute to literature, examining
the theory under such a broad scope did not allow for the measurement of variables that are generally
accounted for in the extended models of the theory (friendship networks, social ties). It is evident that
since the re-establishment of the theory, studies conducted on social disorganization incorporate
social ties and informal controls such as collective efficacy and cohesion into their models as they
play a vital role in achieving the best representation of community social disorganization. However,
the inclusion of these variables could have potentially hindered the study, as a precise definition of
these concepts is lacking. As explained by Kubrin and Weitzer (2003), this conceptual fuzziness does
not allow for a clear understanding of the distinction between certain variables such as social ties and
informal controls.
It is also acknowledged that the crime rates used in this study may have been underreported.
A shortcoming of the UCR data is that only crimes known to police are included and not reports of
victimization. Local police therefore may underestimate the true value of crime given that all
individuals in a community report their experiences. It should also be considered that unreported
Soc. Sci. 2018, 6, 35 12 of 16
crime may be resolved through internal community action rather than formal law enforcement
procedures, and this phenomenon may not be reflected in official crime statistics (Winfree and
Newbold 1999). While it is acceptable to use UCR data despite these limitations, future research
should consider using National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data and further comparing the
results across data sources. This study utilized a cross-sectional design. Depending on the context of
a study, focusing on only one time period may not necessarily produce the most accurate results and
may not be able to capture change in demographics, COP implementation and crime rates. As argued
by Steenbeek and Hipp (2011) there are pros and cons to using cross-sectional data as opposed to
longitudinal data. Still, although longitudinal data is useful in studying long-term effects, it is also
important to focus on a central time period in which certain processes occur.
4.2. Policy Implications
The policy implications that can be derived from this exploratory study largely pertain to the
consideration of social context in the process of implementing community-oriented policing
practices, especially in small cities which might not be as diversified as their counterparts. However,
what has become overwhelmingly evident from this present study is that COP implementation,
whether examined in a singular manner or as a composite measurement, holds very little predictive
power in the context of crime rates. Instead it is clear that some determinants of social disorganization
may impact the success of community-policing strategies or prevent them from reaching statistical
significance within the models.
As stated by Hughes and Rowe (2007), the community is at the heart of not only political policies
but also those involving policing. With this in mind, the central focus of police departments
implementing COP should be on improving social controls through the increase of police legitimacy
(i.e., increase faith in police) and the decrease in fear of crime. If a disjuncture exists between
community members and local police, negative perceptions towards police could persist despite their
best efforts (Bain et al. 2014). This gap can be filled if opportunities are provided for communities to
be actively involved in implementing community-oriented, strategies rather than merely being
informed of the types of community policing initiatives that exist (Kerley and Benson 2000).
In a study focused on community members' perceptions of police, Crichlow and McGarrell
(2015) highlighted the significance of both proper police treatment and quality of police performance
on police legitimacy. Not only are members of communities that lack the necessary trust in authority
more inclined to disobey the law (Sunshine and Tyler 2003), these communities also generally lack
stable social controls that can further impact the success of COP implementation (Warner et al. 2010).
For COP implementation to thrive effectively, community-policing officers must recognize that
varied community constituencies (i.e., individual citizens, business associations) bring differing
perspectives and ideas to the overall discussion on local problems (Lab 2003). Without the
cooperation of both community members and COP officers, problem-solving strategies may not
properly target the real issues that communities face. In a study involving the Los Angeles Police
Department, many officers within the community police unit admitted to being unaware of what the
philosophy specifically entailed or required of them (Glen et al. 2003). Considering the inclusion of
training in the implementation process of COP, this should never be the case. However, as noted by
Lab (2003) this lack of understanding is the result of the amount of weight still placed on taking
reports, criminal codes, making arrests and other similar tasks, whereas more emphasis should
instead be placed on problem-solving, identifying intervention strategies and community advocacy.
In addition, the inherent challenges of policing predominantly Black or African American
communities cannot be overlooked. Although the argument that racial disparities do not exist within
policing is untenable, based on the findings of this study it would be unreasonable to suggest that all
small cities with a higher percentage of Black or African American individuals are prone to a higher
range of crime rates. Policy should focus on the organizational culture within police departments and
prioritize police legitimacy in order to address issues in police-citizen conflict.

5. Conclusions: Directions for Future Research
To address measurement issues and to translate implementation efforts into comparable data
across agencies, we recommend that more rigorous research should be conducted with a small
sample of police agencies to assess variation in implementation strategies. Although LEMAS
provides data on various aspects of policing, the community-policing portion of the survey does not
provide a clear picture of an agency's level of implementation. In addition, there is a need to evaluate
officer outlook on the community policing philosophy itself. Research has demonstrated the
importance of officer perception and its linkage to community-oriented policing effectiveness
(Connell et al. 2008; Sadd and Grinc 1994). As stated by Lab (2003), most crime prevention programs
such as COP are heavily reliant on support and input from law enforcement personnel.
Although the implementation process is not standard, there is a degree of consistency in regard
to the overarching concept of community-oriented policing. Community policing models
implemented within agencies can help to define roles for officers to ensure effective and consistent
implementation. Whether proper training is provided is another important concern. Graziano et al.
(2013) note that training is the primary vehicle through which change in American policing is
orchestrated, yet very little controlled research has been conducted on the subject. We agree that
research on training effectiveness, especially in the implementation of such strategies, must be further
examined.
We must also ask whether grouping all five of the implementation variables into an index
variable provided insight into the nuances of COP. Future research must consider going beyond
broad terms and examine whether the pairing or grouping of selected strategies may be more
beneficial to some locales. This could be managed through conjunctive analysis techniques, which
would represent all possible combinations of implementation that could be observed simultaneously
(Hart and Miethe 2011). This might also shed light on the compatibility of particular strategies and
whether or not such strategies may be contradictory to the needs of the community.
Regarding social disorganization theory, future research should aim to incorporate the full
model of the theory. This would require emphasis on intervening variables and measurement of
social cohesion and friendship networks among other variables. As noted by Kerley and Benson
(2000), when linking the social disorganization theory to community policing implementation, there
is a need for additional measures of community characteristics or processes to be tested in various
settings with a rich variety of COP strategies.
The continuing interest in policing strategies and crime control is likely to develop more insight
into unanswered questions regarding community-level explanations of crime. The null findings
concerning COP implementation within this study and others are therefore not disheartening but
instead are a part of an empirical process of trial and error. What is evident, however, is that
population or community demographics play a salient role, not only in the implementation process,
but ultimately on the success of community-oriented policing. Therefore, law enforcement agencies
might consider the social context of the communities they serve and implement policing strategies
that are tailored with these characteristics in mind. While community policing's impact on crime is
inconclusive (Gill et al. 2014; Sozer and Merlo 2013), research pertaining to policing and community
relations is still needed. Given the current state of policing, and questions pertaining to police
legitimacy, police should be encouraged to build stronger relationships with the public, and law
enforcement agencies are encouraged to also take community factors into account when
implementing COP.
