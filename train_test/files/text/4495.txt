Forgiveness is a funny thing. It warms the heart and cools the
sting.
--William Arthur Ward
Ward's quote suggests that forgiveness can not only
induce positive feelings, but alleviate the psychological pain
resulting from an interpersonal transgression. Although
Ward was perhaps speaking metaphorically, there is a sub-
stantial body of research linking forgiveness to physical and
physiological well-being (e.g., Hannon, Finkel, Kumashiro,
& Rusbult, 2012; Lawler et al., 2003; Pargament & Rye,
1998; Witvliet, Ludwig, & VanderLaan, 2001; Worthington,
Witvliet, Pietrini, & Miller, 2007). While forgiving is known
to reduce negative feelings, resentment, and vindictive moti-
vations toward a transgressor (Worthington, 2006;
Worthington et al., 2007), much less is known about the rela-
tionship between forgiveness and negative affect more gen-
erally. It is important to fill this gap in the literature, because
the nature of this relationship has important implications for
not only how forgiveness is conceptualized, but also for
understanding its origins.
Our primary objective in this research is to explore the
reciprocal relationship between negative affect and forgive-
ness--specifically, to test whether experiencing a negative
affective state increases the likelihood of forgiveness, and
whether forgiving can reduce negative affect. After a brief
literature review, we present a series of studies designed to
answer three questions about the relationship between nega-
tive affect and forgiveness: First, are people in a negative
mood more likely to forgive a hypothetical transgressor?
Second, what is the affective range in which this effect occurs
(i.e., does it occur with minor, moderate, and/or extreme bad
moods)? Third, can forgiving improve a negative mood? In
answering these questions, we aim to contribute to the for-
giveness literature by expanding the range of constructs
known to affect (and be affected by) forgiveness, advance
the debate on whether forgiveness is altruistic, and to con-
tribute to the discussion of the origins and purposes of
forgiveness.
Forgiveness has traditionally been defined via dictionar-
ies as ceasing to feel anger or resentment against an offender,
or forgoing a desire for revenge or restitution for a wrongdo-
ing (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2011). We, how-
ever, utilize the empirical and theoretically derived definition
of forgiveness as a prosocial process whereby negative,

A Function of Forgiveness: Exploring
the Relationship Between Negative
Mood and Forgiving

Abstract
Over the past two decades, researchers have described many facets of forgiveness. Presently, we explore the mood regulatory
properties of forgiveness. The mental and physical health benefits associated with forgiveness are well documented, and it
has been suggested that these benefits may be due to the negative affect regulating properties of forgiveness. However,
the relationship between forgiveness and negative affect has not been studied experimentally. We conducted three studies
designed to explore the relationship between mood and forgiveness. Results showed that participants induced with a
negative mood were more likely to forgive a hypothetical transgression than those in a neutral mood, a moderate level of
negativity was associated with a greater likelihood of forgiveness, and participants who forgave a hypothetical transgression
experienced less negative affect than participants who did not forgive. Implications of the present results and directions for
future research are discussed.

resentment-based thoughts, emotions, and motivations
toward a transgressor are reduced (Rusbult, Hannon, Stocker,
& Finkel, 2005; Worthington, 2005; Worthington et al.,
2007). This definition provides distinction from similar, but
non-forgiveness-related constructs (such as pardoning, rec-
onciling, condoning, forgetting, and excusing) while tapping
into the motivational components of forgiveness
(McCullough & Witvliet, 2001). Theoretically, forgiveness
has been conceptualized as a transition from negative to pos-
itive affect, feelings, and behaviors toward a transgressor
over time (Enright & The Human Development Study Group,
1991; McCullough, Pargament, & Thoresen, 2000). We
argue that this affective transition need not be restricted to a
specific target (i.e., a transgressor), but can occur more gen-
erally as well. Specifically, we suggest that the tendency to
forgive is enhanced by negative affect, and that the act of
forgiving can alleviate or lessen a negative moodstate.
We focus on two important conceptualizations of mood.
First, mood is a person's ephemeral, subjectively perceived
affective state (Isen, Clark, & Schwartz, 1976). Second,
mood is not directed at a specific person or situation (namely,
the transgressor or the transgression; Clark & Isen 1982).
There are theoretical grounds on which to hypothesize that
experiencing a negative mood will increase the likelihood of
forgiveness. The foundation of this supposition is that people
are motivated to improve or repair a bad mood (Wegner &
Pennebaker, 1993). Many of our behaviors and thoughts are
rooted in the simple motivation to experience more positive
than negative affect (Larsen, 2000). These behaviors need
not necessarily be conscious or explicit. We describe some
possible mechanisms through which the experience of a neg-
ative mood should increase the likelihood of forgiving.
People can improve a negative moodstate by pursuing
strategies such as helping others or behaving prosocially.
According to the negative state relief model, when people
experience negative affect or emotions, they will behave in a
prosocial manner in an attempt to repair their mood (Cialdini,
Darby, & Vincent, 1973). Since its inception, numerous stud-
ies have supported the model (e.g., Cialdini & Kenrick,
1976; Cialdini et al., 1987). The generally accepted idea
espoused by Isen (1984; Clark & Isen, 1982) and later echoed
and amplified by Taylor (1991) is that positive affective
states will be sought and maintained, whereas negative affec-
tive states will be avoided or repaired. The prosocial motiva-
tional component of forgiveness (e.g., McCullough, Fincham,
& Tsang, 2003; McCullough et al., 1998) should render it a
viable strategy for mood reparation or improvement.
Furthermore, Morris (1992) suggested that moods serve
as an indicator of what is wrong or right with one's internal
systems, and those systems can be regulated by altering or
changing the environment (Larsen, 2000). Negative moods
suggest the presence of a stressor (Eckenrode, 1984), signal-
ing the need for its elimination via environmental change.
This type of regulatory behavior may explain the mental and
physical health benefits of forgiveness. For instance,
less forgiving individuals displayed stronger sympathetic
nervous system activation and stress reactions than those
who are more forgiving (Witvliet et al., 2001). Forgiving
individuals also report better mental health than those who
are unforgiving, including employment of better coping
strategies (Pargament & Rye, 1998) and reports of greater
life satisfaction (Maltby, Day, & Barber, 2004). Given the
robust stress-reducing properties of forgiveness (Lawler et
al., 2003), we suggest it is a likely candidate for the type of
affect regulation mentioned hereinbefore. If this is the case,
individuals in a negative mood should be more likely to for-
give (given the opportunity) than individuals who are in a
neutral mood.
Study 1
Overview
In Study 1, we experimentally manipulated mood to test the
impact that a negative mood has on forgiveness likelihood.
Given the stress- and negative affect­reducing properties of
forgiveness coupled with the principles of negative state
relief, we predict that participants induced with a negative
mood will be more likely to forgive relative to those in a
control condition (Hypothesis 1).
We also note that the relationship between personality and
forgiveness has been extensively documented, revealing that
forgiveness is positively related to agreeableness (Berry,
Worthington, Parrott, O'Connor, & Wade, 2001; Brose, Rye,
Lutz-Zois, & Ross, 2005) and negatively related to neuroti-
cism (Berry et al., 2001). The relationship between conscien-
tiousness and forgiveness is less well-established, with some
researchers reporting a relationship between the two con-
structs (Balliet, 2010; Berry et al., 2001), and others report-
ing a weak or nonexistent relationship (e.g., Brose et al.,
2005; Walker & Gorsuch, 2002). As such, we measure agree-
ableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness to control for
these factors in Study 1.
Method
Participants.We recruited 414 (160 males, 254 females)
undergraduate students from a large Southwestern university
who participated for partial course credit. To avoid problems
associated with too much or too little statistical power, we
encourage focus on effect size figures not affected by sample
size, including Cohen's d and regression betas. We addition-
ally report conventional p values, per American Psychologi-
cal Association (APA) guidelines. Ethnic makeup of the
sample was 40% White, 49% Hispanic or Latino, and 11% of
other or unspecified ethnicity. Mean participant age was 19.5
years.
Materials. The survey packet contained a demographic sur-
vey, a personality measure, a mood manipulation, and the
Marks et al. 3
dependent forgiveness measure. The personality measures
consisted of the agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neu-
roticism scales from the Big-5 Personality Inventory (BFI;
John, Donahue, & Kentle, 1991). The mood manipulation
consisted of a set of news headlines established as effective
by Trafimow, Bromgard, Finlay, and Ketelaar (2005). The
neutral headlines consisted of news stories about an airport
and a restaurant, and the negative headlines consisted of sto-
ries about a nation's rampant starvation and a school shoot-
ing. Participants in the neutral and negative conditions read
the respective set of headlines. To ensure participants read
and understood the headlines, they were asked to write a one-
or two-sentence summary of the headlines immediately after
reading each one.
The dependent measure was the 10-item Forgiveness
Likelihood Scale (FLS; Rye et al., 2001), in which respon-
dents are instructed to imagine that they have experienced a
variety of transgressions, and then indicate the likelihood that
they would forgive the transgressor in each case. Sample items
include, "A friend borrows your most valued possession, and
then loses it. The friend refuses to replace it. What is the likeli-
hood that you would choose to forgive your friend?" and "A
stranger breaks into your house and steals a substantial sum of
money from you. What is the likelihood that you would choose
to forgive the stranger?" The scale uses a 5-point Likert-type
format ranging from not at all likely to extremely likely, with
higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of forgiving. The
FLS was chosen due to an optimum balance of brevity, sound
psychometric properties, adequate reliability, and strong con-
vergent validity with other established measures of forgive-
ness (including the 60-item Enright Forgiveness Inventory
[EFI; Subkoviak
et al., 1995], which measures positive and negative affect,
cognitions, and behavior toward an offender; Rye et al., 2001).
Procedure. On arrival to the lab, an experimenter gave par-
ticipants a short overview of the study. After granting con-
sent, participants read and summarized the condition-specific
set of headlines, then completed the forgiveness measure. On
completing the study, participants were fully debriefed,
thanked, and dismissed.
Results and Discussion
In the present sample, reliability for the FLS was adequate
(Cronbach's  = .82). In the main analysis, an independent-
samples t test on FLS scores was conducted. As predicted,
participants in the negative mood condition (M = 2.82, SD =
0.72) were more likely to forgive than those in the neutral
mood condition (M = 2.67, SD = 0.65), t(412) = 2.19, p = .03,
d = .22, supporting Hypothesis 1 (see Table 1). Participant
sex was not related to FLS scores.
Analysis of the personality variables revealed that forgive-
ness likelihood was negatively correlated with neuroticism
(r = -.18. p < .001), positively correlated with agreeableness
(r = .21. p < .001), and uncorrelated with conscientiousness
(see Table 2).As such, we performed a supplementary analysis
to test the effects of the mood manipulation while controlling
for personality and other demographic variables. After con-
firming there were no violations of linearity, normality, and
multicollinearity, a simultaneous regression was performed,
with FLS score regressed on mood, personality (neuroticism
and agreeableness), and demographic variables (ethnicity, age,
and sex). The overall model explained approximately 7% of
the variance in forgiveness likelihood, R2 = .07, F(6, 407) =
14.15, p < .001. Mood and both personality variables predicted
tendency to forgive (see Table 3), suggesting that participants'
mood affected their tendency to forgive independent of per-
sonality and demographics. A subsequent hierarchical regres-
sion analysis on the same six predictors revealed no higher
order interactions between mood and any of the predictors.
The results of Study 1 support our hypothesis that the
induction of a negative mood would lead to a greater likeli-
hood of forgiving.Although this finding supports our hypoth-
eses and establishes causation, the study has two limitations.

First, the affective experience felt by the participants in the
negative condition may have been closer to an emotional
experience (resulting from the negatively valanced stimuli)
rather than a more general affective state. Second, although
we ensured participants read and understood the mood
manipulation, we did not conduct a more overt manipulation
check (out of concern that the manipulation check would
prime mood) to ensure the participants were actually experi-
encing a negative mood. To address these two limitations, we
conducted a quasi-experimental study designed to capture
the likelihood of forgiving across a more naturally occurring
(i.e., nonmanipulated) range of moods.
Because the disposition to forgive is negatively related to
anger and hostility (Tangney, Fee, Reinsmith, Boone, & Lee,
1999), we predict that the effects of mood on forgiveness
will be most robust at slight or moderate levels of negativity.
Specifically, Tangney et al.'s (1999) finding suggests that
forgiveness is not likely at high levels of negative affect.
Based on this finding and the results of Study 1, it is unclear,
then, whether the relationship between negative mood and
forgiveness likelihood is strongest at low or moderate levels
of negativity. If the effect is most robust at a low level of
negative affect, the regression will reveal either a negative
linear or a concave down J-shaped function (Hypothesis 2a)
peaking at the low end of the negativity dimension. If the
effect is most robust at a moderate level of negative affect,
the regression will reveal a concave down, U-shaped func-
tion (Hypothesis 2b) peaking near the center of the negativity
distribution. Although we do not make predictions related to
positive affect, we include positive affect in the analyses for
exploratory purposes.
Study 2
Method
Participants.We recruited 67 (22 males, 43 females, 2
unspecified) undergraduate students from a large Southwest-
ern university who participated for partial course credit. Eth-
nic makeup of the sample was 26% Caucasian, 58% Hispanic/
Latino, and 16% of other or unspecified ethnicity. Mean par-
ticipant age was 19.4 years.
Measures. We assessed mood with the 20-item Positive and
Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Telle-
gen, 1988). The PANAS features 10 positive and 10 negative
feelings with instructions to indicate the degree to which the
respondent is experiencing each feeling at that very moment.
The dependent measure was the FLS, and the dependent
variable was the FLS score. We counterbalanced the order of
issue of the FLS and PANAS across participants. Participants
also provided demographic information.
Procedure. On arrival to the lab, participants received a brief,
nonspecific overview of the study and granted informed
consent. Participants then completed the survey packet and
were subsequently thanked, debriefed, and dismissed.
Results and Discussion
Reliabilities for the FLS and PANAS positive and negative
scales were adequate (Cronbach's  = .80, .90, and .82,
respectively). After confirming there were no violations of
normality and multicollinearity, we conducted a hierarchical
polynomial regression with the FLS mean as the outcome
variable. To test for hypothesized curvilinear relationship,
we entered linear (Step 1) and quadratic (Step 2) terms for
both PANAS dimensions into the equation. In Step 1, the
model explained 2% of the variance in FLS scores. In Step 2,
adding the quadratic terms resulted in an 11% increase in
variance explained, F
change
(2, 62) = 3.91, p = .025, R2 = .11.
The final model thus explained 13% of the variance in FLS
scores, F(4, 62) = 2.27, p = .072, R2 = .13. The negative qua-
dratic term entered in Step 2 was significant, B = -0.68, t(62)
= -2.75, p = .008. See Table 4 for regression coefficients.
These results reveal a concave down U-shaped function,
with forgiveness likelihood peaking near 2 of the negative
PANAS distribution (responses ranged from 1 to 3.2), sup-
porting Hypothesis 2b and failing to support Hypothesis 2a
(which predicted a negative linear or a concave down,
J-shaped function, which the data did not fit).
The results of Study 2 further support our claim that nega-
tive affect is positively related to forgiveness. Furthermore,
the fact that mood was not experimentally manipulated sup-
ports the claim that sadness or anger that might have resulted
from the negative condition stimuli did not drive the effect
found in Study 1. The final question we aim to answer is that
of whether forgiving can reduce negative affect. To answer
this question, we measured participants' baseline mood,
instructed them to forgive or not to forgive, and then mea-
sured their mood postmanipulation. Given our earlier discus-
sion of the well-documented health benefits associated with
forgiving, we predict that participants who forgive will expe-
rience a reduction in (or comparatively less) negative affect
Marks et al. 5
relative to participants who do not forgive (Hypothesis 3).
Although we do not make predictions related to positive
affect, we include positive affect in the analyses for explor-
atory purposes.
Study 3
Method
Participants. We recruited 122 (40 males, 80 females, 2 not
specified) undergraduate students from a large Southwestern
university who participated for partial course credit. Ethnic
makeup of the sample was 43% White, 45% Hispanic/Latino,
and 13% of other or unspecified ethnicity. Mean participant
age was 19.3 years.
Measures.Mood was assessed with the PANAS. A demo-
graphics section was included. The forgiveness manipulation
consisted of a single item worded as follows (unforgiving
text in brackets):
Please read the following situation, and try to imagine how you
would feel if it happened to you:
Your friend asks to borrow 250 dollars to pay off a debt. You tell
him or her you cannot afford that much, but you give him or her
50 dollars. The next morning, you find that some of your
belongings are missing. It turns out your friend took them and
sold them to pay off the debt.
Imagine that that person who did this asked for your forgiveness.
Suppose that you decide [not] to forgive the person.Take a
moment to imagine yourself forgiving him or her [denying
him or her forgiveness]. How would the person ask? What
would you say? What would you feel? Take a minute or two
to write about what you think this would be like.
Procedure.On arrival to the lab, a researcher gave partici-
pants an overview of the study, obtained informed consent,
and randomly assigned participants to read the vignette with
instructions to either imagine forgiving or not forgiving the
transgressor. Participants then completed a demographics
section, completed the premanipulation PANAS, responded
to the forgiveness manipulation, and finally completed the
postmanipulation PANAS. After completing the study, par-
ticipants were thanked, debriefed, and dismissed.
Results and Discussion
Reliability coefficients for pre- and postmanipulation posi-
tive ( = .86, .89, respectively) and negative ( = .76, .80,
respectively) PANAS scores were adequate. We initially con-
ducted two independent-samples t tests comparing pre- and
postmanipulation negative and positive scores. See Table 5 for
descriptive statistics. There were no differences between the
negative (d = .09) or positive (d = -.16) premanipulation
scores of the forgiveness and nonforgiveness groups.
Regarding the postmanipulation negative scale scores, par-
ticipants who forgave reported marginally less negative
affect (M = 1.53, SD = .45) than those who did not forgive
(M = 1.70, SD = .57), t(120) = 1.82, p = .07, d = .33. There
were no differences in postmanipulation positive scores
between the two groups (d = -.27, ns).
We also compared pre- and postforgiveness scores within
condition to assess the degree of affective change associated
with forgiving and not forgiving. For participants who did
not forgive, positive PANAS scores decreased postmanipula-
tion, t(124) = -2.30, p = .02, d = -.42. Negative PANAS
scores did not change (see Figure 1).
Two noteworthy effects occurred in Study 3. First, in par-
tial support of Hypothesis 3, participants who forgave
reported marginally less negative affect than those who did
not forgive. Second, regarding within-condition change, par-
ticipants who did not forgive reported a significant decrease
in positive affect following the manipulation.
At face value, the first finding implies that those who for-
give will, after the decision point (of deciding to forgive or
not), experience less negative affect than those who do not
forgive. To more fully understand this effect, we must con-
sider how the PANAS scores changed from pre- to postma-
nipulation. Participants who did not forgive experienced a

decrease in positive affect from baseline. In sum, the results
of Study 3 suggest that the effect of forgiveness on affect is
twofold: Forgiveness reduces negative affect more than not
forgiving, while simultaneously buffering against decreases
in positive affect following a decision not to forgive.
General Discussion
Despite an increase in forgiveness research in the last two
decades, the relationship between mood and forgiveness is still
ambiguous. The primary objective of the present research was
to address this gap in the literature by exploring the mood regu-
latory properties of forgiveness. In Study 1, participants induced
with a negative mood were more likely to forgive compared
with participants in a neutral mood. In Study 2, participants
experiencing a moderate amount of negative affect were most
likely to forgive. In Study 3, participants instructed to forgive a
hypothetical offense reported marginally less negative affect
than those who did not forgive, and did not experience a reduc-
tion in positive as did participants instructed not to forgive.
Overall, effect sizes in the present research were small.
Altogether, the present results help support the claim that
forgiveness has mood regulatory properties. This claim is
compatible with theorizing that forgiveness is rooted in emo-
tions (e.g., Worthington & Wade, 1999). Worthington and
Scherer (2004) described a process called emotional forgive-
ness whereby the construct known as unforgiveness (the
composite of negative emotions, feelings, and motivations
toward a transgressor) is replaced with positive, other-ori-
ented emotions like empathy or compassion (Worthington,
Sandage, & Berry, 2000; Worthington & Wade, 1999).
Unforgiveness is characterized as a stress reaction (Harris &
Thoresen, 2005; Worthington & Scherer, 2004), potentially
having health consequences similar to those caused by
chronic stress (see Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, & Miller, 2007).
Thus, one implication of the present results is that the stress-
reducing capabilities of forgiveness may extend beyond the
alleviation of transgressor-focused stressors, and apply to
stressors more generally.
The conceptualization of forgiveness as having mood
regulatory capabilities raises the question of the primary
function of forgiveness: Is forgiveness primarily a means of
repairing relationships through the overcoming of transgres-
sions, or is it a self-preservation mechanism? In other words,
do people forgive others because of primarily relational and
personal reasons? Or do people forgive as a more implicit
means of regulating their stress levels and maintaining their
physical health? Although we note that these two functions
need not be mutually exclusive, the veracity of the latter
explanation is supported by the present results. This has
implications for evolutionary perspectives on forgiveness.
Most contemporary evolutionary perspectives on forgive-
ness focus on the adaptive behavioral advantages offered by
forgiveness, such as choosing the optimal response following a
transgression (Godfray, 1992), or curtailing an escalating series
of retaliations that might otherwise result in death or grievous
injury to one or all parties involved (see Enright, 1996;
McCullough, Kurzban, & Tabak, 2010; Newberg, d'Aquili,
Newberg, & deMarici, 2000). However, another possible adap-
tive advantage of forgiveness is better health via the reduction of
internal stressors. The suppressive effects of chronic stress on
the immune system are well documented (see Segerstrom &
Miller, 2004). Indeed, state forgiveness (the act of forgiving) is
correlated with reduced stress and negative affect (Lawler et al.,
2005). The present results lend experimental support to these
findings, strengthening the claim that forgiveness offers better
health via the reduction of stress reactions, not only in response
to an offense, but more generally as well. In sum, forgiveness
may not only have been physically adaptive in the environment
of evolutionary adaptedness, but physiologically as well, bene-
fits which continue today.
Taken as a whole, the body of empirical evidence gath-
ered thus far raises the question of whether forgiveness is
altruistic or egoistic. Some researchers have argued against
the possibility of there being "true" altruism, as there are
generally self-rewards (e.g., good feelings, avoiding nega-
tive feelings such as guilt) that occur whenever a person
helps or assists others (see Batson, 1998, for a review). Our
results suggest that the primary (or at least much of the) ben-
efit in forgiving may be for the actor, and not the recipient of
forgiveness. If one strictly defines altruism as selfless behav-
ior with no benefits for the actor, it is logically impossible to
define forgiveness as altruistic. Even if one defines altruism
in a less absolute sense, such as a behavior in which the ben-
efits for the recipient outweigh or are greater than those
gained by the actor, it still may be a philosophical and empir-
ical challenge to declare forgiveness as altruistic.
In summary, the present results contribute to the concep-
tualization of forgiveness as a rich, multifaceted system of
behaviors, thoughts, and motivations that impact and interact
with many areas of human life. In the debate concerning the
nature, function, and purpose of forgiveness, there may be
veracity toward most, if not all, of the ways that forgiveness
has been theoretically conceptualized.

Limitations and Directions for Future Research
Although the present research provides a novel perspective
with which to study forgiveness, there are several limitations
that future research might address. The survey-based, hypo-
thetical nature of the present research lacks context that may
influence how individuals think about and cope with actual
transgressions and transgressors. The severity of an offense,
for instance, may be a strong determinant of whether forgive-
ness is granted. Other important factors may include the
quality and nature of the relationship between the transgres-
sor and the victim, the amount of time that has passed since
the transgression, and the victim's subjective perception of
the offense. All of these factors may interact with each other
to varying degrees as well. Future research should examine
the degree to which these factors mediate or moderate the
mood effects reported in the present research.
A further limitation of the present research was that the
results were generally characterized by small effect sizes.
One possible reason for this outcome is that the PANAS is a
general measure of affect positivity and negativity. Such a
measure may not fully tap into the mechanisms responsible
for the effects in the present research. Future research might
make use of more specific or specialized affect scales, such
as the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule­Extended
Form (PANAS-X; Watson & Clark, 1994), which measures
11 specific affects in addition to the two original higher order
dimensions, or a specialized negative affect scale such as the
State­Trait Anger Scale (STAS; Spielberger, Jacobs, Russell,
& Crane, 1983). Also related to the measures, the FLS and
the scenario in Study 3 contained hypothetical situations that
may not have had the same impact as a genuine transgres-
sion. Asking participants to recall genuine transgressions
that they have actually experienced may result in stronger
effects, as well as increase internal and ecological validity.
Finally, our hypothesis that negative affect would be
reduced by forgiving was not supported. There are at least
three plausible reasons for this lack of support. First, it is
possible that, beyond being instructed to do so, participants
lacked motivation to forgive, thus attenuating any possible
effects of forgiveness. Second, it is possible that a floor effect
was present, whereby participants felt, on average, a low
amount of negative affect before being presented with the
scenario. Finally, perhaps a hypothetical transgression was
not sufficiently strong to elicit the predicted effect. We felt
using the hypothetical example was justified by the control it
allowed us to exert over the experiment (i.e., all participants
received a consistent stimulus). Future research should fea-
ture genuine, participant-generated transgressions, while
controlling for such factors as the severity of offense and the
participants' relationship with the transgressor.
In conclusion, let us restate that the act of forgiveness
clearly has many benefits, among them the reparation and
maintenance of relationships (McCullough, Worthington, &
Rachal, 1997), better physical and mental health (Pargament
& Rye, 1998; Witvliet et al., 2001), and a higher degree of
life satisfaction (Maltby et al., 2004). However, all of the
mechanisms through which these benefits are reached have
yet to be uncovered. The various factors involved may be
processed by the victim of a transgression, allowing him or
her to make the best judgment possible when deciding
whether to forgive an offender. It is our contention that one
function of forgiveness is an unconscious motivation stem-
ming from the desire to reduce or eliminate negative affect.
Our results suggest that there is a small yet reliable relation-
ship between mood and forgiveness. We hope that the pres-
ent research serves as an inspirational early step in the
exploration of this phenomenon, and that it presents new
opportunities to understand the nature, purposes, and out-
comes of forgiveness.
