Inclusive Services for Children and Families
From CaLD Backgrounds in an Australian
Context
Margaret Sims1, Anna Targowska2, Judy Kulisa2, and Susan Teather2
Abstract
The current Australian government is proposing an agenda focused around social inclusion in an attempt to address the
complex issues associated with inequality evident in this country. Despite valiant attempts, many agencies struggle to offer
inclusive services, particularly to families who have migrated to Australia from culturally and linguistically diverse (CaLD)
backgrounds. In this study, we surveyed a range of programs identified by key informants as offering inclusive service
delivery with the aim of identifying those aspects of their practice they believed facilitated successful inclusion. We then
attempt to position our findings within recently emerging critiques of the concept of social inclusion, of which our
participants appeared unaware. This critique addresses the fundamental purpose of social inclusion, and the strategies
commonly used to achieve it, arguing that these are based on a deficit approach that positions those who are excluded as
"other." In identifying those who are excluded as "other" and attempting to include them into a hegemonic idea of civil
society as functioning citizens, are agencies actually being racist?

Introduction
Inclusive practices in services for children and families from
CaLD backgrounds need to follow a number of principles to
address these children and families' complex needs. It will be
argued here, that these principles should be grounded in
recognition, and a sound understanding of discrimination and
social oppression to which these members of our society are
exposed. They should also be informed by a value position
within which diversity is acknowledged and celebrated, and
where beliefs and practices different from one's own are held
in high esteem (as originally defined by Sims, Guilfoyle,
Kulisa, Targowska, & Teather, 2008).
This article discusses a research project that was contracted
to develop a resource paper to guide practice positioned within
the Australian government's social inclusion agenda. We argue
that the Gillard government's social inclusion agenda at that
time was influencing the thinking behind provision of services
for children and families from CaLD backgrounds and that a
general acceptance of an understanding of social inclusion in
the government's agenda (Australian Social Inclusion Board,
2011) as something that is "incontestably good" (Edwards,
2008) needs to be considered critically.
Background
Social inclusion is often defined by its obverse, social
exclusion, on the assumption that social inclusion is what
social exclusion is NOT. Exclusion can be identified as
. . . a complex and multi-dimensional process. It involves the
lack, or denial of resources, rights, goods and services, and the
inability to participate in the normal relationships and activities
available to the majority of people in society, whether in
economic, social, cultural, or political arenas. It affects both the
quality of life of individuals and the equity and cohesion of
society as a whole. (Levitas et al., 2007, p. 9)
Drivers of social exclusion include poverty, low income
and income inequity, lack of access to employment, poor
educational outcomes, poor health and well-being, lack of
access to social supports and networks, exclusion from
services, and social isolation (Department of the Prime
Minister and Cabinet, 2010). When these risk factors
combine, they create a compounding experience of
disadvantage that is often self-reinforcing (Sims et al.,
2008), frequently transmitting across generations. Migrants
from CaLD backgrounds experience social exclusion in
Australia in most of these categories and therefore are at
risk of long-term and inter-generational exclusion.
Prejudice can contribute to minority status and result in
migrants being more commonly found among the most

disadvantaged groups in society (Hertzman, 2002).
Evidence demonstrates that racism against migrants often
contributes to lack of confidence that prevents active
involvement in the Australian community (Healy,
Hampshire, Ayres, Ellwood, & Mengede, 2007). As
migrants' qualifications are often not recognized, their
employment options become quite restricted (Sims et al.,
2008). They are commonly under-employed, or
unemployed. For example, analyses of the 2006 census data
(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008b) show that 66% of
Australians participate in the Australian workforce, but only
39.7% of those born in Iraq and 55.5% of those born in
China do so. Nearly 70% of Iraqi women are not
participating in the workforce. In 2006, the median
individual income for Australians who were born in China
was $AU239 per week compared with $AU484 for
Australian-born people. Nearly 36% of recent migrants
reported difficulty in obtaining employment. The most
commonly reported difficulties were lack of Australian
work experience or references (56%), language difficulties
(35%), and lack of local contacts and networks (29%;
Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008a).
The Australian federal government policy on social
inclusion (Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet,
2010) acknowledges the above concerns and is an attempt
to address the complex issues associated with inequality.
The government's aim is to create ". . . prosperity with
fairness . . ." which is to be achieved by the ". . . full social
and economic participation of all Australians" (Gillard,
2008, cited in Hayes, Gray, & Edwards, 2008, p. 9).
There is widespread acknowledgment that to address
social exclusion of migrant populations from CaLD
backgrounds, the helping professions need to examine new
approaches to working underpinned by the principle of
cultural competency (Bridging Refugee Youth & Children's
Services, 2002). We argue that past attempts to work with
those from minority backgrounds have not been successful
in addressing exclusion because
. . . the values, beliefs, meanings and practices from the
dominant culture are the benchmarks against which other
values and meanings are measured, and those outside these
mainstream constructs are deemed as inferior . . . terms such as
"capacity building" have currency, implying a deficit that
needs rectifying . . . Furthermore, contemporary manifestations
of racism include indifference to remediation of suffering, the
failure to commit adequate and appropriate resources, and the
refusal to acknowledge the wrongs and injustices perpetrated . .
.. (Briskman, 2008, pp. 86, 90)
Westoby (2008) also supports the need to rethink current
Australian practice. He reflects that, to successfully engage
CaLD groups in community development, he needed to ". .
. rethink practice, draw on new analyses and approach
practice in new ways" (p. 484). This article considers
potential "new ways" through an analysis of what our case
study agencies deemed as successful in delivering inclusive
services.
Method
The current article arose out of research undertaken on
behalf of the Australian Research Alliance for Children and
Youth (ARACY) that wished to produce a resource for
practitioners to support them in the development and
operation of programs to address the needs of children and
families from CaLD backgrounds in Australia. ARACY
tasked the research team with the responsibility of trying to
interpret theoretical discussions and reflections in the
literature, examine current inclusive practice through
multiple case studies to identify successful models and
strategies, and produce a topical article aimed at guiding
practitioners currently developing and/or working in new
programs. This resource is available on the ARACY
website (Sims et al., 2008). Subsequent to the publication of
the resource paper, the federal government released a range
of information briefs in relation to the national social
inclusion agenda, and these have been incorporated into our
thinking for the current article, extending the original
analysis through links to theory on social inclusion.
Given that the original brief for the research team was to
collect multiple case study information, we chose to use a
snowball sampling method to identify agencies delivering
inclusive services, considered by others to be successful, to
children and families from CaLD backgrounds across
Australia. In the context of this research, "success" is
defined as the creation of opportunities:
. . . to reach out to migrants, and when migrants are able to
respond to the invitation by engaging. Long term consequences
of such engagement are improved outcomes in CaLD families'
employment, education, housing and health. However,
connection to the new community and engagement in that new
community only occurs when appropriate supports are made
available to migrants. (Sims et al., 2008, p. 8)
We first established a Community Reference Group
consisting of key people working in agencies identified by
our funding body as successfully delivering inclusive
services. Members of our Community Reference Group
identified other agencies/programs they knew about across
Australia. We contacted these stakeholders and asked them
to recommend other services. We presented preliminary
results of the project on a nation-wide webinar set up
through our funding body, and participants in the webinar
were asked to identify agencies/programs that demonstrated
inclusive practice.
We then contacted each of the 65 identified
organizations by email with information about the research.
We received permission to proceed from 14 of them (we
were unable, under the conditions of our ethics approval to

follow up those who did not respond to our initial contact)
and undertook a semistructured interview. Case studies
were written up from the phone interviews and details
checked with the agency contact person. Finally, summaries
of the case studies were presented in our report to the
funding agency (Sims et al., 2008).
Data from the case studies were analyzed using a process
of constant comparison (Glaser, 1965; Miles & Huberman,
1994) to identify themes. We sought common themes
across the case studies and themes unique to specific cases.
We triangulated the data through reference to the literature
and through multiple analyses that were then compared for
accuracy.
Results and Discussion
Our participants universally identified three key elements of
high quality practice relating to inclusion (see Table 1). We
will address each of these in turn in the following
discussion. However, before we do so, we wish to begin
with our reflection on social inclusion itself: the goal
toward which they were all working.
Inclusion and Inclusive Practice
It is important to note that although the study participants
were not asked about their understanding of the concept of
social inclusion, in their comments about inclusive practice,
they appeared to accept the view that social inclusion is
incontestably beneficial and that all families want to be
included. Social inclusion and exclusion appeared to be
positioned as extremes on a continuum, and there was an
assumption that, as we aim for one end of the continuum
(inclusion), we will automatically have less exclusion:
The service identifies issues with an individual approach while
ensuring that each family's cultures and beliefs are respected,
but also linking each family into specific services or
organisations to improve their knowledge and social
integration within the local community. By providing this
support to each parent it begins to empower them which in turn
provides better and more inclusive outcomes for their children.
(Case Study 6)
However, Webb (2010) argues it is possible to think of
inclusion and exclusion in balance. Exclusion results when
one group closes off opportunities from another group in an
expression of the dominant ideology, and as ideologies
change, so do the groups that are excluded. The groups that
are excluded challenge this closure through a process
identified by Parkin (1979) as usurpation, attempting to
capture power from advantaged groups. This usurpation can
only arise within the excluded groups and, because it
challenges the existing social order, is often perceived as
revolutionary and illegal.
Resistance as a reaction to inclusion. Parkin's (1979)
revolutionary approach is reflected in the positioning made
by many of our participants of families who were not
engaged in their services; these families were identified by
them as "hard-to-reach" families. These were families with
whom, despite their best efforts, they struggled to engage.
In each case, participants discussed how they intensified
their efforts, doing more of the same as they tried to use the
strategies that had been successful with others. Participants
talked about identifying community leaders, engaging staff
from the same cultural background as disengaged families,
and doing all in their power to reach out and consult with
these families so they could offer appropriate services:
Within the community, asking people working with CaLD
community for contacts, following these up and beginning
relationships with key community participants was the pattern
of initial development. This included the local chief a highly
respected Samoan community leader. I had to earn his respect
and continued to meet with him regularly, updating my
progress. These links were based on personal connection,
relationship building, integrity and honesty. (Case Study 10)
Although it could be true that the disengagement of
some families could be a reflection of the system's inability
to meet their specific needs, this explanation is based on the
assumption underpinning the dominant discourse of social
inclusion: that all families WANT to be included. Given the
definition of social inclusion used above refers to inclusion
into the ". . . normal relationships and activities available to
the majority of people in society . . ." (Levitas et al., 2007,
p. 9), it is likely that some families may reject this and seek
to live differently.
Thus, another perspective could also be used to highlight
this. The alternative construction is that "hard-to-reach"
families are using disengagement as a strategy to demonstrate
their resistance. Webb (2006, 2010) suggests that in pursuing
a socially inclusive agenda, agencies are, in fact, undertaking
"normalization"1 (as originally defined by Wolfensberger,
1980): That is, that agencies are attempting to shape families
in ways that best fit their understanding of what a socially
4 SAGE Open
included citizen should be like. He argued that the daily
practices of families and individuals show their capacity for
reflective and creative action; that the everyday is the
individual's point of resistance to the dominance of the state.
Using this frame, "hard-to-reach" families are demonstrating
considerable reflexivity (as defined by Webb, 2006)2 in
managing a successful resistance of the hegemonic: They are
using their experiences of the world to create their own
understandings and behaviors. Their strength lies in their
silence, in their invisibility from the information-gathering
tools of the state. Because of this, Webb argues, their
everyday life is not at all captured in our understandings of
social exclusion. This implies the services offered by the state
are likely to be totally inappropriate, and there is little benefit
to such families in engaging.
Does this mean that social service agencies cannot
achieve the state's social inclusion goal as they act with
clients? Will services always find there are "hard-to-reach"
families who actively resist being brought into the
mainstream of society? Does this mean while WHO is in
these groups may change, there will always be such groups?
Does this mean that our services, with the best intention, are
fundamentally racist in that there is an unacknowledged
agenda to avoid addressing issues of power and inequality?
Capacity Building
Our participants used the concept of empowerment/capacity
building as a key building block in the way they
conceptualized their work:
As this is a support service more time can be given to each
family as they require, but the aim is to provide these families
with the tools to become confident and independent in gaining
the information they need and believing in the choices they
make. (Case Study 7)
The case study agencies acknowledged that such an
approach took time, and this was often problematic as
funding contracts were short-term and immediate results
impossible to demonstrate, thereby perpetuating an inability
for programs to demonstrate their success. As one
participant commented,
. . . as capacity is built, the family moves into another phase of
life . . . so after three years I have seen 2 cycles where the
Playgroup is built, established, creating their own reading and
language resources and then transitioning to school, leaving a
gap in the leadership and participation level at Playgroup, so
the cycle of capacity building begins again. With a timeline of
4 years, this project's time frame limits long term gains but
equally does provide an impetus to find other ways to embed
early childhood, and for me, emergent literacy frameworks,
within the . . . community. (Case Study 10)
Our reflection on this concept of capacity building takes
us back to our earlier discussion in relation to social
inclusion and resistance to social inclusion. The original
concept of empowerment by the Cornell Empowerment
Group (1989) focused on process rather than product:
The process is characterised by mutual respect and caring
between participants themselves, and between participants and
workers. It involves people who lack an equal share of
resources working together at the local community level to
develop greater access to resources. The central theme of
empowerment is that the very people who lack access to
resources, are the people who must be primarily responsible for
developing strategies to gain increased control. (Sims, 2002,
pp. 65-66)
More recent developments, and the use of the concept of
capacity building, tend to place more of a focus on product:
the capacity to participate in society. For example, in an
early definition, capacity building was positioned as "an
essential development intervention towards the
strengthening of civil society" (Eade, 1997, p. 2).
This brings with it implications that capacity building is
about supporting people to become what is needed to
maintain a civil society. All our reservations about the
purpose of social inclusion, and the strategies people
develop to resist social inclusion, thus become associated
with the concept of capacity building. As community
workers, are we in fact perpetuating racism in our focus on
capacity building when we fail to address the question,
"building capacity for what?"
Cultural Competence
A key element in the discourse of our participants is that of
cultural competence. Without exception, they argued that
their cultural competence is a key element in achieving
social inclusion for families from CaLD backgrounds.
Cultural competence as understood by our participants does
not require workers to become "experts" in any culture
represented in their client group. Instead, workers need to
understand there are always opportunities for
misunderstanding, and to actively listen and attempt to
establish shared understandings. In the words of one of our
participants, workers need to
... understand that there are multiple ways of seeing the world
and acting in it, and that all can be equally valued and
respected; that the worker's own individual values and beliefs
are no "better" (or "worse") than those held by anyone else.
(Sims et al., 2008, p. 26)
In more recent times, critiques of the concept of cultural
competency suggest that this is a form of "new racism"
(Pon, 2009), particularly because it positions individuals
from various cultural groups as "other" without questioning
the underlying power issues that result in that placement.
None of our participants was aware of the underlying
racism in this positioning, a circumstance not unexpected as
Sims et al. 5
the literature is clear that this thinking is often silenced,
marginalized (Augoustinos & Every, 2010), and hidden
(Durey, 2010). Instead, cultural competence is presented as
the framework for modern social work as it "constructs
knowledge about cultural `others' in a way that does not
challenge social workers' sense of innocence and
benevolence" (Pon, 2009, p. 66). Critiques of the concept of
cultural competence, and the identification of this as a racist
strategy, thus imply that, no matter how culturally
competent an agency might strive to be, it is ultimately
doomed to fail because the very manner in which it is trying
to address social inclusion is, in itself, flawed.
Integrated Service Delivery
A joined-up approach to service delivery is now widely
recognized and is part of the Australian Federal
Government's Social Inclusion focus (Hayes et al., 2008).
Our participants all argued that this is operationalized by
sharing information, trust in each other, and the breaking
down of traditional service boundaries between different
agencies. For example,
The project is working collaboratively with Case Study 4 . . .
(this organisation) has the resources to work with individual
CaLD families and to link them to services in the area--the
combination of both projects and the expertise has enabled the
two projects to achieve together what each on its own could not
have done. (Case Study 3)
Developing inter-agency partnerships, collaborative
working practices, and, ultimately, service integration
requires practitioners to recognize the role of trustworthy
relationships in their work: relationships between workers
and children/families/communities/other agencies. Such
relationships are difficult to establish and maintain, and
there are significant volumes of work now available
supporting practitioners to undertake this work (e.g.,
Anning, Cotrell, Frost, Green, & Robinson, 2010; Burton,
2012; Gasper, 2010; Mitchell, 2012; Murdoch Children's
Research Institute & Centre for Community Child Health,
2009). Evidence is clear that partnerships established with a
shared vision are more effective than those established for
expediency (Chen & Graddy, 2010) and that integration
requires strong leadership and adequate resourcing
(Phillips, Jones, & Head, 2010). However, arising from our
previous discussion, if each individual service fails to
address oppression and racism appropriately, will these
services, when they form a group of services operating in
partnership, exacerbate social exclusion?
Discussion--Ways Forward
Data for the project were gathered some time before the
publication of the federal government's social inclusion
agenda (Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet,
2010) and the reflective articles that accompanied in 2009
(see http://www.socialinclusion.gov.au/Documents).
Nevertheless, our participants' reflections and experience
help create an understanding of the practical context in
which the inclusion agenda was being operationalized in
Australia. At the same time, there is a growing critique of
social inclusion in general, and specifically its assumptions
that inclusion is ultimately good for all (Edwards, 2008).
The social inclusion agenda defines current social work
practice but is little theorized by its practitioners or by
policy makers. We show that our participants, in identifying
best practice, follow standard procedures that are well
reported in the literature and widely understood. However,
this understanding does not address the hidden and
unacknowledged racism underpinning their practice. We
hope that our positioning of these practices in a beginning
theoretical understanding might serve to prompt further
debate. We share with our participants the need to do the
best we can within the parameters in which we operate each
day. However, we also seek to expand our understandings
of social inclusion in the hope that our reflections may
contribute, in some small way in the long-term, to
improving outcomes for children and families. We suggest,
as have other authors (Augoustinos & Every, 2010; Berman
& Paradies, 2010; Durey, 2010; Pon, 2009), that as we
move forward, we will only achieve this end through a
process of committed, reflexive cooperation that is shared
across stakeholders. As suggested by Pon (2009), we need
to ". . . forgo the overambitious effort of trying to master
cultural content; instead [we] might focus on how
knowledge of `others' is constructed in the first instance"
(p. 68).

Notes
1. Normalization is defined by Wolfensberger (1980) as
"Utilisation of means which are as culturally normative as
possible, in order to establish, enable, or support behaviours,
appearances and interpretations which are as culturally
normative as possible" (p. 80).
2. Reflexivity as discussed by Webb (2006) is the process by
which individuals interpret their experiences based on their
experiences in the social world around them. Social practices
are ". . . made and unmade through the flows of social
exchange and the rich tapestry of fleeting transactions" (p. 30).
