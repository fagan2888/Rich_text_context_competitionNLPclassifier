OBJECTIVE -- Type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease are known to be associated, but the
temporality of this relationship has not been firmly established. We investigated whether base-
line periodontal disease independently predicts incident diabetes over two decades of follow-up.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 9,296 nondiabetic male and female
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) participants aged 25­74 years
who completed a baseline dental examination (1971­1976) and had at least one follow-up
evaluation (1982­1992) were studied. We defined six categories of baseline periodontal disease
using the periodontal index. Of 7,168 dentate participants, 47% had periodontal index  0
(periodontally healthy); the remaining were classified into periodontal index quintiles. Incident
diabetes was defined by 1) death certificate (ICD-9 code 250), 2) self-report of diabetes requiring
pharmacological treatment, or 3) health care facility stay with diabetes discharge code. Multiva-
riable logistic regression models assessed incident diabetes odds across increasing levels of
periodontal index in comparison with periodontally healthy participants.
RESULTS -- The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident diabetes in periodontal index cate-
gories 1 and 2 were not elevated, whereas the ORs in periodontal index categories 3 through 5
were 2.26 (95% CI 1.56­3.27), 1.71 (1.0­2.69), and 1.50 (0.99­2.27), respectively. The OR in
edentulous participants was 1.30 (1.00­1.70). Dentate participants with advanced tooth loss
had an OR of 1.70 (P  0.05) relative to those with minimal tooth loss.
CONCLUSIONS -- Baseline periodontal disease is an independent predictor of incident
diabetes in the nationally representative sample of NHANES I.

Type 2 diabetes is a significant public
health concern. The association be-
tween type 2 diabetes and periodon-
tal disease is well documented (1,2), and
periodontal disease has been traditionally
viewed solely as a pathological conse-
quence of diabetes (3). However, prospec-
tive data supporting this unidirectional
hypothesis are limited, and prevailing
views regarding associations between
periodontal disease and type 2 diabetes
should be informed by the growing body
of evidence suggesting periodontal dis-
ease as a risk factor for atherosclerotic car-
diovascular disease (CVD) (4­7).
Type 2 diabetes and CVD have com-
mon antecedents, and in view of the
American Heart Association's Scientific
Statement on Diabetes stating that "diabe-
tes is a cardiovascular disease" (8), it
seems reasonable to hypothesize peri-
odontal disease as a potential contributor
to development of type 2 diabetes. As
with CVD infection hypotheses, chronic
inflammation in response to periodontal
bacteria might link periodontal disease
and type 2 diabetes. Indeed, systemic in-
flammation has emerged as a novel pre-
dictor of type 2 diabetes (9,10), and
individuals with periodontal disease have
been consistently shown to exhibit ele-
vated levels of systemic inflammation (2).
Moreover, periodontal therapy has re-
sulted in changes in systemic monocytic
gene expression (11) and decreases in sys-
temic inflammation (12).
We are unaware of any studies that
have assessed the association between
baseline clinical periodontal disease and
risk of subsequent diabetes in an initially
diabetes-free cohort. Studies of this na-
ture are important as they can clarify the
temporality of periodontal disease/type 2
diabetes associations We hypothesized
that baseline periodontal disease pre-
dicted incident type 2 diabetes in the First
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES I) and its Epidemi-
ologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Details concerning the
design of NHANES I and NHEFS have
been published previously (5,13).
NHANES I was a national probability
sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.
population aged 1­74 years, conducted
during 1971­1974. NHEFS is a longitu-
dinal study including all individuals ini-
tially aged 25­74 years who completed a
medical examination in NHANES I (n 
14,407). The NHEFS comprises four lon-
gitudinal follow-up studies in 1982­
1984, 1986, 1987, and 1992. The 1986,
1987, and 1992 follow-ups used the same
design and data collection procedures de-
veloped in the 1982­1984 NHEFS, with
the exceptions that a 30-min computer-

assisted telephone interview was admin-
istered rather than a personal interview,
and no physical measurements were
taken during the 1986­1992 examina-
tions. The 1986 NHEFS was conducted
for members of the NHEFS cohort who
were aged 55­74 years at their baseline
examination and not known to be de-
ceased at the 1982­1984 NHEFS (n 
3,980). The 1987 (n  11,750) and 1992
(n  11,195) follow-ups were conducted
for the entire surviving cohort. Ninety-six
percent of the study population was suc-
cessfully traced at some point through the
1992 follow-up. Tracing rates for each
completed wave ranged from 90 to 94%,
and interview rates ranged from 91 to
96% of those traced.
The present analysis is derived from
11,375 participants who received a base-
line dental evaluation. Of these partici-
pants, 658 were lost to follow-up (94%
follow-up rate). An additional 1,421 par-
ticipants were excluded because of 1)
prevalent diabetes (n  570), 2) incident
diabetes reported within 1 year of base-
line (n  82) to minimize the prevalence
of undiagnosed baseline diabetes, or 3)
missing covariate data (n  769) for
smoking, physical activity, and/or educa-
tion, yielding a final sample of 9,296. All
9,296 participants included were traced
(vital status confirmed) at least once dur-
ing follow-up and 96% were traced at
each of four follow-up cycles. At the 10-
and 20-year follow-ups, 15% (n  1,363)
and 34% (n  3,129) of participants were
deceased, respectively.
Periodontal disease assessment
Dental examiners were trained to follow a
written set of objective standards to min-
imize examiner variability by eliminating
conditions known to be sources of dis-
agreement (14). The periodontal index
(15) was used to assess the presence/
absence of periodontal disease for each
tooth by assigning scores based on gingi-
val inflammation extent, the presence or
absence of periodontal pockets, and tooth
mobility as follows: 1) no periodontal dis-
ease (score  0): neither overt inflamma-
tion in the investing tissues nor loss of
function due to supporting tissue destruc-
tion; 2) mild gingivitis (score  1): an
overt area of inflammation in the free gin-
givae, not circumscribing the tooth; 3)
gingivitis (score  2): inflammation com-
pletely circumscribing the tooth with no
apparent break in the epithelial attach-
ment; 4) gingivitis with pocket formation
(score  6): epithelial attachment had
been broken and there was a pocket (not
merely a deepened gingival crevice due to
swelling in the free gingivae), there was
no interference with normal masticator
function, and the tooth was firm in its
socket and had not drifted; and 5) ad-
vanced destruction with loss of masticator
function (score  8): the tooth was either
loose, had drifted, or sounded dull on
percussion with a metallic instrument. If
the examiner was equivocal regarding the
appropriate score, the lesser score was as-
signed. All present teeth, excluding roots,
were scored. The periodontal index re-
flects the within-mouth arithmetic aver-
age of scores for all teeth (periodontal
index range is continuous from 0 to 8.0).
For dentate participants, each poten-
tial tooth in the dentition was classified as
being decayed (D), missing due to caries
(M), or filled without decay (F). These
values were summed per person to create
an index (DMF) reflective of historical
caries experience. The range of possible
values was 0 to 32.
Incident diabetes
Incident diabetes was defined by 1) death
certificate (ICD-9 code in the range of
250.0 to 250.9 or diabetes otherwise
listed on the death certificate), 2) self-
reported physician diagnosis requiring
pharmacological treatment (participants
reporting physician-diagnosed diabetes
and dietary intervention but not pharma-
cological intervention were not consid-
ered to have developed incident diabetes
to enhance outcome specificity), or 3)
health care facility stay with a discharge
diagnosis of diabetes.
Covariate data collection
Potential confounding variables related to
diabetes risk and/or indicative of healthy
lifestyle were collected during the base-
line evaluation and included age, sex, race
(African American, Caucasian, or other),
poverty index (total household income in
the numerator and total income necessary
to maintain the family on a nutritionally
adequate food plan in the denominator;
values 1 indicate incomes above pov-
erty), education level (completed 8th
grade, 9th­12th grade, or some college or
college graduate), BMI (weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters
squared), subscapular and triceps skin-
fold, physical activity as described previ-
ously (15), total cholesterol, systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
and hypertension (systolic blood pressure
140 or diastolic blood pressure 90 or
self-reported medication for high blood
pressure). Detailed cigarette smoking his-
tory information was collected for 3,420
participants at baseline and for the re-
maining 5,876 participants during the
1982­1984 follow-up. This approach has
been validated previously (15,16). A sin-
gle 24-h dietary recall was obtained.
Statistical analysis
Periodontal disease was defined in three
ways. The primary definition classified
participants into six categories using the
periodontal index as follows. Of dentate
participants, 47% (n  3,372) had peri-
odontal index  0 and were classified as
"periodontally healthy," and the remain-
ing dentate participants were further clas-
sified into quintiles (n  760/quintile)
of continuous periodontal index values.
Edentulous participants (n  2,127) were
retained in a seventh category.
In the second definition, participants
were classified as either 1) being peri-
odontally healthy (n  3,372), 2) having
gingivitis (n  2,135), or 3) having peri-
odontitis (n  1,662) as described previ-
ously (4,15).
In a third approach, tooth loss was
considered as a surrogate definition of
periodontal disease as it is often a conse-
quence of periodontal disease (17). Par-
ticipants were categorized as follows: 1)
24­32 teeth (reference group), 2) 18­23
teeth, 3) 8­17 teeth, or 4) 1­7 teeth.
Logistic regression analysis was used
to assess the association between baseline
periodontal disease and the cumulative
incidence of diabetes. The SURVEYLO-
GISTIC procedure in SAS (version 9.1;
SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to ap-
propriately account for the stratification,
clustering, and sample weights of
NHANES I. Incidence density of diabetes
was not considered because of uncer-
tainty in diabetes onset timing, as dis-
cussed previously (18). Multiple models
with various degrees of covariate adjust-
ment are presented to provide clarity re-
garding confounding by design variables
(age, sex, and race), socioeconomic status
(education and poverty index), health be-
haviors (smoking status, physical activity,
and diet), general vascular health status
(hypertension and total cholesterol),
and/or obesity (BMI and skinfold). For
the present analysis, smoking was defined
in four categories: 1) current, 2) former, 3)
never, or 4) reported history of smoking,
current status unknown. The creation of
the fourth smoking category avoids the
elimination of those participants from the

analysis and prevents biasing parameter
estimates for current (underestimation of
smoking risk) or former (overestimation
of smoking risk) smokers. Removing ev-
er-smokers with unknown current status
did not change the results.
A control analysis was performed to
assess the association between caries
(DMF) and cumulative incidence of dia-
betes. We hypothesized a priori that peri-
odontal index but not DMF would be
positively associated with incident diabe-
tes. If these dual hypotheses were con-
firmed, it would add specificity of the
findings to periodontal disease as op-
posed to general oral health.
RESULTS -- The mean  SD age of
participants was 50  19 years, and at
entry 60% were women, 84% were white,
15% were black, and 1% were other.
Those with periodontal disease tended to
be older, male, nonwhite, smokers, and of
lower socioeconomic status as reported
previously (15) (Table A1 of the online
appendix available at http://dx.doi.org/
10.2337/dc08-0026). There was a wide
range of mean periodontal index values
among participants defined as having ei-
ther gingivitis (periodontal index range 
0.06­8.00) or periodontitis (periodontal
index range  0.88­8.00). Therefore,
the primary exposure definition catego-
rizing participants into six categories
based on periodontal index values is more
nuanced.
During a follow-up period of 17  4
years (range 1­22 years), 817 incident di-
abetes cases were reported (cumulative
incidence  9%). Of the incident cases,
77% were identified or confirmed via ei-
ther death certificate or health care facility
discharge diagnosis codes; only 4% of
cases (n  30) were from death certificate
only. A physician diagnosis was self-
reported by 55% (Table A2 of the online
appendix).
Among nonperiodontal characteris-
tics, age, sex, education, BMI, subscapu-
lar skinfold, and hypertension were
strong predictors of incident diabetes. An
approximate 2-SD increase in either BMI
or subscapular skinfold was associated
with a twofold increase in the odds of in-
cident diabetes (P  0.0001 for both
comparisons). Odds were increased by
30% for a 10-year age increase (P 
0.0001), 50% for men (P  0.001), and
40% for being hypertensive (P  0.01).
Current and former smokers experienced

0.08) and 26% (P  0.14) increased odds
of type 2 diabetes, respectively.
In multivariable models, incident di-
abetes odds varied across periodontal in-
dex categories (Table 1). Relative to
participants with periodontal index
(PI)  0.0 (PI0), participants in the PI1 or
PI2 categories did not experience an in-
creased odds of developing diabetes,
whereas the odds increased sharply in the
PI3 category (OR 2.08; P  0.0001). The
ORs in PI4 (1.71; P  0.003) and PI5
(1.50; P  0.06) categories abated but
remained elevated and were not statisti-
cally significantly different from the odds
for those in the PI3 category. Edentulous
participants experienced a 30% increase
in diabetes odds relative to those in the
PI0 category (P  0.05), but a 37% de-
crease in odds relative to those in the PI3
category (P  0.01). The findings were
unchanged when the analysis was re-
stricted to incident diabetes cases occur-
ring 10 years after baseline (Table 2).
Participants in the PI3 category again
demonstrated the highest OR of 2.26 (P 
0.0001). Supplemental analyses adjust-
ing further for pack-years of smoking did
not change the results (data not shown).
A twofold increase in diabetes odds
was observed among participants in the
PI3 category even among subgroups of
never smokers or participants with BMI
25 kg/m2 (Table 3). Women in the PI3
category had an OR of 2.84 (95% CI
1.87­4.32) compared with 1.50 (95% CI
0.89­2.55) among men (Pinteraction

0.12). The highest diabetes OR of 1.65
(95% CI 1.01­2.70) was observed for
men in the PI4 category (Table 3). No di-
abetes risk gradient across periodontal
disease categories was apparent in blacks
(Pinteraction
 0.07).
Using the second periodontal disease
definition, after multivariable adjust-
ment, incident diabetes odds were in-
creased by 40% among participants with
gingivitis (P  0.05) and by 50% among
participants with periodontitis (P  0.05)
compared with periodontally healthy
participants.
Participants missing 25­31 teeth at
baseline had an incident diabetes OR of
1.70 relative to participants missing 0­8
teeth (P  0.05). Intermediate tooth loss
was not associated with incident diabetes.
Finally, in the control analysis, there
was no association between the DMF in-
dex and incident diabetes. The pattern of
ORs across increasing sextiles of DMF was
flat, with ORs ranging from 0.82 (95% CI
0.51­1.34) in the second sextile to 0.92
(0.57­1.49) in the sixth sextile.
CONCLUSIONS -- We report a pos-
itive nonlinear association between base-
line periodontal disease and incident type
2 diabetes in the NHANES I and NHEFS.
This association persisted regardless of
the periodontal disease definition. When
compared with healthy participants, par-
ticipants with intermediate levels of peri-
odontal disease had a twofold increased
odds of incident diabetes, and the odds
remained elevated among participants
with the highest levels of periodontal dis-
ease. Advanced tooth loss was associated
with an approximate 70% increased odds
of incident diabetes. Relative to periodon-
tally healthy participants, edentulous par-
ticipants experienced an intermediate
30% increased odds of diabetes.
Findings remained after extensive mul-
tivariable adjustment for potential con-
founders, including both BMI and
subscapular skinfold, and in a subgroup
analysis restricted to participants with BMI
25 kg/m2. The association remained
strong after adjustment for smoking status
or pack-years of smoking, as well as among
never smokers. Dietary factors such as fat,
protein, or carbohydrate intake, as well as
total caloric intake, did not attenuate the
findings, although we caution that dietary
data based on a single 24-h recall leave
considerable room for residual con-
founding. Finally, the observation that
the DMF index (an index related to oral
hygiene practices) was unrelated to in-
cident diabetes adds specificity to the
periodontal disease hypothesis.
Type 2 diabetes odds were substan-
tially elevated at intermediate periodontal
index levels. This might be a consequence
of periodontal disease underestimation,
in which examiners assigned the lesser of
two periodontal index values when peri-
odontal findings were equivocal. Alterna-
tively, lower thresholds of periodontal
disease, as opposed to definitions requir-
ing evidence of clinical periodontitis,
might be necessary to fully capture sub-
clinical infectious exposures relevant for
systemic disease risk (19,20). After an
abrupt type 2 diabetes risk increase in the
PI3 category, the risk leveled off in peri-
odontal index categories 3­5, indicating a
possible threshold effect, although survi-
vor bias should also be considered be-
cause participants with an advanced
periodontal index were older at baseline
and more likely to die before new-onset
diabetes could be diagnosed and reported

to the study. Alternatively, a relatively in-
creased prevalence of undiagnosed inci-
dent diabetes among individuals in the
highest periodontal index categories
could also explain the leveling of odds in
these groups.
The observed intermediate type 2 di-
abetes risk for edentulous participants is
consistent with the broader body of liter-
ature concerning periodontal disease and
systemic disease. Associations between
tooth loss and systemic disease from both
the NHEFS and other populations tend to
be positive (6), and intermediate risk is
often reported among edentulous partic-
ipants. Tooth loss might play an epidemi-
ologically confusing role in evaluation of
systemic disease hypotheses (6,21).
Tooth loss often acts concurrently as both
a consequence of chronic periodontal dis-
ease and a preventive measure for future
infectious exposure, therefore represent-
ing a mixture of risk and protection. Data
from the Oral Infections and Vascular
Disease Epidemiology Study (INVEST)
show the highest prevalence of carotid ar-
tery plaque among participants with in-
termediate tooth loss, whereas carotid
plaque prevalence remained elevated yet
attenuated among edentulous partici-
pants (21). In contrast, participants in the
Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) be-
came edentulous later in life than INVEST
participants (22), and the greatest extent
of carotid atherosclerosis in SHIP was also
observed among edentulous participants
(23). Taken together, these findings sug-
gest that edentulism occurring earlier in
life might confer some protection against
atherosclerotic development by minimiz-
ing lifetime oral infectious exposure.
If confirmed, the present results
might have implications for ongoing re-
search regarding periodontal disease and
cardiovascular disease. Specifically, type
2 diabetes might also be considered as a
mediator, in addition to a confounder, of
these associations.
The observed 50­100% increased in-
cident type 2 diabetes odds associated
with periodontal disease is clinically rele-
vant as it is comparable to the risk associ-
ated with other type 2 diabetes risk
factors. For example, in agreement with
previous research (18) we report that a
2-SD increase in either BMI or subscapu-
lar skinfold is associated with an approx-
imate 100% increase in incident diabetes
odds,whereasbeinghypertensiveorhaving
10 additional years of age increased dia-
betes odds by 40 and 30%, respectively.

study did not reach statistical significance
(P  0.12), the observation that peri-
odontal disease was apparently more
strongly associated with incident type 2
diabetes among women may be worthy of
note, given recent findings that inflamma-
tion was a stronger predictor of type 2
diabetes in women than in men (23).
Whether the current sex differences in
periodontal disease­related diabetes risk
have biological underpinnings or are
merely contextual or an artifact merits
further study.
NHANES I is limited by the lack of
fasting glucose measures to exclude undi-
agnosed baseline diabetes. Because of the
high prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes
in the general population (24), the poten-
tial for reverse causality (undiagnosed di-
abetes at baseline causes periodontitis,
but the diabetes is later discovered and
thought to be incident) exists. This possi-
bility was minimized by 1) removing in-
cident diabetes cases occurring within 1
year of baseline from all analyses and 2)
conducting a subgroup analysis restricted
to incident diabetes occurring 10 years
after baseline, because most individuals
with diabetes would probably become
symptomatic within 10 years. Similarly,
the potential for diagnostic bias during
follow-up to explain these findings is un-
likely. For this bias to remove our finding,
the rate of undiagnosed diabetes would
have to be substantially higher among pe-
riodontally healthy (our reference group)
individuals relative to those with ad-
vanced periodontal disease, thus artifi-
cially reducing diabetes incidence among
individuals without periodontal disease.
Although not impossible, this possibility
seems unlikely because the probability of
undiagnosed diabetes in NHANES III has
been reported to be higher among indi-
viduals with as opposed to those without
periodontitis (25). Further, according to
previously published NHANES data, the
probability of undiagnosed diabetes is
highest among groups with elevated type
2 diabetes risk factors (24). In the present
report, participants with advanced peri-
odontal disease also had elevated type 2
diabetes risk factors. Therefore, it is more
likely that participants with periodontal
disease experienced a higher rate of undi-
agnosed diabetes during follow-up than
periodontally healthy participants. If so,
this occurrence would bias results toward
the null. An adverse family history or
common genetic susceptibility underly-
ing both periodontal disease and type 2
diabetes also remains as a possible expla-
nation for our findings. We were unable
to account for this potential as neither ge-
netic data nor information regarding a
family history of periodontal disease and
diabetes were collected in NHANES I.
Studies with more precise measures
of infectious exposure can increase our
understanding of the association between
bacteria-induced periodontal disease and
diabetes, as was recently done for cardio-
vascular disease outcomes (26). Never-
theless, the observations that both clinical
periodontal disease and tooth loss, but
not the DMF index, were associated with
incident type 2 diabetes bolster the
chronic periodontal infection hypothesis.
We have found baseline periodontal
disease to be a clinically relevant and
novel predictor of incident type 2 diabetes
in a large, population-based sample rep-
resentative of U.S. adults. The prediction
of type 2 diabetes from periodontal dis-
ease was not explained by confounding
related to known diabetes risk factors and
could reflect a shared biological pathway,
such as chronic low-grade inflammation.
Nevertheless, these findings require con-
firmation in populations with fasting glu-
cose or A1C measurements to definitively
rule out diagnostic bias. If confirmed, a
contributory role of periodontal disease
in the development of type 2 diabetes is
potentially of public health importance
because of the prevalence of treatable
periodontal diseases in the population
(27) and the pervasiveness of diabetes-
associated morbidity and mortality.
