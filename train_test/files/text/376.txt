Abstract
Concurrent with increasing prostate cancer incidence
and declining prostate cancer mortality in the United
States, the prevalence of obesity has been increasing
steadily. Several studies have reported that obesity is
associated with increased risk of high-grade prostate
cancer and prostate cancer mortality, and it is thus
likely that the increase in obesity has increased the
burden of prostate cancer. In this study, we assess
the potential effect of increasing obesity on prostate
cancer incidence and mortality. We first estimate
obesity-associated relative risks of low- and high-grade
prostate cancer using data from the Prostate Cancer
Prevention Trial. Then, using obesity prevalence data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey and prostate cancer incidence data from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program,
we convert annual grade-specific prostate cancer
incidence rates into incidence rates conditional on
weight category. Next, we combine the conditional inci-
dence rates with the 1980 prevalence rates for each
weight category to project annual grade-specific inci-
dence under 1980 obesity levels. We use a simulation
model based on observed survival and mortality data to
translate the effects of obesity trends on prostate cancer
incidence into effects on disease-specific mortality.
The predicted increase in obesity prevalence since 1980
increased high-grade prostate cancer incidence by
15.5% and prostate cancer mortality by between 7.0%
(under identical survival for obese and nonobese cases)
and 23.0% (under different survival for obese and
nonobese cases) in 2002. We conclude that increasing
obesity prevalence since 1980 has partially obscured
declines in prostate cancer mortality. (Cancer Epide-
miol Biomarkers Prev 2009;18(3):808­15)
Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in
American men, with f219,000 new cases diagnosed in
2007 (1). From 1992 to 2004, prostate cancer death rates
in the United States dropped by a staggering 35% (2),
most likely due to a combination of increased prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) screening and advances in pro-
state cancer treatment practices (3, 4). For example,
data from Austria, the United States, and the United
Kingdom show that populations with high PSA screen-
ing rates have lower prostate cancer mortality rates than
populations with low uptake of screening (5, 6). In
addition to trends in treatment and screening practices,
it is important to consider trends in population-level
risk exposures such as obesity.
Between 1980 and 2002, obesity [defined as body mass
index (BMI) z30 kg/m2] prevalence rates in men ages 40
to 74 years more than doubled in the United States, from
15% to 32% (7). In contrast, overweight (25 V BMI < 30)
prevalence rates remained relatively constant at around
44% over this time period (see Fig. 1; ref. 7). Obesity has
been associated with a greater incidence of high-grade
prostate cancer (8-11), with poorer disease-specific
survival (12) and clinical outcomes after cancer treatment
(13), and with worse other-cause survival (14).
The association between obesity and high-grade
prostate cancer is biologically plausible because obesity
is associated with marked alterations in the serum con-
centrations of numerous hormones such as estrogen, tes-
tosterone, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, all of
which have been linked to prostate cancer, and leptin,
which has been associated with high-grade prostate
cancer (15-18). Obesity is also associated with increased
levels of several biomarkers related to inflammation,
including interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-a (19).
A number of publications have shown that chronic
inflammation is associated with proliferative inflamma-
tory lesions that may be precursors of prostate tumors
(21-23).
The association between obesity and low-grade pros-
tate cancer is less clear. Although some studies have
also linked obesity with a modestly reduced incidence of
low-grade disease (11, 23), others have found no asso-
ciation (8, 24, 25). Several studies have found that obese
men have very slightly decreased PSA levels (26-28)
and enlarged prostates (29, 30). Thus, obese men with

prostate cancer may be less likely to be referred to
biopsy, and obese men receiving biopsies may be more
likely to receive false-negative results (31). However,
there is much uncertainty about whether these potential
diagnostic biases could substantially affect rates of low-
grade disease.
Given that obesity is associated with worse high-grade
incidence and survival, and given that its protective
effects for low-grade cancer are likely modest, the fact
that mortality has declined despite increasing obesity
suggests that even greater gains could have been seen
had obesity rates remained constant over time. In this
study, we investigate the extent to which the increasing
prevalence of obesity has increased prostate cancer
incidence and mortality in the United States. Our
investigation uses data on grade-specific disease inci-
dence, the annual prevalence of obesity in the United
States, and information from the Prostate Cancer
Prevention Trial (PCPT) on the link between obesity
and grade-specific incidence. With this information, we
estimate the grade-specific prostate cancer incidence that
would have been observed had the prevalence of obesity
remained constant between 1980 and 2002 and compare
projected and observed trends. We then use survival data
to translate the difference between the grade-specific
incidence curves under projected and observed trends
into the effect of the observed increase in obesity on age-
adjusted mortality.
Materials and Methods
Our method to project grade-specific prostate cancer
incidence had overweight and obese prevalence rates
remained constant between 1980 and 2002 consists of two
components: (a) calculating grade-specific incidence
rates from 1980 to 2002 conditional on weight category
(healthy, overweight, and obese) and (b) the conditional
grade-specific incidence rates on weight category toge-
ther with 1980 prevalence rates of each weight category
to project overall, or unconditional, grade-specific inci-
dence rates under 1980 obesity levels. Both components
rely on weight trend data, patterns of prostate cancer
incidence, and relative risks of low- and high-grade
cancer associated with being overweight and obese.
Trends in Overweight and Obese Prevalence Rates
in the United States. Overweight and obese prevalence
rates among American males ages 40 to 74 y between
1980 and 2002 were obtained from National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) public use data
files.4 NHANES has collected data on the health and
nutritional status of adults and children in the United
States since the 1960s. The NHANES survey questions
are administered to a nationally representative sample of
individuals, and the survey results are extrapolated to
produce estimates for the general population. NHANES
did not collect data on men ages 75 y or older until 1988;
therefore, our analysis is limited to men ages 40 to
74 y. NHANES defines healthy weight as a BMI < 25,
overweight as a 25 V BMI < 30, and obese as BMI z 30.
NHANES publishes age-specific data on population
overweight and obese prevalence rates for 1976 to 1980,
1988 to 1994, and 1999 to 2002. We assumed that the
NHANES results pertain to the midpoints of the survey
years and used linear interpolation to impute prevalence
rates for interim years.
Prostate Cancer Incidence Trends. Prostate cancer
incidence rates between 1980 and 2002 were obtained
from the core 9 population-based cancer registries
contributing data to the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer
Institute in this time period (32). We did not include
available data from later years due to changes in SEER
coding practices for prostate cancer grade beginning in
2003. Annual grade-specific incidence for men ages 40
to 74 y was calculated as cases per 100,000 men using
SEER*Stat software.5 Incidence rates were age-adjusted
to the 2000 US standard population using seven 5-y age
groups (ages 40-44 y, . . ., 70-74 y). SEER grade categories
well-differentiated and moderately differentiated were
grouped into a single category for low-grade cancer
and poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated were
grouped into a single category for high-grade cancer.
Cases with unknown grade were distributed into low-
and high-grade categories in proportion to the relative
number of known low- and high-grade cases in each year
and age group.
Relative Risks of Low- and High-Grade Prostate
Cancer for Overweight and Obese Men. Table 1
summarizes studies of the risk of high-grade prostate
cancer associated with overweight and obese weight
categories: there are five cohort studies (10, 11, 24, 25, 33),
one case-control study (8), and one cohort study nested
within a randomized controlled trial (23). These studies
used a variety of definitions of high-grade prostate
cancer and obesity, yet most reported at least some
increased risk for high-grade prostate cancer associated

with the highest category of BMI. To obtain risk esti-
mates appropriate for weight categories consistent with
NHANES definitions and grade categories consistent
with SEER, we reanalyzed data from the PCPT.
The PCPT was a randomized controlled trial con-
ducted to investigate the efficacy of finasteride as a
chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. The trial
enrolled 18,880 healthy men to receive either placebo or
finasteride and provided annual prostate cancer screen-
ing for up to 7 y of follow up. Our analysis considers the
911 participants diagnosed with prostate cancer after for-
cause biopsy (i.e., biopsy triggered by suspicious PSA or
digital rectal examination results) relative to the 9,347
participants who underwent end-of-study biopsy and
therefore have known disease status. These definitions of
case and control populations circumvent a potential
problem in this data set if associations of obesity with
cases diagnosed without cause (i.e., detections among
end-of-study biopsies) differed from those diagnosed
under standard clinical practice. A prior analysis of these
data (23) showed that men with a BMI z 30 had a 78%
increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason
score 8-10) compared with men with BMI <25. In
contrast, BMI z 30 was associated with an 18% decreased
risk of low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score 2-7)
compared with BMI < 25.
To use risk estimates appropriate for NHANES weight
categories, we reanalyzed the PCPT data considered in
Gong et al. (23). First, we constructed NHANES weight
categories w = 1, 2, 3 for healthy weight (BMI < 25),
overweight (25 V BMI < 30), and obese (BMI z 30). We
then estimated grade-specific relative risks for categories
2 and 3 relative to 1 via Poisson regression modeling of
individual-level observations, adjusting for age, race,
family history of prostate cancer, diabetes status, and
finasteride arm. The Poisson regressions yielded relative
risks rgw
for overweight low-grade (rL2
), overweight
high-grade (rH2
), obese low-grade (rL3
), and obese high-
grade (rH3
) prostate cancer incidence relative to healthy
weight men.
Grade-Specific Incidence Trends Conditional on
Weight Categories. We used the estimated relative risks
to obtain annual grade-specific prostate cancer incidence
conditional on weight category. By the law of total
probability, the unconditional incidence rate for grade g
and year y given age group a can be written as follows:
Ig
ðyjaÞ ¼ X
w
Ig
ðyja; wÞPy
ðwjaÞ; ðAÞ
where Ig
(y|a, w) denotes the incidence rate for grade g,
year y, age group a, and weight category w, and Py
(w|a)
represents the prevalence of weight category w in year y
given age group a (with, fw
Py
(w|a) = 1). Using the
relative risks rgw
for g = L; H and w = 2, 3 estimated
from the PCPT data we have:
Ig
ðyja; wÞ ¼ rgw
Ig
ðyja; 1Þ
We can now replace the terms for overweight and
obese incidence in (1) with healthy weight incidence
scaled by the risk of disease for individuals in these
weight categories relative to healthy weight individuals.
Consequently, for each grade g, year y, and age group a,
we have one equation in one unknown and can solve
equation (A) for healthy weight incidence. With this
solution, we immediately obtain incidence for overweight
and obese individuals using the estimated relative risks.
Projecting Grade-Specific Incidence Trends under
1980 Obesity Levels. To project grade-specific incidence
assuming that overweight and obese prevalence rates
had remained constant at 1980 levels, we use the
conditional grade-specific incidence rates computed
above together with prevalence rates observed in 1980
as follows to approximate the expected incidence by
grade, year, and age group:
Ie
g
ðyjaÞ ¼ X
w
Ig
ðyja; wÞP1980
ðwjaÞ:
Here, the notation f designates unconditional grade-
specific incidence under constant 1980 overweight and
obese prevalence rates. Comparing Ig
(y|a) with I
f
g
(y|a)
allows us to estimate the effect of the observed increase
in obesity in the United States on prostate cancer
incidence. To quantify the uncertainty in our estimates
due to uncertainty in the estimated relative risks, we also
estimate the effect of increasing obesity on high-grade
prostate cancer incidence using end points of the 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for the relative risks.
As a by-product of this calculation, we can estimate
obesity distributions among prostate cancer cases by
grade, year, and age group using Bayes theorem:
Py
ðwja; gÞ ¼
Ig
ðyja; wÞ Py
ðwjaÞ
P
w
Ig
ðyja; wÞ Py
ðwjaÞ
;
where Py
(w|a, g) is the proportion of cases diagnosed in
year, age group, and grade who decrease into weight
category w. This ability to classify the low- and high-
grade cases by obesity status at diagnosis is useful when
we translate the effect of obesity on incidence into its
effect on mortality.
Effect on Mortality. To translate the effect on
incidence into the effect on mortality, we use a micro-
simulation model of prostate cancer and other-cause
death given grade-specific incidence patterns. The model
first generates populations to match case counts by age
group, year, and grade corresponding to observed and
projected incidence rates Ig
(y|a) and I
f
g
(y|a). Each case is
assigned a disease-specific and other-cause survival time
from the date of diagnosis. Both survival times are
allowed to depend on obesity status at diagnosis, which
is assigned based on obesity distributions obtained as
described above.
We consider two prostate cancer survival hazard ratios
for obese men: hpc = 1 (no effect of obesity on disease-
specific survival) and hpc = 2:6 (obesity adversely
affects disease-specific survival). These hazard ratios
represent the instantaneous risk of death in obese versus
nonobese prostate cancer cases. The latter hazard ratio
was estimated by Gong et al. (34) for men ages 40 to
64 y, but we assume for ages 65 to 74 y as well. This
estimate is remarkably similar to that reported by Ma
et al. (35), who found a hazard ratio of 2.66 for obese
versus nonobese prostate cancer cases in the Physicians
Health Study. Analogous to our method for obtaining

incidence rates by weight category using relative risks, we
partition SEER cause-specific survival curves by age and
year of diagnosis into weight category­specific sur-
vival curves by noting that each corresponding hazard
function is a weighted combination of the hazard
functions for obese and nonobese with the weights given
by the obesity distributions. For any hazard ratio of
prostate cancer death, we can therefore solve for the
survival among nonobese cases and use the hazard ratio
to obtain survival among obese cases. The obese and
nonobese cause­specific survival curves are derived
under observed obesity trends in the population. The
simulation model uses these curves to produce mortality
projections corresponding to grade-specific incidence
under both observed weight trends and under constant
1980 prevalence rates.
Similarly, we consider two other-cause survival
hazard ratios for obese men: hoc = 1 (no effect of obesity
on disease-specific survival) and (h1
oc h2
oc h3
oc) = (1.4, 1.2,
1.1) for age groups 40 to 54 y, 55 to 64 y, and
65 to 74 y (obesity adversely affects disease-specific
survival). The latter set was estimated by Davis et al.
(36). We assume that all-cause mortality hazard ratios
are adequate approximations of other-cause mortality
hazard ratios.
Each case in the model is assigned a date of death
given by the minimum of the dates of cause-specific and
other-cause death; cause of death is assigned according-
ly. The model tabulates prostate cancer deaths by grade
at diagnosis and age and year at death. The difference
between the prostate cancer deaths under observed and
constant 1980 weight trends each year is age-adjusted
and subtracted from observed mortality to project
mortality trends had BMI prevalence rates remained at
1980 levels. Differences between the observed and pro-
jected mortality counts are inflated to the US population
to estimate the number of excess deaths nationally due
to observed increases in BMI in the population. To limit
random variation due to the simulation model, results
of 50 independent runs are averaged to produce the
final results.
To validate our model projections, we compare
incidence-based mortality since 1980 (i.e., prostate
cancer deaths among cases diagnosed after 1980 as a
percentage of the population) observed in SEER and
corresponding incidence-based mortality projected un-
der observed obesity trends. This provides an opportu-
nity to check that the overall number of deaths produced
by the model reasonably approximates that observed in
practice.

did not differ significantly between cases and controls.
Table 2 also reports the estimated relative risks for
overweight and obese men relative to healthy weight
men by grade for all participants and for the placebo arm
only. Considering data from all participants, we found
that obesity (BMI z 30) was associated with a nonsig-
nificant decreased risk of low-grade prostate cancer. In
contrast, obesity was associated with a significant 79%
increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Consistent
with Gong et al. (23), we found that the higher risk
of low- and high-grade prostate cancer for obese men
was similar across study arms. They defined low-grade

and found a significant reduction in the risk of these
tumors among obese men. We combined Gleason 7 with
lower grade tumors for consistency with SEER data and
to sidestep changes in grading practices over time that
have resulted in a considerable shift from lower to higher
grades within this group (37).
Figure 2 plots the observed incidence of low- and high-
grade disease together with the projected incidence given
1980 overweight and obese prevalence rates using
relative risks from our reanalysis of PCPT data with
95% confidence limits. Results indicate that age-adjusted
low-grade incidence would have been 280.8 (95% CI,
271.1-291.5) instead of the observed 277.1 cases per
100,000 men, high-grade incidence would have been 50.1
(95% CI, 45.9-55.7) instead of the observed 57.8 cases
per 100,000 men, and all-grade incidence would have
been 330.8 (95% CI, 317.1-347.2) instead of the observed
334.9 cases per 100,000 men in 2002. In other words, the
increase in obesity is estimated to have produced a 1.3%
decrease in age-adjusted low-grade incidence (95% CI,
4.9% decrease to 2.2% increase), a 15.5% increase in age-
adjusted high-grade incidence (95% CI, 3.9% increase to
25.9% increase), and a 0.7% increase in age-adjusted all-
grade incidence (95% CI, 3.2% decrease to 4.4% increase)
in 2002. See Table 3.
Under equal risks of prostate cancer and other-cause
death for obese men, model projections under observed
obesity trends validate well, with small (<5%) mean
relative errors across years for all age groups. The model
projects increasing additional deaths attributable to
increasing obesity in all age groups, with 70% of these
deaths among men ages 65 to 74 years. Totaling across
years from 1980 to 2002, we estimate that increasing
obesity could account for 5,687 of the observed 245,158
prostate cancer deaths in the United States during this
interval. After age adjusting and converting to rates, we
estimate that in 2002 the observed prostate cancer death
rate was 7.0% higher than would have been expected
had obesity prevalence remained constant at 1980 levels
(95% CI, 0.4% lower to 11.5% higher).
Under higher risks of prostate cancer and other-cause
death for obese men, model projections under observed
obesity trends again validate well, with small (<8%)
mean relative errors across years for all age groups. The
model projects increasing additional deaths attributable
to increasing obesity in all age groups, again with 70% of
these deaths among men ages 65 to 74 years. Summing
over 1980 to 2002, we estimate that increasing obesity
may be responsible for 19,370 of the observed 245,158
prostate cancer deaths in the United States in this
interval. Age adjusting and converting to rates, we
estimate that in 2002 the observed prostate cancer death
rate was 23.0% higher than would have been expected
had obesity prevalence remained constant at 1980 levels
(95% CI, 15.8% higher to 29.3% higher). Figure 3

and other-cause death for obese men.
Discussion
The consequences of the obesity epidemic in the United
States are far-reaching and, in the case of diseases such as
cardiac disease and diabetes, well studied. In recent
years, evidence linking obesity with adverse outcomes in
prostate cancer has accumulated, but the likely popula-
tion effects have not been quantified. We used NHANES
data on overweight and obesity prevalence rates in
conjunction with disease incidence, survival, and mor-
tality data from SEER to quantify how prostate cancer
trends have been affected by the increase in obesity in
this country. We estimated that increasing BMI levels
since 1980 may have decreased low-grade incidence by
1.3% and increased high-grade incidence by 15.5%. In
addition, we estimated that these trends may have
increased prostate cancer deaths by between 7.0% (under
obesity-independent disease-specific and other-cause
survival rates) and 23.0% (under different survival for
obese and nonobese cases) in 2002. Our findings suggest
that despite the dramatic declines in prostate cancer
mortality observed since 1992, deaths from the disease
might have declined even further had obesity prevalence
rates not simultaneously increased.
This study has several limitations. Although NHANES
is an excellent source of population-based obesity data,
the NHANES survey was conducted intermittently
between 1980 and 2002, and data were pooled over
several years. We interpolated overweight and obesity
levels for years with no survey data, assuming that
overweight and obesity levels followed linear trends in
the interim. In addition, our computations of grade-
specific incidence given weight category in a given year
and our estimates of the obesity-associated relative risks
of low- and high-grade disease are based on current
obesity status and do not take into account obesity
history or duration. Although it is likely that the risk of
prostate cancer at any given age depends on risk factors
accumulated over several years, neither the NHANES
data on obesity prevalence nor the PCPT data on risk of
disease associated with obesity provide information on
individual obesity histories. Our mortality simulation
model allows obese and nonobese men to have different
risks of prostate cancer death, but the magnitude of the
increase in risk due to obesity is still uncertain. Some
studies do not find a significant increase in risk, and
although a number of studies have found a positive
association, only two (34, 35) provide estimates of the
relative risk. Because the effect on mortality is highly
dependent on how obesity affects the risk of prostate
cancer death over and above its effect on high-grade
incidence, it will be important to refine the estimate of
the obesity-associated risk of prostate cancer death
provided as input to the model as more information
becomes available. Thus, the uncertainty inherent in our
mortality estimates is greater than what is reflected in
CIs and may be reduced as more specific model inputs
become available.
In conclusion, current evidence indicates that trends in
obesity have likely increased the incidence of high-grade
prostate cancer over time, with a nontrivial effect on
prostate cancer mortality through 2002. We conclude
that in the absence of increasing prevalence of obesity,
the decline in prostate cancer mortality in the United
States would have been noticeably more pronounced
than was observed. This analysis underscores the com-
plexity of the determinants of prostate cancer inci-
dence and mortality trends and shows that it is likely
that these trends depend on factors beyond screening
and treatment.
