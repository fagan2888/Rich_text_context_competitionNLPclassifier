Abstract
Objective: To assess a classification system for midfoot injury that was based on the
characteristics of the foot malunion and to evaluate the suggested treatment strategies.
Methods: This retrospective review of data from patients with posttraumatic midfoot malunion
categorized each foot deformity into one of three types based on the foot arch and then separated
these categories into one of three subtypes based on the forefoot deformity. According to the
types of malunion, fascio-cutaneous flap, osteotomy, joint arthrodesis or realignment was used to
correct the deformity. Patients were assessed before surgery and at 12 and 24 months
postoperation.
Results: Of the 24 patients identified, six had Lisfranc joint injuries, nine had Lisfranc joint complex
injuries combined with cuboid compression fractures and nine had Lisfranc joint complex injuries
combined with navicular fractures. Overall, eight patients presented with poor soft tissue and
massive scar at the dorsal foot. Visual analogue scale and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle
Society midfoot scores significantly improved over the 24-month study period. At the end of the
study, 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) rated their functional outcome as excellent or good.
Conclusion: The classification of the midfoot malunion evaluated in this study may be helpful in
the decision making process for surgical intervention.

Introduction
The number of patients with a `high energy'
or violent injury is increasing especially in
western countries.1 These types of trauma
often result in lower extremity injuries, such
as midfoot fractures, which have a high

impact on functional outcome.2,3 For exam-
ple, in Greece, the annual incidence of midfoot
fracture is approximately 1/30 000 people and
it accounts for 0.4% of all fractures.4,5
The midfoot includes the metatarsal base,
five small bones (i.e. navicular, cuboid and
three cuneiform) and the Chopart joint.4 The
anatomical stability of the midfoot depends
on the structure of the ligaments, joint
capsules and muscles within the foot. For
displaced injuries, treatment options include
closed reduction with or without fixation,6­11
open reduction using various methods of
fixation (e.g. Kirschner wires,6,12­14 different
types of screws,15­18 extra-articular plate fixa-
tion,19,20 or a suture-button device21,22), and
primary arthrodesis.23,24 Improper treat-
ment of a foot injury can easily lead to foot
malunion, which is characterized by pain,
deformity, and dysfunction of the foot.25
Typically, most patients require surgery to cor-
rect the deformity and the choice of surgical
approach depends on the type of malunion.26
External fixation to treat midfoot mal-
union has been reviewed,27 and a thorough
anatomical classification scheme has been
reported based on the segmental patterns of
injury and the forces involved.9 With the
exception of these two published articles, to
our knowledge, little information is avail-
able on the treatment of midfoot malunion.
Therefore, the aim of this retrospective
review was to assess a classification system
for midfoot injury, which was based on the
characteristics of the foot malunion and
evaluate our suggested treatment strategies.
Patients and Methods
Patient population and study design
This was a retrospective review of data
obtained from patients who had been trea-
ted in the Department of Orthopaedics,
Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School
of Medicine, Shanghai, China between June
2004 and June 2012 for posttraumatic mid-
foot malunion. The inclusion criteria were a
midfoot fracture or dislocation for more
than 6 months and an X-ray showing foot
residual deformity or joint degeneration.
The exclusion criteria were: (i) neurological
and/or vascular complications; (ii) diabetes
mellitus; (iii) foot neoplasms; (iv) Charcot
arthropathy. The type of injury, treatment
and time from initial injury to reconstructive
surgery were recorded by one of the inves-
tigators (C.G.L.). Each foot deformity (mal-
union) was categorized retrospectively by
C.G.L. into one of three types based on the
foot arch: Type I, the foot arch was normal;
Type II, pes cavus deformity; Type III,
flatfoot deformity (Figure 1). Subsequently,
based on the forefoot deformity, each type
was categorized into one of three subtypes:
Type a, forefoot abduction; Type b, forefoot
adduction; Type c, normal forefoot.
Prior to the operation, patients had (i)
assessed their level of pain using a visual
analogue scale (VAS)28 that ranged from 0 (no
pain) to 10 (severe pain); and (ii) assessed their
function using the American Orthopaedic
Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) midfoot
scoring scale (0 [poor]­100 [excellent]).29
Preoperative weight bearing and non-
weight bearing X-ray and computed tomog-
raphy (CT) scans were measured and the
Coleman block test30 or antiColeman block
test31 performed to determine if the calcaneus
had a structural or functional varus deformity.
This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Tongji Hospital and complied
with the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients provided written informed consent.
Surgical techniques
Continuous spinal or epidural anaesthesia had
been induced with the patient in a supine or
lateral position. According to the types of
malunion, a fascio-cutaneous flap, osteotomy,
joint arthrodesis or realignment had been
chosen to correct the deformity. A pneumatic
tourniquet was used during surgery and one or
more longitudinal incisions were made as
906 Journal of International Medical Research 44(4)
required. A single dorsal incision in the inter-
space between the first and second metatarsal
was made for the fusion of the first and second
tarso-metatarsal joints.
For simple Lisfranc joint fractures and
dislocations (i.e. the first to fifth tarso-
metatarsal joint fracture or dislocation)
the affected joint was reduced and the first

based on the foot arch and then these were further categorized into one of three subtypes based on the forefoot
deformity. The types were: Type I, the foot arch was normal; Type II, pes cavus deformity; Type III, flatfoot
deformity. The subtypes were: Type a, forefoot abduction; Type b, forefoot adduction; Type c, normal forefoot.

tarso-metatarsal joint was fused. The second
and third tarso-metatarsal joints were fused
or fixed according to the dislocation and
articular cartilage damage, and in cases
where the fourth and fifth tarso-metatarsal
joints were dislocated, open reduction was
performed under direct vision and fixation
was performed with a 2 mm Kirschner wire.
In cases where there was significant degen-
eration of the lateral column and persistent
pain, fusion of the fourth or fifth tarso-
metatarsal joint was required.
For severe Lisfranc joint complex injuries,
in patients with mild abduction deformity,
and when the therapeutic effects of talo-first
metatarsal angle reduction were not satisfac-
tory, the affected joints were fused after
medial osteotomy. In patients with severe
abduction deformity, medial and lateral inci-
sions were made followed by medial wedge
osteotomy and lateral column lengthening.
The bone from the medial osteotomy could
have been used to prolong the lateral column
and, if required, autologous iliac bone could
have been used. The principles of midfoot
joint fusion were to ensure joint stability and
retention of the talonavicular and calcaneo-
cuboid joint function as much as possible.
If severe degeneration, preoperative impair-
ment of activities and/or persistent pain were
present, the talonavicular and calcaneocu-
boid joints could be fused simultaneously.
Other tarsal joint instability was also treated
with arthrodesis.
For patients with poor soft tissues and
massive scars at the dorsal foot, fascio-
cutaneous flap grafting was performed fol-
lowed by fracture/dislocation reduction by
simple fixtures. In the event that the foot
structure and morphology recovered poorly,
osteotomy and rigid fixation were undertaken.
Following all surgery, patients were
immobilized in a neutral position by a plaster
cast for 2 weeks. Patients were encouraged to
do partial weight bearing activities using a
postoperative brace for 6 weeks. Full weight
bearing was delayed for 10 to 14 weeks after
fracture healing was confirmed by radio-
logical examinations.
Patients had been assessed preoperation
and thereafter at 12 and 24 months.
Anteroposterior, lateral and oblique X­rays
had been taken to assess the integration of
joint morphology and healing. At 12 and
24 months, patients had been assessed using
the VAS to assess weight bearing and walk-
ing pain and the AOFAS midfoot score to
assess functional outcome. At 24 months,
patients were categorized into different
groups according to their AOFAS midfoot
scale score for functional outcome (i.e. 90­
100, excellent; 75­89, good; 50­74, fair;< 50,
poor).29 Patient satisfaction with surgery was
assessed as the patient being able to return
back to work and the treatment having no
impact on their daily activities.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Paired t-tests were used to com-
pare data and a P-value < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant
with a 2-tailed test. No allowance was
made for multiple testing.
Results
Twenty-four patients (21 men and three
women) with posttraumatic midfoot malu-
nion were treated between June 2004 and
June 2012. Their ages ranged from 16 to 65
years with a mean Æ SD age of 37.8Æ 7.5
years. The cause of injury was direct violence
in 15 cases and indirect violence in nine cases.
According to the site of injury, there were six
Lisfranc joint injuries, nine Lisfranc joint
complex injuries combined with cuboid com-
pression fractures and nine Lisfranc joint
complex injuries combined with navicular
fractures. In eight patients, large area scars
formed due to severe soft tissue injury.

With the exception of two patients who were
misdiagnosed and not initially treated, the
remaining 22 patients had been treated (i.e.
three with closed reduction and cast immo-
bilization; four with closed reduction and
percutaneous Kirschner wire fixation; seven
with open reduction and internal fixation
with Kirschner wire; eight with open reduc-
tion and rigid fixation). The meanÆ SD time
from initial injury to the reconstruction
operation was 13.5 Æ 5.4 months (range
10­25 months).
Of the 24 patients with midfoot malu-
nion, two were Type Ia, four were Type Ic,
nine were Type IIa, two were Type IIb, four
were Type IIIa and three were Type IIIc.
The mean Æ SD preoperative VAS score for
all patients was 9.0 Æ 1.0 (range 7­10) and
the mean Æ SD score for AOFAS midfoot
scoring was 42.4 Æ 7.0 (range 33­56).
The mean Æ SD time to union was 12.9 Æ
1.2 weeks (range 12.0­13.9 weeks). Patients
were followed up for a mean Æ SD of 34.7 Æ
6.3 months (range 25­53 months). VAS and
AOFAS midfoot scores improved over the
24 months. By comparison with preopera-
tive values, the improvement in both scores
was statistically significant at 12 and 24
months (P < 0.05 for all comparisons)
(Table 1). The difference between VAS and
AOFAS midfoot scores at 12 and 24 months
was also significant (P < 0.05). At 24 months,
based on AOFAS midfoot scale scores for
functional outcome, seven patients (29.2%)
rated treatment as excellent (i.e. 90­100),
14 patients (58.3%) rated treatment as good
(i.e. 75­89) and three patients (12.5%) rated
treatment as fair (i.e. 50­74). Therefore,
87.5% (21 of 24) patients rated treatment as
providing excellent or good functional
outcome.
According to radiographs taken at 24
months, the foot morphology for all patients
was much closer to anatomical status than it
had been preoperatively. At the end of the
study, the mean Æ SD talus-first metatarsal
angle was 13.2 Æ 0.4, and the mean Æ SD
calcaneus-fourth metatarsal angle was
11.5 Æ 1.5 (Table 2). These values were
significantly different compared with the
preoperative values (P < 0.05 for both com-
parisons). In 11 cases that had a cavus arch
and seven cases that had flatfoot preopera-
tively, the talus axis and metatarsal axis were
now at the same level. Three typical clinical
cases are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4.
After 12 months, five (20.8%) patients
had moderate pain (VAS ! 4), 13 (54.2%)
patients had occasional mild pain (VAS ¼ 2
or 3) and six had no pain. Most of the pain

occurred on the 2nd or 3rd tarso-metatarsal
joints. At 24 months, two (8.3%) patients
still had moderate pain, 14 (58.3%) patients
had occasional mild pain and eight had no
pain. None of the patients had a recurrent
malunion. Twenty (83.3%) patients were
satisfied with the outcome and returned to
their previous work and activities, two
(8.3%) patients had changed their occupa-
tion and worked part-time and two (8.3%)
had not resumed work.
Twenty-one patients had a stable midfoot
both subjectively and clinically. Two further
patients had superficial infection at the
dorsal foot incision. The remaining patient
presented with poor soft tissue and a mas-
sive scar on the dorsal foot and 6 weeks after
the operation, the X-ray showed malalign-
ment. Rigid fixation was removed and arth-
rodesis was conducted.
Out of the 24 patients, two patients had a
slight limp when walking. One patient pre-
sented foot pain when walking 3 years after
fusion of medial and middle column.
Discussion
The nonoperative treatment of midfoot
fractures may result in malunion, which
may in turn lead to long-term disability for
some patients.32 The goals of any midfoot
reconstruction, which is generally
accomplished with arthrodesis and realign-
ment, are to create a painless, functional,
plantigrade foot with a good appearance.
Therefore, not only is correction of the
midfoot deformity important but also any
coexisting forefoot and hindfoot deformities
need to be rectified. Indeed, a hindfoot
deformity is critical because if the heel is
left in valgus, it can cause increased prona-
tion and abduction of the midfoot and so
further deformity may develop. Moreover, if
the hindfoot is left in equinus, it can cause
pressure on the midfoot and deformity
associated with medial column instability
can reoccur.33
Due to the heterogeneity of midfoot
deformity, it is difficult to formulate a
routine protocol for treatment. However,
the main principles are to correct foot
abduction and adduction, any rotation
deformity and any arch anomaly in order
to achieve realignment. In addition, foot
stability must be maintained by restoring
foot length through bilateral osteotomy or
open osteotomy techniques. Open midfoot
injuries often cause large scars on the dorsal
foot. On occasions where there is a lack of
accurate reduction and rigid fixation at the
first surgical stage, scar contracture can
aggravate the deformity. In this present
study, there were eight patients with a
large area of foot scar formation. We are

of the opinion that it is best to remove the
dorsal scar and make a calf perforator flap
or free flap autograft. After flap survival,
reduction of the involved joints should occur
with simple fixtures to minimize irritation of
the skin and soft tissues. Although simple
fixations provide stability they may not
provide strength and so full weight bearing
should be delayed until the fracture has
healed. In the event of bone infection,
the fixation should be removed promptly.
One study recommended that dermal matrix

allograft transplantation should be used to
promote bone healing if there was nonunion
of the talonavicular joint after arthrodesis.34
However, there were no nonunion cases in
this present study.
To facilitate the classification of the mid-
foot deformity for clinicians and to assist in
the selection of an appropriate treatment,
this present study proposed a categorization
system according to the characteristics of the
foot malunion. Subsequently, according to
the types of malunion observed, the appro-
priate procedure (i.e. fascio-cutaneous flap,
osteotomy, joint arthrodesis or realignment)
was selected to correct the deformity. For
example, for patients with Type I (i.e.
normal arch), only forefoot adduction or
abduction deformity was corrected. For
Type Ia, according to the degree of abduc-
tion, the foot length determined the osteot-
omy method. If the abduction angle
was < 25, closed or open wedge osteotomy
based on foot length and soft tissue con-
tracture was considered; if the abduction
angle was ! 25, bilateral osteotomy was
required and the medial closing wedge oste-
otomy and lateral cuboid open wedge oste-
otomy were chosen. Type Ib was treated
with medial open wedge osteotomy or lat-
eral closing osteotomy according to the
severity of the deformity and soft tissue
contracture. Type Ic was mainly foot
instability or osteoarthritis and in situ
fusion was used for this. For patients with
Type II cavus arch anomalies, foot dorsal
closing wedge osteotomy was required and
attention to retain sufficient foot length was
taken. For patients with Type III flatfoot
deformities, the joint had to be stabilized
and plantar side closed osteotomy con-
ducted to correct the collapsed arch. Of the
24 patients with midfoot malunion in this
present study, two were Type Ia, four were
Type Ic, nine were Type IIa, two were Type
IIb, four were Type IIIa and three were Type
IIIc. In this present study, VAS and AOFAS
midfoot scores significantly improved over
the 24-month study period and at the end of
the study 87.5% patients rated their func-
tional outcome as excellent or good. In
addition, radiographs showed that the foot
morphology for all patients was much closer
to anatomical status than it had been
preoperatively.
The study had several limitations. First, the
sample size was small and so there were few
patients with each type of midfoot malunion.
Therefore, further studies with more patients
are required to confirm the classification
system and the therapeutic effects of the
suggested surgical therapies. Secondly, because
of the relatively long follow-up period of this
study, different types of implants were used in
the patients. Patients who were enrolled early
in this study had their joints fixed with screws,
whereas those who enrolled later had their
joints fixed with plates and screws. Future
studies should specify the type of internal
fixation for the different types of foot
deformity.
In conclusion, this study confirms that the
surgical management of midfoot malunion
provides effective and good results by stabiliz-
ing injured joints, improving alignment and
restoring the foot arch. Classification of the
midfoot malunion introduced in this study
may be helpful in the decision making process
for surgical intervention. The morphology of
the malunited midfoot can be restored by
salvaging the tarso-metatarsal joint. In add-
ition, we recommend restoring the foot arch
by reconstructive osteotomy and primarily
fusing or fixing the midfoot malunion.
