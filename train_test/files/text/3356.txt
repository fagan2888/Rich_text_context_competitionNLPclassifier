Abstract
Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of surgery and different implant
materials on subjective outcomes in patients with empty nose syndrome (ENS).
Methods: Postsurgical outcomes were assessed in a meta-analysis of patients with ENS who
underwent treatment with different implants.
Results: We identified 122 relevant studies, and 6 were included in the meta-analysis
(4 prospective trials and 2 randomized controlled trials). A significant difference was found
between the preoperative and postoperative Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT) scores for
different implants. With respect to implant materials, significant differences were observed
between autografts/allografts (AG) and foreign material grafts (FGs). A subgroup analysis of
different countries showed that more patients from China underwent surgical implant therapy than
patients from other countries.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that surgery can improve the symptoms and SNOT
scores of patients with ENS, AGs are more effective than FGs in patients with ENS, and that more
patients from China undergo surgical implant therapy than patients from other countries.

Introduction
Empty nose syndrome (ENS) is clinically
defined as an iatrogenic disorder that devel-
ops after turbinate surgery. Symptoms of
ENS include paradoxical obstruction, dry-
ness, suffocation, and dizziness. ENS, a term
first coined by Kern and Stenkvist in 1994, is
a rare yet potentially debilitating complica-
tion of inferior turbinate resection.1,2 There
are three subtypes of ENS: ENS-inferior
turbinate, ENS-middle turbinate, and ENS-
both based on the pathological changes in
the inferior, middle, and both turbinates,
respectively.3 Although ENS is not a mental
illness, it greatly influences patients' quality
of life, and psychological factors often cause
patients to experience more pain. The inabil-
ity to diagnose ENS objectively has fuelled
further speculation that it could be either a
form of nasal neuropathy or rhinitis hyster-
icus.4 In fact, ENS has not been given
enough attention. It is described as an
iatrogenic disease that can make affected
patients feel a paradoxical obstruction, and
some patients subjectively believe that the
operation was unsuccessful. In recent years,
some such patients have retaliated against
the surgeon, and others have even com-
mitted suicide as a result of their disabling
sinonasal symptoms. However, the common
etiologies, optimal management, and vari-
ous treatment options for ENS remain con-
troversial. Thus, investigation of ENS
treatment is necessary. Surgical therapy is
a safe and effective treatment modality for
patients with ENS, especially those with
poor outcomes of conservative treatment.
The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT) is a
validated survey that examines general nasal
symptoms and can be used to compare
preintervention and postintervention out-
comes. We used the SNOT to compare
preoperative and postoperative symptoms
excluding olfactory disturbances after place-
ment of various ENS implants. The purpose
of nasal surgery is to reduce the nasal cavity
volume, increase the nasal airway resistance,
and reconstruct the nasal anatomical
structure.
Recent studies have revealed that surgery
may result in clinical improvement in
patients with ENS but that it does not
guarantee improvement in all patients, and
insufficient evidence is available to favor any
particular implant material.5 Radical tur-
binate surgery is strongly opposed because
it results in ENS, while the safety and
low invasiveness partial turbinectomy are
guaranteed. Surgical treatment of ENS is
technically difficult, and the outcome is
poor. Some studies have indicated that
different materials have different treatment
effects. The nasal airway resistance must be
increased by narrowing the nasal valve
region or reconstructing a pseudoturbinate
in patients with ENS. Some researchers
have found that acellular dermis grafts are
reliable, predictable, and readily shaped.6
Placement of Medpor implants (Stryker,
Kalamazoo, MI) in patients with ENS is
associated with statistically significant
improvements in disease-specific quality-of-
life measures.7 Some studies have revealed
that costal cartilage may be more useful than
conchal cartilage in endonasal microplasty
implants and in the treatment of patients
with ENS.8 Bastier et al.9 found that use of
a b-tricalcium phosphate implant to repair
the head of the inferior turbinate is safe
and efficient for restoration of nasal com-
fort. Different materials are used in ENS
implants to alleviate ENS symptoms. Thus,
whether and how ENS can be cured is
an important clinical question. Various
materials are used, but there is currently no
evidence that demonstrates the superiority
of any one material or technique. Therefore,
the present meta-analysis was performed
to evaluate the efficacy of implantation
of foreign material grafts (FGs) versus
autografts/allografts (AGs) in patients with
ENS. Additionally, because the efficacy of
nasal air conditioning differs among various
1940 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
countries,1 the curative effects of surgical
methods for ENS were compared to identify
any differences between China and other
countries. The results are expected to pro-
vide patients and clinicians with a realistic
viewpoint on surgical outcomes.
Methods
Search strategy
We consulted the Preferred Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines.10 A literature search
was conducted in MEDLINE (OVID
and PubMed), EMBASE (OVID), and the
Cochrane Library (Wiley) from 1 January
1990 to 1 June 2016 using the following key
words: ``empty nose syndrome,'' ``atrophic
rhinitis,'' ``implants,'' and ``transplanting.''
The literature search was limited to the
English language. The abstracts were
appraised for relevance, and full-text articles
were obtained as appropriate. The bibliog-
raphy of each article was reviewed to iden-
tify any other potentially relevant study. The
search covered the literature published from
the year the database was established to
1 June 2016. We used the SNOT to compare
preoperative and postoperative symptoms
after placement of ENS implants and attain-
ment of objective surgical outcomes by
radiologic examination, nasal air flow evalu-
ation, and endoscopic scoring.
Ethical considerations
All analyses were based on previously pub-
lished studies; thus, no ethical approval or
patient consent was required.
Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis
were as follows: (i) All patients had a clinical
diagnosis of ENS, had failed conservative
nasal hydration therapy, and had undergone
ENS implantation; (ii) the intervention
involved the implantation of AGs or FGs;
(iii) preoperative and postoperative param-
eters were compared; (iv) surgical outcomes
were assessed by the SNOT scores after
implantation; and (v) the study was a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) or obser-
vational study.
Exclusion criteria
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i)
Duplicate publications, case reports, animal
studies, reviews, and systematic reviews and
(ii) lack of a control group.
Data extraction
Data were extracted in duplicate by
two independent investigators (Drs. Yang
and Ke). Any disagreement was settled by
discussion with a third reviewer (Dr. Hu).
A third researcher was consulted when there
were discrepancies in the data, and agree-
ment was reached after discussion.
The following data were extracted from the
original studies: first author, year of publica-
tion, country, sample size, age, sex, surgery
allocation, study design, follow-up, surgery
technique, and SNOT scores.
Quality assessment
Quality assessment of the included RCTs was
performed using the Cochrane quality assess-
ment criteria.11 The prospective studies were
evaluated using the Newcastle­Ottawa quality
assessment scale.12 Two researchers con-
ducted a blinded quality assessment of the
included studies. When the researchers' assess-
ments were discrepant, a third researcher was
consulted for the final grading.
Statistical analyses
All analyses of outcomes were performed
with Review Manager software (ver. 5.2;
Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).
Ma et al. 1941
A Mantel­Haenszel fixed-effects model or
random-effects model was used to calculate
summary effect measures (risk ratio) with the
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI),
and forest plots were created. Homogeneity
was measured by the Cochrane 2 test.
Subgroup meta-analyses were performed
according to the implant material and
sources of different countries. The pooled
parameters were the 95% CI and relative risk
(RR). Publication bias was examined using
Begg's test and Egger's test.7 A sensitivity
analysis was completed by converting the
pooled results into a fixed-effects model.
Results
In total, 1612 publications were retrieved
from the electronic and manual searches. No
conference materials were retrieved. After
inputting the search limits (Title/Abstract,
non-English, and Date: 1 January 1990 to
1 June 2016), 265 publications remained.
After excluding articles on primary atrophic
rhinitis, 29 publications remained. Finally,
after excluding reviews and case reports, six
articles on ENS implantation remained. We
analyzed these studies and used the SNOT
to compare the preoperative versus post-
operative outcomes of patients with ENS.
Six publications involving 122 patients were
included in our meta-analysis2,4,7,13­15
(Figure 1). Of these, two studies were
RCTs and four were non-RCTs (Table 1).
We found that the overall kappa statistic
between AGs and FGs was 0.53 (95% CI,
0.85­0.21), while that between the China
group and other countries group was 0.47
(95% CI, 0.11­0.82).
In the forest plot of the SNOT scores, the
standardized mean difference for AGs
was 23.18 and that for FGs was 28.07
(Figure 3b), indicating that the treatment
effects of AGs were superior to those of

FGs. The standardized mean difference in
the China group was 27.50 while that in the
other countries group was 25.09 (Figure 3c),
indicating that more patients in China than
in other countries underwent surgical
implant therapy; this difference was statis-
tically significant (P < 0.05). As shown in
Figure 3a, Figure 3b, and Figure 3c, the
preoperative and postoperative SNOT
scores were obtained in all six clinical studies
involving implantation of AGs and FGs in
patients with ENS. Our meta-analysis was
carried out according to the sample sizes of
the patients, and the results showed statis-
tical significance with an interval variance of
26.13 (95% CI, 21.06­31.21). A significant
difference was observed in the preoperative
and postoperative SNOT scores between the
different implant groups (P < 0.05). There
was also a significant difference between
the preoperative and postoperative SNOT
scores for the different implants. In the
subgroup analysis of the implant materials,
there was a significant difference between
AG and FG (P < 0.05). With respect to the
country subgroups, there was a significant
difference in the effects of the China group
versus the other countries group (P < 0.05).
These results indicate that AGs are superior
to FGs based on SNOT outcomes.
Begg's test and Egger's test16,17 were
employed to examine the pooled values from
five or more studies. The results indicated no
publication bias in any of the analyzed data.
A sensitivity analysis (Figure 2a and Figure 2b)
was conducted for the pooled results by
converting the pooled model (fixed-effects
model). The implant materials and country
subgroups exhibited large differences in the
RRs and 95% CIs before and after surgery,
indicating instability in the pooled values for
these two subgroups (Table 2).
Discussion
In this meta-analysis, all patients reported
that their subjective symptoms were

improved, and a statistically significant
improvement in the SNOT scores was
achieved. We found a significant difference
between the preoperative and postoperative
SNOT scores in the different implants
(P < 0.05). In the subgroup analyses based
on implant materials, there was a significant
difference in AG and FG (P < 0.05); we also
found a significant difference between the
China group and the other countries group
(P < 0.05). The results of these subgroup
analyses indicate that AGs are superior to
FGs. We found that a greater number of
patients with ENS in China than in other
countries were treated by surgical implant
therapy.
ENS is a rare rhinologic disorder that
typically develops many years after sinonasal
surgery, most notably turbinate surgery.18
Effective treatment is necessary for patients
with ENS. All patients with ENS in the
present meta-analysis had undergone a pre-
vious inferior turbinectomy. This meta-ana-
lysis included six trials reporting the
postsurgical outcomes in patients with ENS
who were treated with different implants.
Besides the preoperative and postoperative
SNOT scores, the following factors were also
considered: implant material, country of
origin, and follow-up duration. The results
of these subanalyses provide evidence-based
practices for such surgeries and were statis-
tically significant with an interval variance of
26.13 in the forest plot (95% CI, 21.06­31.21,
P < 0.00001, I2 ¼ 0%) (Figure 3a). Patients
with ENS experienced significant

improvement in their symptoms after
implantation surgery. The results of the
subgroup analysis indicated that there was a
significant difference between AGs and FGs
after surgery (P < 0.05) (Figure 3b). We also
found a significant difference between China
and other countries (P < 0.05) (Figure 3c). In
one previous study, patients with silastic
implants and acellular dermis grafts showed
marked subjective and objective improve-
ments.2 In the comparison of the SNOT
outcomes between AGs and FGs, the sum-
mary effect measures were estimated by a
fixed-effects model. The I2 measure of het-
erogeneity for AGs was ¼ 0%, while that for
FGs was 34%, suggesting little heterogeneity
between the preoperative and postoperative
SNOT scores among the studies. The present
meta-analysis demonstrated that the SNOT
can be used as a comprehensive assessment
tool to aid in the evaluation of the effects of
turbinate reconstruction surgery in patients
with ENS, and the SNOT score can serve
as a comparative parameter before and
after surgery. Clinical diagnosis of ENS is
difficult because no reliable objective tests are
available; hence, the otolaryngologist must
rely on the patient's subjective symptoms.3
Some studies have indicated that sub-
mucosal implantation of Medpor (Stryker)
is a feasible surgical treatment for ENS.12
Other studies have shown that endonasal
microplasty by submucosal implantation of
cartilage may be a useful treatment option in
the management of ENS.19
Our results have potential implications
for clinical practice and health policies
regarding ENS. The SNOT scores were
significantly different from the preoperative
scores as shown by an interval variance
of 26.13 (95% CI, 21.06­31.21) (P < 0.05).
Although based on only six clinical trials, the
current findings indicate that the symptoms
of ENS were alleviated after the implant-
ation surgery; furthermore, there was differ-
ence between AGs and FGs. We consider
that ENS should not be overlooked, espe-
cially because it can severely affect certain
patients whose only presenting complaint
is nasal obstruction.20 The aim of treatment
is to increase the nasal airway resistance
by narrowing the nasal valve region or

reconstructing a pseudoturbinate by surgi-
cal intervention. Modrzynski21 reported that
hyaluronic acid injections appear to be worth
considering in less severe forms of ENS.
Graft material implanted below the
mucosa is a practical choice to reconstruct
the deficient anatomy in patients with ENS.22
Computational fluid dynamic studies of nasal
aerodynamics may have a role in planning
the placement and quantity of implants for
prediction of neonasal airflow in patients
with ENS.23 Nevertheless, surgeons must
employ a realistic but empathetic approach
that takes the current evidence regarding
surgical intervention into consideration.
Future studies are needed to establish the
efficacy and safety of the implant approach.
In this meta-analysis of randomized
observational studies, the heterogeneity of
the studies was estimated using the I2 test as
shown in Figure 2a and Figure 2b. We
found a low degree of heterogeneity among
the studies, indicating reliability of our
results. One limitation of our study is the
fact that the SNOT 20, SNOT 22, and
SNOT 25 comprise slightly different evalu-
ation items; however, these differences did
not affect the assessment of ENS symptoms
by the meta-analysis. A second potential
limitation involves the fact that only six
studies were included and that the sample
size was small after application of the
rigorous inclusion criteria and review pro-
cedures. This limitation is associated with a
high risk of false-positive results. Third, the
meta-analyses was performed to compare
subjective symptoms, not objective symp-
toms. Overall, evaluation of the efficacy of
AGs versus FGs in patients with ENS by a
meta-analysis is clinically useful. The results
are expected to be helpful for patients and
doctors in the clinical setting. Because we
demonstrated the superiority of AGs over
FGs based on a meta-analysis, we speculate
whether this justifies a change in the opera-
tive treatments of patients with ENS in the
future.
Conclusion
The present meta-analysis suggests that
surgery can improve the symptoms and
SNOT scores of patients with ENS. The
results also indicate that AGs are more
effective than FGs in patients with ENS
and that patients from China undergo sur-
gical implant therapy more frequently than
do patients from other countries.
