Background
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is not only an inevitable
adaptation to increased hemodynamic load in hypertension,
but it is one of the most important, strongest, and independ-
ent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
It has been postulated that left ventricular growth and struc-
ture have complex interactions with genetic, environmental,
and lifestyle control factors.1 LVH was first deemed a com-
plication of hypertension 150 years ago at autopsy, and by
chest X-ray in the following years. Over the years, electro-
cardiography has become the first choice for the definite
diagnosis of LVH, particularly in hypertensives.2 LVH was
diagnosed mainly by left ventricular mass (LVM) or left
ventricular mass index (LVMI) in ultrasonic cardiography.3
Between 30% and 70% of the population variability in
LVH appears to be genetically determined.4­6 In this way,

Abstract
Background: Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is one of the most studied candidate genes related to essential hypertension
(EH) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Some studies have focused on the relationship between -344C/T polymorphism
(rs1799998) in the CYP11B2 gene and LVH, but the results are controversial. This meta-analysis is purposed to reveal the
relationship between the -344C/T and the left ventricular structure and function, including left ventricular end diastolic
dimension (LVEDD), left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular mass/left ventricular mass index (LVM/
LVMI), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT), and interventricular septal wall thickness (IVS).
Methods: A literature search of PubMed and Embase databases was conducted on articles published before January 27,
2014. The odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Heterogeneity analyses were performed using meta-
regression. Tests for publication bias were also performed and biased studies should be removed from subsequent analyses.
Results: There were 20 studies with a total of 6780 subjects meeting the inclusion criteria. The main finding was that
concentration levels of LVEDD and LVESD were higher in CC homozygous individuals than in TT homozygous individuals
in the whole group. In the Asian subgroup, TT homozygous individuals had larger IVS than CC homozygous individuals.
In the Caucasian normotension subgroup, CC homozygous individuals had larger LVM/LVMI than TT homozygous
individuals. In the Asian essential hypertension subgroup, TT homozygous individuals had larger LVPWT values than CC
homozygous individuals.
Conclusions: The present findings support the hypothesis that CC homozygous individuals may have greater left
ventricular diameters (LVEDD and LVESD) regardless of their ethnicities or physical conditions.

variation in left ventricular structure is merited, and the
findings may generate insights into the pathogenesis of
cardiac hypertrophy. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system (RAAS) has been shown to influence myocardial
growth independently of hypertension, and it has been
speculated that the polymorphisms of genes coding this
system may explain the heritability of LVH.
Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is a key enzyme in
RASS. In 1998, Kupari et al. originally reported the
-344C/T polymorphism (rs1799998) in CYP11B2 was
associated with left ventricular size and LVM.7 Then a
large number of studies seeking to link the -344C/T poly-
morphism to LVH were conducted in individuals of differ-
ent races and ethnic groups using different statistical
models in various left ventricular structure and function
indicators, but the results have often been unreproduci-
ble.8­13 A meta-analysis regarding the relationship between
-344C/T and left ventricular size was published in 2008.
This meta-analysis covered 14 studies that were performed
mainly on Europeans, but in recent years, many studies
covering other ethnic groups, especially Asians, have been
published.14 In recent studies, sample size is much greater
than previously. Here, all available data were collected and
the influence of the -344C/T polymorphism on the left
ventricular structure and function, such as LVM, left ven-
tricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD), and left ven-
tricular end systolic diameter (LVESD), was systematically
evaluated.
Methods
Literature search
To identify all the studies that addressed the association
between CYP11B2 -344C/T polymorphism and left ven-
tricular structure and function, a systematic computerized
literature search of PubMed and Embase databases (up to
March 5, 2014) was conducted using the following key-
words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms:
(aldosterone synthase or CYP11B2) and (gene(s) or
variant(s) or polymorphism(s) or allele(s)) and (left ven-
tricular). Search results were limited to studies on human
subjects. We searched the articles without language limita-
tion. The full text of the retrieved studies was scrutinized,
and all of the references cited in the articles were searched
to identify potentially relevant studies. All the articles
were organized by year of publication and first author.
They were entered into a dedicated literature database.
Selection criteria. The studies had to meet all the following
criteria. Inclusion criteria: (1) The articles had to include at
least one of the following echocardiographically measured
traits: LVM, LVMI, left ventricular end diastolic volume
index (LVEDVI), LVEDD, left ventricular end systolic vol-
ume index (LVESVI), LVESD, left ventricular posterior
wall thickness (LVPWT), and interventricular septal wall
thickness (IVS). (2) Only research articles and clinical tri-
als were included. (3) Eligible articles had to provide suf-
ficient information to extract or calculate for the CYP11B2
-344C/T genotype number of subjects and the mean and
standard deviation (SD) of continuous left ventricular
structure/function indicators. (4) If the eligible article was a
case-control study, both case and control groups had to be
involved and the genotype distribution of control popula-
tion had to obey the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).
Duplicates were removed. Exclusion criteria: Studies
involving non-echocardiographically measured phenotypes
and studies assessed by magnetic resonance imaging were
excluded. Studies in patients with specific disorders, such
as renovascular diseases and renal dysfunction, were
ignored. Data based on follow-up studies involving phar-
macological interventions according to -344C/T were also
excluded.
Data extraction. Two investigators (LW, JZ) read through
all the research articles and extracted and calculated the
required statistics and relevant information independently.
Inconsistencies were discussed between the two investiga-
tors until a consensus was reached on all items. For all
studies included, the following information was collected:
year of publication, first author, country, journal, racial
makeup of the study population, demographics, sex, age,
sources of recruitment, character of participants (e.g. kinds
of diseases or healthy), allelic and genotypic frequencies
of the -344C/T, left ventricular phenotypes corresponding
to -344C/T, and confirmation of diagnosis. If allele fre-
quencies were not given, they were calculated from the
corresponding genotype frequencies of the case and the
control groups. All the eligible studies were ordered by
year of publication and then were entered into a dedicated
literature database. Mean ± SD was used for continuous
variables. The methodology of CYP11B2 -344C/T geno-
typing was treated as a possible confounding factor in the
statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis. Software R (http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/) and
Review Manager 5.0 (Oxford, UK) were used to enter
extracted data into a manageable database and for subse-
quent statistical analyses. Yu's method was used to calcu-
late the mean standardized difference, which was used to
assess inter-group differences independent of the unit of
measurement.4,14
Heterogeneity was tested using I square (I2). We used a
random-effects model to conduct all the comparisons.15
For the meta-regression, the dominant genetic model
and homozygote comparison model were mainly used.16
Dominant genetic models were used to compare the
phenotype values of TC+CC genotype individuals to
that of TT genotype individuals. Homozygote compari-
son models were used to compare the phenotype values
860 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
of CC genotype individuals to those of TT genotype
individuals. These values were found to be equal to
those of an additive genetic model with selective and
extreme genotypes. Empirically, the studies were
regrouped into subsets by ethnicity and physical condi-
tion and the meta-regression analyses were repeated for
the new subsets.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the
reliability of meta-regression results and to detect any
uncertainty.17 Sensitivity analyses were conducted by
sequentially deleting a single study each time in an attempt
to identify the influence of the individual data sets on
pooled effect sizes. If the point estimate of the combined
effect size with one study omitted lay outside the 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) of the estimate with all available
studies, then the study in question was considered to have
excessive influence and was omitted. In addition, a regres-
sion with confounding factors as covariates was also con-
ducted, and p values < 0.1 were considered statistically
significant.4
Publication bias was assessed using visual inspection of
funnel plots and the Egger regression intercept method. P
values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Asymmetrical funnel plots and p values < 0.05 of the cor-
responding Egger's test suggested obvious publication
bias.18,19

above were used, and 917 hits were generated in the
PubMed and Embase electronic databases. Reviews of the
titles found that 297 were not in humans, four were com-
ments and responses, and 98 were reviews. Reviews of the
abstracts resulted in exclusion of 497 studies because they
were outside the focus of the present work. A full paper

were excluded because their data were duplicated (n = 1)
or incomplete (n = 16). Because data regarding LVM, IVS,
LPWD, LVEDD, and LVESD from a study published by
Rao et al. in 2003 was also included in the study published
by the same team in 2004, the latter study was included in
the analysis.20,21 The remaining 16 studies contained no
matched phenotype or genotype data on any left ventricu-
lar echocardiography indicator. Ultimately, 20 studies met
the criteria. Characteristics of the 20 included studies are
listed in Table 1. Most of them were published from 1998
to 2007, one in 2011, and one in 2012. Thirteen studies
were performed on Caucasians, six on Asians, and one
study on a United States (US) population. Three-quarters
of the studies were hospital based.9,11­13,22­31 One-quarter
were population based.7,8,32,33,25 Eighteen studies used
patients who suffered from cardiovascular disease (CVD).
There were three ethnicities: 13 studies included Caucasian
subjects, six studies includedAsian subjects, and one study
consisted of 279 whiteAmerican subjects. HWE tests were
performed for each study, and all were found to be in
equilibrium.
The genotyping of CYP11B2 -344C/T polymorphism
was mainly carried out across studies using polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP) followed by digestion with the restriction
enzyme Hae III in 16 studies. One study was genotyped

using allele-specific oligonucleotides.25 One study was
genotyped by Taqman assay.27 Two studies did not men-
tion what method had been used (Table 1). However, the
genotyping methods did not show any obvious confound-
ing effect. In the eligible case-control studies, all the con-
trol populations obeyed HWE.
LVM/LVMI
There were 17 studies included in the present analysis of
LVM/LVMI. A comparison of 5649 individuals who pro-
vided relevant data about LVM was performed (Table 2).
Fifteen studies were evaluated (pe
= 0.1288, pheterogeneity
<
0.01) for the differences in LVM between TT homozygotes
and CC homozygotes (1337 vs 846). Seventeen studies (pe
= 0.2642, pheterogeneity
< 0.01) were used to compare TT to
TC+CC (1976 vs 3673). There was no significant publica-
tion bias, but significant heterogeneity was detected among
the reports. Then TT and CC/TC+CC were compared
across different ethnicities with respect to essential hyper-
tension (EH) and normotension (NM). No statistically sig-
nificant differences were detected when the LVM/LVMI of
TT and CC/TC+CC were compared, even in the EH and
NM subgroups (see Figures 2 and 3). The comparison
results were not significantly different under the allele
model (C/T).
In order to confirm the source of heterogeneity, regres-
sion analyses of echocardiographic LVM/LVMI were per-
formed. The contrast between TT and CC is shown in
Table 3. Table 3 summarizes the results of regression
according to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
-344C/T, ethnicity, country, design of included studies,
number of included studies, age, sex, character of partici-
pants, prevalence of EH, year of publication, body mass
index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP). The regression analyses showed the
following: LVM/LVMI could be affected by the number of
studies (p = 0.04), study design (p = 0.06), sex (p = 0.09),
and BP (pSBP
= 0.05, pDBP
= 0.09). When the heterogeneity
of any studies with respect to number of participants n <
200, or n > 200, ethnicity, or EH and NM was close to zero
(Figure 3). CC was associated with larger LVM values
than TT (pheterogeneity
= 0.53, I2 = 0%, pvalue
= 0.02, 95% CI
-0.52 (-0.97, -0.07)) in the n < 200 NM Caucasian sub-
group (Kupari7, Delles8). No difference in LVM between
TT and CC/TC+CC was observed in any other subgroup.
For the sensitivity analyses, one study was omitted at a
time and the pooled SD was recalculated. The mean differ-
ence of the remaining studies was also calculated. No study
was found to move the point estimate outside the 95% CI.
IVS
No significant publication bias was detected in the contrast
of IVS with TT and CC/TC+CC. There were 13 eligible
studies (2048 individuals) in the analysis of IVS and com-
parison of TT and CC. No significant difference was
detected for the total group (p = 0.08). The results were
also not significant in the NM or EH subgroups (pNM
=
0.87 and pEH
= 0.32). After adjustment for ethnicity as a
covariate, the results became significant. When regression
was performed for IVS under the homozygote comparison,
age, sex, character, year of publication, SBP, and DBP
were found to affect the results of the IVS comparison.
There was no significant result under the allele model
(C/T) in IVS.
Sensitivity analyses for IVS showed that no single
study could affect the results of the comparison between
TT and CC or TC+CC.
LVEDD
A total of 14 studies were available for comparison of TT
and CC (1383 vs 857 individuals). There were 17 studies
available for comparison of TT and TC + CC (1738 vs
3401 individuals). There was obvious publication bias (pe
= 0.0312) for LVEDD under the TT vs TC+CC genetic
model. Sensitivity analyses were performed and results
showed that a part of one multi-center study could change
the total LVEDD comparison results between TT and CC/
TC+CC.32 The publication bias disappeared after this part
of the study was removed (TT vs CC, pe
= 0.16; TT vs
TC+CC, Pe
= 0.39). The report in question showed this
group of participants to be older (25­74 years old) and the
age distribution to be more balanced within each decade
group than in other studies. The LVEDD of the two parts
showed obvious heterogeneity. The pooled LVEDD com-
parison is shown in Figure 4 (TT vs CC, 95% CI -0.60
(-1.15, -0.06, pvalue
= 0.03; TT vs TC+CC, 95% CI -0.17
(-0.49, 0.15), pvalue
= 0.29). CC was found to have a larger
LVEDD than TT. Covariate regression analyses showed
that country, number, age, characteristics of participants,
EH, and DBP could affect the LVEDD results in the
homozygote comparison. When removing the major case
of heterogeneity (Olcay30) from the EH group, the results
showed that CC had larger LVEDD values than TT (phetero-
geneity
= 0.96, I2 = 0%, 95% CI -0.86 (-1.14, -0.59), pvalue
<
0.0001). Under the C/T allelic model, the C allele had
larger LVEDD than the T allele in the EH subset8,27 (I2 = 0,
pheterogeneity
= 0.7, pvalue
< 0.0001, 95% CI -0.54 (-0.79,
-0.30)).
LVESD
Ten studies were included for comparison of TT vs CC
(1121 vs 694 individuals). P values were 0.50, 0.65, and
0.004 for the total, NM, and EH groups, respectively. For
comparison of TT vs TC+CC, 12 studies were included
(1196 vs 2232). Publication bias was observed in the con-
trast of LVESD between TT and TC+CC (pe
= 0.04).

Results of sensitivity analyses for LVESD under the
homozygote comparison and the dominant genetic model
showed that Schunkert, 1999­3 could change the overall
results of LVESD comparison.32 If Schunkert, 1999­3 was
omitted, then the publication bias disappeared (TT vs CC,
pe
= 0.86, TT vs TC+CC, pe
= 0.19), and CC had larger
LVESD values than TT (pheterogeneity
< 0.01, pvalue
= 0.002,
95% CI -0.71 (-1.16, -0.26)). No differences in LVESD
were found during a comparison of other groups under the
dominant genetic model and the homozygote comparison.
Wang et al. 865
After covariate regression for LVESD under the homozy-
gote comparison, number of participants, age, sex, charac-
teristics, year of publication, SBP, and DBP were all found
to affect the results of the LVESD comparison. In the n >
200 EH subgroup (Isaji,28 Stella27), CC had larger LVESD
than TT (pheterogeneity
= 0.15, pvalue
< 0.0001, 95% CI -1.02
(-1.45, -0.60)). Under the C/T allelic model, the C allele
had larger LVESD values than the T allele in the EH sub-
set8,27 (I2 = 0, pheterogeneity
= 0.39, pvalue
< 0.0001, 95% CI
-0.72 (-0.97, -0.47)).
LVPWT
There were 10 studies included for the LVPWT and a
total of 1484 TTs vs 734 CCs. P values of 0.13, 0.98, and
0.06 were recorded for the total, NM, and EH groups,
respectively. As for comparison of TT vs (TC+CC), 12
studies were included (1524 vs 2951). P values of 0.51,
0.74, and 0.21 were recorded for the three groups. Under
the homozygote comparison, covariate regression results
demonstrated that ethnicity, country, design, number of
participants, age, sex, and participant characteristics
could affect the results of the LVPWT comparison. In the
n < 200 EH subgroup, TT was associated with larger
LVPWT values than CC (pheterogeneity
= 0.74, pvalue
= 0.02,
95% CI 0.67 (0.12, 1.22)).8,30
Discussion
This is a systematic review of the literature in the form of
an update meta-analysis of the association between the
CYP11B2 -344C/T polymorphism (rs1799998) and left
ventricular structure. In total, 20 studies and 6780 sub-
jects were analyzed for left ventricular parameters. The
main finding of the present meta-analysis was that echo-
cardiographic left ventricular diameters (LVEDD and
LVESD) were greater in CC than in TT on average
(involving 17 studies). CC individuals had larger LVM/
LVMI ratios than TT individuals in the subgroup of NM
Caucasians (n < 200). Among Asians, TT had larger IVS
than CC, and TT had larger LVPWT than CC in the much
smaller sample (n < 200) EH subgroup without heteroge-
neity (pheterogeneity
> 0.05, pvalue
< 0.01, respectively). There
was no obvious heterogeneity among the subgroups. The
same allele (e.g. the C allele) of rs1799998 was found to
have different effects in different populations. No publi-
cation bias was detected in any these results. The same
results showed CC to be associated with larger left ventri-
cle diameter than TT in the non-heterogeneity subgroup
analyses. Statistical differences were observed among
continuous echocardiographic variables only during com-
parisons of homozygotes.
In 2008, Sookoian et al. reported that the CYP11B2
-344T allele was associated with an increased thickness of

the posterior wall of the left ventricle.14 Other studies have
shown the -344T allele to be associated with greater IVS
and PWT values. The previous version of the present meta-
analysis contained 14 studies and more than 4000 individu-
als. The main limit of that study was that it did not contain
any Chinese or other Asian individuals, with the exception
of one study that was performed on Japanese participants.
The present meta-analysis was consistent with a 2008
report by Sookoian et al. among small subgroups (n < 200),
but this relationship was not detected when the groups were
pooled. One of the reasons for this may be that the more
groups pooled, the more confounding factors there were.
Most of those confounding factors were not recorded, so
the association results may be different or biased.
Because of the heterogeneity present, sensitivity analy-
ses and covariance regression analyses were performed to
identify the main factors capable of affecting the results.
Ethnicity, sample size, age, sex, participant characteristics,
study design, DBP, and SBP could all influence the results.
Patients were regrouped according to ethnicity, sample
size, and other characteristics. CC was still associated with
larger LVEDD and LVESD values in the subsets with
pheterogeneity
> 0.05, pvalue
< 0.05 during the comparison of
homozygotes. These results suggested that the CC geno-
type of rs1799998 might be associated with larger left ven-
tricular diameter.
Aldosterone independently influences the vascular envi-
ronment in humans. It does so by affecting structural and
functional modification of the arterial wall as derived from
mineralocorticoid receptors.35 Aldosterone has endocrine
properties. These properties may contribute to the patho-
physiology of cardiac fibrosis, cardiovascular dysfunction,

and progressive renal dysfunction.36­38 Recent evidence has
shown that aldosterone may play an important role in
potentiating some of the hypertrophic effects of angiotensin
II on cultured vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells. Those
cells showed evidence of mRNA for CYP11B2.36­38
Aldosterone increases the synthesis of collagen I at the
mRNAand protein level.39 And aldosterone receptor block-
ade using spironolactone markedly reduces procollagen
type III amino-terminal peptide. All these results suggest
that aldosterone is a key point of collagen turnover.39 Some
investigations have shown the expression of CYP11B2

mutation could cause hypertension in otherwise phenotypi-
cally normal animals or humans.42 The polymorphism
-344C/T is located upstream of the start of translation
within a binding site for the transcription factor, steroido-
genic factor-1 (SF-1). SF-1 is necessary for the develop-
ment of adrenal glands and other steroidogenic tissues and
for expression of most of the enzymes involved in adrenal
steroid biosynthesis;7 -344C/T is located in the promoter of
the CYP11B2 gene and might influence the gene expression
by affecting the binding of the SF-1 transcription factor. A
previous study showed that the -344C allele binds to the
SF-1 binding site more strongly than the T allele does in
vitro.43 Several studies have shown that BP is higher in CC
and TC than in TT individuals. Some studies have also
shown the -344C allele to be associated with increased left
ventricular size and decreased baroreflex sensitivity in
healthy people.44 This supports the results of the present
meta-analysis with respect to the NM Caucasian subgroup
with n < 200 (CC had larger LVM/LVMI than TT, pheterogene-
ity
= 0.53, I2 = 0%, pvalue
= 0.02).
Kupair et al. observed that LVM increased with the
number of copies of -344C in young adults.7 Delles et al.
also found that CCs had greater LVEDD than those with
the TTs in arterial hypertension, suggesting that CC geno-
type might be associated with early LVH.8 A recent, large,
genome-wide association study of BP traits also supported
the association between BP traits and CYP11B2 -344C/
T.45 Those results showed that the -344C allele may be
more strongly associated with large left ventricular size.
In the present study, differences were found only during
comparisons of homozygotes (additive genetic model with
selective/extreme genotypes) in LVM, IVS, LVEDD,
LVESD, and LVPWT. Under the dominant model, no sig-
nificant association was detected between the CYP11B2
-344C/T polymorphism and left ventricular structure.
Homozygote/extreme genotypes showed extreme pheno-
types, and additive genetic models with selective/extreme
genotypes may have more power. The present meta-
analysis was also performed using the recessive model
(TT+TC vs CC). No significant differences were found
even in subset analyses.
The present results have to be interpreted within the
context of their limitations. First, there was detectable het-
erogeneity among studies. To reduce the effect of hetero-
geneity, studies were regrouped according to covariate
regression analyses. An association was found between all
five left ventricular structure traits and CYP11B2 -344C/T
in some sub-group analyses without heterogeneity (phetero-
geneity
> 0.05). The results of subgroup heterogeneity may
be more reliable than the results of the total group with
heterogeneity. Second, there was publication bias for stud-
ies reported on the association of LVEDD or LVESD with
CYP11B2 -344C/T. Publication bias may lead to overesti-
mation of pooled association between these two traits and
CYP11B2 -344C/T. Strictly speaking, only the estimations
of pooled association on LVM, IVS, and LVPWT were
credible. Last, we searched PubMed and Embase data-
bases. Some studies could not be searched in these two
databases, including some in local languages, and could
not be included in our study. Because of this, the recall
ratio of literature retrieval might be affected.
Through covariate regression analyses under homozy-
gote comparison, sample size, age, sex, patient character-
istics, design, DBP, and SBP were found to influence the
left ventricular echocardiographic variables in addition to
ethnicity. In the table of covariate regression analyses
(Table 3), number of participants, age, sex, participant
characteristics, year of publication, DBP, and SBP showed
significant differences (p < 0.05) in at least two left ven-
tricular structure traits out of the five, which indicated that
many factors besides ethnicity could also affect the left
ventricular structure, and different traits may be affected
by different factors.
In conclusion, the present findings support the hypoth-
esis that CC individuals of rs1799998 may have higher left
ventricular diameter (LVEDD, LVESD) regardless of eth-
nicity or physical conditions. The same allele (e.g. the C
allele of rs1799998) may play different roles in different
populations, but this merits deeper study. Confounding
factors, such as the sample number, age bracket, sex ratio,
characteristics of the participants, year of publication, and
BP were found influence to the results of the association
analyses (all p < 0.05).
