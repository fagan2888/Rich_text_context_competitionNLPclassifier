Across-culturalsurveywasusedtoexaminetwohypothesesdesignedtolinkculturetowellbeing
and health. The first hypothesis states that people are motivated toward prevalent cultural
mandates of either independence (personal control) in the United States or interdependence
(relational harmony) in Japan. As predicted, Americans with compromised personal control
and Japanese with strained relationships reported high perceived constraint. The second
hypothesis holds that people achieve wellbeing and health through actualizing the respective
cultural mandates in their modes of being. As predicted, the strongest predictor of wellbeing
and health was personal control in the United States, but the absence of relational strain in
Japan. All analyses controlled for age, gender, educational attainment, and personality traits.
The overall pattern of findings underscores culturally distinct pathways (independent versus
interdependent) in achieving the positive life outcomes.

self as efficacious and in-control, while the interdependent mode
of being (which is fostered in Asian cultural contexts) highlights
responsiveness to the needs and expectations of social others and
a resulting sense of the self as harmoniously connected to others
with minimal strain and tension.
The aim of the present work is to shed a new light on the link
between culture and wellbeing. Building on an extensive literature
that conceptualizes motivation and goals as vital aspects of the
self-system or modes of being (e.g., Greenwald, 1982; Gollwitzer
and Wicklund, 1985; Cantor and Kihlstrom, 1987), we have two
primary hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that goals derive from
culturally prevalent ideas and practices and that people are moti-
vated toward these primary cultural mandates, namely, personal
control(andthusindependence) intheUnitedStatesand relational
harmony (and thus interdependence) in Japan. We will test this
motivation hypothesis by assessing the degree to which people fail-
ing to achieve the respective cultural mandates feel constrained and
report that they"cannot do what they want to do."Second, we will
also test the hypothesis that people achieve wellbeing and health
in part through approaching their respective cultural mandates.
Whereas in American cultural contexts wellbeing and health will
be realized through high levels of personal control and mastery,
in Japanese cultural contexts wellbeing and health will be realized
through high levels of relational harmony.

Introduction
How people arrive at a sense of wellbeing including an appropriate
sense of the self and good quality social ties varies with the socio-
cultural context (Diener et al., 1999; Kitayama and Markus, 2000;
Westerhof et al., 2001). This literature indicates that the sociocul-
turally constructed environment (composed of patterns of mean-
ings,practices and products) provides blueprints for what it is that
people are expected to do in their life and how they are expected
to do so. We therefore expect that there are multiple sociocultur-
ally distinct pathways to wellbeing. Two such pathways have been
characterized as independent and interdependent (Kitayama and
Markus,2000;Greenfield etal.,2003).Drawing on this overarching
hypothesis, the present work investigated the cultural patterning
of independence and interdependence in Japan and the US, and
further probed the links of these cultural blueprints to reported
wellbeing and health.
Markus, Kitayama, and colleagues have suggested that differ-
ent cultural contexts value, sanction, and foster independence and
interdependence to varying degrees in organizing social practices
(e.g.,scripted patterns of social interaction),institutions (e.g.,sys-
tems of employment and promotion), and public meanings (e.g.,
icons and symbols) in many different domains of life (Kitayama
and Uskul, in press; Markus and Kitayama, 1991, 2010). By attun-
ing themselves to the structured set of cultural practices and
meanings, individuals develop correspondingly different modes
of engaging in a variety of actions Â­ both personal (e.g., express-
ing the self) and interpersonal (e.g., relating to others and being
friends with them). According to this analysis, the constructs of
independence and interdependence refer to culturally divergent
systems of action or modes of being. Specifically, the independent
mode of being (which is fostered in American cultural contexts)
emphasizes pursuit of personal goals and an attendant sense of the

Kitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing
Americans are strongly motivated toward personal control and,
thus, independence in general (our first hypothesis), they would
also be expected to achieve wellbeing and health through the path-
way of independence, that is, that of maintaining and enhancing
personalcontrol.Althoughimportant,promotionof relationalhar-
mony or avoidance of relational strain is considered to be more
discretionary. In fact, such relational goals are often secondary,
particularly when they are in direct conflict with the personal goals
of attaining the sense of control and mastery (Heckhausen and
Schultz, 1995).
Several studies have demonstrated that a strong sense of per-
sonal control is positively predictive of wellbeing and health in
the United States (e.g., Lachman and Weaver, 1998; Heckhausen
and Schulz, 1999). In addition, the sense of personal control is
likely to yield a strong sense of self-worth or high self-esteem. A
large number of studies have shown that self-esteem and, thus, an
attendant tendency to self-enhance through social comparison are
major predictors of wellbeing among Americans (e.g., Kwan et al.,
1997; Taylor and Brown, 1988; Diener and Diener, 1995; Uchida
et al., 2008). Likewise, positive feelings based on personal success
such as pride and feelings of superiority are highly associated with
generalhappinessamongAmericans(Kitayamaet al.,2000,2006b).
Additionally, Oishi and Diener (2001) report that attaining per-
sonal goals (e.g.,doing what one wants to do) leads to an enhanced
wellbeing among European Americans.
Incontrast,Asiansaremotivatedtowardrelationalharmonyand,
thus, interdependence in general (our first hypothesis). Further,
unlikeAmericans,wholinkhappinesstopersonalhappiness,Asians
associatehappinesswithrelationalharmony(UchidaandKitayama,
2009).Wethereforeexpectedthattheywouldachievewellbeingand
health through the interdependent pathway, that is, by promot-
ing relational harmony and/or avoiding relational strain (Morling
et al., 2002). Although important, attaining and maintaining the
sense of personal control and mastery is not considered essential
or primary. Indeed, especially when they are in direct conflict with
relational concerns and goals,they must be subordinated under the
ever-important interdependent concerns and goals. Those failing
to do so are often considered as immature and childish (Lebra,
1976; Kondo, 1990).
As may be expected,wellbeing in Asian contexts is strongly pre-
dicted by social relational factors such as social harmony (Kwan
et al.,1997; Kang et al.,2003),attainment of relational goals (Oishi
and Diener,2001),socially engaging emotions such as friendly feel-
ings and feelings of respect (Kitayama et al., 2000, 2006b), and
perceivedemotionalsupportfromcloseothers(Uchidaetal.,2008).
Thehypothesizedlinkof relationalharmonywithwellbeingamong
Asians has also been suggested by the finding that attaining rela-
tional goals (e.g., meeting expectations of significant others) is
related closely to an enhanced wellbeing among Asian Americans
and Japanese, but not among European Americans (Oishi and
Diener, 2001).
To extend the above evidence on cross-cultural variation in
wellbeing, the present work addressed three issues. First, currently
available cross-cultural evidence comes nearly exclusively from
samples of college students, which leaves open the applicability
of the cultural psychological theories to wider populations. We
thus tested age-heterogeneous samples of adults in both Japan and
of being. As a measure of interdependence we used scales indexing
relational harmony with significant others such as family members
and friends and a scale indexing relational strain with these others.
Cultural Motivations toward Independence and
Interdependence
The first hypothesis states that Americans are strongly motivated
toward independence and Japanese are strongly motivated toward
interdependence.In testing it,we draw on the well-established prin-
ciplethatwhenpeoplearemotivatedtowardgivengoalstatesinclud-
ing independence from others or interdependence with others, the
motivationmaybeparticularlyevidentwhenthegoalisblocked.This
principleisapplicabletoavarietyof domainsfromanimalbehaviors
to human social motivations. In a well-conducted field experiment,
for example, Harris (1974) demonstrated that people in a waiting
line are highly frustrated (often resulting in aggressive behaviors)
when someone cuts into the line (thereby interfering with their goal
attainment) and this was especially so when they were near the front
(asopposedtotheend)of theline.Whenpeoplearenearthefrontof
the line the goal gradient is assumed to be quite steep and the drive
toward the goal is high (see Berkowitz, 1989, for a review).
Onthebasisof thisliterature,onemightexpectthatpeopleshould
feel especially restrained and frustrated when the culturally sanc-
tionedgoalsof eitherindependenceorinterdependenceareblocked.
So far,we know of no data that directly speak to this possibility even
withstandardcollegestudentsamples.Wethustestedwhetherpeople
wouldinfactexperienceadegreeof restraintandfeelthatthey"could
not do what they wanted to do"when a key cultural motivation was
blocked. We expected that Americans would feel most constrained
whentheirpursuitof personalcontrolwasblocked.Incontrast,they
would not feel particularly constrained when they failed to attain
relational harmony or to avoid relational strain.Given that the ideas
and practices of interdependence are not as widely distributed in
American contexts as in Japanese contexts, many Americans would
notbeasstronglymotivatedtowardinterdependenceand,therefore,
would not feel thwarted as much as Japanese under such conditions
of blocked interdependence. Conversely, we expected that Japanese
would experience a degree of constraint and feel that they "could
not do what they wanted to do" when their goals of promoting
relational harmony and/or avoiding relational strain were blocked.
In contrast, they would not feel particularly constrained when they
were
preventedfromattainingpersonalcontrolormastery.Japanese
would not be strongly motivated toward independence and, as a
consequence, they would not be frustrated as much under such

conditions of blocked independence.
To measure the sense of constraint that arises when one's impor-
tant cultural goals and concerns are blocked and disrupted,we used
a scale designed to assess the degree to which people chronically
experience constraint (called the perceived constraint scale;Pearlin
and Schooler, 1978; Lachman and Weaver, 1998). Sample items
include "I cannot do what I want to do" and "There is really no
way I can solve the problems I have."
Cultural Pathways to Wellbeing
Whereas our first hypothesis was focused on motivation toward
independence or interdependence,our second hypothesis was con-
cerned with predictors of wellbeing and health. Because North

Measures
Thequestionnairesusedineachcountryincludedscalesdesignedto
measure(1)independence,(2)interdependence,(3)perceivedcon-
straint, and (4) wellbeing and health. Independence was assessed
with scales of personal mastery (four items, Pearlin and Schooler,
1978; Lachman and Weaver, 1998;  = 0.69 and.55 for Americans
and Japanese, respectively) and domain-specific control (one item
each, asking the amount of control perceived for each of seven
domains such as work, finance, and family;  = 0.70 and 0.67).
Interdependence was assessed with scales designed to measure har-
monious or non-conflictual social relations including (1) relational
harmony with family members (four items;  = 0.82 and 0.85),(2)
relational strain with family members (four items;  = 0.80 and
0.79),(3) relational harmony with friends (four items;  = 0.82 and
0.85), and (4) relational strain with friends (four items;  = 0.80
and 0.79; Whalen and Lachman, 2000). The chronic experience of
perceived constraint was measured with an 8-item scale developed
by Lachman and Weaver (1998) ( = 0.86 and 0.80).
To assess wellbeing and health,four separate categories of meas-
ures were employed:judgments of life satisfaction,hedonic wellbe-
ing, eudaimonic wellbeing, and physical health. Life satisfaction
was assessed with four items measuring satisfaction in different
domains; = 61 and 67);whereas hedonic wellbeing was measured
with affect balance computed by subtracting an average score of 6
negative affect ratings from that of 6 positive affect ratings;Mrozek
and Kolarz, 1998; negative affect  = 0.87 and 0.87, positive affect
 = 0.91 and 0.94). Eudaimonic wellbeing was measured by com-
puting the average of the scale scores for four of six dimensions of
psychological wellbeing (PWB, Ryff and Keyes, 1995; self-accept-
ance,purposeinlife,personalgrowth,andautonomy).Theremain-
ing two PWB dimensions (environmental mastery and positive
relation with others) were excluded because of conceptual overlap
with the independence and interdependence predictor variables.
Finally,indices of physical health included: (1) subjective health (1
item), (2) number of chronic health problems (maximum of 29;
reverse-coded, e.g., diabetes), (3) frequency of somatic symptoms
(maximum of 11; reverse-coded,e.g.,headaches),and (4) sensitiv-
ity to unpleasant sensations (called somatic amplification,5 items,
reverse-coded; Barsky et al., 1988;  = 0.55 and 0.56). A principal
component factor analysis performed on these health measures
showed a robust single factor solution in both cultures. All factor
loadings were substantial (>0.60).The factor score was used as our
measure of health.
We used gender and age as control variables as well as the five
personality trait scores of agreeableness (assessed with five trait
adjectives taken from John, 1990;  = 0.80 and 0.84), extraversion
(five adjectives;  = 0.78 and 0.82), neuroticism (four adjectives;
 = 0.74 and 0.68),conscientiousness (four adjectives;  = 0.58 and
0.39), and openness to experience (seven adjectives;  = 0.77 and
0.82).All scales had reasonable reliabilities in both countries, with
an exception of the Japanese  for conscientiousness (= 0.39).
Results
Ouranalysisproceededinthreesteps.First,wedimensionalizedinde-
pendenceandinterdependence.Second,wetestedthefirstof ourtwo
major hypotheses, namely, that whereas Americans are motivated
toward personal control and,more generally,toward independence,
the United States. This is the first effort we know of to extend the

current knowledge on cultural variation in self and wellbeing to
such samples of age and socioeconomically diverse adults from
different countries.
Second, one important shortcoming of existing cross-cultural
work in this area is that nearly all studies focus exclusively on
psychological measures of wellbeing, with scant attention paid to
healthoutcomes.Wefilledthisgapintheliteraturebyincorporating
reports of physical health and somatic symptoms.Furthermore,we
broadened the assessment of wellbeing to include not only general
evaluative judgments of wellbeing (e.g.,life satisfaction;Kwan et al.,
1997;Kang et al.,2003),or overall hedonic wellbeing (e.g.,reported
happiness,Kitayama et al.,2000,2006b),but also eudaimonic well-
being, which involves assessments of purpose and meaning in life,
personal growth, and self-acceptance (Ryff and Keyes, 1995).
Third,although wellbeing and health have been frequently pre-
dicted by individual difference variables, such as personality traits
(SchmutteandRyff,1997;DienerandLucas,1999)andeducational
attainment (Lachman and Weaver, 1998), contemporary work on
culture and wellbeing rarely includes these variables in analytic
designs, leaving open the possibility that observed cultural varia-
tions might be confounded by cultural differences in personality
profiles (McCrae et al.,1998) and educational attainment.We thus
controlled for both self-assessed traits and educational attainment
in tests of the above relationships so as to sharpen the focus on the
constructs of independence and interdependence as predictors of
wellbeing and health.
Materials and Methods
Participants and Procedure
We recruited a convenience sample of 482 adult Japanese in midlife
(199 males and 283 females; age range = 26Â­74; mean age = 51)
both in Tokyo (the capital and the largest metropolitan area in
Japan) and Sapporo (a regional center of a Northern island of
Japan Â­ Hokkaido). In Tokyo participants were recruited through
adult education classes offered by the pertinent municipalities,
whereas in Sapporo they were recruited through college students,
who requested their adult family members (mostly parents and
grandparents but in some cases older siblings) to fill out the ques-
tionnaire.All participants completed a self-administered question-
naireathomeandreturneditafteraweek.Whilenotrepresentative,
the Japanese sample covers a wide age range and varied educational
attainment levels, and importantly, was not based on college stu-
dents, the most common group sampled in the current literature.
Data from this Japanese sample was compared with the national
survey of Midlife Development in the US (MIDUS), which is
comprised of 3032 adults (1471 males and 1561 females; age
range=25Â­74;meanage=47).Respondentswererecruitedthrough
random-digit dialing procedures and then participated in a tele-
phone interview, followed by the completion of self-administered
questionnaires, which were returned by mail. Whereas 29.6% of
Americans had a college degree or higher, 32.8% of Japanese had
comparable levels of educational attainment.The percent of people
who were married was far greater in Japan than in the US (92% vs.
64%).Allscales,originallydevelopedinEnglish,weretranslatedinto
Japanese.Back-translationwasusedtoachieveequivalentmeanings
in the two languages. The Japanese version was used in Japan.

it, while Americans would feel constrained when they were

prevented from attaining what they were habitually aiming at,
namely, a strong sense of personal control, efficacy, mastery, and
self-esteem. We used a step-wise regression to predict the per-
ceived constraint score as a function of personal control,relational
harmony, and relational strain. In the first step in the regression,
four demographic variables (gender,age,culture,and educational
attainment [college degree or higher vs. some college or lower)
were entered.In the second step we entered five personality traits.
Third, we entered the three variables pertaining to independ-
ence (personal control) and interdependence (relational harmony
and relational strain). In the last step, three interaction terms
between the independence/interdependence variables and culture
were entered.
As can be seen in Table 2, each step accounted for a significant
amount of variance. Regarding the control variables, women were
more likely than men to experience constraint and perceived con-
straint also tended to increase as a function of age while decreas-
ing with educational attainment. Perceived constraint also tended
to be higher for Japanese than for Americans. Both agreeableness
and neuroticism were positively associated with perceived con-
straint, while conscientiousness and openness to experience were
negatively associated with perceived constraint. Higher levels of
educational attainment were associated with a reduced sense of
constraint. Interestingly, however, this effect was observed only
among Americans,  = -0.09, t
(2890)
= 6.29, p < 0.0001. Among
Japanese, the effect was no different from zero,  = 0.03, t < 1.
The interaction between culture and educational attainment was
significant,  = 0.051, t
(3349)
= 2.55, p < 0.02.
Most importantly,and beyond the effects of these control vari-
ables, the variables related to the cultural mandates of independ-
ence and interdependence had systematic effects on perceived
constraint and, moreover, these effects were often moderated
by culture.
Japanesearemotivatedtowardrelationalharmonyand,moregener-
ally,toward interdependence.Third,we examined the second major
hypothesis,whichholdsthatindividualsachievewellbeingandhealth
through living up to the major mandates of their own cultures.
Dimensionalizing Independence and Interdependence
We operationalized independence in terms of personal control
(personal mastery and domain-specific control) and interdepend-
ence in terms of social harmony (the presence of positive responses
from family members and friends and the absence of negative
responses from family members and friends). We first performed
a principal components factor analysis on the eight relevant scales
within each country.
In both the US and Japan,a three-factor structure was judged to
beoptimal.First,threefactorshadeigenvaluesof eithergreaterthan
1 or, very close to 1. Second, in both cases, after varimax rotation,
the three-factor solution was clearly interpretable and conceptually
identical.We performed the same analysis on different segments of
data within each country. All these analyses replicated essentially
the same three-factor solution.
The American solution is summarized in the left-side panel of
Table1.The three factors were clearly interpretable as (1)"relational
strain"(negative family relations, and negative friend relations), (2)
"relational harmony" (positive family relations and positive friend
relations), and (3) "personal control" (defined in terms of personal
mastery, and domain-specific control). The control factor corre-
spondedtoouroperationaldefinitionof independence,whereasthe
remaining two factors corresponded to our operational definition
of interdependence. The Japanese solution is given in the right-side
panel of Table 1. The three factors were clearly interpretable as (1)
relationalharmony,(2)relationalstrain,and(3)personalcontrol.For
each participant, relevant scale means were averaged to yield scores
for personal control, relational harmony, and relational strain.
MotivationtowardPersonalControlandRelationalHarmony
If the Japanese were truly motivated toward relational harmony,
they would experience a sense of constraint (e.g., "I cannot do
what I want to do") when they were blocked from 
attaining

positive both in the US and in Japan,

(452)

respectively.As predicted,it was significantly stronger in Japan than
in the US. This pattern supports the hypothesis that Japanese are,
in fact, more strongly motivated than Americans toward relational
harmony and, thus, toward independence in general.
It is curious that the strong relational motivation for Japanese
was especially evident for the measure of relational strain,suggest-
ing that it is the failure of avoiding relational strain that creates
the sense of constraint among Japanese. In contrast, the effect of
relational harmony was comparatively weak. This converges with
prior work that demonstrates a greater prevention (rather than
promotion) orientation for Asians than for European Americans
(Elliot et al., 2006). The finding is also consistent with the notion
that Japanese seek to self-improve by setting their standards high
andavoidingproblemsandshortcomingsrelativetosuchstandards
(Heine et al., 2001). The corresponding evidence for Americans
was much weaker.
Predictors of Wellbeing and Health
The second major hypothesis of the current work is related to the
first.BecauseAmericansarestronglymotivatedtowardindependence,
attaining independence is likely to be highly self-affirming for them,
Motivation toward personal control
The effect of personal control was negative in both cultures, with
personal control associated with a lesser degree of perceived con-
straint.As predicted,the culture Ã personal control interaction was
highly significant. See the right panel of Figure 1, which depicted
theexpectedamountof perceivedconstraintforthosewithpersonal
control scores that are either 1 SD above or 1 SD below the mean
within each culture (=0)1.The effect of personal control was highly
significant in the US,  = -0.37, t
(2898)
= 21.84, p < 0.0001, which
is substantially stronger than the one in Japan. In fact the corre-
sponding effect in Japan was only marginally significant, = -0.09,
t
(455)
= 1.83, p < 0.07. This pattern lends support to the hypothesis
thatAmericansarestronglymotivatedtowardpersonalcontroland,
thus,toward independence in general.The corresponding evidence
for Japanese was weak at best.
Motivation toward relational harmony and strain
The effects of relational harmony and relational strain on perceived
constraint are illustrated in the center panel and the left panel of
Figure 1, respectively. As expected, perceived constraint was nega-
tively associated with relational harmony whereas it was positively
Figure 1 | Effects of personal control, relational harmony, and relational strain on perceived constraint in Japan and the United States. Estimated means
for perceived constraints are plotted at 1 SD lower or higher than the mean level of each of the three independent variables within each culture.
1All three predictor variables (personal control, relational harmony, and relational
strain) had lower means in Japan than in the US. As a consequence, adjusted means
that control for the cultural differences in the mean levels in these variables become
highly misleading in that the perceived constraint of Japanese would look unreali-
stically low and the perceived constraint for Americans would look unrealistically
high. To avoid this misleading impression, the x-axis in Figure 1 is centered around
the mean of the pertinent predictor variable within each culture. In this way, the fi-
gure accurately represents both the culturally variable levels of perceived constraint
and the slope within each culture as a function of each of the three predictor varia-
bles. This caveat also applies to Figure 2.

Kitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing
went up. Importantly, however, these effects were moderated
by location especially for personal control and relational strain.
As can be seen in Table 3, both the interaction between culture
and relational strain and the interaction between culture and
personal control were all in the predicted directions and, often,
statistically significant.
Because the pattern of the data was highly similar across the four
measures of wellbeing and health, we created a single summary
index of wellbeing and health. We performed a principal compo-
nent analysis on the four measures of wellbeing and health,yielding
a single factor solution. In both cultures, a one-factor solution was
optimal.Thecorrespondingfactorscorewascomputedonthebasis
of another principal component analysis performed on the entire
sample and then submitted to another step-wise regression with
the same set of predictor variables.
The effect of personal control is illustrated in the left panel of

control and the wellbeing and health composite in both the US and

Kitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing
relational harmony (Kitayama and Markus, 2000; Markus and
Kitayama, 2010). We reasoned that such motivational orienta-
tions would manifest themselves most when they were blocked.
As predicted, Americans reported that they "could not do what
they wanted," thus, showing a sense of constraint in their lives
especially when they were low in personal control. In contrast,
Japanese reported that they "could not do what they wanted,"
thus showing feelings of constraint especially when they were
high in relational strain.
We then demonstrated culturally divergent effects of both

control and relational harmony/strain on wellbeing and health.
Specifically, control proved to be reliably more significant predic-
tor of the wellbeing and health composite among Americans than
among Japanese.This finding is consistent with several recent find-
ings that demonstrate the significance of self-esteem in predicting
wellbeing in individualistic cultures such as the US (Kwan et al.,
1997; Diener et al., 1999; Uchida et al., 2008). Together, these find-
ings lend strong support to the hypothesis that control and associ-

of independence that is particularly privileged and emphasized in
NorthAmerica.In contrast,in Japan it was the absence of relational
strainthatmostpowerfullypredictedthesummaryindexof wellbe-

Japanese cultural contexts responsiveness to others and attendant
social harmony are strongly valued and sanctioned.
In demonstrating cultural differences in the effects of both con-
trol and relational harmony/strain on perceived constraint,wellbe-
ing, and health we controlled for major personality variables (in
addition to age and gender), as well as educational attainment, in
both American and Japanese samples. We believe that this is an

Discussion
Cultural Variation in Pathways to Wellbeing and Health
Previous research, conducted mostly in North America, has shown
that both personal control and mastery strongly predict wellbeing
and health (e.g., Lachman and Weaver, 1998; Schneiderman et al.,
2001).Using age-diverse community samples from both the United
StatesandJapan,thepresentworkdemonstratedthatthisconclusion
is contingent on culture. Obviously, biology is important in health.
However,our work has begun to show that culture-specific psycho-
logicalvariablessuchaspersonalcontrolandrelationalharmonyor
strain have substantial impacts on various health outcomes.
We started with the hypothesis that whereas the independent
mode of being is constituted by an active motivational orien-
tation toward control and mastery, the interdependent mode
of being involves a strong motivational orientation toward
Figure 2 | Effects of personal control, relational harmony, and relational strain on the composite index of wellbeing and health in Japan and the United States.
Estimated means for the wellbeing composite are plotted at 1 SD lower or higher than the mean level of each of the three independent variables within each culture.
2It is important to note that the same conclusions were obtained when perceived con-
straint was entered and thus statistically controlled for in the regressions. This means
that the effects reported here were found above and beyond those attributable to the ex-
perience of constraint that arises when people fail to live up to the cultural mandates.

Kitayama et al. Independence, interdependence, health, and wellbeing
This subsidiary evidence suggests that it is misleading to con-
clude from our results that relational factors are unimportant
among Americans. To the contrary, they can be very important
in sustaining their sense of control, autonomy, and independ-
ence. Thus, the relational factors are likely to have significant
influences on health and wellbeing, but this influence is likely
to be mediated by affirmation of the independence of the self.
Here, there is a very different dynamic among Japanese. Our
results show that the relational factors (enhanced harmony and
reduced strain) can directly affirm the sense of interdependence
and, thus, improve health and wellbeing directly without any
mediation by independence-related factors such as control and
self-esteem (Uchida et al., 2008).
Facets of Independence and interdependence
Our decision to focus on personal control and relational harmony
to index independence and interdependence respectively was prag-
matic. The American data had been collected independent of and
prior to the current work. Necessarily we needed to do our best
within the confines of scales included in the original American
study. Quite fortunately, however, personal control and relational
harmony are likely to be two central elements of the respective
modes of being and, moreover, past work suggested that these are
two aspects that are likely related directly to some of mental and
physical health outcome variables (Diener et al., 1999; Kitayama
and Markus, 2000, for reviews).
Further, in their meta-analyses of scales measuring independ-
ence and interdependence, Oyserman et al. (2002) pointed out
that the existing scales of independence cover (1) valuing personal
independence, (2) personal achievement, (3) self-knowledge, (4)
uniqueness, (5) privacy, (6) clear communication, and (7) com-
petition to capture independence. Personal control, as assessed
herein, requires an attitude toward independence, a strong pro-
pensity toward achievement and competition, and clear self-
knowledge. It seems therefore to tap some of the facets covered
in the literature, although aspects such as privacy and clear com-
munication were not addressed. Likewise, Oyserman and col-
leagues observed that the existing scales of interdependence cover
several faces including (1) sense of duty to group, (2) relatedness
to others, (3) seeking others' advice, (4) harmony, (5) working
in groups, (6) sense of belonging to a group, (7) contextual self,
and (8) valuing hierarchy. Many of these facets are closely linked
to both relational harmony and relational strain, as assessed in
the present investigation.
Future work should examine whether the index of cultural
orientation suggested here would converge with other indicators
of independence and interdependence (Hofstede, 1980; Schwartz,
1992; Singelis, 1994; Triandis, 1995).
Universality and Culture-Specificity of Personal Control
The current data presents an interesting test case for discerning
cultural universals (Norenzayan and Heine,2005).From our factor
analysis (Table 1), it is clear that the control factor as constituted
by personal mastery and domain-specific control is common in
the two cultures. To the extent that control is experienced in terms
of these two relevant elements and these elements only, then con-
trol may be reasonably said to be cross-culturally common and,
important analytic step as it shows that the cultural differences we
found cannot be reduced to cultural variations in these individual
difference variables.
Extrapolatingfromthecurrent findings,onemightpropose that
any mismatch between prevailing cultural expectations or norms
and one's psychological propensities might compromise health and
wellbeing.This general hypothesis may help push the field forward
beyond the constructs of independence and interdependence. For
example, in a cultural group where honor is a significant virtue,
one may be especially unhappy and unsatisfied if his or her honor
is compromised.Further,such a person may be at risk for impaired
health, physical or mental. The same idea potentially applies to
other cultural norms, such as achievement ethics, egalitarianism,
religious purity, and political liberalism or conservatism. These
possibilities constitute rich future directions.
Are Relational Factors Really Unimportant in
Independent Culture?
The present data revealed that forAmericans the effects of relational
harmony or relational strain on wellbeing and health are relatively
small although they were still statistically significant. This observa-
tionmightseematoddswiththeemergingliterature,theoreticaland
empirical,suggestingthefundamentalsignificanceof socialrelations
inhealthandwellbeing.Forexample,multiplelarge-scaleepidemio-
logical studies have demonstrated a sizable longitudinal benefit of
availabilityof socialrelationsonavarietyof healthandwellbeingout-
come variables (House et al., 1988; Kawachi and Berkman, 2001).
We suspect that our findings showing relatively weak effects of
relational harmony or relational strain on wellbeing and health
among Americans are, in part, due to the fact that we looked at
these effects after controlling for personal control. As proposed
by Uchida et al. (2008), in independent cultural contexts, sup-
portive others may be crucially important to help maintain the
ever-important sense of personal control and efficacy, which, in
turn, likely enhances health and wellbeing. This implies that the
effects of relational harmony and strain on wellbeing are likely
mediated by personal control. Indeed, when personal control
was regressed on relational harmony and relational strain, the
pertinent regression coefficients for relational harmony were
highly significant for both Americans and Japanese,  = 0.33,

for Americans and Japanese, respectively. As expected, however,
the American coefficient was significantly greater in magnitude
than its Japanese counterpart,  = 0.060, t
(3354)
= 2.99, p < 0.005.
In the US, relational harmony had a highly reliable effect on the
wellbeing and health composite, = 0.17,t
(2860)

but once personal control was entered, the effect of relational har-
mony was significantly reduced to = 0.10,t
(2859)
= 7.00,p < 0.0001.
The mediation by personal control was highly significant, Sobel
test = 9.59, p < 0.0001. In Japan, the effect of relational harmony
on the wellbeing and health composite was reduced from  = 0.20,
t
(448)
= 4.96, p < 0.0001 to  = 0.17, t
(447)
= 4.45, p < 0.0001. The
same mediation appears much weaker although still statistically
significant, Sobel test = 2.26, p < 0.05. Relational strain showed
no such cross-cultural difference, showing a marginally negative
effect on personal control when the countries were combined,

examination in future work.
Future Directions
Future research should examine other related facets of both
independence and interdependence and refine our measure-
ment of these constructs. For example, pursuit of personal goals
and adjustment to others' needs and expectations might define
another significant facet of independence and interdependence,
respectively. Similar refinement and expansion are needed in the
measurement of health outcomes. In addition to a variety of self-
reported measures of health and somatic symptoms, it is impor-
tant to include behavioral assessments of health such as smoking,
drinking, and exercise.

perhaps, even universal. So the case can be made for a position
that control is a universal building block of self-regulation (e.g.,
Heckhausen and Schulz, 1995; Bandura, 1996).

if this were the case, it might not travel well to Japan. Accordingly,
one could argue that control is fully imbued with cultural meanings
(Weisz et al., 1984; Gould, 1999; Morling and Evered, 2006).
A general lesson to be learned from this discussion may be that
universality and culture-specificity are in fact two facets of the same
process. Because culturally specific aspects of any given process can
only be defined vis-Ã -vis its universal aspects, it is indispensable to
take the latter into account. At the same time, the culture-specific
aspectscantransformtheprocessitself innon-trivialways.Forexam-

Regional Variation in Japan: Hokkaido as
Japan's "Wild North"
Kitayama and colleagues have amassed some empirical evidence
for the hypothesis that the northern island of Hokkaido carries a
"spirit of independence"because of its recent history of voluntary
settlement (Kitayama et al., 2006a). To further test this notion, we
compared our Hokkaido sample with its Tokyo counterpart. We
observed that the effect of relational strain on the outcome vari-
ables tended to be smaller in Hokkaido than in Tokyo, as expected.
Indeed, in three of the four outcome variables (life satisfaction,
affect balance, and health) the regional difference was statistically
significant. Further, the effect of personal control on health and
wellbeingoutcomevariablestendedtobelargerinHokkaidothanin
Tokyo although the difference never reached statistical significance.
Therewasnoregionaldifferenceintheeffectof relationalharmony.
The present findings go beyond the earlier study and show that the
uniqueness of Hokkaido as a "frontier" region of Japan is evident
even with age-heterogeneous non-student adult samples.
The hypothesis that a history of frontier settlement encourages
independence would also suggest a degree of regional variation
in North America such that the independent pattern is more pro-
nounced among families that had settled in Western states and
