For biologic and behavioral reasons, cigarette smokers weigh less than nonsmokers. Thus, cigarette smoking
may modify the association between media use and obesity. The authors examined whether the association
between media use and overweight and obesity was modified by cigarette smoking by analyzing 8,467 adults
(20 years) from the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Odds ratios and 95% confi-
dence intervals of overweight and obesity were estimated by use of multinomial regression. To examine effect
modification, the authors created separate regression models for smokers and nonsmokers (pinteraction
¼ 0.002).
Nonsmokers using media 4 or more hours daily were 3.9 times more likely to be obese (95% confidence interval
(CI): 2.9, 5.2) and 1.6 times more likely to be overweight (95% CI: 1.3, 2.0) compared with those reporting less than
1 hour/day of media use. Among smokers, media use 4 or more hours daily was not significantly associated with
increased odds of obesity (odds ratio ¼ 1.3, 95% CI: 0.8, 2.2) or overweight (odds ratio ¼ 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.9).
Media use was associated with overweight and obesity and modified by cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoking
should be evaluated as an effect modifier in studies of media use and obesity.

Overweight and obesity affect almost two thirds (65.1
percent) of US adults (1). Although obesity has many com-
ponent causes, a combination of sedentary behaviors and
unhealthy diet contributes to the increase in obesity preva-
lence (2) occurring over the past 20 years (3). In addition to
the 25.4 percent of US adults who do no leisure-time phys-
ical activity (4), the sedentary behaviors of television viewing
and computer use (i.e., media use) are increasing. In 1998,
adults viewed an average of 1,551 hours of television per
year, 42.1 percent of US households had a computer, and
26.2 percent of US households had Internet access (5).
By 2003, 61.8 percent of US households had a computer,
54.6 percent of US households had Internet access, and hours
of television viewing in 2006 were projected to be 1,726 (6).
Generally, as media use increases, so does the prevalence of
overweight and obesity (7­12).
To examine the association between television viewing and
body mass index, researchers reporting in many studies have
analyzed smoking status as a potential confounding variable.
For example, cross-sectional studies have found that adults
watching the most hours of television daily have almost twice
the odds of obesity as those watching the least amount of
television, after adjustment for smoking, physical activity,
and other covariates (7, 10, 11). A longitudinal study, adjust-
ing for smoking, physical activity, and diet, found a 23 percent
increase in obesity with each 2-hour/day increase of television
viewing among women (12). Some studies using smoking as
a confounding variable have found little difference in the
results once smoking was included in the model (10­12). In
an evaluation of studies on the association between media use
and overweight or obesity, we did not find any studies that
examined cigarette smoking as an effect modifier.

The association between media use and overweight or
obesity, however, may be different for those who smoke
cigarettes as compared with those who do not. Cigarette
smokers weigh less than nonsmokers, because smoking in-
versely affects weight through biologic and behavioral
mechanisms (13­17). Nicotine's physiologic effects result
in appetite suppression, increased resting metabolic rates,
and reduced calorie storage (18­20). Smoking is related to
decreased meal size (18), and some smokers may use smok-
ing as a marker for meal termination (e.g., smoking rather
than consuming dessert) or simply substitute cigarettes for
meals altogether (20). Studies of weight gain and coronary
mortality (21) and of body mass index and mortality (22)
examined smoking status as an effect modifier and found
that these associations vary by smoking status.
We used the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine the association
between media use (television viewing and computer use
outside of work) and overweight or obesity among a repre-
sentative sample of US adults. The primary research ques-
tion was whether the association between level of media use
and overweight and obesity was modified by cigarette smok-
ing status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
NHANES is an ongoing national household interview
survey of a representative sample of the US population.
Survey data are released for public use in 2-year cycles.
The survey uses both household interview surveys and med-
ical examinations to assess the health and nutritional status
of the US population. NHANES is designed as a stratified,
multistage, probability sample, targeting the civilian, non-
institutionalized US population and oversampling persons
of low income, adolescents, those aged 60 or more years,
African Americans, and Mexican Americans. Data from
NHANES were combined for two cycles (1999­2000,
2001­2002) to increase sample size and analytical options.
Response rates to NHANES were 81.9 percent for the sur-
vey interview and 76.3 percent for the medical examination
in 1999­2000 and 83.9 percent and 79.6 percent, respec-
tively, in 2001­2002. Details about NHANES are provided
elsewhere (23).
A total of 10,291 adults aged 20 or more years partici-
pated in the 1999­2002 NHANES; of these, 1,824 were
excluded from analyses because they were pregnant (n ¼
559) or because of missing data on body mass index (n ¼
1,232), media use (n ¼ 12), cigarette smoking status (n ¼ 11),
or physical activity levels (n ¼ 10), leaving a study popu-
lation of 8,467 participants.
Body mass index
Height and weight were measured in the NHANES
Mobile Examination Center. Standing height was measured
with a fixed stadiometer, and body weight was measured on
a Toledo digital scale (24). Body mass index was calculated
as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Adults were categorized as hav-
ing normal weight (body mass index: <25), being over-
weight (body mass index: 25.0­29.9), or being obese
(body mass index: 30) (25).
Media use
Participants were asked about typical daily hours of me-
dia use by the question, ``Over the past 30 days, on a typical
day, how much time altogether did you spend on a typical
day sitting and watching television or videos or using a com-
puter outside of work?'' Response categories (hours) were
as follows: less than 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more hours, or none.
Media use was categorized for analysis as less than 1, 1, 2, 3,
or 4 or more hours.
Cigarette smoking
Respondents were asked, ``Have you smoked at least 100
cigarettes in your entire life?'' and ``Do you now smoke
cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?'' Respondents
who answered that they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes
and currently smoke cigarettes every day or some days were
classified as smokers. Respondents who answered that they
had not smoked at least 100 cigarettes or do not currently
smoke cigarettes were classified as nonsmokers. Former
smokers were defined as those who had smoked at least
100 cigarettes but do not currently smoke cigarettes. We
analyzed former smokers (n ¼ 2,253) and never smokers
(n ¼ 4,328) separately and found that the odds ratios for
overweight and obesity among daily media use categories
were not significantly different. Thus, we felt it appropriate
to combine never and former smokers for analysis.
Physical activity
Measurement of leisure-time physical activity was de-
rived from a series of eight questions inquiring about fre-
quency and duration of moderate- and vigorous-intensity
leisure-time physical activities. Participants were first
asked, ``Over the past 30 days, did you do any vigorous
activities for at least 10 minutes that caused heavy sweating
or large increases in breathing or heart rate?'' Respondents
who answered ``yes'' were handed a card with a list of 24
vigorous-intensity activities and an ``other'' category and
asked to report the frequency and duration of each listed
activity that they had done. For moderate-intensity activity,
participants were asked, ``Over the past 30 days, did you do
any moderate activities for at least 10 minutes that caused
only light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in heart
rate?'' Respondents who answered ``yes'' were handed
a card with a list of 32 moderate-intensity activities and
asked to report the frequency and duration of each listed
activity that they had done. Participants were categorized
as regularly active (vigorous-intensity activity for 3 days
and 60 minutes per week or moderate-intensity activity
for 5 days and 150 minutes per week), irregularly active
(10 minutes of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity
per week but less than regularly active), and inactive (<10
minutes of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity per
week) (26).

Energy intake
The total daily energy intake was estimated from
a 24-hour dietary interview inquiring about the foods and
beverages consumed during the 24 hours prior to the inter-
view (27). Total energy intake was expressed in kilocalories
and divided into quartiles for analysis. The energy intake
variable was also transformed as the log of total kilocalories/
day; analytical results (not shown) were equivalent to those
from the quartile analysis. Because NHANES dietary as-
sessments changed between 1999­2000 and 2001­2002
(nutrient values were revised, and the software used to cal-
culate intakes was upgraded), we analyzed the 2001­2002
data separately to determine if this change affected the study
results. Results were equivalent to those of the 1999­2002
analysis; therefore, we included both cycles of data in the
analysis.
Demographics
Demographic information was collected by a question-
naire administered during the household interview. The
variables analyzed were sex, age, race/ethnicity (White non-
Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Mexican American, other),
and education (less than high school, high school, more than
high school).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SUDAAN, version 9.0, soft-
ware (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center, Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina)
to account for the complex sample selection design and to
weight the sample to the US population. Multinomial
regression was used to calculate the odds ratios and 95 percent
confidence intervals of overweight and obesity compared
with normal weight by categories of media use. Physical
activity, age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and energy
intake were examined as potential covariates in the regres-
sion model. Effect modification by cigarette smoking was
evaluated by adding an interaction term (cigarette smoking
status 3 media use) to a statistical model of media use,
cigarette smoking, physical activity, age, gender, race/
ethnicity, education, and energy intake. Separate models
were then analyzed for smokers and nonsmokers to examine
smoking status as an effect modifier of the association
between media use and overweight or obesity.
RESULTS
Information on demographics, media use, physical activ-
ity, and body mass index by cigarette smoking status of the
study population is provided in table 1. Cigarette smokers
were more commonly men, were aged 20­34 years, had
a high school education or less than a high school education,
were inactive, had normal body weight, and were heavier
users of media daily. In contrast, nonsmokers were more
commonly women, had more than a high school education,
were regularly active, and were lighter users of media daily
than were smokers, and two thirds were overweight or
obese. Cigarette smokers and nonsmokers were significantly
different (p < 0.05) for all demographic characteristics ex-
cept race/ethnicity.
Obesity, media use, and physical activity differed be-
tween cigarette smokers and nonsmokers (table 2). The
prevalence of obesity increased and regular physical activity
decreased with more hours of daily media use in non-
smokers. Among nonsmokers, the prevalence of obesity
doubled when comparing media use of less than 1 hour daily
with media use of 4 or more hours daily. The prevalence of
regular physical activity also decreased with increasing
hours of daily media use in nonsmokers. In contrast, among

smokers, the prevalence of obesity did not vary by hours of
daily media use (p ¼ 0.17).
Table 3 shows the association between daily media use
and overweight or obesity, with adjustment for cigarette
smoking, physical activity, energy intake, and demograph-
ics. The odds of overweight and obesity are significantly
elevated with 2 or more hours of daily media use. Adding
an interaction term (cigarette smoking status 3 media use,
p ¼ 0.02) resulted in similar odds ratios for overweight and
even higher odds ratios for obesity with increasing hours of
daily media use.
Because effect modification by cigarette smoking was
evident, data for smokers and nonsmokers were analyzed
separately (table 4). Smokers with 4 or more hours of daily
media use had nonsignificantly elevated odds ratios for
overweight and obesity, after adjustment for demographics,
physical activity, and energy intake, compared with smokers
using less than 1 hour of media daily. Adjustment for the
average number of cigarettes smoked per day in the past
30 days also did not change the results (data not shown).
Among nonsmokers, media use of 2 or more hours/day
compared with less than 1 hour/day was significantly asso-
ciated with being overweight or obese (table 4). After ad-
justment for demographics, physical activity level, and
energy intake, nonsmokers using media 4 or more hours
daily were significantly more likely to be overweight and
almost 4 times more likely to be obese than were non-
smokers using media less than 1 hour daily. When former
smokers and never smokers were analyzed separately, the
odds ratios for overweight and obesity when comparing
those with 4 or more hours of media use daily with those
with less than 1 hour of media use daily were not signifi-
cantly different (overweight never smokers: odds ratio
(OR) ¼ 1.6, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 2.0;
overweight former smokers: OR ¼ 1.6, 95 percent CI: 1.1,
2.4; obese never smokers: OR ¼ 3.9, 95 percent CI: 2.8, 5.4;
obese former smokers: OR ¼ 3.6, 95 percent CI: 2.0, 6.5).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative sample, cigarette smok-
ing modified the association between hours of daily media
use and overweight and obesity. Cigarette smokers using
media 4 or more hours daily had nonsignificantly elevated
odds of overweight and obesity. In contrast, nonsmokers
who used media 4 or more hours a day outside of work were
more likely to be overweight and almost four times more
likely to be obese than were nonsmokers using media less
than 1 hour daily. Adjustment for potential covariates--
physical activity level, energy intake, demographics--did
not change the association between media use and over-
weight and obesity. This large discrepancy in the odds of
obesity between smokers and nonsmokers who have several
hours of daily media use points to smoking status as an effect
modifier of the association between media use and obesity.
Research has shown that people who watch more televi-
sion tend to consume more calories, have less healthy eating
patterns, and are heavier than those watching less television
(28, 29). Individuals may eat more while watching televi-
sion because of the advertising cues for food and beverage
products, some of which promote unhealthy products (30,
31). Physical activity is also lower among adults who watch
more television (10­12), perhaps because the hours spent
watching television displace time for participating in phys-
ical activity. Our analysis showed that the prevalence of
regular physical activity was lower for both smokers and
nonsmokers using media 4 or more hours daily than was
the prevalence of physical activity for their counterparts
using less than 1 hour of media daily. Although smokers
in this study were heavier users of media than were non-
smokers, the prevalence of obesity was lower among smok-
ers than among nonsmokers. This is consistent with studies
that found that smokers watch more television than non-
smokers (32) and, in general, that smokers weigh less than
nonsmokers (7, 14­17).
In this study, smokers did not have a significantly in-
creased odds of obesity, even those smokers who use media
4 or more hours daily. A lower risk of obesity among smok-
ers does not imply that smoking should be used as a weight
control practice, as a lower body weight does not counteract
the damaging effects of smoking (15). Of course, smoking
by itself confers many enormous and well-documented
health risks, such as increased risks for stroke, heart disease,
and lung and other cancers, and a decreased life span (33).

The odds ratios for the association between media use and
overweight and obesity were not attenuated when physical
activity and energy intake were added to the statistical mod-
els. The Nurses' Health Study also found that increased
television viewing is related to increased risk of obesity,
independent of physical activity and other confounders
(12), and other research of television use and obesity has
found that elevated risks of obesity remained after adjust-
ment for activity level (7­11). High levels of daily media
use may have such a strong effect on weight that moderate
levels of physical activity may not be enough to mitigate the
effect of hours of daily sedentary behavior.
It seems counterintuitive, nevertheless, that smokers who
are heavier users of media do not have higher body mass
indexes than do smokers who are lighter users, and these
physiologic and biologic explanations do not fully explain
this lack of an expected relation. Television viewers may
perform other activities while watching television (i.e.,
viewing is not always a passive activity) (34), but it is
unknown whether this is different between smokers and
nonsmokers. In addition, for some people, television is used
to provide background noise and companionship in a manner
similar to that of radio (34). One possible explanation for
our study results could be that heavier smokers may use
television or computers in different ways than do lighter
smokers or nonsmokers. Research is needed to confirm or
refute this or other hypotheses that can help to explain this
apparent paradox.
Findings from this analysis suggest that researchers as-
sessing the association between body mass index and media
should test for effect modification of cigarette smoking.
Merely adjusting for smoking in statistical models masks
the smoker/nonsmoker difference in the association between
media use and overweight and obesity. As this research
indicates, the association is different for smokers and non-
smokers. In this study, including both smokers and non-
smokers in the same model and adjusting for smoking
status as a covariate resulted in odds ratios for overweight
that were attenuated from the results of the model with non-
smokers but larger than the results from the model with
smokers. However, stratification of the data by smoking
status produced quite different results for smokers and
nonsmokers.
This study has several limitations. First, NHANES is
a cross-sectional study. Thus, the causal relation between
media use and overweight or obesity cannot be determined.
Second, the questions to ascertain media use and physical
activity have not been formally validated and may not ac-
curately identify the respondents' true behavior. If these
behaviors were not properly ascertained, this may have re-
sulted in the lack of attenuation in the models after control-
ling for physical activity and energy intake. Third, the
questions do not address whether people were doing other
activities, such as eating or doing housework, while they
were watching television. Identifying if and what people
eat while watching television or using the computer would
allow further assessment of dietary behaviors. Fourth, tele-
vision and computer use are combined in the same question.
However, the activities can be quite different. Because the
roles of advertisements and usage activities (i.e., sitting vs.
typing) are different for watching television and using the
computer, separating television and computer use would
allow analysis to indicate whether one or both of these ac-
tivities are associated with overweight and obesity. Fifth,
energy intake data from the 24-hour dietary recall may not
have captured diet on a ``typical'' day.
In conclusion, increased media use is positively associ-
ated with overweight and obesity among nonsmokers but
much less, if at all, among smokers. This association was
not diminished by adjustment for physical activity, demo-
graphic variables, or energy intake.
