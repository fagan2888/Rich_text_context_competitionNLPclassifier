Abstract
Objective: There is a significant evidence gap on the long-term educational benefits of longer
breastfeeding in low- and middle-income countries. We estimated the association between duration of
(any) breastfeeding and educational outcomes of Indian children.
Methods: We used regression analysis to examine the association between the length of breast-
feeding (in months) and future education outcomes on the basis of 2 data sets: (1) data from a follow-
up survey known as the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents Study (APCAPS, 2003-2005) of 1165
children aged 13 to 18 years from a controlled nutrition trial originally conducted in South India during
the period of 1987 to 1990; and (2) nationally representative data from the India Human Development
Survey (IHDS-2, 2011-2012) of 6121 children aged 6 to 12 years.
Results: In APCAPS, children with >36 months of breastfeeding scored 0.28 (95% confidence interval
[95% CI]: 0.00-0.56; P < .05) higher on tests than those with up to 12 months of breastfeeding. In the
nationally representative IHDS-2 data, above-median breastfeeding duration was associated with 0.1 year
(95% CI: 0.04-0.16; P < .01) higher educational attainment. In IHDS-2, >12 to 24 months and >24 months of
breastfeeding were associated with 0.12 (95% CI: 0.01-0.23; P < .05) and 0.19 years of (95% CI: 0.05-0.34;
P < .05) higher educational attainment, respectively, than for those with up to 6 months of breastfeeding.
In additional analyses by sex, we found that the benefits of breastfeeding accrued primarily to boys.
Conclusion: Breastfeeding duration was associated with small gains in educational outcomes for boys
but not for girls in India.

Introduction
Asizable literaturehasconfirmedthatbreastfeeding
improves infants' health and survival.1-3 The effect
is particularly strong when access to clean drinking
water is limited, and poverty pressures mothers to
dilute costly substitutes for breast milk.1-3 In line
with these findings, the World Health Organization
(WHO) recommends 6 months of exclusive breast-
feeding for newborns and continued breastfeeding
with appropriate complementary foods for 2 years
or more worldwide.1,4,5 Long-term effects of breast-
feeding, either exclusive or any, on the health of
mothers and their offspring are also increasingly
well studied.2,6-9
The nutrients in breast milk, such as docosahex-
aenoicacidandarachidonicacid,maysupportrapid
brain development in infants, thereby improving
cognition in the long term.7,10-12 A pooled analysis
of 9 studies, adjusted for both home stimulation and
maternal intelligence,7 found a 2.6 increase in IQ
points (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.3-4.0)
associated with any breastfeeding. The most com-
pelling evidence for a causal effect of breastfeeding
on cognition comes from a single cluster-
randomized trial of breastfeeding promotion in
Belarus, in which 6.5-year-old children whose
mothers originally received the intervention during
the period of 1996 to 1997 had 7.5 (95% CI: 0.8-
14.3), 2.9 (95% CI: À3.3-9.1), and 5.9 (95% CI:
À1.0-12.8) higher verbal, performance, and full-
scale IQ points, respectively.13
The effect of breastfeeding on cognitive perfor-
mance could be expected to extend to improve-
ments in academic outcomes--such as school
enrollment, grade attainment, and test scores--
through its effect on IQ or cognition. However, the
association between breastfeeding and education
has not been widely studied, especially in the con-
text of low- and middle-income countries.7 A few
small-scale studies from the United States, United
Kingdom, New Zealand, and Brazil showed posi-
tive links between any (not necessarily exclusive)
breastfeeding and educational attainment, but no
association was seen in Guatemala and South
Africa, and a negative association was found in the
Philippines.7,14-16
In this study, we evaluated the association
between breastfeeding duration and academic
outcomes in India. Rates of child undernutrition
in India are among the highest in the world. In
2014, 39% and 30% of Indian children under age
5 were stunted and underweight, with large dis-
parities across socioeconomic groups and
regions.17,18 Undernutrition in early life may
also worsen future educational outcomes.19,20
A staggering 42% of all school-going Indian
children drop out before completing grade 8,
and 64% of girls and 62% of socioeconomically
disadvantaged tribal children drop out before
grade 10.21-23
The potential long-term effects of breastfeed-
ing in India are poorly understood. Most studies
focus on the socioeconomic determinants of
breastfeeding rates and patterns in India.24-28 A
community-based randomized trial of promotion
of exclusive breastfeeding during the period of
1998 to 2002 in the state of Haryana found lower
diarrhea rates among exclusively breastfed chil-
dren but no associations with weight-for-height or
height-for-age Z scores.29 An observational study
also found no significant association between
breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeed-
ing with child growth metrics in national data.30
However, a cluster-randomized trial study from
Andhra Pradesh found that providing mothers
with information on WHO recommendations of
exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feed-
ing was associated with higher intakes of calorie,
protein, and micronutrients, and lower stunting
among children under the age of 2 years.31 To the
best of our knowledge, no study has examined the
association between breastfeeding duration and
the cognitive or educational outcomes of children
in India.
Methods
Analysis of Andhra Pradesh Children and
Parents Study
We used 2 data sources of breastfeeding and
future academic outcomes. One set of data came
from the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents
Study (APCAPS), a community-based trial of
nutritional supplementation integrated with other
public health programs and its follow-up surveys.
The trial was conducted during the period of 1987
Nandi et al 529
to 1990 under India's Integrated Child Develop-
ment Services (ICDS), which is a national pro-
gram of providing free supplemental nutrition,
preschool education, health checkups and refer-
ral, immunization, and nutrition and health edu-
cation to pregnant women and young children
below the age of 6 years.32-34
First, 2 adjacent subdistricts--one each as
intervention and control areas--near the city of
Hyderabad in the state of Andhra Pradesh (now in
Telangana) were selected for the study. Then,
within each subdistrict, a group of villages around
a village centrally located in the subdistrict was
included in the trial--resulting in 15 intervention
and 14 control villages. Under the ICDS, a
balanced protein­calorie supplement, made from
locally available corn­soya ingredients called
"upma," was offered daily over a period of 3 years
to pregnant women and children below 6 years of
age living in 15 intervention villages. The
intervention was delayed in 14 control villages
and introduced after the trial ended. Access to
other public health programs, such as primary
healthcare, child immunization, and anemia
control in pregnancy by providing iron and
folic acid tablets, were similar in intervention
and control villages. A short abstract describ-
ing the trial was published, but no other docu-
ments are available.35
Children born during the original trial period
(1987-1990) were resurveyed during the period of
2003 to 2005, followed by further surveys in 2009
to 2010 and 2010 to 2012. Data from these sur-
veys have been used to examine the association
between exposure to the nutritional supplement
and adolescent height, lean body mass, muscle
strength, cardiovascular health, and educational
outcomes.20,35-37 Information on the intake of the
supplement by participants during the original
trial is not available. As a result, exposure to the
supplement has been measured as intention to
treat, that is, birth in an intervention village dur-
ing the trial period, in these studies.
For the current study, we used data from the
2003 to 2005 follow-up survey of the APCAPS
cohort. Among the 8246 children born since the
beginning of the trial, 11.5% had died before the
follow-up survey. Of the surviving children, 2601
were born during the trial period and are therefore
eligible for follow-up. Among them, 654 inter-
vention and 511 control group children with his-
torical records participated in the survey (801 and
691 were invited to participate, respectively).35
We used retrospective data on breastfeeding col-
lected from their mothers by the 2003 to 2005
survey, when the children were 13 to 18 years
(see Table 1). Breastfeeding initiation was nearly
universal (99.4% of children), and the median
reported duration of any breastfeeding was 24
months (standard deviation [SD] ¼ 14.2). Infor-
mation on the exclusivity of breastfeeding was
not collected by the survey, which asked only for
the number of months before introducing solid
food (with no details on the type of food). Self-
reported data on whether currently enrolled in
school, highest schooling grade completed, and
scores on the most recent test at school for each
13- to 18-year-old study participant were
collected.38
We used Stata version 14 (StataCorp LLC) for
analysis and considered P < .05 statistically sig-
nificant. We used probit regression to estimate
the association between explanatory variables
and school enrollment and ordered probit regres-
sion for schooling grade and test score. The
schooling grade was on a scale of 0 to 12, and
test scores were measured as follows: distinction
¼ 5, first class ¼ 4, second class ¼ 3, third class
¼ 2, and fail ¼ 1.
The main explanatory variable of our regres-
sion model was months of any breastfeeding.
Since other foods, either as complementary to
or as a substitute for breast milk, may affect
breastfeeding duration, we also included months
before the introduction of solid food as a covari-
ate. Other covariates were household caste
(scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, other back-
ward class), religion (Hindu or other), household
standard of living--measured by the quintiles of a
composite wealth index20,39--indicators of edu-
cation of the father and mother (literate, com-
pleted primary, or completed secondary or
above, in comparison with illiterate), and child's
age, sex (whether female), and birth order.
Because preterm birth may adversely affect the
future educational outcomes of a child,40,41 we
included an indicator of premature birth among
our covariates.

There are large gaps in child human capital
investment and outcomes in India between boys
and girls. Boys are breastfed at a higher rate and
for a longer duration than girls.42 To capture the
sex-specific association between breastfeeding
and future outcomes, we included an interaction
between sex and breastfeeding duration in our
model. Finally, in order to capture any links
between the nutrition trial and breastfeeding
duration, we included an indicator of whether the
child was born in an intervention village among
the covariates. We clustered standard errors of all
regression models at the village level.
Analysis of IHDS
We further examined the link between breast-
feeding and educational outcomes in the nation-
ally representative India Human Development
Surveys (IHDS) of 2004 to 2005 and 2011 to

2012 (IHDS-2) data. India Human Development
Survey-2 covered 42 152 Indian households, of
which 83% were resurveys from IHDS. We used
IHDS breastfeeding information collected for the
2 youngest children born to each mother since
2000 (see Table 1). From IHDS-2, we used data
on the socioeconomic status of households and
the demographic characteristics and educational
attainment of individuals.
Because of attrition between IHDS and IHDS-
2, only a subsample of children could be matched
between the 2 survey rounds. Self-reported infor-
mation on educational attainment in years, based
on standard national schooling curriculum, was
available for all matched children (6 to 12 years
old in IHDS-2). For children aged 8 to 11 years in
IHDS-2, the survey administered standardized
tests in reading, writing, and mathematics. Chil-
dren were given a choice of the test language (1 of
13 languages). The reading test, involving a short
story, was scored on the following scale: can't
read ¼ 0, letter ¼ 1, word ¼ 2, paragraph ¼ 2,
and story ¼ 4. The writing test was scored as
follows: cannot write ¼ 0, writes with 2 or less
mistakes ¼ 1, and writes with no mistakes ¼ 2.
The mathematics test, involving calculations, was
scored as follows: cannot recognize number ¼ 0,
number ¼ 1, subtraction ¼ 2, and division ¼ 3.
These tests were very similar to those used in
other internationally recognized surveys of ado-
lescent children, including the Pratham Founda-
tion's Annual Status of Education Report surveys
and the Young Lives Surveys.43,44
Breastfeeding initiation was nearly universal
(99%) among children who could be matched
between the 2 rounds. The median reported dura-
tion of any breastfeeding was 17 months (SD ¼
9.5). Among matched children in the 8- to 11-
year-old age-group (ie, those with test scores), the
median reported duration of any breastfeeding
was 16 months (SD ¼ 9.3). Information on the
month of introducing liquids and solid food (but
not the type of liquid or solid) was collected by
the survey. However, information on child feed-
ing during the 24 hours preceding the survey--as
per the WHO standard for gathering data on
breastfeeding exclusivity--was not collected.
Summary statistics of the APCAPS and IHDS
samples are shown in Table 2.
Using the IHDS-2 data, we employed ordered
probit regression models to examine the associa-
tion between breastfeeding duration and later life
outcomes: (1) educational attainment in years and
(2) test scores (only for 8- to 11-year-old chil-
dren) in reading, writing, and mathematics. We
obtained the main explanatory variables--
months of breastfeeding and months before intro-
ducing liquids and solid food--from the IHDS
survey. Other covariates (from IHDS-2) included
age and sex of the child (whether female),
whether the child was underweight (as perceived
by the mother), interaction between sex of the
child and breastfeeding duration, household size,
and indicators of caste (scheduled caste, sched-
uled tribe, or other backward class) and religion
(Muslim or Christian, in comparison with Hindu).
We captured the standard of living of the house-
hold by quintiles of monthly per capita household
expenditure (in Indian rupees). We adjusted for
state indicators in all regression models and clus-
tered the standard errors at the state level.
Additional Analyses Using Categorized
Values of Breastfeeding Duration
Figure 1 shows the kernel density distributions of
duration of breastfeeding in APCAPS and IHDS
data, respectively. In both, reported breastfeeding
duration was significantly clustered around the
half-yearly or annual values (eg, 12, 18, and 24
months). The clustering was more pronounced in
the APCAPS data, possibly because of recall
error arising from the long gap between the
1987 and 1990 trial period, when the children
were breastfed, and 2003 to 2005, when breast-
feeding data were collected from their mothers.
The measurement error in breastfeeding dura-
tion could widen the CIs of the estimated rela-
tionship between breastfeeding duration and child
outcomes. We improved precision by replacing
the breastfeeding duration in months with cate-
gorized values in additional regression models. In
one set of models, we used a binary indicator of
above-median duration (as compared with at or
below median) instead of duration in months. In
another set of models, we categorized the breast-
feeding duration in APCAPS into the following
groups: (1) up to 12 months of breastfeeding, (2)
532 Food and Nutrition Bulletin 38(4)
more than 12 but less than 24 months of breast-
feeding, (3) more than 24 but less than 36
months of breastfeeding, and (4) over 36
months of breastfeeding. In IHDS, we categor-
ized breastfeeding duration into the following
groups: (1) up to 6 months of breastfeeding, (2)
more than 6 but less than 12 months of breast-
feeding, (3) more than 12 but less 24 months of
breastfeeding, and (4) over 24 months of
breastfeeding. We included indicators of each
category in the regression models (using the
lowest category as the comparison group)
instead of the duration in months. This
approach ignored a child's exact location,
which may be imprecise, on the breastfeeding
duration distribution.

We report the estimated association between
breastfeeding duration and educational outcomes
in the overall sample (ie, by excluding the inter-
action between duration and female child indica-
tor from regression) of APCAPS in the top half of
Table 3. We then included the interaction term in
the model and report its estimated coefficient in
the bottom half of Table 3. Full regression results
are available in Supplemental Tables 1-3.
We present the estimated regression coeffi-
cients of breastfeeding duration (excluding
interaction with the female child indicator from
covariates) from IHDS data in the top half of
Table 4. After including the interaction term in
the regression, we report its estimated coeffi-
cients in the bottom half of Table 4. Full
regression results are shown in Supplemental
Tables 4-6.
In order to explore the sex-specific differ-
ences more, we also estimated the regressions
with continuous and binary indicator of above-
median duration of breastfeeding separately for
boys and girls (results are reported in Supple-
mental Table 7-14). Because sample sizes were
low, we could not reliably estimate regressions
with finer categories of breastfeeding duration
separately by sex.
Results
Households in APCAPS were all from rural
areas; 96% of them were Hindu and 87%
belonged to socioeconomically disadvantaged
caste groups. Among children in the data, 79%
were enrolled in school and attained 8th grade at
school on average. Households in the IHDS data
were 73% from rural areas, 80% were Hindu, and
75% belonging to socioeconomically disadvan-
taged caste groups. Children in these households
had completed 4 years of education on average.
In APCAPS, we found no significant
association between the duration of breastfeed-
ing--either in months or as below and above
median--and educational outcomes in the overall
sample. When we categorized the values of
breastfeeding duration, >36 months of breast-
feeding was associated with 0.28 points (95%
CI: 0-0.56; P < .05) higher test scores as com-
pared with up to 12 months of breastfeeding.
Boys benefited more from breastfeeding in
APCAPS data, as breastfeeding duration among
girls was associated with 0.01 (95% CI: À0.02 to
0; P < .05) lower schooling grade and 0.02 points
(95% CI: À0.03 to 0; P < .01) lower test scores.

to 24 months of breastfeeding was associated
with 13 percentage points (95% CI: 5-21; P <
.01) higher school enrolment among girls than
boys, when compared with up to 12 months of

In IHDS, we found no significant association
between breastfeeding duration and educational
outcomes in the overall sample. However, the
above-median breastfeeding duration was associ-
ated with 0.1 (95% CI: 0.04-0.16; P < .01) higher
educational attainment in years. Similarly, >12 to
24 months and >24 months of breastfeeding were
associated with 0.12 (95% CI: 0.01-0.22; P < .05)
and 0.19 (95% CI: 0.05-0.34; P < .01) extra years
of educational attainment as compared with up to
6 months of breastfeeding. The durations of >6 to
12 months and >12 to 24 months of breastfeeding
were associated with 0.13 (95% CI: À0.24 to
À0.01; P < .05) and 0.11 (95% CI: À0.23 to
0.00; P < .05) points lower mathematics test
scores.
The interaction between breastfeeding dura-
tion and female indicator was not statistically
significant in IHDS except in 2 cases. Above-
median duration was associated with 0.15 points
(95% CI: À0.28 to À0.02; P < .05) lower writing
scores among girls as compared with boys. The
duration of >12 to 24 months of breastfeeding
was associated with 0.21 points (95% CI: 0.03-
0.39; P < .05) higher writing scores among girls
than boys, when compared with up to 6 months of
breastfeeding.
In the APCAPS data, months of breastfeeding
was associated with 0.01 points (95% CI: 0.01-

Discussion
We examined the association between the dura-
tion of breastfeeding of Indian children and their
future educational outcomes. We mitigated pos-
sible measurement errors by dividing breastfeed-
ing duration into 2 or 4 categories. In APCAPS
data, >36 months of breastfeeding was associated
positively with test scores. In IHDS-2 data, above
median, >12 to 24 months, and >24 months of
breastfeeding were associated with more years
of educational attainment. Breastfeeding dura-
tions of >6 to 12 months and >12 to 24 months
were also associated with very small (less than
one-seventh of an SD), and therefore negligible,
reductions in mathematics test scores in IHDS-2.
Boys received greater educational benefits
than girls in both data sets. When conducting
regressions separately by sex, above-median
duration of breastfeeding was associated with
higher test scores for boys in APCAPS. In
IHDS-2 data, above-median breastfeeding was
associated with more years of education but lower
writing scores for girls. However, the reduction in
writing score was equivalent to about one-
seventh of an SD and is therefore negligible.
Longer breastfeeding duration has been asso-
ciated with improved educational outcomes in a
few other countries. A study using long-term data
on approximately 1000 children born in 1977 in
New Zealand found that those breastfed for at
least 8 months postbirth were 62% more likely
to complete schooling and had standardized test
scores up to 0.59 SDs higher at age 18 than non-
breastfed children.45 A cohort study of 8226 nine-
year-old Irish children found that breastfeeding
was associated with 3.24 and 2.23 percentage
points higher reading and mathematics scores.46
A longitudinal study of 1739 men and women
born in 1946 in England, Wales, and Scotland
found that breastfeeding duration was positively
associated with educational attainment by age 26
and the ability to read 2 additional words on the
50-word National Adult Reading Test at age 53.47
Another study followed 2094 children born in
1982 in Pelotas, Brazil, for 18 years and found
that those breastfed for 9 or more months in child-
hood attained 0.5 to 0.8 more grades of schooling
than those breastfed for less than 1 month.48 A
follow-on study that revisited the cohort when the
participants were 30 years old reported that
breastfeeding for at least 12 months was associ-
ated with 0.9 more years of education relative to
those breastfed for less than 1 month.49
Our finding of a sex difference in educational
outcomes associated with breastfeeding is consis-
tent with the findings of previous studies of
breastfeeding patterns in India. A recent study
estimated that mothers on average breastfed
daughters for 0.9 fewer months than they did
sons.42 Another study showed not only that girls
were breastfed for 0.45 fewer months than boys
but also that the amounts of breast milk and other
milk consumed by them were 21% and 14%
lower, respectively.50 Health and educational
resources such as vaccinations and nutrition are
also provided more to boys.51-53 The sex differ-
ence in the intensity of breastfeeding may explain
the stronger positive association between breast-
feeding and educational outcomes among boys in
our data.
Possible explanations on the differences in
findings from the APCAPS and IHDS data sets
and also between our study and the previous lit-
erature include lengthy recall periods (in
APCAPS) and differences in the methods of col-
lecting breastfeeding data.
We first address recall periods. In the
APCAPS survey, historical data on breastfeed-
ing during early childhood of 13- to 18-year-old
children were collected from their mothers.
Similarly, IHDS 2004 to 2005 collected histori-
cal data on breastfeeding of children born since
the year 2000. As a result, reported breastfeed-
ing duration data were highly clustered around
certain values. The measurement error likely
attenuated our regression estimates, especially
in case of the APCAPS data, in which recall
periods are long.
Nandi et al 537
In additional analyses, we examined the asso-
ciation between breastfeeding duration and out-
comes separately for children who were between
6 and 9 years old in the IHDS-2 data. The recall
period for breastfeeding was shorter for these
younger children, yet the estimated links between
breastfeeding and outcomes from these regres-
sion models were not statistically significant.
As shown in Table 1, both APCAPS and IHDS
surveys deviated significantly from the WHO
guidelines for collecting breastfeeding data.
Although the questions related to whether chil-
dren were ever breastfed and total duration (in
months) of breastfeeding were the same, there
were significant differences in how data on exclu-
sive breastfeeding were collected. In particular,
neither APCAPS nor IHDS included detailed
questions on breastfeeding and liquids or food
given the day before the survey. As a result, the
nature and quantity of liquids and solid food
given to children are unknown. The duration of
exclusive breastfeeding in these data cannot be
reliably compared with international standards.
As discussed earlier, the background characteris-
tics of the APCAPS and IHDS samples were also
different. India Human Development Survey pre-
sents an average estimated relationship between
breastfeeding duration and education across the
country, which could be considerably different
from the local findings of APCAPS.
Although we incorporate in our analysis child
characteristics such as sex, birth order, and the
incidence of premature or underweight birth,
which could all affect the duration of breastfeed-
ing, there may be confounding effects from resi-
dual unobserved factors. Attrition between
consecutive rounds of data may be selective and
distort our findings. For example, IHDS-2 house-
holds that cannot be matched with IHDS data
have higher per capita monthly expenditures than
households that can be matched, and their chil-
dren are breastfed for 1.2 fewer months. Also, a
mother may selectively breastfeed certain chil-
dren more based on their or her own unobserved
characteristics. For example, Indian mothers with
higher levels of financial autonomy in the house-
hold or those who receive more prenatal care are
likely to breastfeed at a higher rate,54,55 whereas
Sri Lankan children who are born by cesarean
delivery are initiated to breastfeeding late.56
Information on maternal IQ, which might
affect children's cognition, was also unavail-
able in our data.
In addition, if mothers who breastfeed for lon-
ger durations also provide additional educational
resources to their children, any estimated positive
association between breastfeeding duration and
academic outcomes will be inflated. This may
affect a child's future healthcare and education
resources, such as availability of vaccinations,
school quality, and public versus private school-
ing, and could play a role in a child's decision to
withdraw from school--all of which could affect
educational outcomes. The socioeconomic and
educational environment surrounding a child also
may change over time, thereby affecting the rela-
tionship between breastfeeding in early life and
future academic outcomes. Because of a lack of
data, these unobserved factors are beyond the
scope of our analysis.
Finally, the underlying mechanisms through
which cognition or IQ may be related to educa-
tional achievements in India have been studied
inadequately. As a result, our findings are limited
in providing a theoretical understanding of the
relationship between breastfeeding and academic
outcomes.
Conclusion
Longer breastfeeding duration, in addition to hav-
ing well-established positive health benefits, has
been associated with improved longer-term cog-
nitive and educational outcomes in a few country
case studies. Using long-term data from a
regional trial and a nationally representative
household survey, we found small positive asso-
ciations between breastfeeding duration and a
few educational outcomes for adolescent males
but not females in India. However, household
surveys that collected data on breastfeeding in
India have not always followed the WHO guide-
lines. Although our findings suggest the potential
importance of breastfeeding promotion as a pol-
icy tool for improving future educational out-
comes, further research using higher-quality
breastfeeding duration data is necessary.
