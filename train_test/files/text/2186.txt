Abstract
Background: Perceived body appearance and body satisfaction are potentially related to weight problems and poor
health. The purpose of this study was to examine how gender, and ethnic differences in body satisfaction, perceived
body appearance and weight status change by age in a representative sample of U.S. adolescents 11­17 years old.
Methods: We used the US Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) 2001 survey which assessed perceived
body appearance, body satisfaction, self-reported body mass index (BMI) and socio-demographic indicators. The
associations between age and perceived appearance, age and body satisfaction, and between z-transformed BMI and
body satisfaction were analyzed using separate non-parametric regression models for both genders and the three
ethnic groups.
Results: Body satisfaction did not vary significantly by age except for an increase with age in the proportion of
Non-Hispanic White girls who perceived themselves as too fat. Although boys did not report being too fat unless
their BMI was above the age- and gender-specific median, one third of Non-Hispanic White girls felt too fat at or
below the age- and gender-specific median. Compared to other ethnicities, African-American students' perceived
appearance was significantly more positive and they were less likely to perceive themselves overweight at higher
BMI scores. However, during adolescence, the positive self-reported perceived appearance of African-American
boys dropped substantially while it remained relatively stable in African-American girls.
Conclusions: There were substantial differences in body satisfaction and perceived appearance across the three
largest ethnic groups of school-age children in the U.S. Stability across age indicates that these perceptions are
most likely established before the age of 10 and underline the importance of primary schools and parents in
prevention. Special attention should be directed to the dramatic loss of positive perceived appearance among
African-American boys.
Background
Concerns with body weight and physical appearance are
prevalent among adolescents [1,2] and are part of the
larger phenomenon of body image perceptions, which
relate to how individuals feel about their bodies [3]. Poor
body image is often correlated with increasing body
weight [4-6] and is linked to adverse outcomes such as
psychological problems (including depression and low
esteem) [4], perceived negative physical and mental health
[7,8] and a higher likelihood of poor dieting and eating
disorders, which may be sustained in adulthood [9].
Poor body image is also a potential mediator of the rela-
tionship between obesity and psychological distress [4].
While eating disorders generally tend to decline during
the transition to early adulthood, poor body image remains
a problem for a substantial segment of the adult popula-
tion [10].
There is a large body of evidence addressing the differ-
ences in weight, weight perceptions, satisfaction with weight
and their links with perceived appearance and attractiveness
across ethnic groups in multiethnic populations like those

in the USA (e.g. [11-19]) or the UK [20]. While most
studies reported cross-sectional differences for specific
age groups, some longitudinal studies were identified
that addressed changes over time within predefined
age ranges (e.g. [21-26]). However, the genesis of these
differences and their development across the age spectrum
remain insufficiently understood. Large variations in indi-
viduals' weight and weight perceptions occur throughout
the life course and are shaped by multiple factors. New-
borns of different ethnic backgrounds can differ in their
birthweight, based on genetic and phenotypical parental
differences [27,28]. Parental and children's own behaviors
join to influence weight and weight perceptions in early
childhood and kindergarten years. During the school years,
interactions with peers and comparisons with peers may
become the dominating reference system for children's
evaluations of their weight and their weight perceptions.
Children's media consumption also increases during this
period and can contribute to perceptions of weight, appear-
ance and attractiveness [29]. However, the age at which
perceptions become stable or change is understudied.
In this study, our goal was to examine ethnic, sex
and age differences in body satisfaction and percep-
tions of physical appearance versus body mass index
(BMI) among a nationally representative sample of U.S.
youth aged 11 to 17 years. The original study over-
sampled ethnic minorities, so we had a sufficient sample
size to examine these relationships among Non-Hispanic
Whites, African-American and Hispanic youth separately.
We hypothesized that a) while body satisfaction and per-
ceptions of physical appearance can be already established
before the bottom end of the here studied age range, there
will be substantial changes thereafter (conceptualized as
differences by age), b) females will display stronger age
effects, c) there will be particularly strong age effects
among Non-Hispanic Whites.
Methods
Sample
The 2001 Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC)
was a collaborative cross-sectional survey involving
36 countries in coordination with the World Health
Organization [30]. The main goals of the survey were
to assess the prevalence of health behaviors and to
gain insight into the influence of the social context
on young people's well-being. The present paper ana-
lyzed data from the HBSC anonymous survey of a
representative national sample of U.S. students in grades 6
through 10 during the 2001/2002 school year. Sampling
was stratified by grade, with public, private and parochial
schools selected to assure geographic representation and
random selection of classrooms within grades. The sam-
ple was designed to provide estimates of prevalence
within 3 percent at 95 percent confidence with sample
design effects approximately 1.4 times greater than
that of a simple random sample. An over-sampling of
African-American and Hispanic students was included
to provide better population estimates for these minor-
ities. Five hundred forty-eight schools were selected to
participate and 340 (62.5 percent) responded, yielding
18,593 eligible students. Parental consent and youth
assent were required for participation in the survey. Of
the eligible students (after eliminating 637 absent on
the day of the survey, 600 not providing consent when
required, 518 whose parents declined their child per-
mission, and 1,620 students declining to participate),
15,245 (82 percent) completed questionnaires. Of this
sample, 62 students who had missing data on a signifi-
cant number of key items and 365 students who were
outliers (< 1 percent ) for age in grade were dropped,
leaving a sample of 14,818. Only those students in
three ethnic groups (African-American, Non-Hispanic
Whites and Hispanics) and who had completed ques-
tions about body satisfaction and perception of body
appearance were included in the analysis resulting in
the final sample size of 13,267. The Institutional Review
Board at the Eunice Kenney Shriver National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development approved the
2001 survey. Surveys were administered in classrooms
by the class teacher. Questionnaires were completed an-
onymously and placed in a sealed envelope to ensure
confidentiality.
Variables
Perceived appearance
General body appearance was measured with a single
question: "Do you think you are . . .?" with a five-point
response scale: very good looking, quite good looking,
about average, not very good looking, not at all good look-
ing. A dichotomous variable was created with `very good
looking' versus the four remaining categories.
Body satisfaction
Body satisfaction was measured with the question: "Do
you think your body is. . .?" with a five-point response
scale: much too thin, a bit too thin, about the right size, a
bit too fat, much too fat. For the analysis, the variable
was dichotomized into too fat (a bit too fat and much
too fat) versus the three remaining categories.
Body mass index (BMI)
BMI was obtained from self-reported weight and height.
BMI was converted into age- (in months) and gender-
standardized z-transformed values using values derived
from the NHANES study [31]. Thus the unit of the new
variable (BMIZ) is one standard deviation of the BMI
distribution. Values within one standard deviation cor-
respond to 68% of the original distribution, while values

within 2 units correspond to 95%, and those within 3
units to 99.7% of the original distribution. The advantage
of this conversion is that values of the BMIZ variable can
be compared across age and gender.
Demographic characteristics
Students provided demographic information about race/
ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, Non-Hispanic Black, and Non-
Hispanic White) and date of birth. Age was calculated in
years from the date of birth and date of the completion of
the questionnaire and rounded to one decimal place. The
highest level of education of mother or father reported by
the child was used as an index of parent education. The
Family Affluence Scale (FAS) assessed the number of
family cars, vacations in the past year, home computers,
and whether the respondent had his or her own bed-
room. Studies indicate the scale has good content valid-
ity and external reliability [32]. Children also indicated
whether they lived in an "urban area (city)", "suburban
area (near a large city)" or "rural area (not near a large
city)."
Statistical analysis
Sample descriptive statistics (demographic characteris-
tics) were compared across ethnic groups using chi-
square tests. The association between age and perceived
appearance was analyzed using separate non-parametric
regression models for both genders and the three ethnic
groups. Age was treated as a continuous variable and
locally-weighted regression [33,34] was used to assess
the form of the association. Locally-weighted regression
uses data points in the immediate neighborhood to de-
rive the estimate of the given data point without making
assumptions about the general form of the association.
We used the gam library in R to apply this model. Non-
parametric regression models were also used to assess
the association between age and body satisfaction, and
between z-transformed BMI and body satisfaction. Sig-
nificance level was set at p < 0.05 for all analyses.
Results
Description of the sample
Gender and age distributions were similar across the
three ethnic groups, but the proportion of children from
high-affluent families was much higher in Non-Hispanic
Whites (Table 1). Parental education was highest in
Non-Hispanic Whites, followed by African-American and
(substantially lower) Hispanics. More than half of Non-
Hispanic White adolescents lived in suburban and rural
areas, while the majority of Hispanic and African-
American students lived in urban areas. As defined by
the 90th percentile of the national age- and gender-specific
weight standard, Non-Hispanic White boys and girls had
substantially less obesity than boys and girls in the other
two racial/ethnic groups (Table 2). Body appearance
was rated highest by African-American boys and girls
(Table 2). Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics rated
their appearance similarly, but substantially lower than
African-Americans. Again, the results were similar for
both genders. Conversely, Non-Hispanic Whites and
Hispanics indicated dissatisfaction with their body weight
(being "too fat") more often than African-Americans
(Table 2).
Differences in perceived appearance and body satisfaction
across age
The proportion of children who consider themselves very
good looking decreased with age in both genders and all
three ethnic groups with the exception of African-American
girls (Figure 1). The patterns of change across age did not
differ between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White youths,
but was significantly different in African-American youths.
There was also an important difference between African-
American girls and boys: while the proportion of African-
American girls considering themselves very good looking

fluctuated consistently at a higher level than the other
groups, African-American boys experienced a substantial
decrease from nearly 60% who considered themselves
good-looking at the age of 11 years to around 30% at the
age of 17. By the age of 17, after this dramatic fall in the
percent of African-American boys who considered them-
selves good looking, no differences were observed between
African-American boys and those from the two other
male ethnic groups. Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic
older adolescent girls displayed an overly pessimistic
self-perception.
In contrast to the perception of appearance, body satis-
faction did not differ over the age range studied except
for Non-Hispanic White girls (Figure 2). The proportion
of Non-Hispanic White girls considering themselves too
fat nearly doubled between 11 and 15 years of age, but
was stable from ages 15 to 17.
Reported BMI and body satisfaction
The proportion of boys who perceive themselves as
too fat started to increase gradually when the reported
BMI corresponded to the mean value of the sample (0 on
the z-transformed scale) (Figure 3 ). At one standard devi-
ation above the mean (which corresponds to a BMI greater
than the 84th percentile of the population) approximately
one third of the boys considered themselves too fat. This
increased to 70% or more at two standard deviations (a
BMI greater than approximately 98% of the population).
Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic boys did not differ in
the relationships between weight perceptions and BMI,
but African-American boys were less likely to consider
themselves too fat at the same BMI percentiles. This ten-
dency was even stronger among African-American girls;
however among girls there was also a difference between
Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics, with the former

starting to label themselves as too fat at lower BMI per-
centiles. The curves also shifted towards lower BMI values
for Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White girls in comparison
to boys, indicating more weight concerns among girls
than boys at the same age- and gender-adjusted BMI
percentiles.
The results were qualitatively similar regarding the com-
parison between ethnic groups for the `about the right size'
weight perception category (data not shown). The propor-
tion of children/adolescents who still considered their
weight about right when their reported BMI was above the
90th percentile was highest among African-American boys
and girls but also substantial among other groups. In com-
parison, at very low BMI values, large proportions of chil-
dren in all groups considered themselves about right.
Discussion
We analyzed a representative sample of U.S. school-
children with respect to body satisfaction and perceived
appearance. All three assessed ethnic groups displayed
distinct characteristics. For Non-Hispanic Whites and
Hispanics, perceptions of body appearance were similar
for both genders and across the age spectrum, but
African-American youths differed substantially from both
other groups. African-American youths had much better
perceived body appearance at the youngest age. Perceived
appearance remained high in African-American girls
over the age range, but dropped dramatically in African-
American boys. There was also a non-negligible drop in
positive perceived appearance among Non-Hispanic White
and Hispanic girls towards the end of the analyzed age

spectrum (older adolescence). Only Non-Hispanic White
girls exhibited an increase in the proportion considering
themselves too fat; the proportion doubled between 11
and 15 years of age. (In this age group BMI scores also
increased among Non-Hispanic White girls.) Conversely,
perceptions of weight remained stable for all other groups.
Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic boys had similar per-
ceptions of body weight in relation to their BMI, com-
pared to African-American boys, who were less likely to
perceive themselves as too fat at higher BMI percentiles.
Girls in all three ethnic groups considered themselves
as being too fat at substantially lower age- and gender-
specific percentiles of BMI than boys. However, there
was a substantial difference across all three ethnic groups,
with Non-Hispanic White girls substantially more likely to
perceive themselves too fat at a given BMI percentile, fol-
lowed by Hispanics and African-American.
The perceived positive appearance in African-American
boys was exceptionally high at young ages (60% considered
themselves being very good looking), but the dramatic
drop between 11 to 17 years of age is nevertheless troub-
ling. A longitudinal study in Finland found that percep-
tions regarding appearance are increasingly fixed with age
and more stable in boys than girls [35], thus underscoring
the importance of the unusual process occurring in
African-American boys. The drop in perceived positive
appearance in African-American boys may be associated
with increasing environmental awareness, which develops
during adolescence and may partially account for the de-
crease in self-perception [36]. McCabe and Ricciardelli
[37] report that, as boys get older, "they become more
aware of the sociocultural ideal for males, and they
recognize that there is pressure to strive not only for a lar-
ger body, but also for a body that demonstrates muscular
strength and tone" (p.676). This could be especially true
for African-American boys since research shows that they
are at greater risk for weight-related concerns and beha-
viors, as compared to Non-Hispanic Whites [38]. Paradox-
ically, the excessive weight-related concerns among this
group could stem from the disconnect between the larger
ideal body sizes that they strive for [39] and their percep-
tion that they are not big enough.
African-American girls showed high self-perception at
the age of 11, and sustained it across all of the ages stud-
ied. In contrast, there was a substantial loss of positive
self-perception among Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic
girls towards the end of the studied age spectrum. There is
evidence that the negative relationship between BMI and
perceived physical appearance is greater in Non-Hispanic
White girls ages 9 to 14, compared to African American
girls [6]. There is also research indicating that body sizes
presented in the media differ by ethnicity and thus media
can influence perceived appearance across ethnic groups
in different intensity [40]. Therefore, the observed effects
among girls could be either linked to the increase of BMI
or to the increased exposure to the media.
In all but Non-Hispanic White girls, proportions of
children perceiving themselves as too fat did not differ
by age in the studied range (11 to 17 years). In earlier
studies, pre-adolescents have been excluded from stud-
ies on body image because it was thought that these
issues mostly affect adolescents [41,42]. However, our
findings agree with more recent studies that challenge
this perspective and suggest that body image concerns
are increasingly affecting pre-adolescents [43]. The percent-
age of Non-Hispanic White girls who considered them-
selves much too fat or a bit too fat increased between 11
and 15 years of age, and then leveled off between 15 and 17
years. This differential effect may be the result of different
socio-cultural factors such as the media, peers, and parents

[44]. These results are consistent with findings that
African-American and Hispanic females respond differ-
ently to Non-Hispanic White media images than their
Non-Hispanic White counterparts, and possibly reject the
implicit beauty and social pressure to match this "thin"
ideal, which Non-Hispanic White girls internalize [45-47].
African-American and Hispanic girls may also perceive
that their peers and parents have less weight concerns and
larger ideal body sizes compared to their Non-Hispanic
White counterparts [39,48,49]. Although further research
is needed to explain the stabilization of body perception
from 15 to 17 years of age for Non-Hispanic White girls,
one possible explanation may be that social comparisons
and cultural expectations have already been internalized
by age 15 [36]. Our analysis also demonstrated that the
proportion of boys with a perception of being much too
fat or a bit too fat did not change with age, which corrobo-
rates previous studies that socio-cultural factors perpetu-
ate the muscular body ideal for males [50].
Early research on body satisfaction problems focused
mainly on girls [51]; recently more attention has been paid
to body image among boys [37,38,51]. Our findings indi-
cate that while concerns regarding overweight are more
frequent among girls, a substantial proportion of boys also
considered their weight as too high. In addition, our find-
ings indicate a higher proportion of boys considered them-
selves to be too thin. This may be another reflection of the
muscular ideal which is more evident in boys [50]. Similar
to women's internalization of the culturally ideal thin body,
men may be susceptible to internalizing a muscular ideal
from the media [52].
Although African-American girls had the highest age-
and gender-specific BMI compared to other ethnic groups
and African-American boys had substantially higher BMI
than Non-Hispanic White boys (and only slightly lower
than Hispanic boys), African-American boys and girls were
more tolerant than Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics
regarding the BMI z-score at which they considered them-
selves too fat. This finding is consistent with a large body of
literature indicating different ideals of body attractiveness
in African-Americans [19,38,39,53,54] and a lower aware-
ness of overweight among African-Americans [5,33,55].
The finding is double-edged: On the one hand, there is
substantial evidence that obesity increases multiple health
risks; greater weight concerns can support weight loss
behavior or the maintenance of a low body weight,
thereby subsequently reducing health risks associated
with obesity. On the other hand, weight concerns can
affect physical and psychological well-being or even mis-
direct weight-loss strategies [4,5,56]. These findings call
for balanced strategies to promote healthy weight per-
ception, with messages framed differently for each eth-
nic group. While addressing media pressure can be of
utmost importance for Non-Hispanic White girls [40],
nutritional and physical activity interventions can be more
important for other groups [15,57]. For Hispanic adoles-
cents the issue of acculturation was also raised, which add-
itionally complicates the relationship between body
perception and appearance [58,59] Addressing the links
between poor body image and eating disorders might re-
quire psychosocial interventions as suggested by the re-
search [11].
Limitations
This study is based on cross-sectional data, while its main
interest is in changes across age. However, it is unlikely
that there are cohort effects across such a narrow age
range. Despite previous research on the stability of body
image perceptions, we do not know how stable these per-
ceptions are within individuals over shorter time periods.
While one might think that body weight perceptions do
not change from day to day, perceived appearance could
be affected by concurrent social interactions. The mea-
sures related to perception were subjective per se, but BMI
could have been objectively measured. Instead we had to
rely on BMI calculated from self reported weight and
height. Previous research indicated the self-reported BMI
correlates well with measured BMI, in a way which can be
sufficient for studies of associations [60-63]. Nevertheless,
self-reported BMI may be systematically biased not only
for the population, but even more within specific sub-
groups, but is an adequate measure if no other possibilities
exist [64].
With the exception of the three groups studied, our
sample of other ethnic groups was too small for reliable
estimates of effects. Furthermore, information about BMI
was missing for a substantial fraction of students. While
missing information might simply reflect that the child
does not know his/her current weight, it could also indi-
cate that he/she is not as occupied with the issue of body
weight. Therefore, excluding children with missing self-
reported BMI might have resulted in a sample of children
more concerned with their weight.
When calculating standardized BMI values we used a
common standard for all three ethnic groups and did not
ask what respondents considered the reference for their
weight. This ignores the fact that the own ethnic group
can be the reference for body image and thus individual
perceptions of overweight can be based on ethnic-specific
standards.
While dichotomizing variables we had to accept some
loss of information, but at the same time applying ANOVA
would violate assumptions of normal data distribution. We
also contrasted the highest values with the remaining
values, in this way we focused on the upper end of the
spectrum of responses and did not report the findings for
those with negative body appearance.

Conclusions
There are substantial differences in perceived appearance
and body satisfaction across the three largest ethnic
groups of school-age children in the U.S.: While Non-
Hispanic Whites and Hispanics have similar perceptions
about body image, both groups differ from African-
Americans. For many adolescents perceived appearance
and body satisfaction are most likely established before
the age of 10, with little change during adolescence. Since
both perceptions are potentially related to weight pro-
blems and poor health, their early stability underlines the
importance of primary schools and parents in prevention.
Special attention should be targeted to the dramatic loss of
positive perceived appearance among African-American
boys in the analyzed age spectrum. It is also important
to note the rather negative self-perception among Non-
Hispanic White and Hispanic girls, especially towards
the upper end of the age spectrum.
