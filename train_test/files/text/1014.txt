Crediting Care or Marriage? Reforming Social
Security Family Benefits
Pamela Herd

Objectives. For more than 20 years policy advocates and policymakers have argued that Social Security should reward
women for raising children. Current family benefits, which only benefit women who marry, are thought to be outdated and
unable to protect the neediest women. Thus, would Black and poor women fare better if family benefits were linked to
parenthood, as opposed to marriage? I examined three care credit proposals that reflect the most common proposals put
forth in the United States and the most common designs in other countries.
Methods. I used the 1992 Health and Retirement Study and the Current Population Survey to create a policy
simulation that estimates how women reaching age 62 from 2020 to 2030 would be affected by care credits.
Results. Black and poor women fared best with benefits linked to parenthood. The specific proposal allowed parents,
from the 35 earnings years used to calculate their benefit, to substitute $15,000 for up to 9 earnings' years that fell below
this level.
Discussion. The poorest women fare better with family benefits linked to parenthood instead of marital status. Moreover,
they fare best when working women can benefit from care credits, but the care credit's value is not linked to earnings.
THOUGH often seen as a program that benefits workers,
40% of Social Security beneficiaries are the wives and
widows of workers. While Social Security's fiscal problems
and privatization have dominated the headlines, 25 years of
research has documented that family benefits, which mainly
benefit women who get married, stay married, and do no paid
work, are outdated (Advisory Council on Social Security, 1979;
Smeeding, Estes, & Glasse, 1999). Today, few families fit this
breadwinner model.
The subject of this research is one oft proposed, but little
studied, option to reform family benefits: increasing women's
worker benefits by rewarding them for raising children. Monies
spent on spousal benefits are diverted to subsidize the cost of
these ``care credits.'' Given that benefit adequacy is arguably
Social Security's most important goal, I paid close attention to
how rewarding parenting, as opposed to marrying, affects race
and class inequality among women. Policy researchers have
paid much attention to how an outdated benefit structure affects
women and little attention to how it impacts different groups of
women, despite the fact that poverty rates among Black and
unmarried women are three times that of White married elderly
women (Smeeding et al., 1999). Benefit adequacy is also
a critical theoretical issue; how policies shape gender, race, and
class stratification is the subject of considerable scholarly
debate (Esping-Anderson, 1999). And while scholars have
closely analyzed how the basis of entitlement for family
benefits, be it marriage or parenthood, affects gender inequality,
they have paid little attention to how it affects race and class
inequality among women.
Should Family Benefits Reward Marriage or
Parenthood? The Theoretical Debate
A key issue in welfare state research is how the welfare state
shapes gender, race, and class inequality (Esping-Andersen,
1999). And the impact of family benefits on inequality has
come under increasing scrutiny given the extent to which work
and family life has changed during the past 30 years (Esping-
Anderson; Orloff, 1993). One understudied question, however,
is whether the basis of entitlement for family retirement
benefits, be it marriage or parenthood, has differential impacts
on inequality.
Currently, the wives and widows of retired workers are
eligible for Social Security benefits. In fact, many industrialized
countries give benefits to the spouses and/or widows of workers
(Thomson & Carasso, 2002). Social Security entitlements
linked to marriage ensure that married women, many of whom
have worked little and for low earnings, have an adequate
retirement benefit. Though feminists are nearly universally
opposed to policies promoting marriage because they encour-
age women's economic dependence upon men, there is
a feminist rationale for marriage-based benefits. Simply,
married women contribute to men's earnings by taking care
of all the reproductive labor that is necessary to survive. They
cook, clean, and even organize their spouses' social lives.
Feminists have long argued the economic contributions to
households that women make in this regard (Secombe, 1974).
Indeed, married men out earn single men (Loh, 1986). Thus, the
state should recognize and reward these contributions. This
may explain why feminist organizations, from the National
Organization of Women to the Feminist Majority, have never
challenged the eligibility link in Social Security between
marital status and benefits.
Others argue that a better strategy for reducing gender
inequality is to link family benefits to parenthood. All indus-
trialized countries, except the United States, reward parenthood
through their pension systems (Thomson & Carasso, 2002).
Many argue that children, as opposed to marriage or labor force
discrimination, are the key to understanding gender differences

in earnings and ultimately income security in the 21st Century
(Crittenden, 2001; Waldfogel, 1997). Rewarding marriage
would not subsidize the costs of raising children for all mothers.
And the costs are high. Around 60% of women are not employed
when they have children under a year old (Bachu & O'Connell,
2000). Women face a high price in foregone wages (Burggraf,
1998). Contrastingly, men face either no wage penalty or even
an increase in their wages after having a child (Loh, 1986;
Lundberg & Rose, 2000). Thus, the state should insure against
the price of raising children by spreading the cost from
individual women to the larger society (Cancian & Oliker,
2000; Folbre, 1994; Knijn & Kremer, 1997; Lister, 1997). This
general call is the main justification for including care credits
in Social Security, which would reward women for raising chil-
dren by supplementing their worker benefit (Crittenden).
But while close attention has been paid to how family
benefits affect gender inequality, little attention has been paid
to how they affect race and class inequality among women.
However, as the discussion below will illustrate, linking
benefits to parental status, as opposed to marital status, may
have different ramifications on race and class inequality
among women.
Should Family Benefits Reward Marriage or
Parenthood? The Policy Debate
An oft repeated critique of Social Security family benefits
is that they are outdated because they best benefit women who
get married, stay married, and do no paid work. Individuals
receive contributory benefits as workers or noncontributory
family benefits as the spouses and survivors of workers. Con-
tributory worker benefits are based on an individual's highest
35 earnings years. Noncontributory family benefits have no
relationship to the recipient's work history. Around 98% of
noncontributory family benefit recipients are women (Harring-
ton Meyer, 1996). A wife's spousal benefit is worth half of her
husband's worker benefit, while the survivor receives 100% of
her late husband's original worker benefit. A divorced woman
can receive spousal and survivor benefits if she was married for
at least 10 years. Women eligible for both worker and spousal
benefits receive the higher of the two.
The problem, policy activists and scholars emphasize, is that
it is increasingly unlikely that women will get married, stay
married, and do no paid work. From 1970 to 2000, the per-
centage of women married dropped from 60% to 52%, while the
percentage of women divorced more than doubled, from 6% to
13%. In regards to work, between 1960 and 1997 the per-
centage of married mothers in the workforce rose from 28% to
71% (Castro, 1998). But women are not working enough or
earning enough to justify simply eliminating marital benefits.
Women's average annual earnings are around just 60% of men's.
Though most of the discussion about outdated family
benefits has focused on how this will impact women, an
outdated benefit design is particularly problematic for Black
and poor women. Black and poor women are twice as likely to
never marry as are White and wealthier women (Goldstein &
Kenney, 2001). Those who do not marry cannot qualify for
these benefits. Moreover, Black women have consistently been
more likely to work than have White women. In 1950, 43% of
Black women worked compared to 28% of White women
(Smith & Ward, 1985), though by the 1990s the gap had largely
closed (Council of Economic Advisors, 1998). Contributions
workers make through payroll taxes subsidize noncontribu-
tory family benefits. Thus, working Black women have been
subsidizing White women receiving spousal and widow
benefits. Moreover, for married women, the higher her spouse's
income the less likely she is to go back to work after having
a child (Barrow, 1999). Thus, the way the system is currently
designed, a single woman working in a low-wage job all
throughout her life will likely end up with a lower benefit than
a woman who has never been employed but is married to
a wealthy man (Harrington Meyer, 1996).
But others argue that Black and poor women have fared quite
well in the current system. The poverty rate among African
Americans would be twice as high if individuals had no Social
Security income (Porter, Larin, & Primus, 1999). Further, for
those in the bottom two fifths of the income distribution, Social
Security comprises 80% of their income compared to 18% for
those in the top fifth (Porter et al.). This income is critical to
their economic well-being. Thus, while there are problems with
marital status benefits for Black and poor women, would
they fare better with care credits? To answer this question, I
evaluated three different care credit proposals, which are out-
lined in the following section.
Care Credit Proposals
The care credit proposals reflect the varying designs
employed in other countries but also resemble specific
proposals that have been put forth in the United States. Austria,
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom all link retirement family
benefits to parenthood. Two factors determine the design of
care credits in these countries: eligibility (Should working
parents have their retirement benefits supplemented or should
only those who leave employment be compensated? For
example, France only credits mothers who have years of no
earnings, while Norway credits mothers with years of low
earnings.); and how the care credit is valued (Countries employ
two different approaches. One is to compensate women based
upon their lost earnings. A lawyer receives a higher credit than
a secretary. Alternately, the care work is valued independently.
The lawyer and the secretary receive the same compensation.).
Thus, I analyzed three care credit proposals that reward
parents for raising children. The proposals not only represent
approaches common in other countries, they also represent the
most common proposals in the United States put forth to date.
Their shared trait is the elimination of spousal benefits, which
require no employment history. Thus, they all require an
earnings' history for eligibility, unlike spousal benefits. Those
resources then offset the costs of care credits, which do require
an employment history. The differences between the proposals
center on who is eligible and how the credit is valued. Are
parents who work eligible? Is the care credit's value determined
independently or based on prior earnings?
Drop zeros. --Parents can drop up to 9 no earnings years (up
to 5 for one child and up to 9 for more than one child) from the
35 used to calculate their benefits (Advisory Council on Social
Security, 1979; Crittenden, 2001). Spousal benefits are elim-
inated. Only parents who fully exit paid labor can benefit.
REFORMING SOCIAL SECURITY FAMILY BENEFITS S25
The credit's value is based on earnings during years they
were employed.
Substitute. --Parents could substitute up to 9 years of
earnings (up to 5 for one child and up to 9 for more than one
child) with half of the median wage (Gore, 2000). This is the
median wage for those 15 years or older working full time,
which was about $15,000 in 2000. Thus, working parents can
receive the credit, but they must have relatively low earnings.
Obviously, the value of the care credit is independent of
earnings.
Drop Low earnings. --The Drop Low proposal, like the
Substitute proposal, will also benefit parents whether they do or
do not stay employed. But, unlike the Substitute proposal, it
puts no limits on how much they work. Parents can drop 5 (for
one child) to 9 (for those with more than one child) of their
lowest earnings years within the 35 used to calculate their
worker benefit (Crittenden, 2001). The value of the credit is
then linked to earnings.
None of these proposals require that care credits be
specifically tied to years where children are young. The
rationale behind this is that the burdens of childrearing vary
significantly between individuals. For many, time off is needed
when children are very young. For others, behavioral problems
in the teen years require more time at home for supervision.
Study Overview
I used the 1992 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the
2000 Current Population Survey (CPS) to create a policy
simulation that estimates how women reaching age 62 from
2020 to 2030 would be affected by the implementation of three
different care credit proposals, all of which entail the
elimination of spousal noncontributory benefits. I examined
how each proposal changes the overall distribution of non-
contributory family benefits or the benefits not based on the
individuals' earnings. For example, do women in low-asset
households, as a group, receive a greater proportion of family
noncontributory benefits under current rules or under the care
credit reforms? I focused further analyses on how women's
total individual Social Security benefits change. In particular,
which groups of women are most likely to get benefit increases
and decreases, and what are the sizes of those increases
and decreases?
Data
The HRS is a longitudinal study of individuals born be-
tween 1931 and 1941. The survey, which was started in
1992, is conducted every other year. It includes data on demo-
graphics, physical health, housing, family structure, current
and past employment, retirement plans, income, and insurance.
It is the most extensive data collection of a nationally
representative cohort of older people (Mitchell, Hammond, &
Rappaport, 2000).
The initial sample in Wave 1 of the HRS was 5,426. Of
these, 3,971 women consented to the use of their Social
Security records, which are essential to calculate Social
Security benefits. Another 544 married women were excluded
because their spouses' lacked earnings' records, leaving
a sample of 3,427 women. Weight was utilized to adjust
missing observations.
Any analysis of Social Security family benefits must be
based on couple data. Evaluations that do not use couple data
are inaccurate because individuals can draw auxiliary benefits
off of their spouse's or ex-spouse's earnings history. The HRS,
with attached Social Security earnings data, is the most
complete data currently available. Yet, there are two problems
in using the HRS to construct Social Security benefits: missing
information on husbands for formerly married women and
missing earnings years up to age 62 because individuals in the
sample are ages 51 to 61. The latter problem was more easily
solved. Waves 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the HRS filled in most of the
missing earnings years while the rest were imputed based on
the approach Mitchell and colleagues (2000) used to create
a predicted wealth file for the HRS.
The more difficult issue was missing earnings records for the
former spouses of current women beneficiaries who had been
divorced or widowed. To address this, I employed multiple
imputation (Rubin, 1987). I imputed earnings histories, for
583 women, from randomly selected male records with similar
characteristics to the women. Divorced women who had never
had a marriage that lasted at least 10 years and presently
widowed women receiving survivor benefits did not need
imputed earnings records. While error was introduced into this
analysis by imputations, there is no other data that provides
more complete information. The Social Security Administration
uses the same approach to conduct policy analyses. Multiple
imputation allowed for the adjustment of coefficients and
standard errors to reflect the introduced error.
The last stage of data preparation entailed a demographic
simulation to project what women born between 1960 and 1970
would look like at age 62. The purpose of this nonparametric
projection was to see how a younger cohort of women, with
different demographic characteristics, would be affected by the
proposals. The premise of the simulation was that the 1931Â­
1941 cohort in the HRS included women with employment and
family histories similar to the 1960Â­1970 cohort, it was just that
the proportion of different groups of women varied. For
example, there were divorced women in the HRS cohort, but
there were a greater number of divorced women in the 1960Â­
1970 cohort. Thus, I used the 2000 CPS to develop a series of
weights that adjust the HRS cohort of women to resemble the
1960Â­1970 cohort. Extensive family and work histories in the
HRS allowed for the reconstruction of these women's
characteristics between the ages of 30 and 40, which was the
age of the 1960Â­1970 cohort in the 2000 CPS. Although this
was a simplified projection, the results were similar to more
complicated and expensive simulations, such as the MINT
model created by the Brookings Institution, the Urban Institute,
and the Social Security Administration. For more informa-
tion on all of these data adjustments and imputations see
Herd (2002).
Variables
The dependent variable represented the effect of the policy
change from the present structure, which included spousal
benefits, to one of the proposed three care credit options
including dropping zero earnings years (Drop Zeros), substitut-
ing years with half of the median wage (Substitute), or dropping
HERD
S26
low earnings years (Drop Low). This dependent variable was
continuous, with both positive values (for ``gainers'') and
negative values (for ``losers''), but with a substantial number of
zeros (for those benefits left unchanged by the alternative
policies).
Table 1 provides the means and distributions for the
covariates. They included demographic, family status, socio-
economic, and work history variables. Year of birth and race
wee the two primary demographic variables. Race was a dummy
variable, with White women as the reference. The sample was
not large enough to allow for separate analyses of Black and
Hispanic women.
Socioeconomic variables included education, assets (liquid
and nonliquid), and benefit under the current Social Security
rules. The reference for education was women with a high
school degree compared to those without one and those with
a college degree or more. The asset and previous benefit
variables reflected women's economic resources. They were
divided into quartiles with the highest quartile as the reference.
The asset variable accounted for a spouse's influence on an
individual's socioeconomic and financial status. The benefit
under the current program structure identified whether benefits
were redistributed upwards or downwards.
Family status variables included whether women have
children or not; those with children were the reference. I kept
this as a simple dummy because I wanted to know how women
with children, versus those without children, fared. Additional
analyses that included dummies for the number of children did
not meaningfully alter the findings. Coded as a dummy, the
reference category for marital status was married women,
compared to divorced, widowed, and never married women.
The work history variables addressed how the number and
timing of zero earnings years affected who benefits under the
care credit proposals. One set of dummy variables represented
the number of zero earnings years out of 30 years of earnings
from age 20 to age 50: 0Â­5, 6Â­10, 11Â­15, 16Â­20, 21Â­25, and
26Â­30. In order to account for the timing of those zero earnings
years, another variable addressed whether zero earnings years
occurred in a woman's 20, 30s, or 40s. The reference category
was women who had zero earnings in all three decades (named
111). Other categories include women who had no zero
earnings years in any of those decades (000), zero earnings only
in their 20s (100), zero earnings in their 20s and 30s (110), zero
earnings only in their 30s (010), and zero earnings in their
30s and 40s (011). No women fell into the two other pos-
sible earnings configurations (101) and (001).
METHODS
The Three-Equation Model
While descriptive analyses will provide a significant level of
information, regression analyses will isolate the key correlates
associated with who would win and lose under of each of the
care credit reforms, as well as the extent to which benefits
would rise or fall for those whose benefits changed. The
baseline for comparison was the respondents' present benefit.
Under each proposal, each recipient's current benefit may be
decreased, left unchanged, or raised. The extent of any such
change can be measured in dollar terms. There will be a large
number of beneficiaries with no benefit change, thus creating
zeros. Therefore, I used an altered model from the two-part
model, the three-equation model, to investigate correlates of
benefit changes under each reform proposal (Manning, New-
house, Duan, & Leibowitz, 1987). The first part of the two-part
model captured the probability of having a benefit change.
The second part captured the size of that change.
The first equation (first part) in the model was an ordered
probit where covariates included demographic, socioeconomic,
family status, and work history individual characteristics. The
dependent variable was ordinal with categories corresponding
to a decrease in benefit (yÂ¼0), no change in benefit (yÂ¼1), and
an increase in benefit (y Â¼ 2). The second equation (second
part) was a linear regression of individuals' increases in benefits
given that they were in the increase category in the first
equation. The third equation (second part) was a linear
regression of individuals' decreases in benefits among those
experiencing a decrease. The dependent variable in the latter
two equations was the natural log of the benefit change.
RESULTS
Overall Change in Benefit Distribution
Table 2 overviews the policy proposals. All of the results
reflected outcomes for women reaching age 62 between
2020 and 2030. Figures 1 and 2 show what proportion of
noncontributory benefits will go to poor versus wealthy women
and Black versus White women under care credits as compared to
the current rules. The outcome measure was a fraction where the

denominator was the sum (in dollars) of noncontributory family
benefits overall, and the numerator was the sum (in dollars) of
noncontributory family benefits received by different groups of
women. Noncontributory benefits supplemented the individual's
worker benefit; they equaled the worker benefit subtracted from
the family benefit (be it care credits or spousal benefits).
Overall, Figures 1 and 2 show that each of the care credit
proposals helps reduce class and race inequality, as compared
to spousal benefits, in the distribution of noncontributory family
benefits. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the overall sum of
money spent on noncontributory spousal benefits, by household
asset level, under current rules. Women in the bottom asset
quartile received just 17% of these benefits. Current spousal
family benefits were preferential to women in wealthy house-
holds. How do the care credit proposals change the distribution
of family benefits? The percent of benefits women in the lowest
asset quartile received rose to 28% under Drop Zeros, 26%
under Substitute and 25% under Drop Low. Linking benefits to
care and employment was more beneficial for poor women than
benefits linked to marriage.
Figure 2 presents the distribution of noncontributory family
benefits by race. Black women comprised about 11% of the
sample. With current spousal benefits, they received just 7%
of the total sum of family benefits. All three proposals
significantly improved the racial inequality built into the
current system of family benefits. Drop Zeros, Substitute and
Drop Low raised the proportion of noncontributory family
benefits received by Black women to 10%, 11%, and 11%,
respectively. These proposals were more advantageous for
Black women because these benefits were more tightly linked
to employment than spousal benefits. Black women have
generally worked more than White women. Moreover, given

Black women's lesser likelihood to be married, part of the
advantage for Black women was de-linking family benefits
from marital status.
Benefit Changes: Benefit Increases
The rest of the results reflected a traditional policy analysis
where the outcome variable was the difference between
individuals' benefits under the current rules compared to what
their benefits would be under the proposed reform. Overall, the
most women benefited from Substitute and Drop Low, while
Black, poor, and unmarried women fared best under Substitute
followed by Drop Low.
Table 3 displays percentages of individuals receiving benefit
increases and decreases and the size of those increases and
decreases. While just 27% of women received benefit increases
under the Drop Zeros proposal, close to half of women received
benefit increases under the Substitute and Drop Low proposals.
This signals that most women in this cohort were work-
ing enough that only providing credits to women who entirely
left employment for periods of time was not as advantageous
to as many women as also providing credits to women who
had more extensive employment histories. Average benefit in-
creases were slightly more than 10% for all three proposals.
In terms of the distribution of benefit increases, Black,
unmarried, and poor women fared best under the Substitute,
Drop Low, and Drop Zeros proposals, respectively. Compared
to 44% of White women, 51% of Black women received benefit
increases under the Substitute proposal, compared to 47% and
55% under the Drop Low proposal and 27% and 30% under the
Drop Zeros proposal. The average size of Black women's
benefit increase was 15% for Substitute and 11% for Drop Low
and Drop Zeros. White women's average benefit increases were
10%, 12%, and l0% for Substitute, Drop Low, and Drop Zeros,
respectively. More Black women benefited from Substitute
and Drop Low because, in part, they had higher labor force
participation than did White women. But Black women had the
highest benefit increases from the Substitute proposal because it
was the only proposal that did not tie the value of the credit to
earnings. Black women had lower earnings than did White
women. Thus, for Black women, proposals that rewarded them
for childrearing even when they were employed were most
advantageous due to their significant employment histories. But
policies that linked the value of the credit to their earnings were
problematic because of their relatively low earnings compared
to White working women.
Unmarried women clearly fared better than married women
under all of these proposals but fared best under Substitute and
Drop Low. Almost double the percentages of divorced women
received increases under the Substitute and Drop Low pro-
posals compared to the Drop Zeros proposal. Among never
married women 16% and 20% received increases under the
Substitute and Drop Low, respectively, compared to 9% under
Drop Zeros. More than one half (for Substitute and Drop
Low) and one third (for Drop Zeros) of married women had
benefit increases.
The size of those benefit increases was highest under
Substitute compared to the other two proposals. Benefit
improvements for divorced women were similar, around 10%
for all three proposals. Never married women, however, had an
average benefit improvement of 28% for Substitute, compared
to 9% and 14% for Drop Low and Drop Zeros, respectively.
Unmarried women, perhaps because this group was comprised
disproportionately of Black women, fared best with policies
that rewarded their childrearing, even if they were employed,
Figure 2. Distribution of noncontributory benefits by race under current rules and care credit proposals.
REFORMING SOCIAL SECURITY FAMILY BENEFITS S29
and with policies that did not tie the value of the care credit
to earnings.
Women in the bottom household asset quartile also fared best
under the Substitute proposal. Compared to 43% of these
women under Drop Low and 25% of these women under Drop
Zeros, 46% received a benefit increase under Substitute.
Moreover, under both the Drop Low and Drop Zeros proposals,
higher percentages of women in the top asset households
received benefit increases than in the bottom asset households.
This was not the case with the Substitute proposal. Women in
the lowest asset households had the highest benefits increases
under Substitute at 17%, compared to 12% for Drop Low and
11% for Drop Zeros. Clearly, it was important for women in
low-asset households that the value of the credit be determined
independent from their earnings but also that they were not
penalized for combing employment with childrearing.
Benefit Changes: Benefit Decreases
These benefit changes also led to benefit cuts for some
women compared to their benefits under current rules. Overall,
for those who received benefit cuts, the Substitute proposal did
the least damage, followed by Drop Low, then Drop Zeroes.
Because the value of Substitute was not linked to earnings, even
those with meager earnings histories received a more generous
benefit than under the other proposals, which did connect the
value of the credit to earnings. Around one fifth of women
received benefit decreases relative to their original benefit under
these reforms. Black women, compared to White women, faced
the fewest cuts under all of the proposals but fared best under
Substitute. Just 12% of Black women had a benefit decrease of
about 29% under Substitute. Contrastingly, about 13% of Black
women received more than a 50% benefit reduction under Drop
Low and Drop Zeros. Between 22% and 26% of White women
had benefit decreases ranging between 30% for Substitute and
53% for Drop Low and Drop Zeros.
Both unmarried and married women fared better under
Substitute than the other two proposals. Because it was the
elimination of spousal benefits that led to benefit reductions,
cuts were concentrated among eligible married and divorced
women. Never married and widowed women did not receive
reductions. Divorced women clearly fared best under Substitute
where 14% received a 32% benefit reduction. Comparatively,
15% to 17% of divorced women received a 49% reduction
under Drop Low and Drop Zeros. The benefit cut for about one
third of married women was 30% under Substitute compared to
more than 50% for Drop Low and Drop Zeros.
Finally, women in low-asset households fared best, in terms
of benefit cuts, with Substitute as compared to Drop Low and
Drop Zeros, though benefit cuts were more concentrated in
high-asset households under all of the proposals. For 15% to
19% of women in low-asset households, the size of the
reduction was 30% for Substitute compared to more than 50%
for the other two proposals. This finding is of concern given
that this is an economically vulnerable group. Ideally, policy-
makers would include provisions that would offset benefit
decreases for this group with a policy change.
Benefit Changes: Replacement Rates
Given that the large majority of benefit cuts were
concentrated among married women, benefit replacement rates
in Table 4 give a clearer perspective on how these benefit
changes affect married couples. Replacement rates, which are
commonly used to examine the progressivity of any Social
Security reform, are the monthly benefit divided by monthly
average lifetime earnings or the percentage of average monthly
lifetime earnings the Social Security benefit is replacing.
Substitute, with a replacement rate of 81% for married couple
households with lifetime earnings in the bottom quartile, was
clearly the most progressive option. Under current rules, the
present replacement rate was 68% for this group. Drop Low and

Drop Zeros were ineffective. The replacement rate for married
couple households in the bottom quartile was 60%, which was
a reduction from 68% under current rules. Again, this result
reflects the fact that the value of the credit is not linked to
earnings, which is beneficial for low earning individuals.
Benefit Changes: Regression Analyses
While the previous descriptive analyses are critical to any
policy evaluation intended to understand how subgroups fare,
Tables 3 and 4 do not control for more than one background
factor at a time. Regression analyses clarify how very precise
groups of women fare (by controlling for multiple individual
characteristics) under each of the proposals.
The results from Table 5, 6, and 7 emphasize that those who
had lower benefits under current rules and those with fewer
years of zero earnings were most likely to benefit and the least
likely to lose from Substitute, Drop Low, and Drop Zeroes
respectively. These two variables were the strongest predictors
of benefit gainers and losers with the switch to care credits, and
the discussion that follows centers on these variables.
In terms of benefit progressiveness, Table 5 shows that only
under Substitute did those with higher benefits under current
rules have significantly lower probabilities, than those with
lower benefits, of receiving benefit increases. Asset variables
were not significantly predictive. Across all credit proposals,
those with college educations were more likely to receive
benefit increases than those with high school degrees, reflecting
the strong link between work, education, and care credits,
which had a greater link to lifetime earnings than did spousal
benefits. In terms of work history, women with fewer years of
zero earnings were more likely to benefit under all the
proposals. The one exception was under Drop Zeros. Those
with 6 to 15 years of zero earnings were more likely to benefit
than those with 0 to 5 years. This reflects the design of the
proposal, which only benefits women who have zero earnings.
The ordered probit estimates in Table 5 are not intuitively
interpretable, thus Table 6 presents predicted probabilities
based on the ordered probit estimates. Given that married
women were the ones most likely to lose under these proposals,
Table 6 focuses specifically on them.
Compared to the other two proposals, the Substitute proposal
best balanced benefiting mothers who remained employed

REFORMING SOCIAL SECURITY FAMILY BENEFITS S31
while not penalizing them too harshly if they left employment.
Under both Substitute and Drop Low married mothers few no
earnings years had an 85% probability of benefit gain and
around 5% probability of benefit loss. Under Drop Zero, they
had just a 26% probability of benefit gain and a 35% probability
of benefit loss. Those with many zero earnings had a 25%,
15%, and 7% probability of benefit gain under Substitute, Drop
Low, and Drop Zero, respectively. Their probabilities for
benefit cuts were around 70% for Drop Zero and Drop Low and
53% for Substitute.
Women with lower benefits under current rules, compared to
women with higher benefits, fared best under the Substitute
proposal compared to the Drop Zeros and Drop Low proposals.
Neither Drop Zero nor Drop Low had meaningful differences in
their impacts on benefit increases and decreases among women
with $500 versus $1,000 current rule benefits. Around one in five
married mothers would lose while around 41% and 60%, under
Drop Zero and Drop Low, respectively, would gain. Under
Substitute a married mother with a $500 benefit under current
rules would have an 84% probability of gain and a 6% probability
of loss. Those with a $1,000 current rule benefit would have
a 69% probability of gain and 14% probability of loss.
Finally, how did different groups of women fare in terms of
the size of their benefit increases and decreases, holding
constant demographic factors? Table 7 presents the OLS results
for those receiving benefit increases and benefit decreases. In
terms of progressiveness, previous benefit size was the factor
most strongly related to the size of benefit increases and
decreases. The Substitute proposal was the most progressive of
the three proposals: the higher an individual's original benefit,
the smaller the increase and the higher the decrease under the
reform. Contrastingly, under the Drop Low and Drop Zeros
proposals an individual with higher current benefits ended up
with a higher benefit increase. Household assets, contrastingly,
were not significantly predictive of the size of benefit change.
Table 7 also shows that among women with benefit increases
and among those who worked, those who worked the least
gained the most from the Drop Zeros proposal. Compared to
women with less than 6 zero earnings years in their
employment history, the benefit increase for a women with
16 to 20 zero earnings years was 122% higher under Drop
Zeros compared to 50% and 28% under Substitute and Drop
Low, respectively.
DISCUSSION
For more than 20 years policy advocates and policymakers
have argued for the implementation of care credits in Social
Security. The United States stands out as the only western
industrialized country that does not reward care within its state
pension system. The results from this study clarify how
implementing care credits would change the distribution of
benefits among women beneficiaries reaching age 62 between
2020 and 2030.
Policy researchers and welfare state theorists have failed to
consider how the basis of entitlement for family benefits, be it
marriage or parenthood, affects race and class inequality among
women. The results from this study show that linking family
benefits to parenthood, as opposed to marriage, is most
advantageous for poor and Black women. These women fared
better both because they were less likely to be married but also
more likely to have been employed. Care credits supplement
the worker benefit, while spousal benefits have no link to
women's earnings. Inequality among women is lessened when
their benefits are based on their own work, be it in the work-
place or raising children, as opposed to their spouses' work.
In terms of the practical policy implications, while all the
proposals are more progressive than spousal benefits, the
Substitute proposal is clearly the most progressive. Black and
poor women fare best with the Substitute and Drop Low
proposals, respectively. Both proposals allow mothers to
benefit from combining their childrearing with employment,
but the Substitute proposal values the care credit independently
of women's earnings, while the Drop Low proposal values the
care credit based on beneficiaries' earnings. The Drop Zeros
proposal, though the most often proposed plan, benefits half as
many women as do the Substitute and Drop Low proposals.
Requiring full exits from employment to receive the credit,
while simultaneously valuing that credit based on years where
there are earnings, is a problematic mix for most women. While
Drop Zero and Drop Low are marginally more progressive than
spousal benefits, they are highly questionable solutions to the
problem given their drawbacks.
One large negative outcome to these proposals, however, is
the following: Resources are redistributed without increasing
that pool of resources; thus, some are worse off under the new
rules. The Substitute proposal, in particular, evens the playing
field among mothers. The old rules favored married (and
formerly married) mothers who were rarely employed (often
White and wealthier women) at the expense of single mothers
who worked (often poor and Black women). Nonetheless, while
45% of women would fare better under the new rules (the
Substitute proposal) as compared to the old, 30% would fare
worse. But declaring those changes should not be made because
some will end up worse off than before condemns the state to
perpetually reinforcing existing inequality.
