Abstract
BACKGROUND
Most research on the imprisonment-mortality relationship has focused exclusively on
non-Hispanic black males and non-Hispanic white males at the national level in the
United States.
OBJECTIVE
To document variation in this relationship across states by race/ethnicity and sex.
METHODS
We estimate the crude and age-specific mortality rates of state prisoners and of the
general population in 7-9 states. We also present the resulting standardized mortality
ratios (SMRs).
RESULTS
The results provide support for four key conclusions. First, although there is substantial
cross-state variability in the mortality rates of male and female state prisoners, there is
far more cross-state variability in the mortality rates of males and females in the general
population. Second, the mortality advantage of male prisoners over males in the general
population was larger than the mortality advantage of female prisoners over females in
the general population. Third, relative to same-race and same-sex peers in the general
population, black males experienced the largest mortality advantage across all of the

states considered, and this advantage was often quite substantial. Finally, Hispanic
female state prisoners in New York were the one group at a significant mortality
disadvantage relative to the general population, although because of the small number
of Hispanic female state prisoners who died over this period (20), further research
testing the robustness of this finding to different time periods and places is sorely
needed.
CONCLUSION
Although mortality disparities among prisoners are smaller than those found in the
general population, research should consider how conditions of confinement affect the
mortality of prisoners.
1. Introduction
As the US imprisonment rate has increased, scholars have realized that the penal system
has an impact upon the health and wellbeing of the men and women who come into
contact with it (Drucker 2014; Fazel and Baillargeon 2011; Massoglia 2008; Schnittker
and John 2007; Wang et al. 2014; Wildeman and Muller 2012). This insight was driven
in part by how imprisonment shapes mortality. While imprisoned males, especially non-
Hispanic black imprisoned males, die at significantly lower rates than males in the
general population, former prisoners die at very high rates (Binswanger et al. 2007;
Mumola 2007; Noonan 2013; Patterson 2010; Spaulding et al. 2011; Rosen,
Schoenbach, and Wohl 2008; Rosen, Wohl, and Schoenbach 2011).
Research on the imprisonment-mortality relationship has to date focused primarily
on national estimates of this relationship for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic
black males, with minimal attention paid to how the imprisonment-mortality
relationship varies across states (but see Noonan 2013; Rosen, Wohl, and Schoenbach
2011; Spaulding et al. 2011) and whether the lower-than-expected mortality rates of
non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black inmates can also be found among female
inmates and Hispanic inmates. These omissions are unfortunate because the research
considering such variation implies substantial variations across states, racial/ethnic
groups, and sexes (Mumola 2007; Noonan 2013). In this article, we fill this gap by
considering the imprisonment-mortality relationship across seven to nine states for non-
Hispanic white (hereafter "white"), non-Hispanic black (hereafter "black"), and
Hispanic males and females.

2. Data and method
2.1 Data
We used data from the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program, the National Prisoner
Statistics, and the National Corrections Reporting Program (Bureau of Justice Statistics
2014a, 2014b, 2014c) to estimate the crude and age-specific mortality rates of 18-54
year old (a) male state prisoners in nine states (California, Georgia, Mississippi,
Missouri, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington) and (b)
female state prisoners in seven states (excluding Utah and Washington). All analyses
collapsed 10 years of data (2001-2010). We selected these states because they reported
annually to the National Corrections Reporting Program, had low levels of missing data
on race/ethnicity, and had at least 10 deaths among state prisoners over the period. We
focus on individuals in the 18-54 age range to consider how imprisonment shapes the
risk of premature mortality, but future analyses should also consider mortality at older
ages.
Since 2001, the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (hereafter "DCRP") has
collected information on the age, sex, and race/ethnicity for each individual who died in
a state prison. All 50 state departments of corrections have participated since 2001, thus
providing a total custodial death count of all state prisoners. The DCRP data provide a
more precise count of the number of deaths than the National Prisoner Statistics data
(hereafter NPS) for two reasons. First, since the DCRP data are based on individual
records whereas the NPS data are limited to aggregate counts, there is no risk of double-
counting in the DCRP. Second, the DCRP includes information on all inmates who die
while in the custody of a prison, while the NPS data include only sentenced inmates,
representing 97% of state prisoners (Carson 2015).
Data from the NPS and the National Corrections Reporting Program (hereafter
NCRP) provide the denominator for our in-prison mortality estimates. By averaging
year-end custody counts from the NCRP and the NPS, we can generate estimates of the
total mid-year population of prisoners in each state, as well as the race/ethnicity, sex,
and age distribution of the penal population. We rely on the mid-year population count
of state prisoners rather than yearend counts because this provides the closest
approximation of person-years lived during the year.
To generate age-specific estimates of the correctional population by race/ethnicity,
we apply the NCRP age distribution to the NPS jurisdiction control totals, which does
not collect information on the age distribution of prisoners. When race/ethnicity is
missing in the NCRP data, we impute it assuming the data are missing completely at
random. This should negligibly affect our estimates because of the very low levels of
missing data on race/ethnicity in the NCRP states we use.
Wildeman et al.: State-level variation in the imprisonment-mortality relationship, 2001-2010
362 http://www.demographic-research.org
We use data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate
mortality rates in the general population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
2014a, 2014b).
2.2 Analytic strategy
The analysis proceeds in three stages. In the first, we calculate crude mortality rates for
all males and females aged 18-54 in state prisons and in the general population in each
state we consider in this analysis, as well as for males and females identified as black,
white, and Hispanic. In the second, we use direct standardization (Preston, Heuveline,
and Guillot 2001) to estimate what the mortality rate of male and female state prisoners
aged 18-54 and males and females aged 18-54 in the general population would be if
we used the average age distribution of the population (including males and females) of
these states as the referent. In the final stage, we estimate standardized mortality ratios
(SMRs) for state prisoners relative to the general population.
Although the individual-level data on inmates used for all analyses are confidential
and therefore we cannot release the individual-level data we used, all state-level data
and files used to produce the results presented here are available online through
Demographic Research.
3. Results
3.1 The imprisonment-mortality relationship for males
Results from Table 1 show that the crude mortality rate for male prisoners in all of the
nine states is significantly lower than it is for males in the general population. Age-
adjusted mortality rates for male prisoners are also lower in each state than they are for
males in the general population. These results also show, however, that there is far more
cross-state variation in the adjusted mortality rates of the general population (from 215
per 100,000 to 426 per 100,000) than there is in the adjusted mortality rates of state
prisoners (from 99 per 100,000 to 154 per 100,000).

18-54 in state prison and in the general population by race/ethnicity

The mortality advantage of black male prisoners over black males in the general
population is larger than the mortality advantage for white and Hispanic male inmates.
Black male prisoner's adjusted mortality rates are also lower in each state, although not
significantly so in all states, than are the adjusted mortality rates of white and Hispanic
males in the general population.
Table 2 shows SMRs for male prisoners relative to males in the population for the
total population. Although there is variation in SMRs across states, the amount of
variation is small, with the state with the highest SMR (New York) coming in at 0.77,
and the state with the lowest SMR (Mississippi) coming in at 0.48, suggesting a
mortality advantage across all states. Because cross-state differences in mortality are
more substantial in the general population than in the inmate population, however,
cross-state variation in the SMRs of prisoners may provide more insight regarding the
mortality of the general population than that of the inmate population.

SMRs were lowest for black male prisoners, ranging from 0.16 in Washington to
0.46 in New York state, and there was relatively little cross-state variability in SMRs
for this group. Interestingly, even the highest SMR for black males was lower than the
lowest SMR for white males (0.50) and for Hispanic males (0.65). Hispanic male
prisoners were also at a significant mortality advantage relative to Hispanic males in the
population for both states we consider, and white male prisoners were at a significant
mortality advantage in every state except South Carolina, where they had an SMR of
Demographic Research: Volume 34, Article 12

0.93 [95% CI: 0.73, 1.08]. State-level variation in SMRs was greatest for white males,
with a low of 0.50 in Utah and a high of 0.93 in South Carolina.
3.2 The imprisonment-mortality relationship for females
Results from Table 3 show that the crude mortality rate for female prisoners is
significantly lower in six of the seven states considered, with only female prisoners in
New York having higher, albeit not significantly so, crude mortality rates than females
in the general population.
Adjusted mortality rates were also higher for females in the population in six
states, although the difference was only significant in three states (California, Georgia,
and Missouri) because age-standardizing the mortality rates reduced the mortality gap
in the other three states in which female prisoners had a mortality advantage in the
crude mortality rate (Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina). Female
prisoners in New York died at a higher rate than females in the general population, but
this difference was not significant at the .05 level.
Consistent with the results from Table 1, there is more cross-state variation in the
crude and adjusted mortality rates of females in the general population than females in
state prisons.
Table 3 also indicates marked racial/ethnic variation in the imprisonment-mortality
relationship. The crude mortality rate for white female prisoners was significantly lower
than that of females in the population in five states. After adjusting for differences in
the age distribution, white female prisoners died at a significantly lower rate than
females in the population in only three states. Black female prisoners, on the other
hand, died at a lower rate than black females in the general population in every state,
but some of these differences, while substantial, were not statistically significant.
Interestingly, Hispanic female prisoners in New York died at a higher rate than
Hispanic females in the population, and the mortality disadvantage of Hispanic female
prisoners remained after adjusting for differences in age distribution. However, this
finding should be treated with some caution, because only 20 Hispanic female state
prisoners died in New York between 2001 and 2010. We discuss this finding further in
the discussion section of this article.

The mortality disadvantage of Hispanic female prisoners in New York is made
more transparent in Table 4, which shows standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for
female prisoners relative to females in the general population. Hispanic female
prisoners in New York were the one group at a significant mortality disadvantage
relative to females in the general population in the same state [SMR = 3.32; 95% CI:
1.82 to 4.88], and this advantage was quite substantial.
4. Discussion
The results from our analysis provide support for four conclusions. First, although there
is some cross-state variation in the crude and adjusted mortality rates of male and
female prisoners, there is far more variation in the crude and adjusted mortality rates of
males and females in the general population. This suggests that cross-state differences
in SMRs partially reflect differences in inmate mortality but mostly reflect underlying
differences in mortality in the general population.
Second, the "mortality advantage" of female inmates was smaller than for male
inmates, with female inmates often dying at roughly the same rate as females in the
population. In order to better understand why this might be the case, it is worth
considering the mechanisms leading to the lower mortality of prisoners. Much of this
relationship is due to the better - and constitutionally mandated - healthcare inmates
receive relative to similar individuals in the general population (e.g., Patterson 2010), as
well as the lower risks of death due to accidents, homicide, and overdose they face
Wildeman et al.: State-level variation in the imprisonment-mortality relationship, 2001-2010
368 http://www.demographic-research.org
while incarcerated (e.g., Spaulding et al. 2011). Some have also speculated that inmates
may have just been in better health than individuals in the general population prior to
being incarcerated, but new evidence suggests that is highly unlikely to be the case
(Bacak and Wildeman 2015). In light of existing research on the topic, the lower SMRs
for female inmates than male inmates could be partially explained by the fact that
female inmates were in worse health upon prison entry relative to their peers in the
population than male inmates were. Two-thirds of female prisoners reported a chronic
medical condition whereas about one-half of male prisoners did; female inmates also
suffer disproportionately from ailments ranging from arthritis and asthma to
hypertension, kidney problems, and hepatitis (Maruschak 2008; Maruschak, Berzofsky,
and Unangst 2015). Another possibility is that because females in the general
population die at far lower rates of the causes of mortality that prisons most diminish
(homicide, accidents, and overdose) than do males in the general population, female
prisoners might simply have less to gain in terms of mortality reductions than do male
prisoners, especially in the 18-54 age range that we considered here.
Third, there was significantly less cross-state variation in the imprisonment-
mortality association for blacks, with especially minimal variation across states in this
relationship for black males. Black male inmates also had the lowest SMRs of all six
groups we considered, although this appears to be driven primarily by very high
mortality in the general population.
Fourth, there seems to be a distinctive imprisonment-mortality relationship for
Hispanic female state prisoners in New York, although given the small number of
deaths among this group from 2001-2010 (20), this conclusion should not be oversold.
Hispanic female inmates in New York were at a significant mortality disadvantage
[SMR = 3.32; 95% CI: 1.82 to 4.88] relative to Hispanic females in the general
population of New York. Because of how intriguing this finding is and how small an N
it is based on, additional tests for the robustness of this relationship are especially
needed since this finding would be quite provocative if it held up to further scrutiny.
This study nonetheless has some notable limitations. First, we were able to
consider the imprisonment-mortality relationship in only nine states for males and
seven for females. Second, we were only able to consider the imprisonment-mortality
relationship for Hispanics in two states. Future research should provide a more
comprehensive portrait of the imprisonment-mortality relationship - especially for
Hispanics. Third, the number of Hispanic female prisoners who die, even in populous
states such as New York, is small enough that our results should be considered with
reservations. Fourth, our analysis is descriptive, and hence, it is unclear whether any of
the relationships we uncovered are causal. Fifth, because our data are drawn from
administrative sources, we lack a self-reported measure of race/ethnicity. Finally, we
Demographic Research: Volume 34, Article 12
http://www.demographic-research.org 369
considered only total mortality rates, and future research using these data might also
consider causes of death.
Limitations aside, this article enhances our understanding of the relationship
between imprisonment and mortality by providing insight into state-level variation in
this relationship for black, white, and Hispanic males and females. The results suggest
that although cross-state variation in mortality in the general population is greater than
variation in mortality in the penal population, there is nonetheless significant variation
in mortality in the penal population, calling for further investigation of conditions of
confinement that might shape the mortality of inmates.
