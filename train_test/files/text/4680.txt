The ultimate popularity of circumcision depended not on
convincing normal men to undergo the ordeal of surgery, but on
targeting a group of patients who could not object.
--David Gollaher
The controvertists, answered my father, assign two and twenty
different reasons for it: others indeed, who have drawn their
pens on the opposite side of the question, have shewn the world
the futility of the greatest part of them.
--Laurence Sterne, Tristram Shandy
Recent restatements of the case for non-therapeutic circum-
cision (NTC) of normal male infants and boys rest their case
on the proposition that the benefits are so great and the risks
so small that the operation should be widely (perhaps even
universally) performed.1 They also assume that circumcision
will be performed in infancy or early childhood, and propose
(usually without detailed argument) that removal of the fore-
skin from non-consenting children is permissible within
accepted principles of bioethics and human rights. When
challenged on these points, advocates argue that infancy is
the best time for the operation because it is simpler and
cheaper at that age, provides the greatest benefits, and per-
mits parental choice. In this article, it is argued that these
propositions are medically and logically questionable, that it
is far from certain that circumcision provides significant net
benefit to males in developed countries, and that the prefer-
ence for circumcising infants (rather than recommending the
operation as a health precaution to competent adults) has
more to do with history, habit, and power than with the inter-
ests of the child.
NTC of normal male infants and boys has been such a
familiar feature of Anglophone medical practice that it is dif-
ficult to appreciate what an anomaly it is. Surgical removal
of body parts normally requires proof of pathology, efforts at
non-surgical (medical) cure, and valid informed consent. In
the case of circumcision of healthy male minors, none of
these conditions is met. In this article, it is argued that the
reasons for this peculiarity are not to be found in the familiar
litany of benefits and risks advanced by circumcision advo-
cates and financially interested providers; they must rather
be sought in the history of medical knowledge, the structure
of the profession, and the advance of technology. As histo-
rian David Gollaher points out, had circumcision not become
established in Anglophone societies in the Victorian era, and
in view of the development of evidence-based medicine, the
advance of bioethics and the recognition of children's rights
since that time, "no physician would dream of proposing
such a thing today." Furthermore, considering the parallel

Targeting Patients Who Cannot Object?
Re-Examining the Case for Non-
Therapeutic Infant Circumcision
Robert Darby1
Abstract
Recent restatements of the case for routine circumcision of normal male infants and boys typically base their arguments on a
range of medical evidence showing circumcision to have a protective effect against certain pathological conditions. It is then
assumed that this evidence leads automatically to a clinical recommendation that circumcision should either be "considered"
or strongly urged. Closer analysis reveals that the recommendation of infant or child circumcision has less to do with the
medical benefits than with the historic origins of the procedure, the convenience to the operator and the status of the
patient. It is further suggested that it is not clear that the medical benefits of infant or child circumcision outweigh the risks
and harms, and that this style of advocacy fails to pay due regard to basic principles of bioethics and human rights that are
accepted in other areas of medical practice.

case of female genital cutting/mutilation, he suggests that if
"circumcision [of boys] were confined to developing nations,
it would by now have emerged as an international cause cele-
bre, stirring passionate opposition from . . . the global human
rights community" (Gollaher, 2000, p. xiv). Although there
are community-based anti-circumcision movements in many
countries, particularly the United States, it remains true that
the response from mainstream human rights and bioethical
institutions has been surprisingly muted (Carpenter, 2014).
A Brief History of Routine Medical
Circumcision
Circumcision of boys was introduced in mid-19th-century
United Kingdom and United States as a means of controlling
manifestations of juvenile sexuality (principally "masturba-
tion," by which was meant any fondling of the genitals) and
as a treatment for what became known as "congenital phimo-
sis" (Darby, 2005; Glick, 2005; Hodges, 2005). Under the
influence of nerve force theory, phimosis (i.e., a tight and/or
non-retractable foreskin) was blamed for a host of pathologi-
cal conditions, from epilepsy to bed-wetting. It was also seen
as an incitement to penis fondling, and thus to masturbation,
then regarded as both a moral crime and the cause of many
diseases, both real and imaginary,2 and behavioral problems.
At first, circumcision was performed ad hoc on boys caught
playing with their penis or found to have an adherent or oth-
erwise non-retractable foreskin. But as doctors discovered
the scale of these problems--hardly surprising, as nearly all
boys masturbated, and a tight, non-retractable foreskin is the
normal condition of the juvenile penis (Agarwal, Mohta, &
Anand, 2005; Cold & Taylor, 1999)--they wondered whether
it was their duty as far-sighted health providers to take action
before these problems produced their damaging conse-
quences. The transition of circumcision from a case-by-case
therapy to a general prophylactic was registered in Dr.
Norman Chapman's observation that the incidence of adhe-
sive foreskins was probably far higher than people realized.
Because "a long and contracted foreskin" was so often a
source of "secondary complications," he proposed in 1882
that it was "always good surgery to correct this deformity . . .
as a precautionary measure, even though no symptoms have
as yet presented themselves" (Gollaher, 2000, p. 84). He
might well have been following the advice of Erichsen's
(1877) Surgery:
So great are the evils resulting not only from congenital phimosis,
but from an abnormally long, though not phimotic, prepuce, that
it is only humane and right from a moral point of view, to practise
early circumcision in all such cases. (Vol. II, p. 932)
If it was scientifically valid, it had to be morally right.
Another U.S. doctor who had become a circumcision convert
after discovering that it could cure brass poisoning went
further:
Whether it be curative or not it [circumcision] is conservative,
and removes one source of irritation from an exquisitely
sensitive organ. I would favour circumcision, however,
independent of existing disease, as a sanitary precaution . . . (1)
The exposure of the glans to friction etc. hardens it, and renders
it less liable to abrasion in sexual intercourse, and consequently
venereal ulcer. (2) It is acknowledged to be useful as a preventive
of masturbation. (3) It certainly renders the accident of phymosis
and paraphymosis impossible. (4) It prevents the retention of
sebaceous secretion and consequent balanitis. (5) It probably
promotes continence by diminishing the pruriency of the sexual
appetite. (Gollaher, 2000, p. 85)
As Gollaher (2000) remarks, these declarations and many
like them represent an important transition in thought:
Circumcision becomes not just a treatment for existing prob-
lems, but an anticipatory intervention designed to prevent
possible problems in the future.
By the turn of the century, it was accepted that circumci-
sion was generally desirable as a means of preventing mastur-
bation, phimosis, venereal disease, certain forms of cancer,
and various minor penis problems loosely grouped under the
catch-all heading of "balanitis," as well as reducing the male
sex drive (Darby, 2005). Most of the real medical problems in
this list occurred in adults rather than children, but because
adult men were not exhibiting much eagerness to get them-
selves circumcised, the doctors concentrated on the younger
generation. As Gollaher (2000) sums up, "The ultimate popu-
larity of circumcision depended not on convincing normal
men to undergo the ordeal of surgery, but on targeting a group
of patients who could not object" (p. 100). Take-up of the
procedure was inhibited, however, by the difficulty of the
operation (often quite messy and bloody, especially in infants
and young boys), the lack of suitable instruments, and the
high incidence of complications, including deaths from infec-
tion and bleeding. These obstacles were gradually overcome
by the progress of aseptic surgery and, in the 1930s, with the
development of effective antibiotics and a purpose-built
device--the Gomco clamp. This was the brainchild of U.S.
gynecologist HiramYellen and businessmanAaron Goldstein,
owner of the Goldstein Manufacturing Company (Yellen,
1935). They claimed to have invented an instrument so ele-
gant in design and so simple to use that even an untrained
intern, accoucheur or general practitioner (GP) could easily
perform circumcision procedures with a negligible incidence
of complications and a neat result. Whatever the truth of those
claims, the device took off, and it remains the instrument of
choice among U.S. circumcision providers to this day, rivaled
only by the Plastibell (Glick, 2005; Wan, 2002). In 1941,Alan
Guttmacher, professor of obstetrics at Johns Hopkins, recom-
mended the "gadget," and discussed "phimosis" (foreskin
tightness) and prevention of masturbation among the reasons
the baby should be circumcised (Guttmacher, 1941).
The ubiquity of routine infant circumcision in the United
States was thus the result, not of any clinical trials or other
research demonstrating the value of circumcision in improving
Darby 3
child health, but of a power play within the medical profession
and the temptations of technology. The Gomco clamp allowed
the obstetricians to become the dominant players in the circum-
cision market, replacing the midwives who had previously
been responsible, and cutting out the pediatricians and urolo-
gists (who were left with the task of repairing the botches)
because they could perform the operation as a routine part of
the childbirth process at a significantly lower cost to the par-
ents: Unlike operations performed by surgeons, Gomco cir-
cumcisions were done without anesthetic. Contrary to Yellen's
claim, the Gomco did not ensure "bloodless" surgery, but its
design characteristics did produce a standardized, radically
denuded organ, which has come to be widely regarded as the
"normal" condition of the U.S. penis. Specialists in women's
health and midwifery thus became the branch of the medical
profession with prime responsibility for delicate operations on
intimate parts of the male body of which they had no expert
knowledge, and it was the incorporation of circumcision as a
routine phase of childbirth that has been the most important
factor in the persistence of NTC in the United States (Cohen,
2011; Darby, 2013b; Hodges, 1997). The non-development of
this division of professional responsibilities in other countries
that adopted circumcision (the United Kingdom, New Zealand,
Australia, Canada) helps to explain why routine circumcision
has largely died out in these regions. The fact that it was the
pediatricians who saw the complications helps to explain why
they were the ones who took the initiative in discouraging the
practice (Leitch, 1970).
The importance of the obstetricians in promoting routine
circumcision of infants is further highlighted by a key paper
from 1953 that consolidated the principle that the earlier cir-
cumcision was performed, the better. According to the authors,
Richard Miller and Donald Snyder, the principal "indications"
for circumcision were to promote "hygiene" and to prevent
phimosis, venereal disease, and cancer of the penis. Additional
(disputed) advantages were to discourage masturbation,
increase the male libido, and promote longevity. Despite the
fact that the only real benefits in this list accrue to adults rather
than children, the authors went on to list nine additional reasons
as to why circumcision should ideally be performed immedi-
ately after birth, and certainly before mother and child are dis-
charged from the hospital. These include (a) greater safety, (b)
lower incidence of complications, (c) faster healing, (d) conve-
nience, (e) opportunity for close observation, (f) simpler to
ensure sterile environment, (g) operation wakes sleepy babies
up,3 (h) faster healing and lower incidence of infection, and (i)
less pain than if done later.
The authors had little evidence for any of these assertions,
but it is clear that the most important factors in their mind
were not the health and well-being of the child, but expedi-
ency and cost. As they explain under the "Convenience"
heading,
Prior to this new plan . . . a line-up on Sunday morning was
routine. It meant an extra hospital trip, a good deal of unavoidable
delay between cases, and the resulting traffic problem in the
birth rooms was prodigious. Under the present regime the
obstetrician finishes his episiotomy, walks across the hall and
circumcises the infant, and is finished with the whole business.
The time saved for both the physician and nursing staff is
considerable. (Miller & Snyder, 1953, p. 4)
So impressed were Miller and Snyder with the efficiency
of their production line that they returned to its advantages in
their conclusion, there making the additional points that
"there is no conflict in the scheduling of cases, and no babies
are forgotten and left uncircumcised" (p. 10). For all those
reasons, "as well as those of economy, convenience, safety,
rapidity of healing and close observation," they continued,
"we feel that immediate circumcision of the newborn male
infant might well be more universally adopted" (p. 10). As
indeed it was, though only in North America. Although the
practice became rare in the United Kingdom and began to
decline in Australia and New Zealand during the 1950s, rou-
tine circumcision did not reach its peak incidence in the
United States until the 1970s (Darby, 2013b; Hodges, 1997;
Wallerstein, 1980).
The New (African) Evidence
Routine circumcision declined in the 1970s after critical
statements from pediatric health bodies in Australia, Canada,
and the United States,4 the aim of which was to try to halt a
practice that their 19th-century forebears had initiated.
Whereas these efforts had a substantial impact in Australia
and a moderate impact in Canada, they made only a small
difference to the incidence of circumcision in the United
States, where large sections of the medical profession
remained committed to the belief in the value of the opera-
tion. The effect of this intransigence has been to spawn two
contradictory trends: a vigorous, community-based anti-cir-
cumcision movement; and in response to this, a reassertion
of Victorian arguments for the medical benefits of circumci-
sion, fortified with "new evidence" whenever available.
Like their predecessors, the new generation of advocates
rely most heavily on evidence that circumcision has a protec-
tive effect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
especially HIV.5 The problem is that children are not sexu-
ally active; that most of this "new evidence" is from studies
of circumcision of adult males, not infants; and that it derives
from African countries with very different social and epide-
miological environments from those in the developed West
(Green et al., 2010). Whether or not the evidence from the
clinical trials is sufficient to justify the massive scale of the
African circumcision programs, advocates of widespread
circumcision in developed countries stretch it far beyond its
logical and geographical limits, asserting that it constitutes a
"compelling" argument (a) for circumcising infants and (b)
applying the programs universally, regardless of the local
conditions, no matter how different they may be from the
4 SAGE Open
regions where the evidence was generated (Bossio, Pukall, &
Steele, 2014). The rhetorical maneuver by which they
achieve these leaps should be examined because it involves a
cluster of logical errors and failures of ethical awareness that
inhibit clear thinking about the ethics, benefits, risks, and
harms of NTC as a medically rationalized procedure in
developed nations.
The fundamental flaw in this argument is that it rests on a
logical fallacy that may be called the health benefits logical
slide. It comes in two forms. The original form conflates
children and adults as subjects of medical concern and of
ethical consideration:
1. A range of evidence suggests that the surgical
removal of the adult foreskin may reduce a male's
risk of contracting certain infectious diseases to
which he may later be exposed and may also alleviate
some other potential problems.
2. It follows that doctors should remove the foreskin of
all infant males as a routine precaution.
The second form of this fallacy is a more recent develop-
ment, modeled on the first, which fails to distinguish not
only between adults and children but also between sub-Saha-
ran Africa and developed (Western) nations with radically
different social and epidemiological environments:
1. Three clinical trials and some other evidence suggest
that in the sub-Saharan African environment, surgical
removal of the foreskin may significantly reduce a
male's risk of contracting HIV through unprotected
heterosexual intercourse.
2. It follows that doctors should remove the foreskin of
all infant males as a precaution against HIV/AIDS,
not only in sub-Saharan Africa but also in the United
States and in other developed nations.
Expressed as baldly as this, the non-sequiturs involved in
the above arguments should be evident. Yet, in various forms,
the logical leap from (1) to (2) in the original form of the fal-
lacy has been marketed relentlessly by circumcision advo-
cates over the past decade. So ingrained in Anglophone
countries is the idea that circumcision means circumcision of
infants that we even hear the term "elective circumcision"
used to mean, not a free choice by an adult for himself, but
rather parents making the decision on behalf of a child
("Should Elective Circumcision," 2012). The second form is
a recent refinement but suffers from the same flaws. Both
arguments appear regularly in both the popular media and in
professional journals, both prestigious and obscure (Cooper,
Wodak, & Morris, 2010; Morris, Wodak, et al., 2012; Tobian
& Gray, 2011).6 For those committed to evidence-based and
ethically aware medical practice, the uncritical acceptance of
this sort of rhetoric by the media and health authorities
should be a cause for concern.
The first objection to these arguments is that the original
premise of both--that the surgical removal of the foreskin con-
fers lifelong health benefits that exceed the risks of surgery and
the harms of losing a visually prominent and sexually functional
body part--has not been established. Reviews of this question
by competent authorities (such asAustralian Safety and Efficacy
Register of New Interventional Procedures [ASERNIP], 2008;
Hutcheson, 2004; Perera, Bridgewater, Thavaneswaran, &
Maddern, 2010) have failed to confirm the claims of significant
benefit, and after a detailed review of the evidence, Malone and
Steinbrecher (2007) conclude that the only indications for cir-
cumcision in childhood were intractable cases of phimosis
caused by balanitis xerotica obliterans and recurrent balanopos-
thitis. Surveys by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation
and Development (2009) and Dewey and Fisher (2013) show
that children in the United States (where circumcision is com-
mon) fare less well on several heath indicators than in compara-
bly developed European countries where circumcision is rare.
There are certainly many confounding socio-economic factors
in play here, but health statistics do not support the proposition
that circumcision improves child health outcomes. Studies in
Australia (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW],
2010) similarly bear out the converse: that a substantial decline
in circumcision incidence did not lead to worse child health
outcomes.
The Opinion of Child Health
Authorities
It is also significant that, with one semi-exception, all the medi-
cal organizations that have issued policy statements on infant
or child circumcision have found that there is no justification
for it as a routine health precaution.7 The exception is the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), whose 2012 policy
statement has been widely (though inaccurately) interpreted as
a recommendation for circumcision. In fact, the AAP does not
recommend the operation or regard it as medically necessary,
but concludes merely that the benefits exceed the risks. Even
this moderate position has been criticized on empirical grounds
by child health experts (Frisch et al., 2013) and on logical and
philosophical grounds by others (Darby, 2015; Svoboda & Van
Howe, 2013).8 What is interesting about the AAP policy is not
its central contention, but a couple of subsidiary conclusions
that are not backed up by any real evidence at all: first, that it is
legitimate for parents and doctors to circumcise for cultural and
religious reasons; and second, that it is appropriate for medical
insurance systems (both government and private) to pay for cir-
cumcision procedures. To take the second point first, the AAP
offers no argument as to why it is acceptable for systems
intended to improve health to pay for cultural or religious ritu-
als. As Adler (2011) argues, if a medical procedure is neither
clinically necessary nor recommended, it may be unlawful for
Medicare to fund it.
As to the first point, I do not wish to make an argument
about the ethics of religious and culturally motivated
Darby 5
circumcision, but point out that the timing of the operation in
these instances is not dictated by health considerations or the
best interests of the child, but by the traditions of the culture.
Most circumcising cultures perform the operation around
puberty, signifying the boy's (and in most cases also the girl's)
transition from childhood to adult responsibility. Exceptions to
this pattern are found in Islam, which sets no specific age and
imposes no obligation on parents to circumcise their children
(AldeebAbu-Sahlieh, 1994); and in Judaism, which (uniquely)
prescribes circumcision in early infancy (the eighth day). There
was never any "health logic" to these rules, which were purely
a matter of tribal custom or religious tradition (Glick, 2005).
As indicated above, the AAP is quite isolated in its sup-
port for circumcision, moderate and equivocal though it is.
More typical of world opinion are the policies of the Royal
Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) and the Canadian
Paediatric Society (CPS). After a comprehensive analysis of
the relevant literature, the RACP concluded that "the fre-
quency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of
protection offered by circumcision and the complication
rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumci-
sion in Australia or New Zealand" (RACP, 2010, p. 5). The
CPS, Fetus and Newborn Committee (2015) concurs, "While
there may be a benefit for some boys in high-risk populations
. . . the Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend the
routine circumcision of every newborn male" (p. 311). What
makes the position of both these bodies all the more signifi-
cant is that they reached this conclusion on the basis of a
narrow calculus of risks and benefits and paid little attention
to the value of the foreskin to the individual and his possible
wishes in later life. There has never been a comprehensive
assessment of the complications of circumcision, some of
which (such as excessive tissue removal, leading to uncom-
fortable erections) may not become evident until after
puberty (Peterson, 2001). The value of the foreskin itself as a
functional body part that the individual might want to keep
and enjoy has rarely been factored into such harm­benefit
calculations as have been attempted.9 Both the reviews men-
tioned above and the policy statements of medical authorities
acknowledge evidence from Africa that circumcision of
adult males can reduce their risk of acquiring HIV through
unprotected intercourse with an infected female partner in
regions of high heterosexual HIV prevalence. But they point
out that these conditions are not present in developed coun-
tries and that children, not being sexually active, are not at
risk of sexually transmitted HIV (Bossio et al., 2014; Lyons,
2013). It is, therefore, far from clear that circumcision does
confer the benefits claimed by its promoters, undermining
the premise of both versions of the argument outlined above.
Questions of Logic and Evidence
These considerations bring us to the next stage of the argu-
ment: that even if premise 1--that circumcision did confer
lifelong health benefits--were granted, it would not follow
that the operation may ethically be performed on minors. The
argument of those who advocate routine neonatal circumci-
sion is now so familiar that it hardly needs detailed exposi-
tion: The health benefits of circumcision accrue to the
circumcised infant, on a probabilistic basis, at future points
in his life, some in infancy or childhood, but the bulk (and
most significant) in adulthood. They include such advan-
tages as a reduced risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs), phi-
mosis and minor penile problems in childhood, and of STIs
and rare forms of cancer in maturity. This list corresponds
closely to the Victorian trilogy that circumcision prevented
masturbation in childhood, syphilis in maturity, and cancer in
old age (Darby, 2005). The principal pillar of the case for
circumcision is not, therefore, the claim that it meets the
health needs of the infant or child, but that it improves the
health prospects of the adult he will later become. These
future benefits, it is claimed, not only outweigh the risks and
harms (physical, psychological, and emotional) of the proce-
dure but also justify (or even require) the widespread adop-
tion of circumcision as a preventive measure of public health.
None of these claims follows logically from the evidence.
Because the major benefits claimed--reduction in the risk of
STIs (including HIV)--can be enjoyed only by mature and
sexually active males, the logical prescription arising from
the premise is to provide the information to young adults and
allow them to elect to have their own foreskins removed if
they judge it to be prudent and are willing to face the risks
and losses. This would correspond to voluntary medical male
circumcision (VMMC), as recommended by the World
Health Organisation in regions with epidemic levels of het-
erosexually transmitted HIV and low circumcision preva-
lence. The fact that few adult males in developed nations do
choose to have themselves circumcised,10 and that forcing
men to submit to circumcision would be a criminal assault
under any legal code (or, if legally sanctioned, a gross viola-
tion of personal autonomy and individual human rights), is in
itself a powerful argument that it would be unethical to per-
form the same operation on infants or children, who cannot
resist.
Health Benefits of Circumcision
The health benefits claimed for circumcision fall into three
categories: (a) benefits to the person as a child, (b) benefits to
him as an adult, and (c) benefits to hypothetical third
parties.
Children
If pathological phimosis and UTIs (the principal benefits
claimed for early circumcision) were as common and as
infectious as, say, chicken pox and frequently fatal (or as
crippling as polio); if there were no effective treatments; and
if all boys were at equally high risk of these problems, it
might indeed be ethical to circumcise them in infancy as a
6 SAGE Open
precaution. These conditions do not, however, apply.
Pathological (as opposed to physiological) phimosis11 is an
uncommon condition, affecting approximately 0.6% of boys
by age 15 (or 0.04 cases per 100 person years), and it is usu-
ally curable by application of steroid ointment (Ashfield,
Nickel, Siemens, MacNeily, & Nickel, 2003; Shankar &
Rickwood, 1999). Minor penis problems grouped under the
heading "balanitis," if they arise, can usually be treated with-
out the need for surgery (Edwards, Bunker, Ziller, & van der
Meijden, 2014). Although severe persistent phimosis plus
poor hygiene may increase the risk of cancer of the penis in
later life, it is not in itself a pathological condition, and in
most cases causes little more harm than intermittent discom-
fort. Any adult so inconvenienced can easily take the neces-
sary medical or surgical steps. UTIs are also a rare condition,
affecting about 8% of girls and 2% of boys by age 7, and
usually associated with congenital abnormalities of the uri-
nary tract or bladder, or a preterm birth; most cases are read-
ily cured with antibiotics (Sureshkumar, Jones, Cumming, &
Craig, 2009). Persistent recurrent infections may be an indi-
cation for circumcision, but that is no justification for per-
forming the operation in advance of proven pathology (Na,
Tanny, & Hutson, 2015; Williams, Hodson, Isaacs, & Craig,
2012).12 Breast-feeding is highly protective against UTIs
(Marild, Hansson, Jodal, Odén, & Svedberg, 2004).
Adults
The benefits of circumcision to adult males are said to be
reduced risk of STIs (including HIV) and cancer of the penis.
The first point to make is that there is no consistent evidence
that circumcision does reduce the risk of STIs: Some studies
show uncircumcised men to be at greater risk of some STIs;
others that there is no difference; and yet others that circum-
cised men are at greater risk of some infections.13 There is
certainly no evidence that a high incidence of circumcision is
doing anything to restrain the spread of STIs in the United
States, which exhibits a far higher STI incidence than Europe,
where circumcision is rare (Centers for Disease Control,
2015; Paul, 2005). Whereas the prevalence of chlamydia,
gonorrhea, and syphilis has declined steadily in Europe since
1980, in the United States the incidence of all three has
steadily increased, and the incidence of gonorrhea is 20 times
higher: more than 100 cases per 100,000 persons, compared
with about five in Europe. Even more alarming is the far
higher incidence of HIV in the United States, particularly in
some cities: Washington, D.C., reports an incidence of 179.56
per 100,000--very similar to the epidemic levels found in
sub-Saharan Africa ("Americans Are More Likely to Have an
STD Than Europeans," 2015; Online Doctor, 2015).
These comparisons might be rejected on the basis that
they suffer from the "ecological fallacy"--that broad popu-
lation groups cannot validly be compared for statistical pur-
poses because this does not allow specific variables, such as
circumcision status, to be distinguished. It could be claimed,
for example, that in Europe, all the STI cases occur in uncir-
cumcised men and none in the circumcised. Against this
gambit, there is an increasing body of specifically U.S.
research comparing circumcised with uncircumcised men
showing that circumcision does not reduce the risk of STI
transmission or may even increase it. A study of men attend-
ing sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States
(Crosby & Charnigo, 2013) found that circumcised men had
double the incidence of STIs and were significantly less
likely to use condoms. This is the first U.S. study of condom
use that compared circumcised with normal men, and reached
a conclusion strongly at variance with the popular perception
that circumcised men are less susceptible to STIs and find it
easier to use condoms. On the contrary, as Crosby and
Charnigo (2013) point out,
These findings suggest quite the opposite in that intact men were
less likely to report UVS [unprotected vaginal sex] and less
likely to report infrequent condom use compared with their
circumcised counterparts. These two observations are quite
consistent with the descriptive finding that showed a greater
than two-fold past history of STIs for circumcised men compared
with intact men. (p. 177)
A further study (Crosby et al., 2015), this time of men
who have sex with men (MSM) in a southern U.S. city with
an "extremely high" HIV prevalence, found that there was no
difference in the incidence of HIV and other STIs between
circumcised and uncircumcised partners. The study also
found that circumcised men were twice as likely not to wear
a condom when taking the active role in intercourse. The key
point is that because condoms (even if worn inconsistently)
are the most effective means of HIV prevention, anything
that discourages condom use raises the risk of infection with
HIV and other STIs.
The second point is that the greatest risk factor for all these
diseases is a multiplicity of sexual partners, meaning that they
can be avoided by appropriate behavioral choices: care in
selection of partners and commitment to safe sex, including
consistent condom use in penetrative sex. The third point is
that most STIs are readily cured with antibiotics. An adult
male is entitled to choose circumcision in preference to a
course of penicillin, but it is far from an obviously rational
decision, and it is certainly not one that an adult is entitled to
make on behalf of a child. HIV remains incurable (though no
longer fatal and now manageable by anti-retroviral therapy),
but adult males are at high risk of STIs only if they engage in
high-risk sexual behavior. In the developed world, moreover,
unlike in Africa, HIV is not a heterosexual epidemic, but a
relatively rare disease largely confined to the sub-cultures
where it originated: homosexual men and injecting drug
users, neither of which groups derives any risk reduction
through circumcision (Darby & Van Howe, 2011).14 Because
the only means by which children could contract HIV is
through surgical procedures and blood transfusions, it is not
necessary to circumcise them as a precaution.
Darby 7
In the case of genital cancers and human papilloma virus
(HPV), similar points apply. Since the days of Jonathan
Hutchinson (Darby, 2005), circumcision advocates have
made much of the value of circumcision in preventing cancer
of the penis (Morris et al., 2011). Whether or not it does so is
less significant than the fact that penile cancer is a rare dis-
ease of older men--so rare that accurate statistics on inci-
dence are difficult to find, and so rare that it is even less
common than male breast cancer. The American Cancer
Society (2016) estimates that 2,600 cases of male breast can-
cer will be diagnosed in 2016 and that 440 men will die of it.
The figures for cancer of the penis are 2,030 cases and 340
deaths. If prophylactic removal of infant male breasts is not
recommended as a breast cancer preventive, there is cer-
tainly no need for prophylactic removal of the foreskin as a
penile cancer preventive. Replying to recent media claims,
the Australian Cancer Council (2012) warns that the evi-
dence of circumcision having a protective effect was not suf-
ficient to justify the operation on children. Because cancer of
the penis is usually associated with severe, persistent phimo-
sis, an adult male can reduce the danger by seeking either
medical or surgical treatment for the condition. Because
HPV--certain strains of which are now thought to be a caus-
ative or predisposing agent--is spread by sexual contact, it is
an infection that only sexually active adults can contract, and
there is no conclusive evidence from developed countries
that uncircumcised men are at any greater risk than the cir-
cumcised (Albero et al., 2014; VanBuskirk et al., 2011;
Weaver et al., 2004). The introduction of an effective vaccine
for both girls and boys, moreover, offers far greater protec-
tion than anything conferred by surgical alteration of the
genital anatomy. An adult male may prefer to get himself cir-
cumcised instead, but that does not oblige him to impose this
option on his children.
Third Parties
The third category is benefits to hypothetical others, namely,
the suggestion that boys ought to be circumcised to reduce
the risk of cervical cancer in future female sexual partners.
As Darby (2015) argues, however, the idea is morally unten-
able, for even if it were true that having an uncircumcised
partner increased a woman's risk of HPV infection and thus
cervical cancer, it is not ethically permissible to remove the
offending body part from a non-consenting child on the basis
that he might later become infected with HPV and might then
go on to infect hypothetical sexual partners sometime in the
future. Nobody would regard it as ethically acceptable to
take a child's blood, bone marrow, or any internal organ,
even if the transaction were sure to benefit another person
who might die without them; it cannot, therefore, be ethical
to remove a child's foreskin in the hope of providing a less
substantial benefit (risk reduction) to somebody whose iden-
tity is unknown. As Beauchamp and Childress (2009)
comment,
Obligations of non-maleficence are more stringent than
obligations of beneficence, and in some cases non-maleficence
overrides beneficence, even if the best utilitarian outcome could
be obtained by acting beneficently. If a surgeon, for example,
could save two innocent lives by killing a prisoner on death row
to retrieve his heart and liver for transplantation, this outcome
would have the highest net utility . . . but the surgeon's actions
would be morally indefensible. (p. 150)
With rare exceptions, medical interventions are permissi-
ble only when they are intended to benefit the person being
treated. While it is legitimate for a donor to supply bone mar-
row or a kidney, even though the operation benefits only the
recipient, this is on the basis that the donor volunteers and
understands what is at stake. It would be a gross violation of
medical ethics for any body part to be taken by force or with-
out informed consent, no matter how great the advantage to
the recipient.
Bioethical and Human Rights Principles
Because most circumcision advocacy places little emphasis
on bioethical and human rights issues, it is well to be reminded
of the basic principles of bioethics as set out by Beauchamp
and Childress (2009): autonomy (requiring respect for
informed choice), non-maleficence (not doing harm), benefi-
cence (doing good), proportionality (ensuring that the out-
come of the intervention provides a significant net benefit to
the patient in relation to the risks run and the losses sustained),
and justice (treating the person fairly). To establish the legiti-
macy of circumcision of non-consenting children, it is neces-
sary to show that the operation is consistent with these
principles, but it is difficult to find any circumcision advo-
cacy that discusses them in detail. Some circumcision advo-
cates seek to reverse the onus of proof by suggesting that not
circumcising a boy is a violation of his human rights because
it denies him both protection against the health risks attribut-
able to the foreskin and the advantages accruing from its
removal (Bates et al., 2013). But this is to assume that the
benefits of circumcision are as great as claimed (the very
point in dispute), that the foreskin is worthless and its removal
not a deprivation or even a harm, and that the boy's own pos-
sible future preferences are of no account.
To take the question of harm, despite arguments to the con-
trary by some moderate (parental choice) supporters of NTC,
it cannot plausibly be maintained that excision of the foreskin
is not a harm.15 Removal of normal tissue is not necessarily a
harm, for few people would be likely to mind if a healthy
appendix was extracted as a precaution, as it is imperceptible
and has no psychological significance. The genitals are a dif-
ferent matter: A visually prominent component of a body part
as sexually significant as the penis will never be regarded with
the same indifference, neither by admirers nor detractors.
Some advocates have likened circumcision to minor surgical
procedures such as cleft palate or hare lip repair or even orth-
odontic treatment; but the comparison fails because these are
8 SAGE Open
therapeutic procedures aimed at restoring anatomical normal-
ity and full physiological functionality. Moreover, as Brian
Earp (2015b) points out, there is no evidence that the benefi-
ciaries of these interventions object to what was done to them.
While we can observe a voluble anti-circumcision movement
in the United States and elsewhere,16 and cohorts of men who
deeply resent their circumcision and seek to restore their fore-
skins (Watson, 2015), it is not possible to detect any anti-cleft
lip repair movements or a surge of online communities dedi-
cated to recovering their crooked teeth. Leading exponents of
the view that parents have the right to circumcise their boys
acknowledge that circumcision is a harm, but argue that it is
not sufficiently harmful to warrant prohibition (Benatar &
Benatar, 2003; Cannold, 2006). That may be so, but the argu-
ment here is not whether NTC of minors should be illegal, but
whether it is of "compelling" net medical benefit and ethically
permissible.
Open Future, Best Interests, and
Substituted Judgment
Fundamental as they are, the Beauchamp and Childress prin-
ciples are not the only guidelines to be considered when we
perform surgical procedures on children. There is also the
question of the child's right to an open future, the best inter-
ests and substituted judgment tests, and the increasingly
prominent matter of human rights. These include a person's
right to physical integrity, as embodied in much Western law
and custom, and in certain international human rights treaties
and declarations. These rights are now generally accepted as
applying to girls, but if they are human rights they must, logi-
cally, apply to boys as well (DeLaet, 2009; Hellsten, 2004;
James, 1994; Johnson, 2010; Svoboda & Darby, 2008). In
the Victorian era that gave birth to circumcision, children
were to be seen but not heard and medical ethics were rudi-
mentary; but during the 20th century, the slow human rights
revolution (Pinker, 2011) that began with John Locke reached
children, who are now seen as possessing the same sort of
rights to bodily integrity and protection from harm that adults
enjoy (Orend, 2002). This does not mean that children have
equal rights as adults, but, as Brennan and Noggle (1997)
argue, that they are entitled to the same moral consideration
as adults because they are persons. At the same time, chil-
dren may be treated differently from adults by virtue of their
immaturity and dependent status, and parents have real but
limited authority to direct their upbringing. As Tobin (2013)
recently argues, because children have interests, they also
have rights, even though they (temporarily) lack the capacity
to articulate, much less enforce, them. The concept of the
child's right to an open future can provide a bridge between
the child's temporary lack of capacity and the preservation of
his long-term interests.
The child's right to an open future is an accepted principle
in legal philosophy, applied to bioethical issues by Dena
Davis (1997, 2001) and in recent times specifically to
circumcision (Darby, 2013a; Hainz, 2015; Sarajlic, 2014) and
surgical treatment of hypospadias (Carmack, Notini, & Earp,
2015). The principle holds that children are adults-to-be, and
that it is the duty of parents to make efforts to preserve and
protect their options so that they can make choices about mat-
ters of personal preference for themselves in adulthood. This
applies not only to the provision of affection, food, shelter
and education but also to freedom from irreversible and
potentially harmful decisions about their body that they might
later resent. If this extension is valid, the open future principle
would allow parents to compel children to brush their teeth
and prevent them from getting obtrusive marks such as a tat-
too, a nose-ring, or permanent genital modifications, and at
the same time would constrain them from imposing such
modifications. It would preclude deaf parents who believe
that deafness is a valid culture from deliberately causing their
children to be deaf. Forcing children to clean their teeth, pre-
venting them from smoking, and preserving their foreskin all
have the same rationale and objective: to maintain the body
for future use and to ensure that the future adult will be able
to make his own decisions about such matters when he
becomes responsible for his own self-management.
"Best interests" and "substituted judgment" are two tests
that may be applied when decisions have to be made on
behalf of those incompetent to make them for themselves,
whether minors or disabled adults. "Best interests" are the
long-term interests of the person as a person, taking account
of the society in which he or she lives, interests, skills, hopes,
wishes, values, self-image (among others), and if a minor the
person's interests in the future, as an adult. In the case of Re
J--Child's Religious Upbringing and Circumcision (2000),
for example, an English court determined that it would not be
in his best interests for a 6-year-old boy to be circumcised
merely because his Muslim father wanted him to be. A simi-
lar conclusion was reached by the Family Court of Australia
(2003) in the case of K and H. It would, however, be in the
child's best interests to be given necessary therapeutic medi-
cal treatment, such as a life-saving blood transfusion, even if
his parents were Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religion pro-
hibited such procedures. It would also be in his best interests
to be vaccinated against serious diseases, such as hepatitis B,
if he was at risk of infection (say from a parent with the dis-
ease), even if the parents were philosophically opposed to
vaccination (Isaacs, 2009). In both cases, the child's welfare
trumps the parents'wishes. When medical treatment is either
necessary to save a person's life, or provides proven and sub-
stantial benefits (such as immunity to serious diseases) with-
out harm, loss of body parts or function, and without a
significant risk of complications, it is acceptable to provide it
without the informed consent of the recipient.
The other test is the substituted judgment test--the option
that an incompetent person would be most likely to choose
for himself if he were competent to form and express an
opinion (Beauchamp & Childress, 2009). Analyzing this
concept, the legal scholar James Dwyer (1994) suggests that
Darby 9
children should not have fewer rights than or be treated with
less consideration than incompetent adults. Dwyer acknowl-
edges that infants and young children would not have shown
much evidence of preferences on any aspect of their lives,
but does not regard this as invalidating the substituted judg-
ment principle so long as there are reasonable grounds for
determining what the incompetent person would choose if he
or she were competent. One way of establishing the answer
in relation to medical issues is to ask what competent adults
choose when faced with the same question. Most adults
would agree to a blood transfusion if it meant the difference
between life and death, and most would agree to get vacci-
nated against a serious disease if they were likely to be
exposed to it and at risk of infection. The case of circumci-
sion is even more clear-cut: Because a negligible number of
adult men in Western societies elect circumcision for them-
selves, we may reasonably infer that if the average minor
were asked whether he wanted to get circumcised he would
refuse.
The Case for Infant Circumcision?
If the health benefits are not as great as claimed and the
important ones can be secured by voluntary circumcision in
adulthood, and if the ethical objections to NTC of minors are
greater than circumcision advocates allow, it follows that the
case for infant circumcision has not been made. The reasons
given for insisting on it in commentaries by Tobian, Gray,
Morris, and, with less enthusiasm, the AAP17 place too much
emphasis on the wishes of adults and not enough on the inter-
ests and autonomy of the child. Indeed, they scarcely go
beyond the narrow utilitarianism of Miller and Snyder: that it
is simpler, more convenient, cheaper, less painful, and
attended with fewer complications than if done later. The
first three points show insufficient regard for the interests of
the child, his autonomy, or even his personhood, but focus
entirely on the needs of adults and impersonal health sys-
tems. They are questionable because they ignore the funda-
mental point that medical interventions are not normally
permissible unless their intent, rationale, and result are to
benefit the person being treated. Procedures intended to ben-
efit other parties, as is the case if they are performed for rea-
sons of economy, convenience, or simplicity (here meaning
that a baby is more easily persuaded than an adult), fail both
the non-maleficence and beneficence tests and are plainly
unacceptable. By analogy, it is probably cheaper and more
convenient to have sex with an unwilling 5-year-old than
with an unwilling adult, but that does not make the practice
desirable.
If it is cheaper to circumcise children rather than adults
this is only because infants are usually circumcised as part of
larger process (the childbirth sequence), with inadequate
anesthesia, or none at all (Bellieni, Alagna, & Buoncore,
2013; Paix & Peterson, 2012). Given the dense innervation
of the foreskin (Cold & Taylor, 1999), any cutting in that area
is intensely painful, no matter what the age, but circumcision
is probably less painful for an adult because he can be given
both effective anesthesia and post-operative pain control,
and he can articulate his needs. To circumcise without effec-
tive anesthesia would be a gross violation of the non-malefi-
cence principle and extremely cruel: even supporters of a
parental right to circumcise regard such an omission as ethi-
cally unacceptable (Benatar & Benatar, 2003). Research into
the effects and complications of circumcision is too inade-
quate for anybody to know whether it is safer and less harm-
ful in infancy, childhood, or maturity.18 If mere cheapness is
the aim of health care, the best policy is to avoid unnecessary
surgeries (Van Howe, 2004). The "increased cost" argument
is based on the false assumption that circumcision will be
necessary at a later stage: In the vast majority of cases, cir-
cumcision will not be necessary, meaning that there will be
no costs at all.
A disturbing feature of much current circumcision advo-
cacy is the underlying assumption that the biomedical evi-
dence "speaks for itself"; once the evidence is available,
public policy should follow automatically as a logical conse-
quence. As de Camargo, Mendonca, Perrey, and Giami
(2015) comment, however, this is a technocratic and authori-
tarian approach that over-simplifies the complexities of med-
ical decision making, ignores social and other contextual
factors, dismisses bioethical and human rights principles as
nebulous, and considers "subjective" issues such as the value
of the foreskin and the preferences of the individual to be
irrelevant. Savulescu (2015) similarly warns against the ten-
dency to "scientify" everything: "Evidence will tell us what
to do, people believe. But what constitutes sufficient evi-
dence is an ethical decision," as is weighing risk and benefit
(p. 30). "Ethics is not peripheral to medicine and research--
it is central. What you study will determine what you find"
(p. 30). We typically hear arguments that circumcision is jus-
tified or not justified on the basis that the benefits exceed the
risks of the surgery or that the risks of surgery exceed the
benefits. But the risk­benefit rule was devised for therapeu-
tic procedures, where there is a pathological condition that
requires treatment. In the case of normal male infants and
boys, there is no pathology to treat, meaning that circumci-
sion is a non-therapeutic procedure, and hence should be
governed by far stricter rules. In the case of minors, who by
definition cannot give consent, the rules should be stricter
still. Furthermore, as Buchanan (1983) points out, risk­ben-
efit equations are not merely clinical (objective) calculations,
but moral judgments about a person's values and how he
wishes to manage his life. The principal quasi-ethical argu-
ment commonly advanced by circumcision advocates19 is
that parents are entitled to make medical decisions for their
children; because it is widely agreed that parents can provide
surrogate consent for a child to be vaccinated, they can
equally provide consent for a child to be circumcised. This
proposition is highly dubious. Although circumcision advo-
cates have sought to liken circumcision to vaccination, there
10 SAGE Open
are fundamental differences in mode of operation, effective-
ness, and personal outcomes, both bodily and psychological
(Forbes, 2009; Lyons, 2013). A logically invalid analogy
does nothing to support the case for circumcision.
Parental Rights or Parental Duties?
As for the parental rights argument, it is not parents who
need rights over their children, because they already have
full power over them. Parents have authority, but because
children are vulnerable, and infants a powerless and even
voiceless group, in need of special protection, they are the
ones who require and possess rights, and society places lim-
its, both moral and legal, on how parents may treat them.
Parents may not sell their children into slavery, subject them
to unreasonable corporal punishment, or have sex with them;
on the positive side, they must nurture and care for their chil-
dren, provide them with an adequate education, and socialize
them into the ways of society. It follows that parents do not
have an unfettered right to choose medical treatments for
their children, and it has been argued that parents have no
legal right to authorize controversial or non-recommended
medical treatments for their children, and certainly not if it
involves unnecessary removal of healthy body parts
(Povenmire, 1998-99). Forty years ago, William Bartholome
was concerned about the wide discretion conferred by proxy
consent and disputed the assumption that parents had "the
right to make all medical care decisions involving a minor
child." Because children, in his view, belonged primarily to
themselves, he proposed the following principles for pediat-
ric care:
1. Any proposed medical intervention that could be delayed,
without significant adverse consequences, until the child
could provide his own consent would be prima facie wrong.
2. Any medical intervention for which there is no demonstrable
need would be prima facie wrong--e.g. circumcision.
3. Any medical intervention that holds out the prospect of
demonstrable benefit to the child whose life or well-being
were in jeopardy would be prima facie obligatory--e.g.,
immunizations. (Bartholome, 1981, pp. 271-272, 275)
In other words, what parents have is an obligation to pro-
tect their children's rights and provide appropriate, beneficial,
and needed treatment that is manifestly in the child's best
interests, has regard to the open future principle, and satisfies
the substituted judgment test--that it was a decision a reason-
able adult would be expected to reach for himself. A parent is
not entitled to provide a sick child with harmful, inappropri-
ate, or spurious treatments (such as faith healing or bogus
"alternative" cures), or to deny a healthy child vaccination
against serious diseases of which he is at risk (Isaacs, 2009).
Rejecting the argument that observance of a "harm threshold"
is an adequate yardstick for parental decisions about medical
treatment of children, Birchley (2016a, 2016b) argues that
parents are not automatically entitled to deny them beneficial
and necessary treatments; and, it follows that they are not
entitled to impose harmful or unnecessary treatments. In these
situations, medical personnel may be entitled (even morally
obliged) to override parental wishes, either by insisting on a
beneficial intervention to which parents object, or by refusing
an intervention that parents have sought. It is reasonable for
parents to have their children vaccinated against the risk of
future diseases because such prophylaxis protects them and
the community from diseases that affect them as children and
does not deprive them of a normal body part. Vaccination
may thus be assessed as being in the child's best interests and
also--as shown by the fact that adult men regularly get them-
selves vaccinated--as passing the substituted judgment test.
As Beauchamp and Childress (2009) point out,
Best interest judgments are meant to focus attention entirely on
the value of the life for the person who must live it, not on the
value of the person's life for others. "Quality-of-life" judgments
also concern only the individual's best interests, not his or her
worth to enhance another's quality of life. (p. 140)
It follows that, barring a genuine pathological condition for
which circumcision is the only cure, the only person entitled
to make a health-based decision about such surgery is the
person who must live with the consequences.
Routine Peripubertal Circumcision?
Recognizing that if circumcision does offer significant health
benefits they do not apply until adulthood, some commenta-
tors have suggested that infant circumcision be abolished and
replaced with "elective" circumcision in late childhood or
early adolescence (around 11 years of age). As MacDonald
(2011) points out,
There is no new evidence that infant circumcision provides any
added benefit to the neonate, infant or young child with respect
to HIV and HPV protection. The potential benefit from
circumcision only begins to accrue when the male becomes
sexually active. (p. 872)
Accordingly, "the important question for . . . pediatric societ-
ies is not about a change in infant circumcision recommenda-
tions, but rather the need to address whether there would be
merit in routine peripubertal male circumcision." This is an
interesting idea, but there is clearly a difference between
offering circumcision to an 11-year-old boy and performing
it routinely at that age, as in South Korea or the Philippines
(Glick, 2009; Kim & Pang, 2002), and MacDonald goes on
to make the dubious suggestion that an 11-year-old can give
informed consent. Although a boy at that age would indeed
be more competent to give informed consent than he was at
6 weeks or 6 months, it is still difficult to accept that he
would have sufficient competence to consent to an
Darby 11
irreversible alteration to a central part of his genital anatomy.
Few boys of that age would have adequate maturity of judg-
ment or knowledge of both what the operation entailed and
its short- and long-term consequences, and many would be
subject to such strong parental, peer, and social pressures that
they would not be capable of making a free choice. The earli-
est age at which a person is held to be competent to consent
to sexual relations is 16 or 18; it is hard to see why the rules
for irreversible genital alterations should be less strict than
those governing sexual relations.
MacDonald's suggestion was picked up by the Canadian
media, and attracted comments that demonstrated, yet again, the
depth of the Anglophone assumption that circumcision means
circumcision of infants. One medical practitioner was reported
as stating that the idea was unacceptable because "If you explain
to any 11-year-old what you were proposing, likely an 11-year-
old would never consent to have that done." Quite--for as a
reader of the National Post ("Simon of Toronto") commented, it
would be hard to find a more convincing ethical argument as to
why circumcision of children should not be done at all:
That's about as solid an argument against circumcision as
anybody should need. Basically, he's saying that the best reason
to cut babies is because they can't tell you to stop. It neatly--and
brutally--clarifies the moral injustice of the practice. (Kirkey &
Fraiman, 2011)
The AAP (2012) concedes that
Newborn males who are not circumcised at birth are much less
likely to elect circumcision in adolescence or early adulthood.
Parents who are considering deferring circumcision should be
explicitly informed that circumcision performed later in life has
increased risks and costs. (p. e760)
So although the AAP does not recommend circumcision, it
still puts strong pressure on parents to have it done. Brian Morris
(1999) similarly admits that if the circumcision choice were left
tothem,manyboyswouldmakethe"wrong"decision."Parental
responsibility must override arguments based on the rights of
the child," he writes, "parents have the legal right to authorise
surgical procedures in the best interests of their children" (pp.
61-62). When they are old enough to give legal consent, males
"are reluctant to confront such issues" and are neither "mature
nor well-informed enough" to make the right decision for them-
selves. In other words, Morris concedes that if doctors waited
until boys were old enough to make up their own mind, most
would not consent to the operation. It would be hard to think of
a stronger argument as to why circumcision should not be done
before the person is able to provide informed consent.
Conclusion
I have sought to show that recent restatements of the medical
case for NTC of normal infants fail on three major points, one
ethical, one medical, and one logical. They do not demonstrate
that circumcision of non-consenting minors is permissible
within accepted principles of bioethics and human rights; they
fail to establish that the benefits are sufficiently great to out-
weigh the harms and risks; and, they do not show that circum-
cision must be performed in infancy to secure the major benefits
claimed for it. Even if it were true that circumcision did confer
all the health benefits claimed, and ignoring such unsettled
questions as complications and the harms arising from loss of
the foreskin, the ethical principles governing surrogate consent
for surgical procedures on incompetent persons would not
allow the operation to be performed on normal infants or other
minors. Even if circumcision did confer a significant reduction
in the risk of contracting certain diseases in adulthood, such as
STIs, it does not follow that circumcision must be performed in
infancy. If that were the case, the expensive African programs
for mass circumcision of adults as a tactic against heterosexu-
ally acquired HIV would be pointless. Despite mounting con-
cern that these programs are less effective and more risky than
commonly believed,20 advocates still consider circumcision as
a means of reducing the risk of HIV and other STIs to be no
less effective in adulthood as in childhood.
That being so, why do their arguments for circumcision in
developed countries such as the United States and Australia
focus on circumcision of infants? I have argued that the answer
to this question leads us into an ethical and logical void: The
preference for circumcising infants has little to do with the
greater efficacy of the intervention in early life, and almost
everything to do with its mechanics. Adult men are usually
reluctant to be circumcised and are not readily coerced; infants
and children have less power to resist and can easily be com-
pelled to submit. Because they are incapable of saying no, chil-
dren are a softer target. The notion of infancy as the "best time
to circumcise" is based on the assumption that prophylactic
circumcision is desirable for all and that it will be necessary at
some point: If later, the argument goes, why not do it now and
get it over with (Wallerstein, 1980)? But if prophylactic cir-
cumcision is neither desirable nor necessary, and if unneces-
sary surgery is "bad" surgery (Begg, 1953, p. 604), the only
appropriate times to circumcise are when it is clinically neces-
sary to address a problem that has not responded to medical
treatment; or, when a competent male elects the operation for
himself and gives his informed consent.

(2012); and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP; 2012).
Unless otherwise indicated, in this article, circumcision means
medically rationalized, NTC of male infants and other minors,
that is, circumcision performed on normal children in the belief
that it will improve their future health prospects. I am not con-
cerned with NTC performed for religious or other cultural rea-
sons. I follow the definition of non-therapeutic given by the
Tasmania Law Reform Institute (2009):
A circumcision is non-therapeutic if it is performed for any rea-
son other than remedying or treating an existing disease, illness
or deformity of the body . . . A circumcision performed for the
purpose of preventing or reducing the likelihood of possible future
disease, illness or deformity of the body (a prophylactic circumci-
sion) is a non-therapeutic circumcision. (p. 7)
As the Australasian College of Surgeons points out, "male NTC
is not clinically necessary as it does not treat an underlying patho-
logical process" (Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New
Interventional Procedures [ASERNIP], 2008, p. 3).
 2. Such as spermatorrhoea: see Rosenman (2003, Chapter 1) and
Darby (2005, Chapter 8).
 3. As well it might, especially as no anesthetic was provided.
 4. Statements from pediatric bodies are collected at http://www.
cirp.org/library/statements/ and http://www.circinfo.org/doc-
tors.html
 5. See references in Note 1.
 6. The somewhat equivocal position of the American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP) is discussed below.
 7. These include Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), Fetus and
Newborn Committee (2015); British Medical Association
(2007); Royal Dutch Medical Association (2010); and Royal
Australasian College of Physicians (RACP, 2010).
 8. I do not discuss the "guidelines" on circumcision issued by the
Centers for Disease Control in December 2014 because the
document is merely an exposure draft for public comment and
has no official status. Although cited by defenders of routine
circumcision, the document is vulnerable to many of the same
criticisms that have been leveled at the AAP policy statement.
For a thorough critique, see Earp (2015a).
 9. For an analysis of the weakness of the risk/benefit paradigm,
see Darby (2015).
10. As indicated in Australia by claims for reimbursement from
Medicare, the national health insurance scheme.
11. Pathological phimosis is usually associated with some sort
of infection, such as lichen sclerosus; physiological phimosis
is a normal developmental stage that most boys grow out of
naturally. The difference is explained in Dewan (2003) and
McGregor, Pike, and Leonard (2007).
12. Curiously, and suggestive of a certain schizophrenia within the
organization, the AAP's (2011) policy statement on manage-
ment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) does not recommend
circumcision as a preventive, but discusses it only as a treat-
ment in intractable cases.
13. The list of studies is as vast as it is inconclusive, but see Laumann,
Masi, and Zuckerman (1997); Dickson, van Roode, Herbison,
and Paul (2008); Ferris et al. (2010); and Van Howe (2013).
14. There is a disturbing increase in HIV incidence among hetero-
sexual African Americans, whose lifetime risk is considerably
greater than other ethnic groups (Sansom et al., 2010). The
reasons for this are obscure, but not related to the foreskin,
because African Americans exhibit higher circumcision preva-
lence than either Hispanics or Whites.
15. For a detailed argument, see Darby (2015). There are United
States legal decisions stating explicitly that unnecessary sur-
gery is ipso facto harmful: see Adler (2013).
16. Too voluble, according to hostile critics such as Mark Stern (2013).
17. See Note 1.
18. There are no studies comparing complications rates in infant
versus adult circumcision, and very few have looked at the com-
plication rates of neonatal and later circumcision based on the
same population and using the same definitions. Machmouchi
and Alkhotani (2007) find higher complication rates in neonates,
whereas Yegane et al. (2006) find no difference.Arecent study of
child circumcision in Melbourne (Gold, Young, O'Brien, & Babl,
2015) found a higher incidence of complications in boys aged
below 4 months. The question is not whether neonatal is safer
than circumcision at, say, 2 or 3 years of age, but whether circum-
cision in childhood (below 16 years) is safer than in adulthood.
19. For example, Tobian and Gray (2011) and Morris, Waskett,
et al. (2012).
20. As argued by Boyle and Hill (2011) and Ncayiyana (2011).
See the debate in the special issue of Global Public Health,
Vol. 10 (5-6), June 2015.
