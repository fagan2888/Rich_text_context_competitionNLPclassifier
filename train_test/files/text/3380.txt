Abstract
The study describes how relationships are created with persons with moderate to severe
dementia. The material comprises 24 video sequences of Relational Time (RT) sessions,
24 interviews with persons with dementia and eight interviews with professional caregivers.
The study method was Constructivist Grounded Theory. The categories of `Assigning time',
`Establishing security and trust' and `Communicating equality' were strategies for arriving at the
core category, `Opening up', which was the process that led to creating relationships. Both parties
had to contribute to create a relationship; the professional caregiver controlled the process, but
the person with dementia permitted the caregiver's overtures and opened up, thus making the
relationship possible. Interpersonal relationships are significant to enhancing the well-being of
persons with dementia. Small measures like RT that do not require major resources can open
paths to creating relationships.

Introduction
Person-centred care is considered a prerequisite for providing successful dementia care
(Kitwood, 1997; NHS & SCIE, 2006; Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare,
2010). An essential element of person-centred care is that the caregiver attempts to
establish a relationship with the person with dementia (National Board of Health and
Welfare, 2010, p. 21). The relationship between the caregiver and the person with
dementia is crucial to person-centred care because interpersonal relationships are

considered essential to successful care outcomes (Davies & Nolan, 2008; McCormack, 2004).
Creating relationships with persons with dementia can, however, often be perceived as
arduous, due to lack of understanding about how relationships are established (Adams,
2008; Allan & Killick, 2008; Dewing, 2004; Ericsson, Hellstro
¨ m, & Kjellstro
¨ m, 2011).
The ability to create and maintain relationships is critical to the person with dementia's
sense of identity and feelings of personhood (Tester, Hubbard, Downs, MacDonald, &
Murphy, 2004). Since the person with dementia's capacity to create and maintain
relationships declines successively due to cognitive deficits, the caregiver's confirmation of
the person with dementia is critical to his or her sense of being somebody ­ a person
(Brooker, 2004; Davies & Nolan, 2008; Edvardsson, Winblad, & Sandman, 2008; Malloy
& Hadjistavropoulos, 2004). Confirmation from others is the foundation for developing a
relationship with the person with dementia (Harman & Clare, 2006; Malloy &
Hadjistavropoulos, 2004; Penrod et al., 2007; Sabat, 2002).
Persons with dementia want relationships with other people and are capable of having
them, even when the dementia is advanced, but others must take the initiative to create and
maintain the relationship (Penrod et al., 2007). Hellstro
¨ m, Nolan, & Lundh (2005) describe
how a married couple maintain couplehood, despite the wife's far advanced dementia. Both
parties describe the relationship as entirely possible and meaningful, but it required initiative
on the part of the husband to maintain it. Another study showed that relationships are
meaningful to persons with severe dementia. When asked what they enjoyed, they mentioned
activities such as coffee `klatches', a pastime that involves interaction and often a
relationship with another person (Cahill & Diaz-Ponce, 2011).
Norbergh, Helin, Dahl, Hellze
´ n, & Asplund (2006) studied professional caregivers'
attitudes towards persons with dementia and identified negative attitudes towards persons
with communication deficits and behavioural disorders as relational barriers. In these cases,
professional caregivers often avoided creating a relationship beyond interaction in the course
of basic nursing. McCallion, Toseland, Lacey, & Banks (1999) have shown, however, that
professional caregivers can be trained to interact more with persons with moderate to severe
dementia in order to facilitate relationships.
Relationship-centred care, considered an evolution of person-centred care, further
reinforces the importance of the relationship between the person who receives care and
the caregiver (Davies & Nolan, 2008; Nolan, Ryan, Enderby, & Reid, 2002; Ryan, Nolan,
Reid & Enderby, 2008). Davies & Nolan (2008) argue that in order to be person-centred
dementia care must be relationship-centred. Existing research emphasizes the importance of
relationships (Nolan, Davies, Brown, Keady, & Nolan, 2004; Ryan, Nolan, Reid, &
Enderby, 2008). There is a need, however, to increase understanding of how relationships
are established with persons with dementia, particularly with persons in more advanced
stages of dementia. The aim of this study is therefore to increase understanding of how
relationships can be created with persons with moderate to severe dementia.
Method
Context
The study was carried out at six residential units for persons with dementia in southern
Sweden where a method called `Relational Time' (RT) is used. RT is defined here as: A time
of interaction with the person with dementia (one-to-one). A way of activating/stimulating the
person with dementia that begins with the unique person's interests, wishes and capacity and
64 Dementia 12(1)
where focus is on the person. In this study, RT was used as an instrument to enable study
of how relationships with persons with dementia are created. The aim of RT is to
enhance activation and encourage interaction with the person with dementia. RT is
included in the day-to-day schedule so that all residents in the dementia unit will benefit
from the method, which must be provided with continuity, at least once a week, by a
caregiver who knows the person well. RT is documented in order to record activities that
persons with dementia are prevented by forgetfulness from relating themselves. Other
professional caregivers and relatives can also refer to the documentation and give each
other suggestions for suitable activities/occupations that promote interaction with the
person (Ericsson, 2006).
Procedure
How a relationship is created may be seen as a social process, which was studied here on the
basis of Charmaz's (2006) Constructivist Grounded Theory (GT). For this study, RT
sessions (n ¼ 24) were videotaped for 20À61 minutes and the person with dementia was
interviewed immediately after the taping. The professional caregiver was interviewed later.
In order to retain what Charmaz (2006) calls the `natural context', RT took place in the
usual, for the person with dementia, familiar environment and an undisturbed place with
only the caregiver and the person with dementia present. The interviews with the person with
dementia lasted 2À13 minutes and were conducted in the setting where the RT session had
taken place. The questions were brief here and now questions with a concrete connection
to the activity that had taken place. The persons with dementia were videotaped and
interviewed on three occasions, except for two persons, one of whom was
interviewed once and the other twice. All but one of the professional caregivers involved
in the RT sessions were interviewed once. Prior to the interview, the interviewer (IH) viewed
the videotape in which the professional caregiver was involved. The interviews with
caregivers lasted 19À31 minutes and consisted of open-ended questions (Polit, Beck, &
Hungler, 2001). When an interview triggered new questions, these were asked of the
next respondent in accordance with the method (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser & Strauss,
1967;). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the video-recordings were written
out in the form of field notes, comparable to the notes taken by a participant observer
(Fangen, 1995).
Participants
The dementia nurse or the division manager contacted potential participants. Nine
persons with dementia participated in the study, eight women and one man, ranging
in age from 75 to 97. They had been residents of the unit for three months to seven
years. All had a diagnosis of some type of dementia. The stage of dementia was
established according to the Functional Assessment Staging Test (FAST) (Reisberg,
1988), wherein the stage of dementia was assessed on a scale of 1À7, where a higher
figure denotes lower functional capacity. The participants' scores on the FAST scale
varied from 5À7 (FAST 5 ¼ n2; FAST 6c ¼ n2; FAST 6d ¼ n3; FAST 7a ¼ n1; FAST
7b ¼ n1). The professional caregivers, all women, had been providing care to persons
with dementia for 2À16 years.

Ethical considerations
Regional Ethical Review Board (reg.no.2010/30-31) reviewed the study from an ethics
standpoint. Before the study commenced, everyone involved was informed in writing and
orally about the aim of the study, that participation was voluntary and that confidentiality
would be maintained. Thereafter, oral information was provided on an ongoing basis before
each study occasion. Relatives gave oral consent to ask the person with dementia whether
they were willing to participate in videotaping of RT and to be interviewed. The persons with
dementia gave oral consent to participating before every videotaping session, since due to
memory deficits, consent given on one occasion cannot be deemed to apply to a later
occasion (Hellstro
¨ m, Nolan, Nordenfelt, & Lundh, 2007). The professional caregivers also
gave oral consent to the videotaping and individual interviews.
Data analysis
Initial analysis commenced as data were collected. The interviews and videotapes were
subject to constant comparison (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser & Strauss, 1967). All material
was coded based on Charmaz's (2006) recommended structure as follows: a) initial coding
in which text sequences were given substantive code names; b) focused or selective coding in
which substantive codes were grouped and given more abstract category names (`theoretical
coding'); and c) identification of relationships between categories and sub-categories in
theoretical integration (Charmaz, 2006). The core category, `Opening up', which explains
the process, emerged during theoretical coding.
Results
The `Opening up' process was necessary to establish the relationship with the person with
dementia. The strategies for reaching the core category, `Opening up', are the categories of
`Assigning time',`Establishing security and trust' and `Communicating equality', which are
all interrelated. The process took place when the person with dementia and the caregiver met
for a `Relational Time' session (RT). Both parties' participation was necessary to establish
the relationship, but the caregiver had the greatest responsibility and guided the process. The
contribution of the person with dementia was to be open to and permit the caregiver's
overtures. How the caregiver controlled the process determined whether the person
opened up to the caregiver's overtures.
Assigning time
One strategy used was `Assigning time', which the caregivers believed was a way to pay
attention to the person with dementia. The person was assigned time by the caregiver, but
also indirectly by the organization.
Caregiver (CG): . . . we used to do it [RT] when we had extra time. But now we make it [RT] a first
priority . . . and that the other comes . . . it's more allowed. And it's been decided by the
management and the bosses that this is a priority . . ..
`Assigning time' was clearly signalled to the person with dementia through the caregiver's
express statement: This is your time now. No signs that the caregivers were stressed or
66 Dementia 12(1)
expressed lack of time could be observed in any of the RT sequences. It was important,
according to the caregivers, that time was set aside for RT in the day-to-day schedule: ` . . . if
you've set the time aside . . . you listen, you know . . . you are there.' The persons with
dementia perceived that caregivers were genuinely relaxed and focused on them during
RT, for which they expressed appreciation.
Interviewer (I): . . . and those times are worthwhile?
Person with dementia (PWD): Yes, they are worthwhile [conviction in the tone of voice], they
are. She is so, she is so calm . . . otherwise she is run off her feet, but when she is here
then . . . [laughs].
It seemed, despite assurances from caregivers that time had been assigned for them, that
the persons with dementia still felt unsure that caregivers truly had time for RT.
Video sequence (VS): In the midst of an ongoing activity, the person suddenly asks: `Do you
really have time for this?' And then answers her own question: `No, you don't have much time,
do you?' The caregiver chuckles and says that she'll try to manage, since she knows the person
enjoys it. The person with dementia remarks that this is good, and then starts telling her story to
the caregiver again, who listens intently.
The persons with dementia sought to confirm whether there was really time for RT, which
could be interpreted as arising from fear of losing out on the session. There may have been a
need to check whether there was any point to opening up to a relationship that might quickly
be broken off again. In the interviews, the persons with dementia expressed that there were a
lot of people who had to share the caregiver's attention.
Feelings of significance
`Feelings of significance' was a dimension of `assigning time'. The persons with dementia
interpreted and expressed verbally that they felt like someone important when time was
assigned to them. Incidental chat while the caregiver performed other tasks was not of the
same quality as the one-to-one sessions.
I: . . . these sessions with a caregiver, you think, . . . are?
PWD: Oh, it's so nice [emphasis] because . . . they don't have time, they usually don't have time,
it's only when we eat and they are there and say a few words . . . when they come in and . . . make
the bed and so forth . . . No, I'm not complaining about them, I'm not.
I: It was interesting what you said about how when they are doing something and talking at the
same time, that's not really the same thing, is it?
PWD: No, it isn't . . . like when you sitting there just the two of you . . . that's different . . . oh,
yes . . .
The person with dementia was interpreted to have `Feelings of significance' when the
caregiver truly became intimate and personal. This lent a feeling of deep fellowship, a feeling
that was compared to earlier friendships:
PWD: There's something that makes it fun, that it's only one person, I think.
I: What is so good about it when there is just the two of you, do you think, when you are with
one member of staff like that?
Ericsson et al. 67
PWD: It is a little more personal somehow, don't you think? Yes, I think it is. I think it's almost
as if we had gone to school together, so that, it comes from so deep inside.
I: Do you mean it's almost like when you had friends at school?
PWD: [becomes obviously happy about my suggestion] Yes, that's what I mean, really close like
that. Oh yes, they are really, truly love partners here [laughs].
In the interviews, the persons with dementia expressed that the most important thing was
the caregiver's presence and attention during RT, not that anything was achieved.
Establishing security and trust
The category `Establishing security and trust' involved the caregiver's approaching the
person in a non-threatening way and taking pains to provide a sense of security and trust
by constantly adjusting to the person. In some cases, it seemed as if this was done when
contact was first made. The caregiver's suggestion to do something together could trigger
statements from the person with dementia like: `You're so nice', to which the caregiver
answered: `It's great that we can be together like this'. The goal seemed to be to establish
security and trust, a goal that could be observed sooner or later, but the process was
sometimes more prolonged. The reason for a varied or more prolonged process was
interpreted as serious intellectual deficits in the person with dementia. Conditions that
promoted the process were when the caregiver demonstrated responsiveness, made time,
repeated information and adapted her approach and how she treated the person when she
picked up signals that the person was annoyed. The task sometimes seemed difficult due to
the person's severe deficits, as revealed in the following example:
VS: The woman sits with her eyes closed and seems unresponsive to the caregiver's overtures.
On one occasion, the woman looks up at the caregiver and asks, `cold?' and then closes her
eyes again. The caregiver picks up the subject of `the weather', which she interprets the woman
to have initiated, and offers to go on a walk with her later that day. The woman looks at
her again and nods in reply. Hope can be seen in the caregiver's expression that she has got
through to the person, but silence falls again and the woman closes her eyes tightly. The
caregiver admires the woman's hair and gently caresses her head. She then begins to ask
intellectual questions about the woman's life. There is no response. The woman sits in her
wheelchair, eyes closed, head averted from the caregiver, who continues asking the woman
questions in various ways. Only when the caregiver begins to tell the person about an
everyday activity that had been done does the woman look up and seem to follow the
narrative. After a great deal of effort with various topics, the caregiver suggests that the
woman might want to lie down and rest for a while, which she agrees to. While the caregiver
helps the woman to bed, a dialogue that is both verbal and non-verbal ensues. The woman hugs
the caregiver, and the caregiver thanks her. CG: `Are you a little chilly?' PWD: `Yes, I am
sometimes'. CG: `Well, I will have to share my warmth with you'. The woman agrees. It can
be heard in the caregiver's statements when she is chatting with the woman, without receiving
any verbal answers, that the caregiver nonetheless perceives that she is being answered. One
suddenly hears the woman say, in a clear voice: `It's such a pleasure every time you come!' The
caregiver answers: `It's such a pleasure to be here'.
The example describes a prolonged process. Under certain circumstances, the person with
dementia expressed withdrawal from the caregiver, when the caregiver asked intellectual
questions, for example. The caregiver was, however, responsive to the expressions and
changed her strategy, which was interpreted as leading to the establishment of security
68 Dementia 12(1)
and trust. After RT, the person with dementia was asked how it felt, whereupon she
answered with conviction: `It feels lovely!'
Approaching
`Approaching' was a dimension of `Establishing security and trust', which involved the
caregivers first observing the person to determine whether the time was right to approach
or make contact. The categories `Creating an inviting environment' and ``Sense of self-
determination' were significant to approaching the person.
According to the caregivers, one cannot ignore that there are two parties involved in the
approach, but they still felt that the caregiver was mainly responsible for ensuring that the
approach was a positive experience. Caregivers emphasized the importance of personal
commitment to RT, but expressed the opinion that not all caregivers are committed. The
situation could feel uncomfortable for some people, which was thought to depend on the
caregivers' capacity and willingness to approach persons with dementia. Caregivers
interpreted honesty and sincerity as prerequisites to approaching persons with dementia.
CG: . . . I'm sure some people think this is hard, the RT . . . Not everyone is cut out
to . . . neither . . . oh, how should I put it . . . talk or give . . . people are very different. And it has
to be really hard for them . . . After all, it's . . . maybe a little hard for, and . . . . . . you have to let
go . . . and you have to open up too. Even. . . if a person like them [person with dementia] feels
like . . . go out and go for a walk . . . or whatever . . . you feel, well . . . vibes if you don't think it's
fun. So not everyone can do it, I don't think so.
The person with dementia also described the approach as a privilege not all caregivers
were granted.
I: But you can talk to the girls?
PWD: Oh yes, I think so . . .
I: . . . and that's fun?
PWD: Sure, as long as they want to talk to you, but a lot of them don't want to.
Creating an inviting setting. `Creating an inviting setting' had to do with the caregiver's
efforts to make the setting warmer and more welcoming, something interpreted as significant
to approaching the person. Drinks and snacks were usually offered, with the drinks served in
pretty glasses. The person might also be offered coffee, fruit or other sweets. Candles were lit
and the person was sometimes invited to move to a special room decorated in a seashore
theme and with an extra heat source.
VS: `Let's go in here', the caregiver says. `Oh, it's so nice here', the woman exclaims as they enter
the room. `Yes, it's lovely', the caregiver agrees. They each take a seat in armchairs placed close
together. The woman meets the caregiver's eyes, giving what is interpreted as a look of
tenderness and mutual understanding.
The person with dementia gave spontaneous verbal expression of liking the room and was
interpreted as also giving non-verbal expression of feelings of security and trust in the
caregiver by means of, for example, looks of tenderness and mutual understanding.
Sense of self-determination. Instilling a `Sense of self-determination' was part of the
approach, in which the caregiver considered and showed respect for the person's signs or
verbal expressions of willingness or unwillingness to participate in RT. CG: ` . . . it's more
Ericsson et al. 69
like: May I come in and bother you a little bit?' The person was asked what they wanted and
their wishes were respected, and although the activity was suggested by the caregiver, the
suggestion corresponded to the person's wishes, interests and remaining capacities. When the
caregiver asked for the person's permission to disturb them, this was interpreted as helping
the person with dementia feel a sense of self-determination. The persons with dementia also
stated that there were times when they did not want to participate in RT, when for instance
they were not feeling well or felt a need to be alone for a while. Even when they were
unwilling to participate, the perception was that the caregiver respected their wishes.
I: But do you like it when somebody comes to see you like this?
PWD: Oh, yes, of course, it's great fun, but . . . you can't be feeling too bad, because it's no fun
then . . . If you're feeling well . . . but if you . . . feel bad, it's no fun . . . but that's not fun for
anybody.
There were also RT sequences in which the person expressed a desire to stop an ongoing
activity and the caregiver responded immediately, acting in accordance with the person's
wishes.
VS: Right in the middle of the activity, the woman wants to stop and go home. The caregiver
immediately complies with her wishes and shows by her actions that she intends to stop. One can
hear the caregiver trying, calmly and quietly, to allay the woman's anxiety while slowly starting
to wrap up the activity. She does not contradict the woman, but instead offers her dinner which
the woman rejects at first. The caregiver quietly comments that it is raining, which leads the
woman to remark that the rain makes it hard to go outside. The caregiver turns up the volume
on the CD player. It can be interpreted, based on the woman's expression and that she sings
along with the verses, that she likes the music. The caregiver also offers the woman a drink in a
pretty glass and snacks that are on the table. The woman asks where all this came from and the
caregiver tells her that her husband brought it. After a few minutes, the woman expresses
gratitude and looks very contented, sitting there in her armchair.
It was interpreted that the caregiver's rapid response to the person's wish to end the
activity gave the person a sense of self-determination. This in turn seemed to lead to a
sense of security and trust, which was interpreted as contributing to the person changing
her mind about wanting to go home.
The persons with dementia sometimes expressed something also interpreted as a form of
self-determination, which involved yielding decisions to someone else. In the interviews, they
expressed that it was good if the caregiver took the initiative and suggested activities, since
they could not remember and thus were unable to state interests and wishes. They were
interpreted as feeling content, satisfied and secure in yielding decisions to the caregiver. It
sometimes seemed difficult for the persons with dementia to understand what was being
offered them. It was therefore interpreted as essential to participation that the caregiver
suggested the activity while reminding the person of previous occasions when he or she
had been involved in the activity, and that the caregiver prompted the activity.
VS: The caregiver comes into the room and announces that now they are going to talk about old
sayings. The caregiver has to repeat the information because the woman does not hear the first
time, and she adds words when in the repetition, as one usually does. The woman says that she
doesn't know how, but the caregiver encourages her by saying: `Oh my, of course you do, you
did a great job last time'. It seems as if the caregiver is referring to the preceding occasion to help
70 Dementia 12(1)
the woman understand she has done this before and, in so doing, give her the confidence and
courage to agree to the activity. The woman is still hesitant, but the caregiver goes on: `You were
so good at it and it was so much fun last time'. After the caregiver has arranged seating, lit
candles, put on background music and served snacks, she began the activity, which seemed
immediately to appeal to the woman.
The person expressed non-understanding of what was being offered and was therefore
hesitant about participating, but when the activity was eventually started, the person showed
signs of content.
Communicating equality
`Communicating equality' represents the caregiver's various attempts to communicate to the
person with dementia a sense of being an equal. This was interpreted as significant to
encouraging the person to open up and thus make a relationship possible. To help the
person feel like an equal, the caregiver might suggest an activity that involved
cooperation between the parties. Verbal reinforcement of equality between them, and the
use of items with similar exterior attributes were interpreted as conducive to the sense of
equality.
VS: The caregiver suggests that they should put on aprons to bake. She then puts on an apron
before tying an apron around the woman's waist, saying that now they are the same. The woman
and the caregiver observe one another and agree that now they look lovely. Once the cake has,
with their combined efforts, been put in the oven and they have cleaned up the mess together, the
woman remarks that they are `good girls', to which the caregiver immediately agrees with
conviction in her tone.
Conditions for `communicating equality' were interpreted as improved when caregivers
placed herself very close to the person, at the same level and in a position that made eye
contact possible. Caregivers sometimes placed themselves at a slightly lower level. This
placement was interpreted as a deliberate strategy by the caregiver that contributed to the
person's self-perception as an equal.
When the caregiver paid no notice to the person's deficits, this was interpreted as an
effective strategy for encouraging the person to feel like an equal. When the person with
dementia could not manage a task, the caregiver might say: `I couldn't do it either; that was
hard' or `I didn't understand that either'. The caregiver's uniform was mentioned as an
example of something that kept the parties from being entirely equal. CG: `I go in as a
friend. I'm wearing a uniform, but still . . . you are. . . a fellow human being'. Although
caregivers expressed the view that equality could never be perfect they were interpreted as
believing that it was entirely possible for the person with dementia to feel like an equal.
Feeling like a contributor
`Feeling like a contributor' was a dimension of `Communicating equality'. Caregivers
believed that the persons with dementia wanted to participate and that by participating,
they perceived themselves as contributors. CG: `They really want to help or want to feel like
they are a part of things. So, it's not just about you coming up with something to do. They
have to be involved'. The persons with dementia were observed to contribute something,
such as knowledge and life experience, in nearly all RT sequences. They expressed verbally
Ericsson et al. 71
and non-verbally what could be interpreted as pride in having been able to contribute. The
persons with dementia were interpreted as contributing by responding to the caregiver's
friendly actions, for instance. An example of this was the woman who had had her own
nails painted and then, after carefully selecting a nail polish, wanted to paint the caregiver's
nails.
Expressing concern for the caregiver was another way to contribute. For the persons with
dementia, it was interpreted as important to them to reinforce verbal expressions of
appreciation by, for example, touching or hugging the caregiver.
VS: The woman gives the caregiver, who is sitting close to her, what is interpreted as a tender
glance, and asks with a sympathetic tone whether the staff have had a rough day. The caregiver
answers that things have been a little quieter today. The woman turns towards the caregiver and
tries to hug her while saying: `You're not working too hard, are you, darling?' The caregiver
moves away a little, so the woman ends up embracing the caregiver's arm. `Oh no', says the
caregiver, `we get to rest sometimes too'.
In the situation described, however, it can be interpreted that the person's sense of
contribution was stymied when the caregiver was not ready just then to accept the hug.
Opening up
`Opening up' involved the persons with dementia availability for the caregivers' overtures as
a consequence of `Assigning time', `Establishing security and trust' and `Communicating
equality'. Differences in degree of `Opening up' were, however, interpreted to exist between
the various video sequences, which seemed to depend on how well the caregivers succeeded
with their strategies for attaining the intended goal. The person with dementia expressed
awareness of their inability to remember and hold a conversation, but expressed the view
that the one-to-one time (RT) helped them have the courage to try anyway.
PWD: Oh, I like (one-to-one) better . . . than a lot of them . . . then I don't really want to say
anything.
I: These times when you meet one-to-one, how do you feel about those times? How do you feel
then?
PWD: Oh, I get happy, it feels like a relief, and then you get things out that you have inside, you
have the courage to tell other people . . . then you get it out . . .
I: mmm . . . yes, I see . . . And you have the courage to say these things when you are together one-
to-one?
PWD: Yes, I do . . . I trust her completely . . .
I: So, these times are important to you?
PWD: Very [emphasis] important . . .
At the caregiver's prompting, the person often began telling parts of her life story. It
seemed as if trust in the perceived relationship of equals had the effect that even persons
interpreted as having significant language deficits had the courage to talk. There were times
when the narrative was suspended, but this did not seem to worry either party. Calmly and
quietly, the caregiver, usually interpreted as having good knowledge of the person's life
story, suggested a possible continuation of the story. Although her suggestion was not
always right, the person with dementia was observed to continue the story after a brief
pause.
72 Dementia 12(1)
On one occasion when the person with dementia was worried about being able to manage
a step in an activity, the caregiver encouraged the person to try with the words: CG: `Of
course you can, I'm right here'. The person was interpreted as feeling trust that the caregiver
would intervene if necessary and hence had the courage to try the step, and succeeded.
`Opening up' involved reciprocity, which involved the caregivers in also extending trust
and becoming more open. Clear interest could often be observed in the persons with
dementia when caregivers shared something about themselves. PWD: `Yes, and they
might talk about their concerns, and I about mine . . . a dialogue, you know . . . '. It was
interpreted, however, that professionalism was maintained through the process. The
person with dementia expressed the view that the caregiver: ` . . . is very personal without
being nosy . . . it's nice'. The caregivers interpreted this experience of letting go as, for
themselves and the person with dementia, a shared experience, which was interpreted as
reciprocity during the session. I: If I understand you right, you have also felt a sense of calm
during this time? CG:`Oh yes. It . . . gives me as much as it gives the person who gets it [RT].
It actually does'.
Prominent findings
The caregivers created relationships with persons with dementia by initiating and controlling
the process. To make the person with dementia receptive to the caregiver's overtures, the
caregiver first demonstrated that they had time for the person (assigning time), which gave
the person a feeling of significance. It was also important that the caregiver established a
sense of security and trust in the person with dementia. The approach to the person was
important in making this perception possible. To facilitate the approach, an inviting setting
was arranged and efforts were made to help the person feel a sense of self-determination,
including that found in wanting and being permitted to yield decisions. Efforts were also
made so that persons with dementia would perceive themselves as equals; that the persons
felt they were contributing and allowed to contribute was an important aspect here. These
strategies led to the person with dementia to open up, which was the prerequisite for creating
the relationship.
Discussion
Discussion of results
The results showed how relationships with persons with dementia were created in the context
of the Relational Time method. At first glance, the professional caregiver's assignment of
time and guidance of the process in order to create a relationship with the person may be
understood as an example of what Kitwood (1997) and Brooker (2007) describe as malignant
social psychology, which involves exerting power over a person in a position of dependency.
Providing care to persons with dementia is complex and it requires caregivers to be aware of
the risks inherent in the position of power they automatically occupy in relation to the
person who is dependent upon care (Kitwood, 1997). The caregivers' overtures and
guidance of the process were probably necessary due to the functional deficits of the
persons with dementia. Brooker (2007), however, argues that the person's dependency on
the caregiver's overtures, help and support requires constant self-examination by the
caregiver: the caregiver must examine and manage the imbalance of power in order to
avoid infantilizing the person.
Ericsson et al. 73
The person's uncertainty as to whether the professional caregiver had time probably did
not promote creating a relationship and may be one of the main reasons it sometimes took
quite some time for a relationship to be established. Davies & Nolan (2008) state that it takes
time to establish relationships and time is at a premium in modern, pressurized working
environments (Hall & Kiesners, 2005), but some scholars contend that care outcomes are not
solely dependent upon caregiver resources. The professional caregiver's attitudes and
flexibility also play a role (Cohen-Mansfield & Bester, 2006; Kontos & Naglie, 2007), an
opinion shared by the caregivers in this study. It was, however, clear that the persons with
dementia were not unaffected by the constant reminders that time was short, which is
consistent with the understanding that lucidity exists despite far advanced dementia
(Cahill & Diaz-Ponce, 2011; Hughes, 2008; Kontos, 2004). Doubt about whether the
caregivers had time for RT may have been, and could be, the greatest barrier to creating
relationships in the care setting. The core category of `Opening up' was interpreted as that
which Buber (1958) describes as essential to the relationship. Buber (1958) speaks of the
`encounter' in which one is open or available for the other, but also discusses the
vulnerability inherent in opening up to the other, since there is risk of rejection. Rejection
is probably something that occurs relatively often in the day-to-day care setting, since so
many people are in urgent need of the caregivers' attention. Accordingly, assigning time for
RT was most likely significant to creating the relationship, although the most important
thing might have been that caregivers showed through body language that they had the time,
rather than verbally expressing that they had time. These prerequisites are consistent with
that which Buber (1958) identifies as fundamental to the human I and Thou encounter, where
the deep relationship is established ­ the encounter that demands openness, presence,
closeness and interest from both parties (Buber, 1958).
In the one-to-one RT session with the caregiver, the persons with dementia dared to try,
for example, to tell a story even when cognitive capacity was impaired. Occasional errors
were overlooked by caregivers, which was probably a strategy for preventing feelings of
frustration in the persons with dementia. There was, however, a belief that such overlooking
of mistakes might have been perceived as exaggerated. Kitwood (1997) and Brooker (2007)
categorize exaggerated praise as infantilization. There is reason to believe that exaggerated
disregard of things an adult person should normally know about and be capable of might
have been perceived as infantilization. Studies have shown that lucidity is often greater than
what might be expected based on the person's deficits (Ericsson, Malmberg, Langworth,
Haglund, & Almborg, 2011; Hughes, 2008; Kontos & Naglie, 2007; Zingmark, Sandman &
Norberg, 2002).
According to this and earlier studies (Malloy & Hadjistavropoulos, 2004; Nolan, Davies,
Brown, Keady, & Nolan, 2004), a sense of security and trust has proven important to
creating a relationship. A prerequisite for establishing security and trust was that the
persons with dementia had a sense of self-determination, although aspects of the results
indicated that it may be equally important to be allowed to yield decisions to someone
else. The question is whether the sense of self-determination was not more a matter of
having one's wishes respected and not being directly contradicted than of being allowed
to decide things for oneself. Confirmation is always highly significant in caring for persons
with dementia (Edvardsson, Winblad, & Sandman, 2008). The caregiver's efforts with the
woman who wanted to go home, for example, probably led to a greater sense of security and
trust, which was probably more important than actually being able to act on the original
expressed wish to go home. Malloy & Hadjistavropoulos (2004) talk with reference to
74 Dementia 12(1)
Heidegger, about being `transparent', where the caregiver facilitates, rather than prescribing
limits, and provides support when the person's capacities are inadequate or where autonomy
could lead to harm or violation of personhood. Self-determination may not always be the
best or most secure situation. When caregivers were transparent, the persons with dementia
did not notice that it was the caregivers who were `in charge' and therefore felt liberated and
self-determining, in line with Malloy & Hadjistavropoulos (2004).
The professional caregivers and the persons with dementia mentioned that not all
caregivers were willing or able to establish relationships. Kitwood (1997) and Brooker
(2007) posit that caring for persons with dementia demands closeness and warmth and
that closeness is essential to creating a relationship (Buber, 1958). Since the relationship
is considered significant (Davies & Nolan, 2008; McCormack, 2004; Nolan, Davies,
Brown, Keady, & Nolan, 2004), it may be important to consider the relevance of the
perception that not all caregivers have the capacity or sensitivity required to establish
relationships with persons with dementia. It is likely that professional caregivers may
find it difficult to get as close to the person as they need to in order to create a
relationship. Basting (2003) argues that dementia itself can be frightening, often due
to inadequate understanding of the disease. Norbergh, Helin, Dahl, Hellze
´ n, & Asplund
(2006) showed that there was a lack of interaction due to language difficulties. The
persons with dementia communication deficit may explain why one-to-one situations
may feel uncomfortable for caregivers. Kitwood (1997) argues, however, that if
caregivers are given the opportunity to process what engenders feelings of discomfort,
the approach that is so important to establishing a relationship may be made possible.
Research has shown that education and training can improve caregivers' skills at
providing care to persons with dementia (Kontos & Naglie, 2007; McCallion,
Toseland, Lacey, & Banks, 1999;), which might also apply to creating relationships.
Experience working with RT for some time may have helped the caregivers in this
study improve their skills at creating relationships with persons with dementia. The
fact that capacities believed lost often emerge when a relationship has been
established (Normann, Asplund, Karlsson, Sandman, & Norberg, 2006; Zingmark,
Dandman, & Norberg, 2002) may have been the reason that caregivers, who had
thought it not worth the effort to try and approach persons with dementia in such a
way that relationships were established, suddenly discovered that capacities exist that do
make it worthwhile. It is conceivable that such a discovery may have changed the
caregivers' views of both the person and the dementing illness and thus made them
more inclined to prioritize one-to-one interaction, as in RT, which they have learnt by
experience facilitates the creation of relationships.
There is every reason to believe that the sense of well-being perceived during RT was
linked to the relationship that had been created. The person with dementia's deficits,
however, impede the maintenance of the relationship and make it frail and short-lived,
particularly when the person has severe dementia (Malloy & Hadjistavropoulos, 2004;
Penrod et al., 2007). For this reason, it is likely that the deep relationship that engenders
well-being must be recreated in every encounter with the person with dementia. For the
persons with dementia who participated in this study to feel episodes of well-being, it was
probably important that they were given opportunities for the one-to-one interaction offered
in RT. There is, however, always risk that a method like RT, introduced to improve care,
will be performed mechanically and not fulfil the original aim of creating a relationship. This
mechanization would hopefully be revealed when the positive effect of the `encounter'
Ericsson et al. 75
(Buber, 1958) ­ the relationship ­ fails to materialize and thus also the feelings of well-being
expressed by both parties in the study.
Discussion of method
The investigator (IE) was in the field intermittently for two months to perform repeated
videotapings and interviews with persons with dementia. It was important to interview the
persons with dementia on repeated occasions because they were generally fatigued after the
videotaping and unable to maintain focus and concentration on what they had been involved
in, that is, the purpose of the interview. Charmaz (2006) argues that it is important to have a
prolonged engagement in the field (Creswell, 2007) and to perform repeated interviews to
obtain in-depth information (Charmaz, 2006). The interviews were held immediately after
RT in order to capture the person's perceptions of the session. Experiences that trigger
positive or negative feelings may remain in the person's consciousness for some time after
the experience (Engstro
¨ m, Marmsta
° l Hammar, Williams, & Go
¨ tell, 2011). Despite this, there
was risk that the information might be insufficient to achieve saturation in the material
(Charmaz, 2006) because the interviews were brief. This was compensated for by means
of the repeated interviews. The briefer interviews often yielded more concentrated
information than the longer interviews, in which the person with dementia's concentration
on the subject successively waned.
Both authors (IE and IH) who conducted the interviews have experience of working with,
and interviewing persons with dementia and caregivers. Various stages of dementia and the
difficulties several persons with dementia had expressing themselves clearly in words required
follow-up questions to verify what the person was perceived to be saying both verbally and
non-verbally, since the risk of over-interpretation is always present. The capacity to express
oneself in words may be lost while the capacity to understand may be intact (Hughes, 2008),
which makes it possible to verify the information given (Ericsson, Aronsson, Cedersund,
Hugoson, Jonsson, & Wa
¨ rnberg Gerdin, 2009). There was also risk of posing leading
questions, but it was significant that the questions were direct, short and concrete due to
the diminished capacity for abstract thinking common in dementia (Allan & Killick, 2008).
The investigators (IE, IH) had a preunderstanding that could increase the risk of over-
interpretation. The co-author (SK) did not participate in data collection and had no previous
experience in the field of study and thus acted as a peer debriefer (Creswell, 2007), which is
considered to reduce the risk of over-interpretation. Pre-understanding is, however, not only
a drawback, as it also facilitates notice and identification of important information that
might otherwise have been missed (Charmaz, 2006). The interviews with caregivers were
conducted by co-author IH, who had no experience of RT, which was thought to reduce the
risk of experience-based influence on how questions were asked and that respondents might
give the answers they believed were expected (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Triangulation
(Charmaz, 2006; Creswell, 2007) was applied to further enhance reliability through the
involvement of all authors in the analysis, the use of multiple sources of data and several
interviewers.
Conclusion
Caregivers can establish relationships with persons with moderate to severe dementia.
The most important factors in creating relationships are: that the caregiver takes the
76 Dementia 12(1)
initiative and demonstrates that time is available; that the person with dementia feels a sense
of security and trust and feels like an equal, and thus dares to open up to a relationship. In a
simple and straightforward way, the results of this study give caregivers an understanding of
the factors that influence how relationships with persons with dementia are established. It is
likely that creating relationships may also be a path to understanding the practical
application of person-centred care. When a relationship has been established with the
person with dementia, caregivers are given the response so sorely needed to feel that their
work is meaningful, while persons with dementia feel a sense of well-being through the
confirmation of their personhood.
Greater awareness of the significance of relationships in caring for persons with dementia
is needed in organizations and among caregivers. Understanding needs to be increased that
small measures, such as the RT method, that do not require significant resources can open
paths to attaining the goal of creating relationships with persons with dementia to enhance
their sense of well-being.
