Low levels of perceived social integration, or loneliness,
are associated with increased risk for a range of poor
health outcomes, including depression [1], elevated vas-
cular resistance [2], poor sleep [3], and early death [4].
Despite the fact that epidemiological literature linking
objective and perceived social integration with health is
quite large, questions about causality remain (cf. [5, 6]).
Is it the case that loneliness exerts a negative effect on
health, or are these associations due to third variables,
including genetic factors common to both loneliness and
poor health?
Behavior genetic methods are ideal for answering this
type of question [7­9]. Cotwin control studies, for exam-
ple, can be used to determine whether twins who are
discordant for phenotypic exposure (e.g., divorce) dem-
onstrate differences in an outcome (e.g., depression) after
shared genetic influences-- that are common to both the
exposure and outcome variables-- are taken into account.
A comparison of the genetic relatedness of monozygotic
(MZ) twins, who share 100% of their genes and their rear-
ing environment, and dizygotic (DZ) twins, who share 50%
of their genes and 100% of their rearing environment, can
be used to formalize a biometric model for examining the
potential causal association between two variables.1 In
twin methodology, these differences between MZ and DZ
twins are used in structural equation modeling to decom-
pose the variance in a trait or phenotype into additive
genetic effects (A), common environmental effects (C),
and unique or nonshared environmental influences (E);
together, this decomposition yields an "ACE" model that
can be used to derive the heritability of a phenotype (i.e.,
the percentage of variance that is due to additive genetics
(A), the environmental influences that are shared between
ORIGINAL RESEARCH REPORT
Social Integration and Sleep Disturbance:
A Gene-Environment Interaction Study
David A. Sbarra*
Objective: Low levels of perceived social integration, or loneliness, are associated with increased risk
for a range of poor health outcomes. Sleep disturbance plays a central role in the evolutionary theory of
loneliness, which provides a mechanistic account of how low levels of social integration may negatively
impact health. No studies, however, have examined whether the association between social integration
and sleep disturbance is consistent with a causal effect after accounting for genes that are common to
both variables.
Method: Using twin data (N = 905 twin pairs) from the nationally-representative Midlife in the United
States (MIDUS) survey, I evaluated a series of bivariate twin models exploring whether the phenotypic asso-
ciation between low social integration and sleep disturbance can be explained by shared genetics. In addi-
tion, the current study specified a series of quantitative models for studying gene x environment (G X E)
interactions to determine whether the genetic and environmental influences on sleep disturbance differ
as a function of social integration.
Results: The phenotypic association between social integration and sleep disturbance was fully accounted
for by genes that are common between the two variables, suggesting that within-twin pair differences
in social integration do not exert a causal influence on sleep disturbance. Social integration, however,
moderated the non-shared environmental influence on sleep disturbances, with the greatest environmental
influences observed at the lowest levels of social integration.
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that an essential feature of the evolutionary model of
loneliness may need refinement or elaboration. The moderation findings are discussed in terms of the fit
with a stress-buffering model of social support in which environmental influences on sleep disturbance are
strongest when social resources are low.

twins in a family (C), and those that are unique to each
twin (E, which also includes measurement error).
In a bivariate specification, this ACE model allows us
to examine whether within-pair differences in a predic-
tor variable--for example, loneliness--are associated with
differences in an outcome of interest. Using twin data
from the nationally-representative Midlife in the United
States (MIDUS) study, for example, Fujiwara and Kawachi
[6] found the associations among perceived social inte-
gration and perceived physical or mental health were
not consistent with a direct causal influence from social
integration to either of the (self-reported) outcomes. This
finding suggests that reducing loneliness (or, improving
social integration) would not lead to improvements in
self-rated physical or mental health; conceptually, another
way of understanding these findings would be to consider
a hypothetical twin pair: Twin A's loneliness would predict
Twin B's health just as well as Twin B's loneliness, and this
type of effect is not consistent with a causal effect from
loneliness to health. Using twin models to interrogate
questions of causality has direct implications for interven-
tion science. If treatment and other public health efforts
attempt to alter loneliness in order to improve or promote
health (cf. [10]), this work should proceed by targeting
potential mechanisms of action that are consistent with
a causal link from loneliness to an outcome of interest. In
this respect, the twin models I report on in this paper are
a useful tool for identifying these potentially causal links
and, perhaps more importantly, may be used to determine
that the association between loneliness or social inte-
gration and another variable is inconsistent with a direct
causal effect.
The current report extends this prior analysis in two
ways. First, although Fujiwara and Kawachi [6] found no
evidence for a causal link between perceived social inte-
gration and health, it is plausible that the epidemiologi-
cal association exists via indirect effects, with loneliness
exerting a causal influence an intermediate variable,
which then exerts a causal effect on a health outcome
of interest (i.e., the direct association between loneliness
and health may not be causal, but loneliness may exert a
causal effect on an intermediate variable that is causally
related to a health outcome). From this perspective, sleep
quality is an important candidate intermediate variable.
Not only are sleep disturbances associated with a range
of morbidities and risk for early death [11], but sleep
plays an important role in the evolutionary theory of
loneliness [12, 13]. The theory holds that over the course
of evolutionary history being on the social periphery
increased the likelihood of predation; loneliness func-
tions in part as a social alarm system alerting people to
their status within a group and the need to reconnect
with others for safety. Although it is adaptive for lonely
people to maintain vigilance for signs of environmental
threat, over time this vigilance comes with a negative
cost to one's health (cf. [14]).
Within this framework, sleep disturbances are an
expectable form of hypervigilance, and many stud-
ies find that lonely people evidence considerable sleep
difficulties, ranging from reports of daytime fatigue [3, 15]
to objectively measured sleep fragmentation [16].
Importantly, recent genetically-informed studies reveal
that the associations between sleep duration and both
body mass and depressed mood are consistent with a
causal influence from sleep to these outcomes of inter-
est [17, 18]. Given the importance of sleep for understand-
ing the evolutionary significance of the loneliness-health
association, I examine the potential etiology of the asso-
ciation between perceived social integration and self-
reported sleep disturbances using data from the MIDUS
twin sample. The main goal of this paper is to investigate
whether within-pair differences in social integration (i.e.,
when one twin reports being more socially integrated
than his or her cotwin) are associated with sleep distur-
bances once genetic influences that are common to both
variables are taken into account.
The main analytic strategy of this paper is to examine
whether social integration is associated with sleep distur-
bance in a manner consistent with a causal explanation;
however, another way to explore the association between
these variables is to conceptualize social integration as an
"environmental context" that can shape the genetic and
environmental influences on sleep disturbance (cf. [19]).
To understand social integration as an environmental con-
text, I offer two competing hypotheses. First, consistent
with a general diathesis-stress model, the genetic contri-
butions to sleep disturbance may be strongest at low lev-
els of self-reported social integration (i.e., high loneliness).
In this case, low social integration would provide a con-
text for revealing genetic liabilities to sleep disturbance.
Alternatively, consistent with a stress-buffering model of
social support (see [20, 21]), environmental influences on
sleep disturbance may be strongest at the lowest levels of
social integration. In this case, low levels of social integra-
tion would provide a context in which the environmental
influences on sleep disturbance are the strongest; alter-
natively, a putatively positive environmental context (i.e.,
high social integration) would protect against stressful
environmental influences on sleep disturbance.
Testing these competing ideas involves incorporating
a statistical interaction into the standard biometric twin
model to determine whether the genetic and environ-
mental influences on sleep disturbance differ as a func-
tion of social integration. Biometric moderation analyses
[22] are receiving increased attention in psychological
science [18, 19, 23, 24, 25], and this approach allows
researchers to study quantitative gene-environment
interaction(s) in the context of gene-environment cor-
relation (i.e., in situations where common genetics can
explain part of the association between predictor and
outcome variables). This approach holds promise for
expanding the evolutionary theory of loneliness. If low
levels of perceived social integration increase the genetic
contribution to sleep disturbance, we observe another
route through which loneliness, as an environmental
exposure (highly heritable in-and-of itself, see [26]) may
shape the genetic contributions to an important health-
relevant variable like sleep.

The Present Study
Using the twin subsample from the MIDUS study, this
paper investigated two primary research questions.
First, consistent with a quasi-causal association (see [9]),
I expected the non-shared environmental component of
social integration to be significantly associated with sleep
disturbances after accounting for genetic influences that
are common to both low social integration and high lev-
els of sleep disturbance. Second, in the context of this
environmental main effect, I also explored the possibility
that social integration moderates the genetic and envi-
ronmental influences on sleep disturbance; regarding
these moderation analyses, I did not have a strong a priori
hypothesis. On one hand, consistent with a diathesis-
stress model, the largest heritability in sleep disturbance
may be observed among people who report low levels of
social integration. On the other hand, consistent with a
stress-buffering model, the environmental influences--
the so-called slings and arrows of life--may exert their
strongest influences on sleep disturbance when perceived
social integration is low. Thus, the moderation analyses
were largely exploratory, but they were informed by these
competing ideas about how social integration may differ-
entially shape the genetic and environmental influences
on sleep disturbance.
Method
Participants
Participants contributing to the current analyses were
part of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey
twin sample. The MIDUS survey is a nationally representa-
tive random-digit-dial sample of noninstitutionalized,
English-speaking adults aged 25­74 in the United States;
the first wave of the MIDUS survey included 7,108 par-
ticipants (3,395 men) who were an average age of 46.40
years old (SD = 13 years) when the initial phone interview
was conducted in 1995­1996. The twin sample consists
of 921 pairs. As reported in detail elsewhere (e.g., [24]),
zygosity was assessed via self-report using questions about
eye and hair color, as well as the degree to which people
were confused as to the twin's identity in childhood. This
approach is valid and widely used [27], but 16 of the
MIDUS twin pairs were deemed to have indeterminate
zygosity and were excluded from the present analysis. The
final sample included 905 pairs (1,810 total participants):
162 male monozygotic (MZ) pairs, 186 female MZ pairs,
124 male dizygotic (DZ) pairs, and 197 female DZ pairs,
and 236 opposite sex DZ pairs. The average age of the
sample was 44.7 years (SD = 12.12 years, range 25­74). All
participants provided informed consent, and the MIDUS
study was approved by the institutional review boards at
each data collection site. The author's local institutional
review board does not consider de-identified secondary
data analysis to be human subjects research.
Measures
Social integration. Social integration was assessed as
part of the MIDUS survey's self-administered question-
naire. Three items, scored on a 7-point Likert-type scale
from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree," were used
to compute a composite index. The items tapping percep-
tions of social integration were as follows: "I don't feel I
belong to anything I'd call a community," "I feel close to
other people in my community," and, "My community is a
source of comfort." The composite index was scaled such
that high scores reflected a greater sense of social integra-
tion. The scale has adequate internal consistency ( = .73)
and has demonstrated construct validity [28, 29].
Sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance was assessed
with a single item in the self-administered questionnaire:
"During the past 30 days, how often have you experienced
trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?" The sleep dis-
turbance item was scored on a 6-point Likert-type scale
from "Almost every day" to "Not at all." For the present
study, the items were reverse-scored with higher scores
reflecting greater sleep disturbance. The mean sleep dis-
turbance score was 2.34 (SD = 1.67, range 1­6), indicating
that, on average, the participants in this study reported
sleep disturbances slightly more one time in the past 30
days. Single item assessments are not the most valid meas-
ures of self-reported sleep disturbance; the most well-val-
idated self-report measure in this area is the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; [30]). Although the original
MIDUS Survey (used in this report) did not include the
PSQI, the MIDUS Biomarker Project, completed roughly
10 years after the original MIDUS Survey, included the
PSQI. The single item sleep disturbance measure (used in
this report) from the MIDUS survey was correlated r = .37
(n = 968, p < .001) with the PSQI Global Sleep Quality, a
measure of overall sleep quality in the prior month, in the
Biomarker Project. This test-retest stability over a 10-year
period suggests the sleep disturbance item used in this
sample is reliable and correlated with the gold-standard
assessment for self-reported sleep disturbance up to a dec-
ade later.
Data Analysis
All data and computer codes associated with this paper
are available online at the Open Science Framework por-
tal and can be accessed at the following hyperlink: osf.
io/utqrz. I analyzed the data beginning first with a bio-
metric structural equation model (using Mplus, [31]) that
examined the potential quasi-causal association between
social integration and sleep disturbance. The model is
described in detail elsewhere (see [9]) but its essential
feature involves making use of the twin methodology
to decompose the genetic and environmental influences
that are common between the two variables. Following
standard conventions for these models, I first residualized
the social integration and sleep variables for both age and
sex, then standardized the residual variables for use in the
biometric models. I estimated how much of the variance
in each trait is due to additive genetic influences (A), com-
mon environmental influences (C), and unique environ-
mental influences (E). This bivariate ACE specification is
shown in Figure 1. The ACE variance components were
standardized and the paths from the components to the
phenotypes were estimated; the specification outlined in
Sbarra: Genetics, Social Integration & Sleep
Art.3, page 4 of 10
Figure 1 decomposes the variance of each variable into
the ACE components and examines the variance shared
between the two variables. To examine the potential quasi-
causal effect, I regressed the sleep disturbance item on the
ACE components of social integration. The key parameter
of interest in this analysis is the regression of the sleep dis-
turbance item on the E component of social integration
after accounting for genetic influences that are common
to the two phenotypes.
The second set of analyses focused on the potential mod-
eration of the genetic components of sleep disturbance as
a function of social integration. This biometric modera-
tion [23] involves extending the bivariate twin model to
include an interaction term as illustrated in Figure 2. This
extension allows the cross-paths and residual genetic and
environmental influences on sleep disturbance to vary
as a function of social integration. I examined goodness
of fit using the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA; [32]), where values below .05 are considered a
close fit and values up to .08 represent reasonable approx-
imations of the data. I also reported the comparative fit
index (CFI; [33]), where values of .95­1.0 indicate a good
fit, as well as the likelihood-ratio test (distributed as a 2
and calculated as the difference in the ­2 log-likelihood
values between the two models), which can be used to test
differences between nested models that add or remove
specific parameters.
Results
Perceived social integration was negatively associated
with self-reported sleep disturbances (r = -.14, 95% CI
[-.24, -.09]). The within-trait and cross-trait twin corre-
lations for social integration and sleep disturbance are
presented in Table 1. As shown, the substantially larger
MZ than DZ within-trait, cross-twin correlations are con-
sistent with a genetic contribution to the variance in both

social integration and sleep disturbance; in addition, for
both variables, the within-trait, cross-twin correlations
for DZ twins is less than half that of MZ twins, suggest-
ing little shared environmental influence on either phe-
notype. The cross-trait, cross-twin correlations, however,
approximate the individual-level phenotypic correlation
presented above, which suggests that the genetic influ-
ences on social integration may account for the associa-
tion between social integration and sleep disturbance.
This possibility was tested formally with the bivariate
model displayed in Figure 1.
Model 1 (Table 2) includes the model parameters for
the full bivariate specification estimating the ACE vari-
ance components for social integration and sleep distur-
bance, as well as regressions from each of the variance
components in social integration to sleep disturbance.
This model fit the data well (CFI = .96, RMSEA = .02). As
shown, estimates for a common environmental influence
(C) on both variables did not appear to be different from
zero. In addition, cross-regressions from the common
environment and the non-shared environment variance in
social integration to sleep disturbance did not appear to
be different from zero. Therefore, I tested a parsimonious
specification (Model 2) by fixing these four parameters to
zero. This specification did not significantly decrease the
model fit (2 = .30, df = 4, p = .99). I confirmed that it
was reasonable to set the common environment to zero
in univariate biometric models for social integration and
sleep disturbance. For each construct, altering the model
from an ACE to an AE specification did not significantly
degrade model fit.
A notable feature of Model 2 is that fixing the cross-
regression from the non-shared environmental variance
of social integration on sleep disturbance to zero did not
result in a decrement in model fit. It is informative to con-
sider these associations from a different perspective as

is fixed to zero and the cross regression from the non-
shared environmental variance is freely estimated? When
the common genetic path is omitted from the model, the
effect of non-shared environment variance in social
integration on sleep disturbance is different from zero
(B = ­.13, SE = .03, 95% [CI ­.18, ­.07]), which is consist-
ent with findings from research that is not genetically
informed. However, fixing the genetic influences (shared
between social integration and sleep disturbance) to
zero resulted in a large decrement in model fit (2 = 23.8,
df = 1, p < .0001). This pattern of results suggests that
within-twin differences in social integration do not exert
a causal influence on sleep disturbance. Instead, evidence
from the MIDUS sample suggests that common genetics
cannot be excluded from the model; the negative pheno-
typic association between perceived social integration and
perceived sleep disturbance is best explained by genes
that are common to both variables.
The next series of analyses explored the possibility that
perceived social integration moderates the genetic and
environmental influences on sleep disturbance. These
models involve adding an interaction term to the AE
variance estimates in the sleep disturbance variable (see
Figure 2), as well as to the cross-regression from social
integration to sleep disturbance. Model 3 (Table 2) dis-
plays the 10 parameter estimates from this moderation
model. Although Model 2 fixed the cross-regression from
the non-shared variance in social integration to sleep dis-
turbance to zero, I estimated this main effect in order to
also estimate the interaction on this cross-regression in
Model 3; conceptually, this would allow for a potentially
causal influence from social integration to sleep distur-
bance to operate at specific levels of social integration.
However, as shown in Table 2 (Model 3), neither the main
effect nor the interaction effects were significant from the
non-shared variance in social integration to sleep distur-
bance. Among the three other interaction effects, social
integration moderated only the unique non-shared envi-
ronmental variance of sleep disturbance. To ensure these
results were not spurious, I re-estimated the model by fix-
ing the non-significant estimates to zero, and the resulting
estimates are displayed in the Model 4. The key param-
eter of interest in Model 4 is the negative interaction (E'
sl
)
between the non-shared variance in sleep disturbance and
social integration, providing evidence that social integra-
tion moderates the unique environmental influences in
sleep disturbance.
The results of this analysis (Model 4) are displayed in
Figure 3. At low levels of social integration, non-shared
environmental contribution to sleep disturbance is high-
est, whereas the influence of genetics on sleep disturbance
increases steadily as social integration increases. For exam-
ple, among people who report the lowest levels of social
integration (i.e., those two SDs below the mean on this
composite), 83% of the variance in sleep disturbance is
due to non-shared environment variance, whereas among
those who report the highest levels of social integration
(i.e., those two SDs above the mean on this composite),
70% of the variance in sleep disturbance is due to non-
shared environmental influence.

Discussion
The results of this study suggest that an essential feature
of the evolutionary model of loneliness may need refine-
ment or elaboration. Contrary to my primary hypothesis
and the hypervigilance formulation, which holds that low
levels of social integration lead to sleep disturbances (for
people who are frequently monitoring their social stand-
ing), I found no evidence for a quasi-causal effect linking
the two constructs. Instead, genes common to both vari-
ables explain the phenotypic association between social
integration and sleep disturbance. These findings are con-
sistent with a prior twin analysis from the MIDUS data,
which found that the association between social integra-
tion and perceived overall (self-rated) health was due to
genetic influences common to both variables [6].
Both social integration and sleep disturbance are com-
plex traits that likely involve contributions from hundreds
of different genes. Although these analyses do not identify
the specific genes that are shared by the two traits, recent
molecular studies suggest that variability in the polymor-
phic region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR)
plays an important role in shaping emotional responses to
stress [34] and is related to both loneliness and a variety of
sleep disturbances [28, 35]. For example, relative to non-
caregivers, caregivers of a spouse or parent with dementia
who also carried a short copy of the serotonin transporter
gene self-reported significantly worse sleep [36], and ado-
lescents carrying the short allele of 5-HTTLPR who also
reported low maternal support were at increased risk of
developing loneliness [37]. Although the serotonin trans-
porter gene may account for some of the shared genetics
in social integration and loneliness, many other genes will
play a role in this association as well; for this reason, this
topic would greatly benefit from further research.
In a series of biometric moderation analyses, I examined
whether the genetic or environmental influences on sleep
disturbance differed as a function of social integration.
Effectively, the analyses constituted studying a potential
quantitative G X E interaction in the context of a gene-
environment correlation (that accounts for genetic influ-
ences that are common to both variables). Although I had
no a priori hypotheses for these analyses, I was motivated
to explore two competing possibilities: a diathesis-stress
model (in which low levels of social integration were asso-
ciated with the largest genetic influences on sleep distur-
bance) and a stress-buffering model (in which low levels of
social integration were associated with the greatest envi-
ronmental influences on sleep disturbance). The modera-
tion analyses revealed that social integration interacted
with the non-shared environmental influences on sleep
disturbance but was largely unassociated with the genetic
influences (either those common to social integration or
unique to sleep disturbance). Thus, the results are most
consistent with a stress-buffering model of social support.
At the lowest levels of social integration (i.e., highest levels
of loneliness), non-shared environmental influences on
sleep disturbance were the greatest, accounting for up to
83% of the variance in sleep disturbance (calculated from
the unstandardized regression coefficients in Model 4,
Table 2). Prior reports demonstrate a large non-shared
environmental influence on sleep duration [18], and the
current results are consistent with this finding, on average,
and further suggest that as social integration decreases,
the influence of non-shared environmental factors grows.
The main idea behind the stress-buffering hypothesis
[20] is that during periods of acute stress, social resources
come online to alter the perception or experience of stress
and thus attenuate the corresponding physiological and
psychological responses to these events. Results of the
current study suggest that when perceived social integra-
tion is low (i.e., when loneliness is high), non-shared envi-
ronmental influences account for the largest amount of
variance in sleep disturbances. These environmental influ-
ences are not shared within the family and may include,
for example, differential exposure by twins to work or
relationship stress, discrimination, academic rejections,
or a host of other environmental experiences that may
be related to sleep disturbance. When social integration
is low, these non-shared experiences exert their strongest
impact on sleep disturbance. In contrast, I find no sub-
stantial evidence in support of the diathesis-stress model
in which we would expect the greatest genetic influences
on sleep disturbances at low levels of social integration.
Although it is true-- and perhaps somewhat perplexing
at face value-- that the largest genetic influences on sleep
disturbance risk are observed at high levels of social inte-
gration, it is important to note that the 29% heritability
observed at high levels of social integration are consistent
with the heritability of low sleep duration in general (see
[18]). I interpret the results to suggest that as social inte-
gration decreases (or, as loneliness increases) we observe a
greater influence of the unique environmental influences
on sleep disturbance. In considering this process overall,
it is also important to note the moderation effect appears
fairly small--a 13% increase in environmental variance
across the entire spectrum of social integration. It will be
incumbent upon future research to ultimately determine
if a change in this amount is meaningful, and one way
of doing so is to examine other moderators of sleep dis-
turbance and to compare or benchmark the differential
genetic and environmental influences across these poten-
tially distinct moderators.
The findings from this study should be interpreted in
light of several limitations. First, a single item tapping
sleep disturbance is inadequate for making firm conclu-
sions about the loneliness-sleep association more gener-
ally. As noted in the Method, however, the single item
measure of sleep disturbance used here was significantly
associated with the PSQI Global Sleep Quality score up to
10yearslater,suggestingthatthesingleitemtappingsleep
problems is sensitive to variability in self-reported sleep
problems. A related point is that both measures used in
this study rely exclusively on self-report, which may con-
found the nature of the genetic association. For example,
it is possible that the common genetic influences on both
traits reflect common method variance and genetic influ-
ences on the tendency to report low levels of social inte-
gration and high sleep disturbance. Genetically-informed
studies that include objective measures of both traits will
help clarify this. Second, this report relied on data from
Sbarra: Genetics, Social Integration & Sleep
Art.3, page 8 of 10
a single wave of the MIDUS study; it is possible that, as
exposure to loneliness accumulates in time, a prospective
association between these traits would be consistent with
a quasi-causal influence. Prospective analyses will add
much to this literature in time. In addition, it is quite pos-
sible that the potentially causal ordering of the associa-
tion between social integration and sleep flows from sleep
to social integration (and not as studied here, from social
integration to sleep). I chose the current analyses based
on extant theory about loneliness and health (see [13]),
but other genetically-informed designs have included
sleep as the predictor variable of interest (e.g., [19]).
Finally, although this study includes 905 twin pairs, the
sample size is relatively small for testing complex biom-
etric models, especially in cases where common environ-
mental influence may be present and for the examination
of statistical interactions. Examining these effects in larger
twin samples would contribute to this growing body of
knowledge.
Conclusion
Sleep and sleep disturbances play an important role in
the evolutionary theory of loneliness [13], but is loneli-
ness a causal agent of ill health or a marker of risk more
generally? The theory dictates that the lonely are hyper-
vigilant about their social standing; this hypervigilance
can extend to sleep difficulties, and these difficulties rep-
resent an important route through which loneliness may
affect health. Using data from the MIDUS twin sample,
this paper examined whether within-pair differences in
social integration were associated with sleep disturbances
after accounting for shared genetic influences on both
traits. The phenotypic association between social integra-
tion and sleep disturbance is best explained by genes that
are common to both variables, and the observed results
were not consistent with a quasi-causal effect from low
social integration to greater sleep disturbances. Despite
the absence of this direct effect, social integration mod-
erated the non-shared environmental influences on sleep
disturbance, with the greatest non-shared environment
variance observed at the lowest levels of sleep distur-
bance. I interpreted these effects as being consistent with
and providing evidence for a stress-buffering model of
social integration rather than a diathesis-stress model in
which low social integration would potentiate the genetic
influences on sleep disturbance.

Notes
1 This effect is often referred to as quasi-causal because
causality cannot be determined without experimenta-
tion (see Turkheimer & Harden, 2014). The presence
of a meaningful association between the two variables
is consistent with a causal process, but this cannot be
determined with certainty. However, if the association
of interest is eliminated after accounting for genes
that are common to both variables, we can determine
with a high degree of certainty that the putative effect
of X on Y is inconsistent with a direct causal effect.
