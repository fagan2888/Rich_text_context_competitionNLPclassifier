Physical functioning is a core element of
health-related quality of life and pre-
dicts further functional decline, mor-
bidity, health services use, and death (1­6).
For example, compared with unimpaired
individuals, people with impaired mobility
have a 2-fold increased risk of falling,
institutionalization, and death and 4­5
times the risk of functional dependence
(4­6). Diabetes may increase the risk of
disability because of its wide-ranging com-
plications, including cardiovascular and
peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and
peripheral neuropathy (7,8). Few studies,
however, have examined the prevalence of
physical disability associated with diabetes
in the U.S. (7,9,10).
Nearly one-fifth of U.S. adults 60
years of age have diabetes, and some
reports have predicted that older individu-
als will comprise two-thirds of the diabetic
population in developed countries by the
year 2025 (11,12). Thus, clarifying the
contribution of diabetes to disability in
older populations is important. This study
estimates the physical disability burden
associated with diabetes in a nationally rep-
resentative sample of older U.S. adults. A
secondary objective is to examine the
degree to which diabetes-related comor-
bidities account for the relationship
between diabetes and physical disability.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study design and population
We analyzed data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), which was a nationally rep-
resentative cross-sectional study of U.S.
civilian noninstitutionalized individuals that
was conducted from 1988 to 1994 (11,13).
We analyzed data on 6,588 individuals 60
years of age who completed a household
interview (3,475 women and 3,113 men) at
which history of diabetes, health status, and
physical disability data were collected. The
response rate among individuals 60 years
of age was 78% (13). Of these participants,
5,718 (87%) received a physical examina-
tion, which included anthropometric and
physical function measurements. Atten-
dance at the physical examination did not
vary according to diabetes status. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants,
and the protocol was approved by the insti-
tutional review board of the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics.
Assessment of diabetes and physical
functioning
Participants were asked whether a physi-
cian had ever told them they had diabetes
(except during pregnancy), were asked
their age at diagnosis, and were asked
about their use of diabetes medications.
Physical functioning was assessed by self-
reported degree of difficulty (none, some
difficulty, much difficulty, inability) in
walking one-fourth of a mile, climbing 10
steps without rest, or doing housework
(e.g., vacuuming, sweeping, dusting, or
tidying up). Participants were also asked
about their frequency of falls during the
past year.

Diabetes and Physical Disability Among
Older U.S. Adults
O R I G I N A L A R T I C L E
OBJECTIVE -- To estimate the prevalence of physical disability associated with diabetes
among U.S. adults 60 years of age.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data from a nationally repre-
sentative sample of 6,588 community-dwelling men and women 60 years of age who par-
ticipated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Diabetes and
comorbidities (coronary heart disease, intermittent claudication, stroke, arthritis, and visual
impairment) were assessed by questionnaire. Physical disability was assessed by self-reported
ability to walk one-fourth of a mile, climb 10 steps, and do housework. Walking speed, lower-
extremity function, and balance were assessed using physical performance tests.
RESULTS -- Among subjects 60 years of age with diabetes, 32% of women and 15% of
men reported an inability to walk one-fourth of a mile, climb stairs, or do housework compared
with 14% of women and 8% of men without diabetes. Diabetes was associated with a 2- to 3-
fold increased odds of not being able to do each task among both men and women and up to
a 3.6-fold increased risk of not being able to do all 3 tasks. Among women, diabetes was also
associated with slower walking speed, inferior lower-extremity function, decreased balance, and
an increased risk of falling. Of the 5 million U.S. adults 60 years of age with diabetes, 1.2
million are unable to do major physical tasks.
CONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes is associated with a major burden of physical disability in
older U.S. adults, and these disabilities are likely to substantially impair their quality of life.

Three tests of physical performance
(walking speed, chair stands, and tandem
stand) were assessed at the physical exam-
ination using a standardized protocol
(6,13,14). Walking speed (in meters per
second) was measured as the mean of 2 tri-
als over an 8-foot course. Lower-extremity
function was measured using the time to
complete 5 stands (in seconds) from an
armless chair 50-cm tall. Balance was mea-
sured using a tandem stand, which mea-
sures the number of seconds (maximum =
10) that the participant can stand with 1
foot directly in front of the other. Among
attendees at the physical examination, 464
(8.1%), 421 (7.4%), and 520 (9.1%) sub-
jects on the walking speed, chair stands,
and tandem stand tasks, respectively,
refused or had incomplete data. The pro-
portion refusing or having incomplete data
did not vary according to diabetes status or
sex (2% difference for all tests and
sexes). Another 201 (3.5%), 481 (8.4%),
and 518 (9.1%) subjects on the walking
speed, chair stand, and tandem stand
tasks, respectively, were unable to perform
the tests because of physical limitations
and were categorized in the poor perfor-
mance group for statistical analyses.
Covariates
Age, ethnicity, education, and smoking were
assessed by questionnaire. Height and weight
were measured with a standard protocol and
were used to calculate BMI (in kilograms
per meters squared). Self-reported weight
and height were used to compute BMI for
subjects without physical measurements (n =
909, 14%). Participants were asked about
their history of heart attack, congestive heart
failure, stroke, cancer, arthritis, or hip frac-
ture. Angina and intermittent claudication
were assessed using the Rose Questionnaire
(15). Visual impairment was defined as diffi-
culty seeing with 1 or both eyes (even when
wearing corrective lenses).
Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted using SUDAAN
to obtain estimates representative of the
community-dwelling U.S. population 60
years of age (16). Our primary analyses esti-
mated the prevalence (crude and age- and
duration-specific prevalence) of levels of dis-
ability (none, some difficulty, much diffi-
culty, inability) in walking one-fourth of a
mile, climbing 10 steps without rest, and
doing housework among participants with
and without self-reported diabetes.
We used multiple polytomous logisti-
cal regression to estimate the association
between diabetes and disability level while
controlling for age, ethnicity, education,
and BMI (17). Ordinary multiple logistical
regression was used to estimate associa-
tions among diabetes and falls, injurious
falls, and poor performance (defined as
inability or performance in the lowest quar-
tile) on walking speed, chair stands, and
tandem stand tasks. For polytomous
regression, both cumulative (proportional
odds) and generalized (multinomial) logit
models were evaluated. Cumulative logit
models provide a single estimate of the
odds ratio (OR), assuming that the associ-
ation between the exposure (diabetes sta-
tus) and the outcome (disability) is
constant at all levels of the outcome vari-
able. The generalized logit estimates sepa-
rate diabetes ORs for each level of disability.
Coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke,
poor vision, intermittent claudication, and
arthritis were added separately to the base
models to evaluate their contribution to
associations between diabetes and disabil-
ity. Finally, we evaluated the association of
diabetes with disability while controlling
simultaneously for all measured diabetes-
related comorbidities.
RESULTS -- The estimated prevalence
of self-reported diabetes was 13.1% among
women and 12.4% among men. Among
subjects with diabetes, 23% of men and
23% of women were taking no diabetic
medications, 48% of men and 43% of
women were taking oral antidiabetic med-
ications but not insulin, and 29% of men
and 34% of women were taking insulin.
People with diabetes had higher BMIs and
were more likely to be nonwhite and to
report fair or poor health, cardiovascular
diseases, and visual impairment than indi-
viduals without diabetes (Table 1). Women
with diabetes were also less educated, were
more likely to have angina and arthritis,
and were less likely to have had cancer than
women without diabetes. Men with dia-
betes were less likely to be smokers than
men without diabetes. Differences in BMI,

Diabetes and physical disability
self-rated health, cardiovascular diseases,
and visual impairment according to dia-
betes status were generally greater in
women than in men.
Diabetes and self-reported physical
disability
Prevalence of self-reported physical disability
on each of the 3 physical function tasks was
markedly higher among both women and
men with diabetes than among individuals
without diabetes (Table 2). A total of 63%
(95% CI 56­71) of diabetic women and
39% (32­47) of diabetic men reported some
disability on at least 1 of the physical tasks
compared with 42% (39­44) and 25%
(23­28) of nondiabetic women and men,
respectively. Diabetes was most strongly asso-
ciated with more severe levels of disability. A
total of 32% (26­39) of women and 15%
(11­20) of men with diabetes reported dis-
ability on at least 1 of the 3 tasks compared
with 14% (12­16) and 8% (6­9) of nondia-
betic women and men, respectively. A total
of 9% (6­13) of women and 7% (4­10) of
men with diabetes reported an inability to
do all 3 tasks compared with 4% (2.8­4.4)
and 2% (1.5­2.9) of nondiabetic women
and men, respectively.
Among both women and men, diabetes
was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased
odds of being able to perform each physical
task controlled for age, ethnicity, education,
and BMI (Table 2). Women with diabetes
also had substantially higher odds of report-
ing much difficulty in walking (OR 1.94
[1.23­3.06]), climbing steps (1.83 [1.13­
2.98]), and doing housework (2.28
[1.55­3.36]) compared with women with-
out diabetes. During the previous year,
women with diabetes were also more likely
to have fallen (1.58 [1.21­2.08]) and to
have had injurious falls (2.00 [1.25­3.22])
than women without diabetes. No signifi-
cant associations were evident between dia-
betes and falls in men.
Disability by age and duration of
diabetes
The adjusted odds of having a physical dis-
ability were higher with longer duration of
diabetes (P for trend 0.001 for both men
and women). Compared with women with-
out diabetes, the overall odds of disability
among women with a diabetes duration of
5 years, 6­14 years, and 15 years were
1.42 (0.90­2.23), 3.09 (1.82­5.25), and
2.71 (1.73­4.26), respectively. Among men,
the corresponding odds were 1.20
(0.74­1.94), 2.04 (1.20­3.49), and 2.45
(1.52­3.94), respectively.
Prevalence of inability to do 1 or more
of the physical tasks increased with greater
diabetes duration in all age­sex strata except
for men 60­69 years of age, among whom
this prevalence was 5% (Fig. 1). The
prevalence was 30% among all women
70 years of age with 5 years' diabetes
duration and was 50% among women
70 years of age with 15 years' diabetes
duration. Among men, the prevalence of
inability to do 1 or more task was 25%
among individuals 70 years of age with a
diabetes duration of at least 5 years.
Insulin-using individuals had the high-
est risk of physical disability. Compared
with women and men without diabetes, the
corresponding odds of overall disability
were 3.29 (1.94­5.58) among insulin-
using women and 2.89 (1.63­5.10) among
insulin-using men controlled for age, eth-
nicity, education, and BMI.
Physical performance tests
Women with diabetes were significantly
more likely to perform poorly on walking
speed (2.05 [1.47­2.86]), chair stands (1.36
[1.03­1.79]), and balance (1.89 [1.41­
2.52]) tasks controlled for age, ethnicity,
education, and BMI. After adjustment for
comorbidities, diabetes remained signifi-
cantly associated with poor performance on
all variables except chair stands. Men with
diabetes were 50% more likely to per-
form poorly on walking speed than men
without diabetes (1.52 [1.03­2.24]), but no
significant differences were evident on chair
stands or balance, nor were differences evi-
dent on walking speed after controlling for
diabetes-related comorbidities in men.
Effect of diabetes-related
comorbidities
Among women, CHD and BMI were more
important than other comorbidities in
explaining the increased disability risk
among individuals with diabetes (Table 3).

Controlling separately for BMI and CHD
reduced diabetes-related odds of disability
by 24 and 34%, respectively, whereas con-
trolling for CHD and BMI together reduced
the diabetes-related odds by 52%. Con-
trolling for other comorbidities including
stroke, poor vision, arthritis, and claudica-
tion led to more modest reductions in dia-
betes-related odds of disability. Among
men, controlling for BMI had little effect on
diabetes-associated disability, but control-
ling for CHD and stroke each reduced the
odds of diabetes-associated disability by
21­25%. After all measured comorbidi-
ties were added to the model, women and
men with diabetes still had a 50 and 46%
increased odds of disability, respectively,
versus people without diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS -- In this nationally
representative sample of older U.S. adults,
diabetes was associated with a 2- to 3-fold
increased risk of being unable to do mobil-
ity-related tasks. When applying this sam-
ple to the U.S. population, we estimate that
1.2 million (or approximately one-
fourth) of older American diabetic adults
either cannot walk one-fourth of a mile,
climb 10 stairs, or do housework. Approx-
imately one-half (or 2.5 million) have
some difficulty doing these tasks. Diabetes-
related disability was also reflected in several
physical function tests, including slower
walking speed, chair stand performance,
and balance. These findings are important
because physical disability, whether mea-
sured by self-report or by objective physical
function tests, predicts future declines in
health status, institutionalization, and
health services use as well as serious reduc-
tions in quality of life (1­6).
An excess risk of disability among
adults with diabetes is not surprising given
the associated comorbidities, including
CHD, peripheral vascular disease, stroke,
vision loss, and neuropathy. Previous stud-
ies have related diabetes to decreased qual-
ity of life, including decreased physical, role,
and social functioning and increased depen-
dence on others to perform activities of
daily living (7,9,10,18­21). Diabetes has
also been related to cognitive decline, which
could affect physical functioning (22).
Our results suggest that CHD is a
major contributor to diabetes-related dis-
ability among both men and women and
that stroke is an important contributor to
diabetes-related disability among men.
Comparison of models with and without
adjustment for BMI suggests that obesity is
also an important factor influencing dis-
ability among women and raises the ques-
tion of whether weight loss would decrease
disability among people with diabetes (23).
Visual impairment, arthritis, and claudica-
tion were also related to diabetes and were
secondary contributors to diabetes-associ-
ated disability in this study. Unfortunately,
we lacked data on other potential contrib-
utors to disability, including neuropathy,

Diabetes and physical disability
subclinical cardiovascular disease, and
cognitive impairment. We also lacked com-
plete data on lower-extremity amputations
and end-stage renal disease, but both of
these conditions are likely to be rare in this
noninstitutionalized sample.
Our findings suggest that, in people
with diabetes, impairments in lower-
extremity physical functioning are key con-
tributors to loss of physical independence.
Increased risk of walking and climbing dis-
ability were paralleled by decreases in gait,
balance, and ability to do chair stands. Sev-
eral pathophysiological factors could medi-
ate these differences, including impaired
blood flow and decreased muscle strength,
motor coordination, and proprioception.
Similarly, decreased cardiorespiratory
capacity has been associated with type 2
diabetes and may influence disability risk
(24). In addition, hyperglycemia has been
associated with general weakness, muscle
cramps, blurred vision, and dizziness (25).
This study is limited by its cross-sec-
tional design, so disability may have pre-
ceded diabetes rather than the reverse.
Cross-sectional studies are vulnerable to
survivor bias, which may partially explain
why the disability rates were higher for
women than for men. Disabled individuals
may have been more likely to be among the
nonrespondents to NHANES III, which
would lead to an underestimation of over-
all disability prevalence. Similarly, the fact
that NHANES III was conducted among
the noninstitutionalized U.S. population
could lead to an underestimation of the
total prevalence of physical disability.
Many of our variables were based on
self-report, including diabetes status. Self-
reported diabetes has been shown to be
reliable as a measure of diagnosed diabetes
(26,27), but some people with undiag-
nosed diabetes may have been misclassified
in the nondiabetic group. We replicated
our analyses among a subsample of adults
in whom glucose measurements were avail-
able and were thus able to classify individ-
uals with undiagnosed diabetes. These
analyses yielded similar overall results and
wider CIs because of the smaller sample
size. However, the relationship between
diabetes and walking disability was weaker
when diabetes was defined by American
Diabetes Association criteria because these
criteria likely resulted in a healthier sample.
Inherent limitations also exist in self-
reports of physical disability. For example,
reporting level of difficulty on tasks such as
walking or housework could be affected by
sex, home environment, and how much
these activities are part of one's daily rou-
tine. Previous research has found these
measures to have high predictive and face
validity, however, and associations between
problems with these tasks and diabetes in
our study were supported by several objec-
tive physical performance measures (5,6).
The results of this study may have
implications for disability prevention, clini-
cal management, and disability-free life
expectancy of people with diabetes. Poten-
tial strategies to limit disability include spe-
cialized lower-extremity strength and
balance training, tai chi, and walking, which
have been shown to be effective in main-
taining muscle mass, in preventing falls, and
in maintaining physical functioning (28,29).
Because a substantial proportion of diabetes-
related disability was accounted for by pre-
ventable comorbidities, other preventive
care practices including weight control;
management of blood lipids, blood pressure,
and glycemia; aspirin use; and foot and eye
care may improve long-term physical func-
tioning. Continued surveillance of diabetes-
related disability, increased awareness of
disability as a potentially modifiable com-
plication, and use of interventions to reduce
disability should become health priorities for
people with diabetes.
