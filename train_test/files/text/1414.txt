Peripheral Blood Count Abnormalities Among Patients
With Hepatitis C in the United States
Michael B. Streiff,1 Shruti Mehta,2 and David L. Thomas1,2
An estimated 2.7 million people in the United States are infected with the hepatitis C virus
(HCV), yet the influence of HCV infection on the peripheral blood count remains unknown.
To investigate the prevalence of low peripheral blood counts among HCV-infected adults in
the United States general population, we analyzed data collected in the third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). The study population consisted
of 16,196 individuals age 18 or older who had peripheral blood counts and data on HCV
infection. The lowest fifth percentile of each component of the peripheral blood was desig-
nated a priori as being low. HCV infection was assessed by antibody reactivity. HCV
antibody­positive individuals were 3-fold more likely to have low neutrophil counts (HCV
positive, 9% vs. HCV negative, 3%, P < .0001) and 2.6-fold more likely to have low platelet
counts (HCV positive, 13% vs. HCV negative, 5%, P < .0001) independent of other
evaluated factors. HCV infection was observed in more than 20% of persons with neutrophil
counts below 1.0  109/L or platelet counts less than 100  109/L. No association was
detected between anti-HCV status and anemia or other peripheral blood cell components. In
conclusion, HCV-infected persons in the general population of the United States are more
likely to have low neutrophil and platelet counts, and HCV testing should be considered for
persons with unexplained neutrophil counts below 1.0  109/L or platelet counts less than
100  109/L. Alternate causes of anemia should be considered for HCV-infected persons
with low red blood cell counts. (HEPATOLOGY 2002;35:947-952.)
An estimated 2.7 million people in the United States
have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.1 HCV
principally replicates in the liver and its cardinal
manifestation is progressive hepatic failure from fibro-
sis.2-4 Evidence of HCV replication also has been reported
in peripheral blood cells, and abnormal blood counts have
been noted in clinic patients with HCV infection.5-8
However, the frequency and severity of peripheral blood
cell count abnormalities in the majority of HCV-infected
individuals are unknown.
No universally accepted normal range exists for most
components of the peripheral blood count. In addition, a
number of factors are known to affect both the peripheral
blood count and the prevalence of HCV infection.1,9-11
Thus, the objective of this investigation was to evaluate
the frequency and severity of peripheral blood cell abnor-
malities in HCV-infected patients in the general popula-
tion after accounting for age, race, and other potential
confounding factors.
Patients and Methods
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III) was conducted by the United
States National Center for Health Statistics for the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention to assess the
health and nutritional status of a representative sample of
the United States civilian population, as previously de-
scribed.12,13 Approximately 34,000 individuals 2 months
of age or older were enrolled at 89 randomly selected
locations throughout the United States. Demographic,
medical, and behavioral information was collected from
participants by questionnaire. Laboratory evaluations and
physical examinations were performed on patients 6 years

of age and older. This analysis is restricted to 16,196
(91%) of 17,752 adults (18 years) who had physical
examinations and complete laboratory assessments in-
cluding HCV antibody (anti-HCV) testing.12,13
Laboratory Testing. Venous whole blood was drawn
into vacuum tubes containing potassium ethylenediami-
netetraacetic acid for assessment of the leukocyte count
and differential, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpus-
cular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean cor-
puscular hemoglobin concentration, red-cell distribution
width, platelet count, mean platelet volume, and platelet
distribution width. Complete blood counts were per-
formed in duplicate within 20 minutes of collection by
using a Coulter S-Plus Jr. automated hematology analyzer
(Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL), which has a linear
range of 0 to 999  109/L for platelets and 0 to 99 
109/L for white blood cells. Electronic differential counts
were confirmed in a subset by review of the peripheral
blood smear. All abnormal differentials were reviewed by
peripheral smear. The accuracy and completeness of he-
matology data were reviewed by the Serum Bank Branch,
Scientific Resources Program, National Center for Infec-
tious Diseases.
Serum chemistry profiles including total bilirubin, al-
bumin, and total protein were analyzed by using a Hitachi
Model 737 multichannel analyzer (Boehringer Manheim
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Anti-HCV testing was
performed by using a second-generation enzyme immu-
noassay (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). Positive sam-
ples were repeated and then confirmed by using the
MATRIX assay (Abbott Laboratories).1 A sandwich ra-
dioimmunoassay (Abbott Laboratories) was used to quan-
tify hepatitis B surface antigen in human serum. Serum
transaminases were performed on previously frozen sam-
ples and therefore were not evaluated.13
Statistical Analysis. All statistical analyses were per-
formed by using methods appropriate for complex survey
design and clustered data. Because of heterogeneity in
reference ranges used by clinical laboratories and the ab-
sence of clear biologic thresholds, hematologic markers
were examined according to their distribution in the
NHANES III adult population. Values below the fifth
percentile were considered low and were compared with
the remaining 95% designated as the normal range. These
conventions were used for analysis of all hematologic pa-
rameters by calculating a Pearson 2 statistic corrected for
complex survey design and clustered data. The relation-
ship between anti-HCV and blood neutrophils and plate-
lets was then further examined by using multivariate
logistic regression to adjust for potential confounding
variables including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index
(BMI), cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and hepatitis B
surface antigen status. When a low blood-cell index was
more common in HCV-infected patients, the outcome
variable (the blood count value) was altered across a clin-
ically meaningful range and the prevalence of HCV infec-
tion was reassessed.
Age and ethnicity were categorized according to the
survey design as suggested by United States National
Center for Health Statistics for analysis of NHANES III
data.13 Age was analyzed in 10-year intervals and ethnicity
was divided into 4 categories: non-Hispanic White, non-
Hispanic Black, Mexican American, and others, which
included other Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans.
The other category was excluded from analysis because of
small sample size and within-group heterogeneity. BMI,
defined as weight/height2 (kg/m2), was classified accord-
ing to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute cri-
teria. Individuals with a BMI less than 25, 25-29.9, 30-
34.9, and greater than 35 kg/m2 were categorized as lean
or normal, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese, re-
spectively.14 Cigarette smoking status was characterized as
never, former, or current, based on individual response at
the time of interview. Excessive alcohol intake was defined
as ethanol consumption greater than 50 g/day (approxi-
mately 5 drinks) during the past year.13
Analysis was performed by using STATA (Vs 6.0, Col-
lege Station, TX). All analyses incorporated sampling
weights, which are based on United States Census Bureau
data describing the age, sex, race, income, and geographic
location of the United States population, to provide ac-
curate estimates that were representative of the United
States population during the 6 years of the survey. These
sampling weights take into account the unequal probabil-
ities of selection owing to the cluster design of the survey,
nonresponse, and the planned oversampling of certain
minority populations.12,13
Results
A total of 16,196 NHANES III participants 18 years of
age or older had complete blood counts and anti-HCV
testing. These participants are similar to the entire survey
population with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity and
therefore are considered representative of the adult
United States population at the time of the survey (data
not shown). Three hundred ninety of the 16,196 partic-
ipants in the study sample (2.4%) were anti-HCV posi-
tive. As previously published, HCV infection was
significantly more common among non-Hispanic blacks,
men, persons aged 30 to 49 years old, persons consuming
more than 50 g ethanol/d, illegal drug users, persons with
a history of high-risk sexual behavior, persons infected
with hepatitis B virus, and individuals of lower socioeco-
nomic status.1

Leukocyte Counts. Overall, the median total leuko-
cyte count was 6.9  109/L (range, 1.8-71.4  109/L)
and 5% were less than 4.3  109/L. A greater percentage
of anti-HCV­positive individuals had leukocyte counts
less than 4.3  109/L, a result explained by a reduction in
neutrophils (Table 1). The median neutrophil count was
4.2  109/L (range, 0.2-21.8  109/L) and 5% were less
than 2.1  109/L. Neutrophil counts less than 2.1 
109/L were found in 9% of anti-HCV­positive persons
but only 3% of those without HCV infection (P 
.0001). Only 1 participant (anti-HCV negative) had a
neutrophil count less than 0.5  109/L.
In multivariate analysis, HCV antibody, age, ethnicity,
BMI, and cigarette smoking were independently associ-
ated with having a neutrophil count less than 2.1  109/L
(Table 2). Sex, ethanol use, and hepatitis B surface anti-
gen status were not associated with neutrophil counts less
than 2.1  109/L and did not affect the association of
anti-HCV status with neutrophil counts (data not
shown). Compared with anti-HCV­positive individuals
with neutrophil counts greater than or equal to 2.1 
109/L, those with neutrophil counts less than 2.1  109/L
were more likely to have a total serum bilirubin greater
than 32 mol/L (P  .02) and serum globulin greater
than 40 g/L (P  .01) but not a platelet count less than
100  109/L (P  .09) or serum albumin less than 30 g/L
(P  .97). Of anti-HCV­positive persons with neutro-
phil counts 2.1  109/L, 56% had abnormalities of 1 or
more of these 4 tests.
To identify the level at which a higher than expected
anti-HCV prevalence occurred, neutrophil counts were
categorized into 0.5  109/L strata and the proportion of
anti-HCV­positive persons in each was determined.
Greater than 70% of those with neutrophil counts be-
tween 0.5  109/L and 1.0  109/L were anti-HCV
positive (Fig. 1). This was significantly higher than the
HCV prevalence in other strata, 5% for neutrophil counts
between 1.0  109/L and 2.0  109/L and an average of
2% in all other strata. HCV RNA was detected in all
anti-HCV­positive persons with neutrophil counts be-
low 1.0  109/L, but only 74% of anti-HCV­positive
persons with higher neutrophil counts.1 Of all anti-
HCV­positive persons in NHANES III, 2% had a neu-
trophil count below 1.0  109/L.
Platelet Counts. The median platelet count was
267  109/L (range, 15-929  109/L) and 5% were less
than 175  109/L. Platelet counts less than 175  109/L
were found in 13% of anti-HCV­positive persons com-
pared with 5% of those without HCV infection (P 
.0001). No significant differences in mean platelet vol-

ume or platelet distribution width were noted among
anti-HCV­positive and ­negative individuals (data not
shown).
In multivariate analysis, age greater than 60 years, male
gender, and ongoing hepatitis B virus infection were in-
dependently associated with having a platelet count less
than 175  109/L (Table 3). BMI, alcohol use, and cig-
arette smoking were not associated with a platelet count
less than 175  109/L and did not affect its association
with anti-HCV status (data not shown). Although ethnic-
ity was not independently associated with platelet counts
less than 175  109/L, it appeared to modify the associ-
ation between HCV infection and the platelet count. The
association of HCV infection and a platelet count less
than 175  109/L was particularly strong among Mexican
Americans (odds ratio 7.82, 95% confidence interval
4.33-14.12), intermediate among non-Hispanic Blacks
(odds ratio 4.04, 95% confidence interval 2.28-7.16), and
weakest among non-Hispanic Whites (odds ratio 2.35,
95% confidence interval 1.09-5.07). Compared with
anti-HCV­positive persons with platelet counts greater
than or equal to 175  109/L, those with platelet counts
less than 175  109/L were more likely to have a serum
albumin less than 30 g/L (P  .001) and serum bilirubin
greater than 32 mol/L (P  .001), but not a neutrophil
count less than 2.1  109/L (P  .1) or serum globulin
greater than 40 g/L (P  .22). Of anti-HCV­positive
patients with low platelet counts, 49% had abnormalities
of 1 or more of these tests.
Platelet counts were categorized into 50  109/L strata
and the proportion of anti-HCV­positive patients in each
was determined. Greater than 50% of patients with plate-
let counts less than 50  109/L and greater than 20% of
patients with platelet counts less than 100  109/L were
anti-HCV positive (Fig. 2). This was significantly higher
than the HCV prevalence in other strata, 7% for counts
between 100  109/L and 150  109/L and an average of
2% for all other strata. HCV RNA was detected in all
anti-HCV­positive patients with platelet counts less than
100  109/L, but only 73% of anti-HCV­positive per-

The increase in anti-HCV prevalence noted in persons with neutrophil
counts between 8.5 and 9.0  109/L was explained by a higher
proportion of cigarette smokers in this stratum.)

Red Cell Counts. The median hemoglobin was 140
g/L (range, 50-196 g/L) and 5% were less than 115 g/L.
No significant differences were noted in the hemoglobin

NHANES participants. Similarly, no significant differ-
ences were detected between anti-HCV­positive and
­negative individuals in hematocrit, mean corpuscular
volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscu-
lar hemoglobin concentration, or red-cell distribution

Discussion
In this investigation, HCV-infected persons were more
likely to have low neutrophil and platelet counts in a
representative sample of the general population after ac-
counting for factors known to affect both peripheral
blood cell counts and HCV infection. These general pop-
ulation data contribute substantially to our understand-
ing of the relationship between HCV infection and the
peripheral blood count and indicate the prevalence of
HCV infection is substantially increased among patients
with moderate reductions in neutrophil and platelet
counts.
One potential implication of these data is that persons
with unexplained neutropenia or thrombocytopenia
should be tested for HCV infection. In this study, more
than 20% of patients with neutrophil counts below 1.0 
109/L or platelet counts less than 100  109/L had HCV
antibodies. In addition, all anti-HCV­positive patients
with counts below these thresholds had HCV RNA in
their blood, a positive predictive value for ongoing HCV
infection of 100%. Identification of persons with HCV
infection is important because effective treatment exists
and most HCV-infected persons are not aware of their
infection.15-17 Risk factor­based screening is the most im-
portant means of identifying HCV-infected persons in
the population. In this study, 25% of persons with HCV
infection and neutropenia or thrombocytopenia had a
history of illicit drug use and thus could also have had
their HCV infection detected if they acknowledged this
exposure to their health care provider. Because in practice
these behaviors are often not accurately assessed, practi-
tioners should test persons with unexplained neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia for HCV infection, as is already
recommended for those with elevated liver enzyme levels.
This analysis was not designed to identify the mecha-
nism of these associations. It is interesting to note that
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were associated with
several markers of severe liver disease such as an elevated
serum bilirubin or globulin level or a low serum albumin,
and that neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can be
found in patients with cirrhosis of many etiologies.18 On
the other hand, because the NHANES III study was con-
ducted in the community and not a liver disease clinic, it
would be surprising if a high proportion of subjects had
serious liver disease. Other studies have suggested that
HCV could cause thrombocytopenia through other
mechanisms, such as an autoimmune process.6-8,19 Unfor-
tunately, because liver and bone marrow biopsy speci-
mens were not obtained, additional research is required to
determine the biologic basis for these associations.
In this study, there were a number of factors that could
have confounded or modified the associations of HCV
infection with neutrophil and platelet counts.1,9-11,20 For
example, racial differences were observed in the strength
of the association between anti-HCV status and low
platelet counts. Although the bases for these findings are
not evident, the interrelationship between HCV infec-
tion, platelet and neutrophil counts, and multiple other
factors (e.g., race, age, cigarette smoking) underscores the
importance of adjusting for these in any future studies and
is a strength of the adjusted risk estimates determined in
the NHANES III investigation.
There are no universally accepted normal ranges for
components of the peripheral blood, and ranges that are
clinically useful vary substantially. Therefore, we estab-
lished normal ranges for each component based on the
distribution of values in a sample of the noninstitutional-
ized general population of the United States and exam-
ined the relationship between HCV infection and blood
counts across the full range of observed values. The neu-
trophil and platelet levels that are associated with HCV
infection in NHANES III are higher than what is the
lower range of many hospital laboratories. We believe this
is another instance in which the clinically meaningful lev-
els of blood components need to be established according
to the condition under consideration, not according to
arbitrarily selected external standards.
This analysis has several limitations. As mentioned ear-
lier, the cross-sectional design and lack of complete med-
ical information and long-term follow-up limit the extent
to which HCV infection can be considered the cause of
the hematologic abnormalities and impede identification
of the biologic basis of these findings. Cirrhosis, hyper-
splenism, bone marrow suppression, and autoimmune
destruction associated with HCV infection as well as co-
existing viral infections such as human immunodeficiency
virus potentially could influence these findings. Human
immunodeficiency virus infection is an especially impor-
tant potential confounder because it is transmitted by
similar routes and can cause thrombocytopenia.The lim-
HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 35, No. 4, 2002 STREIFF, MEHTA, AND THOMAS 951
ited data available for the NHANES III population do
not allow precise identification of a single cause and ex-
isting data suggest that multiple mechanisms may be re-
sponsible.6-8,18 Although the population-based sampling
clearly enhances the contribution this analysis makes to
prior clinic-based investigations, it is also possible that the
severity of hematologic findings is underestimated be-
cause persons with advanced HCV infection are more
likely to be institutionalized and thus not available for
study.
In summary, these data indicate HCV infection is as-
sociated with low neutrophil and platelet counts, but not
anemia, in the general population of the United States.
Further research is needed to assess the biologic basis for
these findings. In the meantime, practitioners should con-
sider screening patients for HCV infection with unex-
plained neutrophil counts below 1.0  109/L or platelet
counts less than 100  109/L.
