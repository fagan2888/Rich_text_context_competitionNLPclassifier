Retirement Effects on Parent­Adult
Child Contacts
Maximiliane E. Szinovacz, PhD,1 and Adam Davey, PhD2
Purpose: This study examined whether parents' retirement
influences their contacts (visits, telephone/letter) with adult
children outside the household. Design and Methods:
The study relied on data from the National Survey of
Families and Households. The sample consisted of parent­
adult child dyads where parents were aged 55­75 at time
2 and adult children resided outside the household at both
waves (N  2,153 parent­adult child dyads, based on re-
ports from 792 parents). Generalized estimating equations
(GEE) with robust standard errors were used. Results:
Retirement has no significant effect on telephone contacts.
Retired parents maintain frequent visits with children. For
children living within 10 miles, mothers' retirement is asso-
ciated with fewer and fathers' retirement with more visits.
This trend varies by number of children, length of retire-
ment, and child's gender. For children living more than 10
miles away, retired mothers decrease visits with childless
children, whereas retired fathers increase visits with child-
less children. Implications: We attribute these findings to
the gender-specific salience of child contacts for retirees
and suggest that future research address children's and
parents' expectations for postretirement contacts.
Key Words: Gender, Intergenerational relations, Kin
relationships
Despite considerable interest both in the conse-
quences of retirement and in the predictors of par-
ent­adult child contacts, few studies have linked
these two research areas. Studies addressing retire-
ment effects typically focus either on social contacts
or social networks in general (Bossé, Aldwin, Leven-
son, Spiro, & Mroczek, 1993; Bossé, Aldwin, Leven-
son, Workman-Daniels, & Ekerdt, 1990; Bossé &
Ekerdt, 1981; Francis, 1990; George, Fillenbaum, &
Palmore, 1984; Van Tilburg, 1992), whereas investi-
gations into parent­adult child relationships center
on familial factors such as geographical distance,
emotional attachment, or feelings of obligation (Law-
ton, Silverstein, & Bengtson, 1994; Rossi & Rossi,
1990). Yet, life-course theories stress that work and
family spheres are interdependent, and that events in
one sphere can influence events or relationships in
the other sphere (Bengtson & Allen, 1993; Moen,
1996). Investigation of changes in kin contacts after
retirement also has relevance for retirement prepara-
tion and counseling. Both parents and adult children
may either feel uncertainty or have unrealistic expec-
tations about their relationship after the parents' re-
tirement (Szinovacz, Ekerdt, & Vinick, 1992). For
example, parents may expect enhanced support from
children that the children are unable or unwilling to
provide (Remnet, 1987), and adult children may ex-
pect increased time commitments on the part of re-
tired parents (e.g., to take care of grandchildren) that
interfere with parents' planned retirement activities.
Such scenarios may generate conflict between gener-
ations and undermine parents' adaptation to the re-
tirement transition. This study addresses retirement
effects on parents' contacts with their adult children,
using panel data from the National Survey of Fami-
lies and Households (NSFH).
Literature Review
Evidence on retirement-related changes in social
contacts is scarce and inconsistent. George and col-
leagues (1984) report an increase in time spent with
friends among both women and men, whereas Bossé
and coworkers (1993) find a decrease in quantitative
but stability in qualitative social supports among men
who retired. A smaller study of retiring men (Van Til-
burg, 1992) indicates that the overall size of social
networks remained relatively stable over the retire-
ment transition, but at the same time there was con-
siderable fluctuation of network members. Relation-
ships with relatives tended to be more stable than
those with friends or acquaintances. These inconsis-

tent results are hardly surprising, as these studies rely
on data from divergent samples and periods and use
quite different measures of social contacts or supports.
Whereas research pertaining to the retirement
transition has focused on social network changes, in-
vestigations of parent­adult child relationships are
typically cross-sectional and mostly ignore parents'
employment status. These studies demonstrate con-
tinued close bonds between parents and adult chil-
dren into parents' later years (Eggebeen & Davey,
1998; Lawton et al., 1994; Rossi & Rossi, 1990).
The extent of interactions seems to depend on gender
and geographical distance (Lawton et al., 1994;
Rossi & Rossi, 1990) as well as on status transitions
of both parents and children such as parents' divorce
and remarriage (Kaufman & Uhlenberg, 1998). The
few studies considering parents' employment status
yield inconsistent results. Rossi and Rossi (1990)
show that mothers' full-time employment is associ-
ated with reduced face-to-face contacts with sons,
whereas sons report more contacts (visits and phone)
with full-time employed fathers. Logan and Spitze
(1996) report no significant effects of employment
status on visits or telephone contacts between par-
ents and adult children.
In summary, current research provides some evi-
dence that both parents' and adult children's em-
ployment status can influence intergenerational rela-
tions, and that retirement impinges on social networks.
However, the extent and direction of these effects re-
main unclear, and there is essentially no information
linking parents' retirement to contacts with their
adult children.
Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses
In view of the separate treatment of retirement
and intergenerational issues in past research, our the-
oretical approach integrates insights from both re-
search traditions. Studies of postretirement activities
and well-being typically proceed from the assump-
tion that adaptation to loss of the work role requires
a reorganization of retirees' activities (Kosloski, Gins-
burg, & Backman, 1984). It is not clear, however,
what type of reorganization is best suited to compen-
sate for the loss of work-related gratifications. Some
argue that engagement in new activities is most bene-
ficial, while others stress the importance of continu-
ity in retirees' lives (Atchley, 1976, 1999; Friedman
& Havighurst, 1954).
The broadest theoretical approach to intergenera-
tional relations is the intergenerational solidarity
framework developed by Roberts, Richards, and
Bengtson (1991). These researchers distinguish six
interdependent dimensions of intergenerational soli-
darity (structural, normative, functional, associa-
tional, affectional, and consensual). They further
demonstrate that associational solidarity (contact
among family members, the dimension of solidarity
that constitutes the dependent variable in this study)
is influenced by normative and affectional solidarity,
that is, norms and feelings of closeness (Roberts &
Bengtson, 1990). Other research shows that struc-
tural solidarity (geographical distance) has a strong
impact on contacts among family members (Logan
& Spitze, 1996; Rossi & Rossi, 1990). An alternative
approach by Cicirelli (1989) emphasizes the impor-
tance of attachment, obligation, and dependency (or
needs) for kin relationships. The first two dimensions
are akin to affectional and normative solidarity,
whereas dependency introduces the notion of needs
as predictor of kin interactions and supports (Davey
& Eggebeen, 1998). More recently, researchers (Bel-
liston, Davey, & Bookout, 1999; Kaufman & Uhlen-
berg, 1998) have begun to explore ways in which
changing needs and resources of each generation
might affect changes and generational differences in
intergenerational solidarity. This approach under-
lines the importance of considering intergenerational
relationships from a dyadic level (i.e., one that con-
siders parents' relationships with each child sepa-
rately).
Based on this earlier work, we suggest that kin
contacts are affected by opportunity structures (espe-
cially time constraints and geographical distance),
feelings of obligation (norms), and the salience of
specific kin relationships. Salience most likely derives
from affectional solidarity, as well as from family
members' needs for kin interactions. It is important
to consider these dimensions for each family member
involved in kin interactions. Thus, parent­adult child
contacts will depend on both parents' and children's
opportunity structures and on parents' and children's
feelings of obligation and salience.
We further contend that reorganization of kin con-
tacts after parents' retirement will reflect these influ-
ences. However, we lack adequate data to establish
the impact of normative solidarity (the NSFH only
contains data on attitudes toward coresidence and fi-
nancial supports, which probably have little relevance
for norms pertaining to associational solidarity).
Consequently, our hypotheses focus on salience and
constraints. Whether retired parents strive to enhance
contacts with their children will depend foremost on
whether such contacts can compensate for the role
loss experienced upon retirement and thus the sa-
lience of contacts with the children. Specifically, con-
tacts with children can compensate for the loss of so-
cial contacts with work colleagues, and they can
provide the basis for identity enhancement in the
roles of parent and grandparent. Because we lack a
direct measure of kin salience, we rely on indicators
that have been linked to salience of kin relations in
past research. Earlier investigations suggest that sa-
lience of kin interactions is influenced by gender. Spe-
cifically, women seem to attach more importance to
and are more involved in kin interactions than men
(Logan & Spitze, 1996; Rossi & Rossi, 1990), al-
though men also seem to derive some gratification
from the grandparent role (Spitze & Ward, 1998). In
addition, the salience of contacts may vary by child's
gender. Earlier studies indicate the importance of
same-sex ties (Kaufman & Uhlenberg, 1998). This
implies that mothers may derive more gratification
193

from interactions with daughters, whereas men may
gain more satisfaction from contacts with sons. Sa-
lience of child contacts will also depend on whether
retired parents have alternative roles that may satisfy
their social and identity needs, most importantly the
marital role. Married men in particular seem to ob-
tain fulfillment of social needs outside the work role
foremost from their spouses (Antonucci & Akiyama,
1995). In addition, emotional closeness to specific
children will likely determine salience of contacts
with these children after retirement. We thus hypoth-
esize that retired parents will seek increased contacts
with adult children if they feel close to the child, if the
parents are not married (this applies particularly to
male retirees), and if the child has children. We fur-
ther hypothesize that women will be more inclined to
enhance contacts with daughters, whereas men will
be more likely to increase contacts with sons.
Previous research further suggests that adaptation
to retirement may proceed in stages. Retirees initially
engage in nonroutine projects and activities such as
travel or geographical moves that tend to be exciting
and satisfying but of relatively short duration (the
so-called "honeymoon" period; see Atchley, 1976;
Ekerdt, Bossé, & Levkoff, 1985). This period is fol-
lowed by the establishment of a more enduring re-
tirement lifestyle. We suggest that enhanced contacts
with adult children are more likely to be a pattern es-
tablished in this latter period. Thus, we hypothesize
that enhancement in contacts will be more likely
among parents who have been retired for two or
more years.
Although salience of kin relationships is likely to
influence whether retirees direct their search for
compensating postretirement activities toward inter-
actions with kin, the implementation of such aspira-
tions can be limited by deficient opportunity, partic-
ularly geographical distance and time constraints. As
noted earlier, geographical distance has been consis-
tently linked to frequency of association with kin
(Logan & Spitze, 1996; Rossi & Rossi, 1990). Sup-
port for the impact of other constraints is limited and
inconsistent. There is some indication that children's
employment may curtail relations with their parents
(Kaufman & Uhlenberg, 1998; Rossi & Rossi, 1990).
Another constraint may derive from the number of
children. Although having numerous children seems
to enhance parents' ability to see any child (Uhlen-
berg & Cooney, 1990), it is not clear how number of
children influences contacts with each individual
child. Recent research on grandparenthood suggests,
for example, that individual grandparent­grand-
child contacts decline with the number of grandchil-
dren (Uhlenberg & Hammill, 1998). Similarly, par-
ents with more children are obliged to divide attention
among children, which may reduce interactions with
each individual child. We thus hypothesize that post­
retirement increases in parent­adult child contacts
should be more pronounced for parent­child dyads
who live close to each other, and that they should be
less pronounced for full-time employed children and
for parents with numerous children.
Methods
Sample
The analyses rely on data from the National Sur-
vey of Families and Households (NSFH), conducted
in 1987­88 and 1992­94. The NSFH is a multistage
area probability sample with oversamples for minor-
ities and selected other groups (e.g., one-parent fami-
lies, families with stepchildren, cohabitors, and re-
cently married individuals). Data were collected from
a randomly selected household member aged 19 or
more, his/her spouse, and, in some cases, a tertiary
household member. First-wave interview response
rates for the successfully screened households were
73.5% for the main sample and 76.8% for the over-
sample, resulting in a total sample of 13,008 respon-
dents (for a detailed description of the study, see
Sweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988). The wave 2 inter-
views were completed by 10,005 respondents. We
use weights to adjust for nonresponses at time 1 and
attrition at time 2.
Because our analyses focus on changes in contacts
brought about by the retirement transition, we se-
lected a subsample at risk of retirement. This sub-
sample consists of respondents aged 55­75 at time 2
who were employed 10 hours or more at time 1 and
had adult children outside the household at both
times. The age range corresponds with typical retire-
ment ages, and the restriction to 10 hours of employ-
ment ensures that parents pursued some regular em-
ployment preceding retirement. However, only very
few respondents (2.2%) worked fewer than 10 hours
at baseline. In addition, we excluded from the sample
those parents who reported receipt of health care
from any adult child (5.3%). This restriction is nec-
essary to avoid confounding of associational (social
contacts) and functional (supports) solidarity and to
ensure that potential increases in contacts are not
due to changes in parents' health and need for care.
As NSFH respondents reported on contacts with
each adult child, the data were accumulated for each
parent­child dyad. Thus, the parent­child dyads and
not the parents are the primary unit of analysis (for a
similar approach see Uhlenberg & Hammill, 1998).
The final unweighted sample size consisted of 2,153
parent­adult child dyads (based on responses from
792 parents). Not considered in the analyses were
adult children for whom reports were only available
at one wave (children who "disappeared" between
waves or were first mentioned at time 2), as well as
children who moved into or out of their parents'
household. This is necessary because analysis of
change in contacts requires comparable information
at both waves. The data refer exclusively to adult
children who were age 19 or older at baseline.
Nonresponses in panel data can lead to biased re-
sults when cases with missing data are dropped from
the analyses (Little & Rubin, 1987), especially when
data are not missing completely at random (MCAR)
as is the case for our analyses. We therefore created
five complete-case data sets using the regression
method provided by SPSS (SPSS, 1997). The data
194 The Gerontologist
shown in the tables are based on multiple imputation
inference using NORM (Schafer, 1997) from analy-
ses performed on these five data sets. To assess the
sensitivity of our findings to the imputation methods
used here, we compared our results with those ob-
tained using the expectation­maximization method,
as well as reliance on nonimputed data (listwise dele-
tion), yielding highly similar findings in each case.
This suggests that results are fairly stable and only
minimally affected by the imputation method.
Respondents are close to or at retirement age (M 
62.8), and 56% are women. Eighteen percent of the
sample are Black and 6% are from other minorities.
Sixty-one percent of respondents were married at
time 2. Education is slightly above the high school
level (M  12.3 years). Most respondents (65%)
worked full time at baseline, and 45% retired be-
tween waves. The adult children are equally divided
by gender; 64% of the children are themselves par-
ents, and 76% were employed full time at time 2.
More than one third of the children (36%) lived
within 10 miles of their parents at time 2. Children's
ages varied considerably (range  23 to 55; M  37).
Dependent Variables
Two dependent variables were used in the analy-
ses: visits and telephone/letter contacts at time 2.
Note that in all cases the analyses relied on the par-
ents' reports. Frequency of visits and letter/telephone
contacts was measured with the question: During the
last 12 months, how often did you see (talk on the
telephone or receive a letter) from [child]? Answer
categories were: 1  not at all, 2  once a year, 3 
several times a year, 4  1­3 times a month, 5 
once a week, 6  more than once a week. Wave 1
visits and telephone/letter contacts were included as
predictor variables in all analyses. Thus, the depen-
dent variables reflect contacts at time 2 net of con-
tacts at time 1. At time 1, respondents reported see-
ing their children on average several times a month
(M  3.99) and to have somewhat more frequent
telephone/letter contacts (M  4.54).
Independent Variables
The major independent variable is parents' retire-
ment. We rely on full withdrawal from the labor
force to measure retirement. This definition may dif-
fer from self-definition as retiree (Ekerdt & DeViney,
1990; Szinovacz & DeViney, 1999). Because em-
ployment-related time constraints limit parents' abil-
ity to interact with children or to travel to visit chil-
dren, it is most likely that parents' withdrawal from
the labor force (rather than retirement from the main
career job) precipitates changes in contacts with chil-
dren. Length of retirement was operationalized by
subdividing retirees into those retired less than 2 years
and those retired 2 years or more. This dichotomy
corresponds with our hypothesis concerning a poten-
tial honeymoon effect. Preliminary analyses further
indicate that there are no differences between those
retired 2­3 years and those retired longer. Date of re-
tirement was only assessed in the questionnaires
given to respondents and has a relatively high num-
ber of missing values (7%). Because imputation of
missing values for a subpopulation (retirees) is prob-
lematic, we developed an extra category for missing
cases and included this category in the analyses.
Thus, the reference group consists exclusively of per-
sons who did not retire between waves.
Additional independent variables are parents' and
children's gender, parents' marital status, parents'
perceived emotional closeness to each child (mea-
sured at baseline), the number of children each par-
ent has outside the household, children's parental
status, children's employment, and geographical dis-
tance. Gender of both parents and children was
dummy-coded (female  1, male  0).
Parents' marital status was coded into two dummy
variables, those married and those widowed at time
2. Divorcees and the very few never-married parents
are the reference. This distinction reflects earlier re-
search findings indicating that it is divorced parents,
especially, who may lose contacts with their children
(Kaufman & Uhlenberg, 1998). In addition, change
in marital status between waves was controlled in the
analyses.
Parents' emotional closeness to each child was
only measured at baseline. Parents were asked to de-
scribe their relationship with each child (1  very
poor, 7  excellent).
Number of parents' children refers exclusively to
adult children outside the household, as these are the
children of interest in this study. Because of the dis-
tribution of this variable (fewer than 5% have only
one child outside the household), we differentiate
among parents who have only one or two children,
those with three children, and those with four or
more children. Although children in the household
will also compete for parents' attention, contacts
with these children are not subject to change. How-
ever, change in household composition was con-
trolled in the analyses.
Children's parental status was treated as a dichot-
omous variable (1  child has biological children in
the household; reference  child has no biological
children living in the household).
Measurement of children's employment status is
based on the question: Is (child) currently working
full time, part time, or not at all? This information
was only provided at time 2. We differentiate be-
tween children employed full time and those em-
ployed part time or not at all. Preliminary analyses
indicated that there is no difference in contacts be-
tween part-time and not employed children.
Measurement of geographic distance is based on
parents' reports of how far away (in miles) each child
lived at time 1 and time 2. In line with earlier re-
search (Rossi & Rossi, 1990), we use 10 miles as the
criterion for distinguishing children who live within
parents' immediate neighborhood from those living
outside the parents' immediate neighborhood. In ad-
dition, change in distance between waves was con-
trolled in all analyses.
195

Other controls included in the analyses are race,
whether parents worked full time at baseline, parents'
limitations in activities of daily living at time 2,
change in parents' self-reported health, change in par-
ents' income, change in spouse's employment status
between waves, whether the child is the biological
child of the respondent's spouse, changes in parents'
and children's marital status between waves, and chil-
dren's age. Means and standard deviations of all vari-
ables (including controls) are shown in Table 1.
Data Analyses
Our analyses refer to parent­adult child dyads.
This means that parents with more than one adult
child are represented more than once in the data set
and observations are not independent. Under such
circumstances, standard statistical procedures yield
downwardly biased standard errors. To overcome
this problem, our analyses rely on generalized esti-
mating equations (GEE; see Liang & Zeger, 1986)
with clusters for family unit (parent's identification
number), using a random-effects model and addi-
tional adjustments for robust standard errors with
the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance
(Stata, 1997). Coefficients obtained from GEE are
akin to unstandardized linear regression coefficients,
although Stata does not provide standardized esti-
mates or R-square statistics.
Interactions were tested in line with standard re-
gression procedures, that is, equations with higher or-
der interactions were tested first and include all lower
order interaction terms (Aiken & West, 1991). We
started with the highest order terms allowed by sub-
group distribution, which are triple interactions. We
first tested interactions by parents' gender, geographi-

cal distance to each child, and retirement. As this in-
teraction proved to be significant, we performed all
subsequent analyses separately for children living
within 10 miles of the parent and children living fur-
ther away. We then tested for interactions by parent's
gender, parent's retirement, and each of the other hy-
pothesized contingencies (child's gender, parent's mar-
ital status, emotional closeness to the child, number of
children, child's parental status, child's employment)
in separate equations (e.g., Parent's gender  Parent's
retirement  Child's gender). If the higher order term
was not significant, the next lower order term was
tested (e.g., Child's gender  Retirement, Parent's
gender  Retirement). This procedure provides some
assurance that multiple interaction terms do not
evolve through multicollinearity among the interac-
tion terms. In case of significant interactions, we fur-
ther estimated outcomes (frequency of contacts) for
the pertinent subgroups from the regression equations
(Aiken & West, 1991). These results are not shown in
the tables but are described in the Discussion section.
Tests for multicollinearity were performed. Vari-
ance inflation (Fox, 1991) for the full model with
controls (but without the interaction terms) yielded a
mean VIF of 1.30. This indicates that multicollinear-
ity is not a problem in our analyses.
Results
The main objective of our analyses was to estab-
lish whether parent­adult child contacts are affected
by parents' retirement, and whether such effects are
contingent on selected parent and child characteris-
tics. The first step in our analyses was to establish
whether retirement has any effect on visits or tele-
phone contacts. Preliminary analyses (not shown) in-
dicate that retirement does influence visits, but there
are no effects for telephone contacts. Because tele-
phone contacts are not influenced by retirement, all
additional analyses pertain to visits.
Having established that visits are affected by re-
tirement, we explored predicted contingencies of this
effect. We first examined whether retirement effects
differ for contacts with children living nearby (within
10 miles) and those living further away, and whether
such effects vary by parent's gender. These analyses
(see Table 2, first data column) substantiate that the
Retirement  Distance  Parent's gender interaction
is significant. Inspection of the interaction indicates
that among parent­child dyads living within 10 miles
of each other, mothers who retired see their children
less frequently than mothers who remained em-
ployed, whereas retired fathers report more frequent
visits than continuously employed fathers. Among
parent­child dyads who do not live close to each
other, visits occur less frequently and are similar for
employed and retired men and women.
In view of the strong effect of geographical distance,
we tested the other hypothesized relationships sepa-
rately for parent­child dyads living within 10 miles of
each other and those living further apart. In addition
to parents' gender, we expected children's gender to af-
fect changes in contacts after retirement. Our analyses
confirm that children's gender has some influence on
retirement-related changes in visits (Table 2, model 1).
Specifically, retirees (both fathers and mothers) seem
to increase visits with daughters and slightly reduce
contacts with sons. This effect is restricted to parent­
child dyads living close to each other.
Salience of post-retirement contacts was also pre-
dicted to vary by children's parental status. This ef-
fect is confirmed for parent­child dyads living more
than 10 miles apart and varies by parent's gender
(see Table 2, second data column). Mothers seem to
maintain a relatively high level of contacts with chil-
dren who are themselves parents, regardless of the
mother's employment status. In contrast, mothers'
visits with childless children seem to decline after
retirement. Fathers increase contacts with childless
children after they retire but decrease visits with chil-
dren who are parents. Among parent­child dyads liv-
ing within 10 miles of each other, child's parenthood
has no effect on post-retirement changes in visits.
Salience was also expected to be reflected in par-
ents' feelings of closeness to the child and in parents'
needs (based on their marital status). We find no sup-
port for either hypothesis. Retirement-related changes
in visits are not contingent on parents' feelings of
closeness to the child nor on their marital status.
Our final hypothesis pertaining to salience of post-
retirement contacts referred to length of retirement.
We expected a stronger influence for parents who
were past the honeymoon period, that is, those re-
tired 2 years or more. The data confirm that length
of retirement matters (Table 2, model 3). It is prima-
rily mothers retired 2 years or more who decrease
visits with children living nearby. Retired fathers, on
the other hand, report more visits with nearby chil-
dren regardless of length of retirement, although this
trend is particularly pronounced for fathers retired
under 2 years. Length of retirement has no impact on
visits with children living more than 10 miles away.
In addition to geographical distance, we expected
children's employment and number of children to
constrain parents' aspirations for post-retirement con-
tacts. We find no support for an influence of chil-
dren's employment status. Number of children out-
side the household does moderate retirement effects
for parent­child dyads living within 10 miles of each
other (Table 2, model 2). Mothers' retirement seems
to lead to a decline in visits primarily if they have
four or more children outside the household. In con-
trast, fathers are particularly prone to increase con-
tacts after retirement if they have four or more chil-
dren, whereas fathers of one or two children outside
the household tend to have fewer post-retirement vis-
its with these children. Among parent-child dyads
living more than 10 miles apart, number of children
does not moderate retirement effects.
Discussion
Our analyses were guided by the assumption that
contacts with adult children may help retirees com-
197

pensate for the loss of social contacts at work and
provide them with identity-enhancing activities in the
roles of parent and grandparent. We further hypoth-
esized that such social and identity-enhancing oppor-
tunities may be curtailed by geographical distance
and time constraints.
Our results suggest that retirement has some effect
on visits between parents and their adult children,
whereas telephone contacts seem to be unaffected by
parents' retirement. That we find no retirement ef-
fects on telephone contacts is hardly surprising. Tele-
phone contacts are less likely to be constrained by
parents' employment, and they also are unlikely to
compensate for loss of the work role. This finding
does suggest, however, that visits and telephone
contacts have a different meaning and consequently
should be treated separately. Some earlier studies
combine these two types of associational solidarity
(e.g., Lawton et al., 1994).
Retirement effects on visits are quite complex and
are contingent on a variety of circumstances. Given
the constraints associated with long-distance rela-

198 The Gerontologist
tionships, we expected retirement to have only a
modest impact on visits with children living more
than 10 miles from their parents. This hypothesis
was partially supported: Retirement effects occur
foremost among parent­child dyads living close to
each other. However, consideration of the child's
parental status somewhat modifies this conclusion.
Among mothers, the grandparent role seems to over-
ride potential employment-related constraints, lead-
ing to fairly constant contacts over the retirement
transition with adult children who are themselves
parents. On the other hand, mothers' contacts with
distant childless children decline after retirement,
suggesting that such contacts have little appeal to
mothers as a post-retirement endeavor or that child-
less children are particularly uninterested in contacts
with retired mothers. The opposite holds for fathers'
contacts with distant children, that is, after retire-
ment they visit slightly more with childless children
and slightly less with children who are parents. As
these differences are fairly small, they must be inter-
preted with caution. Perhaps retired fathers obtain
more gratification from adult-to-adult contacts with
children than from greater involvement in a distant
grandparent role.
Changes in post-retirement visits with children liv-
ing nearby vary by child's gender, as well as by par-
ents' gender, length of retirement, and number of
children. To the extent that retired parents increase
contacts with nearby children at all, such increases
seem to occur primarily with daughters. This finding
contradicts our assumption that retired parents may
seek out activities with same-sex children. It might
indicate that daughters are more inclined than sons
to accommodate retired parents' needs for enhanced
contacts. It is also conceivable, however, that con-
tacts with daughters (who may be more socialized to-
ward maintaining close relations with parents and
more attuned to parents' needs) are more gratifying
to retirees.
Parents' gender and length of retirement jointly in-
fluence contacts with children living within 10 miles
of the parent. Contrary to our hypothesis, retired
mothers tend to spend less and retired fathers more
time with children than their employed counterparts.
For mothers, this trend seems to become more pro-
nounced with length of retirement and number of
children, whereas it is fairly stable for fathers. We at-
tribute this difference to the gendered division of la-
bor throughout men's and women's working years.
Employed mothers typically carry the main burden
of family work, leaving them little time to engage in
leisure activities (Ferree, 1991; Lopata, 1995). In
contrast, men are less involved in kin work (Anto-
nucci & Akiyama, 1995; Rossi & Rossi, 1990), and
especially employed men devote little time to other
family work such as household activities or child
care (Ferree, 1991). This means that men and women
enter retirement under quite different circumstances.
Retired men may very well feel that they neglected
contacts with their children while working and use
their extra time to "catch up" when opportunity al-
lows (i.e., when the children live nearby). Retired
women, on the other hand, will usually have main-
tained close ties with their children throughout their
working years and may feel less of a need to reestab-
lish a close relationship. In retirement they may see
their first opportunity to engage in personal leisure
activities. As the trend toward reduced contacts is
most prominent among women with several chil-
dren, it may reflect special needs for personal leisure
among women who had been heavily burdened by
multiple responsibilities. Furthermore, married women
often take charge of the couple's retirement activities
(Keating & Cole, 1980), and this responsibility may
detract from their increasing contacts with adult chil-
dren. It is also possible that children are particularly
amenable to enhance contacts with retired fathers,
with whom they probably had fewer contacts in the
past. Contacts with retired mothers, on the other
hand, may lack novelty, and mothers' attempts to en-
hance contacts may be perceived as an imposition by
their children (Remnet, 1987).
We further hypothesized that time constraints
may inhibit enhanced contacts with children after re-
tirement. We find no support for the assumption that
children's employment would moderate the impact
of retirement. The second predicted constraint, num-
ber of children, does moderate retirement effects on
contacts but not in the expected direction. Retired fa-
thers are particularly likely to enhance contacts with
nearby children if they have four or more children,
whereas retired mothers' tendency to decrease con-
tacts with nearby children prevails among mothers
with four or more children outside the household.
For mothers of multiple children, gratifications de-
rived from the parent role may be saturated, and
they may consequently seek other endeavors in re-
tirement. The finding for fathers could reflect multi-
ple opportunities, that is, fathers with several adult
children have more opportunity for contacts and ap-
parently take advantage of this opportunity. It is also
conceivable that fathers of multiple children are
more kin-oriented than men with fewer children and
thus more inclined to gear retirement activities to-
ward contacts with their children.
Taken together, our findings indicate that retired
parents' contacts with their adult children depend on
selected parent and child characteristics. This sug-
gests that both parents' and children's expectations
and wishes, as well as selected constraints (especially
geographical distance), impinge on parents' post-
retirement contacts with their children. As we lack
data on either parents' or children's desired contact
frequency, we cannot establish whether the observed
patterns reflect either party's wishes or what type of
compromises parents and children reach. For exam-
ple, retired mothers may decrease contacts with chil-
dren to pursue other endeavors, or their children
may reduce contacts to avoid potential imposition by
retired mothers. If retirees' expectations are not met,
they may be forced to amend their plans for post-
retirement activities. Some parents may also exert
pressure on their children to meet their expectations.
199

Either scenario is likely to kindle conflicts between
retired parents and their children.
It is also important to note that, although all dis-
cussed interactions effects are significant and con-
tribute significantly to model fit, the observed differ-
ences in contact frequency are quite small, suggesting
considerable continuity in parent­child contacts over
the retirement transition. This would suggest that
post-retirement contacts with children have only lim-
ited importance as a source for retirees' social con-
tact and identity enhancement needs. This finding is
in line with earlier research suggesting that retirees
derive more satisfaction from contacts with friends
than from contacts with relatives (Dorfman, Heck-
ert, Hill, & Kohout, 1988). It is only under special
conditions that parents seek fulfillment of such needs
through contacts with their children. Furthermore,
our analyses, based on all parent­adult child dyads,
essentially provide a weighted (by family size) aver-
age of contacts for parents who have more than one
adult child. Thus, it is quite possible that retired par-
ents simultaneously increase contacts with one child
and decrease contacts with another. Such selective
changes in contacts with specific children are re-
flected in relationships pertaining to child character-
istics but not in relationships pertaining to parent
characteristics.
Our findings may also be subject to methodologi-
cal and data limitations. We lack indicators for some
key variables (e.g., a direct measure of kin salience)
and have rather poor measures for other indicators
(e.g., affectional solidarity). Indeed, our failure to
find a moderating effect of perceived closeness on
post-retirement contacts most likely can be attrib-
uted to measurement quality and the very skewed
distribution of the closeness variable (most parents
reported feeling extremely close to their children). In
view of these caveats, further research is clearly
needed. Most important would be comparisons of
expectations and aspirations for post-retirement con-
tacts on the part of parents and children, and assess-
ment of the implementation of such expectations af-
ter retirement. Future studies should also explore
retirement effects on other dimensions of intergener-
ational solidarity and further subgroup variations in
retirement effects (e.g., by race).
Despite their limitations, our findings lend them-
selves to some recommendations for retirement plan-
ners and family counselors. They suggest that gender-
stereotyped expectations about men's and women's
post-retirement activities (women will spend time with
kids, men will go to the golf course) may not fit reality.
Similarly, we find little support for the bumper-sticker
notion that retired parents will leave their children be-
hind and devote their retirement leisure exclusively to
nonfamily pursuits. Retired parents do keep in close
touch with their adult children. Thus, retirement plan-
ners and family counselors need not be concerned that
retirees will "abandon" their children. Rather, concern
should be directed toward the implementation of real-
istic plans for post-retirement kin relationships and to-
ward both generations' ability to compromise on a
level of contact that meets parents' and children's ex-
pectations and needs.
