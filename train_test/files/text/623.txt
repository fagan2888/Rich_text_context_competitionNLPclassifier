Data from the Health and Retirement Survey reveal extremely low levels of health insurance
coverage among Hispanics and, especially, among Mexican Americans. The data reveal that
this lack of insurance is associated with lower rates of employer-based and privately
purchased coverage. Even after controlling for a large number of insurance-related factors,
Hispanics have rates of health insurance coverage that are lower than those of either
non-Hispanic blacks or whites. This serious lack of health insurance coverage among
preretirement-age Hispanics has serious implications both for health, because the lack of
insurance represents a major barrier to health care, and for the adequacy of retirement
coverage, because private insurance represents an important supplement to Medicare.

Insurance Coverage Among Adult Hispanics1

The United States, unlike most other developed
nations of the world, does not provide comprehen-
sive and universal health care for its citizens as a
citizenship right. Rather, in this country, for those
under 65, the state plays only the role of provider of
last resort, and for the majority of individuals health
care must be purchased on the open market. As a
consequence, the quantity and quality of medical
care that one receives is determined by one's ability
to pay, and because medical care for anything but the
simplest problems is prohibitively expensive, access
to health insurance is crucial to ensuring adequate
health care to individuals and their families (U.S.
General Accounting Office, 1992). In the U.S., there-
fore, understanding differences in access to health
insurance is crucial to understanding differences in
access to health care. Health insurance represents a
real form of wealth because, like money, it allows
one to acquire the goods and services necessary for a
healthy and productive life.
Historically, Hispanics have had the lowest rates of
either public or private health insurance coverage of
any racial or ethnic group in the United States (U.S.
General Accounting Office, 1992; Valdez, 1993). In
1990, approximately 32% of Hispanics of all ages had
no health insurance of any sort, compared to approx-
imately 13% of non-Hispanic whites and 20% of
blacks (National Council of la Raza, 1992). The core of
the problem consists of very low rates of private or
employer-based health insurance among Hispanics.
In 1990, 52% of blacks and 78% of non-Hispanic
whites reported owning private health insurance,

whereas less than half of Hispanics (48%) reported
any private insurance of any sort (National Council of
la Raza, 1992).
What is most surprising is that this lack of private
insurance among Hispanics is not compensated for
by public insurance (U.S. General Accounting
Office, 1992). Even though they are a relatively young
population with high fertility rates and low overall
family incomes, in 1990 only 18% of Hispanics re-
ceived Medicaid compared to 25% of blacks (Na-
tional Council of la Raza, 1992). Although rates of
health insurance coverage are low for Hispanics as a
population, they differ greatly depending upon spe-
cific nationality group. Among Hispanics, Central
and South Americans and Mexican Americans have
the lowest levels of health insurance coverage (ap-
proximately 60% and 64% in 1990) and Puerto Ricans
the highest (86%). In 1990, 74% of Cuban Americans
and 79% of other Hispanics had some form of health
insurance (National Council of la Raza, 1992).
This lack of health insurance among Hispanics is
part of a package that includes low levels of educa-
tion, high rates of unemployment and underemploy-
ment, jobs that do not provide health benefits, and
residence in states such as Florida and Texas that
have highly restrictive Medicaid eligibility require-
ments (Dunkelberg, 1992). The consequences of a
lack of health insurance are serious because in the
United States a lack of health insurance represents a
major barrier to health care (U.S. General Account-
ing Office, 1992). In conjunction with poverty and
barriers related to language, culture, and geographic
location, the lack of insurance has serious implica-
tions for the health and well-being of Hispanic Amer-
icans (Chesney, Chavira, Hall, & Gary, 1982; Estrada,
Trevino, & Ray, 1990; Guendelman, & Schwalbe,
1986; Wolinsky et al., 1989). Unfortunately, the situa-
332 The Gerontologist
tion is only getting worse because the number of
uninsured Hispanics is increasing at the same time
that the number of uninsured blacks and non-
Hispanic whites is decreasing (National Council,
1992). If these trends continue as the result of em-
ployer inability to provide health care and attempts
by the federal and state governments to control the
rise in the cost of medical care, the health and well-
being of an ever-growing number of both young and
older Hispanics may be placed in jeopardy.
Although the problem of a lack of adequate insur-
ance is most serious among the young, among older
individuals, Hispanics are also the least likely to be
insured. Although estimates vary, it is clear that a
substantial fraction of Hispanics over the age of 65 do
not participate in Medicare. Of those who do, a
smaller fraction have private health insurance to
cover the costs that Medicare does not cover. Data
from the 1990 census and from other specialized
surveys indicate that although less than 1% of non-
Hispanic white elderly individuals and 2% of black
elderly individuals reported no health insurance, a
substantial fraction of Hispanics over the age of 65
report that they have no health insurance (Andrews,
1989; Angel, 1994; National Council of la Raza, 1992).
Data from a survey of Hispanics aged 65 and older
sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund during the
mid-1980s and recently collected data from a study of
Mexican Americans over the age of 65 in the five
Southwestern states (Markides, Rudkin, Angel, &
Espino, in press; Westat, Inc., 1989) reveal that, al-
though in comparison to non-Hispanic whites a
higher proportion of all Hispanic groups report no
health insurance, certain subgroups, such as
foreign-born Mexican Americans have particularly
low rates of coverage. Among foreign-born Mexican
Americans, over 12% report that they have no insur-
ance of any sort. Hispanics, as well as blacks, are also
more likely than non-Hispanic whites to rely on Me-
dicaid or Medicare alone and report that they do not
have private Medigap or supplemental insurance
policies. This lack of private health insurance has
important implications for health care use among
Hispanics because the difference between what Me-
dicare pays and the actual cost of physician and
hospital services can be burdensome, especially for
individuals on fixed incomes.
One of the most obvious reasons for lower rates of
health insurance coverage among Hispanics is their
higher rate of nonparticipation in Social Security. In
1990, only 80% of Hispanics over the age of 65 re-
ported receiving Social Security, compared with 88%
of blacks and 93% of non-Hispanic whites (National
Council of la Raza, 1992). Although these figures may
be exaggerated, they probably reflect significant se-
lective nonparticipation among Hispanics. There are
many other possible reasons for lower rates of non-
participation in Medicare among older Hispanics and
for the lack of private Medigap insurance among
Hispanics generally. For Mexican Americans, citizen-
ship status may represent a barrier (Estrada et al.,
1990). Many older Mexican Americans may never
have become legal residents of the United States. For
those who do not speak English, which is quite com-
mon among older cohorts, access problems may
keep them from seeking medical care or participat-
ing in Social Security (Andersen, Lewis, Giachello,
Aday, &Chiu,1981).
The Consequences of a Lack of Private
Health Insurance
In the United States, an older individual who lacks
private health insurance is dependent on Medicaid
to pay the deductibles and cost sharing charges that
Medicare does not cover (Angel, 1994). In the ab-
sence of private Medigap or supplemental insur-
ance, the coinsurance and deductibles associated
with Medicare can represent significant barriers to
health care (Rowland & Lyons, 1987). For the impov-
erished elderly, Medicaid covers the cost of long-
term care and also provides Medigap insurance cov-
erage that pays the costs that Medicare does not
cover, which can be quite substantial (Feder,
Rowland, Holahan, Salganicoff, & Heslam, 1993). For
example, in 1992, under Medicare part A, which
covers hospital costs, an elderly individual was re-
quired to pay a deductible of $652 and to pay a
portion of the cost of long stays as part of a cost-
sharing provision. Under part B of Medicare, which
covers physician services and ambulatory care, a
person had to pay an annual premium of $382, and a
$100 deductible as well as a 20% copayment. For
individuals with incomes below 100% of poverty,
Medicaid pays the Part B premium and the cost-
sharing part of Part A.
Even with its limited coverage, therefore, Medicaid
provides an important safety net for older Americans
(Rowland, Feder, Lyons, & Salganicoff, 1992). Each
year, large numbers of older persons spend down
their assets and become destitute paying for nursing
home care (Burwell, Adams, & Meiners, 1990). Oth-
ers are poor enough to qualify for assistance from
their initial entry into a long-term care facility (Wie-
ner & Hanley, 1992). For both groups, Medicaid as-
sumes the burden of paying for long-term care
(Burwell et al., 1990; Liu, Doty, & Manton, 1990; Liu &
Manton, 1991; Mor, Intrator, & Laliberte, 1993;
Short, Kemper, Cornelius, & Walden, 1992; Spence
& Wiener, 1990). It is clear that in the absence of the
Medigap coverage provided by Medicaid, more indi-
viduals would forego medical care, and most poor
individuals would have to manage in the community
rather than enter a nursing home when they became
seriously disabled.
The reasons for high rates of nonparticipation in
Medicare by older Mexican Americans are, as yet,
poorly understood. Because most estimates of the
number of uninsured individuals are based on self-
reports of insurance coverage, we cannot even be
sure they reflect the true state of affairs. Yet both
anecdotal evidence and a growing body of empirical
evidence find surprisingly similar levels of nonpartic-
ipation, suggesting that there may be a great deal of
unmet need for health care among elderly Mexican
Americans and other minority elderly individuals in
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 333
the community. Such a possibility has important im-
plications for health care financing reform and for
health care policy generally.
The vast majority of Americans over the age of 65
have private Medigap policies to cover the physician
and hospital charges that Medicare does not pay. For
the most part, this coverage represents the extension
of employer-sponsored plans or privately purchased
Medigap policies. For the majority of retired Ameri-
cans, therefore, their health insurance package con-
sists of Medicare as the core, and supplemental pri-
vate policies. A certain fraction have privately
purchased long-term care insurance policies, al-
though these remain fairly rare. For poor elderly
individuals, their health insurance package consists
of Medicare as the core and Medicaid as the supple-
ment. For those who do not qualify for Medicaid and
who have no private insurance, the alternatives are
limited. Either they must pay for what Medicare does
not cover out of pocket or they must do without
services.
Who Falls Through the Cracks?
The income and health insurance situation of older
individuals is best understood from a life-course per-
spective in which one's economic and insurance situ-
ation in later life is related to the nature and course of
one's working life (Smith, 1995). In the United States
the principal source of health insurance for working-
age individuals and their families is employment. Yet,
many marginal jobs do not provide health insurance,
and a disproportionate number of Hispanics hold
such jobs. In 1990 slightly more than 43% of Hispanics
under the age of 65 had health insurance provided by
an employer or a relative's employer. Among non-
Hispanic whites approximately 70% had employer-
based policies and among blacks, slightly more than
46% had such coverage (National Council of la Raza,
1992). Of course, jobs that do not provide insurance
to working-age individuals are unlikely to provide
coverage to workers once they retire.
The health care safety net, therefore, appears to be
seriously frayed for blacks and certain Hispanic
groups. In what follows, we examine the health in-
surance profile among Hispanics and identify certain
factors that are associated with lower rates of insur-
ance coverage among these groups. As the review of
previous research revealed, there are large differ-
ences between specific nationality groups both in
the extent and type of coverage, as well as in factors
associated with both public and private insurance
coverage. The following analyses are based on the
largest possible sample of Hispanics and include
individuals of all ages. Unfortunately, the number of
Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other Hispan-
ics is simply too small to support separate analyses or
even the estimation of stable coefficients in pooled
analyses. Rather than dropping them from the analy-
sis or pooling them with Mexican Americans for
whom there are sufficient numbers for separate anal-
yses, we treat them as a separate pooled category,
other Hispanics.
Before proceeding, it would be useful to speculate
on the quality of self-reported data concerning
health insurance. For the most part, individuals tend
to know little about the details of their health insur-
ance coverage until they use it. Although we are not
focusing on such details as of copayments or deduct-
ibles, it is likely that many people, even those who
are financially informed, are not fully aware of the
coverage options included in their plans. Nonethe-
less, for present purposes, self-reports provide infor-
mation on broad levels of coverage.
Analytic Approach
In order to assess the extent and type of insurance
coverage among Hispanics, we employ the first wave
of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), a nation-
ally representative longitudinal study of employ-
ment, income, assets, health, and retirement plans
of a sample of pre-retirement age individuals begun
in 1992 (Juster, 1993). The core sample consists of
individuals born between 1931 and 1941 and their
spouses. The total sample consists of 12,654 individ-
uals, including oversamples of 2,064 blacks and 1,174
Hispanics. In addition to much other data, informa-
tion was collected on demographics, physical health
and disability, income amounts and sources, assets,
and health insurance coverage. Information on
employer-based plans, privately purchased plans,
Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans and Civilian
Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Ser-
vices (CHAMPUS) coverage was obtained. A great
deal of information on the nature of the coverage
was also provided by the financially knowledgeable
respondent.
In the following analysis we treat the family as the
unit of analysis. In the vast majority of cases, health
insurance policies cover a worker and his or her
spouse so our approach is to characterize the health
insurance coverage of the insured unit. Although
individuals outside of the target age range of 51 to 61
do not constitute a representative sample of individ-
uals, the households in which they reside are a repre-
sentative sample of households, and in the following
analyses the household is our unit of analysis. We are
also concerned with characteristics of the primary
health insurance plan because the vast majority of
households have either none or one. For couples,
our approach required combining spouse records to
make it possible to relate insurance coverage to
characteristics of both spouses. In the following de-
scriptive analyses, all statistics are weighted to reflect
population level parameters.
We begin our examination of the data by first
examining the basic economic situations of the vari-
ous groups. Table 1 shows that, in comparison to
non-Hispanic white households, Hispanic and black
households have both extremely low assets and low
incomes. This is particularly true for Mexican Ameri-
cans who consistently fare the worst in terms of
health insurance coverage. Female-headed house-
holds are particularly disadvantaged in comparison
to male-headed or couple-headed households.
334 The Gerontologist
Clearly, these disadvantaged groups are unlikely to
be in a position to purchase their own private health
insurance on the open market or to be able to bear
the cost of expensive medical care.
Table 2 presents information on the type of health
insurance coverage reported by the household re-
spondent. Again, the information is presented sepa-
rately for male- or couple-headed households and
for female-headed households. In this and the fol-
lowing analysis we include VA and CHAMPUS cover-
age in the private category, which includes
employer-based coverage. Exploratory analyses re-
vealed that these individuals are similar to those with
private insurance and that there are few enough so
that almost any categorization produces the same
patterns. What is particularly striking in this table is
the high proportion of blacks and Hispanics who
report no health insurance of any sort. Among Mexi-
can Americans, 40% of male or couple-headed
households and nearly 40% of female-headed house-
holds report no health insurance. Again the table
makes it clear that the core of the problem lies in very
low rates of private health insurance. Mexican Amer-
icans are the least likely of any group to be covered

by a private plan or to have employer-based health
insurance. The lack of private health insurance is
associated with a greater reliance by blacks and His-
panics on Medicare and Medicaid. Not surprisingly,
black and Hispanic female-headed households are
particularly dependent on Medicaid.
Table 3 presents information on various aspects of
health care coverage among those who are em-
ployed or who own a health insurance policy. The
statistics are again presented separately for the com-
bined category of male- or couple-headed house-
holds and female-headed households. The first line
in each panel refers to whether or not the employer
offers any retirement health plan. Of course, not all
employers offer a health plan even to their current
employees, and the next sections of the table refer
only to those employees with a plan. The final group
of statistics within each headship panel refer to pri-
vate health insurance the household has purchased
for itself and again only refers to a subset of the total
sample, those with privately purchased coverage.
The statistics in this table reveal certain differences
among aspects of health insurance coverage for the
various groups, but no really clear pattern emerges.
What is again noticeable is that Hispanics are much
less likely than either blacks or non-Hispanic whites
to have private health insurance. They are also less
likely to report that their retirement plan includes
health care coverage. Despite these differences,
however, what this table in conjunction with the
previous table really shows is that although Hispan-
ics may suffer some disadvantage in the type of
insurance they have, the real difference between
Hispanics and other groups is in the likelihood that
they will have health insurance at all. Once one is the
member of an employer-based insurance pool, the

type of coverage one receives is probably pretty
uniform. The big difference between Hispanics and
blacks and non-Hispanic whites, therefore, is in ac-
cess to even basic coverage.
Because it is clear that employment is a major
factor in determining health insurance coverage, in
Tables 4 and 5 we examine the employment charac-
teristics of the various groups, again separately for
male- or couple-headed households and for female-
headed households. Table 4 refers to male- and
couple-headed households and shows that a smaller
fraction of blacks and Hispanics are employed. Em-
ployment among Mexican American wives is particu-
larly low. The table also reveals that a larger fraction
of black and Hispanic husbands report a work-
related disability. Perhaps reflecting their younger
age, a smaller fraction of Hispanic males than either
blacks or non-Hispanic whites are retired.
A rather large fraction of non-Hispanic white males
report t!iat they work more than 40 hours a week, a
pattern that is consistent with a professional lifestyle
and higher incomes. Longer hours can represent
either overtime in blue collar jobs or professional
norms of dedication to a profession. In any case, it is
likely that this pattern reflects white males' greater
access to high quality health insurance. The data on
occupation support this possibility. A larger fraction
of non-Hispanic white males than either blacks or
Hispanics are employed as managers and profession-
als. Indeed only slightly over 7% of Mexican Ameri-
cans are managers or professionals. Conversely, a
larger fraction of blacks and Hispanics than non-
Hispanic whites are employed in protective, health,
personal services, or farming or are unemployed or
in the armed forces. These data, therefore, clearly
show significant occupational differences that are
associated with differential access to health insur-
ance coverage. Table 5, which refers to female-
headed households, reveals similar patterns, but
with lower overall rates of employment for female
heads of household.
These descriptive findings suggest that lower em-
ployment rates, as well as employment in jobs that
may not provide health insurance at least partially
account for differences between Hispanics and non-
Hispanic whites. In order to test the extent to which
lower black and Hispanic insurance rates are ex-
plained by other insurance-related economic and
household factors, we employ a multinomial logistic
regression in which the dependent variable is a four-
category descriptor of the household insurance pro-
file. The four categories are: (1) private or employer
based insurance (including VA and CHAMPUS); (2)
public insurance only, which includes Medicare or
Medicaid; (3) both private or employer and public
insurance; and (4) no insurance at all. In order to
account for all possible differences between black,
Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white households, we
include a large number of insurance-related vari-
ables as well as other characteristics of the husband
and wife. These include race and Hispanic ethnicity
(Mexican American and other Hispanic), age, educa-
tion, and nativity status of the household head,
household income, employment status of the hus-
band and wife, the disability status of both husband
and wife, the retirement status of both husband and

wife, the hours worked for husband and wife, the
general health of the husband and wife, the presence
of a disabling health condition for both husband and
wife, the log of the number of problems with physi-
cal activities of daily living, and occupation of the
household head. The occupational categories are
professional/managerial; sales, clerical, and admin-
istrative; service, cleaning and food preparation;
protective services, health, and farming; mechani-
cal, construction, and self-employed. In the multino-
mial regression, the reference for these categories is
unemployed. Dummy variables are included to indi-
cate missing data on each variable for both the hus-
band and wife.
In Table 6, the reference category is having no
insurance, and each of the equations expresses the
probability of having each of the first three types of
insurance as opposed to none. In these models, a
negative coefficient reflects an increased likelihood
of having no insurance as opposed to having each of
the other three combinations. Because female-
headed households are so different from couple-
headed households, these models refer only to cou-
ples. The basic patterns that emerge for single female
heads, however, are basically similar to those for
couples. Because the entire model contains a large
number of coefficients, only those that are signifi-
cant are presented.
Our only real objective in this table is to determine
if this large group of insurance-related variables ac-
counts for differences in insurance coverage be-
tween the various groups. The model indicates that,
after controlling for the other insurance-related fac-
tors, there is no statistically significant difference

between non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the
probability of any form of insurance coverage. For
Hispanics, however, the situation is entirely differ-
ent. Even after controlling for the large number of
insurance-related correlates, Mexican Americans are
still much less likely than non-Hispanic whites or

Discussion
The Health and Retirement Study, therefore, adds
another piece of evidence to a growing body of
literature that shows extremely low levels of health
insurance coverage among Hispanics and especially
among Mexican Americans. This serious lack of in-
surance in the years prior to retirement means that a
large fraction of Hispanics will have no supplemental
insurance once they do retire. Individuals who are
inadequately insured prior to retirement are unlikely
to be any better off after retirement. In light of the
substantial burden that the copayments and deducti-
bles associated with Medicare can represent for indi-
viduals on a limited income, this trend suggests that a
large proportion of older Hispanics may have only
minimal coverage (Rowland & Lyons, 1987). Evidence
we cited earlier indicates that a larger fraction of
Hispanics than non-Hispanics do not participate in
Medicare, and it may well be that cost is a major
reason.
At a very practical level, this lack of insurance has
serious consequences for health because the lack of
health insurance is a major barrier to obtaining nec-
essary medical care (Aday, Andersen, & Fleming,
1980). Between 1985 and 1990, the number of unin-
sured Hispanics increased at the same time that the
number of uninsured blacks and non-Hispanic
whites decreased (National Council of la Raza, 1992).
The increasing fiscal crisis in health care and the
restrictions to access that are likely to be put in place
to deal with it can only make this situation worse.
Because we do not have universal public health care
coverage in the United States, employment is the
major source of health insurance for working-age
individuals and their families. For the poor, Medicaid
serves as the health care safety net. For the working
poor who hold jobs that do not provide health insur-
ance and who do not qualify for Medicaid, there are
few alternatives. For those whose incomes must be
used for basic subsistence, medical care is often a
luxury or something that can only be obtained as
charity.
The tie between employment and health insurance
is clearly the major factor in determining low rates of
insurance coverage among blacks and Hispanics
and, especially, among Mexican Americans. The HRS
data clearly show low rates of insurance associated
with employment disadvantages for all groups. Yet,
even after controlling for employment status, Mexi-
can Americans still have lower levels of health insur-
ance coverage than either non-Hispanic blacks or
whites. The reasons for this remain unclear. Numer-
ous barriers to health care have been identified
among Hispanics, including language difficulties,
cultural distance between provider and patient, and
a greater reliance on local networks of friends and
relatives (Markides, Levin, & Ray, 1985; Valdez,
1993). To the extent that these factors reduce medical
care use, they may also reduce health insurance
coverage. For individuals without a great deal of
control over their lives, the very concept of insur-
ance may seem foreign. For the poor, health insur-
ance is, after all, a luxury that must take a back seat to
more basic survival needs. For those with little in-
come and no employer-based coverage, a fatalistic
view of health and health care is not unrealistic.
Older, traditionally oriented Hispanics are members
of cohorts that simply did not expect to be insured
for health care, and both cultural expectations and
reference group factors may lower participation even
in universal programs like Medicare. Future research
will have to focus on the specific cultural, organiza-
tional, and personal factors associated with the
greatly lowered Hispanic health insurance coverage
documented here. As we move into a managed care
environment, understanding both financial and non-
financial barriers to health care for Hispanics be-
comes ever more important.
Unfortunately, although the total oversample of
Hispanics in the HRS is large, the number of Hispanic
households with complete insurance information is
much smaller, and the amount of missing informa-
tion on other variables further reduces the effective
sample size for multivariate analyses. What would be
of particular use would be a close examination of
nationality differences among Hispanics and the abil-
ity to relate those to nativity, migration history, and
state of residence, as well as to detailed health status.
The HRS data further our appreciation of the impor-
tant differences between specific Hispanic national-
ity groups. Our analyses revealed large differences
between Mexican Americans and other Hispanics.
Clearly, the possibility of a more detailed analysis of
Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and other national-
ity groups would be a welcome addition.
Future waves of the HRS will allow us to answer
some very interesting questions concerning the tran-
sition from work to retirement and its association
with health among Hispanics. They will also make it
possible to examine changes in health insurance
coverage as one moves from work to retirement.
Wave one, however, clearly sets the stage by show-
ing us the magnitude of the difference between the
extent of health insurance coverage among Hispan-
ics, blacks, and non-Hispanic whites. Even if a por-
tion of the difference is due to reporting error, these
data clearly identify a growing social problem that we
will have to address in the years to come. Attempts at
containing the cost of Medicare can only further
harm a group of individuals who have very limited
resources with which to cope.
