PEOPLE WITH THE METABOLIC
syndrome are at increased risk
for developing diabetes melli-
tus1 and cardiovascular dis-
ease2 as well as increased mortality from
cardiovascular disease and all causes.3
The recently released Third Report of
theNationalCholesterolEducationPro-
gram Expert Panel on Detection, Evalu-
ation, and Treatment of High Blood
Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treat-
ment Panel III) (ATP III) draws atten-
tion to the importance of the meta-
bolic syndrome and provides a working
definition of this syndrome for the first
time.4 The prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome as defined by ATP III
in the United States is unknown. Be-
cause the implications of the meta-
bolic syndrome for health care are sub-
stantial, we sought to establish the
prevalence of this condition.
METHODS
Between 1988 and 1994, a representa-
tive sample of the civilian noninstitu-
tionalized US population was re-
cruited into the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) using a multistage, strati-
fied sampling design.5,6 After an inter-
view in the home, participants were in-
vited to attend 1 of 3 examination
sessions: morning, afternoon, or
evening.
As detailed in the ATP III report, par-
ticipants having 3 or more of the fol-
lowing criteria were defined as having
the metabolic syndrome:
1. Abdominal obesity: waist circum-
ference 102 cm in men and 88 cm
in women;

Context The Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel
on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III)
highlights the importance of treating patients with the metabolic syndrome to pre-
vent cardiovascular disease. Limited information is available about the prevalence of
the metabolic syndrome in the United States, however.
Objective To estimate the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in the United States
as defined by the ATP III report.
Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data on 8814 men and women aged
20 years or older from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1988-1994), a cross-sectional health survey of a nationally representative sample of
the noninstitutionalized civilian US population.
Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome as defined by
ATP III (3 of the following abnormalities): waist circumference greater than 102 cm
in men and 88 cm in women; serum triglycerides level of at least 150 mg/dL (1.69
mmol/L); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L)
in men and 50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in women; blood pressure of at least 130/85
mm Hg; or serum glucose level of at least 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L).
Results The unadjusted and age-adjusted prevalences of the metabolic syndrome
were 21.8% and 23.7%, respectively. The prevalence increased from 6.7% among
participants aged 20 through 29 years to 43.5% and 42.0% for participants aged 60
through 69 years and aged at least 70 years, respectively. Mexican Americans had the
highest age-adjusted prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (31.9%). The age-
adjusted prevalence was similar for men (24.0%) and women (23.4%). However, among
African Americans, women had about a 57% higher prevalence than men did and
among Mexican Americans, women had about a 26% higher prevalence than men
did. Using 2000 census data, about 47 million US residents have the metabolic syn-
drome.
Conclusions These results from a representative sample of US adults show that the
metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent. The large numbers of US residents with the
metabolic syndrome may have important implications for the health care sector.

2. Hypertriglyceridemia: 150
mg/dL (1.69 mmol/L);
3. Low high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol: 40 mg/dL (1.04
mmol/L) in men and 50 mg/dL (1.29
mmol/L) in women;
4. High blood pressure: 130/85
mm Hg;
5. High fasting glucose: 110 mg/dL
(6.1 mmol/L).
We counted participants who re-
ported currently using antihyperten-
sive or antidiabetic medication (insu-
lin or oral agents) as participants with
high blood pressure or diabetes, re-
spectively. Serum triglycerides were
measured enzymatically after hydroly-
zation to glycerol (Hitachi 704 Ana-
lyzer; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). High-
density lipoprotein cholesterol was
measured following the precipitation of
other lipoproteins with a heparin-
manganese chloride mixture (Hitachi
704 Analyzer). Serum glucose concen-
tration was measured using an enzy-
matic reaction (Cobas Mira assay;
Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Details
about the laboratory procedures of all
these tests are published elsewhere.6
Three blood pressure readings were ob-
tained in the mobile examination cen-
ter. The average of the second and third
systolic and diastolic blood pressure
readings were used in the analyses.
For men and nonpregnant women
aged at least 20 years who attended the
medical examination and who had
fasted at least 8 hours, we calculated the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
by age, sex, and race or ethnicity (white,
African American, Mexican Ameri-
can, other). We calculated estimates us-
ing the sampling weights so that the es-
timates are representative of the civilian
noninstitutionalized US population. All
analyses were done by using SUDAAN
to obtain proper variance estimates be-
cause of the complex sampling de-
sign.7
RESULTS
Among men, whites and Mexican
Americans had the highest age-
adjusted prevalences of abdominal obe-
sity, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL
cholesterol concentration (TABLE 1).
African American men had the high-
est age-adjusted prevalence of hyper-
tension, and Mexican American men
had the highest age-adjusted preva-
lenceofhyperglycemia.Amongwomen,
Mexican Americans and African Ameri-
cans had the highest age-adjusted
prevalence of abdominal obesity. Afri-
can American women had the highest
age-adjusted prevalence of high blood
pressure, and Mexican American
women had the highest age-adjusted
prevalences of hypertriglyceridemia,
low HDL cholesterol concentration, and
hyperglycemia.
Overall, the unadjusted and age-
adjusted prevalences of the metabolic
syndrome were 21.8% and 23.7%, re-
spectively (TABLE 2). The prevalence in-
creased from 6.7% among partici-
pants aged 20 through 29 years to
43.5% and 42.0% for participants aged
60 through 69 years and 70 years or
older, respectively (FIGURE 1). The
prevalence differed little among men
(24.0%) and women (23.4%). It was
highest among Mexican Americans
(31.9%) and lowest among whites
(23.8%), African Americans (21.6%),
and people reporting an "other" race or
ethnicity (20.3%). Among whites and
participants of the other race or ethnic
group, men and women had a similar
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
(FIGURE 2). Among African Ameri-
cans, women had about a 57% higher
prevalence than men did. Among Mexi-

can Americans, women had about a
26% higher prevalence than men did.
Application of the age-specific preva-
lence rates to US census counts from
2000 suggests that 47 million US resi-
dents have the metabolic syndrome.
COMMENT
Using ATP III's new definition, we es-
timate that approximately 22% of US
adults (24% after age adjustment) have
the metabolic syndrome. Previous es-
timates of the prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome in the United States and
Europe have differed because of differ-
ences in definitions and populations
studied.2,8-16 The unrelenting increase
in the prevalence of obesity in the
United States17 suggests that the cur-
rent prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome is now very likely higher than
that estimated from 1988-1994
NHANES III data. Even if prevalence
rates remained unchanged, the total
number of people with the metabolic
syndrome would have increased be-
cause of population growth during the
1990s.
Insulin resistance is thought to be an
underlying feature of the metabolic syn-
drome.18 Genetic abnormalities, fetal
malnutrition, and visceral adiposity may
play roles in the pathophysiology of in-
sulin resistance and the metabolic syn-
drome.19 Although insulin resistance
amongpatientswiththeindividualcom-
ponents of the metabolic syndrome is
common, significant proportions of
these patients do not have insulin resis-
tance. Some studies have suggested that
hypertensionisnotstronglylinkedtothe
metabolic syndrome.20
The cornerstones of treatment are the
management of weight and ensuring ap-
propriate levels of physical activity. Re-
cent studies demonstrate that dietary
modification and enhanced physical ac-
tivity may delay or prevent the transi-
tion from impaired glucose tolerance to
type 2 diabetes mellitus and provide rel-
evant treatment paradigms for patients
with the metabolic syndrome.21-23 While

normalities of this syndrome can re-

duce morbidity and mortality, it seems
unlikely that management of the indi-
vidual abnormalities of this syndrome
provides better outcomes than a more
integrated strategy.
Education and training will be criti-
cal to ensure that health care provid-
ers have the knowledge and skills nec-
essary to properly treat patients with the
metabolic syndrome. Lack of reim-
bursement for weight management and
physical activity interventions consti-
tutes a major barrier. Significant ef-
forts are needed to close the gap be-
tween current and desirable practice
patterns.
The high prevalence of this condi-
tion may also have serious implica-
tions for US health care costs. Thus,
studies of the direct medical costs as-
sociated with the metabolic syndrome
are urgently needed. Because the root
causes of the metabolic syndrome for
the overwhelming majority of pa-
tients are improper nutrition and in-
adequate physical activity, the high
prevalence of this syndrome under-
scores the urgent need to develop com-
prehensive efforts directed at control-
lingtheobesityepidemicandimproving
physical activity levels in the United
States.
