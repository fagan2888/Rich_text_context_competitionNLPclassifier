Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
(PHDCN), neighborhood and individual-level predictors of secondary exposure to
violence were assessed. Secondary exposure to violence is defined as witnessing
and/or hearing violent acts, as opposed to being a victim of violence directly. A
substantial amount of between neighborhood variance was accounted for by
individual-level variables including gender, race/ethnicity, age, low self-control,
and prior delinquent involvement. At the neighborhood level, concentrated
disadvantage and immigrant concentration were both related to exposure to
secondary violence. Specifically, children and adolescents living in more
disadvantaged contexts witness and hear violence at higher rates than those
living in less disadvantaged contexts. Also, those living in areas with a higher
concentration of immigrants are exposed to secondary violence at higher rates

youth services within neighborhoods served as a protective factor against expo-
sure. Results suggest a need to target multiple neighborhood and individual
correlates simultaneously to reduce secondary violence exposure among children
and adolescents. Directions for future research are discussed.

Introduction
Over the past decade, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports that violent
victimizationagainstchildrenandadolescentsintheUnitedStateshasbeendeclin-
ing (Klaus & Rennison, 2002). American youth, however, still experience high levels
of violence compared to many other age groups (Centers for Disease Control [CDC],
2000). In fact, those between the ages of 12 and 17 have historically had the highest
ratesofviolentvictimizationcomparedtootheragegroups(Rennison,2002).While
violent victimization of youth has been a topic of much empirical research
(Lauritsen,Laub,&Sampson,1992;Piquero&Hickman,2003;Piquero,MacDonald,
Dobrin, Daigle, & Cullen, 2005; Schreck, 1999; Schreck, Stewart, & Fisher, 2006;
Schreck, Wright, & Miller, 2002; Stewart, Sterk, & Elifson, 2004), youth in the
United States are vulnerable to other forms of violence that are also important
due to the adverse consequences related to them (see Buka, Stichick, Birdthistle,
& Earls, 2001). One of these is secondary exposure to violence defined as witnessing
or hearing violence, as opposed to primary violence, i.e., being the victim of a
physically violent act (Buka et al., 2001). Examples of secondary exposure include,
but are not limited to, witnessing someone being shot, murdered, and attacked
and hearing gun shots. The current study concentrates on secondary exposures
that children and adolescents experience in the neighborhoods they live.
In July 2002, several federal agencies including the Center of Disease Control,
the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Justice spon-
sored an extensive workshop titled, "Children Exposed to Violence: Current
Status, Gaps, and Research Priorities." Violence researchers from around the
United States convened to discuss the gaps in knowledge and what future
research priorities should be regarding children's exposure to various types of
violence. One conclusion was that understanding pathways of exposure to
community violence is vital to curb the effects it can have on children. During
this workshop researchers identified several negative consequences of exposure
to violence including post traumatic stress disorder and psychobiological
outcomes that manifest in changes to physiological arousal (e.g., high blood pres-
sure and cortisol production). They also concluded that community exposure to
violence is associated with negative behavioral outcomes such as aggression,
antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. Given these consequences, it is impor-
tant to understand the contextual and individual-level risk factors that are
32 GIBSON ET AL.
related to the frequency of neighborhood exposure to violence. However, no
studies have yet empirically addressed both neighborhood and individual risk
factors in the same study, primarily due to data restrictions and designs that have
not allowed for these investigations (e.g., children nested in many neighborhoods
and reliable measures of structural and social processes of neighborhoods
combined with individual measures of families and children living in neighbor-
hoods). In turn, such restrictions make it difficult to disentangle the competing
effects of neighborhood characteristics versus individual characteristics on
secondary exposure to violence, consequently leading to an incomplete set of
findings for informing intervention and preventions practices. In sum, we know
little about if and how neighborhoods in which children live influence their
frequency of exposure above and beyond individual characteristics (Buka et al.,
2001). Researchers have identified several individual correlates of exposure but
have largely done so without accounting for the contexts in which children reside.
We now have considerable knowledge about the individual factors contributing
to violent victimization (Christiansen & Evans, 2005; Esbensen & Huizinga, 1991;
Haynie & Piquero, 2006; Lauritsen et al., 1992; Menard, 2002; Schreck, Fisher &
Miller, 2004 Snyder & Sickmund, 1999), but our understanding of the broader
impacts of violence--and how communities contribute to them--is far more
limited (see Lauritsen, 2001; Lauritsen et al., 1992; Selner-O'Hagan, Kindlon,
Buyka, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1998; Stewart, Schreck, & Simons, 2006), notwith-
standing the calls from some researchers to give greater attention to studying
secondary violence (Buka et al., 2001). Scholars have made calls to target the
environments in which children live to alleviate violence exposure and the result-
ing negative consequences (Luther & Goldstein, 2004; Sullivan, Kung, & Farrell,
2004), but such calls do not appear to be empirically grounded in research that
indicates structural and social aspects of neighborhoods are any more important
than individual risk factors.
It is logical to suspect that neighborhood factors contribute to violence expo-
sure, as much research has found a link between neighborhood conditions and
violent crime (Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997). Community factors, like
poverty and lack of social cohesion within neighborhoods, may create a context
laden with risk for children independent of individual action and individual
protective factors. For instance, an individual may possess a number of
different traits and characteristics that decreases their risk of being exposed
but may still witness and hear violence if the community structure facilitates
high levels of violence.1 Moreover, a person's behavior may be bounded by the
structural characteristics of the local community. For instance, recent research
1. Several explanations have been put forth as mechanisms to explain why children and adolescents
experience violence (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000). Jencks and Mayer (1990) identified several
theoretical frameworks for linking adverse child and adolescent outcomes to neighborhood conditions.
Forinstance,collectivesocializationmodels,suggestthatneighborhoodsinfluencechildrenandadoles-
cents through community social organization, control, and collective efficacy, including the presence
of adult role models and social control agents who, in addition to structuring routines and opportunities
in the neighborhood, supervise and monitor children and adolescents in the neighborhood.
SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE DURING CHILDHOOD 33
has shown that in structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods adolescents and
children adopt what Anderson (1999) identifies as the "code of the streets"
where they are willing to engage in violence or show their toughness to gain
respect among others in their neighborhood so that they are less vulnerable to
violent attacks (i.e., Baumer, Horney, Felson, & Lauritsen, 2003; Stewart et al.,
2006). Recent research, however, shows evidence supporting the opposite in
that kids who adopt the "street code" are at an increased risk for becoming
violently victimized, especially for those residing in increasingly more violent
neighborhoods. This could perhaps also explain why some kids are at an
increased risk for witnessing and hearing violence in disadvantage neighbor-
hoods.2 In sum, it is important to understand how neighborhood conditions
directly facilitate and ameliorate risk for exposure, above and beyond individual
risk.
A growing body of research does support the fact that particular characteris-
tics of youth are correlated with experiencing secondary violence. These charac-
teristics include gender, race, age, socioeconomic status, and even behavioral
and parenting characteristics (for a review see Buka et al., 2001). Unfortunately,
studies on secondary exposure to violence rarely move beyond such characteris-
tics. Therefore, this study will also identify an additional, potential risk factor
for exposure, i.e., low self-control, which predicts personal victimization and
involvement in delinquency (Pratt & Cullen, 2000; Schreck, 1999; Stewart et al,
2004), but, to our knowledge, has not been implemented in research on second-
ary exposure to violence. Ultimately, identifying additional risk factors and
making adjustments for them will aid in isolating whether neighborhood effects
do exist.
To address gaps in extant research, the current study uses data from waves 1
and 2 of the longitudinal cohort study (i.e., 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old cohorts) of
the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) to assess
if and how characteristics of neighborhoods where children reside matter in
their secondary exposures to violence within their neighborhoods. Data were
collected on children and adolescents residing within socially, racially, and
economically diverse neighborhoods of Chicago. Exploiting the nested data
structure of the PHDCN by estimating a series of multilevel models, we were
able to identify the influences of neighborhood characteristics on exposure
which indicate that some structural dimensions of neighborhoods, as well as the
presence of youth organizations, are important for explaining secondary
exposure. Before discussing these data and our results, we define secondary
exposure to violence, discuss its prevalence and consequences, how individual
and neighborhood characteristics can be important determinates of exposure,
and then point to limitations of past contextual research.
2. While Anderson's (1999) hypothesis regarding the "code of the streets" and violence exposure
could be a possible explanation as to why we might expect a correlation between neighborhood
conditions and exposure to secondary violence, this hypothesis is beyond the scope of the current
study, and we encourage other researchers to directly examine this possibility.

Defining Types of Exposure to Violence
Exposure to violence has traditionally been separated by two primary catego-
ries: direct and indirect exposure (Martin, Gordon, & Kupersmith, 1995;
Osofsky, Wewers, Hann, & Fick, 1993; Richters & Martinez, 1993). Direct expo-
sure, or personal violent victimization, is defined by purposeful acts of others to
cause injury, such as being a victim of a shooting, stabbing, being robbed, or
threatened. Indirect or secondary exposure entails witnessing, and even hear-
ing, acts of violence. Although some definitions of secondary exposure are
inconsistent, studies often refer to eye-witnessing acts such as murder, assault,
shootings, or threats of violence, while others have included hearing violent
events such as gunshots. Buka and colleagues (2001) have recently redefined
this construct by categorizing different levels of exposure that include primary,
i.e., personal victimization, secondary, i.e., violence seen or heard, and
tertiary exposures, i.e., learning of violence experienced by others such as
friends of family members. While much is already known about predictors and
consequences of primary exposures (Christiansen & Evans, 2005; Esbensen &
Huizinga, 1991; Haynie & Piquero, 2006; Lauritsen et al., 1992; Loeber, Kalb, &
Huizinga, 2001; Menard, 2002; Schreck, 1999; Snyder & Sickmund, 1999), the
same cannot be said for secondary exposures that children and adolescents
experience in their neighborhoods.
Secondary Exposure to Violence: Prevalence and Consequences
Studies indicate that youth experience various types and amounts of secondary
violence in their communities. For instance, some studies report that up to
47 percent of low income Black children to 1 percent of middle to upper class
White children witnessed a murder. Further, studies show that 9 percent to
54 percent of children have witnessed a stabbing in their life time and that
4 percent to 70 percent have witnessed a shooting (Fitzpatrick, 1997; Gladstein,
Rusonis, & Heald, 1992). Prevalence estimates of these most studied forms vary
as a function of who is reporting the exposure (i.e., child self-report vs. paren-
tal reports of child exposure), sampling characteristics (low income inner city
youth vs. middle class Caucasian youth), and measuring instruments (Buka
et al., 2001). Exposure to violence is also cumulative in that children and
adolescents witnessing any particular act of violence are more likely to witness
other acts (Bell & Jenkins, 1993; Kindlon, Wright, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1996);
therefore, making it difficult to isolate exposures with the greatest potential for
adverse affects on children.
There is a growing recognition of the link between secondary violence expo-
sure and a range of negative behavioral, mental, and physical health outcomes.
Studies conducted in the last two decades have found that secondary violence
experienced during childhood and adolescence is related to increases in
emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, and post traumatic stress
SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE DURING CHILDHOOD 35
disorder (Fitzpatrick, 1993), aggression and violent behavior (Bell & Jenkins,
1993; DuRant, Pendergrast, & Cadenhead, 1994; Gorman-Smith & Tolan, 1998),
substance abuse (Gilvarry, 2000), lack of empathy, decreased academic perfor-
mance, and heart rate and sleeping disturbances (see Buka et al., 2001). As
such, it is important to appropriately identify and understand the multilayered
risks so that adverse consequences can be minimized.
Individual-Level Risk Factors
It is fair to say that individual characteristics are likely the most studied
correlates of secondary violence exposure. For instance, several demographic
characteristics have been identified that are related to experiencing secondary
violence. These factors include gender, race, age, and socioeconomic status
(SES). In summary, males are more likely than females to be exposed to higher
levels of secondary violence (Fitzpatrick & Boldizar, 1993; Selner-O'Hagan
et al., 1998). Blacks are more likely than Whites and Hispanics to experience
secondary exposure to violence, and Hispanics are more likely than Whites to
experience secondary exposures (Gladstein et al., 1992; Martin et al., 1995).
Generally, older youth are more likely than younger youth to experience second-
ary exposures to violence (Richters & Marinez, 1993; Selner-O'Hagan et al.,
1998; but cf. Fitzpatrick & Boldizar, 1993), although some studies do not find a
relationship between levels of exposure and age. Youth from lower socioeco-
nomic backgrounds and those living in poorer neighborhoods compared to their
counterparts report the highest rates of secondary violence exposure (Campbell
& Schwartz, 1996; Fitzpatrick, 1997; Moses, 1999). Parenting characteristics
have also been implemented in predicting secondary exposure to violence;
however, these studies are less consistent in their effects (Gorman-Smith &
Tolan, 1998) and some scholars even argue that parenting variables work as
moderators instead of having direct effects on exposure (see Buka et al., 2001).
For instance, some studies reveal that factors which describe parent-child rela-
tions such as monitoring, conflict, and involvement do not predict exposure
(Miller, Wasserman, Neugebauer, Gorman-Smith, & Kamboukos, 1999), while
others conclude that parental supervision/monitoring and support can (Gorman-
Smith, Henry, & Tolan, 2004; Luther & Goldstein, 2004). Other studies show that
behavioral problems, especially antisocial and delinquent behaviors, put youth
at an increased risk for experiencing secondary violence (Kuo, Mohler,
Raudenbush, & Earls, 2000; Selner-O'Hagan et al., 1998), but it is unclear
whether these relationships are causal because both have also been studied as
outcomes of exposure.
Seldom has research moved beyond individual factors discussed above when
predicting secondary exposure to violence among children and adolescents.
We believe that factors known to predict involvement in delinquent/criminal
lifestyles and personal victimization may have implications for explaining
secondary exposure to violence. In particular, low self-control increases the
36 GIBSON ET AL.
likelihood that individuals will engage in delinquency (Pratt & Cullen, 2000),
become victims of violent crime (Schreck, 1999), and select into risky envi-
ronments/situations that have a high likelihood for violence to occur (Schreck
et al., 2006).
Those with low self-control have a tendency to prefer instant gratification
that brings pleasure and excitement immediately while failing to carefully plan
and seriously think about the consequences of their actions. According to
Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990), low self-control is due to a lack of parental
socialization, disciplining, and monitoring in that parents who do not recognize
bad behaviors, do not give adequate supervision, and punish erratically and
inconsistently will encourage their child's impulsive and instantly gratifying
behaviors, ultimately resulting in a child lacking self-control. Furthermore, they
argue that such aversive parenting styles that promote low self-control are more
likely to manifest if primary caregivers or parents lack warmth and affection.
Beyond evidence of the negative consequences related to low self-control
(Pratt & Cullen, 2000), we argue that a measure of this trait is important to
include when investigating the link between neighborhoods and the etiology of
secondary violence exposure for two reasons. First, an argument for a relation-
ship between low self-control and secondary exposure to violence is largely due
to recent theoretical and empirical work that assesses how and why low self-
control predicts violent victimization among youth. Several studies have shown
that the likelihood of primary exposure to violence (i.e., personal victimization)
is increased for those possessing low self-control and that such individuals
are at risk for being victimized over and over again (Schreck, 1999; Stewart,
Elifson, & Sterk, 2004). Those with low self-control may continue to be violently
victimized due to the fact that they resist curbing their involvement in risky
lifestyles (e.g., delinquency, drug use, hanging around delinquent peers) even
after they experience primary exposures to violence (Schreck et al., 2006).
Research linking low self-control to personal victimization is not too surprising
because those who have low self-control tend to create danger for themselves
through mingling with others who are motivated to offend and often hanging
out in risky situations that have a high probability of crime and victimization
occurrences.
We believe that evidence linking low self-control to primary exposure to
violence is applicable to witnessing and hearing violence. Those with low self-
control tend to hang out with deviant peers or people who are motivated to offend
and use drugs (Schreck et al., 2006). Since we know that deviants offend and
suffer more victimization, it would naturally follow that those with low self-
control (compared to high self-control youth) will be likely to have more exposure
to secondary violence due to the fact that they hang out with individuals who
experience more violent victimization. Furthermore, individuals who possess low
self-control tend to hang out in "high risk" settings which may facilitate seeing
and hearing violence take place even when they are not an active participant.
Second, including a measure of low self-control is important when investigat-
ing the effects of neighborhood conditions on witnessing and hearing violence so
SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE DURING CHILDHOOD 37
that selection effects are less problematic. That is, we must take into account
individual risk factors that could potentially account for a link between
structural and social factors of neighborhoods and secondary violence exposure.
Children and adolescents who live in disadvantaged neighborhoods may have
higher rates of violence exposure due to the possibility that they, on average,
have lower self-control. In an assessment of neighborhood influences on child
and adolescent development, Wikström and Sampson (2003) specifically argue
that self-control of youth is partially influenced by community socialization and
that this impact is due to the level of collective efficacy present in a neighbor-
hood. Structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods are likely to have lower levels
of informal controls and residents are less likely to look after kids in a neighbor-
hood. This is likely related to the frequency in which children experience behav-
ioral settings disadvantageous to the development of self-control. Specifically,
children living in neighborhoods low in child-based collective efficacy are
expected to encounter behavioral settings that provide less support and moni-
toring of their behaviors. Following the above logic, if self-control is not taken
into account we risk mis-specifying a model specifically created to estimate
neighborhood effects on children and adolescents exposure to secondary
violence.
Neighborhood Influences
While studies have produced somewhat consistent findings on individual risk
factors, the same cannot be said for the role of neighborhood variables in
children and adolescents secondary exposure. In fact, Buka and his colleagues
(2001) recently concluded that neighborhood influences on exposure to
violence, compared to family and individual correlates, are poorly understood.
The few studies that have assessed community risk factors assess structural
aspects such as poverty rates and racial/ethnic composition of neighborhoods in
which children live (Fitzpatrick & Boldizar, 1993; Selner-O'Hagan et al., 1998).
These studies typically find that children living in lower income, urban environ-
ments have higher levels of exposure to secondary violence when compared to
other children.
While community/neighborhood studies are few, as well as mixed and limited
methodologically, scholars continually advocate for a focus on alleviating
community risk so that consequences of exposure to violence can be reduced.
For instance, a recent special issue of the Journal of Clinical Child and Adoles-
cent Psychology [2004, Vol. 33, No.3] was devoted to children's exposure to
violence. As such, several scholars make statements about the importance of
targeting communities for intervention and prevention. Sullivan and his
colleagues (2004) argue that prevention efforts must be made to reduce
violence within communities, while Luther and Goldstein (2004) indicate that
efforts should focus on the environment rather than the individual who is
exposed. Further, Luther and Goldstein (2004) argue that social scientists have
38 GIBSON ET AL.
a responsibility to improve the environments that pose exposure risk for
children. Unfortunately, as will be discussed, studies that could be used to
advocate such approaches have been ill-equipped to disentangle the effects of
the community/environment from the individual-level characteristics that could
put children at risk. Therefore, it is not only important to employ appropriate
data and statistical models, but it is also important to identify contextual
factors that could be related to exposure to secondary violence.
It is well known that neighborhoods are believed to influence the development
of children and the experiences they are subjected to (Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, &
Aber, 1997; Jencks & Mayer, 1990; Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000). According
to those who study developmental processes, neighborhood influences are part
of an ecological model in which individuals are viewed in the context of a series
of environments (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Focusing on community or neighbor-
hood conditions does make sense for explaining secondary exposure to violence,
especially given the fact that a long line of criminological research has shown
that some urban neighborhoods have markedly higher levels of violent crime than
others (Sampson et al., 1997; Shaw & McKay, 1942). Social disorganization theory
and its recent advances have been at the forefront of this discussion. As early as
the 1940s, Shaw and McKay found that neighborhoods with high poverty, racial
and ethnic heterogeneity, and residential mobility had higher crime rates. They
theorized that when neighborhoods were fraught with such characteristics the
likelihood of bond formation between neighbors would be unlikely, thus limiting
a neighborhood's ability to control crime and disorder. For instance, neighbor-
hoods with high residential mobility limits the likelihood that local residents will
get to know each other and discuss neighborhood goals.
A number of scholars have advanced Shaw and McKay's theory by articulating
and measuring intervening factors that weaken a neighborhood's ability to control
crime (e.g., Bursik & Grasmick, 1993; Kornhauser, 1978; Sampson et al., 1997;
Smith & Jarjoura, 1989). Perhaps one of the most important developments of
intervening mechanisms is the development and measurement of the concept
collective efficacy (Sampson et al., 1997). Conceptually, collective efficacy is
defined as the expectation on the part of residents that they should contribute
toward the common good of their neighborhood. According to Sampson et al.
(1997), collective efficacy consists of two correlated dimensions. First, it is the
willingness of residents to exercise informal social control and intervene for the
common good of the neighborhood (e.g., kids loitering outside while truant, paint-
ing graffiti). Second is social cohesion and trust among local residents where they
collectively approve of sentiments such as "neighbors help each other," "this is
a close knit neighborhood," and "people in this neighborhood generally get along."
Studies have found that neighborhoods high in collective efficacy have less violent
crime, children with fewer internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems,
and healthier residents (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Sampson et al., 1997).
Furthermore, Sampson and colleagues (1999) identified three components for
collective efficacy directed towards children that they suggest will impact devel-
opment, including intergenerational closure, reciprocal exchange, and social
SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE DURING CHILDHOOD 39
control. Intergenerational closure speaks to the closeness of parents and children
within a community, and it is argued that this closeness is important for neigh-
borhood control of children beyond parental childrearing practices and monitoring
by providing social support, information to parents, and help in facilitating
control. Reciprocal exchange is the interaction of families with respect to chil-
drearing. Such exchanges can span from advice, material goods, and information
about childrearing. Finally, child-centered social control relates to the willingness
of residents to intervene if neighborhood children are getting into trouble or up
to no good, beyond intervention by a child's parents (Sampson et al., 1999). Such
neighborhood phenomenon are not only related to violent crime--those having
higher amounts of child-based collective efficacy have less violent crime--but we,
as well as others (Luther & Goldstein, 2004) believe that they can influence
secondary violence exposure among children and adolescents. As such they are
considered protective factors that promote safety and concern for neighborhood
children. Neighborhood social processes such as these may also perhaps mitigate
violence in communities (Luther & Goldstein, 2004; Sampson et al., 1997).
Research on Secondary Exposure to Violence: What Do We Not Know?
After reviewing studies on secondary exposure to violence among children and
adolescents there are many things we do not know about who is more likely to
experience higher rates of exposures. First, we do not know if and how
neighborhoods will determine whether children and adolescents are at risk for
exposure to secondary violence when taking into account individual risk factors.
Studieshavebeensuccessfulatassessingexposureamongsamplesofyouthresiding
in one, as opposed to various, neighborhoods. Studies have also been successful
at making dichotomous comparisons between urban or suburban environments,
but they did not compare many youth residing across many diverse neighborhood
contexts. Studies designed as such were unable to partition the variance of expo-
surebetweenneighborhoodsandindividuals,consequentlyresultinginmodelsthat
do not disentangle the differences of exposure between neighborhoods versus
individuals. Second, past studies have not assessed whether neighborhood differ-
ences in levels of exposure are due to individual characteristics of the child and/
or characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they reside. Perhaps children and
families residing in particular neighborhoods have similar characteristics to one
another when compared to their counterparts living in other neighborhoods, thus,
making it difficult to understand if characteristics of the neighborhoods or the
children and their families put them more at risk. Other studies have collected
data on national samples and consequently cannot reliably estimate contextual
effects. Finally, past studies often have not included independent and reliable
measures of neighborhood structural and social processes that may serve as
mechanisms for increased/decreased exposure to secondary violence.
The current study investigates questions regarding secondary exposure to
violence that we don't know the answers to yet. That is, (1) does secondary

exposure to violence for children and adolescents vary by neighborhood context
and (2) if so, what neighborhood characteristics matter, net of important family
and child characteristics or do individual characteristics explain contextual
differences?
Methods
Sample
The PHDCN is an interdisciplinary study aimed at advancing scientific knowledge
on the contextual determinates of children's psychological, social, and behavioral
development. A multistage sampling strategy was required so that neighborhoods,
families, and children could be studied simultaneously. Data from the PHDCN are
particularly well suited to assess the influence of neighborhood variables on expo-
sure to violence because of (1) the exhaustiveness of contextual measures created
from these data and validated over time (Sampson et al., 1997), and (2) data have
been collected on several cohorts of children at different stages of development.
There are two components to the sampling design: selection of neighborhood
clusters and dwellings for the longitudinal cohort study. First, 847 census tracts
were combined to create 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs). A stratification
procedure generated a representative sample of the racial, ethnic, and socio-
economic diversity of Chicago neighborhoods and produced a balanced sampling
design. Data on NCs were obtained from several sources including the 1990 US
Census used to measure neighborhood structural characteristics, a separate
community survey measuring neighborhood social processes, and crime data
from incident based records of the Chicago Police Department. From the 343
NCs, a stratified probability sample of 80 was selected for the longitudinal
cohort study, resulting in a set of racially/ethnically diverse NCs that spanned a
range of socioeconomic stratum.
Second, block groups were randomly selected from each of the 80 NCs.
Within each sampled block group a list of dwellings was compiled and household
members were enumerated, resulting in over 35,000 dwellings screened.
Infants, children, and adolescents (including 18 year olds) were recruited to
participate. Subjects were recruited if they were within six months of the
following age categories: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 years. This resulted in seven
cohorts that span major developmental milestones. Primary caregivers of
respondents were also recruited to participate. Respondents and caregivers
were interviewed up to three times between 1995 and 2002 in intervals of
2.5 years. We studied the 1,543 respondents from the 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old
cohorts who completed wave one and two interviews.3
3. Response rates for wave one ranged from 71.6 percent to 75.9 percent for the screened eligible
of the three cohorts, resulting in 2,344 subjects. At wave 2, response rates were 85.6 percent, 86.2
percent, and 82.7 percent for the 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old cohorts, respectively.
SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE DURING CHILDHOOD 41
Measures
Secondary exposure to violence
Our secondary exposure to violence measure is a 9-item index of various violent
events that subjects self-reported witnessing or hearing in the past 12 months
prior to the wave two interviews. Since we are concerned with witnessing and
hearing violence in neighborhood contexts, our measure is limited to neighbor-
hood-specific exposures that include: (1) saw someone hit, slapped, punched or
kicked, (2) saw someone attacked with a weapon, (3) saw someone get shot, (4)
saw someone get shot at, (5) heard gunfire, (6) saw accident where someone
was hurt, (7) saw someone killed, (8) saw someone threaten to seriously hurt
another person, and (9) saw someone get chased. Each question was coded 1 =
yes or 0 = no. Responses to each question were summed to create a scale ranging
from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating more secondary exposures to violence
within their neighborhoods. Our measure has a Kuder­Richardson reliability esti-
mate of .72.
Structural neighborhood characteristics
Three neighborhood structural variables were considered in our analyses (for
scale items and descriptive statistics see Appendix A and Table 1, respec-
tively). First, we include a measure of concentrated disadvantage, which
generally reflects the extent of poverty and segregation of a neighborhood.
Concentrated disadvantage was measured using six items including percent-
age neighborhood residents below the poverty line, percentage on public
assistance, percentage of female-headed families, percentage unemployed,
density of children by percentage younger than 18, and percentage Black.
This measure has been validated and used in previous studies with the PHDCN
(see Sampson et al., 1997). It was standardized with increasingly positive
scores reflecting more concentrated disadvantage. Second, immigrant concen-
tration was measured by the percent foreign born and the percent Latino
residents indicating the concentration of immigrants within neighborhoods.
Scores were standardized with more increasingly positive scores indicating
more immigrant concentration. Third, residential stability is a two-item
measure reflecting home ownership and length of residency in neighborhoods.
More positive scores on this measure represent more neighborhood residential
stability (for factor loadings of items in each measure see Sampson et al.,
1997).
Additionally, a standardized measure of neighborhood violent crime was
taken from incident based records of the Chicago Police Department in 1993.
It consists of murders, robberies, rapes, and aggravated assaults. Higher
scores indicate more violent crime, whereas lower scores indicate less violent
crime.
42 GIBSON ET AL.
Child-based collective efficacy
Several social organizational variables are included that can be considered protec-
tive factors for children and adolescents from experiencing secondary violence
exposure. Specifically, these characteristics include intergenerational closure,
reciprocal exchange, and child-centered social-control (see Sampson et al., 1999
for a more thorough discussion of these measures and their construct validity).
Each measure was derived from the independent, PHDCN community survey by
aggregating individual scores within each NC to achieve an average for each NC.
Intergenerational closure is a five-item scale and assesses the closeness of
parents and children within a community which provides social support for
children, information to parents, and helps in facilitating control. For example,
items include whether: "there are adults in this neighborhood that children can
look up to," " Parents in this neighborhood know their children's friends, " and
"You can count on adults in this neighborhood to watch out that children are safe
and don't get into trouble." Items were coded on a likert-type, 5-point scale rang-
ing from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Higher scores on this measure indicate

more intergenerational closure in a neighborhood. Reciprocal exchange is a five-
item scale which assesses the interaction of families with respect to childrearing
(bothparentandchildren),andsuchexchangescanrangefromgivingadvice,mate-
rial goods, and information about childrearing. For example, items ask: About how
often do you and people in your neighborhood do favors for each other?" and "How
often do you and other people in this neighborhood visit in each other's homes
or on the street?" Items were coded on a 4-point scale and responses ranged from
never, rarely, sometimes, or often. NCs with higher scores on this measure reflect
more reciprocal exchange within a neighborhood. Child-centered social control
is a three-item scale which reflects the collective willingness of residents to inter-
vene on behalf of children in the neighborhood beyond intervention by a child's
parents. Residents were asked, on a 5-point scale how likely (very unlikely to very
likely) that their neighbors would do something if skipping school and hanging out,
spray painting graffiti, and showing disrespect to an adult. Likewise, NCs with
higher scores indicate that they have more child-centered social control.
Finally, although not a child-based collective efficacy measure, a measure of
youth services is included as a neighborhood variable given that researchers recog-
nize that communities may want to provide after school programs for children and
adolescences to help reduce exposure (Luther & Goldstein, 2004). This measure
is an inventory of youth services within neighborhoods that include youth centers,
recreational programs, afterschool programs, mentoring and counseling services,
and crisis intervention. This measure was standardized to reflect the amount of
youth services in each NC, with more positive scores indicating more youth services
and less positive (or increasingly negative scores) indicating less youth services.
Demographics
Influenced by previous research, we chose to include gender, age, race/ethnic-
ity, and socioeconomic status as our individual, demographic characteristics.
Gender was coded as 0 = female or 1 = male. Age was measured continuously with
a mean of 12.07 and ranges from 7.8 to 16.4. Race/ethnicity was measured using
a set of dichotomous variables where 1 = Black, 1 = Hispanic, and 1 = Other
(White is the reference group for each category). Socioeconomic status was
measured using the principal component of three variables including household
income, maximum education level of primary caregiver and partner, and the
socioeconomic index (SEI) for primary caregiver's and partner's jobs. Socioeco-
nomic status is treated as a continuous variable with higher scores representing
higher family socioeconomic status.
Parenting characteristics
Items from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME)
Inventory were used to measure parenting characteristics. This inventory was
44 GIBSON ET AL.
generally designed to capture the quantity and quality of stimulation in a child's
home environment from primary caregivers (Caldwell & Bradley, 1984; Leventhal,
Selner-O'Hagan, Brooks-Gunn, Bingenheimer, & Earls, 2004). We included three
parenting variables measured during the wave one in-home interviews that
include: parental warmth, parental supervision/monitoring, and parental lack of
hostility. Parental warmth is measured using 9-item index derived from inter-
viewer's observations of parents during the in-home interview, including obser-
vations such as "parent voices positive feelings to child," "parent caresses, kisses,
or hugs child," and "parent responds positively to praise of child." Similarly,
parental lack of hostility consists of an index of four observational items, including
observations such as, "parent does not shout at child during visit" and "parent
does not slap or spank child." All items, for both measures, were coded 0 = no or
1 = yes. Responses were summed to create overall scale scores for the parental
warmth and lack of hostility measures, with higher scores indicating more
parental warmth and less hostility. Further, these measures exhibit acceptable
Kuder-Richardson reliabilities of .71. and .70, respectively (see also Leventhal
et al., 2004). Parental supervision is a scale of 13 items where primary caregivers
self-reported on how they directly and indirectly monitor their children. Specif-
ically, this measure reflects primary caregiver's knowledge of their child's where-
abouts, familiarity with child's friends, and rules surrounding curfews and
activities with friends. Higher scores on this scale indicate more parental super-
vision. The parental supervision scale exhibits a Cronbach alpha of .50.
Offending and antisocial propensity
Measures of prior offending/delinquency and propensity to engage in antisocial
behaviors, i.e., self-control, were administered during the wave one interviews.
A 19-item variety index of "yes" or "no" self-reported property and violent
offending questions are used to measure involvement in crime. Specifically, ques-
tions asked respondents if they have ever engaged in any of the delinquent and
offending behaviors. For instance, property offending includes items such as ever
broken into a building, stolen from a store, damaged property, and stolen from
a household member. Violent offending includes items such as ever attacked
someone with a weapon, robbed someone, been in a gang fight, thrown objects
at people, forced sex, and carried a weapon. Past research has shown that delin-
quent involvement increases the likelihood of secondary exposure to violence
(Selner-O'Hagan et al., 1998) and also indicates that delinquency, especially
violent delinquency, is perhaps an outcome of exposure. Using this measure from
wave 1 data collection as a predictor of levels of secondary violence, we establish
temporal ordering. Youth who are at an increased risk for violent victimization
will often live a lifestyle that encompasses criminal and antisocial behaviors.
Antisocial propensity is measured using a 17-item scale that primary caregivers
report on their children's level of self-control during wave 1 interviews.
Self-control has been measured in past studies using a variety of attitudinal and
SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE DURING CHILDHOOD 45
behavioral items, but some of the most widely used measures have been attitudinal
based (Pratt & Cullen, 2000). Researchers have found that behavioral and attitu-
dinal measures of self-control perform similarly and that there is little evidence
that behavioral measures should be more highly valued (Tittle, Ward, & Grasmick,
2003). Furthermore, Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) argue that the validity of self-
report, attitudinal questions can be jeopardized because level of self-control can
impact how individuals respond; therefore, we feel that a measure taken from
primary caregiver reports will not be affected by this potential concern.
Specifically, items from the EASI-temperament instrument are used including
the following subcomponents: inhibitory control, decision time, sensation seek-
ing, and persistence (see Buss & Plomin, 1975; Gibson, Sullivan, Jones, & Piquero,
2007). These dimensions are consistent with Gottfredson and Hirschi's conceptu-
alization of self-control, as well as past self-control measures (see Grasmick,
Tittle, Bursik, & Arneklev, 1993).
Inhibitory control reflects the inability to delay gratification and control frus-
trations. Examples of items include: trouble controlling impulses, can't stand
waiting, and has trouble resisting temptations. Those who possess low self-control
have a difficult time controlling their anger and are also likely to live in the "here
and now" and do not think about balancing instant gratification with the potential
adverse outcomes it may lead to (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990). Decision time taps
into a child's (in) ability to delay decision-making until other alternatives can be
seriously considered. For example, such items include: I often say the first thing
that comes into my head, often have trouble making up my mind, often times act
on the spur of the moment, and like to make detailed plans before I do something.
Sensation seeking items reflect a preference for novel stimuli and responses and
the likelihood of acting on the spur of the moment and such items include: gener-
ally likes to seek new and exciting sensations and experiences, sometimes does
"crazy" things just to be different, and willingness to try anything once. Persis-
tence is the likelihood that a child will follow through or complete a task. Children
with low self-control often may be the first to initiate a task, but also the first
to abort the task because they find it dull and boring, especially when the task
is not associated with immediate gratification. Examples of these items include:
generally likes to see things through to the end (reverse coded), tends to give up
easily, and once started on something hates to stop.
All items were on a 4-point, likert-type scale. Responses to items were
summed and standardized, where more positive scores reflect lower self-control
and more negative scores reflect higher self-control. Our self-control scale has a
Cronbach's reliability coefficient of .71.
Analytic Procedure
A Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling (HGLM) strategy is used because
children living in one neighborhood are more similar to each other than to chil-
dren living in others. Nested data can result in correlated error terms which
46 GIBSON ET AL.
manifest in biased standard errors in traditional regression. While an HGLM
allows for correcting of standard errors due to nested observations, it also
allows estimation of effects for both neighborhood and individual-level variables
with minimal statistical bias. Furthermore, it allows estimation of the variance
in children's secondary exposure to violence between and within neighborhoods
(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).
Because our outcome variable has a distribution that is a count of secondary
violence exposures which is positively skewed and violates the normality
assumption of a linear model, it is appropriate to treat it as an event or count
variable. Thus, we fit a HGLM (poisson model with constant exposure) that uses
a log link function. We estimated a two-level model, with subjects (level 1)
nested within NCs (level 2). The expected number of exposures to violence in an
NC, Yij, for subject i in NC j is its event rate, ij, times its exposure, mij; and
where the variance equals the mean. The expected value of Yij can be described
as: E(Yij|ij) = mij
ij. First, we estimate an unconditional model to assess
whether statistically significant variance is present between neighborhoods for
children's exposure. Second, if so, we estimate a model with only individual
characteristics to assess if selection processes account for the significant vari-
ance between neighborhoods. Third, if significant variance between neighbor-
hoods remains, we include contextual variables, while simultaneously making
adjustment for individual-level variables to assess the unique contributions of
neighborhood level characteristics.
Results
A considerable number of children report experiencing secondary violence in
their neighborhoods during the year prior to their wave 2 assessments. For
instance, during the 12 month period, 351 (22.7 percent) saw someone hit, 158
(10.2 percent) saw someone being attacked, 79 (5.1 percent) saw someone shot,
122 (7.9 percent) saw someone being shot at, 585 (37.9 percent) heard gunfire,
153 (9.9 percent) saw an accident where someone was hurt, 42 (2.7 percent) saw
someone killed, 161 (10.4 percent) saw someone threatened to be hurt, and 311
(20.2 percent) saw someone chased.
As shown in Table 1, of the nine violent acts, the average number witnessed
is 1.27, with the largest being 9 and the smallest being 0. Regarding demograph-
ics, the average age is 12.07, with the youngest being approximately 8 and the
oldest being approximately 16 years of age. Our sample consisted of 50 percent
males and 50 percent females. In addition, 16 percent are White, 34 percent
Black, 47 percent Hispanic, and 3 percent are classified as "other."
Tables 2 and 3 present results from multilevel models predicting secondary
exposure to violence. Table 2 shows an unconditional model that reports the
variance across NCs absent of individual or contextual variables. As shown,
secondary exposure to violence significantly varies across neighborhoods (00 =
.175; 2 = 413.297; p = .000). Table 3 presents results from two models. Model 1
SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE DURING CHILDHOOD 47
shows the effects of individual-level variables only; whereas, model 2 includes
both individual and neighborhood variables. In model 1, several individual-level,
demographic variables were found to be significant predictors of secondary
violence. Consistent with past research, males were significantly more likely to
experience higher levels of secondary violence exposure than females. Older
children, compared to their younger counterparts, were significantly more
likely to experience higher levels of exposure. Relative to the reference group
(White), the likelihood of exposure was higher for Blacks, but not for Hispanics
or those in the other category. However, the risk of exposure was no more likely
among children and adolescents whose parents show a lack of warmth, more
hostility or less supervision and monitoring than those children whose parents
show more warmth, less hostility, or more supervision and monitoring. The role
of prior offending and delinquency in witnessing violence was highly significant,
where those reporting more delinquent acts at wave 1 were more likely to
report higher levels of exposure to secondary violence. Finally, children and
adolescents with less self-control (i.e., higher scores on the self-control scale)
were significantly more likely to experience more exposure to secondary
violence than those with more self-control. While our reported individual-level
effects are supportive of past research, they do not account for all of the vari-
ance in secondary violence shown in Table 2, suggesting that contextual-level
factors are possibly important. Specifically, secondary violence exposure still
significantly varies across neighborhoods (00 = .096; 2 = 275.260; p = .000),
but, nonetheless, the variance between neighborhoods is substantially reduced.
As shown in model 2 of Table 3, when neighborhood variables are added the
individual-level effects on exposure were maintained. However, none of the
child-based collective efficacy measures emerged as statistically significant
predictors and the violent crime measure was not a significant predictor either.
In contrast, both immigrant concentration and concentrated disadvantage were
positive and statistically significant predictors of exposure, indicating that
children and adolescents living in poorer, segregated neighborhoods and those
living in areas with higher concentrations of immigrants were more likely to
witness and hear violence, even after adjustments were made for individual-
level factors. Further, youth living in neighborhoods that have more youth
services were significantly less likely to be exposed to secondary violence than
their counterparts living in areas with fewer youth services available. Nonethe-
less, when neighborhood variables are added the variance between NCs

remained statistically significant, although it was reduced (00 = .061; 2 =

Discussion
Our study builds on previous research generally and with the PHDCN more
specifically, resulting in several new and important results that contribute to
the understanding of children and adolescents exposure to secondary violence
in their neighborhoods. First, our study has shown that children's exposure does

significantly vary across geographical areas of Chicago and that it cannot be
fully explained by individual-level risk factors. Second, we find that several
neighborhood variables have significant effects on exposure above and beyond
individual risk factors. Specifically, youth living in poverty stricken areas and
those living in areas with higher concentrations of Latino's and foreign born are
more likely to witness and hear violence in their neighborhoods. The immigrant
concentration effect is particularly interesting given that recent studies from
the PHDCN data show that living in an area with more immigrants is a protective
factor against children engaging in violence (Sampson et al., 2005).4 Further,
we found that youth services in neighborhoods can act as protective factors
against witnessing and hearing violence in that the more youth services in a
neighborhood the less children are exposed to secondary forms of violence.
However, we must be careful how this relationship is interpreted. Our data
cannot identify the mechanisms in which youth service facilities are working to
protect kids from being exposed. For instance, do such outlets keep youth off
the streets, therefore reducing time they have to be exposed to violence? Or,
are youth service facilities teaching children about the consequential impacts of
exposure to violence?
Finally, we found that neighborhood informal social controls and protections
for children did not reduce secondary violence exposure. That is, child-based
collective efficacy variables did not have statistically significant effects on
exposure. Children who live in neighborhoods where parents share information,
monitor children, etc. are no more likely than children living in dissimilar neigh-
borhoods to have higher rates of exposure to secondary violence. Although such
social processes within and between neighborhoods have been hypothesized to
be related to negative outcomes for children and adolescents, this finding is
perhaps not so surprising because collective efficacy measures targeting kids
could have a larger impact on primary exposure, i.e., personal violent victimiza-
tion, because such communities can help remove kids from dangerous situations.
But, some kids still live in dangerous neighborhoods where violence may not be
under control of community members or parents and therefore kids may certainly
still hear and witness violent acts. In Anderson's (1999) research on the "code of
the streets" he discusses how good families and kids, i.e., "decent families," live
in bad neighborhoods. While parents may have some influence over what their
children become involved in, they may not influence what they see or hear. In
sum, our findings on neighborhood predictors address several recent charges by
scholars to target communities in reducing violence exposure and its conse-
quences (Luther & Goldstein, 2004; Sullivan et al., 2004). Our findings are some-
what consistent with their suggestions in that context does matter, regardless of
4. Importantly, we should note that violence occurring in neighborhoods did not have a significant
impact on whether children were exposed to violence. We originally thought that perhaps this could
be due to multicollinearity with other contextual variables, but further diagnostic analyses, e.g.,
correlations and variance inflation factors, indicated that severe multicollinearity was not a
problem. All VIFs were below 4, and bivariate correlations were below .7.
50 GIBSON ET AL.
individual actions, personalities, and demographic characteristics of children and
adolescents.
We have also learned that neighborhood conditions are not the only piece of
the violence exposure puzzle and that careful attention should be paid to
demographic, behavioral, and personality characteristics of children that
increase exposure risk above and beyond neighborhood conditions. Among indi-
vidual-level risk factors, our analyses support past research that has found
Blacks, males, and older youth are at highest risk for exposure to secondary
violence. Further, our analyses support prior research that indicates those
involved in more offending and delinquent behaviors to be at a higher risk
(Selner-O'Hagan et al., 1998). Importantly, these effects remain even when
adjustments are made for the context in which these children and adolescents
live.
Finally, our study finds that a lack of self-control increases the risk of
witnessing and hearing violence. This effect is consistent with criminological
research which shows that youth with low self-control are more at risk for
engaging in delinquency, associating with other delinquent youth, being person-
ally victimized, and putting themselves in high risk situations that could amplify
the likelihood of being exposed (Pratt & Cullen, 2000; Schreck, 1999; Schreck
et al., 2006). This finding suggests that to limit exposure to secondary violence
and its consequences, intervention efforts should start early to target self-
control development, as Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) argue that the develop-
ment of self-control occurs by late childhood and then remains relatively stable
throughout the life-course.
We should note, too, that somewhat contrary to expectations, parental
warmth, parental supervision, and parental lack of hostility were not signifi-
cantly associated with secondary exposure to violence. This is somewhat
surprising given the long line of research indicating that parents have strong and
robust effects on their children's behavior. Perhaps exposure to violence is
largely outside the influence of parents, and may be more of a function of
individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics. The results of the hierarchi-
cal models definitely support this possibility, but more research is needed to
explicate more fully the relationship between exposure and parenting styles.
Analysis of the PHDCN data also revealed that a substantial number of
children witnessed and heard acts of serious physical violence. These findings
should not be casually glossed over. Exposure to violence has serious deleterious
consequences that are carried forward throughout the life course. Youth who
witness violence, for example, have higher rates of PTSD, depression, and
distress. Just as importantly, however, is that externalizing behaviors and
engaging in acts of aggression are more common among youths who are exposed
to violence (Buka et al., 2001).
The close nexus between exposure to violence and involvement in offend-
ing/antisocial behaviors is of particular importance to crime and delinquency
prevention efforts. Reducing offending behaviors of youth should lead to a
concomitant reduction in secondary violence exposure. In particular, low
SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE DURING CHILDHOOD 51
self-control and concentrated disadvantage--two potent risk factors to adoles-
cent delinquency--emerged as predictors of exposure. Although only specula-
tive, if these two risk factors could be attenuated, then we would perhaps
expect that crime and delinquent involvement should decrease, exposure to
secondary violence should decrease, and the emotional well-being of children
should increase. Of course the risk factors identified in our research represent
only a handful of variables that contribute to the understanding of violence
exposure. Future researchers needs to expand on our work and begin to map
out the ways in which other individual-, familial-, and neighborhood-level char-
acteristics work independently and synergistically to promote exposure to
secondary violence.
With these findings in mind, it is important to point out the main limitations
of our research. Perhaps most important is the need to reproduce our results in
cities other than Chicago to determine whether our findings are generalizable to
other geographical areas. This largely remains an open-empirical question that
needs to be addressed in future research. Even so, we should note that the
findings reported in respect to age, race, gender, and offending/delinquency
mirror those found in other studies (see Buka et al., 2001), indicating that our
findings are in alignment with data drawn from other regions.
Furthermore, our analyses are restricted to only assessing correlates of
secondary exposure to violence. Although many studies have identified the
negative consequences associated with exposure, limited work has been
conducted on how neighborhood conditions may moderate or interact with
these relationships to further exacerbate the negative impacts of exposures on
children. We view this as a ripe area for future research that has mostly been
neglected.
The mechanisms that can explain the direct relationships between neighbor-
hood conditions and exposure to violence need further exploration. For
instance, we found that concentrated disadvantage is a risk factor for exposure
and thought that perhaps the intervening mechanisms that could explain this
linkage would be child-based collective efficacy. This, however, was not the
case. A fruitful line for future research might be to focus on how structural
conditions of a neighborhood (e.g., level of concentrated disadvantage) may
structure behaviors of youth which in turn lead to higher levels of exposure. As
mentioned earlier, Anderson's (1999) "code of the streets" could be helpful in
understanding why children living in neighborhoods with high concentrations of
disadvantage are more susceptible to secondary violence exposure. Further-
more, research has shown that concentrated immigration has a beneficial effect
on adolescents' violent behavior (Sampson et al., 2005), however, we show the
opposite for exposure to secondary violence. Therefore, it is important to
continue exploring the mechanisms for why concentrated immigration increases
exposure for youth.
Neighborhood specific exposures to secondary violence were under investiga-
tion herein. Of course exposure can occur in various contexts including, but not
limited to, schools. Future investigations should assess multiple contexts and
52 GIBSON ET AL.
determine whether (1) children exposed to more secondary violence in their
neighborhood are also more likely to be exposed at high levels in other contexts
and (2) if such a correlation exists, whether individual propensities (e.g., low
self-control) can help explain this relationship. Perhaps youth with extremely
low self-control put themselves in high risk environments that increase their
exposure across all types of contexts, regardless of the conditions of the neigh-
borhoods in which they live. It seems intuitive to extend our results by pursuing
a more profound assessment of when neighborhoods matter more and when
they matter less. This could perhaps be conditioned by individual behaviors and
propensities.
We close by noting that exposure to secondary violence is due to a multifac-
torial arrangement of individual attributes and neighborhood characteristics.
Most of the secondary exposure to violence literature, however, has focused on
delineating the individual-level risk factors, leaving neighborhood determinates
less understood. But as our research indicates, context is important and should
be addressed more fully by future researchers. Only by examining the close
interconnections between individuals within contexts will we be able to better
explain, predict, and ultimately reduce exposure to and minimize the conse-
