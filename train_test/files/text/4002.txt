Introduction
In community development, the approach generally focuses
on leveraging the community resources as a basis to develop
the community. This follows the bottom-up principle and is
consistent with the objectives of community development.
According to Diacon and Guimarães (2003), the aim of com-
munity development is to empower marginalized communi-
ties. This involves building confidence, building the capacity
and sustainability of networks available in the community,
and restoring its physical, economic, and social structures.
According to Brennan and Barnett (2009), community devel-
opment is a reflection of the local population's ability to
mobilize and manage the resources available to meet the
needs of local communities. Both definitions refer to com-
munity resources and their importance to community
development.
However, this does not mean that it is necessary to set
aside elements that pose a threat to community development.
For example, Payne (2006) observed that if less cohesive-
ness is present, communities can become paralyzed.
Meanwhile, Pyles and Harding (2012) discovered that an
activity that displays the intimate relationships among com-
munity members is an element that aids in the success of
community development. On the other hand, if community
cohesion decreases, anomie symptoms will be evoked in the
community, from which loneliness can result in suicides.
Amir Zal, Samah, and Redzuan (2012) consider the threat
of community development from a different angle; that the
problem cannot be involved in the community, which leaves
the side effects to the youth and known victims of disempow-
erment. Disempowerment is a condition that is contrary to
empowerment. As a result of disempowerment, the commu-
nity cannot develop because community resources in the
form of human capital cannot be utilized by the youth.

The Vulnerability of Community Capitals
as a Threat to Orang Kuala Community
Development in Malaysia
W. A. Amir Zal1, Mustaffa Omar2, Hood Salleh2, and
Sharina Ab. Halim2
Abstract
Community development emphasizes the utilization of community resources, also known as community capitals. However,
it is often difficult for the community to access these resources; this difficulty retards development. Such is the predicament
faced by the Orang Kuala, for whom coastal changes have resulted in greater difficulty in accessing their community resources.
Nor is that the only threat that they face. For affirmation of these threats, this article lists two objectives, that is, to
identify the accessibility of marine resources and to explain the types of threats faced by the Orang Kuala. To achieve these
objectives, a study was conducted involving 51 household heads and 5 Orang Kuala informants, all of whom are residents
of Sungai Layau village in Johor, Malaysia. This study uses a mixed-method approach, the concurrent embedded design, and
also interview-based questionnaires and in-depth interviews simultaneously. For the first objective, the results show that the
Orang Kuala can still attain community resources in the form of marine products. However, the Orang Kuala faced three
types of threats: trends, shocks, and seasonal changes. The most significant threat to the Orang Kuala is the trend, that
is, cost of living and social problems. These threats can reduce their chances of acquiring benefits from these community
resources. This condition is called "vulnerability of community capitals." The objective of this article is to put forth proposals
on how to increase the capacity of community resources for the Orang Kuala so that their community can attain sustainable
development. This proposal is based on the reality that the threats facing the Orang Kuala are at a critical level and that they
are ready to accept changes.

development can be explained through the Asset-Based
Community Development (ABCD) approach. ABCD is an
alternative approach to replace the needs-based approach
(Boyd, Hayes, Wilson, & Bearsley-Smith, 2008). It includes
strategies to identify and mobilize community "assets" for a
change (Boyd et al., 2008). The assets in the context of the
ABCD do not refer to purely economic factors but include
the capacities of the community (Kretzmann & McKnight,
2005), such as natural, human, social, cultural, political, and
financial assets (Callaghan & Colton, 2008; Fey, Bregendahl,
& Flora, 2006). Through those assets, communities no lon-
ger rely on foreign societies to solve their problems, using
instead the maximal resources in their communities
(Kretzmann & McKnight, 2005).
This approach, however, is not always right for all situa-
tions. A study by Mulligan and Nadarajah (2012) reviewed
the lessons to be derived from community rebuilding in the
wake of the 2004 tsunami that struck India and Sri Lanka.
Those scholars found that the participation of community
members in the beginning is not ideal, but remedial assis-
tance from outside parties is necessary in the beginning. This
assistance is not easy to implement. According to Islam and
Morgan (2012), external organizations, particularly non-
governmental Organizations (NGOs), need social capital to
achieve community empowerment. The forms of such
empowerment are collective action, social trust, coordination
and cooperation of mutual benefits, and sharing norms and
values.
These resources are of great importance as a catalyst for
community development. Threats to a community can be
seen in terms of accessibility to community resources and
occur when community resources that should be used for the
purpose of incentivizing the community to achieve a better
life, whether economic, social, or administrative, cannot be
fully utilized. The situation becomes more serious when
resource accessibility becomes difficult to achieve and com-
munities are no longer free to use the resources. The failure
to take advantage of community resources for community
development is a big setback for any community. This situa-
tion puts the community in a vulnerable state and subtracts
from its development.
The Orang Kuala is an indigenous Proto-Malay tribe, and
they are noticed to be undergoing changes. They are dis-
tinctly different from the Orang Asli Darat, which depends
on the forests. In contrast, the Orang Kuala tribe is known as
Orang Asli Laut due to their total dependence on a marine
environment (Amir Zal, Redzuan, Samah, & Hamsan, 2012).
They catch fish in the watersheds by boat and lead a nomadic
life (Yuszaidy Mohd Yusoff, Mohamad Nazri Ahmad, &
Mohamed Anwar Omar Din, 2009). History indicates that
the Orang Kuala play a significant role as pirates, robbing
certain groups as a strategy to protect the interests of the
Malay Sultanate.
According to Andaya (2008), Orang Kuala individuals
were warriors and ship captains during the days of the Malay
Sultanate. Their knowledge of the sea made them invaluable
in these roles. However, after the fall of the Malay Sultanate,
the Orang Kuala went back to living as fishermen, becoming
completely dependent on the sea, where they could find and
exploit marine resources for their survival.
A study conducted by Yuszaidy Mohd Yusoff et al. (2009)
found that Orang Kuala have greatly changed but have
neglected their identity as the Sea Peoples. Similarly, a study
conducted by Amir Zal, Redzuan, Samah, and Hamsan
(2013) also found that the Orang Kuala are forgetting their
identity with some of them assuming that they are the
Malays. The denial of the original identity affects their com-
munity capitals as it induces less access to their community
capitals. Consequently, this scenario is significant to the
study because it can be a determining factor to the survival of
the community.
The Orang Kuala Rhetoric of Threats
A study by Amir Zal, Redzuan, et al. (2012) shows changes
in the Orang Kuala's way of life. Current investigations show
that they have become actively involved in business activi-
ties in which they have shown some measure of success. The
history of Orang Kuala stated that their economic activity is
based on the sea (Andaya, 2008; Carey, 1976), and the
involvement dates back to the 15th century (Harper, 1997).
Their participation in economic activities is not as minor
characters but as a supplier of marine products to the Chinese
market (Carey, 1976). However, in the 18th century, their
economic activity was threatened due to the engagement of
the Bugis Sulawesi community in the same economic activ-
ity (Harper, 1997). The vulnerability became more critical
when the Malays from Indonesia in the mid-19th century
migrated massively to the Orang Kuala economic activities
and grabbed the same resources (Harper, 1997). The situa-
tion is deepened and further weakens the Orang Kuala
through a political problem that marginalizes the role of
Orang Kuala in the economy. Thus, the Orang Kuala eco-
nomic activity is no longer a significant contributor to the
whole of society.
However, in the 20th century, they reengage in the activi-
ties of the current economy. They are still focusing on the
traditional economic activities as fishermen, but at the same
time, they worked as traders, importers, and middlemen sell-
ing second-hand goods such as clothes from Singapore and
exporting vegetables. Their participation in economic activi-
ties is not recorded properly, so it is difficult to obtain accu-
rate data on the number of people who were involved in a
new economic activity. Even so, they have not completely
left their old ways behind. For the tribe, the sea still forms the
core of their identity. They still remain close to the sea, even
if only as a pastime or a hobby (Amir Zal, Redzuan, et al.,
2012).
A variety of development activities have been imple-
mented on the coast. Coastal developments are beneficial but
Amir Zal et al. 3
also pose a threat to the community. For example, surveys
conducted by Stead (2005) and Er, Selvadurai, Ardieansyah,
and Jusoh (2011) show that development in coastal commu-
nities has resulted in the destruction and loss of coastal
marine resources and caused changes in marine ecology.
This situation also affects the Orang Kuala, as their environ-
ment has also been exposed to development, and it raises
questions about the accessibility of their marine resources.
So far, only developments on the coast have been associ-
ated with threats to coastal communities. However, there are
other forms that can also pose a threat, such as natural disas-
ters, shocks, and trends. Natural disasters refer to threats that
cannot be controlled and therefore are not a conscious option
chosen by the coastal community, such as seasonal changes
with regard to monsoon circulations. Trend threats refer to
changes in the economy, social situations, and leadership.
Shocks are a form of threat that cannot be detected at an early
stage and can occur suddenly. Not only is the irrelevant
development to be associated with the threat to coastal com-
munities, but there is a threat in other forms as well. These
are the issues that have determined the objectives of this
study, which are to identify the accessibility of marine
resources and to explain the types of threats faced by the
Orang Kuala.
Coastal Communities and Strength of Marine
Resources
The survival of fishermen depends entirely on marine
resources. However, it is not only fishermen who depend on
these resources, for the general public is also dependent on
the produce supplied by the fishermen. Therefore, the fisher-
man is a significant moderator of the access of marine
resources and their distribution to the public. However, their
role is often underestimated and viewed as second-class,
despite the fact that the fisherman is able to generate a good
income (Hassan, Shaffril, D'Silva, Omar, & Bolong, 2011).
The generation of a substantial income shows that marine
resources can propel economic growth. Fishermen play a
crucial role in the economic development of the country (Siti
Zobidah & Chhachhar, 2012). Thus, marine resources are
important resources in the coastal community and to the gen-
eral public.
Coastal communities are often faced with difficulty in
accessing marine resources. According to Svensson,
Rodwell, and Attrill (2010), reductions in the number of fish
caught throughout the past decade is a problem that has been
faced by all communities. According to Clay and Olson
(2008), some fishing communities are threatened because
they are directly affected by the shortage of marine resources.
This reality is similar to that found in the study conducted by
Pakpahan, Lumintang, and Susanto (2006) in North Jakarta.
The study found that coastal communities face difficulties in
increasing income, especially during certain seasons, which
will determine whether the crop that they harvest is a bumper
one or a dud. This puts them in a vulnerable situation and
may even invite other problems, including political, social,
and economic problems (Clay & Olson, 2008). These prob-
lems can result in poverty for the fishermen (Tzanatosa et al.,
2006). Unfortunately, these particular problems are beyond
the control of anyone in the coastal communities.
Vast coastlines have opened many opportunities for the
development of economic-oriented profit. These include
tourism, agriculture, aquaculture, housing, industry, ports,
land reclamation, and other beach activities, as implemented
in the Iskandar Malaysia development project at Danga Bay
Waterfront (Rosniza Aznie, Abdul Rahim, Ahmad, Buang, &
Zainol, 2011). Although this gives a good impression in
terms of economic growth, the drastic changes brought on by
rapid development can often result in an opposite effect. For
example, impacts on coastal communities and their cultures
can destroy whole livelihoods. These resources are so crucial
to developmental activities that the communities would not
survive if the resources were to be destroyed (Dahalan et al.,
2012).
Coastal communities are deeply concerned with the
advent of development that has forced them to change and
adapt within a short time. The effects of development include
depopulation and sociodemographic, physical, socioeco-
nomic, and security threats (Omar et al., 2011). The negative
effects of coastal development were further confirmed
through findings by Er et al. (2011) in a study made on the
coast of Dumai Jakarta, Indonesia. This study shows the
increase of adverse impacts on the local community as a
result of rapid economic development, which include marine
pollution, deterioration of the livelihoods of fishermen, tour-
ism, and coastal ecology.
A similar finding was made by Jamaluddin Jahi (2009), in
which he reported loss of habitat, erosion, sedimentation,
and extinction of natural habitats. These problems destroy
and affect activities necessary to the daily lives of coastal
communities (Marschiavelli & Niendyawati, 2007; Nur
Hafizah & Aziz, 2010). Community-based experience and
confirmation by scientific studies clearly demonstrate that
the implementation of coastal development has a great
impact on humans due to the fact that oceanic and coastal
changes pose more complex problems than many may real-
ize, and can cause a lasting impact on coastal communities.
Countless problems faced by coastal communities can be
observed based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework
(SLA), which was introduced by the U.K. Government's
Department for International Development (DFID). SLA
suggests vulnerability observed on three forms, namely,
shock, seasonality, and trend. The shock is in the form of
threats that occur suddenly, and the seasonality is a threat
that occurs at certain seasons. Meanwhile the trend is phe-
nomenon-based, it is not expected to be prolonged. However,
the model was modified slightly to suit the concerns of this
4 SAGE Open
study, which relate to the accessibility of community capital
related to natural capital of Orang Kuala.
Research Method
The study was conducted by using a mixed-method, which is
a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches.
The purpose of using this approach was that researchers
could obtain as much data as possible. The data obtained not
only have high reliability but also are persuasive in showing
that the data collected truly reflect the reality of the subjects.
This study uses concurrent embedded design. This study
design allows researchers to gather qualitative and quantita-
tive data in a balanced and simultaneous manner, as gather-
ing all types of data is important (Andrew & Halcomb,
2009).
Quantitative data were collected from 51 household heads
that live in Sungai Layau village, Johor. In addition, five
informants were chosen for the qualitative approach. The
selection of 51 household heads as the sample size is based
on the census and not based on the sampling principle. Fifty-
one is the total number of household heads who lived at the
Sungai Layau village. In particular, they are composed of
49% male and 51% female. A total of 37.3% of them were
aged between 41 and 56 years, followed by individuals aged
57 years and above, which were 33.3%, and 29.4% aged 26
to 40 years.
The five informants for the qualitative data collection are
determined based on the principles of data saturation.
Researchers stopped interviewing the fifth informant as he
gave sufficient information to achieve the objectives of this
study and the answer is very similar to other informants. The
selection of the five informants is based on the maximum
variation principle that assumed each informant selected has
a different value from the other.
Researchers used two methods simultaneously, the inter-
view-based questionnaires and in-depth interviews, based on
semi-structured interview protocol. Data collection tech-
niques applied by the researchers were conducted as follows.
Researchers asked quantitative questions first, and each item
in the interview was then interspersed with qualitative ques-
tions. The disadvantage of this technique is that it takes a
long time, at an average of 2 hr for one-on-one respondents
of the study.
Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS software,
using descriptive statistics only. Data were displayed as a
percentage of each item in the questionnaire. The qualitative
data were coordinated and analyzed using QSR NVivo soft-
ware. Data were analyzed using basic qualitative data analy-
sis techniques, namely, open coding, clustering, categorizing,
and thematic method. The presentation of the results alter-
nates between quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative
data are presented first, followed by qualitative data, which
are presented based on descriptive techniques.
Findings and Discussion
Accessibility of Resources From the Sea
Table 1 presents data on the accessibility of marine resources.
With respect to the accessibility of food resources from the
sea, most of the respondents (80.4%) stated that there are still
a lot of state resources and as much as 84.3% stated that these
resources are easily accessible. This point is illustrated by the
informants who stated that food sources in the form of fish,
crabs, and other foods are still plentiful. Although they
acknowledge that the sea is no longer as abundant as before,
the quantity obtained is sufficient to sustain daily life. In fact,
the excess still allows them to use it for their businesses.
Similarly, for the question of accessibility of relevant sources,
informants said that they are still readily available. This fact
is manifested in the statement of Informant C: "There is a
normal range. Em, but if you want to appeal once, not multi-
ply. But enough to sell shall be."
With respect to medical resources from the sea, only
19.6% of the respondents expressed that they are at a high
quantity and easily available. With apprehension to this mat-
ter, informants expressed some confusion concerning the
medical resources. According to the informants, not many
marine resources can be a source of medicine. This is because
medicinal use of marine resources is not something that has
been practiced by the Orang Kuala. Moreover, their lives
now have changed and they have started to leave the tradi-
tional life and follow a modern lifestyle. This includes the
use of modern medical practices:

Amir Zal et al. 5
I ever hear the sea cucumber. But I did not know much Orang
Kuala here know how to use it. But Orang Kuala there used to
know. Orang Kuala now would no longer know. If you ask other
boys they would not know. (Informant D)
Respondents were also asked about the use of marine
resources for commercialization or for economic activities.
Most respondents (96.1%) stated that marine resources for
economic activities are still plenty. Even as much as 94.1%
of the respondents stated that these resources are easily avail-
able. Although not all respondents use fishing activities as
their primary source of income, they stated that the use of
marine resources for commercial purposes is still able to pro-
vide income to them. They get high demand for sea products
in foreign markets. This situation also puts informants in a
better position because resources are easy to find. They set-
tled near the sea, and that enabled them to access marine
resources at any time. "That's easy, near the sea. Chinese and
Malay were waiting for fish. Just open our eyes, already saw
the fish. Hahaha" (Informant A).
In addition, the question of the use of marine resources for
commercial and recreational purposes also indicates that
they are still plenty, with 96.1% of the respondents indicating
that the resources are abundantly and readily available. For
the informants, every sea or beach environment can be har-
nessed for recreational activities such as swimming, picnick-
ing, and boat racing. Informants believe that the marine
resources in the form of sandy beaches and calm seas can not
only serve as a resource for recreation but can also boost the
local economic activity. However, the informants and villag-
ers have not commenced such activities seriously. The reality
is shared by Informant B:
I (see) a chance. Look, beautiful place. It is Orang Kuala like to
come. But this has not landed all of us, so who wants to go can
go. The son can swim, boat was going ok. You can come to the
sea with your family. But we do not know how to focus on
tourism activities.
On the other hand, the non-marine sources are few and
hard to come by. This is due to the fact that Orang Kuala are
the Sea Orang Kuala and they are not skilled enough to
explore the opportunities of non-sea-based resources.
Instead, they focus on marine resources only. Although the
Orang Kuala increasingly leave traditional activities such as
fishing, they are less able to exploit other natural resources,
particularly forest or land resources. These limitations give
them the inability to make full use of parts of their environ-
ment that have nothing to do with the sea. Reality shows that
the respondent had difficulty adapting to non-sea environ-
ments. See the statement represented by Informant D:
Normally, all changed. We also want to change, but it takes time.
Before, everything we did in a boat . . . Eating, sleeping,
marriage on a boat. The sea is very important to us. But when
(locate in) land, gotta live by the sea too. Changing other work
there, but have to working with other Orang Kuala.
In conclusion, the Orang Kuala's marine resources are
still plentiful and easy to obtain. This situation can be an
opportunity for local communities to utilize marine
resources for community development activities. In addi-
tion, the availability of resources to the community bestows
on them the strength to make changes as suggested by Boyd
et al. (2008). The studies from Amir Zal, Redzuan, et al.
(2012) show that the ownership of community capitals
enables economic empowerment. Community development
could occur because local communities find it easier to take
advantage of community resources that they have been
familiar with for a long time. However, community devel-
opment will be hindered if the community is satisfied with
its current level of community resources without consider-
ing the potential for increased capacity of the resource. This
point of view aligns with Brennan and Barnett's (2009)
suggestion that community development occurs when com-
munity members build a community capacity for existing
resources.
The Threats to the Orang Kuala
Referring to Table 2, this study shows that there are three
types of threats faced by the respondents: trends, shocks, and
seasonal changes. The trends refer to changes that are
assumed to occur in accordance with the progress of society
and modernization. In the context of this study, the trends
observed seemed to negatively affect the lives of the Orang
Kuala. A shock refers to a sudden change in contrast to com-
mon expectations and is not expected to occur in the com-
munity. The seasonal changes were defined as the events that
cannot be controlled, such as temperature, monsoon circula-
tion, and so on.
The trends. The greatest threats faced by the respondents are
changes in the cost of living and social problems, respond
92.2% of the participants. These threats include inflation of
the prices of essential goods. The interviews with infor-
mants reveal similar and consistent responses, for example,
the following statement by Informant E: "Hard, very hard . .
. We don't have much money. But, goods price go up as
well. More expensive. The day before are not like this, for
fifty dollars a lot of goods can buy. Now can be gone an
hour."
The same is stated by Informant A on the trends in social
problems, such as substance abuse and addictions to alcohol,
drugs, gambling, and prostitution. These social problems dis-
turb informants, despite the lack of their serious prevalence
in Orang Kuala communities. The informant displays con-
cern that a social problem has emerged in Orang Kuala com-
munities although it is still manageable:
I do not want to accuse anyone, but this thing happened. Shame
also wants to tell Mr. This is cause by the Orang Kuala from
outside. Make friends with them, we get their disease. We worry
about our children, but older Orang Kuala there too. Hehehe.
6 SAGE Open
The other major threat is climate change, which 74.5% of
the respondents had faced. This trend relating to climate
change had been affecting fishing activities. This is not an
obvious trend, but the change has been noticed by the Orang
Kuala. This is explained by informant C: "Yes, there is. But
not changed much . . . Yes, I noticed. How did . . . come
increasingly strong wind, storm, big waves can suddenly
come. But not tsunami. Hahaha."
However, the informant could not say precisely whether
changes that can be attributed to climate change have often
been discussed in mainstream society or not. Nevertheless,
they realize that climate change has occurred by comparing
present sea conditions with previous sea conditions.
With respect to a change in the form of governance, only
56.9% of the respondents said that such an event occurred.
The informants who stated that the event occurred detailed a
description as follows:
To say it changed? The usual console . . . every leader sees other
things. Here also same. But (change) has he brought, must we
not feel comfortable. We support good, if not we will be angry.
There is little bad, but our Orang Kuala must be angry, he scared
too. (Informant D)
The statements from Informant D shows that any leader-
ship conflict in their community is under control and can be
tempered with a communal spirit. Although they realize that
there is a conflict due to changes in governance or leadership
in the community, they still feel a sense of belonging as the
Orang Kuala prioritize community in such circumstances.
Therefore, they do not consider a change in leadership threat-
ening to their communities.
In addition, only 49% of the respondents said that the
development of technological change threatens their lives.
The informants stated that the development of technology is
not something that threatens their lives but a phenomenon
that can inspire them to live a better and more equal life up to
mainstream society's standards. In fact, they look to the
development of technology to help them get out of a range of
problems, such as the issue of poverty and the negative ste-
reotypes imposed by society onto them:
We are as Orang Asli . . . The outsiders thought we're backward,
wear loincloth. We never wear loincloth. Hehehe. If developed,
like some new tools, like going to the sea, with the boat engine,
make easy we to find the fish. Fast, no need to paddle . . . Our
lives so look like a plague, like the Malays too. So, be looking to
eat more. Can have a car, house can be good. So, the other Orang
Kuala are not saying us as Orang Asli anymore. (Informant E)
The tone of the informant's statement reflects his valua-
tion of development. The informants do not see technologi-
cal development as a threat but as something that can
motivate them to keep pace with development. As for the use
of technology, it is not alienating to the Orang Kuala, who
welcome it because it helps them to change and facilitate
their lives.
In conclusion, there were three major trends threatening
the Orang Kuala, that is, the rising cost of living, social
issues, and climate change. Of the three trends, only social
problems can be controlled by the Orang Kuala. The two
other threats, which are the increasing cost of living and cli-
mate change, cannot be controlled by the Orang Kuala. A
threat that cannot be controlled by humans has

been discussed by Pakpahan et al. (2006), that is, the threat
of seasonal changes. This threat is a common threat faced by
coastal communities. Coastal communities insist on making
any changes that they need to prepare for climate change.
This has to do with the Orang Kuala's view on development.
They do not consider development and technological change
as threats but as aids to help them to join the mainstream
society's development. This is because the development on
the coast is having a positive impact on the community in
terms of promoting the growth of activity (Rosniza Aznie et
al., 2011).
The shocks.The shock faced by 51% of the respondents is
some form of epidemic disease. This percentage is not high
because very few cases of plague existed among the Orang
Kuala. This example is described by Informant B: "That's
disease is, like hives, stomach pain. Ha, abdominal pain first
is our Orang Kuala were upset stomach. I do not know to
what epidemic. But many are ill. But do not be cause for
death."
Only 35.3% of the respondents considered an economic
crisis that causes cessation of work as a different kind of
threat, and 13.7% of the respondents considered natural
disasters such as hurricanes a threat. If an economic crisis
happened, the Orang Kuala do not feel worried because they
have other sources of income, such as working as fishermen.
However, they still feel worried if the economic crisis affects
their ability to repay debts monthly: "Never be afraid because
of economic crisis, we can work the sea (fishing). Fish are
also a lot . . . but if thinking the car debt, makes head pain"
(Informant C).
With regard to the forms of the natural disaster shocks
such as hurricanes, informants did not express much con-
cern. This is because they are familiar with these natural
disasters and accept them as normative of life as the Sea
People. They also noted that natural disasters do not always
happen and do not interfere with the routine of their lives.
The following example is mentioned by Informant A:
Em, when it comes (the storm), that normal for strong wind.
Live by the sea, was normal. If feel fear is not the Sea Orang
Kualas. Shame. Hehehe. If come too (storm), we are not difficult
it is, just sometimes.
In conclusion, the shocks do not comprise a threat to the
Orang Kuala. This is because the form of the threats affect-
ing them is familiar to the Orang Kuala. For example, in the
event of an economic crisis, they possess knowledge and
skills related to the sea to secure economic resources if they
need to deal with economic problems. Natural disasters that
occur in coastal areas are also not seen as a threat but are
accepted as a matter that must be faced by those living on the
coast.
Reality is different from the views of Elfindri et al. (2005,
cited in Noviarti, Jahi, & Nor, 2011), who state that the
problems of a particular season, including natural disasters,
pose a threat to coastal communities. In the case of the Orang
Kuala, their lives in the marine environment (Amir Zal,
Redzuan, et al., 2012; Yuszaidy et al., 2009) allow them to
accept the difficulties as the Sea Orang Kualas. They do not
perceive those events as a threat but accept them as part of
their lives. Therefore, their views on sea events are different
from those of other communities.
The seasons change. The decline of marine resources due to
the change of seasons is the greatest threat reported by the
respondents (74.5%). The threat posed by the change of sea-
sons was indicated by the informant to refer to the state of the
tides. In all, 72.5% the respondents also said that they per-
ceived threats related to the occupation with the uncertainty
of the seasons. Both of these types of threat are intercon-
nected with each other. Based on Orang Kuala experience,
each state of the sea enables them to obtain a different type
of marine resource. For example, at low tide, they may be
able to get resources such as pumpun, sea worms, crabs, and
others. In such a circumstance, fish totals are declining.
When there are high tides, it is easy to acquire fish. However,
in the event of a storm or rough seas, marine products are
reduced: "Depend on a situation, if we can find the low-
water other things, crabs there too. But if the tide, many fish
we got. Storm? Fish to escape. Hahaha" (Informant A).
Concern for the threat of fluctuating prices (quantity of
products in the seasons) was displayed by 62.7% of the
respondents, and concern for market volatility with the sea-
sons was displayed by 51% of the respondents. Informants
described the threat of market uncertainty with regard to the
seasons as making it problematic to acquire certain resources
such as fish to meet market demand. This results in price
increases. However, typically high prices are not caused by
the Orang Kuala, but are associated with the exploitative
behavior of middlemen who manipulate seasonal
conditions:
Of course, if the storm, even fish can suck. We want to earn
money, look for the fish also available. The price is high. We go
up a bit. But many middlemen up (price). Pity also the Orang
Kuala who want to buy. But they already know the season
barring the unlikely even fish prices. (Informant C)
The seasons change, and the resultant decline in marine
resources and uncertain employment are the highest forms of
threat faced by the respondents. All forms of threat associ-
ated with nature are beyond the control of the Orang Kuala.
In the case of a natural disaster, although it is a threat beyond
their control, the Orang Kuala possess the knowledge and
skill to weather the event. However, the questionnaire indi-
cates a different attitude toward seasonal changes. The Orang
Kuala feel a lack of control due to changing elements that
pose a threat in each season. Both of these findings are incon-
sistent. It has been demonstrated that seasonal variation

poses a threat that results in socioeconomic changes. This
view is consistent with the view of Pakpahan et al. (2006),
who state that this problem occurs when connected with eco-
nomic interests.
Conclusion, Impact, and
Recommendations
Overall, community resources in the form of marine
resources can still be obtained by the Orang Kuala. This
allows them to continue life as usual. This reality can encour-
age the Orang Kuala to use the community resources as the
basis for the development of their communities. This
approach is consistent with the essence of community
development.
The types of threats faced by the community are trends,
shocks, and seasonal change. The study concluded that the
types of threats that occur are related to events that cannot be
controlled by the Orang Kuala. This includes the side effects
of the threats, such as social problems caused by economic
problems and indirect contact with other societies. However,
the forms of community development need to be considered
a possible threat in terms of a reduction in the opportunity to
take advantage of community resources, which include eco-
nomic, social, and political benefits. These resources should
be tapped for community development purposes. This means
that the forms of threat occur when an event reduces the
resources and opportunities to access community resources.
As summary, the most significant threat to the Orang Kuala
is the trend, consisting of the cost of living and social prob-
lems. This situation can be labeled as a vulnerable commu-
nity of capitals. However, in the context of the Orang Kuala,
the problem is not of their choosing. It occurs beyond their
control.
Thus, the Orang Kuala can choose to not depend solely on
existing community resources. This does not mean that they
have to stop using existing community resources. This action
is not in accordance with the ABCD approach. Instead, they
can increase the capacity of their community resources. The
Orang Kuala can take a lesson from Loza (2004), who states
how community capacity building is significant. This results
in an increase in the economic power of the community.
Even the act of increasing the capacity of the resources can
promote the occurrence of sustainable development. This
idea was seconded by Strigl (2003).
This effort is not difficult because there are findings
showing the ability of the Orang Kuala to accept the changes
necessary. For example, they do not consider technology a
threat but believe that new technology helps them to adapt
and overcome the negative stereotypes that have been
imposed on them by mainstream society. This article sug-
gests that the Orang Kuala could be supplied with new
human capital (knowledge and skills), whether by increasing
the capacity of existing human capital or by adding a differ-
ent human capital. This proposal is based on the reality that
life-threatening changes in coastal communities are a matter
that cannot be avoided because it is not under the control of
the Orang Kuala.
The action is, however, more effective when there is a
consistent effort from the government. Through policies and
programs, the government can encourage Orang Kuala to
raise existing community capitals, for example, by introduc-
ing Orang Kuala specific courses and encouraging them to
join the same to improve the capacity of their community
capitals. In this way, they not only preserve their identity as
the Sea People but also strengthen their economy with the
economic remuneration. These efforts can produce a social
innovation among Orang Kuala. As for a long-term recom-
mendation, the efforts to develop OrangAsli potential should
be evaluated based on the specific context, which is based on
a different ethnic background. Each Orang Asli is living in
different environments and has specific identity. This reality
paved specific threat and need to be addressed based on the
specificity of the Orang Asli background.
