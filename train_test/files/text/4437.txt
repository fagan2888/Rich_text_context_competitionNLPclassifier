A Critical Analysis of Debates Around
Mental Health Calls in the
Prehospital Setting
Polly Christine Ford-Jones, MA, AEMCA1
and Claudia Chaufan, MD, PhD1,2
Abstract
Paramedics, health care workers who assess and manage health concerns in the prehospital setting, are increasingly providing
psychosocial care in response to a rise in mental health call volume. Observers have construed this fact as "misuse" of
paramedic services, and proposed as solutions better triaging of patients, better mental health training of paramedics, and
a greater number of community mental health services. In this commentary, we argue that despite the ostensibly well-
intentioned nature of these solutions, they shift attention and accountability away from relevant public policies, as well as from
broader economic, social, and political determinants of mental health, while placing responsibility on those requiring services
or, at best, on the health care system. We also argue that the perspective of paramedics, who are exposed to, and interact
with, individuals in their everyday environments, has the potential to inform a better, structural and critical, understanding
of the factors driving the rise in psychosocial crises in the first place. Finally, we suggest that a greater engagement with the
political and social determinants of mental health would lead to preventing, rather than primarily reacting to, these crises
after the fact.

Commentary
Introduction
Paramedics work within emergency medical services
(EMS), providing prehospital care and transportation to
facilities providing this care, as well as assessing and man-
aging both life-threatening and non­life-threatening emer-
gencies in the prehospital setting.1 Increasingly, paramedics
are being called to address patients' mental health con-
cerns.2,3 Current debates around increasing mental health
call volume for paramedics, in the media as well as in aca-
demia, identify several factors as problematic, such as inap-
propriate use of paramedic services for mental health and
other psychosocial issues, insufficient paramedic mental
health training, and deficiencies in community mental
health services.
Critical analyses of health issues have problematized
dominant narratives around obesity,4 diabetes,5,6 and heart
disease,7 calling attention to the lack of acknowledgment in
these narratives of the political and social determinants of
health. In contrast, dominant narratives around mental health
calls in EMS (hereafter paramedicine/paramedic services), a
relatively neglected field in the health care literature, have
merited scant critical analysis.
In this commentary we address this gap, drawing broadly
from the political economy of health8,9 and critical discourse
analysis literature10 to examine the debate around the
observed increase in mental health calls in the prehospital
setting. We do not attempt a systematic, empirical analysis.
Rather, our goal is to draw from selected examples, from the
academic literature and the media (from the English-
speaking world), to shed light on what is missing in domi-
nant discourses around the uses (and "abuses") of paramedic
services for mental health calls. We have a special interest
in underscoring the relevance of these omissions for mental
health practice, policy and equity, in highlighting the poten-
tial contributions of the experience of paramedic profes-
sionals to these fields, and in expanding the debate around
the political and social determinants of mental health to
include a relatively neglected area in the provision of health
services.

2 INQUIRY
The Role of Paramedics in Psychosocial
Care
Paramedics provide care in the field, en route to the hospital,
and increasingly in community settings. Paramedics' scope
of practice varies by region and level of training1,11; it
includes both basic (eg, medication administration) and spe-
cialized (eg, intubation) interventions, as well as direct trans-
port to facilities for suspected cardiovascular emergencies
(eg, myocardial infarctions), among other skills and proto-
cols.1 Skillsets and structure of paramedic services vary both
within and between countries and continue to develop. This
includes traditional response to acute emergencies, commu-
nity health care and primary health care roles, as well as
addressing more chronic health conditions, prevention, and
education.11
Paramedicine is seen as a hybrid of skillsets from a vari-
ety of occupations and, given the profession's relative
infancy, its scope of practice is likely to evolve.12
Increasingly, paramedics are addressing calls involving a
significant component of what has been labeled psycho-
logical and social care. Given the diversity of environ-
ments and protocols under which paramedics work, there
is undoubtedly variation in the frequency and management
of this type of care. Here however, we draw on media from
the Canadian context and paramedic academic literature
from the Canadian, US, UK, and Australian contexts to
inform this discussion.
Paramedics are often a first point of access to the health
care system, and one of few health professionals who
encounter patients in their everyday settings. Paramedics
encounter patients from diverse socio-economic back-
grounds and may be a patient's only access to health care.13
Although their interventions are usually responses to identi-
fiable medical conditions, there exists a great variety of non-
medical, often labeled "psychosocial," situations to be
managed in the prehospital setting, as well as information to
be gained from this exposure.14 Among situations resulting
in calls to paramedic services, "mental health calls" are
increasingly frequent3 and these patients are identified as
repeat users of prehospital ambulance care.15 Despite its rel-
evance and magnitude, the academic literature on the subject
is limited.
Paramedic Services in the News
A purposive sample of articles illustrates the dominant narra-
tive around paramedicine and mental health calls in the
media. One recurring theme is the issue of high, as well as
increasing, volume of mental health calls. For instance, one
article informs readers that mental health calls make up more
than 40% of ambulance runs,16 another that mental health
calls make up the bulk of paramedic calls,17 and yet another
that there is an "aspect" of mental health crisis in every call.18
These articles suggest that the number of mental health calls
is greater than it was in some usually undefined past, thus
burdensome on paramedic services. In addition, the media
refer to mental health calls as a "misuse" of the emergency
medical service system.16 They argue that these calls pull
resources away from other emergencies, and that at any rate
paramedic services are not the appropriate resource to
address these calls.19
Another recurring theme is the need for more and better
mental health training for paramedics. Indeed, paramedics
are said to have minimal mental health training and it is
generally felt that they would benefit from more. One
media article reports on a paramedic who states that much
of his knowledge of managing mental health calls comes
from experience on the road rather than professional train-
ing. The article also notes that most paramedic training
involves physical findings on assessment, whereas physical
findings are largely nonexistent in mental health calls. It
therefore suggests that more mental health training may
benefit the mental health of paramedics themselves as well
as patients.18 Yet another news article presents the findings
of a coroner's inquest that includes recommendations for
additional sections on psychiatric training within the para-
medic Basic Life Support Patient Care Standards manual,
as well as for further training of paramedics in the use of
sedatives.20 Training of paramedics in basic self-defense is
also deemed necessary so as to better manage aggressive
patients during mental health calls.17
Yet another theme is the need for more mental health
services in the community. One news article reports that
the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), a commu-
nity health authority, is considering the establishment of
a 24-hour crisis center for those struggling with mental
health and addictions, and is also calling for more thera-
pists.19 An article on Thunder Bay, the Canadian city with
the highest number of mental health calls per capita in the
province of Ontario, states that more paramedics and
ambulances will not solve the problem of increasing
mental health emergencies, and calls instead for a more
holistic approach to the problem, as well as for greater
government funding for community mental health
services.16
Paramedic Services in the Academic
Literature
In the academic literature, key concerns within the dominant
narrative include the downplaying of the urgency of mental
health issues within emergency medicine, the deinstitution-
alization of mental health patients without proper compensa-
tory community mental health services, and an (over)
emphasis on biomedical, to the detriment of psychosocial,
aspects of health during the training of paramedics. Thus,
one discussion of predictors of demand for prehospital care
notes that emergency departments do not necessarily con-
sider mental health problems to be life-threatening
Ford-Jones and Chaufan 3
emergencies, but rather problems often related to routine
("non-urgent") needs. It also identifies deinstitutionalization
over several decades as having played a critical role in
increasing mental health call volumes, by shifting patients
serviced within institutions toward community settings that
are ill-prepared to meet their needs.15
Other identified problems include overuse--often labeled
"abuse"--of paramedic services, by patients struggling with
mental health issues and improper identification and transfer
to adequate services of patients with mental health issues.3
Researchers thus recommend restructuring emergency men-
tal health care systems3 and further addressing mental health
calls in the training of paramedics, an approach that the pro-
fession supports.21-23
Last, the academic literature suggests that the increasing
psychosocial component of calls requires moving beyond
traditional, biomedically oriented training and assessments
based largely on physical findings.12 It also recommends that
alternatively, paramedic services may consider including a
social worker to address patients'psychosocial needs so as to
allow paramedics to focus on their field of expertise, that is,
emergency medical care.14
What Is Missing in Dominant
Approaches?
In the former sections, we have attempted to characterize
the dominant narrative concerning mental health calls in
paramedic services. We now move on to discuss what is
missing in this narrative, what the implications of these
omissions are for practice, policy, and equity in mental
health, and how the paramedic profession can contribute to
expanding the debate toward a greater acknowledgment of
the political and social determinants of health. We begin by
noting that properly addressing a greater than ordinary or
desirable volume of "mental health" calls requires that we
understand what constitutes a patient with "mental ill-
ness." The terms are not explicitly defined in the literature,
although without a clear understanding of what counts as
health and what counts as illness, significant challenges
for establishing effective and appropriate health care pol-
icy emerge.24,25
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental
health as "a state of well-being in which every individual
realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal
stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is
able to make a contribution to her or his community."26 We
would like to suggest that were the WHO to include the
social, cultural, and political contexts that create inequi-
ties, this definition would lead us to question what counts
as normal or abnormal states, and concomitantly what
counts as normal or abnormal responses to a given set of
circumstances.25
This is rarely, if ever the case in debates around mental
health calls in paramedic services. Put another way, it is not
asked whether the behaviors and emotional states of the pro-
tagonists of these calls are not actually reasonable responses
to increasing social exclusion, as the neoliberal state retreats
from providing more basic social services toward promoting
expanding opportunities for capital accumulation.8 We pro-
pose that given the already extraordinary amount of research
conducted, and understanding achieved, around the social
determinants of mental health,27 interrogating the nature of
mental health and illness would lead us to question the label-
ing of at least certain individuals as suffering from "mental
health" issues, or as having placed a "mental health" call.
Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the wide range of reported
proportions of mental health calls in paramedic services--
from as low as 5% to "a component of mental crisis on every
call"19--speaks to the significant ambiguity in what consti-
tutes a mental health call rather than a reasonable response to
a stressful situation.
Questioning dominant definitions of mental illness and
conceptions about the nature of mental health calls also leads
us to problematize claims that these calls are a "burden" or
even a "misuse" of the prehospital system.3,28 Such claims
assume that paramedic services are not the most appropriate
way to address this issue, and we agree. Our point however,
again, is that construing mental health calls as a "problem" of
individual patients burdening or misusing the system rather than
of situational and broader processes that may be driving these
calls blames the victim.29 By this we mean that construing men-
tal health calls thus draws our attention toward "mentally
unhealthy" individuals, or "adequate/inadequate" paramedic
services at best, and away from broader conditions and their
underlying power dynamics that drive individuals' need for
assistance. Attention on individual factors affecting health
reflects the concept of "lifestyle drift," that is, the tendency of
policy initiatives to refer broadly to social conditions that
affect people's lives and health yet conclude by proposing
action at the level of health behaviors. The concept is readily
applicable also to mental health. A focus primarily on lifestyle
drift or individual behaviors draws attention away from the
driving forces behind such behaviors and away from the root
of the problems resulting in health inequities.30,31
Yet another issue we would like to explore and problema-
tize is the suggestion that increased mental health call vol-
umes for paramedics should be addressed with further
training18,20-22,32 and more and better mental health services
in the community.3,14,16,19 Surely both suggestions are use-
ful--all else equal. However, not everything else is equal:
Further training of paramedics, or more and better commu-
nity mental health services, however necessary, will do little
to improve the living conditions of the increasing number of
persons placing "mental health calls" when, overwhelmed by
these conditions, they find nowhere else to turn to but to
"emergency" medical services. In fact, interventions that fail
to consider these broader, structural issues, may have unin-
tended, undesirable consequences: Such is the case of dein-
stitutionalization, which led to shifting the burden of care
4 INQUIRY
from institutions to families and communities.33,34 In sum,
mental health training and community mental health services
undoubtedly warrant further attention, but repeated appeals
to more or better training and more or better services makes
the reality of living conditions less visible and drives the
search for solutions away from the policy and political
levels.
Moving Beyond "Crisis" to the Political
and Social Determinants of Mental
Health
Evidence for the social and political determinants of health
and mental health is overwhelming. It can be traced as far
back as, if not earlier than, the 19th century,5,35 and continues
to grow,36-38 even if it remains unaddressed in practice.
Mental health disorders are more prevalent among individu-
als living in poverty, experiencing material and emotional
distress in early childhood, with precarious or no employ-
ment, lacking adequate housing, and so forth.39-41 There is
little doubt that these conditions are neither "natural" nor
inevitable, and that action on the social determinants of men-
tal health improves mental health and well-being.41 When
such a wide range of social conditions significantly affects
mental health outcomes, health policy must engage, yet
reach beyond, the health care system.39 However, ideological
barriers continue to place the source of distress largely or
solely at the level of individuals, shifting responsibility away
from social and political structures.10,25,42
Extant debates around the role of paramedicine in psycho-
social care and around the increase in mental health calls, in
the media as well as in academia, present an ostensibly well-
intentioned discourse that rightly brings attention to a grow-
ing concern within a usually neglected, and relatively new,
field within the health professions: paramedicine. Yet the
debates currently dominating the field draw attention away
from the structural inequalities that are driving a large, and
increasing, number of "mental health" or psychosocial calls,
and risk framing what is a reasonable response to structural
oppression as "abnormal" emotions and behaviors.25 We sug-
gest that a better approach is to engage with these broader
structures and determinants affecting mental health, and
work toward preventing mental health and psychosocial cri-
ses instead of reacting to them after the fact.
That being said, and having identified an increase in men-
tal health calls in the prehospital setting, paramedics can help
shed light on the living conditions and experiences generat-
ing much of this increase. Drawing on their experience as
they interact with individuals in their everyday circum-
stances, they can join other practitioners in the critical health
tradition by informing the understanding of these circum-
stances, and shift the conversation toward addressing their
root causes. As the role and scope of practice of paramedics
continue to evolve, paramedics are moving beyond acute
physical health care and have the potential to become increas-
ingly involved in both health and social advocacy as has
already begun to occur and continue to shed light on the rela-
tionship between social context and health,11 including men-
tal health. This perspective may aid in working toward
problematizing claims about the "mental illness" of individ-
uals living in poverty and other challenging circumstances so
as to ensure that their distress is not decontextualized or
depoliticized.
