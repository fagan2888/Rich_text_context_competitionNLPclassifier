Abstract
Recent European studies present persistently critical views of the under performance of
government-backed venture capital (GVC) schemes when compared to their private sector
counterparts. However, they assess the performance of outmoded funding models and fail to
contextualise the economic development role of these schemes. This paper provides a
contemporary assessment of the business impacts of the UK government's flagship Enterprise
Capital Funds VC scheme in addressing the sub-£2 m equity finance gap facing young potential
high-growth businesses requiring investments. Supply and demand-side evidence is presented
from interviews with ECF fund managers, alternative private VCs, industry experts and surveys
of successful and unsuccessful scheme applicants. We find that, despite the limitations of mid-
scheme evaluation, Enterprise Capital Funds are addressing the UK equity gap and delivering
business employment, revenue and innovation impacts. However, further progress is required
in order to achieve optimal business exits and sustainable early stage private VC system impacts.

Introduction
It is notable that many of the most flourishing venture capital (VC) markets globally are
catalysed by government support (Lerner, 2009, 2010, 2011). Since the global financial crisis
(GFC), intensification in government VC (GVC) scheme investment has occurred, driven by
governments' desire to support innovation and business growth (Lerner, 2010; Mazzucato
and Penna, 2014), to plug seed and early stage investment gaps created by retrenchment to
later stage funding by bank debt and private VC finance (Cowling et al., 2012; North et al.,
2013; Wilson and Silva, 2013) and attempts to attract private investment, enhanced by
increasing ability to attract foreign inward investment in the information age (Hopp,
2010; Lerner, 2010; Lerner et al., 2005).
In Europe, public investment in VC doubled to 1.6bnE between 2007 and 2011, increasing its
share from 9.9% to 39.1% (EVCA, 2013). In the UK, Murray (2007) has suggested that since

the Dotcom crisis, the proportion of government funding in seed and early stage VC increased,
whilst Mason and Pierrakis (2013) indicated a rise from 20% to 68% between 2000 and 2008.
This trend has most likely continued post GFC, given that British Venture Capital Association
(BVCA, 2013) member seed and early stage VC investments in 2011 and 2012 were just £350m,
similar to 1999 prior to the Dotcom bubble. This phenomenon alongside recent large-scale data
which cast questions over the value of GVC schemes (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014; Munari and
Toschi, 2015), makes it apposite to take a closer look at a major European GVC scheme.
This paper assesses the business impacts of the UK government's Enterprise Capital Funds
(ECFs), the UK's foremost GVC scheme addressing the equity finance gap facing young,
potential, high-growth, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) requiring investments
up to £2m. Established in 2006, ECFs have received £840m UK government investment,
including a £400m three-year extension tranche announced in Autumn 2014,1 thus far
creating 18 rolling 10 year limited life funds. As Lerner (2002) and Tokila and Haapanen
(2009) suggest, scheme assessment should consider its aims and objectives, whilst Greene
(2009) highlights the need for thorough mixed methods approaches to more fully
understand the impacts. The ECF has a dual rationale to plug the early stage finance gap
and develop potential high-growth SMEs, and to stimulate the creation of new early stage VC
funds, providing demonstration effects that encourage other private VCs into early stage
investment, developing a sustainable VC ecosystem in the UK. Whilst the second aim meets
Lerner's (2010) requirement for GVCs to catalyse private sector VC ecosystems and withdraw,
this paper focuses on how the ECF model impacts on businesses, addressing Colombo et al.
(2014) in examining how effective the design of contemporary GVC funds are.
The paper draws on empirical interim ECF evaluation demand and policy supply-side
evidence in early 2014, including ECF fund managers, other contemporary UK seed and early
stage risk equity financiers and views from the wider business support services ecosystem. The
focus is on a survey of 75 SMEs assisted by ECFs, since their inception in 2006, examining
the evolving design and approach of the ECFs and their impacts on business development. This
spans a period immediately prior to the GFC during which the first `pathfinder' group of eight
ECFs were established, between 2006 and 2008, and post the onset of the GFC when the newer
group of six ECFs included in the study were established between 2010 and 2013.
The paper initially summarises the theoretical context relating to GVC policy
intervention, scheme design, and the evolution of the ECFs, before presenting the
methodology and key ECF business impact findings. It concludes by discussing the
findings and considering how ECFs might achieve their longer-term aim of establishing a
sustainable seed and early stage UK private sector-led VC market.
Theoretical context
GVC theories can be defined as predominantly supply-side relating to the rationale for
government intervention, addressing an equity gap and developing a VC ecosystem (Lerner's,
2010 vision of developing professional VC support services), and the related design and
implementation of schemes, addressing the fit for purpose question. Demand side theories
relate to the entrepreneurial ecosystem and whether there is an adequate supply of suitable
young investible potential high-growth businesses (Mason and Brown's enterprise pipeline, 2013).
Supply side rationale
The rationale for government support to young potential high-growth businesses is
predicated on the certification hypothesis, suggesting that policies can pick winners, or in
Baldock 1557
the case of co-funded public­private investment schemes, can pick winning partners (Baldock
and Mason, 2014) who can affectively select businesses and assist growth that would
otherwise not take place. Colombo et al. (2014) also find that government funding may
signal quality to other private investors, generating a crowding-in effect. Since potential
high-growth firms are associated with innovation, revenue and job generation (Audretsch,
2002; ERC, 20142; Nesta, 2009b; OECD, 2002), economic growth and economic rebalancing
through development of high value export products and services (HM Treasury and BIS,
2011), GVC schemes have come to the fore in the post GFC period (Wilson and Silva, 2013),
particularly focusing on seed and early stage development where external financing for these
businesses appears most problematic.
Since Macmillan (1931) first estimated a finance gap at below £200,000, equating to below
£5m today, the evidence is that the gap relating to entrepreneurial risk finance varies in
intensity and scale over time, as demand and supply alter, with supply-side intervention
policies able to narrow the gap (Lerner, 2005, 2010; Murray, 2007). Deakins and Freel
(2012) define the equity gap as between the upper limits of business angel finance and the
minimum capital requirement for the public equity market, considered to range from
£250,000 to £2 m in the UK in the mid-2000s when the ECFs were established (Murray,
2007). By the late 2000s, evidence of the trend for private VCs to retreat to later stage
investments suggested that the gap had extended beyond £2 m to over £10 m (Rowlands,
2009; SQW Consulting, 2009), whilst as the recession took hold in 2009­2010 blockages in
the supply of business angel finance suggested that the gap was also encroaching into the
seed and start-up finance stage at below £250,000 (Johnston, 2009; Mason et al., 2010).
The finance gap is caused by market imperfections (Modigliani and Miller, 1958) with
information asymmetries considered a major cause (Akerlof, 1970; Myers and Majluf, 1984)
due to the unequal knowledge exchange between financiers and businesses. This is particularly
problematic for young high-growth potential businesses without track records to demonstrate
their market traction and value, and often lacking sufficient collateral with their true value
being associated with intangible intellectual property (IP) (Hsu, 2004). These businesses
require risk equity finance, but face problems of adverse selection and moral hazard
(Carpenter and Peterson, 2002) resulting from the prohibitively high cost of due diligence
for relatively small­scale seed and early stage investments and reflected in the resultant
poor performance of these equity markets in recent years (BVCA, 2013; Mason et al., 2010).
The temporal changes in the supply of finance are captured in the finance escalator model
(Nesta, 2009a), which incorporates Berger and Udell's (1998) concept of declining
information opacity of young firms as they progress through the business development
cycle. This suggests that as businesses develop and gain market traction, a different and
wider range of finance (debt and equity) become available. The escalator model can be used
to demonstrate finance gaps and pinpoint where GVCs can make most impact (Baldock and
Mason, 2015; Gill, 2010; Harrison, 2014; North et al., 2013).
Colombo et al. (2014) raise one further important market failure hypothesis that GVCs can
address social pay-offs and externalities that private transactions take no account of. They
view this as contentious, requiring careful attention to scheme design and context, since it may
typically take place in peripheral, less favoured thin markets and can lead to underperforming
investments and crowding out of private investors (Armour and Cumming, 2006).
Ecosystem and demand side theories
The development of a more efficient seed and early stage financing escalator, is pyramidal,
based on a sufficient pipeline supply of young investible businesses (Mason and Brown, 2013;
1558 Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 34(8)
Mason and Pierrakis, 2013). This requires a carefully integrated policy to develop the VC
and equity finance and entrepreneurial ecosystems (Hughes, 2009; Hwang and Horowitt,
2012), taking into account both the supply-side mechanism and also the potential demand-
side failures in relation to investment readiness (Mason and Kwok, 2010).
From a supply-side perspective, Hall and Lerner (2010) find that private VCs can address
funding gaps, overcoming information asymmetries, adverse selection and moral hazard
through their screening, monitoring and management support processes. However, in an
under-developed market where there are gaps in VC investment, Colombo et al. (2014)
suggest that GVC can attract, train, nurture, and raise the quality and volume of private
VC. Lerner (2010) finds it essential for GVC schemes to attract skilled private investors and
embed an early stage VC investment culture and support service network (e.g. specialist
accountants, lawyers, advisors).
From the demand side, developing the resource based knowledge of small firm
management is essential (Baldock et al., 2015; Mac an Bhaird, 2010; North et al., 2013),
alongside broadening the pecking order financial preferences of entrepreneurs (Myers and
Majluf, 1984; Norton, 1991) and tackling signalling issues which may particularly affect the
ability of entrepreneurs in more peripheral areas to find and obtain equity funding (Amini
et al., 2012; Mueller et al., 2014). Whilst this paper focuses on the supply-side, the extent of
intermediary knowledge and visibility of ECFs to entrepreneurs is discussed.
Design theories
There would appear to be a strong justification for public policy intervention in order to
address market failure, but policy interventions require careful consideration of potential
pitfalls (Brander et al., 2008; Colombo et al., 2014; Lerner, 2010; Murray and Lingelbach,
2009) which may result from agency failures (Akerlof, 1976) from poor management and
policy making. In recent times, there has been a proliferation of GVC design theories,
drawing on global experiences in searching for the holy grail of an established private
sector-led early stage finance market which addresses the equity gap (e.g. Cumming, 2011,
2014; Lerner, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2011; Lerner et al., 2005; Mulcahy, 2013; Murray, 2007;
NAO, 2009; Pierrakis, 2010; Technopolis, 2011). Whilst it is important to take into account
different institutional environments (Florida and Kenney, 1988), very few GVC schemes
have been deemed successful (Brander et al., 2008; Colombo et al., 2014; Lerner, 2009).
The most successful in terms of developing early stage private VC investment and generating
successful exits have been the US Small Business Investment Company (established 1958),
Israeli Yozma funds (established, 1993), and Australian Innovation Investment Fund
(established, 1997). Many more recently established funds have not had sufficient time for
proper assessment.
An extensive review of GVC studies suggests that the more successful schemes are private
VC led, attract co-investment, inward investment and experienced VCs who up-skill local
VCs over time, are time limited but extendable to facilitate optimal exit timing, monitor, and
adjust to changing market requirements, have sufficient scale of funding and target market,
remain focused and avoid mission creep, and operate within a wider supportive
entrepreneurial and financing ecosystem which takes into account exit market
opportunities. These points are developed below.
First, Murray (2007) recognised GVC schemes' shift towards private sector-led `hybrid'
co-funding arrangements, which Colombo et al. (2014) characterise as a shift from direct
funding which might require private match funding (e.g. Finnish Industry Investment's
direct funding to businesses) to private VC-led co-funding (e.g. the UK ECFs) or fund of
Baldock 1559
fund structures (e.g. UK Innovation Investment Fund). Lerner (2002) questioned the
legitimacy of government officials running funding schemes, noting the potential for
political distortion and propping up favoured businesses. By the end of the decade,
Lerner (2010) strongly advocated a private sector-led approach investing in viable
businesses. He highlights the Israeli Yozma funds3 and their ability to attract foreign
investment and skilled fund managers to provide a demonstrator effect for other private
fund managers to follow. A key part of the private sector-led approach is the ability to
leverage co-investment funding from the private sector, increasing fund size and engendering
a private sector investment dynamic. Recent large data European (Grilli and Murtinu, 2014)
and UK (Munari and Toschi, 2015) studies point to the importance of experienced hands-on
private sector fund managers and support the view that successful VCs have niche ``hard to
imitate'' knowledge of sectors and stages (BIS, 2011) and are persistent performers who build
on their experience over time (Gompers et al., 2010; Zarutskie, 2010).
Second, that government intervention should add value to the market (Wallsten, 2000)
and withdraw when its job is complete in order to avoid private sector reliance and crowding
out (Lerner, 2010). In this respect, Lerner strongly advocates time limited schemes (e.g. the
10-year Limited Partnership (LP) model) driven by private sector performance dynamics
which avoid evergreen fund pitfalls of persistently funding poor performing portfolio
businesses, as exhibited in Murray et al.'s (2009) GVC review of Finland. Lerner et al.
(2005) acknowledge that achieving this performance balance requires regular monitoring
to avoid counter arguments that private sector-led GVC potentially cherry pick the best
company investments, crowd out the private sector, distort and inflate market valuations,
and fail to address wider economic development objectives, such as regional development
(Brander et al., 2008; Da Rin et al., 2006; Leleux and Surlemont, 2003; Oakey, 2003).
Third, the required size and scale of GVC activity is widely debated. UK and European
VC funds have been dwarfed by their US counterparts; US funds distribute over five times
the value from less than four times the number of funds (Ernst and Young, 2010). The
implication is that UK GVC funds have insufficient scale to achieve Markowitz's (1952)
portfolio size optimisation. Technopolis (2011) European VC report recommended that
funds require sufficient size to follow-on invest in their best portfolio companies and
avoid forced early exits at sub-optimal value, suggesting a minimum fund size of £40 m
for a seed or early stage VC. In this respect, the ability of GVCs to achieve timely fund
cycle development, raising investment for second funds (Gompers and Lerner, 2001), is
crucial and appears to have been badly hampered across Europe by declining early stage
investment post GFC (Dittmer et al., 2014). Dittmer et al. (2014) also suggest that a possible
solution to European GVC scale is to operate across borders on a pan-European scale, as
evidenced by the UK Innovation Investment Fund (BIS, 2012).
Fourth, GVC funds require a wide enough focus to meet a sufficiently good pipeline of
investible businesses. Reports on the failings of UK (NAO, 2009) and Finnish (Murray et al.,
2009) regional GVC funds highlight their being too small in scale and narrowly focused into
regions to generate sufficient critical mass of investment and returns. This suggests that funds
which are sector- or stage-specific are likely to locate in high density clusters, such as
London's Tech City seed VCs, or to syndicate and work with other VCs and investors
such as the recently emerging angel capital groups (Baldock and Mason, 2015) in order to
facilitate inter-regional and international investments (Hopp, 2010; Hopp and Rieder, 2011).
Fifth, GVC schemes require a long-term minimum 10-year view (Lerner, 2010) with
flexibility to extend further. Whilst Lerner advocates regular monitoring to ensure that
funds are performing their intended roles and to avoid mission creep to safer later stage
investments (Gill, 2015; Murray et al., 2009), it is equally important that government avoids
1560 Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 34(8)
micro managing and allows GVC funds to develop over sufficient time. The trend towards a
doubling in early stage VC portfolio exit timetables, from around four years in the early 2000s
to around eight years post GFC (Axelson and Martinovic, 2012; Baldock and North, 2016,
forthcoming; CfEL, 2013; Mason and Harrison, 2015; Pierrakis, 2010) has rekindled debates as
to whether 10-year LP GVCs will be able to allow their portfolio firms to fully mature and avoid
early sales and potential share value dilution. Mason and Brown (2013) point to the importance
of an exit market, for trade sales and initial public offerings (IPOs) (Baldock, 2015) in delivering
blockbuster VC exits which will lead to recycled funds and new private VC entry.
Finally, GVC operates within a holistic entrepreneurial financing ecosystem which
supports enterprise development and appropriate funding supply (Hughes, 2009). From
the VC scheme design perspective, Lerner (2010) stresses the importance of developing
support and promotional networks, making them visible and accessible, linking different
types of finance and financial intermediaries and avoiding duplication. This emphasises the
umbrella role of state investment banks such as the German KfW4 in operating technology
funds (Grunderfonds) and managing the evolving finance escalator, highlighting the role that
the new British Business Bank can play in achieving this in the UK (Breedon, 2012;
Cumming, 2011; Gill, 2015; Mazzucato and Penna, 2014; Van der Schans, 2015).
The role of ECFs
The ECFs, introduced in 2006, mark an important advance in UK GVC schemes, notably
the previous small-scale public-led Regional Venture Capital Funds (Colombo et al., 2014).
They represent a significant increase in the size and scale of funding and a concerted effort to
deliver private VC-led co-investment funds.
Between 2000 and 2012, the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) placed
£600m in 34 VC funds, financing over 1000 businesses (CfEL, 2013), with private funding
leverage of 0.5 Â which was set to rise to almost 1 Â during the lifetime of the current
schemes. Increased private funding leverage results from the increase in co-funding schemes
(Murray, 2007), mainly relating to the ECFs, UK Innovation Investment Fund (UKIIF)5
and Angel Co-investment Fund (ACF), all designed to stimulate private sector investment to
increase fund size and generate a private sector-led fund performance dynamic (Lerner, 2010).
From establishment, the ECFs have had two main objectives:6 first, to provide gap
funding for potential high-growth SMEs, mainly in seed and early stage development
requiring £250,000 to £2 m; second, to provide a demonstration model for early stage
institutional VCs, by establishing a UK early stage VC ecosystem and encouraging new
private fund managers into the market, effectively addressing recommendations for
private sector-led public funds (Lerner et al., 2005). These key objectives have not
changed over time, although the individual funding models have evolved with greater
focus from 2010 on seed and earlier stage VC.
The funds require a minimum of one third private investment, restricting private
individual investment to 50% of the private funding contribution to broaden the private
investment base. They are not pari passu (as favoured by EU schemes), offering an up-side
priority private investor return7 to encourage improved fund management performance, as
favoured by Lerner et al. (2005) and Jaaskelainen et al. (2007) to encourage competent early
stage private investors. The funds are formed under 10-year Limited Partnership (LP) status,
with options to extend up to 12 years, a feature which complies with Lerner's (2010)
requirements for GVCs to have flexibility to enable maximisation of their portfolio exits.
The UK government provided £240 m in 2006 for the initial eight pathfinder ECFs,
£200 m in 2010 for eight further funds, and £400 m for Autumn 2014­2017. The recent
Baldock 1561
rise in the scale of ECF funding continues the trend in increasing UK GVC scheme funding
since 2000. It demonstrated the UK government's commitment to develop the seed and early
stage VC market and followed negotiations leading to the EU's January 2014 increase in the
state aid limit (EC, 2014a) from £2 m to £5 m on initial investments into portfolio companies,
alongside increasing follow-on funding to 15mE capped at 15% of fund value (rising from
10%) and with the public funding limit doubling to £50 m for individual funds. This scaling-
up meets the recommendations for larger scale European funds to adequately facilitate
follow-on funding and optimise business growth and exit values achieved (Rigos, 2011;
Technopolis, 2011).
ECF funds have increased in scale over time (Table 1), rising from an average £26.875 m
for the eight pathfinder funds to £41.075 m for the eight second tranche funds, reaching the
scale recommended by Technopolis (2011) for a sustainable GVC funding cycle. The funds
are individual, mainly serving the seed and early stage UK VC markets, and include
generalist sector agnostic and specialist sector funds, notably in technology and IT. A
feature is the concentration of 16 out of 18 funds with headquarters within the London-
Oxbridge triangle, being drawn to the traditional bedrock of UK new technology companies,
with only three funds having offices in other regions covering the East Midlands and
Scotland. To some extent, this is off-set by the presence of European Regional
Development Fund regional VC funds, with a particularly strong presence in the North
East (£125 m), Yorkshire and the Humber (£100 m) and North West (£190 m) regions and
Wales (£150 m).8 The ECFs, with the exception of the more recent Notion fund, which has
additional European Investment Fund (EIF) investment, operate under the former EU state
aid limit of £2 m maximum initial investment into individual portfolio companies, with an
overall limit on follow-on funding of 10% of fund value in any one portfolio company. This
level of funding appears more suited to shorter horizon digitech investment (Baldock et al.,
2015; North et al., 2013) and is likely to be insufficient for long horizon capital intensive
R&D investment sectors such as life science (Rowlands, 2009; SQW Consulting, 2009) and
underpins the 2014 increase in EU state aid limits on follow-on funding.
There is further evidence of scheme evolution to adjust to changing post GFC market
requirements. The second tranche of ECFs, since 2010, contains innovative features designed
to enhance their impacts. These include the Notion fund being able to invest beyond the £2 m
state aid limit in European companies, with a minimum investment requirement into UK-
based companies aligned to the UK government's investment, which is similar to the
operation of the pan national UKIIF, supporting Lerner's (2010) globalisation of VC
thesis and that specialist sector-based funds can operate on a more effective scale if they
are international (Dittmer et al., 2014). There is also avoidance of the RVCFs' regional
market limitations in the 2000s (NAO, 2009). The Foresight ECF focuses on
Nottinghamshire businesses, receiving a bonus for local investments, but is also able to
invest in other parts of the UK in order to ensure a suitably sized and balanced portfolio.
Greater focus is given to seed and early stage investment in the second tranche ECFs,
following Lerner et al.'s (2005) recommendations that schemes have to be flexible to
adapt to the market's requirements, which in the UK post GFC saw a sharp decline in
seed and early stage investing (BVCA, 2013). The London-based Passion seed fund operates
as an accelerator in order to maximise portfolio funding opportunities and minimise due
diligence costs. This pure seed fund operates at well below the typical £250,000 lower
investment of most ECFs, focusing on seed and earlier stage syndication investments to
spread risk and make investments more attractive to later stage VCs (Hopp, 2010). It has
provided a seed funding model in London that other private VCs and angel capital groups
are following (e.g. EC1, Connect Ventures, Playfair Capital).
1562 Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 34(8)
A feature of the ECFs has been their stretch-funding provision to new fund managers.
This has attracted highly skilled European and US fund manager investors, enabling
capacity building of the sector in the UK and potential to achieve the funding scale
required to create a lasting scheme legacy, following Lerner et al.'s (2005) inward
investment investor skills recommendation. An important element of this VC development
cycle is generation of second funds (Gompers and Lerner, 2001) that can build on the initial
ECFs, providing further scale-up and ability for substantial follow-on funding to the best

performing portfolio companies. Notably, thus far, the scheme has seen just four second
funds created (Table 1) and these have taken six to eight years to appear after the first funds,
which may have resulted in some portfolio company funding shortfalls (examined later).
Over time, the ECF scheme aims to establish a sustainable private seed and early stage VC
market in the UK and then withdraw (as advocated by Lerner, 2010). However, the absence
of blockbuster exits, due to the poor exit markets in the post GFC period, has prevented
recycling of investment funds and signalling of widespread encouragement of private VCs
into these markets (Mason and Brown, 2013). As such there is no evidence of the scheme
withdrawing and it is likely to have an increasing presence in follow-on investments
upstream into the `series A-B' later phases in order to generate optimal exits (as predicted
by Cumming, 2011).
Approach and methodology
This paper uses a pragmatic mixed methods approach (Patton, 1990). Whilst predominately
based on a demand-side quantitative cross-sectional survey of 75 ECF-assisted businesses, it
also incorporates elements of longitudinal demand-side survey and qualitative case studies,
qualitative supply-side perspectives from VC fund managers and industry stakeholders, and
secondary scheme and industry data (outlined in Table 2). The aim is to provide a rounded
and triangulated analysis which provides insightful findings (Creswell, 2003).
Secondary data review included ECF scheme data (2006­2013) provided by the British
Business Bank and contextual parallel timescale VC industry data from the UK and Europe,
drawn from the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) and Preqin's private European
VC data set. The ECF desk study relates to 166 businesses funded through the first 12 funds
operational by the end of 2013. Additionally, surveys were undertaken in February 2014
with assisted and unassisted applicant businesses, ECF fund managers, other UK seed and
early stage investors, and industry stakeholders to provide triangulation of robust supply-
side and demand-side data (Brewer and Hunter, 1989). A caveat is the interim, largely cross-
sectional, nature of the research, at a stage when even the older funds operating for up to
eight years have yet to experience their plum stellar exits, which typically take place later
(Wiltbank, 2005). However, it has been possible to obtain a highly representative sample of
both demand- and supply-side data and cross section of stakeholder viewpoints.
A survey of 75 ECF recipient businesses, covering 12 active funds representing 45% of the
scheme's portfolio businesses, was undertaken using CATI recorded telephone interviews9
with senior managers. Surveyed businesses were randomly selected being restricted only by
survey time frame constraints and requests from fund managers that portfolio businesses
that had exited, closed or were undergoing exits should be excluded (representing
30 recipients). There were also 23 refusals, with the owner-managers of the remaining
38 businesses being unobtainable for interview within the survey time period of four
weeks in February 2014. Representativeness tests, Mann­Whitney two-tailed tests, reveal
no significant differences by sector, stage and region between the overall and surveyed
samples, noted in Table 2. Stage analysis adopted in the study complies with the standard
BVCA definitions (Appendix 1), adopted by the British Business Bank. Survey piloting on
five businesses ensured effective questioning and routing (Patton, 1990). Interviews took
30 minutes on average, covering a series of mainly closed pre-coded questions,
supplemented by strategic open questions to explore explanations and processes.
Questions addressed are: business profile (e.g. employment size, sector, stage, location);
external financing history and requirements; reasons for seeking ECF; ECF leverage,
additionality, displacement and attribution to post funding business performance (HM
1564 Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 34(8)
Treasury, 201310); exit timetables and strategies. Additionally, five case studies were
undertaken with failed ECF business write-downs, and supplementary counterfactual data
are drawn from short telephone interviews with five `dead deals' where applicants did not
receive ECF finance.
Longitudinal telephone survey work was undertaken with eight surviving ECF recipient
businesses between 2010 and 2013 (representing one fifth of the ECF business portfolio in
2010) and benchmarking reference is made to the BIS (2010) early assessment survey of
12 ECF recipient businesses (Marshall and Rossman, 1999).
In parallel, in early 2014, supply-side interviews were undertaken face-to-face or
by telephone with fund managers at all 14 current ECFs11 (including two new funds yet
to invest), using a semi-structured interview approach. These were supplemented by
13 interviews with other private VC, Venture Capital Trust (VCT) and angel capital
group fund managers operating in the UK seed and early stage equity markets along with
six interviews with industry stakeholder experts including the BVCA, UK Business Angel
Association (UKBAA), European Investment Fund (EIF), and St John's Innovation Centre,
Cambridge. These interviews focused on the role and effectiveness of delivery of the ECFs
and were recorded, transcribed, and checked by respondents to correct errors (Miles and
Huberman, 1994). Collectively, they provided an extensive contemporary assessment of the
UK's seed and early stage equity market and ECFs' current and likely future impacts.

ECFs' impacts on assisted businesses
Drawing mainly on empirical survey evidence collected in February 2014, the paper now
examines the ECFs' impacts on assisted businesses, alongside some counterfactual evidence
drawn from unsuccessful `dead deals'.
Meeting financing requirements
ECFs have addressed the equity financing needs of predominantly young, seed and early
stage businesses (Table 3). Comparing first the overall scheme data (n ¼ 166) with BVCA
member VC investment data (averaged over three years, 2010­2012, to avoid annual skew),
it is clear that ECFs are considerably more focused on seed and early stage VC investment
(65% compared to 38%) in meeting the private sector VC gap in the UK market. ECF's are
also contributing to rebalancing the UK economy with 35% of investments in industrial
sectors (e.g. advanced manufacturing, electrical engineering), but are comparatively
underrepresented in the health sector. ECFs relatively high proportion of investments in
digitech sectors (e.g. mobile applications and Internet-based activities) suggest a preference
for shorter horizon investing (almost half of ECF investments relate to technology/
telecommunications and consumer services, above the BVCA investors' 41%). ECF
investments are also even more concentrated into the London-Oxbridge triangle (London,
South East and East of England regions) than the BVCA investors (68% compared to 61%).
This reflects the UK's concentrations of high tech innovative businesses and VC financing
(Mason and Pierrakis, 2013), but also the operation of regional GVCFs in Scotland, Wales
and North of England (Baldock and Mason, 2015).
At the time of initial funding, the 75 surveyed recipient businesses were typically small
(median 15 employees) and pre or early trading. Funding was mainly sought for R&D, early
commercialisation, key staff recruitment (mainly R&D technicians and sales staff), and
working capital to fund growth (Table 4). One quarter referred to start-up capital
requirements, and overall the reasons for seeking ECF finance were heavily influenced by
the earlier stage requirements of the assisted businesses, with only one in 12 surveyed
businesses seeking funding for later stage acquisitions and management buy-outs/ins ­
these mainly coming from the earlier pathfinder funds with later stage focus. The
businesses typically described themselves as classical `gap funding' candidates: Too early
stage for institutional and corporate VC funding and requiring too much funding for
individual angels or angel networks to fund.
ECF investments cover seed and more substantive early stage `series A' and `B' rounds,
ranging from £20,000 seed investment to a share of a £9 m `series B' early commercialisation
round, with a mean of £964,000, and supplying 90% of the amount applied for. Average
ECF shareholdings were 19%, ranging from 4% to 60%, reflecting the high proportion of
early stage investments where business valuations were relatively low. The shift towards seed
and earlier stage investment by post 2010 ECFs has resulted in average recipient business
funding falling from £1.14 m pre-2010 to £547,000 post-2010.
Half of the surveyed recipients applied for alternative funding immediately prior to their
ECF application. This was proportionally lower amongst post GFC recipients (42%
compared to 59% pre GFC), suggesting increasing scarcity of suitable alternative
financing. They mainly approached equity sources, with half accepting offers. A further
one in 10 (seven cases) rejected offers, preferring the fund managers and growth
opportunities ECF offered. Some managers suggested ``alternative early stage corporate
VC would be restrictive in terms of product and market development'' stressing the ``meeting
1566 Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 34(8)
of minds'' required for equity investment (Baldock et al., 2015). Only 7% applied for bank
finance, none since 2010. It was mainly ``out of the question'', as the businesses were too
risky, being early stage without a trading track record of at least two years.
Although ECFs are not required to lever additional private funding, their initial
investments typically represented half of the overall funding round. Just 2% was
duplicative, where managers considered additional funds were raised ``instead of ECF'',
and they attributed almost half (46%; 1:0.46 ratio) as levered in by ECF. Post 2010, this
ratio rose to parity, mainly through angel and VCs syndication for very early stage
investments, supporting Hopp (2010) and Hopp and Rieder's (2011) syndication thesis.

Follow-on funding
Two-thirds (67%) of managers forecast follow-on investment requirements within the next
year; including 83% of those funded since 2010. Requirements range from £100,000 for
working capital to £20 m of private equity to fund substantial export growth in a life
science business, prior to an IPO. Follow-on investment requirements are substantial
(mean £3.9 m, median £3 m) to ensure growth momentum through early marketing to
establish (often global) market leading positions. Other recent research (Baldock et al.,
2015; Mason et al., 2013; North et al, 2013) suggests that timely follow-on funding is
crucial to securing market primacy and business growth. Most (75%) would seek
instititional VC and private equity, but around one-third will seek further ECF funding,
due to insufficient trading record or profitability to attract debt or private equity finance. A
clear benefit of ECF involvement was that 92% of the managers were more confident in their
ability to raise future finance.
Post GFC, ECF fund managers are making far greater provision for retaining sufficient
funds to provide follow-on funding for their better performing portfolio businesses. This is
particularly evident amongst more recently established seed and early stage ECFs. Notably,
Passion Capital's accelerator model initially invests small amounts into a large number of
businesses, holding back funds to enable follow-on funding of more substantial size
investments to better portfolio business performers, conforming to Markowitz' (1952)
principles. However, ECFs have been hampered by EU state aid restrictions, particularly
the 10% of fund size limit on individual portfolio business investments. This has resulted in
one in 10 surveyed recipient businesses being ``considerably constrained '' in raising follow-on
funding, supporting recommendations for larger more flexible GVC funds (Rigos, 2011;
Technopolis, 2011).
Additionality or displacement?
Fund managers and stakeholders unanimously agree that ECFs play an important role in
addressing the UK's sub-£2 m seed and early stage equity gap. There is little evidence of
funding displacement as few institutional VCs or VCTs operate at below £2 m (Table 5) in
the early stage UK market, typically specialising in expansion and MBO/MBI activities.
Exceptions include a few emerging seed VCs in London and Octopus VCT, a specialist early
stage investor.12 London (GLA, 213) has witnessed recent growth of seed investment

accelerators (e.g. Seedcamp13) and seed and early stage angel capital funds (e.g. #1 Seed,
Wren Capital). However, the consensus was that, whilst London's seed digitech market
showed signs of overheating, demand still outstripped supply (GLA, 2013), with `smart
money' ECF fund managers' expertise providing an important demonstration approach
(Lerner, 2010).
The surveyed ECF businesses (Table 6) exhibit high levels of project additionality, but
lower levels of funding additionality. This replicates other UK GVC scheme assessments,
with fund managers suggesting that their portfolio businesses typically overestimate their
fundraising ability (BIS, 2010, 2012). Whilst just one quarter of surveyed managers
considered that their ECF project would not have gone ahead without scheme funding,
three-fifths believe that obtaining alternative funding would have caused considerable
delays (typically 6­12 months), or project downscaling due to underfunding. Delays
reaching the market could severely jeopardise the ultimate success of the business, as
indicated in other early stage business finance studies (BIS, 2012; North et al., 2013).
The choice of VC and fund manager, or angel investor is also crucial in achieving a
``meeting of minds'' alignment of business development aims and appropriate level of
input into areas such as financial management, sales and marketing including export
market developments, networking contacts and linkages to further funding (Baldock
et al., 2015). This supports the Gompers et al. (2010) postulation of better performing
VCs possessing niche management and sector skills to deliver successful investment
outcomes. Conversely, our five case studies of ECF write-off investments demonstrate
that a breakdown in the entrepreneur ­ fund manager relationship is a key factor in failure.
Fund performance: interim assessment limitations
Interim assessments may occur too soon to adequately assess fund performance. Wiltbank
(2005) recognised early exit sales are often poorer performing `lemons', whilst `plum' best
performers typically take far longer to exit. Lerner (2010) also advocates a patient, long
game, approach which fund manager feedback supported. First, the top performing 10% of
10 Â plus investment multiple portfolio companies which determine the overall success of
funds can take 10 years to mature. Second, the GFC typically set back older portfolio
investments by two years, lengthening average exit times to 5­7 years, a finding supported
by Baldock and North's (2016, forthcoming) UK GVC longitudinal study14 and CfEL's15
(2013) fund managers report. This underlines the need for flexible fund management
timescales (Lerner, 2010) and favours the VCT and ACF evergreen approaches over
ECFs' LP agreements.
GFC impacts meant that older, pre-2010 ECF fund managers, initially aiming for at least
3 Â multiples now recognised they would do well to achieve between 2 and 3 Â . Most would

seek two-year fund extensions to manage their stronger performing portfolio companies to
optimal exit points, typically via trade sales. Internal rate of return (IRR) data fell below
expectations, supporting the view that, even after 6­8 years, it was still too early to
adequately evaluate fund performance. Benchmarking against Preqin's16 equivalent aged
European private VC funds offered limited value since these were self-reported,
potentially by the better performing, faster maturing, later stage focused funds. BVCA
member data revealed a median negative return on investment (À1.1%) for 38 funds
established between 2002 and 2008. Further benchmarking against the Scottish
Investment Bank's (SIB) portfolio of 378 companies, including the slightly older
established (2004) Scottish Co-investment Fund17 indicated similarly small numbers of
exits (8 in 2013­2014, compared with 13 recorded ECF exits). These findings underline
the need for more time for funds to mature after the GFC. Indeed, each ECF fund
manager forecast one or two portfolio companies that could achieve 10 Â multiples, but
these exit returns would not be taking place for several years.
Economic outputs
More satisfactory economic development evidence came from the survey of current portfolio
business performance outputs and projections, the fund managers' caveat being that
portfolio business managers' projections are optimistic and rarely achieved (BIS, 2010,
2012). Table 6 compares the actual performance of the 75 surveyed ECF recipient
businesses since initial funding until the time of interview in early 2014. Figures in
parenthesis represent those businesses funded since 2010, where it is helpful to contrast

their performance with the overall survey. The table provides key economic impact insights
for policymakers relating to employment, income generation, innovation, and scheme
attribution. Data come from a compliant survivor subset, but positive and negative
response bias is likely to be controlled by the omission of successful exits and
unsuccessful write-offs and the highly significant (>.05 level) representativeness of the
survey sample (Table 3).
Surveyed managers assessed their ECF funding attribution to subsequent business
development (59%) as proportionally greater than its financial contribution to external
project funding received (49% for the relevant funding round). This suggests that ECF
investment generated at least a 10% net positive catalytic impact on business development
(i.e. jobs, sales, profits, innovation) to date (this could be higher if follow-on funding was
subsequently received from other sources). The lower attribution proportion (46%), but
higher positive net impact (14%), amongst ECF recipients since 2010 reflects newer ECFs'
increase in syndication (spreading investment risk and increasing investor skills) producing
lower proportional ECF funding contribution in seed and early investment rounds post
GFC (Hopp, 2010), resulting in median ECF investment after 2010 of £255,000, with
median additional funding of £550,000 (a 1:2 ratio of newer ECF to other external
funding, compared with the overall scheme ratio of 1:1).
Overall, in terms of both aggregate sales turnover and employment growth since receiving
initial scheme funding, surveyed ECF recipients performed well, with employment almost
doubling (þ85%) and sales turnover approaching trebling (þ170%). For the newer ECF
recipients (post 2010), the relatively lower increase in sales turnover (þ64%), but higher
increase in employment (þ138%) is indicative of their smaller size (average 5 employees at
time of funding) and younger trading age (81% trading less than four years). Almost three
quarters (74%) of new employment has been full-time in both older and newer ECFs with
scheme attribution to new job generation particularly high (83%), representing an average of
8.5 jobs per surveyed business. A key spillover impact was the rapid parallel growth
(þ231%) in contract labour (e.g. IT, technical production, sales and manufacturing jobs)
demonstrating, alongside 26% growth in new part-time employment, the flexible labour
requirements of these businesses to facilitate growth (North et al., 2013). Notably, the
vast majority of contract work was UK-based.
Profitability proved more complex to measure as older ECF recipients were taking longer to
gain market traction than originally planned. ECF fund managers noted that traditional `J' curve
increases in profitability were not yet occurring, with the vast majority of portfolio businesses still
languishing in a deep valley of R&D and early commercialisation pre-profit activities.
The vast majority of surveyed ECF businesses (93%) had increased their level of innovation
since funding, including new and improved products, services, marketing, and processes.
Similarly, 93% experienced management improvements, with 74% improving work practices.
ECF fund managers have introduced improved corporate and financial management and
strengthened portfolio management teams, either through their board presence as NEDs, or
by selective board appointments, notably in sales and marketing. These findings support
assertions that VCs can add value to the performance of their portfolio companies (Baygen
and Freudenberg, 2000; Gompers et al., 2010), with improved corporate management viewed as
crucial to increasing the opportunities for future investments.
Control perspective
A control survey of five `dead deals' were randomly selected from three older ECFs, allowing
sufficient time for performance comparison with funded counterparts. They come from circa
Baldock 1571
15% of applicants reaching interview and negotiation stage, with potentially viable
propositions, which do not convert into fund investments (BIS, 2010). Fall-out
explanations varied: two withdrew, perceiving themselves too early stage; one preferred an
alternative deal; two were rejected based on proposition and due diligence evidence.
Whilst the small control sample is not representative of unassisted potentially viable
applicants, it provides a suitably comparable range of sectors (three IT/telecoms, 1
bio-science, 1 recycling) spanning shorter and longer horizon investments, and regions
(two Northern regions and three Southern regions). It therefore offers useful policy-off
insights when triangulated with other survey evidence. First, four out of five found
alternative private equity funding, suggesting that potential duplication was avoided.
Second, the dead deal firms generally under-performed those assisted, suggesting that the
funds' selection process was working efficiently. One out of five failed, compared with one
out of 10 for assisted ECFs, and another reported that delay in finding alternative funding
resulted in 30% slower development than anticipated. This latter finding is indicative of the
earlier assessment of surveyed-assisted businesses that the timing of ECF funding for viable
business applicants is crucial to their growth. Overall, the four surviving ECF dead deals
achieved aggregate 43% sales turnover and 22% employment increases since their
applications, compared to 177% sales turnover and 69% employment increases amongst
surviving surveyed older ECF portfolio companies.
Triangulating with recipient survey findings, ECFs appear to have selected more viable
cases, or offered more timely smarter finance, rather than duplicated any private investor
activity.
Forecast performance
Business performance forecasts are subjective. Focusing on probably more accurate near-
term one year forecasts substantial aggregate job (þ41%) and sales turnover (þ55%) growth
is anticipated. This is higher amongst newer ECF recipients, suggesting that some will
considerably step up early commercialisation activities, with nine businesses predicting
annual sales turnover increases between £1 m and £8 m, coming from the information
technology, manufacturing and financial services sectors, with two-thirds located in the
London-Oxbridge triangle.
The three-year sales turnover forecast indicates the potential value of recipient businesses
closer to exit. At this stage, they predict annual average sales turnover of £11.6 m (median
£8.6 m). This contrasts to the time of initial ECF funding, when many were pre-trading
(60%) and those with annual sales turnover averaged £1.1 m (median £400,000).
Exit strategies
Ultimately, ECFs' success depends upon exit market conditions, which were reportedly very
tough in the UK during the post GFC period (Baldock, 2015). The UK AIM, providing
smaller cap business progression into public equity, has shown signs of revival with the
notable £120m IPO in Spring 2014 of the Cambridge-based life science company Horizon.
Likewise, stellar trade sales, within the recently depressed UK market rather than to US or
other international corporate buyers, will increase confidence and establish a more buoyant
UK exit market. However, concerns persist that too many UK GVCFs sell their prized
portfolio assets under value, because they cannot afford to follow-on fund and retain
businesses until they achieve optimum exit size, market traction and sustainability
(Baldock and Mason, 2015; Rigos, 2011).
1572 Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 34(8)
Surveyed ECF fund managers put much greater emphasis on planning their investment
exit from the point of initial investment than previously pre GFC, supporting a similar trend
found amongst business angels (North et al., 2013). They broadly accept that ``. . .it is no
longer sufficient to invest in a good business in the expectation that it will sell itself.'' ECF fund
managers, alongside portfolio businesses, now invest more time contacting and networking
with potential trade buyers and VC investors, with seed VCs particularly keen to work with
potential follow-on investors at the full `series A' stage, a point at which they may no longer
wish to be lead investor.
There have been 13 ECF exits (8%). Three recent exits were reported in our survey,18 all
being trade sales at multiples between 2­5Â. Three-fifths of future exits are expected to be
via trade sales, almost one-fifth to private equity takeovers, and under one in 10 by IPO,
suggesting continuing perceptions of weakness in the AIM which attracted closer to 20% of
VC exits in boom times (BIS, 2013). Importantly for the UK economy, just over half of the
managers seeking trade sales expect the business to remain wholly in the UK and a further
third expect core R&D to remain. Furthermore, amongst portfolio managers seeking trade
sales, most will seek managerial roles in existing (50%) or new (36%) UK companies and
those that reinvest (43%) will do so in UK businesses. Overall, this suggests that future
funding and IP spin-out development from ECF exit companies will take place in the UK,
suggesting considerable benefits from Lerner's (2010) global free market GVCF thesis.
Failures
ECFs exhibit proportionally low write-down investment failures (10%), raising concerns
that fund managers are inefficient in culling poorer performing portfolio businesses and
focusing on their star performers. One quarter of older ECF recipients exhibited negative
or zero sales turnover change over a median funding period of five years. This can result in
sub-optimal fund performance (Markowitz, 1952) diverting fund manager time and
investments into ``zombie'' unsustainable companies. Contrastingly, the emerging ECF
seed VC accelerator model appears more ruthlessly efficient, adhering to Lerner's (2010)
private sector-led GVCF vision.
Importantly, the five investment failure case studies demonstrated investment spillover
impacts, including managers finding senior industry roles, the retention and redeployment of
IP and patent activity, and in some cases the seeds of new business opportunities.
Discussion
Whilst general consensus existed amongst demand and supply side informants that ECFs
are addressing the sub-£2 m UK equity gap for young potential high-growth SMEs, with
little sign of duplication or displacement, considerable debate remains as to whether they
have the scale, profile and reach to make significant and lasting impacts on the wider UK
seed and early stage VC ecosystem to deliver their sustainable and private sector led VC
aim.
Supply-side informants (particularly industry trade associations and experts) supported
holistic VC ecosystem perspectives (Hughes, 2009; Hwang and Horowitt, 2012), suggesting
the scheme can make a difference if it forms part of a cohesive government policy addressing
both the support mechanisms developing a pipeline of viable young high-growth potential
businesses through investment readiness programmes, accelerators and mentors (Mason and
Brown, 2013) delivered through the UK government's Business Growth Service (BBB & BIS,
2015) and a suitable finance escalator supply of appropriate financing instruments. The latter
Baldock 1573
point suggests an important role for the British Business Bank (Mazzucato and Penna, 2014;
Van der Schans, 2015) in monitoring and developing more effective design and operation of
the ECFs. A key requirement is raising ECFs' profile (highlighted by fund managers); they
are less known than VCTs, particularly amongst financial intermediaries outside of specialist
VC networks, underlining Lerner's (2010) requirement to develop support services
(accountants, lawyers, fundraisers). All supply-side informants agreed that it is crucial to
develop a suitable exit market, including a functioning IPO public feeder market (Baldock,
2015), because high profile successful exits (lacking during the GFC period) will do most to
encourage increasing earlier stage private VC investment.
Fund managers and stakeholder trade associations noted that ECF design has seen
increased fund size with greater attention now given to planning follow-on funding and
exits. However, they also widely agreed that scheme funds remain too small and require
double the £40m size previously recommended (Rigos, 2011; Technopolis, 2011). Larger
scale would enable the number and range of investments to meet Markowitz's (1952)
optimum of 30 investments, creating a realistic chance of ``backing their most successful
portfolio businesses through to large 100 employee plus high profile £100 m plus trade sales
or IPOs.'' ECF fund managers particularly noted that improved ability to develop scheme
second funds would also assist the VC fund development cycle, enabling sizeable follow-on
funding, addressing a perceived emerging ``series A funding crisis'' and supporting
Cumming's (2011) view of successful VC transition to balanced portfolios across stages,
potentially offering greater attraction to large institutional (e.g. pension fund) investors
that have avoided earlier stage investment post Dotcom (Pierrakis, 2010).
ECFs are designed as feeder demonstrators, to attract high-quality, innovative emerging
fund managers with seed and early stage investment track records, enabling fund scaling-up
and ultimately to spin-out and attraction of more private VC fund managers into the
market, in line with Lerner's (2010) prescribed approach. Thus far, ECFs have supported
early stage VC activity, contributing to the increasing public sector presence in the early
stage UK VC market (Mason and Pierrakis, 2013), but as one private VC mentioned, ``there
is very limited evidence of it spurning independent private VC activity,'' due largely to the
depressed nature of the post GFC UK market. However, signs of change were emerging,
notably in the London market where Passion Capital's ECF model has encouraged angel
capital group and private seed VC activity, assisted by the catalysing effect of increasing seed
stage syndication (Hopp, 2010), allied to the attraction of Enterprise Investment Scheme
(EIS) and Seed EIS investor tax breaks (HMRC, 2014). Here, it was commented by a trade
association that ECFs are ``offering a smart money lead in a rapidly developing market.''
Finally, the future development of the enhanced £400 m ECF scheme was widely
supported, provided this harnesses the enlarged EU state aid limits. As one private VC
noted, ``new Super ECFs could attract substantially more private and institutional
investment,'' better addressing follow-on funding and sustainability issues, also potentially
offering the scale of funding to address the Rowlands gap (2009) in longer horizon intensive
R&D investment which currently extends upwards of £5 m. This was not addressed by other
UK funds as UKIIF was fully invested and the Business Growth Fund was for more
established businesses with annual sales turnover of at least £5 m.
Conclusions
Despite continuing suggestions that GVCFs perform more poorly than their private sector
counterparts, this paper finds that ECFs have evolved and adapted to meet the challenges of
1574 Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 34(8)
changing UK early stage entrepreneurial financing requirements post GFC. Focusing on
assessing scheme impact demonstrates that they are effectively meeting the needs of viable
UK seed and early stage equity gap SMEs. First, they have encouraged and stretch funded
experienced national and international private-led VCs into UK seed and early stage
investment, with little sign of duplication or displacement in addressing the sub-£2 m
funding gap. Second, they have increased in size and scale, adopting innovative strategies
of inter-regional and international investing, increasing syndication and investor
networking, increasing portfolios, spreading risk, and improving planning for follow-on
funding and exits. Third, they have generated economic impact; levering investment,
attributable to direct and indirect job generation, increased sales turnover and innovation,
and improved business management.
However, the ECFs are still a long way from meeting their objective of achieving a
legacy of a sustainable private sector-led early stage UK VC market. The combination of
further increased size `Super ECFs' and second fund developments enabling follow-on
funding and optimal portfolio exits should enhance their profile, notably through
successful exits, and encourage increased earlier stage investment from institutional,
corporate and private VCs, including ECF fund manager spin-outs. The British Business
Bank will have a crucial role in overseeing this process and developing a more cohesive
entrepreneurial financing ecosystem.
Our study has single scheme, cross-sectional limitations, undertaken during scheme mid-
term at a time when the GFC had severely disrupted fund performance. A clearer view will
emerge over the next three years as early pathfinder ECFs complete their maximum 12-year
cycle. However, this paper establishes a robust framework for future scaled-up and
longitudinal research, including the potential for international GVCF comparator studies.

Appendix 1. BVCA definitions for stages of investment
Seed: Financing that allows a business concept to be developed (e.g. production of a business
plan, prototypes and additional research) prior to bringing a product to market and
commencing large-scale manufacturing.
Start-up: Financing for use in product development and initial marketing. Companies

Other early stage: Financing to companies that have completed the product development
stage and require further funds to initiate commercial manufacturing and sales. They may
not yet be generating profits.
Late stage venture: Financing to companies that have reached a fairly stable growth
rate; that is, not growing as fast as the rates attained in the early stage. These companies
may or may not be profitable, but are more likely to be than in previous stages of
development.
Expansion: Sometimes known as `development' or `growth' capital, provided for the
growth and expansion of an operating company which is trading profitably. Capital may
be used to finance increased production capacity, market or product development, and/or to
provide additional working capital.
Replacement capital: Minority stake purchase from another private equity investment
organisation or from another shareholder or shareholders.
Management buyout (MBO): Funds provided to enable current operating management
and investors to acquire an existing product line or business, including Institutional buyouts
(IBOs) and leveraged buyouts (LBOs).
Management buy-in (MBI): Funds provided to enable an external manager or group of
managers to buy into a company.
Other Late stage, including: Bridge financing: Financing made available to a company in
the period of transition from being privately owned to being publicly quoted. PIPE: Private
investment in public companies (minority stake only). Rescue/Turnaround: Financing made
available to existing businesses which have experienced trading difficulties, with a view to
re-establishing prosperity. Public to private: Purchase of quoted shares with the purpose of
de-listing the company. Secondary buyout: Purchase of a company from another private
equity investment organisation.
