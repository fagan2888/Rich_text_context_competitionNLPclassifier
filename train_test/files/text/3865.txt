Introduction
In Malaysia, the school population has become increasingly
diverse, and includes students from a range of different cul-
tures, languages, and socioeconomic backgrounds. This
diversity challenges the schools to create environments that
are sensitive to the myriad backgrounds. One of the issues
that challenges the schools is student delinquency. Student
delinquency is one of the most prevailing problems affecting
school discipline not only in Malaysia but also around the
world (Arum & Ford, 2012). These students dare to break the
rules without feeling guilty or fear of punishment. In fact,
they know the consequences they are going to face--warn-
ing or suspension. Thus, delinquency in school will result in
eventually dropping out of school, which will then lead to
various societal problems, such as drug addiction, criminal-
ity, and rape (Moffitt, 1993).
Like many other countries, schools in Malaysia practice
the disciplinary policies of zero tolerance and punitive mea-
sures. Although traditional punishment and exclusion may
seem to work as an instant solution, it provides a short-lived
reprieve from disciplinary problems. According to Graves
and Mirsky (2007), such policies actually hinder academic
achievement and increase both disciplinary problems and
drop-out rates. Furthermore, research has shown that in the
long term, punishment and exclusion are ineffective and can
lead to renewed incidents of disruption and escalation of
behavior (Mayer, Caruso, & Salovey, 2000).
It was reported that in 2011, a total of 111,484 students in
Selangor were involved in disciplinary cases of which 72,557
were students from secondary schools and 38,927 were from
primary schools. Of the cases recorded, 17,595 involved
crime, 19,545 truancy, 3,031 pornography, 5,212 vandalism,
and 8,563 other disciplinary problems. In 2012, a total of
108,650 cases were recorded (Ministry of Education: Daily
Management Division). These are huge numbers, and within
these large numbers lie the potential dropouts and those who

Abstract
This study examined the relationships between emotional intelligence (EI) and the delinquent behavior (DB) of the students.
The level of DB reported by the students is categorized under the headings of crime, drugs, vandalism, pornography and
sexual behavior, other misbehavior, and dishonesty. Meanwhile, EI is investigated by looking at the level of EI domains, such as
self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, social skills, maturity, and spiritual awareness. Data were gathered
from a sample of 300 secondary school students aged 15 to 18 years in Selangor. The schools they attended were selected
from the so-called "hardcore schools," which were identified by Schools Division in the State of Selangor. Two instruments,
namely, surveys on the "Behavior of Students" and "Malaysian Emotional Quotient Inventory (R)­Adolescence (MEQI),"
were utilized to collect the research data and were analyzed using SPSS 19.0. The data showed that the highest delinquency
among the adolescents was misbehavior in school, followed by crime, vandalism, pornography, dishonesty, and drugs. Results
also revealed a negative linear relationship between EI (r = -.208, n = 300, p = .001) and DB, implying that adolescents with
better EI had lower levels of delinquency. Multiple regression analysis revealed that EI is a significant predictor of DB and self-
awareness is the main factor of DB. This study contributes to the knowledge of the importance of EI in understanding DB.
EI can be used to identify and discriminate emotional skills among those adolescents who exhibit DB. Addressing the role of
EI as a predictor would probably prove to be effective in reducing DB.

may fit the criteria of being suspended or expelled from
schools.
Delinquent Behavior (DB)
In this study, DB refers to the delinquency in school as crime,
taking or selling drugs, pornography and sexual behavior,
dishonesty, truancy, and any misbehavior that is against
schools' rules. In the context of this study, these inappropri-
ate behaviors occur in school and it is believed that the early
stage of DB has the potential to cause school failure, impair-
ment in socioemotional development, peer rejection, delin-
quency, and adult crime (Moffitt, 1993).According to Loeber
and Farrington (2000), the early onset of delinquency signifi-
cantly increases the risk of serious crime and violence in
later years.
School "crime," in this study, refers to the use of drugs,
and the presence of weapons; "vandalism" includes behav-
ior, such as breaking windows, slashing the tires of the teach-
ers' cars, spray painting on the school walls with graffiti, and
destroying the property of the school; "dishonesty" is cheat-
ing, such as in examinations, lying, and other forms of dis-
honest behavior; "pornography" for secondary school
students includes watching pornographic videos and engag-
ing in sexual behavior, such as molesting, kissing, and sex;
and "misbehavior" refers to any behavior that disrupts the
teaching and learning activities, truancy, making commotion
in public, or teasing their school friends.
Sprinthall and Collins (1995) also mentioned two broad
dimensions of behavior disorders--internalizing and exter-
nalizing behavior. Internalizing behavior is directed inward
and involves behavioral deficits, such as isolation, with-
drawal, and depression, whereas externalizing behavior is
directed outwards and takes the form of disturbing others,
verbal and physical aggression, and acts of violence.
As such, delinquency is considered as an externalizing
problem because it presents "acting out" behavior, whereas
emotional difficulties are regarded as internalizing, because
problems are turned inward. Problems, such as depression,
suicide, stress, and eating disorders are examples of internal-
izing reactions that will increase during adolescence. These
prompt researchers to find a solution to meet the social and
emotional needs of all students, particularly the emotional
intelligence (EI) of those delinquent students.
Emotional Intelligence (EI)
EI involves the capacity to carry out acceptable emotional
behavior and enhancement of reasoning. More specifically,
EI involves the ability to perceive and accurately express
emotion, to use emotion to facilitate thought, to understand
emotions, and to manage emotions for emotional growth
(Mayer & Salovey, 1997). According to Mayer, DiPaolo, and
Salovey (1990), EI was described as a type of emotional
information processing that includes the accurate appraisal
of emotions in oneself and others, appropriate expression of
emotions, and adaptive regulation of emotions. While
Weisinger (1998) defined EI as the intelligent use of emo-
tion, he suggested that EI also enables individuals to obtain
positive results in utilizing their emotions to regulate their
behavior. In fact, EI is not a trait, but can be nurtured, devel-
oped, and augmented.
Similarly, Goleman (1998a) and Mayer and Salovey
(1997) described EI as an influential concept that impacts
on the education of students in school. This ability allows
one to discriminate among one's emotions to best guide
one's behavior. According to Goleman (1997b), many stu-
dents who faced emotional challenges manifest unmanage-
able behavior and are more vulnerable to school discipline
problems.
EI and DB
Several studies have found that EI could have a significant
impact on one's life. It was found that higher EI was a predic-
tor of life satisfaction. In addition, people who are high in EI
are also more likely to use an adaptive defense style against
deviant behavior and thus exhibit healthier psychological
adaptation ( Mayer et. al, 2000). Performance measures of EI
have illustrated that higher levels of EI are associated with
increased positive interactions with friends and family.
Negative relationships have likewise been identified between
EI and problem behavior. Mayer et al. (2000) found that
lower EI was associated with lower self-reports of violent
and trouble-prone behavior among college students, a corre-
lation that remained significant even when the effects of
intelligence and empathy were partialed out. According to
Mayer, et al. (2000), lower EI (as measured by the Mayer­
Salovey­Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test ["MSCEIT"])
has been significantly associated with higher use of illegal
drugs and alcohol, as well as increased participation in devi-
ant behavior (e.g., involvement in physical fights and
vandalism).
Erasmus (2007), indicated that young people who are
lacking in social and emotional competence might end up
becoming self-centered and unable to empathize and relate to
others. Moreover, students with DB often struggle with dif-
ficult personal and emotional problems. Psychological fac-
tors could be an important factor to provide protection
against delinquent and violent behavior patterns, such as the
ability to be flexible during periods of change in school or
work schedule, having effective and efficient communica-
tion skills, the ability to use humor in deescalating negative
situations, and the use of a wide range of social skills
(Benard, 1995; Dobbin & Gatowski, 1996).
A longitudinal study conducted by Fortin (2003) showed
that delinquent students lack self-control. This causes them
to react negatively to criticism and renders them unable to
accept the opinion of others. In addition, being unable to
control their emotions and moods will lead them into con-
flicts with other students and adults. In fact, a child's emo-
tional life has an impact on his or her behavior.
Maria Chong et al. 3
In Malaysia, Liau, Liau, Teoh, and Liau (2003), in their
research on EI, found that higher levels of EI were hypothe-
sized to be associated with lower levels of internalizing prob-
lem behavior, such as academic anxiety, depression, somatic
complaints, and stress, as well as lower levels of externaliz-
ing problem behavior, such as aggression and delinquency.
In this study, EI focused on personal and social compe-
tencies. EI consists of seven domains: self-awareness, self-
regulation, self-motivation, empathy, social skills, maturity,
and spiritual. Those were the independent variables used to
hypothesize the predictors of DB.
Research Questions
Research Question 1: What is the level of DB reported
by students in respect of (a) crime, (b) drugs, (c) vandal-
ism, (d) pornography and sexual behavior, (e) other mis-
behavior, and (f) dishonesty?
Research Question 2: What is the level of EI among the
students with DB in secondary schools?
Research Question 3: Is there any statistically significant
difference in EI with regard to gender?
Research Question 4: Is there any statistically significant
relationship between EI and DB among students in sec-
ondary schools?
Research Question 5: Does EI predict the level of DB
among students in secondary schools?
Method
Sample
The participants in the study were 300 secondary school stu-
dents (200 boys, 100 girls; 178 Malays, 84 Chinese, 40
Indians) aged 15 to 18 years from 10 schools in Selangor.
These schools were selected because they were listed as
"hardcore schools" in relation to discipline problems
obtained from the Schools Division in the State of Selangor.
The respondents were identified with the help of teachers
and counselors based on their DB represented in their
school's demerit systems.
Procedure
The researcher first obtained written permission from the
Educational Planning and Research Department (EPRD) of
the Ministry of Education, Malaysia, for the study. Later, the
researcher sought written permission from the State
Education Department to carry out the research in the school.
With the permission from the authorities concerned, the
researcher then approached the administrator of the schools
to coordinate the data collection. Before the data collection,
the researcher approached the school to get permission from
the school to set the time and date to conduct the survey. The
researcher, with the cooperation of the disciplinary teacher
and counselor, identified the students through the merit and
demerit system of the respective schools. From each school,
30 Form 4 students were selected randomly for this research.
The selected students were of various races and both gen-
ders. The researcher arranged to come on the day that had
been fixed for the survey. The survey took 2 days in each of
the schools.
Instrumentation
Two instruments, namely, surveys on the "Behavior of
Students," and "Malaysian Emotional Quotient Inventory
(R)­Adolescence (MEQI)" were utilized to collect the
research data and were analyzed using SPSS 19.0.
"Behavior of students."This instrument was designed by
Rozumah et al. (2003). Permission to use the instrument was
obtained from the author for this study. Rozumah et al.
(2003) had reported a reliability of .92 confirming that this
instrument has high reliability and is suitable for assessing
the behavior of secondary school students. Meanwhile, the
reliability of this instrument in the current study was .73.
This instrument comprises 35 items with six subscales to
identify the delinquent acts of the respondents. The six sub-
scales of this instrument are the DBs of students categorized
as crime, vandalism, drugs, pornography and sexual behav-
ior, dishonesty, and other misbehavior. It was used to assess
the involvement of students in DB over the 8 months imme-
diately prior to when the questionnaires were administered.
These 35 items are scored based on a 5-point Likert-type
scale, namely, 1 = not very frequent, 2 = not frequent, 3 =
moderately frequent, 4 = frequent, and 5 = very frequent. The
lowest score is 35 while the highest is 175. The higher the
score in each category, the more frequently the particular
delinquent act is committed. Answers to the items cover the
following offenses: stealing something worth RM50.00 or
less, stealing something worth RM50.00 or more, shoplift-
ing, buying stolen goods, selling drugs, and discipline prob-
lems in school, such as fighting, vandalism, throwing items,
verbal bullying, graffiti in school, or threatening or using
violence in the classroom.
MEQI.MEQI was developed by Noriah Mohd Ishak et al.
(2000) to assess the EI of adolescents based on the Goleman
(1998) model of EI. The instrument has 183 items and mea-
sures the seven domains of EI. The seven domains are (a)
self-awareness, (b) self-regulation, (c) self-motivation, (d)
empathy, (e) social skills, (f) spiritual, and (g) maturity.
MEQI-Adolescence uses a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). MEQI-Ado-
lescence consists of 11 sections: Section A to Section K. The
items measure the performance of the respondents to per-
ceive, facilitate, manage, and understand their emotions
based on the seven domains. These items assess respondents'
EI ability in terms of self-awareness (35 items), self-regula-
tion (40 items), self-motivation (36 items), empathy (45
items), social skills (52 items), spirituality (9 items), and
4 SAGE Open
maturity (6 items). Meanwhile, the Cronbach's values for the
instruments are between .80 and .97. These values confirmed
that this instrument is reliable and suitable for secondary
school students in Malaysia. Examples of the items are, "I
can be moved by an extraordinary event"; "I know when I
have negative thoughts about myself"; "I can execute what I
have planned"; "I am aware that anger is bad for my health."
Results
Research Question 1: What is the level of DB reported
by students in respect of (a) crime, (b) drugs, (c) vandal-
ism, (d) pornography and sexual behavior, (e) other mis-
behavior, and (f) dishonesty?
Table 1 shows the overall analysis of the levels for the six
DBs--crime, drugs, vandalism, pornography and sexual
behavior, other misbehavior, and dishonesty.
Research Question 2: What is the level of EI among the
students with DB in secondary schools?
This section is to answer level of EI among students with
DB. Table 2 shows the mean score of the seven
domains--self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation,
empathy, social skills, spirituality, and maturity.
Based on Table 2, among the seven EI domains, self-
awareness (M = 59.39, SD = 16.24) was the lowest. Followed
by self-regulation (M = 67.86, SD = 9.73), maturity (M =
68.25, SD = 13.24), social skills (M = 68.51, SD = 11.29),
self-motivation (M = 70.28, SD = 13.72), spiritual (M =
70.45, SD = 13.71), empathy (M = 70.52, SD = 9.53). The
empathy domain was the highest among the seven EI domains.
Research Question 3: Is there a statistically significant
difference in EI with regard to gender?
An independent-samples t test was then conducted to com-
pare the mean EI score for male and female delinquent stu-
dents. There was no statistically significant difference in the
mean EI score for male (M = 66.65, SD = 10.08) and female
delinquent students, M = 68.84, SD = 9.69; t(298) = -1.796,
p = .074. An inspection of the two means suggests that male
and female delinquent students were not significantly differ-
ent in their EI.
Research Question 4: Is there a statistically significant
relationship between EI and DB among students in sec-
ondary schools?
To determine the relationship between EI and DB, Pearson
product­moment correlation coefficient was used to deter-
mine the significance of the correlation between EI and DB.
The findings, as depicted in Table 3, show there was a
statistically significant negative correlation between EI and
DB (r = -.208, n = 300, p = .001). The negative correlation
coefficient of .208 indicates that as the score of EI increases,
the delinquency will decrease considerably. Table 4 showed
a correlation between EI domains and DB.
The correlation between EI domains and DB was investi-
gated using the Pearson product­moment correlation coeffi-
cient. There were seven domains: self-awareness,
self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, maturity, and spir-
ituality. As shown in Table 4, there was a statistically signifi-
cant negative relationship between self-awareness and DB
(r = -.158, n = 300, p < .05). The negative correlation coef-
ficient indicates that as the score of self-awareness increases,
the delinquency decreases considerably.

Among the six categories of delinquency, it was found that "other
misbehavior" was the highest (M = 2.24, SD = .61) compared with other
categories. "Crime" (M = 1.95, SD = .56) ranked second and "vandalism"
(M = 1.77, SD = .06) ranked third. This was followed by "pornography
and sexual behavior" (M = 1.63, SD = .63) and "dishonesty" (M = 1.45,
SD = .43). The last category was "drugs" (M = 1.17, SD = .54).

However, there was a statistically significant negative
correlation between self-motivation and DB (r = -.136, n =
300, p < .05). The negative correlation coefficient indicates
that as the score of self-motivation increases, the delinquency
decreases considerably.
Finally, there was a significant negative correlation
between spirituality (r = -.132, n = 300, p < .05) and DB,
whereby the negative correlation coefficient indicates that as
the score of spirituality increases, the delinquency decreases
considerably.
Hence, the findings show that (a) there was a significant
negative relationship between the overall EI and DB; higher EI
will decrease the DB and (b) there were also significant nega-
tive relationships between self-awareness, self-motivation, and
spirituality and DB.
Research Question 5: Does EI predict the level of DB
among students in secondary schools?
Table 5 displays the answer to the research question. A step-
wise multiple linear regressions was conducted to determine
the predictors (self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motiva-
tion, empathy, social skills, maturity, and spirituality) of DB
among the respondents.
The results reported that only one of the EI domains, that
is, self-awareness, predicted DB. Table 5 shows that 3.0%
(r = .16) of the variants in the criterion variable were
explained by the predictor variable, that is, self-awareness.
The results from the ANOVA analysis in the regression
model are presented in Table 6. The results show that self-
awareness was a statistically significant predictor variable of
DB, F(1, 291) = 6.12, p < .05.
The data in Table 7 indicate that the self-awareness ( =
-.16, p < .05) was a statistically significant factor of DB. The
self-awareness contributed 3.0% (r = .16) on DB, F(1, 291) =
6.12, p < .05. The other EI domains do not contribute
to DB.
Discussion
Table 1 shows that the majority of the respondents were
involved in the category of "other misbehavior" (M = 2.24,
SD = .61).Among such misbehavior, most of the respondents
played truant because of working part-time to earn extra
money. In addition, they also skipped class for no reason.
These types of misbehavior were very common among the
students and in line with the study by Shamsul Azhar Shah et
al. (2012), who reported that truancy happened in every
school. Students who stated that they often skipped classes
would be engaged in at least one form of delinquency-related
behavior.
In this study, crime acts (M = 1.95, SD = .56), such as
bringing weapons to school, assaulting other students, and
involvement in gangsterism and fighting, were frequently
committed by the students. This is followed by vandalism
(M = 1.77, SD = .06), referring to damaging and destroying
somebody else's property on purpose, and pornography and
sexual behavior (M = 1.63, SD = .63) in which most students
were involved with pornographic materials. In addition, stu-
dents frequently committed dishonesty (M = 1.45, SD = .43)

whereby they refused to pay for movie, bus, or commuter
tickets. The last category is drugs (M = 1.17, SD = .54)
whereby taking drugs is more frequent than selling drugs.
Although only 3 (1%) students were frequently involved in
selling drugs, this result shows a very alarming situation that
could eventually lead to serious social criminal behavior.
The researcher concluded that the level of delinquency of the
students is mild. This could be attributed to the fact that the
sample did not include students or youth engaging in serious
DB. Most of the delinquent students just misbehave in the
school, such as truancy, and are not involved in serious
offenses.
This result is also consistent with the findings of Norlizah
Che Hassan (2008) concerning adolescent delinquency in
that the level of the adolescents' DB did not achieve 10%.
According to Norlizah (2008), 98.9% of the adolescents'
delinquency is at a low level with only 1.1% adolescents at
the high level. This implies that the level of delinquency in
Malaysian schools is controllable. Moreover, in the study on
violence among adolescents, Lee, Chen, Lee, and Kaur
(2007) found that 10.7% had been involved in a physical
fight with other people, theft (4.3%), vandalism (2.7%), and
had carried a weapon (2.4%). Although all these types of
behavior in the school are still controllable, with only a small
percentage involved in delinquency, it is still alarming as
these could lead to more serious forms of delinquency and
social ills.
The findings of EI are consistent with Mayer et al. (2000)
who found a negative relationship between EI and problem
behavior. A lower EI was associated with lower self-reports
of violent and trouble-prone behavior among adolescents, a
correlation which remained significant even when the effects
of intelligence and empathy were partialed out. Lower EI (as
measured by the MSCEIT) has been significantly associated
with the higher use of illegal drugs and alcohol, as well as
increased participation in deviant behavior (i.e., involvement
in physical fights and vandalism).
Self-awareness was found to have a significant relation-
ship with DB. The result shows the delinquent students paid
less attention to emotions or feelings. This lack of emotional
awareness means that delinquent students are unable to con-
nect their feelings with their thoughts (Goleman, 1998) and
their feelings, such as anger or frustration. Therefore, if the
students are aware of their emotional states, and their
strengths and weaknesses, they will become aware of their
values and goals in their life. Self-awareness will make them
mindful that they have to accept criticism and feedback
regardless of whatsoever happens.
Based on the findings in Table 4, motivation was found to
have a statistically significant relationship with DB.
Motivation is an emotional tendency that guides or facilitates
toward goal achievements. Under the motivation domain, are
three motivational subdomains such as achievement drive,
commitment, initiative and optimism. Students who have
self-motivation would strive to excel in their undertakings
and have high self-esteem. Delinquent students lack the
motivation to learn and have limited ability to focus and
maintain a positive sense of self-worth while being con-
fronted by daily school challenges (Lopes, Salovey, & Straus,
2003). They do not have the determination to achieve a goal
and to excel in their work.
Spiritual awareness was found to have a statistically sig-
nificant relationship with DB. One of the elements in the
social control theory is belief. According to the theory of
Hirschi (1977), if a person has strong beliefs in society's
norms, then the individual would avoid delinquency or crim-
inal behavior. Those people who are deeply engaged in reli-
gion would be less likely to be involved in crime and
deviance. However, a study by Mapp (2009) concerning the
role of religiosity and spirituality in juvenile delinquency
reported a negative and statistically significant relationship
between religion and spiritual, and marijuana use. Hence,
this study supports the study by other researchers.
The result in Table 7 shows self-awareness is one of the EI
constructs that predicts DB. The inability to understand emo-
tions in oneself and others, including understanding how
emotions can be changed and how people react to different
emotions, would contribute to delinquency. According to
Liau et al. (2003), in their research on EI, higher levels of EI
were hypothesized to be associated with lower levels of
internalizing problematic behavior, such as academic anxi-
ety, depression, somatic complaints, and stress, as well as
lower levels of externalizing problem behavior, such as
aggression and delinquency.
Based on the results, the relationship between DB and the
set of predictor variables can be characterized as relatively
weak. Total contribution by the combined set of predictors:
EI accounted for 3% of the variance of DB. Eron, Gentry
and Schlegel (1994) argued that no single factor explains
much of the variance in delinquency but that it is the combi-
nation of the identified risk factors that makes the differ-
ence. In addition, psychological factors, such as EI could be
an important factor to provide protection against delinquent
and violent behavior patterns including regulation of their
emotions and awareness of their own strengths and
weaknesses.
Conclusion
After the discussion on each variable, this study has docu-
mented considerable knowledge for all walks of society in
understanding DB. Deficiency in EI is considered to be
impaired in emotional and social functioning. Goleman
(1995) also agreed that social skills and managing emotions
are related to coping strategies and that deficiencies in those
skills are related to the involvement in risk-taking behaviors.
To gain success at school, students should have confidence,
intentionality, self-control, capacity to communicate, and the
ability to cooperate. These skills are very important to hinder
any problematic behavior.

EI can be used to identify and discriminate emotional
skills among those adolescents who exhibit DB. In this study,
the deficiencies of certain EI domains of the delinquent stu-
dents are highlighted. These are emotional awareness, accu-
rate awareness, self-confidence from the self-awareness
domain; trustworthiness from the self-regulation domain,
and influence and conflict from the social skills domains. As
such, these delinquent students need to be guided and given
the opportunities to build up those competencies. This study
has documented a complete profile of EI on delinquent
students.
The study also provides a realization that delinquent ado-
lescents do have their own strengths whereby their EI domain
of empathy is higher (Table 2). They are motivated, innova-
tive, and have the tendency to initiate or manage a change of
situation. Sadly, we often label them and only see their weak-
nesses. Opportunities should be given to these adolescents to
show their potential and personal abilities as these delinquent
adolescents can happen to be future leaders who can make
changes in a group or organization. Furthermore, emotional
knowledge can be improved through education practices;
perhaps training children and adults in EI can lead to more
adaptive behavior.
