Abstract--Recent guidelines recommending more aggressive blood pressure control in patients with chronic kidney disease
have unknown impact. We assessed trends in and predictors of blood pressure control in 8829 adult National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2006 participants with hypertension (self-report, measured blood pressure, or use
of antihypertensive medications), without (n7178) and with (n1651) chronic kidney disease. Uncontrolled blood
pressure was defined as follows: general definition, systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure
90 mm Hg, and disease-specific definition, systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure
85 mm Hg (1999­2002) and systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 80 mm Hg
(2003­2006) for those with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate: 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) or
diabetes mellitus (self-report). Proportions with uncontrolled blood pressure in 1999­2006 were greater in those with
chronic kidney disease versus those without chronic kidney disease (51.5% versus 48.7% [general definition: P0.122]
and 68.8% versus 51.7% [disease-specific definition: P0.001]). In those with chronic kidney disease, there were
significant decreases in uncontrolled blood pressure over time (55.9% to 47.8% [general definition: P0.011]). With
adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables, older age (P0.001) and lack of antihypertensive
treatment (P0.001) were associated with uncontrolled blood pressure, regardless of chronic kidney disease status;
nonwhite race (P0.002) was associated in those without chronic kidney disease, whereas female sex (P0.030) was
associated in those with chronic kidney disease. Multiple medications (P0.001) and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (P0.001) were associated with less uncontrolled blood pressure. Although
some improvement has occurred over time, uncontrolled blood pressure remains highly prevalent, especially in subjects
with chronic kidney disease and in nonwhites, older persons, and women. Therapy appears suboptimal. (Hypertension.

 chronic kidney disease
Published guidelines for blood pressure (BP) control in-
clude lower BP targets among those with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) or diabetes mellitus1,2 compared with those
without these conditions. Lower BP is generally well known
to be associated with decreased risk of kidney disease
progression, cardiovascular events, and death.3,4 Despite the
recognized importance of controlling BP, control in the
general population has been shown previously to be fairly
poor, ranging from 29% to 60%, depending on age, sex, and
race.5­7 Similarly, patients with CKD have also been shown
to have low rates of BP control.6,8­10 It has been shown that
BP control increased from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004,11 but
whether BP control has improved over recent years is unclear.
Moreover, factors that predict uncontrolled BP, including
guideline-concordant care, are not well known in the setting
of CKD.
Previous studies of BP control in persons with CKD were
generally performed within subpopulations or in a less
representative cohort or screening studies. Using data from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) from 1999 to 2006, we examined not only the
extent of uncontrolled BP in the adult US non-CKD and CKD

populations but also whether uncontrolled BP improved over
this period. We also compared the estimates obtained using
both general and (more stringent) disease-specific guidelines
for defining BP control. In addition, we examined and
compared potential treatment and risk factors for uncon-
trolled BP by CKD status.
Methods
Study Design
The NHANESs are currently conducted every 2 years by the
National Center for Health Statistics to examine disease prevalence
and trends over time in representative samples of noninstitutional-
ized US civilian residents.12 The survey consists of a standardized
in-home interview and a physical examination and blood and urine
collection at a mobile examination center (MEC), for which partic-
ipants give informed consent. The protocol was approved by an
institutional review board.
We examined combined data from the 1999­2000,13 2001­
2002,14 2003­2004,15 and 2005­200616 NHANESs. Our study was
limited to 8829 NHANES participants from 1999 to 2006 who were
20 years old, underwent a MEC examination, and had hyperten-
sion. Those participants without measured BP or with missing age,
sex, race, or creatinine were excluded.
Measurements
A standardized protocol17 for measurements of auscultatory BPs was
executed during the MEC visit by a trained physician with a mercury
sphygmomanometer using appropriate cuff sizes. Recorded systolic
BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) are the means of 3 measurements
separated by 30 seconds after a 5-minute rest period. Averages of 3
(sometimes 4) recordings were used; individual pulse pressures were
calculated for each recording and averaged.
Self-reported information on demographics (age, sex, and race),
socioeconomic status (education, insurance, and income), health
conditions (hypertension and diabetes mellitus), health behaviors
(smoking and obesity), and routine site of health care were obtained
during the interview portions of the surveys. In addition, prescription
medication information was obtained during the interview, with the
interviewer recording the names of medications from the bottles
provided by the participant. Height and weight were measured
during the MEC examination. Random spot urine samples were
obtained, and urine albumin and creatinine were measured using
frozen specimens. Urine albumin was measured using solid-phase
fluorescence immunoassay; urine creatinine was measured using the
modified Jaffe kinetic method in the same laboratory. Serum
creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic method of Jaffe
using different analyzers in different survey years.
Definitions
Uncontrolled BP was defined in those with hypertension 2 ways, per
Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) guidelines. By the general
definition, BP was considered uncontrolled if SBP was
140 mm Hg or DBP was 90 mm Hg. By the disease-specific
definition, BP was considered uncontrolled in those with CKD or
diabetes mellitus if SBP was 130 mm Hg or DBP was 85
(1999­2002) or 80 (2003­2006) mm Hg, according to the JNC-
VI2 and JNC-VII1 criteria, respectively, or, in those without these
conditions, if SBP was 140 mm Hg or DBP was 90 mm Hg.
Hypertension was defined by self-reported hypertension, high
measured BP, or use of antihypertensive medications. Self-reported
hypertension was defined by an answer of "yes" to the question,
"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional
that you have hypertension, also called high blood pressure?" SBP
140 mm Hg or DBP 90 mm Hg was considered high measured
BP. The use of hypertension medications was defined as any
prescription for diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors, - and/or -blockers, calcium channel blockers, angio-
tensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), central -2 agonists, aldosterone
receptor blockers, or direct vasodilators, prescribed either alone or in
combination.
CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate 15 and
60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (stage 3 or 4 CKD according to the Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines18). CKD was limited
to stages 3 and 4 to avoid potential misclassification because of
short-term variability in microalbuminuria in stages 1 and 2.19
Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated according to the
modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation
for calibrated creatinine: estimated glomerular filtration rate175
[(calibrated serum creatinine in milligrams per deciliter)1.154]
age0.203(0.742 if female)(1.210 if black).20,21 Serum creatinine
was calibrated for adherence to the Cleveland Clinic protocol for the
1999­2000 and 2005­2006 surveys using regression formulas pro-
vided by NHANES; no correction was required for the 2001­2002 or
2003­2004 surveys.22 Diabetes mellitus was defined by an answer of
"yes" to the question, "Have you ever been told by a doctor or other
health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?"
Albuminuria was considered to be present at urinary albumin:creat-
inine ratios of 30 to 299 mg/g (microalbuminuria) and 300 mg/g
(macroalbuminuria).
Statistical Methods
The proportion with uncontrolled BP was calculated by the general
and disease-specific definitions and by CKD status. Variance of
proportions was estimated with Taylor series linearization. The
proportion with uncontrolled BP was also calculated by patient
characteristics and by survey year. These characteristics were exam-
ined in logistic models predicting uncontrolled BP, with adjustment
for possible confounders, including demographics, socioeconomic
status, diabetes mellitus, obesity, treatment with hypertension med-
ications, and survey years (before and after JNC-VII guidelines).
Odds ratios and adjusted percentages were obtained from these
models; only adjusted percentages are shown, because the odds
ratios are likely to overestimate the relative risk in the setting of a
condition as common as uncontrolled BP.
All of the analyses were performed using the svy commands in
Stata 10.0 (Stata Corp) to account for study design weights, strata,
and pseudostrata. Appropriate NHANES 8-year MEC weights were
used; 8-year weights were calculated as follows: 8-year weight1/
24-year weight (if survey year was 1999­2002) and 8-year
weight1/22-year weight (if survey year was 2003­2006).23
Results
Participant Characteristics by CKD
Participants with hypertension who had CKD had higher SBP
and lower DBP than those without CKD (Table 1). Those
with CKD were also significantly older; more likely to be
female or white, to have a lower income, to have diabetes
mellitus and albuminuria, and to be treated with antihyper-
tensive medications; and less likely to have a high school
education and to be obese. Those with CKD were also more
likely to be on multiple medications and to be on ACE
inhibitors/ARBs or diuretics than those without CKD. The
proportions on ACE inhibitors/ARBs increased from 1999­
2002 to 2003­2006 (13.8% to 18.8%; P0.001), whereas the
proportion on other medications declined (3.6% to 2.2%;
P0.001). Among those on treatment in 1999­2006, a lower
proportion of those with CKD (36.5%) were treated with
ACE inhibitors/ARBs compared with those without CKD
(40.9%; P0.035), but those with CKD were more likely to
be on multiple antihypertensive medications (37.9% versus
27.3%; P0.001).

Uncontrolled BP, SBP, and DBP by CKD Status
Without adjustment, uncontrolled BP was greater in those
with versus without CKD by the general and disease-specific
definitions (Figure 1). These differences remained after
adjustment for demographics, socioeconomic status, and
clinical variables (Table 2; P0.001 for no CKD versus CKD
by either definition). In a sensitivity analysis, with hyperten-
sion defined only by self-report and measured BP, the
proportions with uncontrolled BP were similar, 51.2% and
54.1% for those without CKD and 55.4% and 72.1% for those
with CKD, by the general and disease-specific definitions.
Among the entire population (including those without hyper-
tension), the proportions with BP exceeding the general and
disease-specific guidelines were 16.1% and 17.6% (without
CKD) and 39.8% and 60.6% (with CKD).
The vast majority of uncontrolled BP could be attributed to
high SBP (87.0% general definition; 94.2% disease-specific
definition) rather than high DBP, regardless of CKD status.
The distributions of age-adjusted BP among those with CKD
were more right skewed (Figure 2A and 2B), indicating that
these participants are more likely to have extremely high BPs
than those without CKD. The proportions of participants with
CKD who had BPs above the thresholds were higher for SBP
and lower for DBP, relative to those without CKD.
Trends in Uncontrolled BP
For those without CKD, prevalence of uncontrolled BP by
both definitions decreased between 1999­2002 and 2003­
2006 (Figure 3); similar decreases were seen for those with
CKD, although the trend did not reach statistical significance
by the disease-specific definition. With adjustment, results
were similar (Table 2). Significant decreasing trends were
also seen for proportions with stage II uncontrolled BP
(P0.002 and 0.037 for no CKD and CKD, respectively).
Predictors of Uncontrolled BP
Demographics
After adjustment, participants who did not have CKD and
who were older and of non-Hispanic black race were signif-
icantly more likely than their younger and white counterparts
to have uncontrolled BP by the general definition (Table 2).
There was no difference by sex in those without CKD,
regardless of adjustment. For those with CKD, older age and
female sex were both associated with higher rates of uncon-
trolled BPs by the same definition, with or without adjust-
ment, whereas uncontrolled BP did not differ by race in those
with CKD, using the general definition. Interaction analyses
showed that, after adjustment, sex remained a possible effect
modifier of risk of uncontrolled BP by CKD status (P0.045
and 0.061, general and disease-specific definitions, respec-
tively). Regardless of CKD status, participants who were
70 years of age had proportions of uncontrolled BP that
were 2-fold those in participants aged 20 to 39 by this
definition.

Socioeconomic Factors
Participants without CKD who had lower education and
lower income were significantly more likely than their
counterparts to have uncontrolled BP by either definition
(Table 2); however, neither factor remained significantly
associated after adjustment. For those with CKD, there were
no statistically significant socioeconomic predictors of un-
controlled BP.
Clinical Factors
Participants without CKD who were not obese and had
diabetes mellitus were both significantly more likely than
their counterparts to have uncontrolled BP by the general
definition (Table 2); only diabetes mellitus status remained
associated after adjustment and showed evidence of signifi-
cant interactions with CKD status (P0.003 and 0.006,
general and disease-specific definitions). By the disease-
specific definition, those without diabetes mellitus were more
likely to have uncontrolled BP. Albuminuria was associated
with greater prevalence of uncontrolled BP regardless of
CKD status or definition used.
Treatment Status
Regardless of definition of uncontrolled BP or CKD status,
use of a single antihypertensive agent was associated with
lower unadjusted rates of uncontrolled BP, whereas the use of
multiple medications was associated with slightly higher
rates; however, with adjustment for potential confounders,
uncontrolled BP decreased with increasing numbers of med-
ications used (Table 2). ACE inhibitors/ARBs were associ-
ated with lower rates of uncontrolled BP for all of the
participants, whereas diuretics and other medications were
significant only for those without CKD, using the general
definition. Of those with CKD and uncontrolled BP (disease-
specific definition), 21.8% were on ACE inhibitors/ARBs
and 23.1% were on multiple medications. There was also
evidence of effect modification by CKD status with medica-
tions (ACE inhibitors/ARBs, P0.097, and other medica-

Discussion
In this national survey, 49% and 52% of the participants with
hypertension who did not have CKD had uncontrolled BP by
the general and disease-specific guidelines, respectively.
Uncontrolled BP was more prevalent in the CKD population,
with 52% and 69%, respectively, having uncontrolled BP by
the general and disease-specific guidelines. These estimates
were not substantially lower than the rates of uncontrolled BP
(62% to 70%) reported in CKD stage 5 patients treated with
hemodialysis.24,25
The substantially higher prevalence of uncontrolled BP in
those with CKD relative to those without CKD is likely
attributed to difficulties associated with controlling BP in
those with CKD. The JNC-7 guidelines1 recommend that
patients with CKD, the vast majority of whom have hyper-
tension, receive aggressive management, including the use of
3 medications at increasing doses; in fact, consensus
evidence shows that an average of 3 medications is needed
to control BP in CKD.26 We found that one third of those with
CKD and hypertension were not treated with medications; of
those on treatment, only 37% and 28% of those with CKD
and hypertension were on ACE inhibitors/ARBs and diuret-
ics, respectively. Moreover, despite their association with a
lower likelihood of uncontrolled BP, only 22% of those with
CKD and uncontrolled BP were on ACE inhibitors/ARBs.
Similarly, after adjustment, only 23% were on multiple
medications. This is despite our findings that uncontrolled BP
rates in CKD were lowest in those on 2 agents, but only
after adjustment for factors contributing to the indication for
treatment (ie, factors associated with poor control requiring
multiple medications). Although this study was not conducted
in a healthcare setting, these results suggest that there may be
an educational deficit in the community with regard to
optimal care of hypertension.
Both patient and provider factors could play a role in the
lack of BP control among those with CKD. Patient factors
that may impede BP control in those with CKD include the

lack of a primary care provider or nonadherence to medica-
tions and dietary guidelines. Nonadherence may result from a
lack of understanding of the importance of BP for preventing
progression and complications of CKD; cognitive difficulties
associated with CKD27; fear or intolerance of medication
adverse effects; and the cost of medications, especially
multiple medications. Hypervolemia and/or increased arterial
stiffness, suggested by the substantially higher pulse pressure
that we found in those with CKD, may also make BP control
very difficult among these patients, even with primary care
and adherence.
The provider's role in controlling BP in CKD involves
both recognizing CKD and knowing and adhering to CKD-
specific guidelines. Previous surveys have shown that pri-
mary care physicians may be unlikely to recognize some risk
factors28 and may only recognize CKD on testing at rates of
59% to 78%.29 A 2007 survey30 showed that physicians in
training (internal medicine residents) selected a BP target of
130/80 mm Hg for patients with CKD 90% of the time,
and 98% identified ACE inhibitors/ARBs as part of the
treatment plan, indicating that knowledge of CKD guidelines
may be improving.
We also found evidence that uncontrolled BP decreased in
both those without and those with CKD from 1999­2002 to
2003­2006, coincident with the release of new hypertension
guidelines in 2003.1 This may be because of greater physician
knowledge and adherence to the revised guidelines or a
greater availability of multiple medications for aggressive
treatment of BP in CKD. In fact, ACE inhibitors/ARBs were
used more frequently in more recent survey years. However,
despite this evidence of a downward trend in uncontrolled
BP, control remains poor, by any definition, in both the
non-CKD and CKD populations.
We also found that BP control was often associated with
demographic characteristics. As with previous studies,6,8,31
we found that older age (usually associated with arterial
stiffness) was strongly associated with uncontrolled BP in
those with and without CKD, regardless of the definition
used. Although a previous study using the NHANES
population-based survey data showed an increased risk of
uncontrolled BP in men in the general population,5 a more
recent study by Ostchega et al6 showed that women were
more likely to have uncontrolled BP. We found that women
with CKD were at greater risk for uncontrolled BP, in
agreement with a previous study of volunteers with CKD,32
but only using the general definition. Nonwhites with CKD
were at greater risk for uncontrolled BP, which has been
shown previously,5,6 possibly because of greater medication
nonadherence and worry about hypertension.33
Socioeconomic factors, including higher level of educa-
tion, insured status, and high income, were not associated
with risk of uncontrolled BP after adjustment for demograph-
ics and clinical characteristics, suggesting that physiological
factors dominate socioeconomic influence on BP control in
the CKD population. This finding highlights the necessity of
better professional and broad-based patient education in
efforts to improve BP control. As expected, diabetes melli-
tus34 was associated with uncontrolled BP in the non-CKD
population but not in those with CKD. This is likely a
reflection of the physiological mechanisms (eg, salt and water
retention because of reduced kidney function, aldosterone
excess, or sympathetic overactivity) that lead to hypertension
once CKD develops, regardless of the underlying causes of
the disease. Interestingly, regardless of CKD status (ie,
kidney function), presence of albuminuria was strongly asso-
ciated with increased prevalence of uncontrolled BP, as has
been reported previously in CKD populations.8,35
There are some limitations of the study that deserve
mention. First, although we chose to examine CKD stages 3
and 4 only to minimize the error associated with single
albuminuria measurements, we almost certainly have some
misclassification of CKD stages 1 and 2 as "non-CKD,"
which may have attenuated some of our comparisons between
the 2 populations. However, because these early stages are
currently neither well-recognized nor universally accepted,36
we believe that many of these participants are likely to be
treated as "non-CKD" in the treatment of their hypertension.
Second, information on treatment nonadherence, which may
be differential by either CKD status or other patient charac-
teristics (eg, age or race), was not available. In addition, we
did not have enough observations to examine various com-
binations of medications as predictors of uncontrolled BP.
Third, as with any observational study, there may be un-
known or unmeasured factors that affect BP control for which
we could not account. For example, psychosocial reasons, eg,
hopelessness, frustration with treatment, and anxiety, have
been proposed as predisposing factors for poor BP control.37
Fourth, although the method of BP measurement (office BP at
a single point in time) in NHANES was the only practical
means of assessing BP in a large national survey, it may not
have captured all of the uncontrolled BP in the population,
particularly in those with CKD whose BP may be elevated
outside the clinic setting (eg, at home or during routine daily
activities), and could be captured with ambulatory BP mon-

itoring. A recent study38 found that white-coat hypertension
and masked hypertension, particularly, were prevalent among
those with CKD; this phenomenon may have further attenu-
ated the differences between participants with and without
that we observed here. Finally, changes in therapy or other
patient characteristics cannot be assessed over time in a
cross-sectional survey. In addition, provider knowledge of BP
control guidelines in CKD and the general population and
quality of patient-provider communication may play signifi-
cant roles in BP control and could not be ascertained here.
Perspectives
Uncontrolled BP is common in the US CKD population,
especially using the newer (more stringent) BP control
guidelines. We showed that, although there was improvement
in rates of uncontrolled BP over time in those without and
with CKD, control remains poor overall. The use of ACE
inhibitors/ARBs and multiple medications was associated
with better BP control, but these therapies may be underused
in those with uncontrolled BP. Nonwhites, older persons,
and women with CKD, who are most likely to have
uncontrolled BP, should be targeted with more aggressive
efforts to control BP.
