OBJECTIVE -- We sought to test the association between stratified levels of familial risk of
diabetes and the prevalence of the disease in the U.S. population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- This study includes 16,388 adults inter-
viewed for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999 and 2004.
Fasting glucose was available for a subsample of 6,004 participants. Familial risk of diabetes was
classified as average, moderate, or high. The prevalence and the odds of having diabetes were
estimated for each risk class after accounting for other risk factors.
RESULTS -- Overall, 69.8% of the U.S. adults were in the average, 22.7% in the moderate,
and 7.5% in the high familial risk for diabetes. The crude prevalence of diabetes for each risk class
was 5.9, 14.8, and 30%, respectively. The graded association between familial risk and preva-
lence of diabetes remained even after accounting for sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, hypertension,
income, and education. Versus people in the average risk class, independently of other risk
factors considered, the odds of having diabetes for people in the moderate and high familial risk
categories were, respectively, 2.3 and 5.5 times higher.
CONCLUSIONS -- In the U.S. population, family history of diabetes has a significant,
independent, and graded association with the prevalence of diabetes. This association not only
highlights the importance of shared genes and environment in diabetes but also opens the
possibility of formally adding family history to public health strategies aimed at detecting and
preventing the disease.
Diabetes Care 30:2517­2522, 2007
Diabetes is a complex metabolic dis-
ease characterized by persistently
elevated concentrations of glucose
in the blood caused by the autoimmune
destruction of the pancreatic -cells (type
1) or by insulin resistance coupled with
relative insulin deficiency (type 2). From
90 to 95% of all cases of diabetes are type
2, and between 5 and 10% are type 1 (1).
There are 21 million people with diabe-
tes in the U.S. and about one-third of
them are unaware they have the disease
(2). Its microvascular complications in-
clude damage to the eyes, kidneys, and
nerves, whereas macrovascular complica-
tions include atherosclerosis and other
cardiovascular conditions (3). The total
cost of diabetes in the U.S. for 2002 was
estimated at $132 billion (4).
Environments with plentiful food and
scarce opportunities for physical activity
are well suited for the development of
obesity and ultimately type 2 diabetes.
Nevertheless, the development of type 2
diabetes in such environments also re-
quires a permissive genetic component.
In this regard, several genetic variants re-
lated to the risk for diabetes have been
reported, but their use to estimate diabe-
tes risk in populations is limited (5­7).
Even so, the accumulation of genetic in-
formation relative to diabetes has the po-
tential to become a very effective public
health tool in the near future. Meanwhile,
we must rely on the use of family history
as a basic approach that clearly hints at
such public health potential (8,9). Family
history is relatively easy to obtain and
conveniently conveys information on
genes and environment shared by close
relatives (10).
The association between family his-
tory of diabetes and risk for the disease
has been well documented (9,11,12). Re-
cent studies have shown the graded and
independent contribution of a positive
family history to the increasing risk for
diabetes in the U.S. population (13­15).
Questions remain, however, on the pub-
lic health applications of this knowledge:
1) What is the best way to incorporate
family history into the already populated
list of risk factors for diabetes? 2) Can
family history be used effectively to im-
prove the detection and prevention of di-
abetes in the U.S. population? The
answers to these questions would benefit
greatly from a thorough analysis of the
association between family history and the
prevalence of diabetes using a large repre-
sentative sample of the U.S. population.
In this study, we provide a brief but
detailed analysis of the association be-
tween family history of diabetes and the
prevalence of the disease in the U.S. adult
population. Our objective is to test the
relative strength and independence of this
association after accounting for well-
known risk factors for diabetes. In partic-
ular, we examine the effect of family
history on the prevalence of diabetes
along a broad range of variation of two
well-established risk factors: age and BMI.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Survey
The National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES) is an annual
survey that uses a complex multistage
sampling scheme designed to obtain a
sample that is statistically representative
of the U.S. population. People selected for
the survey are invited to a home interview
and those who complete the interview are
then invited to a mobile clinic for a series
of physical and laboratory examinations
(assignment to morning or afternoon vis-
its to the clinic is random) (16).
Sample and study population
This study included a 6-year (1999­
2004) sample of adults (aged 18 years,
n  17,061). Most of them (n  15,781)
also received a physical examination,
42.8% (n  6,755) of whom were exam-
ined in the morning. The morning sample
is important for conditions such as diabe-
tes, for which assessment requires an
overnight fasting period. The design of
the study, through the use of sample
weights, allows for the calculation of na-
tional estimates from both the entire in-
terview sample and the morning sample.
These estimates are for a typical year
within the 6-year period.
Main variables
Diabetes cases were classified as diag-
nosed (participant reported receiving a
diagnosis of diabetes from a health care
professional) or undiagnosed (examina-
tion from NHANES revealed a fasting glu-
cose 126 mg/dl in people who reported
no previous diagnosis of diabetes) (1).
The diabetes status of women who re-
ported just a previous diagnosis of gesta-
tional diabetes was determined by their
blood fasting glucose. The total number of
cases of diabetes was calculated by adding
the previously diagnosed cases to the newly
detected cases from the morning sample.
There were no attempts to distinguish be-

tween type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but the
sample was restricted to adults; therefore,
our results apply mostly to type 2 diabetes.
Family history of diabetes was deter-
mined with the following question: in-
cluding living and deceased, were any of
your biological relatives, that is, blood rel-
atives, including grandparents, parents,
brothers, and sisters, ever told by a health
professional that they had diabetes? If the
answer was "yes," then they were asked,
which family member? The possible an-
swers by multiple-choice were mother,
father, mother's mother, mother's father,
father's mother, father's father, brother,
sister, other, refused, or don't know. The
risk of diabetes according to family his-
tory was stratified in three levels as fol-
lows: 1) high: at least two first-degree
relatives or one first-degree and at least
two second-degree relatives with diabetes
from the same lineage; 2) moderate: just
one first-degree and one second-degree
relative with diabetes, or only one first-
degree relative with diabetes, or at least
two second-degree relatives with diabetes
from the same maternal or paternal line;
or 3) average: no family history of diabetes
or, at most, one second-degree relative
with diabetes (17).
Covariates
Standing height was measured, to the
nearest millimeter, with a fixed stadiom-
eter. Weight was measured in pounds
with a digital scale and converted to kilo-
grams. BMI was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters
squared. Blood pressure (systolic or dia-
stolic) was measured three and sometimes
four times, after a 5-min rest. The first
reading was ignored and the average of
the last two or three determinations was
recorded as the blood pressure (16). Hy-
pertension was defined as a diastolic
blood pressure 90 mmHg or a systolic
blood pressure 140 mmHg or the ac-
knowledgment of treatment for high
blood pressure (18).
This study reports the prevalence of
diabetes for five age-groups: 18­34, 35­
44, 45­54, 55­64, and 65 years; four
BMI categories: 18.5, 18.5 to 24.9,
25­29.9, and 30 kg/m2; three ethnic/
racial groups: non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Mexican American
(the only Hispanic group nationally rep-
resented in NHANES); four levels of edu-
cation: less than high school, high school,
more than high school, and unknown;
four family income levels: $35,000,
$35,000 to $54,999, $55,000, and un-
known; and two categories for blood pres-
sure: hypertensive and nonhypertensive.
Exclusions
In addition to excluding participants
younger than 18 years, we excluded people
withthefollowingcharacteristics:pregnant,

over 24 h, or a missing family history of
diabetes. The net sample for this study was
of 16,388 adults with valid data from the
interview, among whom there were 6,004
participants with valid glucose data from
the morning physical examination.
Analyses
The data were handled using SAS version
9.1 (19), and the analyses were performed
using SUDAAN version 9 (20). All analy-
ses followed a methodology that was spe-
cific for complex surveys. In complex
surveys like NHANES, participants are se-
lected at random, but the probability of
selection is not the same for all partici-
pants. To account for the differences in
the probability of selection and the design
of the survey, each participant is assigned
a statistical weight that must be included
in all analyses to obtain unbiased esti-
mates. In this study, the prevalence of di-
agnosed diabetes was estimated among all
participants with an assigned interview
weight; the prevalence of undiagnosed di-
abetes was estimated only among partici-
pants with assigned morning weights;
and the total prevalence of diabetes was
estimated by combining participants with
diagnosed diabetes (interview weights)
and all participants in the morning sam-
ple whose diabetes status was assessed at
the Mobile Exam Center under fasting
conditions (morning weights).
Adjusted odd ratios were obtained
by multiple logistic regression models.

Adjusted prevalence data were obtained
by predicted marginals (multivariate-
adjusted rates expressed as a percent-
age) (21). Age and BMI were included in
all regression models as continuous
variables.
RESULTS -- The crude prevalence of
diabetes (diagnosed, undiagnosed, and
combined) is shown in Table 1 by several
demographic and socioeconomic vari-
ables, BMI, hypertension, and familial
risk of diabetes. In each category, the
crude prevalence of diabetes displayed
well-established trends: It increased with
age, it showed minor sex differences and
major racial/ethnic differences (non-
Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans
showed similar prevalence, but the latter
were a much younger population), it de-
creased as education and income in-
creased, it increased with BMI, and it
was much more prevalent among the
hypertensive.
Overall, the weighted distribution of
the U.S. population according to familial
risk of diabetes was as follows: 22.7%
were in the moderate and 7.5% in the
high familial risk category. The rest were
in the average familial risk category (not
shown in tables). These weighted propor-
tions varied slightly for adult non-
Hispanic whites: 22.1% in the moderate
and 6.3% in the high-risk category. These
proportions increased to 25.4% for mod-
erate and 11.5% for high familial risk in
adult non-Hispanic blacks and to 25.7%
for moderate and 10.3% for high familial
risk among adult Mexican Americans.
Thus, there was a high familial risk in 1 of
16 non-Hispanic white adults and in 1 of
10 non-Hispanic black or Mexican Amer-
ican adults.
The crude prevalence of diabetes is
shown in Table 2 across the same vari-
ables included in Table 1, but this time,
each category of diabetes status was sub-
divided into the three categories for famil-
ial risk. Except for a few instances of no
data in the low BMI category, probably
due to the small number of participants,
the prevalence of diabetes increased with
familial risk within each stratum for each
variable. Overall, the crude prevalence of
diagnosed diabetes was 3.8% in the group
with average risk, but it increased to
24.3% in the group with high risk. Simi-
larly, the crude total prevalence of diabe-
tes (diagnosed or undiagnosed) increased
from 5.9 to 30.0% from the first to the
third level of family risk.
Given the strong influences of age and
BMI on the prevalence of diabetes, we
tested separately the influence of familial
risk stratification on the prevalence of di-
abetes across commonly used age and
BMI categories, while controlling for
other key variables (Fig. 1). In virtually
every stratum of age (Fig. 1A) and BMI
(Fig. 1B), there was a clear stratification of
risk for diabetes according to family his-
tory. Versus the average-risk category, the
adjusted overall prevalence of diabetes in
each case was significantly higher for the
high and the moderate familial risk cate-
gories (P  0.0001, t statistic).
Finally, unadjusted and sequentially
adjusted odd ratios for diabetes are shown
in Fig. 2. According to this figure, people
with moderate familial risk, indepen-
dently of several important covariates,
had between two and three times the odds
of having diabetes as did people whose
familial risk was average. In contrast, de-
pending on the factors accounted for,
people with high familial risk had five to
seven times the odds of having diabetes as
people with average familial risk.
CONCLUSIONS -- This study has
shown in detail that family history of dia-
beteshasagradedassociationwiththeprev-
alence of diabetes in the U.S. population
and that this association is detectable within
strata of several well-established risk factors
for diabetes. Moreover, the risk of diabetes
imposed by family history is evident along a
broad range of adult ages and BMI, even
after adjusting for relevant covariates. With
these results, this study provides 1) defini-
tive evidence of the independence and sig-
nificance of the association between family
history and the prevalence of diabetes in the
U.S. population and 2) reliable estimates of
the prevalence of familial risk of diabetes in
the U.S. population: about 1 of every 3
adultshasamoderatetohighriskandabout
1 of every 13 adults has a high risk as deter-
mined by the algorithm we used
(14,15,17). Incidentally, this algorithm
could be expanded to include other first-
and second-degree relatives (sons, daugh-
ters, aunts, and uncles).
Previous studies have indicated that,
versus people without a family history of
diabetes, those who have a family history
of diabetes are two to six times as likely to
have type 2 diabetes (9). More specifi-
cally, a recent study based on NHANES
data found that 1) family history of diabe-
tes was significantly and independently
associated with diabetes in U.S. adults
(based on self-reports) and 2) the strength
of the association was related to the type
and number of relatives involved (13).
Even though the definitions of family his-
tory are not comparable, our study is in
agreement with this previous study. Our
results add the information that a strati-
fied familial risk of diabetes can be linked
not only to the prevalence of diabetes de-
tected from self-reports, but also to the
prevalence of undiagnosed and diagnosed

diabetes, separately or combined. This
suggests that the association between
family history of diabetes and the preva-
lence is not due to recall bias among those
who already know that they have the dis-
ease. It cannot be proven because NHANES
contains no information on whether or
not the knowledge of family history pre-
ceded the diagnosis of diabetes. However,
our results (Table 1) indicate that family
history might influence the knowledge of
having diabetes. Overall, undiagnosed
cases constituted about one-third of the
total cases of diabetes. This proportion di-
minished to about one-fourth among the
moderate and high familial risk catego-
ries. In other words, people with diabetes
are more likely to know that they have the
disease when they are at an elevated famil-
ial risk.
A previous NHANES-based study an-
ticipated the findings of the present study
(14), but this earlier study was not de-
signed to be a direct test of the indepen-
dence of the association between family
history and prevalence of diabetes.
Rather, it was designed to test the use of
family history and BMI as screening tools
for undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. pop-
ulation. Nevertheless, with the same risk
stratification, this previous study showed
that the prevalence of diabetes (diagnosed
or undiagnosed) is positively associated
with familial risk. Our study has con-
firmed these results and has provided a
detailed account of the strength and inde-
pendence of the association between fa-
milial risk and the prevalence of diabetes
(diagnosed, undiagnosed, and combined)
in the U.S. population.
In conclusion, having demonstrated
that family history of diabetes is indeed a
powerful independent risk factor for the
disease, our efforts should now be di-
rected toward translating this knowledge
for use in public health programs de-
signed to detect and prevent diabetes. For
that translation to occur, however, further
research is needed to give the use of family
history a place as a public health strategy
against diabetes: First, the use of family
history as a predictor should be tested
more often in large prospective studies,
just to be certain that the ascertainment of
the familial risk actually precedes the dis-
ease status. Second, family history of dia-
betes should be considered not as a
dichotomous variable (present/absent)
but rather as a variable whose influence
on the disease is graded. Third, a univer-
sally agreed-upon definition of family his-
tory of diabetes that is also simple to
collect would be necessary to establish
and compare familial risk across a variety
of populations. Fourth, our results show
that stratified familial risk, combined with
other readily available indicators of diabe-
tes risk, could be a great tool to identify
segments of the population at high risk for
the disease. The incorporation of family
history into screening and prevention
programs for diabetes, however, needs to
be accomplished as rigorously as possible.
That is, the value added by family history to
these programs must be evaluated and
found to be significant and cost-effective
(8,22).
