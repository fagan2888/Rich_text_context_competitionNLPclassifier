Abstract: Based on initial research findings by Williams and Bargh (2008) and Kang,
Williams, Clark, Gray and Bargh (2011) on the interaction between interpersonal and
physical warmth, theoretical models such as cognitive scaffolding and the importance of
evaluations of interpersonal warmth in trust-based decisions, this experiment investigated
the effect of temperature priming on 30 pairs of British university students with hot and
cold objects on frequency of cooperation in a game of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.
Participants were found to cooperate significantly more frequently when primed with hot
objects than with cold objects, supporting the assertion that physical warmth sensation
positively affects interpersonal trust evaluation. No support was found for the prediction
that male-male pairs would cooperate less than female-female pairs. The implications of
these findings to evolutionary and developmental theories of interpersonal warmth are
discussed.

Introduction
The proposition that there is a link between real world temperature sensation and
feelings of psychological warmth has found increasing support from neurobiological and
developmental studies. Harlow's (1958) study on attachment in infant macaques was the
first to show that physical warmth can replace interpersonal warmth, to a certain extent:
infant macaques that were reared with a warm cloth-surrogate were less socially damaged
by their maternal deprivation than those raised without such warmth (a finding that has
parallels with humans; see, for example, Bargh and Shalev, 2012). In their study of 2012
Bargh and Shalev were able to demonstrate that people tend to self-regulate their feelings
of interpersonal warmth with applications of physical warmth. This shows that humans can
Temperature priming and cooperation

also use physical warmth to replace interpersonal warmth. It also demonstrates the inter-
relatedness of interpersonal and physical warmth.
In addition to behavioural findings, a number of neuroanatomical studies have also
lent support to the notion of a link between physical and interpersonal warmth (and
similarities here between human and non-human primates). Craig, Chen, Bandy and
Reiman, through lesion studies, for example, suggested that temperature sensation is
located in the insular cortex, rather than the parietal somatosensory cortices utilized in
touch sensation (Craig et al., 2000). This study also posited a link between physical warmth
sensation and emotional warmth sensation. Craig et al. suggest that the right anterior insula
is "integral to mentally generating the image of one's physical state that underlies basic
emotions", including interpersonal evaluations (Craig et al., 2000, p. 188). This finding is
supported by Stephanie et al.'s (2011) studies on individuals whose insulae were implanted
with electrodes. By stimulating the electrodes in this region they were able to isolate
several functionalities of different insula regions, finding that stimulating the dorsal
posterior insula elicited "a subgroup of warmth...sensations" (Stephanie et al., 2011, p.
137).
In recent years neuroimaging techniques have also been used to add to our
knowledge of the relationship between interpersonal and physical warmth. Sanfey, Rilling,
Aronson, Nystrom and Cohen (2003) viewed the brains of participants using fMRI during
an economics game known as the Ultimatum Game. They found significant activity in the
anterior insula during decision-making events in these games, indicating that interpersonal
trust evaluations, (previously shown by Winston, Strange, O'Doherty and Dolan (2002) to
be heavily based upon "warmth" criteria), may play a part in economic decision making.
This finding is supported by van den Bos, van Dijk, Westendberg, Rombouts and Crone's
(2009) research which demonstrated insula cortex activation during games involving trust
and reciprocation. Moreover, the existence of a "hard-wired" link between interpersonal
warmth and physical warmth is also supported by Meyer-Lindenberg's (2008) research into
borderline personality disorder where abnormal activity in the insula cortex mirrored
abnormal patterns of trust in relationships. These findings implicating the insula with both
interpersonal warmth evaluation and interpersonal trust evaluation support Williams and
Bargh's (2008, p. 606) suggestion that interpersonal warmth information forms the "first
pass" of evaluating interpersonal trust. Thus, manipulating a participant's evaluation of
interpersonal warmth, by controlling their sensation of physical warmth, may conceivably
influence an individual's evaluation of interpersonal trust. This is the premise on which the
current study is based.
Kang, Williams, Clark, Gray and Bargh (2011) provide the most persuasive
evidence for the dual functionality of the insula in processing interpersonal and physical
warmth sensations. Using fMRI scans during economic games, their experiment found that
the left-anterior insular region was activated more strongly when making a trust decision
when primed with a cold object than with a hot object. In contrast to Williams and Bargh's
(2008) findings that both hot and cold objects alter interpersonal trust, Kang et al. (2011)
found that the insula only showed increased activity when participants were primed with
the cold object. This might suggest that it is only the cold condition that alters interpersonal
warmth evaluation; warm conditions may simply reflect the baseline level, although this
Temperature priming and cooperation

was not investigated further.
This recent neurobiological evidence is supportive of earlier developmental and
consequent evolutionary explanations of the connection between physical warmth,
interpersonal warmth and cooperation. Asch (1946) found that the presence of the word
"warm" or "cold" altered participant's impressions of an ambiguously described person.
Asch (1946) further argued that interpersonal warmth factors are important in the
evaluation of trust. Trust evaluations are a fundamental aspect of cooperation and
reciprocation, and have been suggested to be fundamental to the evolution of non-kin
related cooperative behaviours (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981). Developmental theorists,
such as Mandler (1992) and MacDonald (1992), state that warmth is an important aspect of
early childhood experiences of caregivers, necessary for healthy childhood development. It
is argued by Williams and Bargh (2008) that these influential early experiences of warmth
are associated with other feelings of warmth at a later date. They state that, "[due to] these
frequent early life experiences with [a] trustworthy caregiver, a close mental association
should develop between the concepts of physical warmth and psychological warmth"
(Williams and Bargh, 2008, p. 606). It is further argued that feelings of physical warmth in
later life may "activate memories of other feelings associated with warmth [such as trust
and comfort]" due to their earlier association with primary caregivers (Williams and Bargh,
2008, p. 606).
Allman (2000) argued that as the brain evolved from a relatively simple organ into
an incredibly complex system, pre-existing areas of the brain were co-opted into
performing more complex tasks. Thus, the insula may have originated as a module for
measuring physical temperature, and later, as complex social structures emerged, became
adapted to evaluate "friendliness" and "trustworthiness", as suggested by Williams, Huang
and Bargh (2009). Williams, Huang and Bargh's (2009) "cognitive scaffolding model"
attests that due to having common cognitive media, physical concepts such as temperature,
and abstract concepts such as interpersonal warmth, are experienced similarly. They also
argue that cognitive scaffolding is an innate, natural process linked to evolutionary
mechanisms. Although Wilson (2002) argued that there was little evidence for the
scaffolding of abstract constructs, subsequent support for this theoretical model is found in
research into numerous abstract psychological concepts; such as time (Boroditsky, 2000),
moral disgust (Wheatley and Haidt, 2005) and good and evil (Meier, Hauser, Robinson,
Friesen and Schjeldahl, 2007).
Williams and Bargh (2008) predicted that, due to the developmental association
between physical and emotional warmth, and the apparent dual function of the insula in
processing both physical and emotion warmth information, tactile experiences of warmth
should "activate concepts or feelings" associated with interpersonal warmth. In their study,
they demonstrated that by priming a participant with a warm or cold object, the
participant's judgment of a fictitious individual's personality was "warmer" (more
generous, trustworthy and friendly) or "colder" (less generous, trustworthy and friendly)
respectively. Williams and Bargh (2008) were rigorous in their separation of interpersonal
warmth criteria from other, non-warmth related criteria. This allowed them to determine
that the effects of temperature priming were solely related to interpersonal warmth, and not
merely a mood "halo" effect. However, by their use of criteria semantically linked to
Temperature priming and cooperation

warmth or cold, it is difficult to determine whether their results were actually due to
increased feelings of interpersonal warmth, or whether the participants were merely
associating the feelings of physical warmth with the wording of the questions. Further
research is required to validate their findings.
In addition to testing the effects of temperature priming on interpersonal warmth
evaluation, Williams and Bargh (2008) tested its effects on generosity. They found that
participants primed with a cold object were more likely to choose a gift framed as a gift for
themselves than a gift framed as a gift for a friend. The opposite was found when
participants were primed with hot objects. This demonstrates that temperature priming may
well have an effect on real-world behaviours, such as generosity.
Kang et al. (2011) also studied the effects of temperature priming on games of
economics. They found that participants primed by touching a cold object were less willing
to invest with an anonymous partner compared to participants primed with a hot object.
This provides evidence of prior temperature affecting cooperation: influencing participants
to cooperate less in the cold condition, and vice versa. Furthermore, it demonstrates
temperature priming having a tangible effect on real-life choices. In a similar study
IJzerman and Semin (2009) also found that when participants were seated in a warm room
they felt interpersonally closer to the experimenter than those seated in a cold room, and
that this effect was bi-directional: participant's perception of room temperature could be
altered by placing them closer to other participants, simulating interpersonal closeness.
This provides further evidence that temperature priming affects interpersonal evaluations. It
is a fair assumption that these feelings of interpersonal closeness are likely to induce higher
levels of cooperation in participants.
However, previous research provides conflicting evidence as to how initial acts of
generosity affect decisions later on. Garapin, Llerena and Michel (2011) found that when
participants play a game of Prisoner's Dilemma, after playing a donation game, they were
less likely to cooperate. This suggests that prior instances of generosity may result in lower
levels of generosity at a later date, which may have a significant effect on a repeated
measures design. Thus, we can expect participants in a second game to be less cooperative
than in their first game. Also, we may expect participants experiencing hot temperature
priming first to score lower than participants experiencing cold temperature priming first,
as participants may be more cooperative in the first round. Conversely, Axelrod and
Hamilton (1981) suggest that prior instances of defection will be punished by further
defection. From this, we may predict that in conditions where participants experience cold
temperature priming first, cooperation will be less likely in the subsequent hot round than it
would have been if the hot round was first due to the predicted higher likelihood of
defection in the cold condition.
The research reviewed suggests that there is a close connection between the
sensation of physical warmth and the sensation of interpersonal warmth. However, only
Kang et al. (2011) have directly studied the effects of temperature priming on cooperation;
a study where participants were required to take part in an abstract investment game which
may have been somewhat removed from their day-to-day experience of cooperative
decision making. In the current study we make use of "iterated prisoner's dilemma", a well-
established method of investigating tendencies to cooperate (or defect) within the field of
Temperature priming and cooperation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -56-
human behavioural ecology (Workman and Reader, 2008). Given that this game is played
by two participants many times with both having the opportunity to reward or penalize their
partner for previous decisions it is more likely to mirror real-life cooperative decisions than
the task used by Kang et al. In light of the findings of Kang et al., that hot temperature
priming influenced participants to be more cooperative than participants who were
temperature primed with a cold object, the current study makes use of iterated prisoner's
dilemma to examine the inter-relatedness of physical warmth and interpersonal warmth,
and its potential to influence trust decisions, by testing the effects of temperature priming
on reciprocation between two participants, with tangible rewards for either cooperating or
defecting.
Materials and Methods
Participants
The participants comprised of 60, 19-29 year old students from a British university,
forming 30 pairs, recruited through opportunity sampling. To counterbalance the
experiment, 15 pairs were randomly assigned to the hot-first condition while the remaining
15 pairs were randomly assigned to the cold-first condition. Six pairs were male and 24
were female. These were split evenly between the two conditions to control for the effects
that gender may have on cooperation (Kerr and MacCoun, 1985). As Axelrod and
Hamilton's (1981) explanation of reciprocation, and the subsequent development of the
iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, depend on individuals being capable of reciprocation at a later
date, participants were paired with either friends or housemates. This ensured that there
was ample opportunity for reciprocation of cooperation at a later date.
Materials
The experiment measured how temperature priming affects the level of cooperation
displayed by participants. Participants were temperature primed by holding hot or cold
objects during the two conditions of the experiment respectively, forming the two
independent variables. The level of cooperation displayed by the participants was measured
using the total score obtained by each pair in a game of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The
apparatus used in the experiment consisted of four cards, two of which had "co-operate"
printed on them and two had "defect". One of each was given to each participant so they
could cooperate or defect without revealing their answer to their partner beforehand. Gel-
chemical hand warmers were used as the hand-held hot objects and freezer packs were used
as the cold objects. The game of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma was used to measure levels of
reciprocity. This measure was chosen because it has been proposed that it is a model for
real-world reciprocation, supported by Axelrod and Hamilton's (1981) research on game-
theory.
Incentives, in the form of small chocolates or sweets, were given to persuade
participants to engage in the game. These incentives fulfilled the criteria for an iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma points system: when both participants finish with equal scores, each
participant received two sweets, for a total of four. However, when one participant finished
with more points than the other, they received three sweets and their partner received none.
Temperature priming and cooperation

This provides both an incentive to work together and a temptation to defect, and would
more accurately represent real-world cooperation. Lönnqvist, Verkasalo, and Walkowitz
(2011) found that when a game of Prisoner's Dilemma was incentivized, participants were
less generous.
Procedure
Participants were required to complete two consecutive games of iterated Prisoner's
Dilemma. During the first game, both participants held either a hot object first (hot-first
condition) or a cold object first (cold-first condition). During the second game, their held
object was reversed, creating a repeated measures design. Thus, the hot-first condition was
run as: hot first, cold second; and vice-versa for the cold-first condition. For each pair in the
hot-first condition, another pair was placed in the cold-first condition to counterbalance the
design. Whether the participants were placed in the hot-first or cold-first condition was
recorded in order to investigate whether prior co-operation had any effect on subsequent
decisions. As this experiment sought only to discern whether there is a difference between
hot temperature priming and cold temperature priming, not how they change from baseline
rates of cooperation, there was no control condition.
To play the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, participants place a card stating "co-
operate" or "defect" onto the table face-down. Once both participants have selected their
option, participants were prompted to turn over their card to reveal their decision. This
ensured that neither participant knew what the other had chosen prior to making their own
decision. The score was recorded after each round. Participants repeated this for a total of
five rounds while holding the hot or cold object, depending on whether they are in the hot-
first condition or cold-first condition. They then repeated this procedure holding the
opposite object from the first game. The number of rounds to be played was not revealed to
the participants. Instead, they were told that the number of rounds to be played is random
and has been determined beforehand, and that the experimenter will announce when the
game has finished. This is necessitated by the condition of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
that states that if individuals can foresee a distinct end to the game, the most effective
strategy changes from one of mutual cooperation to one of constant defection (Axelrod and
Hamilton, 1981).
As Russel and Fiske (2008) found that participants judged competing targets as less
warm than cooperating targets, care was taken to use neutral language, avoiding language
that would suggest the participants were in a competition against each other, or that they
were to cooperate with each other. For instance, language such as "you will be playing
against" was replaced by "you will be playing with". The interactions between the
experimenter and the participants were scripted to ensure parity across all cases.
Trivers (1971) and Dawkins (1976) suggest that many instances of cooperation
between individuals occur through kin-altruism. In this experiment, participants were
controlled for degree of relatedness by excluding pairs who are related to one another.
Furthermore, Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) suggest that the primary driving force behind
cooperation between non-kin is reciprocal altruism. They state that for reciprocal altruism
to function, the possibility of future meetings, and future reciprocation, between individuals
must be high. To ensure this mechanism functions for participants, they were controlled for
Temperature priming and cooperation

degree of familiarity by pairing participants with friends.
There is a large body of research suggesting that males and females approach
cooperation differently, either due to biological factors (Buss 1989; Buss and Schmitt 1993;
van Vugt, De Cremer and Janssen, 2007) or to socio-cultural processes (Sell and Kuipers,
2009). Kerr and MacCoun (1985) found that when participants played a cooperation game
with male partners, both men and women were less cooperative. In order to control for this
effect, participants were controlled for gender by grouping them into same-sex pairs. This
also suggests that male-male pairs may be less cooperative than female-female pairs.
Provided there are an equal number of male-male pairs in the hot-first condition and the
cold-first condition, this will not need to be controlled for.
As IJzerman and Semin (2009) found that the ambient temperature of a room can
affect participants' perception of interpersonal warmth, the experiment took place indoors
at room temperature. IJzerman and Semin (2009) also found that the distance between
participants affected ratings of interpersonal warmth. To control for this, participants were
seated a set distance of one meter from each other. This distance was decided upon as it is
between the upper and lower limit for conversational distance between friends in the
United Kingdom, as discussed in Stratton, Tekippe and Flick (1973). Krauss, Huang and
Keltner (2010), found that touching another person can promote cooperation between
individuals. In order to prevent this from affecting the data, participants were not allowed
to touch each other for the duration of the experiment. Furthermore, participants were not
allowed to inform each other of their decisions during the experiment.
Ethical issues
This experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Bath Spa University in
accordance with BPS guidelines.
Results
The descriptive data revealed a difference in mean scores across the hot and cold
conditions. As shown in Table 1, the mean scores indicate that participants score more
highly in terms of cooperation following the hot priming condition.

priming on pairs' combined scores over five rounds of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.
The between factors variable was whether the sequence for pairs was hot followed by cold
or cold followed by hot trials. The within factors variable was cooperation scores following
hot or cold priming. The scores for the hot condition were significantly higher than the
scores for the cold condition (F1,28
= 8.54; p = 0.007) irrespective of whether hot preceded
cold or cold preceded hot (F1,28
= 0.04; p = 0.85). Therefore the prediction that hot
temperature priming would result in higher frequency of cooperation than cold temperature
priming was supported.
Breakdown analyses
It was found that male-male pairs did not cooperate to a significantly different
degree than female-female pairs, indicating that sex did not have an effect on frequency of
cooperation (see Table 3). Further analysis found that practice effects did not significantly
affect participant's scores, as the mean for the total pair first round scores of 15.70 and the
mean for the total pair second round scores of 14.93 were not significantly different (see
Table 4). Also, it was found that whether participants experienced hot temperature priming
first or cold temperature priming first did not significantly affect the results. The mean total
pair scores of 30.53 for the hot-first condition and 30.73 for the cold-first condition were
not significantly different (see Table 5).
After converting the data into binary format, with a higher hot score than cold being
represented by 1, and a higher cold score than hot being represented by 0, it was found that
twice as many of the participants cooperated more frequently in the hot condition than the
cold condition. This is demonstrated in Table 2.
Table 2. Frequency of Higher Hot Scores and Higher Cold Scores (n = 30)
Frequency
Hot Score Higher 20
Cold Score Higher 10
Both the scores for the hot condition and the cold condition were negatively
skewed, with hot scores having a skewness of -0.76 and cold scores a skewness of -0.32.
However, these are within the tolerances for parametric analysis. The kurtosis values of the
hot score and cold score were 1.84 and -.32, indicating a normal distribution. There was
one outlier in the data, with a hot score of 18 and a cold score of 11. However, these scores
are both within the existing range of participant's hot scores (11-19) and cold scores (11-
18) respectively. Thus, this outlier was not excluded from analysis.
An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the total pair scores for
male-male pairs and female-female pairs. This test was conducted to evaluate Kerr and
MacCoun's (1985) suggestion that individuals are less cooperative when paired with male
partners, and its potential effect on the data. Total pair scores were found by combining
each participant's score in a pair over both hot and cold conditions and adding it to their
partner's. It was found that there was no significant difference between male-male pairs
(M=32.14, SD=2.55) and female-female pairs (M = 30.17, SD = 2.77), t(28) = 1.64, p =
.105 (one-tailed) (see Table 3). The magnitude of the differences in the means (mean
Temperature priming and cooperation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -60-
difference = 1.97, 95% CI: -.44 to 1.18) was only moderate (eta squared = .09). Thus any
variation between males and females is due to chance. This does not support the research
prediction that female-female pairs will cooperate more frequently than male-male pairs.
This allows us to treat male-male pairs and female-female pairs as equal for comparison
between hot scores and cold scores.
Table 3. Difference in Means between Male-Male and Female-Female Total Pair Scores (n
= 30)
Total Pair Score
Male-Male Pairs 32.14 (2.55)
Female-Female Pairs 30.17 (2.77)
Total 30.67 (2.77)
To determine whether practice effects affected participant's frequency of
cooperation, a paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare participants' mean first
game scores to participants' mean second game scores, disregarding which condition was
in effect. Although the scores for the first game (M=15.70, SD=1.80) were higher than the
scores for the second game (M=14.93, SD=1.84) (see Table 4), this difference was not
significant: t(29) = 1.81, p = .08 (two-tailed). The magnitude in the difference of the means
(mean difference = .770, 95% CI: -.98 to 1.63) was moderate (eta squared = .10). Thus any
variation in first game scores and second game scores is down to chance. Therefore, the
prediction that there would be a difference between participant's scores in the first round
and second round was not supported. This indicates that practice effects were not a
confounding variable in the data.
Table 4. Difference in Mean Scores between the First and Second Game Scores (n = 30)
Game Score
First Game 15.70 (1.80)
Second Game 14.93 (1.84)
Total 15.32 (1.41)
To determine whether the order in which participants experienced temperature
priming affected participants' frequency of cooperation, an independent-samples t-test was
conducted comparing the total pair scores for the hot-first condition to the total pair scores
for the cold-first condition. The scores for the hot-first condition were calculated by
summing each pair in the hot-first condition's total score over both the hot condition and
the cold condition. This gives a total game score for each of the pairs in the hot-first
condition. The scores for the cold-first condition were calculated using the same method. It
was found that there was no significant difference between the hot-first condition
(M=30.53, SD=2.23) and the cold-first condition (M=30.73, SD=3.37), t(28) = -.192, p =
.85 (2-tailed, see Table 5). The magnitude in the difference of the means (mean difference
= .200, 95% CI: -2.34 to 1.94) was small (eta squared = .02). Thus any variation in between
the hot-first condition and the cold-first condition is down to chance. Therefore, the
prediction that there would be a different rate of cooperation in the hot-first condition and
Temperature priming and cooperation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -61-
the cold-first condition was not supported and the two conditions may be treated as equal
for the final statistical analysis.
Table 5. Difference in Mean Scores between the Hot-First and Cold-First Conditions (n =
30)
Total Pair Score
Hot-First Condition 30.53 (2.23)
Cold-First Condition 30.73 (3.37)
Total 30.67 (2.77)
Finally, the "hot score" and "cold score" of the participants were analyzed using a
paired-sample t-test. The "hot score" was found by combining each participant's total score
over every round in the hot condition and adding it to their partner's total. This gives a
combined score for each pair in the hot condition. The "cold score" is found using the same
procedure in the cold condition. As the hypothesis predicted that the hot condition would
result in higher rates of cooperation, a one-tailed test was used to analyze the data.
To assess the normality of the sample, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality
was conducted on the hot scores and cold scores. As the significance of this statistic is >.05
we can assume the sample meets the assumptions of normality required to conduct a paired
samples t-test (see Figures 1 and 2). The scores between pairs are independent from one
another, as each experiment was conducted consecutively, preventing one pair's score
influencing another's.

Discussion
Statistical analysis of the data found that pairs scored significantly higher in the hot
condition (M = 15.90) than in the cold condition (M = 14.77), indicating greater frequency
of cooperation. There was no significant difference found between male-male pairs' and
female-female pairs' mean scores, although male-male pairs did score slightly higher. This
suggests that differences in cooperation between the sexes were due to chance, which
allowed male-male pairs and female-female pairs to be treated as equal in the statistical
analysis.
Previous research provides conflicting evidence as to which condition would
promote higher cooperation, the hot-first condition or the cold-first condition. As discussed
earlier, Garapin et al. (2011) suggest that prior instances of generosity may result in lower
levels of generosity at a later date, suggesting a lower frequency of cooperation in the hot-
first condition than the cold-first condition. However, Axelrod and Hamilton's (1981)
research suggests the opposite effect. In order to investigate this, the hot-first and cold-first
conditions were analyzed. No support was found for either suggestion as the hot-first
condition and cold-first condition did not differ significantly. Furthermore, comparative
analysis of the first games and second games found that they were not significantly
different, suggesting practice effects did not significantly affect participant's scores either.
These findings support the initial prediction that participants would be more
cooperative after being primed with hot objects and less cooperative after being primed
with cold objects. This is in keeping with Kang et al.'s (2011) finding that participants were
less willing to donate to an anonymous partner in an economics game if they were primed
Temperature priming and cooperation
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -64-
with cold objects than if they were primed with hot objects. This finding is also supportive
of Williams and Bargh's (2008) finding that temperature priming participants with hot
objects resulted in more generous behaviour. Hence it is suggested that, as in these previous
studies, experiencing physical warmth leads directly to increased feelings of interpersonal
warmth and, in turn, to cooperation in the current study. It might however be suggested that
there is a simpler explanation. It is possible that the cold priming condition leads to a
reduction in the likelihood of acting cooperatively since, during our ancestral past, cold
ambient temperatures would have led to an increase in thermoregulatory burden. This
second explanation is difficult to refute, but since it is clear that our ancestors would have
been dependent on conspecifics during periods of stress and that a lack of cooperation may
well have led to the removal from future reciprocal aid relationships (Trivers, 1971; 1985;
see also Schilbach et al., in press) we feel that this alternative explanation is a less likely to
account for our findings.
The discovered effect of temperature priming on cooperation also provides indirect
support to the theory that there is a common neurological medium for the perception of
physical warmth and interpersonal warmth in the brain (Allman, 2000). The support is
indirect as the experiment did not measure insula activity during the economics trust game,
the connection is an assumption based on previous research by Kang et al. (2011) and
Stephanie et al. (2011). However, it adds to the body of evidence demonstrating a clear
connection between physical warmth sensation and interpersonal warmth evaluation.
Furthermore, it demonstrates a connection between physical warmth sensation and
interpersonal trust evaluation, which Williams and Bargh (2008) consider is partially
dependant on interpersonal warmth evaluation. This experiment's findings also provide
indirect support for Mandler (1992) and Williams et al.'s (2009) theory that complex
psychological concepts are founded on more primitive concepts, otherwise known as
cognitive scaffolding. Again, it does not provide direct support, as the iterated Prisoner's
Dilemma does not directly measure interpersonal warmth. Instead, it measures frequency of
cooperation, which was used as a proxy for interpersonal warmth evaluation. While this
proxy was used by Williams and Bargh (2008) and Kang et al. (2011), future research
might benefit from a measure directly studying the effects of interpersonal warmth
evaluation.
If, as Trivers' suggests, we have a lengthy evolutionary history of reciprocation and
an evolutionary heritage of dependence on conspecifics for our survival (Trivers, 1971;
1985; Schilbach et al., in press) then it is likely that we have evolved a tendency to seek
affiliation and rapport. Arguably such affiliation is likely to be based around feelings of
interpersonal warmth that develop as individuals engage in mutually cooperative
behaviours. Since there is clear aforementioned evidence that the neuroarchitecture
underlying interpersonal warmth has "piggybacked" on top of that which underlies physical
warmth then perhaps the inclusion of the iterated prisoner's dilemma (with its built in
repeated opportunities for affiliation) into behavioural studies of this nature might help to
further our knowledge of this relationship.
Future studies of this nature might be conducted within a developmental framework
in order to investigate the development of "cognitive structuring". Such a study might help
to test Mandler's (1992) assertion that complex psychological concepts develop from
Temperature priming and cooperation

simpler physical sensations in an individual's lifetime, or Allman's (2000) assertion that
the connection between physical and interpersonal warmth is an innate evolutionary
adaptation, and is present from birth.
In conclusion, it was found that hot temperature priming resulted in a higher
frequency of cooperation than cold temperature priming. This is supportive of previous
studies into the effects of temperature priming on interpersonal warmth evaluation,
interpersonal trust evaluation and performance in economic games. It also provides indirect
support for the dual-functionality of the insula, and theoretical models based on this
observation. Such findings might have implications for the evolutionary and developmental
models of interpersonal warmth in relation to cooperation.
