Unnecessary emergency
medical services transport
associated with alcohol
intoxication
Christine Van Dillen1 and Sun Hyu Kim2
Abstract
Objective: This study investigated medically unnecessary emergency medical services (EMS)
transportation by comparing non-intoxicated versus intoxicated patients who did not receive
emergency department (ED) treatment but utilized EMS transport.
Methods: Patients who used EMS but did not receive ED treatment were classified into non-
intoxicated and intoxicated groups. Reasons for not receiving ED treatment were categorized
according to whether the decision was made by the patient against medical advice or if the decision
was based on a physician's evaluation and their recommendations.
Results: There were 212 patients reviewed; 120 in the non-intoxicated group and 92 in the
intoxicated group. The intoxicated group had a higher proportion of males than the non-
intoxicated group. The most common cause of non-disease symptoms in the intoxicated group was
assault. In the non-intoxicated group, the most common reason for the lack of ED treatment was
that treatment could take place on an outpatient basis, while in the intoxicated group, the reason
was lack of patient cooperation.
Conclusions: The intoxicated group was older, male and more likely to present with symptoms
not related to a disease process than those in the non-intoxicated group when using unnecessary
EMS transport.

When reviewing all patients who first arrive
into the emergency department (ED), the
proportion of EMS transport is about 10%.1
Unfortunately, there are times when EMS
and the ED are used unnecessarily, which
leads to wasted socioeconomic resources.
Ideally, emergency medicine would match
`the right source to the right patient at the
right place at the right time'.2,3 Medically
unnecessary EMS transportation has been
investigated in several studies that were based
on the hospital diagnosis and results of
ED treatment.4­16 However, to date there is
little evidence focusing on the patients
who receive no ED treatment after the use
of EMS transport. Therefore, the objective
of this preliminary study was to investigate
medically unnecessary EMS transports by
comparing the differences between patients
who on arrival were found to be non-
intoxicated versus intoxicated. The study
focused on individuals who did not receive
treatment at the ED although they utilized
EMS transport.
Patients and methods
Patient population
A retrospective review was conducted for
patients who were transported to the ED via
EMS, yet did not subsequently receive treat-
ment at the ED. Data were collected for 6
months from September 2014 to February
2015 at a single academic university hospital
in Ulsan (Department of Emergency
Medicine, University of Ulsan College of
Medicine, Ulsan University Hospital,
Ulsan, Republic of Korea), which is located
on the southeast coast of South Korea.
In this region of South Korea, the local fire
departments are responsible for 119 (emer-
gency contact number in South Korea)
responses and transportation from each
scene to hospital. As an alternative to seeking
an ED, some outpatient clinics are operating
during the weekday night-times and the
afternoons at the weekends. However, most
patients using EMS transport in South Korea
are transported to the ED and not to the
outpatient clinics.
This study was approved by the relevant
institutional review board (no. UUH-IRB-
2015-04-001) at Ulsan University Hospital,
Ulsan, South Korea. Written or verbal
informed consent were exempted due to
the retrospective nature of the study.
Data collection
The EMS run sheets that were submitted to
the hospital after transportation were retro-
spectively reviewed. Data were excluded
if the run sheet was not submitted to the
hospital, the run sheet was unreadable, or
the patient was treated at the ED after
transportation. All the EMS run sheets had
the same format. Data were collected and
several different categories were analysed:
general demographics, clinical demograph-
ics, prehospital treatment and reason for
lack of treatment in the ED. The general
demographics that were collected included:
agency who performed the prehospital treat-
ment and transport, age, sex, time, day of
EMS use, elapsed time from EMS call to
scene and EMS call to hospital ED, occu-
pation of patient, location from which the
call was placed. Age and time of EMS use
were classified later into subgroups. Clinical
demographics that were recorded included:
past medical history, list of symptoms (later
categorized as disease or non-disease related),
vital signs, level of consciousness, pupil light
reflex and glucose level. Symptoms were
recorded as disease or non-disease on the
run sheet by the fire fighters, so the study
used the classification of symptoms based on
the information on the run sheet. Prehospital
treatment data that were collected included
airway intervention, oxygen, electrocardio-
gram cardiac monitor, intravenous line, drug
use, immobilization, wound care, adjuvants
to keep a patient warm or cool, automated
external defibrillator monitor, direct medical

the riding fire fighters.
Reasons for no ED treatment
Reasons for not receiving ED treatment were
further divided into two groups: (i) those
patients who made this decision against
medical advice; and (ii) patients who did
not receive treatment based on a physician's
evaluation and their recommendations.
Details of those patients that went against
medical advice were classified into: (i) refusal
to receive treatment; (ii) uncooperative; (iii)
wanted to transfer to another hospital; (iv)
received outpatient treatment. Details of the
recommendations made after a physician's
evaluation were classified into: (i) no symp-
toms at ED arrival; (ii) intoxication without
trauma or medical problems; (iii) can be
treated by a primary care physician or at
another hospital; (iv) repeated visits with the
same symptoms. Patients were separated into
those who were under the influence of alcohol
versus those who were not.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the IBM SPSSÕ statistical package, version
20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) for
WindowsÕ. To investigate whether alcohol
intoxication affected the unnecessary EMS
transport or not, comparison of general,
clinical demographics, prehospital treat-
ment and reasons for lack of ED treatment
were performed between the non-intoxi-
cated and intoxicated group using 2-test,
Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test. A
P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Of the 26 069 total patients admitted to the
study hospital and the 2995 patients trans-
ported by EMS ambulances during the
study period, there were 212 run sheets
reviewed with 120 patients in the non-
intoxicated group and 92 in the intoxicated
group. The mean Æ SD age of the non-
intoxicated group was 40.9 Æ 21.9 years
compared with 45.7 Æ 12.4 years in the
intoxicated group (P ¼ 0.046) (Table 1).
Only two patients were of another ethnic
group other than South Korean and both of
them were in the intoxicated group. There
was a higher number of patients that used
EMS transportation without receiving ED
treatment near the study hospital (Figure 1).
The most frequently represented age group
was the fifties (23.3% [28 of 120]) in the non-
intoxicated group, and the forties and fifties
(32.6% [30 of 92] for each age group) in the
intoxicated group. The intoxicated group
had a higher percentage of males than the
non-intoxicated group (80.4% versus
51.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). When com-
paring the EMS use on weekends and holi-
days versus the weekdays between the two
groups, there was a higher percentage of
use during the weekends and holidays in
the intoxicated group compared with the
non-intoxicated group (P ¼ 0.033). Most
frequent time to call for EMS transportation
was from 09.00 h to 12.00 h for the non-
intoxicated group compared with 24.00 h to
03.00 h in the intoxicated group (Figure 2).
Elapsed time from EMS call to arrival of the
fire crew at the scene was less than 6 min and
to arrival at the ED was less than 26 min in
both groups. The most frequent occupation
if documented was being unemployed in the
non-intoxicated group, while office and
industrial work was the most frequent occu-
pation in the intoxicated group. Home was
the most common location of the call for
EMS in both groups. Calling for EMS from
a bar or restaurant was 14.1% (13 of 92) in
the intoxicated group.
Symptoms connected with a disease
occurred in 78 of 120 (65%) of the non-
intoxicated group, compared with 14 of 92
(15%) of the intoxicated group (P < 0.001)
Van Dillen and Kim 35
(Table 2). The most common cause of non-
disease symptoms in the intoxicated group
was assault (40%). Clinical demographics
including blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen
saturation, level of consciousness and pupil
light reflex were not found to be significantly
different between the two groups (Table 3).
There were no significant differences in most

receive treatment. In the non-intoxicated
group, the most common reason for lack
of ED treatment was that treatment could
take place on an outpatient basis (79 of 120;
65.8%), while in the intoxicated group, the
most frequent reason was the lack of patient
cooperation (48 of 92; 52.2%).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study that has investigated patients who get
transported by EMS to the ED, but then do
not receive treatment. There are several
studies that have investigated unnecessary
EMS transportation,4­16 but most of them
were based on the ED diagnosis or the

results of the ED treatment. One study
showed that the ED diagnosis was inappro-
priate as a criterion for evaluating the med-
ical necessity of EMS transport.12 By using
an ED diagnosis to identify patients for a
study of medically appropriate EMS use you
may be missing a significant amount of
important data. For example, some patients
leave prior to being seen by a physician and
therefore do not receive a diagnosis, while
others do not receive treatment due to their
personal choice to leave against medical
advice prior to full evaluation and testing.
This present study demonstrated that the
proportion of the patients who did not
receive ED treatment against medical
advice was 45% (96/212) overall. When
comparing those who were not intoxicated
with those who were intoxicated, it was 26%
versus 71%, respectively. In South Korea,
all intoxicated patients must not be dis-
charged if the attending physician believes
that the patient needs to be treated urgently.
However, if a patient appears to present
with intoxication alone or they have a minor
complaint that does not necessitate immedi-
ate treatment, then medical providers do not
need to enforce this rule. In South Korea, the
decision as to whether or not an intoxicated
patient needs to be treated in the ED is not
based on obtaining a blood alcohol level, but
on the physician's judgement. It should be
noted that when reviewing patients who did
not receive ED treatment due to a decision
they made against medical advice, in South
Korea, there is a general policy that they
would not be discharged if the physician feels
that the patient has an urgent need to be
treated. Therefore, all of the causes of no ED
treatment that were classified into the `against
medical advice' category in this study can be
defined as unnecessary EMS transport.
Drinking alcohol can cause medical prob-
lems as well as many socioeconomic
losses.15,17­19 Patients who are intoxicated
tend to use EMS transport and visit the ED
more frequently than the general
population.20,21 Many people utilized the
EMS resources unnecessarily in an intoxi-
cated state, with the intoxicated group
accounting for 43% of all patients (92/212)
in this study. Intoxicated patients who have
been assaulted have an even higher utiliza-
tion of EMS resources overall.22 Among
those patients considered to have symptoms
not associated with a disease process, 40%
in the intoxicated-group and 5% in the non-
intoxicated group presented as a result of
assault in the present study. This previous
evidence, along with the current findings,
lead us to believe that alcohol intoxication
and assault play a key role in the overuse of
EMS transport.20­22
Individual patients are not charged for
EMS transportation and prehospital treat-
ment provided by the local fire departments
in South Korea, as is the case in many other
countries.23,24 This may lead to excessive use
of EMS and unnecessary EMS transporta-
tion. In South Korea, the 119 dispatcher or
the emergency medical technician has the
right to refuse to transport a patient if they
believe that the patient does not need EMS
transportation, but in reality many pro-
viders are afraid to make the wrong decision
and EMS transportation is deployed. This is
one of the many obstacles in the attempt to
reduce unnecessary EMS transportation, as
well as the large proportion of the popula-
tion who consume alcohol in excess. Ideally
in the future, prehospital patients found to
be intoxicated alone without any medical or
traumatic problems may be considered not
suitable for EMS transportation if guide-
lines can be clearly outlined and EMS
providers are given appropriate training.
This present study had several limita-
tions. First, it was conducted retrospectively
in a single university academic hospital.
Therefore, the findings might not be gener-
alizable to a larger population. Secondly, the
data collected were based on fire fighters'
run sheets alone and not from a direct
interview with the patient in the ED. Also,
Van Dillen and Kim 41
the reasons for the lack of ED treatment was
investigated only by analysing the informa-
tion on the run sheets, therefore data may
have been misclassified. However, the study
attempted to decrease this error based
on prior experience of treating patients
in the study hospital. Direct follow-up inter-
views with the EMS provider who wrote
the report would have improved the accur-
acy of the data, but was not performed.
Thirdly, a review of all of the run sheets was
not performed, so the study was not able to
compare the characteristics of patients who
did receive ED treatment with those who did
not receive ED treatment. Larger prospect-
ive multi-centre studies that complement the
above findings will be helpful to evaluate the
accuracy of this present description of
unnecessary EMS transport.
In conclusion, this is the first study
to investigate the unnecessary utilization
of EMS transport based on patients who
did not receive treatment in the ED. The
intoxicated group was typically older males
who presented with symptoms not related to
a disease process when compared with those
in the non-intoxicated group. The most
frequent cause for not receiving ED treat-
ment in patients transported by EMS was
the physician's recommendation in the non-
intoxicated group and the patient's decision
to leave against medical advice in the
intoxicated group. This present study has
identified a need for education of the com-
munity surrounding Ulsan, South Korea.
Two programmes will need to be created
and delivered: (i) one should include educa-
tion surrounding alcohol abuse, covering
the dangers, and recognition and identifica-
tion of avenues for assistance in alcohol
control; and (ii) a second that is targeted at
the general population regarding the appro-
priate use of EMS and ED for medical care.
Applying a charge for EMS transportation
might need to be considered as a way to
reduce unnecessary EMS transportation in
South Korea. EMS systems outside of South
Korea might also be able to reduce unneces-
sary EMS transportation by adopting com-
prehensive guidelines for EMS transport
and having well-trained EMS personnel, as
well as by providing the aforementioned
public educational initiatives.
