Objectives. Older adults are increasingly likely to experience cohabitation, or living together unmarried in an intimate,
heterosexual union. In order to begin building a conceptual framework, we provide a descriptive portrait of older adult
cohabitors, emphasizing how they compare to older remarrieds and unpartnereds.
Methods. We used data from both Census 2000 and the 1998 Health and Retirement Study (HRS; Health and
Retirement Study, 1998) to estimate the size and composition of the cohabiting population aged 51 and older. Also, using
HRS data, we estimated multinomial logistic regression models to identify the correlates associated with cohabitation
and remarriage (vs being unpartnered) among women and men who were previously married.
Results. More than 1 million older adults, composing 4% of the unmarried population, currently cohabit. About 90% of
these individuals were previously married. We identify significant differences among cohabitors, remarrieds, and
unpartnereds across several dimensions, including sociodemographic characteristics, economic resources, physical health,
and social relationships. Cohabitors appear to be more disadvantaged than remarrieds, and this is especially evident
for women.
Discussion. Older cohabitors differ from individuals of other marital statuses, and therefore future work on marital
status should explicitly incorporate cohabitation.
THE PREVALENCE of heterosexual cohabitation in the
United States has increased enormously in recent decades.
The number of cohabiting couples grew by a factor of 10
between 1970 and 2000, from about 500,000 to around 5
million (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). Today, even though only
about 45% of all cohabiting unions eventuate in marriage, more
than half of all marriages are preceded by cohabitation
(Bumpass & Lu, 2000; Smock, 2000).
Most of the public attention surrounding cohabitation, as
well as most of the research, has focused on younger adults,
who usually cohabit as either a prelude or an alternative to first
marriage (Smock, 2000). However, cohabitation is actually
more common among the formerly married than the never
married (Bumpass & Lu, 2000). According to the 2000 Cencus,
of the roughly 10 million individuals currently cohabiting, more
than 1 million are older than age 50. It is clear that the rising
incidence of cohabitation crosses the age spectrum. Yet with
few exceptions (Brown, Bulanda, & Lee, 2005; Chevan, 1996;
De Jong Gierveld, 2004; Hatch, 1995; King & Scott, 2005), the
research literature has ignored the cohabitation experiences of
older adults (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). Research on the living
arrangements of older persons (e.g., Angel, Angel, McClellan,
& Markides, 1996; Wilmoth, 1998, 2001) has not considered
cohabitation.
The objective of this study was to use Census 2000 data and
national data from the 1998 Health and Retirement Study to
describe the characteristics of cohabitors aged 51 and older and
to show how these individuals compare with their contempo-
raries of different union statuses. As will be shown in the
Results section, nearly all older cohabitors have prior marital
experience; that is, they are divorced or widowed. Conse-
quently, we will emphasize comparisons across the previously
married: cohabitors, remarrieds, and unpartnereds. In other
words, to explore the significance of union type, we will
investigate how those who are formally remarried differ from
those who are cohabiting in informal unions. This research
contributes to an understanding of the antecedents and con-
sequences of cohabitation in the later stages of the life cycle,
issues that will become increasingly important to gerontologists
as the number of older cohabitors continues to rise.
Background
Several demographic processes are responsible for the
increase in cohabitation among middle-aged and older persons.
A major cause is simple cohort replacement. Substantial
increases in cohabitation among younger adults first occurred
in the baby boom cohorts. These people are now aging into
their later middle-age years, meaning that an increasing share
of older adults is likely to be favorably disposed towards
cohabitation (De Jong Gierveld, 2004). Moreover, divorce rates
have been relatively high among these cohorts, and remarriage
rates have decreased (Allen, Blieszner, & Roberto, 2000;
Cooney & Dunne, 2001), yielding more adults who are
unmarried and available for partnering. Cohabitation is also
more common among Blacks and Hispanics than among non-
Hispanic Whites (Raley, 1996; Wherry & Finegold, 2004),
and these groups are increasing as a proportion of the older
population. In consequence, a smaller fraction of the older
population will be married in coming decades, and a higher
proportion is likely to be cohabiting. Because the older
population is growing, this will produce an even greater
increase in the number of older cohabitors. There were just
more than 25 million Americans aged 55 and older in 1950; by
2000 this number had increased to nearly 60 million (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2002). Although growth in this age group has
been modest over the past decade, it is expected to accelerate

between 2010 and 2020 as baby boomers age into this group.
Indeed, Chevan's (1996) estimates of cohabitation among
persons aged 60 and older indicate that whereas fewer than
10,000 were cohabiting in 1960, more than 400,000 were
cohabiting by 1990. Brown and colleagues (2005) report that
more than 1.2 million persons aged 50 and older were
cohabiting in 2000; we calculate that more than 500,000 of
these were aged 60 and older.
Like the demographic trends, Americans' attitudes and
values regarding cohabitation are changing. Research shows
a dramatically increased tolerance of unmarried cohabitation
among both younger and older persons (Thornton & Young-
DeMarco, 2001), a trend that appears to comprise both cohort
and period effects. Well over a decade ago, Bulcroft and
Bulcroft (1991) reported that unmarried adults older than age
60 were as interested in cohabiting as in remarrying. These
trends point to an increasing diversity of living arrangements
among the older population that includes, notably, cohabitation
(Cooney & Dunne, 2001).
From a theoretical standpoint, cohabitation likely has
a unique meaning and plays a different role in the life course
of older adults than it does in that of younger adults (Chevan,
1996; Hatch, 1995; King & Scott, 2005). Research on dating
and remarriage among older adults suggests that theories
developed to explain these behaviors among young and middle-
aged adults are inadequate as they ignore the significance of
life-course stage in structuring opportunities and outcomes
(e.g., Bulcroft & Bulcroft, 1991; Bulcroft, Bulcroft, Hatch, &
Borgatta, 1989). Similarly, the motivations for cohabitation
among the older population are likely to differ from those of
young adults.
Several researchers assert that older adults, particularly
women, are not especially interested in remarriage (Bulcroft
& Bulcroft, 1991; Bulcroft et al., 1989; Chevan, 1996; Hatch,
1995; Talbott, 1998). Chevan (1996) maintains that the
disincentives for remarriage are greater among older adults,
who are especially likely to have economic resources whose
value may be undermined by remarriage. For instance, pro-
visions governing social security and pension receipt typi-
cally depend on one's marital status. Also, adult offspring may
encourage their parents to cohabit rather than to remarry in
order to protect their estates (i.e., the offspring's inheritances).
In summary, there are important demographic and theoretical
reasons for investigating the composition of the older adult
cohabiting population and for assessing how this group
compares with other union statuses. Despite the growth of the
older population, which is increasingly composed of unmar-
rieds who may enter into cohabitation, research on this topic
is scarce and dated. For instance, Chevan's (1996) study of
cohabitors older than age 60 relied on decennial census data
from 1960­1990, and Hatch's (1995) research on older
cohabitors used census data from 1980. Not only were these
analyses conducted at a time when cohabitation was much less
common, but both studies were also undermined by significant
data constraints, including the availability of only indirect
measures of cohabitation and a very narrow set of sociodemo-
graphic correlates to explore. Until 1990, cohabitation had to be
inferred from census data; respondents were not directly asked
whether they were currently involved in an intimate, hetero-
sexual, coresidential relationship (Casper & Cohen, 2000).
Moreover, Chevan's analyses compared cohabitors only to
other unmarrieds; marrieds were excluded. A few recent anal-
yses have incorporated cohabitation into studies of mental
health (Brown et al., 2005) and repartnering following marital
dissolution in The Netherlands (De Jong Gierveld, 2004)
among older adults, but these studies do not describe the older
adult cohabiting population and how it compares with other
union statuses.
The Present Study
The present study updates and extends the limited prior work
in this area by drawing on two data sources. We will construct
a detailed portrait of older cohabitors, providing explicit
comparisons to those in other union statuses (i.e., marriage,
remarriage, separation or divorce, widowhood, and the never-
married state). By examining older adults' characteristics across
these union statuses, we will document the composition of the
older adult cohabiting population and the extent to which these
older adults are similar to (and different from) those in other
union statuses. We will investigate multiple features of older
adults' lives according to union status, emphasizing factors
that were shown in prior research to be related to union
status among older adults: (a) demographic characteristics,
(b) economic resources, (c) physical health, and (d) social
relationships.
Demographic characteristics. --Union status is associated
with individual demographic characteristics, including gender,
age, and race. Union formation and dissolution processes differ
for men and women, particularly among the older population.
This is largely an artifact of the skewed sex ratio: Unmarried
women outnumber unmarried men by a ratio of 2.5:1 among
the 55 and older population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002: Table
48). This imbalance is exacerbated by gender-specific mate
selection strategies, whereby men tend to partner with younger
women whereas women often partner with older men. These
dynamics indicate that older men will be more likely to form
and maintain unions than women. Indeed, older cohabitors are
also disproportionately men. Men compose only about 25% of
the elderly unmarried population but account for nearly 60%
of cohabitors older than age 60 (Chevan, 1996). Among older
unmarrieds, age is negatively associated with cohabitation
(Chevan, 1996; De Jong Gierveld, 2004). In the general
population, cohabitation is especially common among African
Americans and Hispanics (Raley, 1996). As the older
population becomes more racially and ethnically diverse with
the changing composition of the American population and the
lengthening life expectancies of non-Whites, there is no reason
not to expect that African Americans and Hispanics will
continue to be more likely than Whites to cohabit. Among older
persons, Blacks are more likely to reside in cohabiting unions
than Whites, but Hispanics do not differ from Whites (Chevan,
1996; Hatch, 1995).
Economic resources. --Among younger persons (especially
men), economic stability is associated with marriage versus
cohabitation (Clarkberg, 1999; Oppenheimer, 2003; Smock,
Manning, & Porter, 2005; Xie, Raymo, Goyette, & Thornton,
2003). Cohabitation is particularly common among those with
lower levels of education, although its popularity has increased
BROWN ET AL.
S72
among individuals of all educational strata. Among older
persons, the association between education and cohabitation
is unclear. Hatch (1995) documents a negative relationship
between education and cohabitation, but Chevan (1996) finds no
significant association. In the present study, we tested whether
education was negatively related to cohabitation among older
adults, as it is for younger adults. Chevan's analysis of co-
habitation among older unmarried adults shows that poverty
is positively related to cohabitation. Nonetheless, he also finds
that labor force participation is positively associated with
cohabitation among men, perhaps because it serves as a proxy
for health and social integration. Or, economically active men
may be more attractive partners. In contrast, Hatch's analysis of
1980 Census data indicates that cohabiting older men are less
likely to be working and earn smaller incomes than either mar-
ried or single older men. Women exhibit a distinct pattern; co-
habitors have higher levels of employment than marrieds or
singles. Older cohabiting women report higher earnings than
single women but lower earnings than married women. Addi-
tional economic factors associated with cohabitation among
older adults include renting (vs owning) a home and receipt of
entitlement income (Hatch, 1995).
Physical health. --Despite being younger, on average, than
marrieds, cohabitors report poorer physical health (Brown et al.,
2005). Relative to marriage, cohabitation may be selective of
individuals in worse health. Those in poor health may be less
attractive as potential spouses, leaving these less healthy
individuals at risk of a cohabiting union, which typically
requires a weaker commitment from a partner. Among older
men, poor health is positively related to cohabitation versus
being single (Hatch, 1995), perhaps because older men in ill
health are seeking support. This finding is consistent with
Talbott's (1998) assertion that older women are reluctant to
assume the burden of caregiving that may follow from
remarriage at older ages, particularly when men's tradi-
tional familial obligation of economic provision ends in
old age. Existing studies of caregiving, even those focused
on ethnic minorities among whom cohabitation is more
common, essentially ignore cohabitation (e.g., Pinquart &
Sorenson, 2005).
Social relationships. --There are competing hypotheses
regarding the association between social relationships and
cohabitation among older adults (Hatch, 1995; Talbott, 1998).
The compensatory hypothesis suggests that those individuals
who do not receive adequate support from friends and family
members will be especially motivated to form a union to
achieve support through an intimate partner. Alternatively, the
complementary hypothesis states that those individuals who
enjoy the highest levels of social interaction with friends and
family will be most interested in--and effective at--forming an
intimate partnership, which these individuals view as offering
unique, nonoverlapping forms of support. Widows with close
friends are more interested than those without close friends
in forming a new partnership, supporting the complementary
approach to social relationships (Talbott, 1998). Additional
support for this hypothesis comes from a study of dating among
older unmarrieds that documents a positive relationship
between organizational participation and dating (Bulcroft &
Bulcroft, 1991). To the extent that social relationships enhance
individual well-being and promote social integration, we
expected that they would be positively associated with
cohabitation. Religious commitment and affliliation are nega-
tively associated with cohabitation not only because some
religions frown upon living together outside of formal
marriage, but also because religious persons tend to espouse
more traditional, conservative family attitudes that are dis-
approving of cohabitation (Clarkberg, Stolzenberg, & Waite,
1995; Thornton, Axinn, & Hill, 1992). One study of
repartnering among older adults conceptualized the absence
of religious affiliation as an indicator of individualism, which
was positively associated with forming a cohabiting union (De
Jong Gierveld, 2004). Older adults' relationships with their
children may influence their own relationship trajectories. Close
relationships with children may weaken an older adult's interest
in forming a cohabiting (or marital) union. Or, children may
pressure parents to avoid the legal complexities that would
accompany remarriage and may suggest cohabitation as an
alternative (Bulcroft & Bulcroft, 1991; Chevan, 1996; Hatch,
1995). Indeed, Hatch contends that children actively discourage
their widowed mothers from remarrying, and De Jong Gierveld
posits that the parent­child relationship weakens following
repartnering. Widowed older women with children are less
likely than their childless counterparts to remarry, but chil-
dren are not associated with older men's remarriage patterns
(Wu, 1995).
In summary, we expect cohabitors, remarrieds, and those
who were previously married but are now unpartnered (i.e., the
divorced and widowed) to differ in terms of demographic
characteristics, economic resources, physical health, and social
relationships. Additionally, these union status differences are
likely to be distinct for men and women. We extend prior work
on remarriage following divorce or widowhood by including
cohabitation as a competing risk.
METHODS
We used two sources of data. Initially, we drew on the
Census 2000 Public-Use Microdata Samples 5% sample to
document the prevalence of cohabitation among older adults by
age and union status. This basic census information provided
a point of comparison for our findings from the main source of
data we employed: the 1998 Health and Retirement Study
(HRS; Health and Retirement Study, 1998). Designed to
examine health and retirement decision making as well as how
older adults and their families respond to declining health in
later life, the HRS is a nationally representative sample
comprising 21,384 noninstitutionalized persons born in 1947
and earlier. Thus, at the time of the 1998 interview, respondents
were as young as 51 years old.
Of the 21,384 HRS respondents, 33 were eliminated from
our sample because we were unable to determine their current
marital status. Another 21 respondents were eliminated because
they reported being in same-sex partnerships (although sub-
stantively of interest, the small number of cases prohibits
meaningful analysis of this group). Finally, an additional 681
respondents were excluded because they did not have a sample
weight (typically because they were institutionalized). We also
limited our sample to individuals aged 51 and older, which
COHABITATION AMONG OLDER ADULTS S73
resulted in the loss of an additional 922 respondents (i.e.,
younger spouses or partners of primary respondents), for a final
sample size of 19,727.
Measures
Union status. --HRS respondents reported their union status
at the time of interview. Approximately 2.2% of the sample was
cohabiting, yielding 437 cohabitors for analysis. About 48.7%
of the respondents (n ¼ 9,617) were in first marriages, 19.8%
(n ¼ 3,899) were widowed, 16.5% (n ¼ 3,255) were in
remarriages, 9.9% (n ¼ 1,948) were separated or divorced, and
the remaining 2.9% (n ¼ 571) had never married.
Demographic characteristics. --Gender was a dichotomous
variable (1 ¼ women). Race/ethnicity was composed of four
dummy variables: non-Hispanic White (reference), non-
Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other race. Age
was coded in years. Previously widowed (a dummy variable
coded 1 for those whose marriage ended through death of the
spouse and 0 for those whose marriage ended in divorce) was
controlled for in the analyses that were restricted to the
previously married.
Economic resources. --Several indicators of respondents'
economic resources were included. Education was coded in
years, ranging from 0 (no formal education) to 17 (post-college;
i.e., more than 17 years of education). Household income was
a constructed measure in the HRS data set that incorporated
bracketed income responses using sophisticated imputation
techniques. It was logged to minimize the effects of skewness.
A dichotomous measure indicated whether the respondent
owned his/her home (1 ¼ yes). Employment status was dummy
coded full-time employment (reference), part-time employ-
ment, unemployed, and not working. Retirement status in-
dicated whether the respondent was retired (1 ¼ yes). This
measure was distinct from the employment status variable
because some respondents were technically retired but working
in a different job. We also included measures to tap receipt
of Social Security and a pension (1 ¼ yes). Health insurance
coverage is gauged by four mutually exclusive dummy
variables: private insurance (reference), Medicare, other in-
surance (e.g., Medicaid), and no insurance.
Physical health. --The activity of daily living (ADL)
measure is a scale composed of the responses to 11 items
asking the respondent whether, because of health problems, he
or she has any difficulty with various ADLs (e.g., walking
several blocks, sitting for about two hours, picking up a dime
from a table). For each question, answers of yes are coded 1 and
answers of no are coded 0. Responses are then added together
to form the scale. Alcohol measured whether and how much the
respondent drank. Those who indicated that they did not drink
or have never drunk alcohol (more than 50% of the sample)
were coded 1; those who responded that they drank alcohol but
less than once a week were coded 2; those who responded that
they drank alcohol at least once a week but not daily were
coded 3; and those who reported drinking alcohol every day
were coded 4.
Social relationships. --Social relationships were gauged by
several measures. Neighborhood friends was coded 1 if the
respondent reported having good friends living in the neighbor-
hood and 0 otherwise. Relatives in the neighborhood was coded
1 if the respondent reported at least one relative residing in their
neighborhood and 0 otherwise. (The term neighborhood is not
explicitly defined by the HRS.) Religiosity is a measure of the
reported significance of religion in the respondent's life,
ranging from 1 ¼ not too important to 3 ¼ very important.
Children is coded 1 if the respondent reported having at least
one living biological child and 0 otherwise.
Analytic Strategy
We began by establishing the size and marital status
distribution of the older adult cohabiting population using the
Census 2000 data. These data provide a benchmark against
which to compare the figures we obtained from the 1998 HRS.
Next, we employed the HRS to compare older adults across six
union statuses in terms of several sets of characteristics that are
related to union status, including demographic characteristics,
economic resources, physical health, and social relationships.
Because roughly 90% of HRS cohabitors were previously
married (i.e., had been divorced or widowed), the most
appropriate comparison group for ascertaining the significance
of union type was not individuals in marriages but rather those
in remarriages. Previously published literature (e.g., Bulcroft
et al., 1989; Burch 1990; Talbott 1998) has examined middle-
aged and older adults' decisions to remarry following divorce
or the death of a spouse, and we extended this line of inquiry by
treating cohabitation and remarriage as competing risks. Thus,
our final set of analyses was restricted to those who were
previously married. Detailed comparisons by union type (i.e.,
cohabitation vs remarriage) were examined separately for
women and men. We estimated multinomial logistic regression
models of the competing risks of being in either a cohabiting
union or remarriage (vs being unpartnered; i.e., being divorced
or widowed) separately for women and men. Our objective is
to describe the population of older cohabitors, so we are less
concerned about causal order here; the set of independent
variables likely includes both antecedents and consequences of
union type. This analysis shows most clearly how older,
previously married persons who cohabit differ from those who
are remarried or unpartnered. These are critical comparisons
because it is unclear whether cohabitation is better conceptu-
alized as an alternative to marriage or to remaining unpartnered
among older persons who have experienced divorce or
widowhood. The complex sample design of the HRS means
that the sample is not self-weighting. Thus, standard errors need
to be adjusted to correct for design effects. Both descriptive and
multivariate analyses were conducted in Stata (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX) using the survey procedure to correct for
the complex sample design.
RESULTS
According to Census 2000 data, 1,088,428 persons aged 51
and older are currently cohabiting (, 2% of this age group; see
Table 1). Age is negatively associated with cohabitation; most
of these cohabitors (n ¼ 676,782) are between the ages of 51
BROWN ET AL.
S74
and 59. Among those who are at risk of cohabiting (i.e., the
unmarried), 4% are involved in cohabiting relationships. For
unmarrieds aged 51­59, the number of cohabitors is nearly 9%.
A majority of older cohabitors are divorced or separated (71%),
followed by widowed (18%), and never married (11%).
HRS data show slightly higher percentages of older adults
cohabiting. Among respondents aged 51 and older, 2% (n ¼
437) are currently cohabiting. As in the census data, younger
persons are more likely to cohabit. Among the unmarried,
nearly 10% of those aged 51­59 are cohabiting; this decreases
about 7% of those 60­69 and nearly 2% of those 70 and older.
This is consistent with the prediction that the number of older
cohabitors will increase via the process of cohort replacement.
As is also shown by the census data, most HRS cohabitors are
divorced or separated (63%), followed by widowed (23%), and
never married (12%; these percentages do not equal 100%
because marital status is indeterminable for 2% of the sample).
Table 2 shows the weighted means of the variables by union
status. As anticipated, older adult cohabitors are less likely than
first marrieds and remarrieds to be White and are more likely
to be Black. Cohabitors are also younger, on average, than all
other groups except the divorced. Although cohabitors have
a greater likelihood of being employed full time, the household
incomes of older cohabitors, first marrieds, and remarrieds
do not differ significantly. Also, older cohabitors are less likely
than either group of marrieds to own a house or to have health
insurance. About 13% of cohabitors have no health insurance,
and another 25% rely solely on Medicare. Although cohabitors,
first marrieds, and remarrieds experience similar levels of
ADLs (levels that are lower than those reported by divorced,
widowed, and never marrieds), cohabitors report significantly
higher average levels of alcohol consumption than any other
group. In terms of social relationships, cohabitors do not fare
especially well. They are least likely of any group to report
having friends or relatives in the neighborhood (although they
do not differ from the divorced in their reports of having friends
or from remarrieds in their reports of relatives nearby). This
suggests that cohabitors are more isolated socially. Cohabitors
also report lower levels of religiosity than any other union
status group. Not surprisingly, although cohabitors are slightly
less likely than both groups of married persons to have living
children they are much more likely than the never married to
have children. Taken together, cohabitors appear most similar
to the divorced group, which is consistent with our decision
to emphasize here comparisons among those who had been
previously married.
The remaining analyses focus on cohabitors, remarrieds, and
unpartnereds who are divorced or widowed. Table 3 compares
these three groups separately by gender. Women are much
more likely to be unpartnered (73%) than are men (41%). Men
are twice as likely as women to be cohabiting (6% vs 3%) or
remarried (53% vs 24%). Among both women and men,
cohabitors are more likely than remarrieds but less likely than
unpartnereds to be previously widowed. Consistent with the
pattern shown for the full sample, remarrieds are more likely
than cohabitors to be White and older, regardless of gender.
The race/ethnic composition of cohabitors and unpartnereds is
similar, although the former are younger, on average, than
the latter. Among women, remarrieds report higher household
incomes, on average, than cohabitors, who in turn report higher
incomes than unpartnereds. Among men, the household
incomes of cohabitors and remarrieds do not differ, but
cohabitors report higher incomes than unpartnereds. Remarried
and unpartnered women are less likely than cohabiting women
to be employed full time. Among men, employment patterns
are similar for remarrieds and cohabitors, but unpartnereds are
less likely than cohabitors to work full or part time. Cohabiting
women are most likely to be without health insurance (16%),
but there are no union status differences among men. Women
report more ADLs than men, and unpartnereds report the
highest levels of ADLs. Alcohol consumption is higher among
men than women; it is also higher among cohabitors than
any other group. Cohabitors tend to score lower than either
remarrieds or unpartnereds on the measures of social relation-
ships, although reports of children are uniformly high across
union status and gender. Among cohabitors, women have
higher levels of religiosity than men, on average.
Table 4 shows the multinomial logistic regression models
predicting cohabitation versus remarriage among those who
have been previously married, estimated separately for women
and men. The reference category for these comparisons is the
unpartnered (i.e., the widowed and divorced). The patterns of
association between demographic characteristics and cohabita-
tion versus remarriage are similar for men and women. Those
who were widowed are less likely than those who were
divorced to be cohabiting or remarried. Older Blacks are less
likely than Whites to be remarried, but the probability of being
in a cohabiting union is not associated with race/ethnicity. Age
is negatively related to both cohabiting and being remarried.
In contrast, economic resources appear to be related quite
differently to women's and men's union type. Education is
negatively associated with both cohabitation and remarriage
among women, but it is not significantly related to union type
among men. Cohabiting and remarried women, but not men,
are more likely than the unpartnered to be unemployed. Among
women, part-time employment and not working are more
common among the remarried, whereas being retired is
negatively associated with remarriage. None of these factors
is associated with cohabitation among women, nor are they

COHABITATION AMONG OLDER ADULTS S75
related to men's union type. Women without health insurance
are more likely to be cohabiting, whereas, among men, the
absence of health insurance is unrelated to union type. Alcohol
consumption is positively related to cohabitation among
women, but it is not associated with men's union status.
Neither the presence of friends nor of relatives in the
neighborhood is associated with cohabitation or remarriage.
Among women, religiosity is negatively associated with
cohabitation, whereas among men, it is positively related to
remarriage. The presence of children is positively associated
with cohabitation and remarriage among men and with
remarriage among women.
DISCUSSION
The prevalence of cohabitation has grown dramatically in
recent decades, and this growth has been evident across all age
groups (Bumpass & Lu, 2000; Chevan, 1996). Nonetheless, the
cohabitation experiences of older adults have been largely
overlooked (Cooney & Dunne, 2001). Combining data from
Census 2000 and the 1998 HRS, we constructed a national
portrait of older adult cohabitors that reveals both the
characteristics of this group and how this group compares
with older adults in other union statuses.
The data reported here suggest that, in terms of social and
demographic characteristics, older cohabitors and remarried
persons differ in many of the same ways that younger
cohabitors and married persons do. Blacks are less likely to
be married. Cohabitors (particularly women) have lower
incomes and are less likely to own their homes than are
remarried persons. They are also more likely than remarried to
use alcohol. Finally, they score lower than older remarrieds on
most of the measures of social relationships used in this
study, including religiosity and having friends and relatives
who live nearby.
In some respects, cohabitors compare favorably to the
unpartnered. Cohabitors' household incomes are higher, and
they are more likely to be employed full time and to have
private health insurance than are the unpartnered. On the other
hand, cohabitors (especially women) are more likely than the
unpartnered to have no health insurance at all. Cohabitors also
score lower than the unpartnered on all of the measures of
social relationships used in this study, except having children.
The picture that emerges from these comparisons is one of
fairly systematic disadvantage among older cohabitors, espe-
cially in comparison to their remarried counterparts. As is the
case among younger persons (Clarkberg, 1999; Oppenheimer,
2003; Smock, 2000; Smock et al., 2005), cohabitation may be
chosen by individuals whose economic circumstances make
marriage more risky. This raises the question of whether
cohabitation has similar consequences to remarriage for older

persons. Studies show, for example, that older married persons
(especially men) are more likely than unmarried persons to
engage in healthy behaviors (Schone & Weinick, 1998);
researchers do not know yet whether the same is true of
cohabitors.
The disadvantage associated with cohabitation appears
especially pronounced among women, who may derive fewer
benefits than men do from cohabitation. Among men,
cohabitors are more likely than unpartnereds to own a home;
among women, cohabitors and unpartnereds do not differ in
this respect. Among women, the proportion of cohabitors with
no health insurance is 3 times larger than that of remarrieds and
unpartnereds; among men, there are no significant union status
differences in this respect. Although cohabiting and remarried
men enjoy statistically similar high household incomes,
cohabiting women report an average household income of
roughly two thirds that of remarried women. It is therefore not
surprising that more cohabiting women than either remarried or
unpartnered women are employed full time (among men,
cohabitors and remarrieds are equally likely to work full time).
Taken together, our findings indicate that union status may be
more consequential for women than men. Simply put, there are
fewer union status differences among men than among women.
As researchers continue to explore the gendered consequences
of remarriage, divorce, and widowhood, our results reveal the
importance of incorporating cohabitation into this research, too.
There are still many unknowns about later life cohabitation.
Cohabitation, of course, entails less commitment than remar-
riage. Does this lesser commitment allow cohabiting persons to
``bail out'' when their partners become infirm or disabled, and
do they take advantage of this possibility? Do older cohabitors
share their resources in the same ways that married couples do,
or do they hoard their own because the union may be fragile?
This is important because cohabitors tend to have fewer
resources per capita than remarried persons. To the extent that
cohabitation is an alternative to remaining unpartnered, it may
be a key source of support for older persons. Similar to
marrieds, cohabitors presumably enjoy access to a regular sex
partner. To the extent that cohabitation is a substitute for
remarriage among the divorced and widowed, it may make
older adults' lives less secure and their support networks
more vulnerable to disruption.
In order to fully ascertain the implications of cohabitation for
policy and practice, researchers need answers to at least some of

COHABITATION AMONG OLDER ADULTS S77
these questions. For some older persons, a cohabiting partner
may be a critical resource, providing help in times of need,
material support that alleviates the strains of poverty, and
emotional support to assuage loneliness. Or the partner may
disappear just when the need for support is greatest. Until
researchers know more about what motivates older persons to
cohabit, as well as the factors that predict entry into and exit
from cohabitation, it is difficult to accurately assess the
implications of cohabitation.
As the older adult population continues to grow, and
especially as the baby boomers age into this group, it becomes
increasingly important that researchers assess the ramifications
of cohabitation among older adults. Baby boomers were the
first generation to cohabit in significant numbers as young
adults, and consequently society can anticipate an increase in
older adult cohabitation as the boomers age into older
adulthood. Unfortunately, baby boomers are not represented
in the 1998 HRS, which is a sample of persons born in 1947
and earlier. Early boomers (those born in 1948­1953) will be
folded into the 2004 panel of the HRS.
The present study indicates that cohabitation among older
adults is more common than researchers realized and is likely to
increase in the future. We are not alone in this prediction; others
researchers have noted that a declining share of older adults will
be married in the coming decades, and thus a larger share will be
at risk for cohabitation (e.g., Allen et al., 2000; Cooney &
Dunne, 2001; De Jong Gierveld, 2004). The determinants of the
formation and dissolution of older adult cohabiting relationships
await future research. In the meantime, the present analyses
demonstrate that cohabitors are a distinct group, comparable
neither to remarrieds nor to other unmarrieds. As described in
this article, the ramifications of this emerging relationship form
for the well-being of older adults are not entirely clear. More-
over, because we were not able to ascertain whether older adult
cohabitors weighed the decision to cohabit against remaining
unpartnered or getting remarried, we compared cohabitors to
both of these groups. Whether cohabitation typically operates as
an alternative to singlehood or as a substitute for marriage is not
readily apparent, because cohabitors--especially women--are
unlike those in other union statuses across several key
dimensions, including several indicators of economic resources
and social relationships. For this reason, future gerontological
research would benefit from expanding the formulation of
marital status to include cohabitation so that researchers can
begin to uncover the implications of cohabitation for the health
and well-being of older adults.
