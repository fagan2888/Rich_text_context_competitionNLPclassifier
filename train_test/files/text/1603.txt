institutionalized adults aged 20 years.
Logistic regression was used to estimate the
odds of an `abnormal' PSA level (4.0 or
2.5 ng/mL) based on BMI categories of
normal (18.5­24.9 kg/m2), overweight
(25­29.9) and obese (30­39.9) in men who
were eligible for prostate-cancer screening
with serum total PSA tests (age 40­75 years,
BMI 18.5­39.9 kg/m2, PSA <20 ng/mL).
RESULTS
In all, 3152 participants with no known
prostate cancer, representing 46 million
American men, were eligible for prostate-
cancer screening. After controlling for age
and race, there was a statistically significant
trend of a lower likelihood of having a serum
total PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL with increased
BMI. When men were stratified by race, this
effect was apparent only in white non-
Hispanic men, with obese men in this group
having a 46% lower likelihood of having an
`abnormal' PSA level (odds ratio 0.54, 95%
confidence interval 0.31­0.91; P = 0.024)
than those with a normal BMI. There was no
observable trend in either African-American
or Hispanic men. In addition, there was no
observable trend with a serum total PSA
threshold of 2.5 ng/mL, regardless of race.
CONCLUSIONS
Obese white non-Hispanic men are about
half as likely as those with a normal BMI to
have a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL. These results
might affect prostate-cancer screening with
serum total PSA. Further studies are needed
to better define the association of BMI and
PSA in racial minority subgroups.

OBJECTIVE
To determine if lower serum total prostate
specific antigen (PSA) levels in obese
American men affect prostate-cancer
screening results, as an increased body mass
index (BMI) is inversely associated with PSA
level, but the effect of this association on
PSA screening results for prostate cancer is
unknown.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
We analysed the most recent National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES 2001­2002, 2003­2004, and
2005­2006), a nationally representative
cross-sectional sample of non-
INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the most common solid
tumour and the second leading cause of
cancer death in American men. In the USA in
2008, 186 320 men were diagnosed with
prostate cancer and 28 660 men died from
the disease [1]. The incidence of screen-
detected prostate cancer has increased
substantially over the past two decades, while
there has been a more gradual decrease in the
number of deaths from the disease. This
increased detection reflects not only an
ageing population, but also the use of more
sensitive screening techniques such as serum
PSA testing [2].
Screening for prostate cancer using PSA is
now commonplace in the USA [3]. Consequent
to its widespread use, PSA has increased the
detection rate of clinically localized prostate
cancer by almost twice compared to the use of
a DRE alone [4]. As of 2002,>75% of men aged
>50 years in the USA had undergone a PSA
test [3]. In general, a serum total PSA level
of 4.0 ng/mL is used as a criterion for
proceeding to prostate biopsy [5].
Obesity is now viewed as a major health
concern in the USA and has been linked to
various chronic diseases, including cancer
[6,7]. Many studies have examined the
association between obesity and the
development of prostate cancer. While some
of these studies found a positive association
[8­11], others reported little or no association
[12]. In addition, studies have shown obesity
to be related to a higher Gleason grade, more
advanced stage, and higher mortality rate
from prostate cancer [9­11,13,14].
Although obesity might or might not be a
causative factor in the development of
prostate cancer, it could alter the incidence of
prostate cancer through its effect on the
detection of the disease, i.e. through its
influence on serum total PSA levels. Several
previous studies described an inverse
relationship between serum total PSA level
and body mass index (BMI) [15­18]. An
inverse association could result in fewer
screen-detected cancers, causing a decrease
in the observed incidence of prostate cancer
in obese men. Furthermore, delayed detection
of prostate cancer in obese men could explain
the observed association between obesity and
worse oncological outcome. The objective of

the present study was to describe the
association between obesity and PSA
screening results in the population of men in
the USA.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
We used data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
a programme of the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention National Center for
Health Statistics, conducted over the years
2001­2002, 2003­2004, and 2005­2006.
NHANES is a cross-sectional survey of the USA
population; 5000 non-institutionalized
civilians participate each year. The specific
details of data collection and analysis are
summarized elsewhere [19]. Briefly, NHANES
uses a complex probability sampling design in
identifying counties, clusters of households,
and individuals or multiple individuals within
households.Onceindividualsareselected,they
undergo detailed interviews as well as a
physical and laboratory examinations. The
sampling design and subsequent weighting of
collected data allow results to be extrapolated
to the USA population. Although only 5000
participants are examined each year, vital and
health statistics for a significant proportion of
Americans are obtained, thereby influencing
subsequentpublichealthpolicy.Allprocedures
performed through NHANES are approved
through the National Center for Health
Statistics institutional review board, and
informed written consent obtained from each
participant.
Men aged 40 years were eligible to have a
serum PSA test; excluded from serum PSA
testing were men who voluntarily refused,
had a history of prostate cancer, had active
infection or inflammation of the prostate, had
undergone a DRE in the previous 7 days, or
had undergone a cystoscopy or prostate
needle biopsy within a month of testing.
Collection and storage procedures for serum
PSA samples in NHANES are documented
elsewhere [19].
BMI was determined by the standard method
(kg/m2) and subjects classified as normal
(18.5­24.9), overweight (25.0­29.9) or obese
(30.0­39.9). For this analysis, individuals with
a BMI of <18.5 or 40.0 kg/m2 were excluded
under the assumption that men at these
extremes of BMI are less likely to be
candidates for screening due to comorbid
medical conditions. In addition, due to the
fewer subjects and therefore a potential loss
of power, individuals with a BMI of
30.0­39.9 kg/m2 were grouped together
as `obese' rather than subdivided into a BMI
of 30.0­34.9 and 35.0­39.9 kg/m2.
For our analyses, only men aged 40­75 years
were included, as this age range represents
the generally accepted age range for
prostate-cancer screening. Based on self-
reported race, subjects were classified as
white non-Hispanic, African-American,
Hispanic, or other. Individuals with a PSA level
of 20.0 ng/mL were excluded, under the
assumption they were likely to have prostate
cancer detectable by a DRE.
To confirm the inverse relationship between
PSA and BMI in the NHANES data,
multivariate linear regression analyses were
used, modelling BMI as a continuous variable
and controlling for race and age at the time
of the examination. Serum total PSA values
were log-transformed before analyses to
approximate a normal distribution. In
addition, to examine the relationship between
BMI and serum free PSA level (after log-
transformation) or PSA ratio, multivariate
linear regression analysis was used, applied to
the subset of men with a serum total PSA level
of 4.0­10.0 ng/mL. Serum free PSA levels and
PSA ratios were available for all men who had
a serum total PSA test in our study.
Two separate PSA thresholds, of 2.5 and
4.0 ng/mL, were used to categorize PSA values
as `normal' or `abnormal' for this analysis. To
describe the association between obesity and
the likelihood of a serum total PSA level of
2.5 or 4.0 ng/mL, logistic regression analyses
were used after dichotomizing men as having
a PSA level of 2.5 or 4.0 ng/mL, respectively.
The odds of having an `abnormal' PSA for each
threshold were then calculated, using men
with a normal BMI as the reference group.
To account for the survey sampling design,
sampling weights and Taylor series
linearization were used to generate point
estimates and SEs for both the linear and
logistic regression models, using Stata 10.1
(Stata Corp., College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
In all, there were 4022 men aged 40­80 years,
representing 53 400 000 American men;
3152 men remained after applying the
inclusion criteria (excluded were 12 men for a
PSA level of 20 ng/mL, 552 for age
76 years, 189 for BMI of 40, 29 for a BMI of
<18.5; 88 men met more than one exclusion
criteria). The final study group represented
46 300 000 American men. Table 1 gives

represented population after applying
sampling weights, and the mean PSA level for
each subgroup. In all, 459 and 208 men had a
serum total PSA level of 2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL,
respectively. After controlling for race and age
at the time of examination, there was a 1.09%
decrease (95% CI, -1.65 to -0.52; P < 0.001)
in total serum PSA level for each one unit
increase in BMI. These results are consistent
with previous studies [16,17].
Because results appeared to vary by race, we
chose to present stratum-specific estimates
for each racial group. Therefore, results of the
logistic regression analysis are presented
stratified by race. Only white non-Hispanic
men showed a significant association
between serum PSA level and BMI. For white
non-Hispanic men, there was, on average, a
1.39% decrease (95% CI -2.07 to -0.71;
P < 0.001) in total serum PSA level for each
one unit increase in BMI. There was no
significant association between BMI and total
serum PSA level in either the African-
American or Hispanic subgroup. There was no
significant association between BMI and free
PSA or PSA ratio in those men with a serum
total PSA level of 4.0­10.0 ng/mL.
Table 2 gives the results from the logistic
regression analysis that defined an elevated
PSA level as a total serum PSA level of
4.0 ng/mL. Race classified as `other' is not
presented separately because there were no
BMI strata with a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL,
making it impossible to calculate an odds
ratio. Obese white non-Hispanic men were
46% less likely to have an `abnormal' PSA level
than men of normal BMI (odds ratio 0.54,
95% CI 0.31­0.92; P = 0.024). There was no
consistent statistically significant trend
among men classified as African American or
Hispanic (Table 2).
Table 2 also gives the results from a logistic
regression analysis that defined an elevated
PSA as a total serum PSA level of 2.5 ng/mL;
there was no significant association between
BMI and the odds of a positive screening test
in any of the racial groups.
DISCUSSION
The American Cancer Society and the AUA
currently recommend annual screening with
a DRE and serum PSA test for men aged
50­80 years and who have a life-expectancy
of 10 years. Earlier screening is
recommended for African-American men and
those with a strong family history of prostate
cancer [20,21]. Although there is no level 1
evidence supporting the use of PSA screening,
such screening is widespread and the vast
majority of incident cases of prostate cancer
are detected by PSA testing in the USA [3,4].
Obesity is highly prevalent in the USA;
currently 127 million adults are overweight
(BMI 25.0­29.9 kg/m2), 60 million are obese
(30.0­40.0 kg/m2) and 9 million are morbidly
obese (BMI >40.0 kg/m2). These numbers
are increasing, as 4.7% of adults are now
morbidly obese, compared with 2.9% in
1994 [22]. Obesity is associated with the
development of several diseases, including
cancer. At least two large studies have shown
an inverse relationship between BMI and the
risk of prostate cancer [23,24], and at least
one study has shown an inverse relationship
between BMI and the development of low-
grade (Gleason score <7) prostate cancer [25].
Several other studies have reported a greater
risk of high-grade (Gleason score of 7)
disease [8,10,25,26], increased biochemical
recurrence after radical prostatectomy [9,26],
and mortality from prostate cancer [6,14] in
obese men.
To our knowledge, the present is the first
study to quantify the potential effect of the
inverse association between serum total PSA
level and BMI on prostate cancer screening in
the general USA population. Using data
representative of the larger population of
men in the USA, our results show that the
inverse relationship between PSA and BMI has
the potential to influence PSA screening
results. Using a threshold of 4.0 ng/mL, we
found that obese white non-Hispanic men
had a significantly decreased odds (46%) of
having an abnormal PSA test than those with
a normal BMI. It was recently reported that a
significant number of men with a PSA level of
<4.0 ng/mL harbour prostate cancer [27].
Because of this, some experts have
recommended that a lower threshold be
considered as abnormal, with 2.5 ng/mL being
a common suggestion [28]. When we
considered this threshold, there was no longer
an observable trend of decreasing PSA level
with increased BMI, nor were there significant
point estimates of risk of an `abnormal' PSA
among BMI groups.
Our study failed to show an inverse
relationship between serum total PSA level

and BMI in African-American or Hispanic
men. In fact, although not statistically
significant, point estimates of risk of an
`abnormal' PSA level were higher in both
groups. Furthermore, there was no observable
trend of a PSA­BMI association in either
African-American or Hispanic men. These
observations, although interesting, might be
due to a lack of power. Werny et al. [16], when
examining the association between PSA and
several anthropometric variables using data
from NHANES 2001­2004, found an inverse
BMI-PSA relationship in all men examined, as
well as white non-Hispanic men, after racial
stratification. This is consistent with our
findings when using two additional years of
data (NHANES 2005­2006). However, of
interest, the study by Werny et al. also
reported an inverse BMI-PSA relationship in
Mexican-American men, which we did not
observe even including these additional data.
However, other studies support that there is
an inverse association regardless of race. In
particular, Price et al. [29], using a multiethnic
cohort of 535 men, reported an inverse
association between BMI and serum total PSA
level. Although those authors did not stratify
results based on race, it is likely that the BMI-
PSA relationship in African-American men
mirrored that of the total population, as this
group comprised 55% of the study cohort.
Although most of the previous studies that
reported an inverse BMI-PSA relationship
controlled for race in their analyses, few
assessed racial subgroups separately. This lack
of stratification, especially in the face of
possible effect-modification, could not only
lead to overlooking a lack of an association in
certain racial groups if one should exist, but
also could result in `dampening' of the PSA-
BMI relationship in white non-Hispanic men.
Based on these inconsistencies, further study
is needed to better define the relationship
between PSA and BMI in racial subgroups.
Although one distinct advantage of using
NHANES is that over-sampling of minority
groups is used in data collection and analysis,
the statistical power to detect an association
between PSA and obesity in racial minority
subgroups is limited. Nonetheless, the current
study is based on reliable data from NHANES
2001­2006, and these data have been used in
many studies examining disease risk factors
and health behaviours in the USA [30].
NHANES, to our knowledge, is the only source
available to evaluate serum PSA level at the
USA population level, and is an ideal data
source for examining questions that have
potential nationwide public health
significance, as the results are directly
applicable to the population of the USA.
Given the prevalence of obesity and the
frequency of PSA screening in the USA,
our findings have potential public health
implications. If obese men with prostate
cancer are more likely to have an initial
`normal' PSA test, then their tumours are
more likely to be detected later in the disease
course. This possibility is compatible with
previous studies that described worse tumour
features and oncological outcomes in obese
men with prostate cancer [9­11,13,14]. As
most prostate cancer is currently screen-
detected through the use of PSA tests, our
findings are also compatible with those of
previous studies that observed a lower overall
incidence of prostate cancer in obese men. If
PSA screening is to be applied with equal
effect to men with differing BMI, perhaps PSA
should be corrected for BMI, similar to how
PSA is interpreted differently based on patient
age, or how it is corrected (by doubling the
measured value) in men who chronically use
5-reductase inhibitors for symptomatic
BPH.
Although our results suggest that the effects
of BMI on PSA screening have the potential
to lead to missed or delayed diagnosis
of localized prostate cancer, for this
interpretation to be accurate there is an
important implicit assumption; that
variations in serum PSA level related to BMI
are not related to the risk of cancer. It is
known that there is no single PSA threshold
that accurately classifies prostate cancer risk
from a screening standpoint. However, the
probability of finding cancer on prostate
biopsy is strongly related to serum PSA level
[27]. For the relationship between BMI and
PSA to be a cause of decreased incidence, the
mechanism through which BMI influences
serum PSA must be independent of the risk of
prostate cancer. If this is not the case, then for
any given value of PSA, obese men should
have the same risk of prostate cancer on
biopsy as men with a normal BMI. In other
words, obese men might have lower serum
PSA level on average simply because the
average obese man has a lower risk of
prostate cancer. It is not possible to address
this question with the current data, but at
least one recent study of patients with
prostate cancer suggested that alterations
in serum PSA due to BMI are related to
physiological changes in plasma volume
associated with obesity [15]. Such changes in
plasma volume should have no association
with cancer risk.
In conclusion, the inverse association
between serum PSA level and BMI is
potentially relevant to the interpretation of
PSA as a prostate cancer screening test in
obese white non-Hispanic men. It might also
partly explain previous observations of a
decreased overall prostate cancer incidence
and a higher incidence of more locally
advanced disease in this subgroup of patients.
Additional prospective studies are needed to
better define the BMI­PSA association in
racial minority subgroups.
