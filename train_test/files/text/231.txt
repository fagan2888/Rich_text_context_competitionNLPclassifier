Objectives. Previous research on differences between Black and White older adults has produced inconsistent results
on whether a gap in disability exists and whether it persists over time. The present research identifies several reasons for
the inconsistent results to date and examines Black/White differences in disability trajectories over 6 years.
Methods. Data from the North Carolina Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (1986­
1992) are used to estimate the disability gap and trajectory over time for both Black and White older adults.
Results. Results indicate that a disability gap between Black and White adults exists, but after socioeconomic
resources, social integration, and other health indicators are adjusted for, the trajectories of disability by race are not
significantly different. Controlling for incident morbidity over time accounts for the significant difference in level of
disability between the two groups.
Discussion. This research supports the ``persistent inequality'' interpretation, indicating that Black adults have higher
morbidity and disability earlier in life compared with White adults, and that the gap neither converges nor diverges over
time.
SOCIOLOGICAL, epidemiologic, and clinical research has
consistently shown that there is a glaring difference in
health between White and Black Americans. Black adults
have consistently poorer health, fewer visits to a doctor, and
higher mortality rates for a wide range of conditions (Clark &
Maddox, 1992; Hummer, 1996). Black Americans are more
likely to have longer hospital stays and more days sick in bed
than White Americans (Liao, McGee, Cao, & Cooper, 1999). In
addition, Black adults are at higher risk for most types of
cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke than their
White counterparts (Manton & Stallard, 1997).
The evidence regarding racial differences in disability dur-
ing later life, however, has been less clear. A number of
studies have shown that Black older adults have much poorer
physical functioning than White older adults, indicating that a
disability gap exists (Clark & Maddox, 1992; Ferraro, Farmer,
& Wybraniec, 1997; Ostchega, Harris, Hirsch, Parsons, &
Kington, 2000; Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997). Some
research shows that the disability gap increases over time
(Clark, 1997; Liao et al. 1999), and other research shows that
the gap decreases and even converges among the oldest old
(Clark, Maddox, & Steinhauser, 1993; Gibson, 1991; Guralnik,
Land, Blazer, Fillenbaum, & Branch, 1993; Johnson, 2000;
Mendes de Leon et al., 1997). The disability gap goes beyond
convergence in the later years, some argue, such that a ``disabil-
ity crossover'' emerges around age 80, at which point surviving
Black adults have better physical functioning than their
White counterparts (Clark, 1996; Clark & Maddox, 1992;
Guralnik, Land, et al., 1993; Johnson, 2000).
Given the inconsistency in the results to date, further
research is needed to clarify whether aging amplifies, reduces,
or maintains earlier inequalities. The purpose of this article is to
identify reasons for the inconsistent results and examine Black/
White differences in disability trajectories over time.
The Black/White Disability Gap:
Why the Inconsistent Results?
To better understand the inconsistent results, we find it
important to note that there are theoretical or conceptual frame-
works that support either amplification or reduction of the
gap. Most of the research pointing to a widening of the dis-
ability gap in later life is premised upon a cumulative disad-
vantage perspective (Dannefer, 1987). It is widely understood
that many Black people experience a cascade of disad-
vantages from birth to later life. Many of these disadvantages
are related to economic inequality, but they are interwoven in
other systems of stratification. Cumulative disadvantage theory
holds that there are enduring effects of these early experi-
ences. People are set on health trajectories as a result of
disadvantages experienced across the life course, and the ef-
fects amplify in later years. Indeed, this idea bears much re-
semblance to the double jeopardy hypothesis in studies of
minority aging, but that hypothesis specifies older adulthood
itself as a key disadvantage (Bengtson, Burgess, & Parrott,
1997; Dowd & Bengtson, 1978; Ferraro & Farmer, 1996).
In contrast, convergence of health inequality in later life is
often seen as a matter of selective survival. Whereas Black
persons have higher mortality in the early years, a more select
set of them reaches older ages, when compared with White
persons. This has also been coupled with hardiness (Williams &
Lawler, 2001) and acquired-immunity hypotheses (Preston,
Hill, & Drevenstedt, 1998), suggesting that older Black persons
are, to some degree, a survivor elite. Moreover, in sample sur-
veys, there is the added concern of selective sampling,
whereby nonrespondents are more likely to be disadvantaged
(e.g., physically or cognitively impaired). In short, failure to
consider differential racial mortality--and nonrandom selec-
tion, more generally--may give the appearance of decreasing
health disparities.

Beyond the conceptual frameworks used, there are several
substantive and methodological issues that may account for the
inconsistency in the empirical literature. First, race differences in
disability among older adults have often been attributed to
differencesinsocioeconomicstatus.Infact,someresearchersfind
that the disability gap does notexist--or is greatly reduced--after
they account for differences in education and income among
Black and White adults (Guralnik, Land, et al., 1993; Liao et al.,
1999; Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997; White-Means &
Hammond, 1993). However, not all findings are consistent with
this premise, indicating that other risk factors in addition to
socioeconomic status contribute to the racial disability gap (Clark
& Maddox, 1992; Clark et al., 1993; Liao et al., 1999; Mendes
de Leon et al., 1997). The issue may be which measures of
socioeconomic status are considered. The mechanisms linking
socioeconomic status to health have been shown to be different
for Black and White older adults, underscoring the need for
a multidimensional approach to the measurement of socioeco-
nomic status (Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997). Many studies
use only one or two indicators, typically education, income, or
both (Clark et al., 1993; Mendes de Leon et al., 1997). Income,
although important, gives only part of the economic picture
because wealth accumulation is critical to understanding
consumption patterns and lifestyle choices of older people.
Occupational history may also be important for understanding
disability because certain types of work are associated with
physical demands that may accelerate or prevent disability.
Second, morbidity is seen as the key antecedent of disability,
and specific health conditions such as diabetes, stroke, hip frac-
ture, and heart attack may lead to a sharp increase in disability
(Guralnik, LaCroix, et al., 1993; Guralnik, LaCroix, Branch,
Kasl, & Wallace, 1991). As Verbrugge and Jette (1994) de-
scribe it, pathology is the first stage of the disablement process.
Most of the longitudinal studies examine the effects of initial
morbidity on subsequent disability (Clark, 1996; Liao et al.,
1999; Mendes de Leon et al., 1997). If Black adults have higher
incident morbidity, failure to account for it may lead
investigators to miss an important part of the disablement
process. One study that incorporated change in morbidity found
that it was part of an overall spiral of health decline (Ferraro
et al., 1997). Although that investigation made use of a count
of comorbidity, it may be useful to next consider the effects
of specific diseases on disability, especially because of the dis-
tinct morbidity profiles of Black and White older adults.
The way previous researchers have treated morbidity,
socioeconomic status, and the relationship between them
may well account for much of the inconsistency in findings on
the Black/White disability gap. Nevertheless, there are two
methodological limitations that may add to the inconsistency.
First, much of the research examining Black/White differences
in disability has been conducted on single-wave samples
(Ostchega, et al., 2000; Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997;
White-Means & Hammond, 1993) or panel studies of few or
short follow-ups (Guralnik, Land, et al., 1993; Johnson, 2000;
Seeman et al., 1994). Morbidity incidence and subsequent
disability require time to fully develop and may not be detected
when all measures are collected at the same time point or when
the time lag is too short.
Second, panel data, especially with three or more waves, are
excellent for studying the disablement process, but they also
entail the complication of attrition. Death, refusal, and loss
to follow-up could potentially reduce the number of subjects
at subsequent waves, and attrition is likely to be nonrandom
(Lillard & Panis, 1998). Black Americans, older adults, less
healthy persons, and men have higher mortality rates, in-
creasing the likelihood that the remaining sample will be dis-
proportionately White Americans, younger adults, healthier
persons, and women (Guralnik, Land, et al., 1993). With few
exceptions (e.g., Mendes de Leon et al., 1997), previous re-
search on race differences in disability has not accounted for
potential selection bias that is due to attrition. The likely
consequence is that the gap in disability between Black and
White adults over time may be underestimated because the
remaining sample is younger and healthier.
The present research seeks to help resolve the inconsis-
tency in research findings on the Black/White disability gap
in later life by addressing the limitations of previous research
enumerated herein. A fuller, although not comprehensive, set of
socioeconomic status (SES) variables is examined. Morbidity,
including incident morbidity over six follow-up periods,
is considered in studying the disablement process. Disability
trajectories are estimated with structural equation models while
accounting for attrition. The research focuses on three ques-
tions. First, does a disability gap exist between Black and
White older adults? If yes, two additional questions follow
logically. Does the gap widen, shrink (perhaps to the point of
reversing the gap), or remain stable over time? Does current or
incident morbidity narrow or account for the racial disparity in
disability among older adults? Consistent with the cumulative
disadvantage perspective, it is hypothesized that the racial dis-
ability gap exists in later life and will widen over time. It is
anticipated that race differences in the number of prevalent
health conditions will most likely account for much of the racial
disability gap, relative to incident morbidity, but that selected
health conditions that develop during the course of the study
(e.g., stroke) will heighten disability.
METHODS
Sample
This research uses data from the North Carolina Established
Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
(EPESE). Residents were sampled from five counties in North
Carolina to reflect urban and rural counties in the Southeast
United States. Baseline data were collected in household
interviews in 1986, and six subsequent annual waves were
collected between 1987 and 1992. Black Americans were
oversampled so that the final sample of 4,162 adults aged 65
years and older includes 2,257 African Americans (54%). The
sample also includes 26 persons who were not classified as Black
or White. These persons were combined with the White subjects
in the file that was archived with the Interuniversity Consortium
for Political and Social Research. Thus, it is impossible to
identify these cases in the publicly available data. Thirty-five
percent of the sample did not complete all seven waves, leaving
2,567 respondents at the seventh interview. Of those who did
not finish the study, only 129 did not due to refusal or loss to
follow-up; the vast majority of attrition was due to death. De-
tails of the sampling and interviewing procedures can be found
in the article by Cornoni-Huntley and colleagues (1993).
BLACK/WHITE DISABILITY GAP S35
Measurement
Table 1 contains all of the variables, the coding, means,
and standard deviations for the total sample and separately for
Black and White adults. The dependent variable for these
analyses is disability and is based on respondents' reports of
their level of ability to perform seven activities of daily living
(ADLs): walking, eating, dressing, grooming, transferring to
a chair from the bed, bathing, and using the toilet (Katz, Ford,
Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffee, 1963). There were three
possible response categories: able to perform the task without
help (0), able to perform the task with some help (1), or unable
to perform the task independently (2). The questions about
physical function at baseline asked participants if they had
trouble any time in the preceding 12 months. A follow-up
question asked if the participants still had trouble performing
the task. Respondents who needed help in the previous year
but did not currently require aid to perform the task were
considered to be independent and were coded as 0. This made
the measures at baseline consistent with each of the follow-up
interviews, which capture current dependencies only. The re-
sponses from the seven ADL tasks (within the same wave) were
then summed, creating a single measure of disability ranging
from 0, meaning the respondent needed no help in any do-
main, to 14, meaning the respondent could not perform any of
the tasks independently (a ¼ .89). This measure is identical
at all seven waves. There were 86 respondents who were alive
and interviewed but did not answer the ADL questions at
one or more waves.
Socioeconomic status is measured with several variables.
Education has four categories: 0 to 7 years (1); 8 to 11 years
(2); 12 years (3); and more than 12 years (4). Total family
income is measured with five categories ranging from less
than $5,000 (1); $5,000 to $6,999 (2); $7,000 to $9,999
(3); $10,000 to $14,999 (4); and $15,000 or more (5). As a

measure of wealth, these models include an indicator for
whether the respondent owns his or her home. Those who own
their home are coded as 1; all others are coded as 0. Measures
of employment are also included. Those who were currently
employed at baseline are identified in a dichotomous variable
(1 ¼ employed; 0 ¼ not employed). Respondents were also
asked the primary type of work they performed during their
years of employment. Only two were significant in preliminary
models and were therefore retained: professional career and
labor career. Both are coded so that 1 equals the name of the
variable and 0 is used for all others. The reference group for
these analyses includes those who performed primarily retail,
service, managerial, or operative work during years of
employment.
Several indicators of social integration were included in
these analyses. Marital status was identified with two binary
variables: married and widowed. In both cases, those with that
marital status were coded as 1. All others were coded as 0.
Frequency of religious service attendance ranged from never
(1) to more than once a week (6). Total number of living
children ranges from none (0) to five or more (5). Respondents
were also asked the following question: ``Other than your
children, how many relatives do you have that you feel close
to?'' The response categories range from none (0) to 5 or more
(3). Those who live alone were identified with the value of 1 in
a binary variable. All others were coded as 0.
Self-reported depression is measured with a sum of 20
items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Respondents were asked about
their general feelings in the past month, such as whether they
enjoyed life, had the blues, had restless sleep, or felt people
disliked them, with possible responses being ``yes'' (1) or ``no''
(0). Four items were reverse coded and all 20 items were then
summed. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive
symptomatology or depressive mood.
Several indicators of health status and behavior, including
seven existing health conditions, were also measured in these
analyses. Respondents were asked if they had ever been told by
medical personnel that they had cancer, heart trouble (including
heart attack), stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, hip fracture,
or broken bones. Each is coded as 1 if the condition is present
and 0 if not. Incontinence is measured separately and ranges
from never (1) to all of the time (5). Current smokers and past
smokers were each identified with binary variables.
Demographic variables include being Black, being female,
and living in a rural area. All three are binary variables, in
which 1 equals the name of the variable. All others are coded as
0. Age ranges from 64 to 105 years.
Analysis
The first stage of the analysis uses the continuous measures
of disability at all seven waves to estimate the overall level and
trajectory of disability. These trajectories are estimated by using
latent growth curves in structural equation models. Individual
change in disability is modeled as a function of time and is
then used to estimate change in disability for the total sample
(Bollen & Curran, 2001; Meredith & Tisak, 1990; Willett &
Sayer, 1994).
Figure 1 illustrates the proposed measurement model of the
trajectory of disability over time. Both of the latent constructs
have seven indicators of disability, one at each wave. Level
is a latent construct of the average level of disability for all
7 years. Trajectory is a latent construct of the rate of change in
disability over time. A nonlinear trajectory, where the paths to
the third through seventh wave disability measures are freely
estimated rather than fixed to a particular value, was tested but
Figure 1. Conceptual latent growth model of disability over 7 years: North Carolina Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of
the Elderly, 1986­1992. The latent construct for the level has fixed paths to each measure of disability: the value of 1 for the path to disability at each
wave. The latent construct for the slope has fixed paths for the first two measures of disability, 0 and 1, respectively, to set the metric of the slope
(McArdle & Hamagami, 1991). Each subsequent disability measure is fixed to a consecutively higher number (2, 3, etc.) to estimate the linear slope.
BLACK/WHITE DISABILITY GAP S37
was not a significantly better fit than the linear slope. In the
full model, both latent constructs of level and trajectory are
regressed on baseline exogenous covariates. Key instrumental
variables in the models are noted in the tables.
The research questions of whether a disability gap exists
between Black and White older adults and what happens to that
gap over time are tested by estimating a measurement model
of the disability trajectory for the total sample, with only race,
gender, and age as exogenous covariates. If a gap does exist,
full models are then estimated with socioeconomic resources,
social integration, and morbidity indicators to test whether these
covariates account for the racial health disparity. The final stage
of these analyses is to test the time-varying impact of incident
morbidity on disability and determine whether accounting for
the temporal effect of this relationship explains the remaining
racial disability gap. The level and trajectory of disability are
estimated in the manner described herein, but incident health
conditions (since the previous wave) are lagged to estimate dis-
ability at the subsequent wave. This provides adjusted estimates
of disability prior to the calculation of the level and trajectory
(Sayer & Cumsille, 2001).
In this sample of older adults, there is significant attrition.
Each model is adjusted for nonrandom attrition by using a
hazard rate instrument based on the inverse Mills ratio ex-
pressing the likelihood of not remaining in the study for all
seven waves (Heckman, 1979). A probit equation estimates the
likelihood of completing all seven waves of the study. Based on
that likelihood, an inverse Mills ratio is calculated for each case
so that high values indicate a strong likelihood of not com-
pleting the study. This variable is entered into the substantive
model as a covariate (Berk, 1983).
There are several advantages to the latent growth curve
procedure for these analyses. First, no assumption about the
linearity of the disablement process over time is required, and
this is actually tested. Second, it incorporates information from
all seven waves of data simultaneously in the same model in-
stead of simply capturing change between end points or consec-
utive pairs of survey waves. Third, the latent growth curve
models can incorporate time-varying covariates, capturing
change that occurred during the study.
RESULTS
For the research questions in this article to be answered, four
separate latent growth curve models were estimated. Table 2
contains comparisons of model fit across all four models; Tables
3 and 4 present the estimates of the covariates for each model.
Model fit across all four models will be compared first, followed
by a discussion of the covariates in each individual model.
Model 1 is the basic disability model, with only race, sex,
and age as exogenous covariates. Model statistics indicate
a fairly good fit. The goodness of fit index and the incremen-
tal fit index are both .99. The root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) is .05, which is at the threshold for
acceptance (Kelloway, 1998). The level, which is .48, is the
adjusted mean of disability for 7 years. The adjusted slope, .10,
is the rate of change in disability over time. This means that for
each year, the average change in disability is an increase of .10.
Model 2 enters all of the covariates into the model and
reestimates the level and slope. Model fit improved from
Model 1. The RMSEA decreased to .01 and the incremental fit
index increased to 1.00. The adjusted level of disability slightly
decreased, and the slope slightly increased. Model 3 uses a
multigroup estimation for Black and White adults, controlling
for all of the covariates in Model 2. Model fit is again strong;
the RMSEA value is equal to .01 and the goodness of fit index
for both groups is .99. Black older adults have a significantly
higher level of disability than White older adults, but after the
covariates are controlled for, the slope is not significantly
different by race.
Model 4 extends the analysis by including incident morbid-
ity between waves as covariates. Chi-square is 522.36 with 302
degrees of freedom. The incremental fit index is 1.00 and the
RMSEA is .01. This is an excellent fit, especially for a second-
order latent growth model because of the addition of another
level of latent variables (Sayer & Cumsille, 2001).
Table 3 contains the estimates for Models 1, 2, and 3. For
each latent growth curve model, results presented are the
estimates of the covariates on the level and slope for disability
over time. When sex and age are accounted for, Black older
adults are significantly more likely to have higher levels of
disability and steeper slopes over the observation period. This
means that the disability gap does indeed exist, with Black
older adults having significantly higher levels of overall
disability. In addition, Black older adults have a significantly
steeper trajectory of disability, indicating that their levels of
disability increase at a faster rate than those of White older
adults. This provides evidence that the disability gap continues
to widen over time.

ates into the model, including socioeconomic resources, social
integration, and baseline morbidity. This model also includes
the adjustment for nonrandom attrition. The separate sample
analysis (Model 3) reveals that when SES and other covariates
are controlled for, Black older adults are more likely than White
older adults to have a higher level of disability (.51 vs. .42) but
no longer have a significantly steeper slope (.12 vs. .10) than
White adults. This means that Black adults have a higher
average level of disability and that the gap persists over
time, neither increasing nor decreasing. Other predictors of a
higher level of disability are being depressed, being incontinent,
having had a stroke, having high blood pressure, or having a hip
fracture. A significantly lower level of disability was predicted
by living in a rural area, being employed at baseline, having had
a labor career, being a homeowner, attending religious services
more frequently, not living alone, and being a current smoker.
The trajectory or slope of disability over time is higher for
older adults, those with diabetes at baseline, those who live in
a rural area, and those who did not have a professional career.
The slope of disability was also significantly predicted by the
hazard rate variable for attrition. The relationship was positive,
indicating that persons who were at the highest risk of attrition
had steeper disability slopes. In short, disability estimates in
panel data without an adjustment for nonrandom attrition likely
underestimate true health disparities.
Model 3 estimates the level and slope of disability separately
for Black and White adults, using the multigroup method in
LISREL 8.5. Both groups share many of the same predictors of
the level and slope of disability. Current employment, frequent
attendance at religious services, and current smoking at base-
line predict lower levels of overall disability. Being depressed,
being incontinent, and having had a stroke or a hip fracture are
predictive of higher levels of overall disability for both Black
and White adults. The trajectory of disability over time is
higher among the oldest Black and White adults, those who
are not married, and those with diabetes.
Several covariates, however, are not consistent across race
groups. Even though the relationships were significant for one

group and not the other, the influence of having a labor career
or high blood pressure on the level of disability did not
significantly differ between Black and White older adults.
Likewise, being employed and having cancer were not
significantly different across groups in their prediction of the
disability slope.
When the relationships that are significantly different across
race groups are compared, marriage has a protective effect on the
slope of disability for Black adults, but the effect is not apparent
for White adults. Additionally, the protective effect of living in
a rural area holds for Black older adults only; living in a rural
area predicts lower overall levels of disability, but not for
White adults. Having a professional career is actually associ-
ated with higher levels of disability for Black adults, but it
alsopredictsloweroveralltrajectoriesofdisability.Alternatively,
having a labor career is associated with higher slopes of dis-
ability only for White older adults. Home ownership predicts
lower levels of disability for White adults only.
Among health conditions, high blood pressure does not
significantly affect the level or trajectory of disability for Black
adults. It does, however, have a detrimental effect for White
adults. Having diabetes likewise does not affect the overall le-
vel of disability for Black adults, but it is associated with lower
levels of disability for White adults. Having broken bones at
baseline predicts lower disability slopes for Black adults but
has no significant effect for White adults. The negative rela-
tionship between broken bones and the slope of disability over
time is probably indicative of the recovery process associated
with healing.
Nonrandom attrition is consequential for both groups. The
attrition lambda is positive and significant for the slope of
disability among White older adults, indicating that those
who were at highest risk of attrition had higher trajectories
of disability. Black older adults have positive and significant
lambdas for both the level and slope of disability. Thus, those
Black subjects with the greatest likelihood of attrition had
higher levels of disability and the most rapid increases in
disability. This indicates that models that do not account for
nonrandom selection underestimate the amount of disability--
especially among Black older adults.
The final stage of the analysis tests whether incident morbid-
ity, a direct measure of changing health status, accounted for
all or some of the remaining racial disability gap. Table 4
presents those results.
At each wave, respondents were asked whether they had
developed heart trouble, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes,
hip fractures, broken bones, or cancer since the last interview.
Rather than being cumulative, these questions measure incident
morbidity. As seen in Table 4, the incident health conditions at
each wave were not used as independent predictors of the level

and slope of disability. This is because the level and slope are
estimated by using the disability measures from all waves
simultaneously, and using incident morbidity to estimate the
level and slope would violate temporal ordering. Instead, dis-
ability at each wave was regressed on its wave-specific health
conditions.
Incident heart trouble, stroke, hip fracture, and broken bones
contributed to higher disability at the following wave. Newly
diagnosed cancer also predicts higher disability at later waves.
There were few changes in the other covariates compared to
Model 2. However, the remaining significant difference in the
disability level between Black and White older adults was
explained with the incorporation of time-varying morbidities.
DISCUSSION
This article began with three research questions: Does a racial
disability gap exist? If yes, what happens to that gap over time?
Does incident morbidity explain all or part of that gap? These
analyses demonstrate that, indeed, a disability gap between
Black and White adults exists and that the gap persists over
time. Before SES, morbidity, and social support were con-
trolled for, the gap continued to increase over time, which is
consistent with the cumulative disadvantage theoretical frame-
work (Dannefer, 1987). After social and health factors were
controlled for, however, Black adults manifested a consis-
tently higher level of disability, consistent with previous
research on the double jeopardy hypothesis showing stability
in race differences in health across the life course (Ferraro,
1987; Ferraro & Farmer, 1996). Despite the age-restricted
sample of the EPESE, these results are parallel with these
other studies, indicating persistent inequality in disability over
time between Black and White older adults, neither diverging
nor converging. These findings are not consistent, however,
with a number of studies that have found a ``disability cross-
over.'' Similar to the mortality crossover, some scholars report
that the racial disability gap converges and that the oldest-
old Black adults eventually have better physical functioning
than their White counterparts (Clark et al., 1993; Guralnik,
Land, et al., 1993).
To extend the examination of racial disability trajectories, we
asked the following question: Is it possible that simply
controlling for baseline health conditions did not account for
the impact from incident morbidity on physical function over
time? The final model in the analysis tested the effect of time-
varying indicators of morbidity on disability. In this study, all
of the health conditions (heart trouble, stroke, diabetes, broken
bones, broken hip, and cancer) except high blood pressure
were positively associated with disability at a minimum of one
wave. It is not surprising that hypertension did not have an in-
dependent effect on disability. It is often a risk factor for other
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular health conditions such as a
heart attack or stroke (Manton & Stallard, 1997).
After covariates in Model 2 were controlled for, the
difference in the slope of disability between Black and White
adults became nonsignificant. It is known that older Black
adults are significantly more likely to have a number of health
conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, stroke, and most types of cancer (Bradley, Given, &
Roberts, 2001; Manton & Stallard, 1997; Miles & Bernard,
1992; Svetkey, George, Burchett, Morgan, & Blazer, 1993).
Baseline health conditions accounted for some of the differ-
ence in overall level of disability by race, but the model in-
corporating incident morbidity rendered the racial differences in
disability nonsignificant. Thus, capturing the ``moving picture''
of morbidity among older Black and White adults accounted for
the remaining disability gap and provided a better understand-
ing of the dynamics of health decline.
This article makes several contributions to the research on
race differences in health. First, it examines the disability gap
between Black and White older adults with seven repeated
measures of both disability and morbidity over time. With the
use of latent growth curve models, it was demonstrated that
Black older adults experience steeper increases in disability
over time compared with White older adults, which is similar to
other research (Clark, 1997; Liao et al., 1999). However, once
morbidity, socioeconomic resources, and social integration
were controlled, Black adults continued to have a higher level
of disability but no longer differed significantly from White
adults in the rate of disablement over time. Thus, examining the
groups separately demonstrates that even though a number of
predictors of disability vary by race, the disability gap does not
continue to increase over time. The gap is quite stable, indi-
cating a persistent inequality among Black and White older
adults. This finding is less common in the literature, but is
consistent with some previous studies (Clark & Maddox, 1992;
Ferraro & Farmer, 1996; Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1997).
The second contribution is the adjustment for the effects of
nonrandom attrition. In this sample of older adults, age and
mortality selection do not temper the disability gap, as has been
hypothesized in the past. In fact, older adults who were at the
highest risk of attrition had significantly higher levels of dis-
ability and steeper disability slopes and the bias was greatest
for Black older adults. A number of studies that have found
a disability crossover between Black and White older adults did
not account for selective survival (for an exception, see Mendes
de Leon et al., 1997) and may be underestimating the
existence--and persistence--of disability. After an adjustment
for nonrandom attrition, these models provide no evidence that
disability converges or crosses over for Black and White older
adults. Indeed, results from the present study suggest that
failure to consider attrition may give the appearance of
a convergence in disabilities among Black and White adults.
Finally, time-varying indicators were incorporated into the
estimates of the level and trajectory of disability over time.
Rather than relying solely on information at baseline, the time-
varying indicators allow the models to capture changes in pre-
dictors over the course of observation. Although some variables
such as income may not change drastically over the course of
study, changes in morbidity can be very consequential. A single
health condition such as a stroke could cause a sharp spike in
disability, but if it did not occur prior to baseline, then it may
not be captured in the model. Other time-varying covariates
may be consequential to physical functioning, such as changes
in marital status, living arrangements, social support, and
cognitive ability. These should be considered in future research.
There are two limitations of note in the present study. First,
these results are from a single geographic region in North
Carolina and cannot be generalized to other areas of the United
States. Indeed, Mendes de Leon and colleagues (1997) found
inconsistent results on the racial disability crossover in two
BLACK/WHITE DISABILITY GAP S41
different areas of the nation; Black older adults had less
disability after age 75 than their White counterparts in the New
Haven EPESE, but no such crossover was found in the North
Carolina EPESE. The absence of a disability crossover between
Black and White older adults in North Carolina that has been
found in other regions may be due to differences in geography,
social structure, and history. Health trajectories, begun decades
before, may manifest consistently higher disability among sur-
viving Black adults in North Carolina compared with those in
other areas of the nation.
Second, the measurement of several key concepts is limited. In
these analyses, SES included income, education, home owner-
ship, employment status, and primary occupation. However, for
a complete understanding of the nature of economic disadvantage
among older Black and White adults and its impact on subsequent
health trajectories to be gained, a full spectrum of measures
should be included such as sources of income, eligibility for
social programs, and intergenerational transfers. Additionally,
this research utilizes a single, one-dimensional measure of
disability. Restrictions in self-care such as bathing, dressing,
and using the bathroom independently do not represent the vast
majority of community-dwelling elders. Hence, measurement of
disability that focuses on these extreme limitations in physical
function risks a ``floor effect,'' whereby the majority of the
sample has no or very few reportable difficulties. Further
examination of the nature of the racial disability gap requires
a multidimensional approach as called for in Verbrugge and Jette
(1994), including the social, emotional, higher level physical
functioning, cognitive, and sensory domains of disability.
Disability is one more health outcome for which a racial
disparity exists. Even after nonrandom attrition is adjusted for,
Black adults have significantly higher levels of disability. Con-
trolling for SES, morbidity, and other covariates at baseline
did not fully explain the racial disability gap between Black and
White older adults. Only after the time-varying effect of incident
morbidity was measured on the slope and trajectory of disability
did the residual race differences disappear. This means that Black
elders, despite their hardiness, are more likely than their White
counterparts to experience compromised physical function as
a result of new health conditions and diseases.
