INTRODUCTION
Despite the decrease in overall cancer incidence and mortality rates in the US
since the early 1990s, cancer remains a major public health problem. To provide an
up-to-date perspective on the occurrence of cancer, the American Cancer Society
presents an overview of cancer frequency, incidence, mortality, and survival statistics
for the year 2001.
METHODS
Estimated New Cancer Cases
Because the US does not have a nationwide cancer registry, the exact number of
new cases of cancer diagnosed each year in the US and in all individual states is not
known. Consequently,we first estimated the number of new cancer cases occurring
annually in the US from 1979 through 1997 using population data reported by the
US Bureau of the Census and age-specific cancer incidence rates collected by the
National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)

ABSTRACT Each year the American Cancer Society compiles estimates of the number of new
cancer cases and deaths expected in the US in the current year and the most recent data on
cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. An estimated 1,268,000 new cases of cancer will be
diagnosed in the year 2001 and an estimated 553,400 Americans will die from cancer. Overall
cancer incidence and death rates have continued to decrease in men and women since the early
1990s, and the decline in overall cancer mortality has been greater in recent years. Despite
reductions in age-adjusted rates of cancer death, the total number of recorded cancer deaths in
the US continues to increase, due to an aging and expanding population. Large disparities in
cancer incidence and mortality across racial/ethnic groups continue. Black men and women
experience higher incidence of cancer and poorer survival than white men and women. The
disparity in survival reflects both diagnosis of cancer at later disease stages, and poorer survival
within each stage of diagnosis. (CA Cancer J Clin 2001;51:15-36.)

program.1 We fit these annual cancer case
estimates with an autoregressive quadratic
model to forecast the number of cancer cases
expected to be diagnosed in the US in the year
2001.2
The observed trend in prostate cancer
incidence was not compatible with the selected
forecasting model, as rates increased markedly
between 1988 and 1992, declined sharply
between 1992 and 1995, and leveled off from
1995 to 1997.3 This trend likely reflects
extensive use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
screening in a previously unscreened
population and the subsequent increase in
diagnoses at an early stage.4 We therefore
assumed that the number of prostate cancer
cases is approaching the pattern in effect prior
to widespread use of PSA screening, and
estimated new cases of prostate cancer for 2001
using a linear projection based on data from
1979 to 1989 and 1995 to 1997 only.
Because cancer incidence rates and case
counts for 1979 through 1997 were not
available for many states, we could not use the
methods mentioned earlier to estimate new
cases for individual states. To derive these
estimates, we relied on state cancer death data
and assumed that the ratio of cancer deaths to
cancer cases for each state was the same as the
ratio for the US.2
Estimated Cancer Deaths
We estimated the number of cancer deaths
expected to occur in the US and in each state
in the year 2001 using underlying cause-of-
death data from death certificates,as reported to
the National Center for Health Statistics.5 The
recorded numbers of cancer deaths occurring
annually from 1979 to 1998 in the US and in
each state were fit with autoregressive quadratic
models to forecast the number of cancer deaths
expected to occur in 2001.

Other Statistics
Mortality statistics for the leading causes of
death, the leading causes of death from cancer,
and age-adjusted cancer mortality rates for
1930 to 1997 were obtained using data from
the National Center for Health Statistics.5 Age-
adjusted cancer incidence rates, the probability
of developing cancer, and five-year relative
survival rates were obtained from the SEER
program.3,6
SELECTED FINDINGS
Expected Numbers of New Cancer Cases
In the year 2001, we estimate that about
1,268,000 new cases of invasive cancer will
be diagnosed in the US (Table 1). This
estimate does not include carcinoma in situ
of any site except urinary bladder, and it does
not include basal and squamous cell cancers
of the skin. More than a million cases of
basal and squamous cell skin cancers, 46,400
cases of breast carcinoma in situ, and 31,400
cases of in situ melanoma are expected to
be newly diagnosed in 2001. Estimated
numbers of new cancer cases by state are
shown in Table 2.
Among men, the most common cancers in
2001 are expected to be cancers of the prostate,
lung and bronchus, and colon and rectum (Fig.
1). The prostate is the leading site for cancer
incidence, accounting for 31% of new cancer
cases in men. This year 198,100 new cases of
prostate cancer are expected to be diagnosed.
Among women,the three mostly commonly
diagnosed cancers are expected to be cancers of
the breast, lung and bronchus, and colon and
rectum (Fig.1). Cancers occurring at these sites
are expected to account for over 50% of new
cancer cases in women. Breast cancer alone is
expected to account for 192,200 new cancer
cases (31%) in 2001.
Lifetime Probability of Developing Cancer
The lifetime probability of developing
cancer is higher in men (43.48%) than in
women (38.34%) (Table 3), but women have a
higher probability than men of developing any
cancer before age 60. In general, however, the
probability of developing specific cancers is
higher in men than women at all ages, with the
exception of breast cancer and cancers specific
to women.
Trends in Cancer Incidence
For all sites combined, age-adjusted cancer
incidence rates declined an average of 1.3% per
year from 1992 to 1997, reversing increasing
trends in earlier years (Fig. 2).7 However, the
overall decline has been limited to incidence
rates among men, which were heavily
influenced by trends in prostate cancer
incidence. Declines have also been seen
recently for several other leading cancer sites
(Figs. 3 and 4).

Breast cancer incidence remained
approximately level during the 1990s, but may
appear to be decreasing in younger women.3
Colon and rectum cancer incidence began to
decline in 1985, on average 1.6% per year
through 1997. Decreases in colon and rectum
cancer incidence rates have been observed
among males and females in all racial/ethnic
groups, (with the exception of American
Indian women for whom data were not
sufficient to make a determination as to the
direction of the trend.)3
A significant downturn in the incidence of
lung and bronchus cancer in males began in the
1980s; between 1992 and 1997, incidence rates
decreased 3.2% per year. Overall incidence
rates of female lung and bronchus cancer have
been stable since 1991, but rates have begun to
decline among women aged 40 to 59.8
Prostate cancer incidence was essentially
level from 1995 to 1997,following large annual
increases of 17.5% from 1988 to 1992 and a
sharp decline of 10.3% per year from 1992
to 1995.3

Expected Numbers of Cancer Deaths
In 2001,an estimated 553,400 Americans are
expected to die of cancer--more than 1,500
people a day (Table 4). The estimated numbers
of cancer deaths in 2001 by state are shown in
Table 5.
Also shown in Table 5 is the reported death
rate by state for the years 1993 to 1997 for all
cancers combined. The rate varied considerably
by state, with the lowest rate in Utah (119 per
100,000 per year) and the highest rate in
Washington,DC (208 per 100,000 per year). The
average age-adjusted cancer death rate across the
entire US was 168 per 100,000 per year.
Cancers of the lung and bronchus, prostate,
and colon and rectum combined are expected
to contribute 52% of cancer deaths among
men in the year 2001 (Fig. 5).Among women,

colon and rectum are expected to account for
51% of all cancer deaths in 2001 (Fig. 5). Lung
cancer has surpassed breast cancer as the
leading cause of cancer death in women since
1987 and is expected to account for 25% of all
female cancer deaths in 2001.
Trends in Cancer Death Rates
The death rate for all cancers combined
peaked in 1991 and then decreased on average
0.6% per year until 1995.The decline was even
more marked between 1995 and 1997, at 1.7%
per year (Fig. 6).3 Significant decreases in
cancer death rates have occurred among males
of all ages, and among females younger than
75 years old.7
The death rates associated with many of the
common cancer sites have also been
decreasing (Figs. 7 and 8). The breast cancer
22 CA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians
Cancer Statistics, 2001
death rate among females decreased an average
of 2.2% per year between 1990 to 1997;
decreases were more pronounced among
white women and among younger women.
Colon and rectum cancer death rates have
been decreasing 1.8% per year on average
since 1984, with equally strong declines
among men and women.3 Similar to trends in
incidence, significant decreases in death rates
for lung and bronchus cancer have occurred
only among males (on average, 1.7% per year
between 1990 and 1997); however, the
increase in lung cancer death rates among
females has begun to slow recently. Prostate
cancer death rates stopped increasing in 1991,
and decreased an average of 4.4% annually
from 1994 through 1997.3

Recorded Numbers of Deaths from Cancer and
Other Causes
Among fatal conditions in the US,all cancers
combined rank second highest, following only
heart disease (Table 6). Cancer accounted for
23.2% of all deaths in 1998. Upon examination
of causes of death by age and gender, cancer is
by far the leading cause of death among women
aged 40 to 59 and also ranks first among
women aged 60 to 79 (Table 7). The lowest
that cancer ranks as a cause of death for any
age-gender group is fifth, among men ages 20
to 39.
Tables 8 and 9 present the leading site-
specific causes of cancer death for males and
females according to age. Leukemia is the most
common cause of cancer death among men
under age 40, while lung and bronchus cancer
is the leading cause of cancer death for men 40
years and older. Prostate cancer is the second
most common cause of cancer death among
men 60 years and older. Among women,
leukemia is the leading cause of cancer death
before age 20, but breast cancer and uterine
cervical cancer each cause more deaths among
women between 20 and 39 years old. Breast
cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
among women aged 40 to 59. Lung cancer
causes the most cancer deaths among women
60 years and older.
The decrease in the total number of cancer
deaths that occurred between 1996 and 1997
among men in the US was not sustained. The
282,065 deaths recorded in 1998 represented an
increase of 955 deaths from the previous year
(Table 10). The number of prostate cancer
deaths continued to decline, however, from a
peak of 34,902 in 1994 to 32,203 in 1998. The
91,399 lung and bronchus cancer deaths among
men in 1998 remain lower than in the peak
year of 1993. Colon and rectum cancer deaths
among men were highest in 1990, and were
slightly lower in 1998 at 28,024.

TABLE 5 Estimated Cancer Deaths by Site and State, US, 2001*
Among women, the recorded number of
total cancer deaths continues to increase, with
259,467 deaths recorded in 1998, although the
rate of increase has diminished recently (Table
10). The upward trend among females is
primarily due to sustained increases in the
number of deaths from lung and bronchus
cancer. The numbers of female deaths from
breast cancer, however, have begun to decline.
Breast cancer deaths were highest in 1995 at
43,844 and have declined to 41,737 in 1998.
The number of colorectal cancer deaths among
females has remained fairly constant in recent
years.
CANCER OCCURRENCE BY RACE/ETHNICITY
Overall rates of cancer incidence vary
considerably among racial and ethnic groups
(Table 11). African Americans have the highest
incidence rates of cancer.They are about 60%
more likely to develop cancer than Hispanics
and Asian/Pacific Islanders and more than
twice as likely to develop cancer than American
Indians. Between 1990 and 1997, incidence
rates for all cancers combined decreased among
Caucasians (1.0% per year),Hispanics (1.6% per
year), American Indians (0.6% per year), and
blacks (0.5% per year), but remained relatively
stable among Asian/Pacific Islanders.3
White women are more likely to develop
breast cancer than are women of other racial
and ethnic groups, and black women are more
likely to develop cancers of the colon and
rectum.3 Incidence rates for lung and bronchus
cancer are similar among white and black
women. Black men have the highest incidence
rates for cancers of the colon and rectum and
lung and bronchus, and incidence rates of
prostate cancer among black men are at least
50% higher than rates for men of other racial
and ethnic groups.
African Americans are about 33% more
likely to die of cancer than are whites,and more
than twice as likely to die from cancer as are
Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and
Hispanics. Between 1990 and 1997, mortality
rates decreased significantly among whites
(0.7% per year), blacks (1.0% per year),
Hispanics (0.9% per year), and Asian/Pacific
Islanders (0.8% per year), but may be increasing
among American Indians.3
Black women are more likely to die of breast
and colon and rectum cancers than are women
of any other racial or ethnic group, and lung
and bronchus cancer death rates are particularly
high for both black and white women
compared with other racial or ethnic groups.
As was seen with incidence rates, black men
have the highest death rates of colon and
rectum, lung and bronchus, and prostate
cancer.3
Cancer Survival
Contributing to the higher death rates
among black men and women is a poorer
probability of survival once diagnosed with
cancer. Blacks are less likely than whites to be

diagnosed with cancer at a localized stage,when
the disease may be more easily and successfully
treated, and more likely to be diagnosed with
cancer at a regional or distant stage of disease.
This is true for most of the common cancer
sites (Fig. 9). Furthermore, for nearly every
cancer site, blacks have lower five-year relative
survival rates than whites at each stage of
diagnosis, suggesting possible influences of
differences in treatment, tumor pathology, and
comorbid conditions (Fig. 10).
There have been notable improvements over
time in the probability of survival from most

sympathetic nervous systems, lymphomas, soft-

1989/1996, five-year relative survival rates
among children for all cancer sites combined
improved from 56% to 75%.3
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
Estimates of the expected numbers of new
cancer cases and cancer deaths should be
interpreted with caution when tracking trends
over time. These estimates may vary
considerably from year to year, particularly for
less common cancers and for states with
smaller populations. We discourage the use of
these estimates to track year-to-year changes
in cancer occurrence and death. The recorded
number of cancer deaths and cancer death
rates from the National Center for Health
Statistics, and SEER cancer incidence rates are
generally more informative statistics for
tracking cancer trends. For example, breast
cancer incidence rates increased about 1% per
year between 1979 and 1982, increased 4% per
year between 1982 and 1987, and were
approximately constant between 1987 and
1996. Despite the stabilization of incidence
rates during the latter time period, the
estimates of new breast cancer cases continued
to increase between 1988 and 1996, partly due
to the residual effects of the strong rate
increases through 1987.
Our estimates are based on the most
currently available cancer mortality and
incidence data; however, these data are three
and four years old, respectively, at the time that
the estimates are calculated. As such, the effect
of large changes occurring in the three or four-
year interval between 1997 or 1998 and 2001
cannot be captured by our modeling efforts.
Finally, our estimates of new cancer cases are
based on incidence rates for the geographic
locations that participate in the SEER program
and, therefore, may not be representative of the
total US.
Despite these limitations, the American
Cancer Society estimates do provide evidence
of the current patterns of cancer incidence and
mortality in the US. Such estimates will assist
our continuing efforts to reduce the public
health burden of cancer in 21st century. CA

*The standard error is between five and 10 percentage points.
The standard error is greater than 10 percentage points.
The rate for local stage represents local and regional stages
combined.
§ Statistic could not be calculated.
Note: Staging according to SEER historic stage categories rather than
the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.

each site and race, stage categories do not total 100% because
sufficient information is not available to assign a stage to all cancer
cases.
