Introduction
In the past decades, cross-national comparative surveys have
become an important methodological tool to investigate and
compare social behavior and attitudes across different coun-
tries on the globe. The large amount of data now available
not only offers great opportunities but also poses new chal-
lenges. One of the core challenges is the functional equiva-
lence of the constructs and indicators used. Many social
scientists who use cross-national comparative survey data
for their research are not sufficiently aware of this problem.
In the meantime, however, numerous researchers have pro-
posed strategies to improve the comparability of cross-
national survey data and developed statistical tests which
allow one to determine whether empirical constructs meet
the requirements of functional equivalence in all countries in
comparison (e.g. Bachleitner et al., 2014; Blasius and
Thiessen, 2006; Davidov et al., 2011; Harkness et al., 2003,
2010). In this article, we want to make a contribution to this
type of research by investigating the functional equivalence
and validity of religiousness indicators in three prominent
cross-cultural surveys: the International Social Survey
Programme (ISSP; 2008), the World Values Survey (WVS;
2010­2014), and Religion Monitor (RM; 2008).
In the first section of this article, general theoretical­
methodological assumptions and principles of cross-cultural
comparisons are discussed. The starting point is the question
of whether social phenomena are culturally universal and
thus can be measured in different cultures by means of uni-
form scales or whether cultural relativism is the more appro-
priate position. Cross-cultural survey researchers usually
lean toward cultural universalism, assuming that the investi-
gated social constructs can be defined and operationalized in

Abstract
Cross-cultural comparative surveys have become an important tool to investigate social attitudes across different countries.
However, this methodology is confronted with a number of challenges. One of the core problems is the functional equivalence
of the concepts and indicators used. In this article, we study this problem in regard to the investigation of religiousness in
three prominent surveys, the World Value Survey, the International Social Survey Programme, and the Religion Monitor.
Our contribution starts with the fundamental question of the intercultural meaning of single items that are commonly used
for the measurement of religiosity. From the comparison of the linguistic formulation of these items in different languages
and across the three surveys, we obtain evidence of whether the concept of religiousness has the same meaning in different
countries and to what extent the results depend on the formulation of the item. Subsequently, we use confirmatory factor
analysis to test whether two religiousness scales derived from the International Social Survey Programme are structurally
equivalent across countries. In the final step, we proceed to a substantive analysis, comparing religiousness scales from the
three surveys in order to examine to what extent scales that claim to measure the same construct in fact produce similar
results when applied to different countries. Our findings suggest that the paradigm of "asking the same questions" is difficult
to apply and problematical with respect to some core indicators of individual religiousness and that questionnaires that are
based on the Western concept of religion will lead to biased results when applied to worldwide cross-cultural comparison.

a way that produces equivalent results for all participating
countries. Accordingly, it is believed that survey results--
similarities or differences between countries--correspond to
actual similarities or differences with regard to the measured
constructs. However, as we will show, the claims of item
equivalence, construct equivalence, and content validity
ought to be questioned throughout all phases of the research
process.
The topic of religiosity poses particular methodological
challenges for cross-cultural surveys. The major reason for
this lies in the difficulty of defining "religion" and "religios-
ity" and of narrowing down these concepts empirically.
Since Émile Durkheim, countless sociologists have tried to
propose an adequate definition of religion. Most sociologists
agree that a sociological definition of religion should com-
prise more than monotheistic religiosity; however, there is no
consensus concerning the scope of meaning of this term (e.g.
Hamilton, 2001; Riesebrodt, 2010). Thus, the second section
of this article deals with the basic question of defining reli-
gion in the context of cross-cultural comparative research.
In the third part, we investigate the equivalence and valid-
ity of indicators and constructs for the measurement of reli-
giousness in Western (monotheistic) and East Asian religious
cultures. Therefore, four Christian countries (Spain,
Germany, Russia, and the United States), one Muslim coun-
try (Turkey), and four East Asian countries (Thailand, South
Korea, Taiwan, and Japan) were selected for the analysis.1
Measurements in cross-national comparative surveys can be
distorted due to three types of bias: item bias (single items do
not measure the underlying indicator in the same way in dif-
ferent countries), construct bias (empirical constructs, for
example, scales, do not measure the same underlying theo-
retical concept in all countries), and method bias (distortion
of results due to different sampling and application meth-
ods). Our empirical analyses refer to the aspects of item bias
and construct bias, leaving the question of method bias aside.
Whereas much of the research in this area is limited to
testing functional equivalence by means of sophisticated sta-
tistical procedures (e.g. Davidov et al., 2011; Matsumoto and
Van de Vijver, 2011), our contribution starts with the more
fundamental question of the intercultural meaning of single
items that are commonly used for the measurement of religi-
osity (religious affiliation, prayer, and attending religious
service). From a detailed comparison of the linguistic formu-
lation of these items in different languages and across the
three surveys, we try to obtain evidence of whether the
concept of religiosity has the same meaning in the selected
countries and to what extent the results depend on the exact
formulation of the item. Subsequently, we use confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) to test whether two religiousness scales
derived from the ISSP 2008, a scale measuring "religiosity"
(belief in God, prayer, and attendance of religious service)
and an "Eastern-belief" scale (belief in reincarnation,
Nirvana, and spiritual power of ancestors), are structurally
equivalent across countries. In the final step, we proceed to a
substantive analysis, comparing religiousness scales from
the three surveys in order to examine to what extent scales
that claim to measure the same construct in fact produce
similar results when applied to different countries.
Methodological fundamentals and
challenges of cross-cultural survey
research
Cross-cultural research claims to investigate attitudes, val-
ues, and social behavior within countries and cultural areas
as well as to uncover similarities and differences between
them (e.g. Haller et al., 2009). On one hand, cross-cultural
research presupposes the existence of universal social char-
acteristics and behavior (e.g. Hofstede, 2001; Inglehart,
1977, 2000; Schwartz, 1992, 2005). Universalism has a long
tradition in sociology: Émile Durkheim (2001 [1912]), for
example, assumed in his pioneering study "The elementary
forms of religious life" that the fundamental codes of religi-
osity are similar in primitive and advanced societies. On the
other hand, anthropologists such as Herskovits (1972) and
Geertz (1973) argue in favor of a cultural relativistic approach
that human attitudes and behavior can be fully understood
only in terms of the individual's own culture but not from a
universal scientific perspective. In recent years, the contra-
dictory positions of cultural universalism and cultural
relativism have tended to converge (Reckwitz, 2005).
This development has been facilitated by the fact that
cultural areas are no longer perceived as enclosed contain-
ers (Lefebvre, 1991). Moreover, cultural-deterministic
approaches assuming a causal effect from culture on the indi-
vidual have weakened.
Most social scientists today believe in the existence of
universal types of behavior and values (Bachleitner et al.,
2014: 28). There is no consensus, however, in regard to the
question of which attitudes, values, and social behavior are
sufficiently universal to be an appropriate topic for cross-
cultural survey research (Bachleitner et al., 2014). The deci-
sion whether universality can be assumed depends on the
specific topic, theoretical considerations, and spectrum of
countries that are compared.
Cross-cultural comparisons presuppose that the investi-
gated theoretical concepts and item formulations have at
least a similar meaning across the compared countries and
cultural areas. Scholars have been analyzing this classical
claim of functional equivalence since the 1960s (Johnson,
1998). The question of functional equivalence starts with the
comparability of theories (equivalence of theory). Given the
plurality of social scientific theories, there is an obvious lack
of universal theories which cross-cultural research could rely
on (Bachleitner et al., 2014: 60). In addition, the predomi-
nant theories were developed on the social and cultural back-
ground of Western countries and cannot be translated easily
into non-Western contexts. The problem of equivalence
continues at the level of linguistic formulations. Different
Höllinger and Eder 3
languages do not always use the same terms and phrases to
describe the same social phenomenon, and specific terms
may have different meanings, relevance, and connotations:
"Terms are cultural constructs, which are socially rehearsed,
are valid in limited regions and underlie traditions"
(Bachleitner et al., 2014: 61; translated by the authors). The
cultural impact on meanings can also be seen in the historical
change of the meanings and relevance of terms, which may
occur at different periods in different societies.
The functional equivalence of latent constructs and single
indicators is a major quality criterion in cross-cultural
research. However, in many cases, this claim leads to the
selection of the lowest common denominator of measurable
indicators, which do not have the same relevance in all coun-
tries. Consequently, social constructs are rarely investigated
in their comprehensive scope and multidimensionality. In
other words, in order to satisfy the claim of functional equiv-
alence, a construct bias is accepted by putting at risk the
measurements' content validity (Van de Vijver and Leung,
1997).
Culture-dependent interpretations of item formulations by
the respondents might lead to an item bias, when single items
do not measure the underlying indicator in the same way in
different countries, which in turn puts at risk the content
validity of cross-cultural measurements. Particularly, the
translation of items is a complex task and crucial for the
equivalence of items. However, "a literal translation of items
and questionnaires does not guarantee the equivalence of
instruments [...]. Therefore functional equivalence is a much
more important objective in comparative research" (Peschar,
1982: 65). One of the biggest challenges is to determine
whether translation problems are purely linguistic or due to
different meanings across cultures (for linguistic equiva-
lence, see Harkness et al., 2010). Even within the same cul-
tural area, identical questions can have different meanings
for subcultures. In order to improve translations, procedures
like Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretest, and
Documentation ("TRAPD") and back translations from the
target language to source language are applied (e.g. Behr
et al., 2015; Harkness, 2003). The best way to reach
construct and item equivalence in cross-cultural survey
research is to work commonly on the questionnaires with
representatives from all cultural areas in an equal discourse
and close teamwork with professional translators (Behr et al.,
2015: 6­7).
Functional equivalence in cross-cultural surveys is checked
with the usual methods of reliability testing and item statistics.
Reliability is tested in regard to the internal consistency of
scales (Cronbach's alpha), difficulty of items (variance and
selectivity), and dimensionality of scales within and across
countries. Item statistics provide information on the patterns
of approval and rejection in the selected countries, but leave
unclear culturally caused method biases (e.g. culturally
dependent response patterns). The dimensionality of the data
is examined by explorative factor analyses or correspondence
analyses (e.g. multiple correspondence analyses by Blasius
and Thiessen, 2006). Currently, the most prominent method
for testing construct equivalence is CFA because this proce-
dure allows one to test whether the data for each country fit the
specified theoretical dimensions (see Byrne, 2001). Another
method for the examination of functional equivalence is based
on multi-group comparisons (multi-group confirmatory factor
analysis [MGCFA]; see Lubke and Muthén, 2004). Commonly
used fit measures in CFAs are the root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA), the standardized root mean squared
residual (SRMR), and the comparative fit index (CFI).
However, the application of these fit measures has been criti-
cized for their limited explanatory power (Prudon, 2015).
Statistical testing of the reliability and functional equiva-
lence of measurements is a precondition for high-quality
cross-national comparative survey research, but it does not
guarantee the content validity of social constructs. Two com-
monly used methods for examining construct validity are
cognitive interviews and the comparison of survey data with
external criteria. So far, only few studies have applied cogni-
tive interviewing in the context of cross-cultural surveys
(e.g. Braun, 2006; Fitzgerald et al., 2011; Höllinger et al.,
2012; Latcheva, 2011). Cognitive interviews are criticized
for the small number of respondents and the problem of
unstandardized and uncontrolled selection of cases, and
finally high costs (Behr et al., 2012: 129). Nevertheless, pre-
vious examples indicate that they contribute to prevent sta-
tistical artifacts in cross-cultural surveys (e.g. Höllinger
et al., 2012).
Definition and measurement of
religiosity
The term "religion" in its present meaning has existed for
only about two centuries. It originated, on one hand, from the
discourses of the Enlightenment that drew a sharper dividing
line between the mundane and the sacred spheres of life than
in earlier times; on the other hand, the emerging discipline of
comparative religious studies required a general concept of
religion (Hamilton, 2001; Riesebrodt, 2010). The central
points of reference for the scientific construct of religion
were the monotheistic world religions, in particular,
Protestantism. Sociologists distinguish two types of defini-
tion of religion: Substantive definitions determine religion
with respect to the belief in sacred objects, such as supra-
natural beings, or the experience of so-called sacred phe-
nomena. Riesebrodt (2010), for example, defines religion as
"practices that are based on the assumption of the existence
of (usually invisible) personal or impersonal superhuman
powers" (p. 113). In order to avoid theological constrictions,
the substance of religion is many times designated by rather
abstract terms, such as the distinction between a profane and
a sacred sphere of life (Durkheim 2001 [1912]) or the duality
between immanence and transcendence (Luhmann, 2013;
Schütz and Luckmann, 1973). The second type of definition
4 Methodological Innovations
defines religion by its social functions, for example, the
function of coping with the contingencies of human exist-
ence or the function of ensuring social cohesion. Both sub-
stantive and functional definitions have been related also to a
number of phenomena that are quite far away from the com-
monsense understanding of religion, such as the solemn feel-
ing of connectedness with one's nation or the cultic veneration
of pop stars (Riesebrodt, 2010).
Despite the extension of the meaning of religion in theo-
retical discourse, the overwhelming majority of sociological
studies on religion focus on the usual Western understanding
of the concept. Quantitative surveys that investigate individ-
ual religiousness typically consider religious beliefs (belief
in superhuman entities or powers, notions of afterlife) and
practice (such as frequency of attending religious services
and prayer; e.g. Norris and Inglehart, 2011; Pollack and
Rosta, 2015). In a number of studies, attempts have been
made to determine dimensions of religiosity by means of
scales. Pierre Brechon (2007), for example, distinguishes
four dimensions: religious practice, belief in God, religious
feelings, and trust in churches.
The use of single-variable indicators and/or scales for the
measurement of religiousness raises the question of the sta-
tistical relationship between different indicators or scales.
Stark and Glock proposed five universal dimensions which
should be considered: belief, knowledge, experience, prac-
tice, and consequences of religiousness (moral conduct of
life). In their pioneering studies, they have shown that the
dimensions of religious belief, ritual participation, individual
devotion (prayer), and religious experience are only weakly
correlated with each other (Stark and Glock, 1968). Following
this line of research, a number of American studies have con-
firmed that these dimensions are partly independent from
each other. Other scholars, however, have demonstrated that
the correlations between different dimensions of religious-
ness are rather strong (on average above 0.50) and thus argue
that religiousness should be considered a one-dimensional
construct (a detailed review of these studies can be found
in Huber, 2003). Kecskes and Wolf (1995) developed and
analyzed similar religiousness scales in Germany; they
found that the three dimensions of practice, belief, and expe-
rience are strongly correlated, forming a single factor when
submitted to factor analysis, whereas the cognitive dimen-
sion (religious knowledge) is an independent factor.
Many sociologists who study religion in cross-national
comparative perspective assume that religiosity is a univer-
sal phenomenon that can be compared across societies
according to common criteria of definition and operationali-
zation. This claim is particularly strong in the case of the RM
(Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2009). Timothy Fitzgerald rejects
such universalistic assumptions vehemently. According to
him, the concept of religion as a whole is a Western ideology
that has elevated the complex of occidental religion to the
status of a universal concept. This concept was imposed on
non-Western societies or accepted voluntarily by them in the
course of colonialism, although the cultural practices of
these people many times do not correspond to the Western
concept of religion (Fitzgerald, 2000). In his view, this is par-
ticularly true for Eastern Asia because in this cultural area
"religious" and "secular" rites and beliefs are so closely con-
nected with each other that the separation of a specific reli-
gious sphere is impossible (Fitzgerald, 2000: 159). Also,
other scholars of comparative religion and anthropologists
defend the position that it is not justified to compare religion
cross-culturally on the basis of a set of characteristics that
are shared by all religions (Saler, 1993; Smith, 1963). One
proposed solution is to define religion in the sense of
Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblances by a number
of characteristics and to designate cultural action and symbol
systems as religious if several but not necessarily all defining
characteristics are present (Hamilton, 2001; Saler, 1993;
Wilson, 1998).
The operationalization of religiosity
in three cross-national comparative
surveys
The methodology of cross-national comparative survey
research was developed in Europe and in the United States.
The European Values Study (EVS) was the first project to
establish this method in the form of a permanent research
cooperation. The first wave of EVS was carried out in 10
European countries, the United States, and Canada in 1981­
1982. Since that time, numerous countries from all conti-
nents joined this project. Due to the increasing cultural
diversity of the participating countries, it became more and
more difficult to develop questionnaires that were adequate
for all cultural areas. Thus, in the third wave of the program,
there was a split between the EVS with around 40 participat-
ing countries and the WVS with 50 member countries. Also,
the initiative for the ISSP emerged from a few highly devel-
oped Western countries. In the meantime, 25 European and a
similar number of non-European countries participate in this
project.
Since only Western countries were involved in cross-
national research in the initial period, the investigation of
religion had a clear focus on the Christian religion. In the first
wave of EVS, the central indicators for measuring religiosity
were church attendance and prayer, as well as belief in God,
heaven, hell, devil, and sin. The only item that went beyond
the monotheistic horizon was belief in reincarnation. In the
first ISSP module on religion (carried out in 1991), religion
has been studied with similar indicators. Some items, in par-
ticular the questions about "born-again experiences," are
clearly tailored to the religious culture of the United States;
outside this cultural area, these questions are difficult to
understand and of little relevance. Another study which
examines religion in cross-national comparative perspective
is the RM. This survey was carried out twice (2008 and
2013), each time in around 20 countries. RM investigates
Höllinger and Eder 5
individual religiousness more systematically than the afore-
mentioned surveys using a scale that comprises the five
dimensions of religion according to Charles Glock: belief,
participation in community rituals, individual devotion,
knowledge, and experience. In addition, this research instru-
ment distinguishes "theistic" and "pantheistic" (or non-theis-
tic) religiosity. For the theistic type of religion, individual
devotion is measured by the frequency of prayer and for the
pantheistic type by the frequency of meditation. In the same
way, the questionnaire includes items on theistic experience
("feeling that God intervenes in your life") and pantheistic
experience ("feeling to be one with all"). The five dimen-
sions (sub-scales) were combined to a single scale which
claims to measure the "centrality of religion" for respondents
from different religious backgrounds (monotheistic or poly-
theistic/non-theistic; Huber, 2009).
In the following, we will investigate the methodological
challenges of the cross-national comparative study of reli-
gion using the example of the ISSP, WVS, and RM. In the
first step, we deal with the problem of item equivalence.
Question formulation and item
equivalence
Religious affiliation
The problem of functional equivalence arises already for the
question of religious affiliation. In some countries, religious
affiliation is determined by institutional membership, and in
others, it is not. In East Asia, but also in Africa and Latin
America, many people have multiple religious identities, that
is, they take part in the rituals of several religions (Gentz,
2008; Van Binsbergen, 2004). Therefore, the question about
religious affiliation has to be reworded in correspondence
with the situation of the respective country. WVS and ISSP
have opted for different question formats. In the English
master version of the WVS, the question is, "Do you belong
to a religion or religious denomination? If yes, which one?"
In the ISSP, "What is your religious preference?" In Russia,
these items are translated as "Do you confess a religion? If
yes, which one?" (WVS) and "Do you follow a religion? If
yes, which one?" (ISSP). For Japanese respondents, the term
"religious affiliation" is not meaningful; thus, the question
was reworded to "Do you actually practice a religion? If yes,
please tick only one category from the following list." This
note was added because many Japanese participate in rituals
of more than one religion. From this first example, it gets
obvious how Western standards are translated into non-West-
ern contexts in order to fulfill comparability.
Table 1 shows the results from the question of religious
affiliation in the three surveys. In Turkey, Thailand, Japan,
and Spain, the three (or two) surveys give rather similar dis-
tributions. In Russia, the United States, and Taiwan, the
question format of the WVS--"Do you belong to a religious
denomination? If yes, which one?"--leads to significantly
higher proportions of respondents who assign themselves to
the category "no religion" than the direct question "Which is
your religious preference?" of ISSP and RM. Both in the
WVS and in the ISSP, more than half of the Japanese
respondents attributed themselves as religious none.
Apparently, only respondents who have a stronger affinity to
Buddhism or to one of the new Japanese religions (like Soka
Gakai) assign themselves as religious affiliates, while the
practice of the popular Shintoist rituals is not associated with
the term "religion." Another explanation for the high propor-
tion of non-religious in Japan could be that respondents with
multiple religious identities are reluctant to assign them-
selves to only one religion.
Indicators of individual religiousness
In most surveys on religion, the frequency of attending reli-
gious services and frequency of praying are the central indi-
cators of religious practice. In cross-national comparative
perspective, it is problematical, however, to measure the
degree of religiosity with these indicators. Only in the three
Abrahamic religions are believers expected to attend reli-
gious services on a weekly basis. And even here, there are
differences: In one part of the Muslim world, it is common
that only men participate in the communal Friday mosque
prayer, while women pray at home. Therefore, in the Turkish
ISSP, women were not asked about participation in mosque
prayer, but whether they carry out Friday prayer (Salt). In
the WVS, both men and women were asked about participa-
tion in the mosque prayer. This is evidently the reason why
the proportion of regular worshipers is almost twice as high
in the Turkish ISSP as in the WVS (see Table 2). In the
Eastern Asian religions, there is no equivalent to the mono-
theistic tradition of regular (weekly) community service.
Religious celebrations in the temple are held only on holi-
days; otherwise, there are rituals at a private shrine in one's
home and individual temple visits. Therefore, in Japan, the
item on attending religious services was adapted to "visit to
a temple or Shinto-shrine" in the WVS and "visit to a place
of prayer and devotion" in the ISSP. In Taiwan, both surveys
asked about "participation in religious activities." The large
differences between the results of WVS and ISSP for Taiwan
may be due to the fact that respondents have a different
understanding of what a religious activity is.
Also in regard to the frequency of prayer, we find consider-
able differences between the three surveys for several coun-
tries.These differences may be due to not only different formats
of response categories but also different question formulations.
Thus, the higher frequency of prayer in the Taiwanese WVS in
comparison with ISSP may be due to the fact that the WVS
question was formulated "How often do you pray or light
incense?" was formulated, whereas the ISSP asked only for
prayer. This example demonstrates that the scope of the
concept "prayer" is not clearly determined in cross-national
comparative perspective and that, therefore, the results are not
6 Methodological Innovations
fully comparable. The RM also asked about meditation; this
question, however, provides curious results which are probably
due to the fact that the concept of meditation has different con-
notations in the countries in comparison and/or that the item
formulations differed between countries (the RM does not
provide a documentation of the question wordings in the par-
ticipating countries).
ISSP and the RM included some additional questions in
order to get a more differentiated picture of the importance of
religion in the lives of respondents. In the ISSP, respondents
were asked whether they have an altar or religious objects
(such as a cross or an icon) in their home. In the RM, Hindus,
Buddhists, Taoists, and affiliates of other Eastern Asian reli-
gions were asked whether they have a shrine in their home.
Results show that this is much more frequently the case
in Eastern Asian countries and Orthodox Russia than in
Protestant and Catholic countries and indicate that religion is
probably more important for the people in the former coun-
tries than one would assume if one considers only the fre-
quency of prayer and participation in religious service. In all
three surveys, respondents were, moreover, asked to give a
self-assessment of their religiousness. As the surveys had
different numbers of response categories, the results are not
fully comparable. It is striking, however, that differences
between the studies are exceedingly high in Taiwan and
Thailand. This finding, again, indicates that the meaning of
"being religious" fundamentally differs between Western
and Eastern Asian societies.
Table 3 gives an overview of religious beliefs in the
selected countries. Although belief in God was determined
with different response categories, the three surveys produce
quite similar results with the only exception of Thailand. The
RM also asked for belief in angels and demons. In these
questions, the differences between countries are much greater
than for belief in God; the same applies to belief in hell.
Therefore, if one wants to compare the degree of disenchant-
ment across different societies, it makes sense to consider not
only the belief in God but also other religious beliefs.
In ISSP2008, efforts have been made to also consider beliefs
that are particularly relevant for Asian religions. Respondents
were asked whether they believe in reincarnation, Nirvana, and
supernatural powers of deceased ancestors. The proportion of
persons who believe in these ideas is in fact much larger in
Taiwan and Japan than in Western countries. However, South
Koreans do not believe more frequently in these ideas than
Russians and Americans and thus deviate from the Asian pat-
tern. The surprisingly high level of belief in reincarnation and
Nirvana in Turkey seems to be an artifact, due to a translation
that evokes associations with Muslim religious beliefs. It may
be the case also that Christians who indicate belief in reincarna-
tion associate it with Christian rebirth rather than the Indian
concept of reincarnation. A high proportion--20­50%--of
respondents in the four Christian countries, Turkey, and Japan
"don't know" if they believe in Nirvana. In all, 30% of the
Russian and 25% of the Japanese respondents were also unable
to say whether they believe in reincarnation and supranatural

power of ancestors. In view of these results, the criterion of item
equivalence is not fulfilled sufficiently for some questions.
In the RM, the aspect of religious experience was also
considered by the question, "How often do you experience
situations in which you have the feeling that God or some-
thing divine intervenes in your life?" The results of this ques-
tion are highly correlated with belief in God both on the
individual level (r=0.64 for the combined dataset) and on the
aggregate level of countries (r=0.91). For non-theistic reli-
gious experience, the equivalent question was, "How often
do you have the feeling that you are in one with all?" Since
the concept of "all-experience" is associated in particular
with the mystical religious traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism,
and Daoism, one should assume that such experiences occur
more frequently in Eastern Asian than in Western countries.
However, this is not reflected in the survey results: In Turkey,
Spain, and the United States, the proportion of respondents
who indicate that they have had "all-experiences" is higher
than in Thailand and South Korea. Thus, it has to be assumed
that the formulation "feeling to be one with all" was either
translated differently or that it does not transmit the intended
notion of "mystical experience" to all respondents.
Structural equivalence of religiousness
scales in ISSP 2008
In quantitative research on religion, the strength of individual
religiousness is commonly measured by scales that consider
items on religious belief (faith) and religious practice. For
monotheistic religions, the most important indicators in this
regard are belief in God, frequency of prayer, and frequency of
attendance of religious services. Prayer, participation in reli-
gious rituals, and belief in some kind of divine power are also
relevant for the East Asian religions. However, a scale that
considers only these indicators may underestimate the impor-
tance of religion in EastAsian countries. Thus, in the following,
we will compare our sample of countries in regard to two scales:
The first scale is composed of the three items mentioned
above--belief in God, prayer, and attendance of religious
service--and will be called (intensity of) "religiosity." The
second scale includes belief in reincarnation, belief in Nirvana,
and ancestor belief and will be called "eastern beliefs."
In the first step, we use CFA to examine whether this list
of items meets the criteria of structural equivalence for our
sample of countries. We hypothesize that the six items form
two distinct factors. Furthermore, we expect the two factors
to be correlated with each other. This correlation should be
higher in East Asian countries because here eastern beliefs
should go together with religious practice (measured by
the religiosity factor). In Western countries, the correlation
should be lower because here for a part of the population
eastern beliefs (and practices, such as Yoga or Tai Chi) repre-
sent an alternative to theistic religiosity (see Figure 1).
Table 4 presents the findings of the CFAs for four
countries which exhibit different patterns of results (for the
remaining countries, the analysis produces similar patterns
of results2). Consistent with our hypothesis, a two-factor
solution fits the data significantly better than a one-factor

solution. The fit measures RMSEA and CFI indicate that the
data have an acceptable fit in four countries: Spain, Germany,
Taiwan, and Japan. Consistent with our hypothesis, the cor-
relation between the two factors is higher in the two Eastern
Asian countries than in Spain and Germany. For the United
States and South Korea, the fit coefficients are at the border-
line of an acceptable fit (which is 0.08 for RMSEA and 0.97
for CFI). In the United States and South Korea, religiosity
and eastern beliefs are practically uncorrelated (in the
United States, the correlation is even slightly negative). For
Turkey, the fit coefficients are below an acceptable level.
This is in part due to the small variance of the "belief in
God" variable (95% of the respondents believe in God; see
Table 3). Corresponding to the results of CFA, the reliability
test on the basis of Cronbach's alpha proves high internal
consistencies of the two religiousness scales with the excep-
tion of Turkey.
In the bottom part of Table 4, we also present the correla-
tion between subjective religiosity ("Would you describe
yourself as a religious person?") and the two scales. One can
see that considering oneself a religious person is much more
strongly associated with belief in God, prayer, and attend-
ance of religious services than with eastern beliefs. This is
the case in particular in the Christian countries Spain,
Germany, and the United States, but also in South Korea. In
the East Asian countries Japan and Taiwan, the difference is
less pronounced, but even here religiousness is more strongly
associated with the Western concept of religion than with the
characteristic beliefs of Eastern Asia.
Comparison of religiousness scales
from ISSP, WVS, and RM
In the following, we will compare the degree of religiosity in
our sample of countries according to the mean scores on the
religiosity scale and the eastern belief scale described above.
In addition, we will compare the results of the ISSP reli-
giousness scale with two religiousness scales derived from
the WVS and RM, in order to examine to what extent scales
that claim to measure the same construct in fact produce
similar results when applied to different countries. The
WVS-religiousness scale is composed of the same three
items as the ISSP religiousness scale, belief in God, fre-
quency of prayer, and frequency of attendance religious

services; however, the items have different answer categories
in the two studies. For the RM, we use the "centrality of reli-
gion" scale developed by Stefan Huber which is based on
Charles Glock's dimensional model of religion and claims to
measure the centrality of religion in people's life in a compa-
rable way across different religious cultures. For this pur-
pose, some of the indicators are formulated in a "theistic"
and in a "pantheistic" version; for those indicators that are
represented by two parallel items, the higher of two values is
used for the calculation of the scale score of a person (Huber,
2009; Huber and Huber, 2012). The short form of this scale
is composed of five items, each representing one dimension
of religiousness: belief in God or something divine (belief
dimension), frequency of participation in a public religious
ritual (public practice), (maximum value of) frequency of
prayer or frequency of meditation (private practice), fre-
quency of thinking about religion (cognitive dimension), and
(maximum value of) frequency of "having the feeling that
God intervenes in one's life" or "having the feeling to be one
with all" (experience dimension).
The results presented in Figure 2 correspond to the propor-
tion of respondents in the single countries who have scores
above the scale median of the combined dataset. In the follow-
ing, these persons will be referred to as religious. The findings
can be summarized as follows: For seven of the nine countries,
Germany, the United States, Turkey, South Korea, Thailand,
Taiwan, and Japan, the two religiousness scales derived from
the ISSP and the WVS and the centrality of religion scale from
the RM give rather similar results (differences amount to less
than 10%). For Spain and Russia, the differences are some-
what larger: According to the ISSP scale, 48% of the Spanish
respondents are religious; according to the WVS scale, only
35% are religious. For Russia, the discrepancies between the
three studies are larger: Here, the "centrality of religion" scale
of the RM determines a clearly lower proportion of religious
respondents (23%) than the religiousness scales of ISSP(35%)
and WVS (48%). The plausibility of these results can be
checked by considering other religiousness indicators reported
earlier in this article. Tables 2 and 3 show that the proportion
of persons consider themselves as religious, as well as the pro-
portion of those who believe in angels, demons, and hell is
somewhat higher in Russia than in Germany and Spain. Thus,
the results of the religion scales of ISSP and WVS for Russia
seem to be more plausible than the result of the "centrality of
religion" scale of the RM.
According to the assumptions of comparative religious
studies, one should expect that belief in reincarnation,
Nirvana, and spiritual presence of ancestors is more wide-
spread in East Asian countries than in monotheistic cultures.
This assumption is only partly confirmed by the ISSP data.
Japan and Thailand, two countries that are shaped by Taoist
and Buddhist traditions, in fact have clearly higher scores on
the eastern belief scale than the Christian countries Spain,
Germany, Russia, and the United States. Turkey, however,
has the highest mean score on this scale among all countries,
and the score for South Korea is similar to that of the United
States and Russia. It has to be assumed that these discrepan-
cies are primarily due to measurement errors, the formula-
tion of items, and different understanding of the meaning of
these concepts in the participating countries.
In Japan and Taiwan, the country mean scores on the
eastern belief scale are significantly higher than the scores

on the religiousness scale. This finding suggests that the
level of religiosity in Eastern Asian countries is underesti-
mated when the measurement of religiosity is based only on
indicators that are particularly characteristic of monotheis-
tic cultures (belief in God, regular attendance of commu-
nity rituals, and regular prayer). Also, Thailand has
relatively low scores on the religiousness scale, similar to
the scores in the highly secularized European countries of
Germany and Spain. The validity of this result is question-
able: Country reports and qualitative studies on the reli-
gious culture of Thailand show that Thai religion is
characterized by the strong presence of a syncretism of
Buddhist and indigenous shamanic traditions (Kittiarsa,
2005). The high number (93%) of Thai respondents in the
RM who indicated to own a private shrine (see Table 3) cor-
responds to this image. It seems that the religiousness
scales of WVS and RM do not capture this aspect of reli-
giousness sufficiently. (The eastern belief items were not
asked in these studies; presumably, Thailand would have
similarly high scores on this scale than Japan and Taiwan.)
South Korea has relatively low mean scores both on the
religiousness scale and on the eastern belief scale. In view of
the dynamic process of economic modernization, it seems
plausible that this country has undergone a similarly strong
process of secularization as the highly developed Western
countries. However, there exists a caveat against such an
interpretation: During the last decades, a considerable pro-
portion (around 40%) of South Koreans have converted to
Christianity. According to a report of the Pew Forum, a con-
siderable part of the Christians in South Korea belong to
Pentecostal or charismatic churches.3 A number of scholars
argue that such forms of ecstatic religiousness can prosper
only in societies where they are nourished by autochthonous
spiritualist traditions. This is definitely the case for South
Korea (Höllinger, 2009; Kim, 2000; Martin, 2001). Thus,
one should assume that also in South Korea, a certain type of
religiousness has not been captured with the survey scales.
Conclusion and outlook
In this article, we investigated the measurement of religious-
ness in three cross-national comparative surveys, the ISSP,
WVS, and RM. In the first step, we demonstrated that the
challenge of functional equivalence starts with the formula-
tion of apparently simple questions, such as the question of
religious affiliation. The comparison of the self-assessment
of religious affiliation in the three surveys shows that in
some countries the results depend to a considerable extent on
the details of the formulation of the question. For Japan,
Taiwan, and Russia, we found large differences between the
results of the surveys which seem to be due to the ambiguity
of the concept of religious affiliation in East Asian countries
and the culture-specific degree of social desirability of reli-
gious self-declaration.Also in regard to the core indicators of
religiousness, attendance of religious service, prayer, and
belief in God, the three surveys exhibit different results for a
part of the countries. Here, it is difficult to decide whether
the discrepancies are due to differences in the formulation of
the question and the number and formulation of answer cat-
egories or differences in the sampling and fieldwork proce-
dures. This problem is also due to insufficient documentation
of questionnaire translations.
In the core section of this article, we have shown by
single-country CFAs for a set of variables taken from ISSP

2008 that a two-factor solution that distinguishes "religious-
ness" and "eastern beliefs" fits the data significantly better
than a one-factor solution. These scales also have a high
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for all countries
except for Turkey. The analysis also indicates that the subjec-
tive concept of "being religious" is more strongly associated
with the Western concept of religiousness (belief in God,
attending religious service, and praying) than with eastern
religious beliefs, not only in Western but also in Eastern
countries. The RM has tried to overcome the problem of
measuring religion across different culture areas by means of
a scale that includes theistic and pantheistic (or non-theistic)
forms of religiosity. However, this methodology yielded
doubtful results in some respects: Thus, for example, the pro-
portion of respondents considered as religious in the panthe-
istic sense (i.e. persons who meditate and experience to be
"one with all") according to this scale is clearly higher in the
United States and Spain than in Thailand and South Korea.
Summarizing our findings, we can say that the paradigm
of cross-national comparative survey research of "asking the
same questions" is difficult to apply and problematic with
respect to the topic of religiosity. Also, the idea of comparing
the level of religiousness of countries belonging to different
culture areas by a single scale that is supposed to include all
dimensions of religiosity falls short. Our finding that the
concept of "being religious" is much more strongly associ-
ated with theistic (Western) forms of religion than with
Eastern religious beliefs both in Western and in Eastern
countries confirms Fitzgerald's assertion that non-Western
societies have adopted the Western concept of religion
(Fitzgerald, 2000) and do not include traditional beliefs and
rituals of their own culture into this concept. From this, it
follows that questionnaires which are based on the Western
concept of religion will lead to biased results when applied to
worldwide cross-cultural comparison. The participation of
scientists from different cultural contexts in the process of
questionnaire construction is an essential strategy to prevent
such biases. However, this procedure also cannot guarantee
cross-cultural content validity. For a deeper understanding of
comparative survey results, it is also highly important to con-
sider the countries not only as variables but to interpret and
question the findings on the basis of a profound knowledge
of their culture and history.

Notes
1. In order to examine to what extent the results differ depend-
ing on the operationalization of certain issues, we considered
only those countries in which at least two of the three surveys
World Values Survey (WVS) 2010­2014, International Social
Survey Programme (ISSP) 2008, and Religion Monitor (RM)
2008 were carried out; by this criterion, the number of avail-
able countries was reduced considerably.
2. For Russia, it was not possible to calculate confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) on a comparable basis with the other countries
because prayer was not asked about in ISSP 2008.
