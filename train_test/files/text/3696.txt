Introduction
A profound revolution based on information and knowl-
edge is occurring within society, which is led by develop-
ments in computing and communications technology.
According to Drucker (1993, p 07), "We are entering (or
have entered) the knowledge society where the knowledge
worker will play a central role." Knowledge leaders play a
vital role in enhancing research and curriculum develop-
ment (CD) in educational institutes. Over the years, an
organization's employees attain knowledge while perform-
ing their specific tasks. This knowledge resides in their
minds and has not been put in structured, documented based
form. The knowledge has been acquired along the years
while taking the decisions in crucial situations, solving the
problems. It is one of the most difficult task to transfer this
knowledge to others but, however, this knowledge is one of
the most valuable asset for any organization to lose.
Knowledge management (KM) facilitates the retention and
distribution of knowledge within an organization to gain
competitive advantage. Organizations are implementing
KM to reserve and utilize this knowledge.
KM is a broad concept that addresses the full range of
processes by which an organization deploys knowledge.
These involve the acquisition, retention, storage, distribu-
tion, and use of knowledge in an organization.
The basic components of educational institutions are CD
and research and human resource, namely, the knowledge
workers can play a vital role for improving CD and research.
The growth in the number of internet users has given an
added impetus to globalization. Information patterns have
transformed the electronic information systems by the use of
cyber technologies. As a result of this, knowledge transmis-
sion patterns within academic organizations must develop
and change the education systems for information to be
effectively transmitted. Consequently, KM method

Knowledge Management: Role of
Thought Leaders and Junior Academia in
Enhancing Research and Curriculum in
Institutions of Higher Technical Education
Ravi Kiran1, Parul D. Agarwal2, and Anil K. Verma1
Abstract
The present study covers the knowledge management (KM) in institutions of higher technical education (IHTEs) from
the perspective of thought leaders and junior academia to identify whether there is a difference of opinion regarding
KM strategies, including knowledge technologies, knowledge acquisition, knowledge storage, knowledge dissemination,
and KM-based framework for research and curriculum development (CD). Data have been collected through structured
questionnaire from 141 respondents covering 30 higher educational institutions in India, including national- and state-level
institutions--Designations of the targeted respondents in the IHTEs have been categorized into (a) senior academia, that is,
professors, heads, and associate professors occupying senior management positions, considered to be the institute overseers
and thought leaders of KM and (b) junior academia consisting of assistant professors and lecturers who are using and also
contributing to the KM system. ANOVA has been used to see whether there is a significant difference of opinion among the
two groups of knowledge users. The results of the study highlight a significant difference among the two groups regarding
knowledge technologies, knowledge acquisition, knowledge storage, and knowledge dissemination. But, there is a consensus
regarding KM-based framework for research and CD.

is becoming a perfect education development pool for all
academic levels (Thitithananon & Klaewthanong, 2007).
The present study based on the survey of academia of institu-
tion of higher technical education (IHTE) tries to identify the
key KM strategies acceptable to the two groups of knowl-
edge users--the senior academia, namely, professors, associ-
ate professors, and the thought leaders of KM, and junior
academia consisting of assistant professors and lecturers.
The study also tries to identify the key factors for KM-based
portal for CD and research.
Literature Review
The forces of technology, globalization, and the emerging
knowledge economy are creating a revolution that is forcing
organizations to change. The knowledge revolution has
invaded India, and higher education institutions are recog-
nized to be in the knowledge business. The higher educa-
tionalinstitutesarebeingincreasinglyexposedtomarketplace
pressures and have to focus on new competitive strategies to
remain ahead. Drucker (1993) has described knowledge,
rather than capital or labor, as the only meaningful economic
resource in the knowledge society. Thus, there is a need to
focus on knowledge and KM. Organizations that succeed in
KM are likely to view knowledge as an asset and to develop
organizational norms and values that support the creation
and sharing of knowledge (Davenport, DeLong, & Beers,
1998). KM is generally about the gathering, storing, dissemi-
nating, and application of knowledge via the know-how and
creation of work by the individuals in an organization (Miller,
1999). KM as a discipline encourages a mutually supported
method to create, capture, organize, and use information
(Bair, 1999; Duffy, 2000). This includes information that is
easily measurable as well as more difficult to measure infor-
mation that is either unspoken or informal.
Knowledge is a gradual transition from data to informa-
tion. According to Japanese author Nonaka (1994) with
enough preparation, we should be able to tap into that reser-
voir--and ride the wave--by utilizing new ways to channel
raw data into meaningful information. That information, in
turn, can then become the knowledge that leads to wisdom.
Information is a relationship between data and, quite simply,
what it is, with great dependence on context for its meaning
and with little implication for the future (Alberthal, 1995;
David, 2000).
KM is defined as the process of transforming information
and intellectual assets into enduring value. KM connects
people with the knowledge that they need to take action
when they need it (Kidwell, Karen, & Johnson, 2000). KM
consists of explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge (Tiwana,
2000). KM is generally about the gathering, storing, dissemi-
nating, and application of knowledge via the know-how and
creation of work by the individuals in an organization (Miller,
1999). Knowledge refers to the sum of what is known: A
familiarity, awareness, or understanding gained through
experience that, in a business context, guide operations and
administrativeprocesses(Coukos&Eleni,2003).Knowledge
represents a pattern that connects and generally provides a
high level of predictability, for example, if the humidity is
very high and the temperature drops substantially, the atmo-
sphere is often unlikely to be able to hold the moisture, so it
rains (Bateson, 1988).
A common way to discuss knowledge is by dividing it
into two dimensions, explicit knowledge and tacit knowl-
edge. Explicit knowledge can be expressed in words and
numbers and is shared in the form of data, manuals, copy-
right, and patents (Nonaka, 1991; Smith, 2001). The advan-
tage of this type of knowledge is that it is easily accessible
for other people, and can therefore be reused to solve similar
problems (Smith, 2001). Explicit knowledge is documented
information that can facilitate action. It can be expressed in
formal, shared language (Kidwell et al., 2000).
Tacit knowledge is often seen as the iceberg below the
surface of the water, that is, unseen and embedded in our
social identity and practice (Spender, 1996). Tacit knowl-
edge is deeply rooted in actions and experiences as well as in
the ideals, values, or emotions that an individual embraces
(Nonaka & Nishiguchi, 2001). Most business actions require
the guidance of explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge
(Kidwell et al., 2000).
Management consulting firms, which are considered as
knowledge-based companies, have a high level of interest in
KM because their capacity to compete on the basis of accu-
mulated knowledge is important for their industry (Dunford,
2000).
The management consulting industry has experienced a
constant growth during the 20th century (David, 2000). The
ultimate goal for a company is to ensure that the knowledge
"does not go home at night," that is, knowledge should
become a part of the organization as a whole (Kreiner, 2002).
The aim of KM, for an organization, is to create a capable
organization that measures, stores, and turns knowledge into
a capital, in other words, to create a learning organization
(Bollinger & Smith, 2001). Researchers claim that the key
for this process of making individual knowledge a part of the
organization is personal commitment (Goh, 2002; Nonaka,
1994).
KM and Higher Education
KM in education can therefore be thought of as a framework
or an approach that enables people within the institution to
develop a set of practices to collect information and share
what they know leading to actions that improve services and
outcomes (Petrides & Nodine, 2003).
Implementing KM practices wisely is what smartest orga-
nizations are learning all over again (Kidwell et al., 2000).
According to Coukos and Eleni (2003), in business sector,
knowledge is now being perceived as a valuable asset.
Organizational knowledge refers to knowledge of the overall
Kiran et al. 3
business the organization is in, the organization's strengths
and weaknesses, the markets it serves, and the factors critical
to organizational success. Universities also rely on faculty-
generated knowledge and traditional means of discovery and
transmission of knowledge. KM in higher education supplies
us with a framework for understanding how good assessment
practice, in fact, depends on effective information system
(Kumar & Kumar, 2005).
KM system can create a common gateway to the data,
information, and knowledge. People throughout the higher
educational institutions need to effectively share information
and work together on projects. When employees use KM sys-
tem, best practices are stored throughout the organization,
and each employee accessing the system has power similar to
the best employee (Markus, 2002). In academia, most of the
tacit knowledge associated with an area of study lies with the
faculty who study it. The tacit knowledge of literature may be
what characterizes much of the informal, side-conversations
at academic conferences, in discussions between graduate
students and their mentors (Hawkins, 2000).
The objectives of the present study are to
·
· identify the key KM strategies acceptable to the two
groups of knowledge users--the senior academia,
namely, professors, associate professors, the thought
leaders of KM, and junior academia consisting of
assistant professors and lecturers, regarding KM
strategies;
·
· identify the key factors for KM-based portal for CD
acceptable to senior and junior academia;
·
· identify the key factors for KM-based portal for
research acceptable to senior and junior academia;
and
·
· assess the benefits of the proposed KM framework for
CD and research.
Design and Method
Data have been collected through a survey questionnaire
based on Likert-type scale and supported by personal inter-
views. The questionnaire has been designed according to the
following research objectives and it contains these sections:
1. Information and communication technologies (ICTs)
status of IHTE
2. KM implementation and knowledge-based techno-
logies
3. KM portal for CD
4. Benefits of KM-based portal for CD
5. KM portal for research
6. Benefits of KM-based portal for research.
As seen from the results, the Cronbach's alpha values
vary from .770 to .897 and overall reliability is .874.
Reliability depicts internal consistency of questionnaire.
According to Nunally (1978), the generally accepted
standard for reliability estimates are values greater than .70.
Thus, the results highlight the internal consistency of the
questionnaire (see Table 1).
Results and Findings
ICT Scenario and Need for ICT
The initial part of research focused on knowing the ICT
infrastructure of the institutions (see Table 2).
Regarding ICT status of IHTEs surveyed, there was
almost consensus among the senior and junior academia
regarding ICT skills and applications needed to keep the
pace with world in the knowledge age and this got the first
rank. The usage of ICT to improve knowledge sharing among
educator and students was placed at second rank. There was
a difference of opinion regarding whether educators could
use the new technology to improve their teaching, to give it
more variety, for example, PowerPoint shows, web discus-
sions, uniform resource locator (URL) collections, and web-
sites. As most of the institutions are in the implementation
stage of KM and have not switched to complete KM adop-
tion, the levels of infrastructure at many IHTEs could be a
reason for this.
KM Policies
Before turning to KM portal for research and CD, it is essen-
tial to know about the institute culture toward KM strategies.
Regarding KM system in IHTEs, topmost priority by junior
and senior academia has been given to values system or cul-
ture intended to promote knowledge sharing, followed by
using partnerships or strategic alliances to acquire knowl-
edge. Least priority has been given to rewarding the employ-
ees monetarily or nonmonetarily (see Table 3).
Knowledge Acquisition
IHTEs by nature are the power house of knowledge. The
organization should make an effort to acquire explicit

knowledge and tacit knowledge that exists inside and out-
side the IHTE. It can be accomplished by dedicating
resources to detect and obtain external knowledge. IHTE's
interest to acquire knowledge and methods used is investi-
gated to find out whether there is an acceptance regarding
knowledge acquisition among the senior and junior aca-
demia (see Table 4).
Hypothesis 1: There is a significant difference among the
senior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-
sors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia
consisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-
ing KM acquisition.
For KM strategies, knowledge technologies, knowledge
acquisition, knowledge storage, and knowledge dissemina-
tion of IHTEs have been considered.
ANOVA results for knowledge acquisition highlight that
there is a significant difference between senior and junior
academia, which is significant for all but one item of knowl-
edge acquisition.
Knowledge Storage
To utilize the acquired knowledge for future use, it should be
stored systematically. The study attempts to inquire whether
there is a difference in opinion of senior and junior academia
regarding the methods for storing knowledge (see Table 5).
Hypothesis 2: There is a significant difference among the
senior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-
sors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia
consisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-
ing knowledge storage.
For KM storage, there is a significant difference between
senior and junior academia regarding knowledge storage by
using the portal system. Knowledge storage by having the
department-wise database and knowledge storage by main-
taining "best practices and lessons learned" database are not
significant as seen from p ratio. Thus, the above hypothesis
has been partially accepted.
Knowledge Dissemination
The process described so far encompasses the collection and
storage of knowledge generated, information gathered, and
lessons learned to allow an organization to capitalize on its
experience and improve its performance. The stored knowl-
edge has to be disseminated effectively for sharing the ben-
efits. Knowledge can be shared in traditional ways and also
with technology-driven modes (see Table 6).
Hypothesis 3: There is a significant difference among the
senior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-
sors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia
consisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-
ing knowledge dissemination.
ANOVA results for job status and knowledge dissemina-
tion highlight that (a) regularly updating databases of good
work practices and lessons learned, (b) sharing via intranet
shows significant difference, and (c) knowledge sharing
committees. Thus for three items out of five, there is a

KM Technologies
The critical role that information technology (IT) can play
is in its ability to support communication, collaboration,
and those searching for knowledge and information
(McCampbell et al., 1999). IT and the advent of the per-
sonal computer have greatly enhanced organizational
effectiveness, interorganizational deployment, and cogni-
tive advance (Grover & Davenport, 2001). In the age of
technology, one has many options to opt from the available
ICTs. KM technologies considered in the present study are
as follows:
·
· Internet: It is a worldwide system of computer net-
works--A network of networks in which users at any
one computer can, if they have permission, get infor-
mation from any other computer.
·
· Intranet: It is a privately maintained computer net-
work that can be accessed only by authorized persons,
especially members or employees of the organization
that owns it.

·
· Extranet: It is an extension of an institution's intranet,
especially over the world wide web, enabling com-
munication between the institution and people it deals
with, often by providing limited access to its intranet.
·
· Data warehousing: It is a large specialized database,
holding perhaps hundreds of terabytes of data. A data-
base is specifically structured for information access
and reporting.
·
· Document management: It is the process of handling
documents in such a way that information can be cre-
ated, shared, organized, and stored efficiently and
appropriately.
·
· Blog: It is a frequent, chronological publication of
personal thoughts and web links.
·
· Decision support system (DSS): It is an interactive
software-based system intended to help decision mak-
ers compile useful information from raw data, docu-
ments, personal knowledge, and/or business models
to identify and solve problems and make decisions.
·
· Artificial intelligence (AI): It is the study and design
of intelligent agents where an intelligent agent is a
system that perceives its environment and takes
actions that maximize its chances of success.
·
· Groupware: It refers to programs that help people
work together collectively while located remotely
from each other. Groupware services can include the
sharing of calendars, collective writing, email han-
dling, shared database access, electronic meetings
with each person able to see and display information
to others, and other activities. Groupware provides a
mechanism that helps users coordinate and keep track
of ongoing projects together.
Hypothesis 4: There is a significant difference among the
senior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-
sors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia
consisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-
ing KM technologies.
ANOVA results highlight that there is a significant differ-
ence between senior and junior academia as regards five out
of eight KM technologies. These are (a) intranet (such as
internal portals), (b) document management, (c) blogs, (d)
DSS, and (e) groupware (see Table 7).
Thus, the present hypothesis has been accepted.
KM Framework for Research
The study considered opinions of senior and junior academia
on the following features for research framework:
·
· Research interests within an institution or affiliated
institutions
·
· Research results and funding organizations
·
· Commercial opportunities for research results
·
· Funding opportunities
·
· Prepopulated proposals, budgets, and protocols

Hypothesis 5: There is a significant difference among
the senior academia, namely, professors, associate
professors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior
academia consisting of assistant professors and
lecturers, regarding knowledge framework for
research.
ANOVA results highlight that there is no significant dif-
ference among the thought leaders and junior academia for
the features of KM-based portal for research. Thus, the above
hypothesis has not been accepted (see Table 8).
Thus, the next section of the survey related to finding out
from the academia the areas of education that will benefit the
most with the implementation of KM. The factor analysis
method has been applied on the data. Principal components
factor analysis with varimax rotation and Kaiser normaliza-
tion has been applied.
The results highlight three factors, namely (a) reduced
turnaround time and cost of research and administrative
tasks, (b) better curriculum and interdisciplinary research,
8 SAGE Open
and (c) improved services to cultivate future scientists'
account for 67.134 of total variance.
These factors are explained below:
Reduced turnaround time and cost of research and admin-
istrative tasks: This factor has emerged as a most
important factor with a total variance of 42.020. The
major components of this factor include the
following:
Reduced turnaround time for research (0.792)
Minimized devotion of research resources to administra-
tive tasks (0.808)
Reduced administrative costs (0.822).
Better curriculum and interdisciplinary research: This
factor has emerged as another important factor with a
total variance of 13.668. The major components of this
factor include the following:
Latest research can give good inputs to improve the CD
process (0.711)
Facilitation of interdisciplinary research (0.792)
Leveraging of previous research and proposal efforts
(0.688).
Improved services to cultivate future scientists: This fac-
tor has emerged as another important factor with a total
variance of 11.449. The major components of this fac-
tor include the following:

Hypothesis 6: There is a significant difference among the
senior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-
sors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia
consisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-
ing knowledge-based framework for CD.
The ANOVA results highlight that there is no signifi-
cant difference among the thought leaders and junior
faculty regarding the features for KM-based portal for CD
(see Table 10). Thus, the present hypothesis has not been
accepted.
Benefits of KM Portal for Curriculum
Thus, the next section of the survey related to finding out
from the academia that the areas of education will benefit the
most with the implementation of KM.
The factor analysis method has been applied on the data.
Principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation
and Kaiser normalization has been applied. The results high-
light that two factors, namely (a) curriculum improvisation
and (b) faculty development and reduced turnaround time of
CD account for 77.35 of total variance. These factors are
explained below:

Curriculum improvisation: This factor has emerged as a
most important factor with a total variance of 34.51.
The major components of this factor include the
following:
Good curriculum will enhance the research (0.882)
An industry oriented and latest curriculum will produce
competent professionals (0.763)
Enhanced quality of curriculum and programs by identi-
fying and leveraging best practices and monitoring
outcomes (0.816).
Faculty development and reduced turnaround time of CD:
This factor has emerged as another important factor
with a total variance of 32.37. The major components
of this factor include the following:
Improved speed of curriculum revision and updating
(0.727)
Enhanced faculty development efforts especially for the
new faculty (0.649)
Improved administrative services related to teaching and
learning with technology (0.805)
Improved responsiveness by monitoring and incorporat-
ing lessons learned (0.768)
Interdisciplinary curriculum design and development
(0.646).
The mean score of Factor 1--curriculum improvisation--
is 4.44, and the mean score of Factor 2--faculty develop-
ment and reduced turnaround time of CD--is 4.286, as is
explained in Table 11.
According to Kidwell et al. (2001), the KM portal can be
a gateway to research on the use of teaching and learning
through technology, professional development, policy devel-
opment and review, and resource development. The above
results of factor analysis based on the perception of academia
of IHTE support that KM portal for research will lead to bet-
ter curriculum and interdisciplinary research help in provid-
ing improved services to cultivate future scientists. These
two factors are important benefits of research. The last fac-
tor, that is, reduced turnaround time and cost of research and
administrative tasks, has lower mean compared with other
two factors and is relatively low on priority list of academia.
Thus, there has been an overwhelming support from the aca-
demia for the implementation of KM in research as seen
from the results of survey.

Conclusion
The first objective of the research has been to identify the key
KM strategies acceptable to the two groups of knowledge
users, the senior academia, namely, professors, associate
professors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia
consisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regarding
KM strategies. The results of the study highlight that there is
a significant difference among the two knowledge groups of
users, the senior academia/thought leaders and junior aca-
demia/followers, regarding knowledge technologies, knowl-
edge acquisition, knowledge storage, and knowledge
dissemination.
The next objective has been to identify the key factors for
KM-based portal for CD acceptable to senior and junior
academia. The results indicate that there is no significant dif-
ference regarding KM-based framework for CD.
The third objective has been to identify the key factors for
KM-based portal for research acceptable to senior and
junior academia. A positive finding has been that here also
the two groups have accepted the features of research to be
included in KM framework for research. Thus, the features
chosen by researchers for KM-based framework for CD and
research are acceptable to both the groups.
The last and most important objective has been to assess
the benefits of the proposed KM framework for CD and
research. The researchers also tried to assess the perceived
benefits of KM-based framework for CD and research.
Regarding CD benefits, curriculum improvisation and fac-
ulty development and reduced turnaround time of CD are
able to explain 77.35% of variation. Curriculum improvisa-
tion is considered more important as it has higher factor
loadings and mean. The results highlight three factors,
namely (a) reduced turnaround time and cost of research and
administrative tasks, (b) better curriculum and interdisciplin-
ary research, and (c) improved services to cultivate future
scientists' account for 67.134 of total variance. Better cur-
riculum and interdisciplinary research had higher loadings
and higher mean score than other factors and is thus more
important than other factors.
Significance of the Study
This study is useful for academicians as well as thought lead-
ers involved in policy making in academic institutions as it
relates to identifying the factors for research and curriculum
portal in IHTE. Dimensions used for knowledge acquisition,
knowledge storage, and knowledge dissemination have been
identified by the study. The study helps in analyzing the
important KM technologies used for KM sharing by existing
IHTE. The study is a successful attempt in revealing the fac-
tors of research and CD that require more attention for
knowledge sharing.
