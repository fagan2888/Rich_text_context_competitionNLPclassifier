Research Question
After the financial crisis monetary policy rates in the euro area were lowered continuously,
which curtailed the feasibility of rate cuts. In the absence of conventional monetary policy
instruments, the European Central Bank (ECB) has used a set of novel measures with
the aim to support lending to the real economy and, ultimately, to ensure price stability.
Among those measures, this study focuses on the economic effects of direct asset purchases.
Contribution
We estimate the dynamic effects of asset purchase programs. The key innovations of
our paper are twofold. First, we use a novel identification scheme to single out balance
sheet expansions related to asset purchase programs. Our identification assumptions do
not restrict the response of financial stress, as several papers in the literature do. We
use specific balance sheet items of the ECB in order to separate asset purchases from
demand-driven ECB balance sheet expansions. Second, we consider the responses of
several macroeconomic and financial variables, in the euro area and for Germany.
Results
Our research indicates that the financial market impact of the ECB's asset purchase
policies is less favorable than the macroeconomic one. The asset purchase programs raise
output in the euro area as a whole and in Germany, while consumer prices do not change
clearly. We find a reduction in financial market stress. This beneficial effect is, however,
overturned in the medium run. In Germany, loan rates do not decrease in response to
expansionary asset purchase policies; bank lending to firms does not expand.

Abstract
The European Central Bank's asset purchase programs, while intended to stabilize
the economy, may have unintended side effects on financial stability. This paper
aims at gauging the effects on financial markets, the banking sector, and lending
to non-financial firms. Using a structural vector autoregression analysis, we find
both in the euro area and in Germany a positive effect on output, while prices do
not respond significantly. Asset purchases reduce financial stress, but this beneficial
effect is overturned in the medium run. In Germany, implicit firm default rates rise,
while loan write-offs by banks decrease. This could point to an avoidance of balance
sheet repair in the financial sector.

1 Introduction
Our study contributes to the debate on the effectiveness of the ECB's policy actions in
terms of balance sheet expansions. We employ a vector autoregression (VAR) model
to estimate the dynamic effects of asset purchase programs on the macroeconomy and
financial markets. The identification strategy we propose is novel in the literature and
well-suited to consider possible side effects on financial markets. Compared to existing
empirical studies, our approach is explicitly agnostic about the effects of policy measures
on financial markets because we refrain from restricting the respective responses ex ante.
Recent economic developments within the euro area macroeconomy have led the Eu-
ropean Central Bank (ECB) and the Eurosystem1 to develop new tools in order to fulfill
their mandate and keep inflation stable. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in
September 2008, financial markets in many countries experienced turbulent times, impair-
ing bank lending and monetary policy transmission. Due to increased uncertainty, the
interbank market was disrupted, which induced liquidity stress for the banking system.2
Bank lending to non-financial firms declined, which had severe consequences for the real
economy. Output dropped sharply and inflation rates fell below the ECB's definition of
price stability. In a situation with policy rates approaching the zero lower bound, the
ECB had to consider new measures, among which it implemented several asset purchase
programs and other lending schemes in the following years aiming to provide banks with
liquidity and to improve bank lending. The euro area sovereign debt crisis emerged in
late 2009, which again induced pressure on financial markets and made new policy actions
necessary.
While the transmission channel of conventional interest rate policy is well understood
and many ­ empirical as well as theoretical ­ studies exist on that topic, the effects of the
diverse set of unconventional measures, of which balance sheet policy is one particular
example, are still being explored. There is, as yet, no consensus to what extent those
measures are effective in bringing inflation and output back to their target levels, or
whether any unintended side effects unfold particularly within financial markets.
There is a small but growing literature on the effects of non-standard policies on
the macroeconomy.3 Some studies approach the question with event studies like Eser
and Schwaab (2016), who show that the Securities Market Programme (SMP) had a
significant impact on sovereign bond yields. They consider common factors to control
for aggregate developments. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) show that in
the US, the quantitative easing programs QE1 and QE2 were both effective in lowering
nominal interest rates, but the magnitude of the effect differs across asset classes. Lambert
and Ueda (2014) consider US banks and their reaction to policy news. They do not find
a positive effect on bank returns, while bank credit risk increases over the medium term.
Szczerbowicz (2015) shows the effectiveness of different unconventional measures in the
euro area. In particular, the interconnectedness between banks and sovereigns amplifies

abbreviation for the institutions responsible for monetary policy decisions in the euro area.

the effect of policy announcements.
While those studies distinguish specific purchase programs and focus an impact ef-
fects, they cannot estimate a dynamic effect on the aggregate economy. In this respect,
Casiraghi, Gaiotti, Rodano, and Secchi (2013) use a combination of two strategies. They
investigate the effects of the SMP, Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) and Longer
Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) within an event study. Subsequently, they feed
their results into a macroeconomic model of the Italian economy. They find that the SMP
as well as the OMTs were effective in decreasing government bond yields, while LTROs
improved lending conditions. K¨
uhl (2016) shows in a DSGE analysis that government
bond purchases are beneficial with respect to economic activity especially if financial fric-
tions are more "severe". Lenza, Pill, and Reichlin (2010) estimate a Bayesian VAR model
and compute counterfactual developments of key macroeconomic variables. They show
that monetary policy in exceptional times, represented by central bank liquidity man-
agement, is effective. Notably, their analysis refers to the fixed rate full allotment policy
of the ECB and therefore highlights demand-driven liquidity provisioning of the banking
system. Gambacorta, Hofmann, and Peersman (2014) apply a mean group estimator to a
cross-country VAR model to show that balance sheet expansions have a positive effect on
output and prices. They consider information from eight currency areas, which helps them
to overcome the problem of a relatively short sample. Peersman (2011) compares con-
ventional interest rate policy responses to unconventional balance sheet policy. He finds
that both measures have a positive effect on output and prices, while the transmission of
a balance sheet expansion is more sluggish. However, the analysis cannot distinguish ex-
ogenous policy shocks from endogenous demand-driven effects originating in the banking
sector. Similarly, Darracq Pari`
es and De Santis (2013) use information in the Bank Lend-
ing Survey in order to compute dynamic effects of a credit supply shock. They show that
the ECB's 3-year LTRO program from December 2011 is expansionary with respect to
output and inflation. Bluwstein and Canova (2016) find important cross-country spillover
effects of unconventional policy measures taken by the ECB.
Our analysis is related to the work of Peersman (2011), Gambacorta et al. (2014),
and Boeckx, Dossche, and Peersman (2017), who investigated the effects of balance sheet
shocks at an aggregate level. In particular, Boeckx et al. (2017) set up a VAR model and
consider the dynamic effects of the ECB's balance sheet policies. Their analysis focuses
on non-financial macroeconomic developments. They show that an increase in the ECB
balance sheet has a positive effect on output, prices, and bank lending. In general, they
find favorable macroeconomic effects, with heterogeneity among euro area countries. To
identify an expansionary balance sheet shock, they impose a negative reaction of euro area
financial stress. Weale and Wieladek (2016) identify an `asset purchase announcement
shock' (as opposed to an uncertainty shock) by requiring real stock prices to rise.
Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we use a novel identification strat-
egy for the policy shock. It requires an ECB balance sheet expansion through particular
balance sheet items but is agnostic with respect to financial market variables. Since
we are particularly interested in the response of financial stress, we do not restrict this
variable in our identification scheme. We find favorable effects of balance sheet policies
with respect to financial stress and output within the first year. Thereafter, the effect on
output vanishes, while financial stress increases above its pre-shock level. The identified
effect on prices is subject to a high degree of uncertainty; impulse responses can hardly
2
be distinguished from zero. Output, inflation and financial stress respond much more
strongly to a financial stress shock than to an asset purchase shock.
Second, we add to the literature a country-specific impact study, with a focus on
the German economy. Krishnamurthy, Nagel, and Vissing-Jorgensen (2014) have shown
that the ECB's SMP and OMT were successful in reducing government bond yields in
periphery countries. We show that macroeconomic effects in Germany are similar to
those in the euro area as a whole: output rises, while prices do not respond. Financial
stress, however, falls only initially. Over the medium run, the composite stress indicator
actually increases, together with market risk aversion. While corporate lending does not
increase significantly, implicit default rates rise and write-offs go down, which may reflect
an increase in risky lending as banks avoid writing off questionable loans.4
We note that our approach, which focuses on macroeconomic time series data, applies
to lower frequencies and therefore generally does not pick up announcement effects that
might be visible at higher frequencies. However, as pointed out by Bluwstein and Canova
(2016), event studies which employ high-frequency data cannot capture macroeconomic
effects. Data may be more noisy, which potentially affects results.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our data set
and gives a brief outline of the recent policy measures in the euro area. Section 3 describes
the econometric framework, as well as our identifying assumptions. The estimation results
are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.
2 Data and the ECB balance sheet
We use time series data from July 2009 until March 2016. The short time period makes it
necessary to consider monthly observations in order to have sufficient information available
to estimate the VAR model. While there exist monthly data before July 2009, it is
important for our analysis to focus on the particular episode where the ECB injected
liquidity through asset purchase programs. The following paragraph gives a short overview
of the recent actions undertaken in response to the financial crisis and the European
sovereign debt crisis.5 Figure 1 shows the evolution of the ECB's balance sheet item
"securities held for monetary policy purposes" (SHMPP), which comprises assets affected
by the purchase programs, as well as the sum of main refinancing operations (MROs)
and longer term refinancing operations (LTROs). This distinction of balance sheet items
is central for our structural shock identification as it helps us to distinguish exogenous
policy measures from endogenous balance sheet expansions.
During the sample period, the ECB conducted several asset purchase programs in
order to stabilize bank lending and to maintain a functioning monetary transmission
mechanism. The ECB argues that purchase programs aim to bring inflation back to
levels comformable with the definition of price stability.6 Consequently, the effect on
prices and output should appropriately reflect the effectiveness of the new measure. At

the same time, they may have desired or undesired effects on financial stress, which are
of interest.
In July 2009, the Eurosystem central banks started to buy covered bonds, which, as
argued by the ECB, are an important source for banks' refinancing. The total aggregate
value of the purchase program was 60 billion euros. Even though the first Covered Bond
Purchase Programme (CBPP1) ended in June 2010, there is still a significant fraction of
those assets on the ECB balance sheet.
In May 2010, the Eurosystem started the SMP where it bought securities for 230 billion
euros. The second Covered Bond Purchase Programme (CBPP2) was conducted between
November 2011 and October 2012. Bonds worth a total of 16 billion euros were purchased.
In November 2014, national central banks started the Asset-Backed Securities Purchase
Programme (ABSPP). One month later, the third Covered Bonds Purchase Programme
(CBPP3) was introduced and proposed to be conducted until June 2016. Finally, in March
2015 the Public Sector Purchase Programme was launched. The Eurosystem planned to
buy a monthly aggregate volume of 60 billion euros under the ABSPP, the CBPP3 and
the PSPP. The PSPP represents the most important component of the Asset Purchase
Programme (APP), which was raised by 20 billion euros in April 2016. Since June 2016,
the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme has been appended to the APP. In December
2016, the Eurosystem decided to switch back to a monthly volume of 60 billion euros in
April 2017.
Prior to these measures, the ECB announced a fixed rate full allotment policy in
October 2008. At a predetermined interest rate, it allows banks to obtain as much liquidity
as needed, given adequate collateral. The full allotment policy aims at improving the
liquidity position of banks and it works through MROs and LTROs. One may argue that
during the time frame considered, MROs and LTROs can, to some extent, be regarded as
unconventional policy measures as well, especially because of the full allotment policy. Our
analysis distinguishes asset purchase programs from other unconventional policy measures.
With respect to the aforementioned measures, we separate two types of instruments
that affect the balance sheet of the ECB through different positions. We label the first
4
one direct asset purchases. This shock induces an expansion of the ECB balance sheet
item "Securities Held for Monetary Policy Purposes",while it does not positively affect
main- and longer term refinancing operations. The second represents endogenous liquid-
ity provisioning and induces expansions of the balance sheet items "Main Refinancing
Operations" and "Longer Term Refinancing Operations". While the first instrument is
used by the central bank in a discretionary fashion, the second adjusts to the liquidity
demand of the financial sector and is therefore endogenous. The distinction is crucial for
our identification scheme, which we explain in Section 3.2. In general, the aim of the as-
set purchase programs was to encourage bank lending in order to repair the transmission
channel of monetary policy and ultimately to bring inflation back to a value of below (but
close to) 2%.7
For the baseline specification of the VAR model we consider the MRO rate to represent
the conventional monetary policy instrument. The monthly data frequency does not
allow us to directly use GDP as a measure of output or economic activity. We instead
interpolate the quarterly series using the Chow and Lin (1971) method on the basis of the
monthly industrial production index.8 Euro area prices are measured by the harmonized
index of consumer prices (HICP); for Germany, we use the consumer price index (CPI).
In order to measure financial stress in the euro area, we use the Composite Indicator
of Systemic Stress (CISS) proposed by Holl´
o, Kremer, and Lo Duca (2012), while for
the German case we use the comparable Bundesbank Stress Indicator for the German
Financial System. Most of the data are publicly available, where the main data sources
are the ECB Statistical Data Warehouse (SDW) and the Bundesbank.9 More detailed
information on the data is provided in Table A.1 of the Appendix.
3 VAR Model
We analyze the effects of monetary policy with a vector autoregression model, where we
employ a novel set of identifying assumptions on the asset purchase shock. The VAR
allows us to model the effects of shocks dynamically, while imposing a minimum set of
assumptions about the structure of the economy.
3.1 Specification
Let us first consider the following reduced form VAR system,
yt
= c1
+ c2
t +
p

j=1
Bj
yt-j
+ ut
, with t = 1, . . . , T, (1)
where yt
is an N × 1 vector of endogenous variables, ut
 N(0, ) is an N × 1 vector of
reduced form residuals, c1
is an N × 1 intercept vector, c2
is an N × 1 coefficient vector
on the linear time trend, and Bj
are N × N matrices containing the VAR coefficients.
7See e.g. https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html.
8We want to keep our estimation results comparable to the literature and therefore follow Boeckx
et al. (2017) and Gambacorta et al. (2014) in this respect.
9Data on the Stress Indicator for the German Financial System, presented in Bundesbank (2013, p.
7­20), is not publicly available.
5
In order to generate results comparable to the literature, we opted for a lag length of
p = 4.10 We propose the following selection of endogenous variables:
yt
=
[
rt
yt
pt
st
xt
lt
]

, (2)
where rt
denotes the policy rate, yt
denotes output, pt
denotes the price index, st
denotes
the central bank assets held for monetary policy purposes, xt
is an indicator of financial
stress or another financial market variable, and lt
is the sum of MRO and LTRO volumes.
All variables, except for the policy rate and financial stress, are in logarithms.
To conduct a structural analysis, we identify the following model,
A0
yt
= a1
+ a2
t +
p

j=1
Aj
yt-j

with et
 N(0, IN
), IN
is the N × N identity matrix and E(ut
u
t
) = (A
0
A0
)-1 = 
is the covariance matrix of the VAR residuals. Since the estimated model (1) does not
allow us to identify the structural form (3) without additional assumptions, we impose
identifying restrictions on the impulse response functions (IRFs) of shocks. The literature
has developed several methods to determine A0
based on economic considerations. We
identify the shocks using a combined sign and zero restrictions approach and rely on the
method of Arias, Rubio-Ramirez, and Waggoner (2014), who propose an algorithm which
is robust to erroneous credible intervals and unintended additional sign restrictions.11
3.2 Identification
The literature has developed different identifying assumptions on the asset purchase shock.
Given the ECB's switch to fixed rate full allotment provisioning during the considered
time frame, banks can in principle obtain as much liquidity as they need at a given interest
rate. Both exogenous balance sheet policy decisions and higher liquidity demand by banks
lead to an expansion of the central bank balance sheet. Similarly, Szczerbowicz (2015)
discriminates between "asset purchases" and "other exceptional liquidity provisions". In
contrast, Peersman (2011) does not distinguish demand-driven expansions from asset pur-
chase programs. He argues that even though a balance sheet expansion is demand-driven,
the policy decision to provide the banking sector with as much liquidity as needed when
financial stress occurs, is still taken by the ECB and as such represents a policy deci-
sion. Boeckx et al. (2017) and Gambacorta et al. (2014) use variables which indicate
financial stress periods or periods with high risk aversion in order to ensure exogeneity
of their policy shock. They require those measures to be non-increasing if an expansion-
ary unconventional shock hits the economy. This assumption excludes demand-induced
balance sheet expansions which occur in stress periods but it precludes the authors from
10Throughout the analysis and across different specifications, we keep the specification comparable by
using the same lag length. Robustness checks with different lag lengths showed similar results, see section
B.2 in the Appendix.
11Arias et al. (2014) show that other algorithms may lead to additional sign restrictions on variables
which are seemingly unrestricted. Consequently, point estimates and confidence bands are estimated with
error.

interpreting the responses to stress itself.
In order to investigate the effects of a discretionary asset purchase shock, it has to be
defined and identified unambiguously. In particular, the shock should be orthogonal to
other possible shocks in the system. We impose a mixture of sign and zero restrictions on
the impulse responses of certain variables in our VAR model. Our identifying restrictions
are summarized in Table 1.
For our analysis, we consider asset purchases associated with expansions of the ECB
balance sheet.12 In particular, we require securities held for monetary policy purposes (st
)
to increase if an expansionary asset purchase shock hits the economy. The literature on
monetary policy transmission traditionally assumes that output (yt
) and prices (pt
) are not
contemporaneously affected by the policy measure. In the same vein, it can be argued that
a discretionary expansion of the central bank's balance sheet should not change output and
prices on impact. As discussed above, the ECB's fixed rate full allotment policy requires
us to distinguish the asset purchase shock from a demand-driven balance sheet expansion.
Generally, a policy-induced increase in the balance sheet can be attributed either to the
endogenous response of liquidity demand lt
or to an exogenous asset purchase shock st
.13
In order to make sure that our asset purchase shock is truly exogenous and does not reflect
an endogenous response through a sort of "balance sheet rule", we impose an additional
restriction. Since demand-driven balance sheet expansions operate through either MROs
or LTROs, we require the sum of the two, lt
, not to increase. The restriction on the
MRO and LTRO volumes is a convenient way to identify the shock without restricting
the responses of financial stress. The policy rate rt
does not react when an asset purchase
shock hits the system.14
For comparison, we also identify a financial shock that increases stress on financial
markets xt
. Differently from the asset purchase shock, banks are assumed to increase
the ECB's balance sheet through either MROs and LTROs or SHFMPP, while the policy
instrument remains unrestricted. Output and prices are sluggish and do not react contem-
poraneously to the shock. We interpret the dynamic responses to this shock as picking up
endogenous reactions to financial stress periods, which includes effects of the ECB's fixed
12We abstract from other unconventional measures, such as loosening of collateral requirements, lower
reserve requirements, maturity transformations of refinancing operations, or forward guidance.
13Other balance sheet items are less relevant for our analysis.
14The chosen sample period is well-suited to analyze asset purchase shocks while it seems not sensible
to identify conventional policy rate shocks. However, for illustrative purposes we simulated responses to
a policy rate shock within our sample. Results can be found in section B.3 in the Appendix.

rate full allotment policy. As we impose banks to demand liquidity through MROs and
LTROs in response to the shock, the dynamics allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of
those measures. Gambacorta et al. (2014) and Boeckx et al. (2017) identify their version
of a balance sheet shock by excluding endogenous reactions to stress which we capture in
the financial shock. In this spirit, Lenza et al. (2010), focus on effects of those endogenous
and demand-driven measures which should not be confused with the asset purchase shock
in the second column of Table 1.
Restrictions with respect to variables that relate to the ECB balance sheet or monetary
policy are generally applied at the 3-month horizon, while output and prices are allowed
to react in the month after the shock.
3.3 Estimation
The model is estimated with Bayesian methods using a flat prior distribution. In par-
ticular, we employ the specification in Uhlig (2005) and set the respective prior matrices
to zero, which yields the posterior distribution with respect to the reduced form model
(1). Regarding the structural model (3), we employ the algorithm in Arias et al. (2014)
to draw the contemporaneous impact matrix A0
. As suggested by the authors, we ob-
tain the reduced form estimates B = [c1
, c2
, B1
, . . . , Bp
] and  first, then a candidate
random matrix A0
is proposed. If the sign restrictions are satisfied, we keep the matrices
{B, , A0
}. Otherwise, we discard the triple. This procedure is repeated until we have
generated a sample of 15,000 draws from the posterior distribution, where the first 5,000
draws are discarded in order to minimize the impact of the starting point.
4 Results
The analysis is performed in two steps. First, we consider impulse response functions
with respect to aggregate euro area data. Estimates for the euro area aggregate are useful
because they allow us to compare our estimated effects of asset purchase shocks to the
existing literature, which ­ as mentioned earlier ­ has focused on balance sheet shocks
more broadly. Beyond that, we discuss the validity of the identified asset purchase shock
and identify a financial stress shock. Then, we estimate the model on German data in
order to assume a country-specific perspective. In particular, we focus on variables that
contain information on firm and financial market responses.
4.1 Euro area
Let us start with our baseline specification, where the euro area composite stress index
captures effects on financial markets. The CISS has been proposed by Holl´
o et al. (2012);
it consists of five sub-indices and lies on the unit interval. Since we employ a novel
identification scheme, the baseline specification also helps us to compare our results to
the existing literature on central bank balance sheet expansions.

4.1.1 Asset purchase shock
We assume that an asset purchase shock hits the economy in period 0. As shown in the
respective column of Table 1, the ECB balance sheet item SHFMPP (securities held for
monetary policy purposes) is restricted to increase, monetary policy is not allowed to use
its conventional interest rate instrument, while at the same time the sum of the balance
sheet positions related to the ECB's MROs and LTROs are required not to increase.
Inflation and output are allowed to react with a one-period lag to policy decisions. The
key innovation of our identification scheme is that we explicitly leave the reaction of
the stress index unrestricted, because we want to let the data speak on the response of
financial stress.
The results of this first exercise are depicted in Figure 2. Throughout the paper, solid
lines depict the median and the blue-shaded area includes the 16-84% quantiles of the
posterior distribution.
The median initial effect on financial stress is positive, while surrounded by uncertainty
bands that include zero. In the following periods, financial stress declines and falls below
its pre-shock level. At the same time, the shock has a temporary expansionary effect
on the real economy; we observe a statistically significant15 increase in output over the
medium term.16 Prices do not change significantly. The tendency for the policy rate to
rise in the medium term might reflect the central bank's reaction to the increase in output.
This contractionary monetary policy response may explain why, a few months after the
shock, stress starts to increase and eventually overshoots its pre-shock level. To some
degree, then, conventional monetary policy offsets the initial stress-reducing effect of the
asset purchase policy impulse. Following a peak after around one year, financial stress

to mean that the respective quantiles of the posterior distribution do not include zero.

falls back to its initial level, while MRO and LTRO volumes expand as banks exploit
the fixed rate full allotment scheme. Note that we observe a stress-reducing impact of
increasing MROs and LTROs in response to a financial shock (see below).
Comparing our impulse response functions to those in Boeckx et al. (2017), reveals
quantitative and qualitative differences. The size of the output reaction is smaller in our
case and the response of prices is insignificant. Most notably, as opposed to the identifying
assumptions imposed by Boeckx et al. (2017), who propose that financial stress does not
increase initially, for our sample, stress falls with a lag of some months. In fact, after about
10 months, we observe positive reactions of stress which draws a somewhat ambiguous
picture of the overall impact on stress. One could worry that our approach may mix up
heterogeneous and potentially opposing effects of the asset purchase programs undertaken
by the ECB. However, as Szczerbowicz (2015) has shown, the interconnectedness between
banks and governments rather leads to an amplification of policy measures.
4.1.2 Financial shock
As our discussion about the identifying assumptions of the asset purchase shock has shown,
it is important to disentangle such a shock from a financial stress shock which comprises
endogenous reactions of private banks or the central bank in response to stress periods.
In order to show the differences in the transmission, we identify a financial shock, which
induces banks to obtain liquidity from MRO or LTRO operations and the central bank to
react through asset purchases. This shock captures the endogenous responses we excluded
for the structural and exogenous asset purchase shock. The identifying assumptions are
summarized more formally in the respective column of Table 1. We keep the duration of
the restrictions comparable to the asset purchase shock.
The dynamic responses to this shock are shown in Figure 3. Liquidity demand rises
for several months and financial stress shows some persistence as well. The combination

of asset purchases and liquidity provision through MROs and LTROs is quite effective in
containing adverse effects on macroeconomic variables: output and prices do not change
significantly over the response horizon. Financial stress peaks on impact and falls rapidly
as the central bank provides liquidity. The median stress response eventually falls below
its pre-shock level.
4.2 Germany
The responsibility for financial stability is not exclusively assigned to euro area institu-
tions, but lies to a large degree at the national level. Since one might argue that the euro
area is not a group of homogeneous countries, it is insightful to investigate the effects of
the asset purchase programs for specific cases. Access to internal firm- and bank-related
data allows us to evaluate the financial effects of unconventional policy measures for the
German case.
We conduct similar experiments as for the euro area case. First, we estimate impulse
response functions for the baseline specification. Then we replace the financial stress
index with other variables of interest. We consider the same time horizon, lag length, and
identification scheme as for the euro area.17
Results for the baseline model are depicted in Figure 4. Compared to the euro area ex-
ercise, qualitatively responses of macroeconomic variables show a similar pattern. Output
rises over the medium term, while prices do not change significantly. The composite stress
index for Germany displays a short-run drop. However, we also find that the purchase
programs significantly raise market financial stress over the medium run. This points to
possible undesirable second-round effects of the purchase programs.
17The only exception is the series on implicit firm defaults for which we have observations until March
2015 only.

Figure 5: Germany. Monthly impulse responses of financial market variables to an asset
purchase shock, all multiplied by 100.
One reason for these unfavorable effects might be that banks grant riskier loans in
response to the shock, which has adverse effects on credit risk. Implicit default rates
of German non-financial firms rise on impact, consistent with this conjecture. Eser and
Schwaab (2016) find a strong but temporary reduction of liquidity risk premia due to the
SMP in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, and Spain, while bid-ask spreads widened again
afterwards. Lambert and Ueda (2014) find for US data that credit risk increases over the
medium term in response to unconventional policy news.
In order to get a more detailed picture on how the asset purchase programs affect
the corporate and financial sectors, we consider alternative specifications to our baseline
choice of variables (2). In particular, we successively replace the financial stress index xt
with a series from a set of variables that contain information on the policy transmission
channel or capture potential unintended side effects. Figure 5 contains the responses of
those variables to an asset purchase shock.18
The ECB argues that its unconventional measures help to restore the monetary trans-
mission channel. They involve supporting banks' credit provision to non-financial firms in
order to finance new investment projects. Figure 5 however indicates that, in Germany,
asset purchases did not generate more lending to non-financial firms.
We proxy credit risk by loan write-offs as a fraction of German banks' lending stock
to corporates. Ceteris paribus, i.e. for a given default risk in the corporate sector, a
reduction in write-offs indicates that banks are less cautious with respect to potential
losses. Consequently, ex-ante credit risk rises. Our use of data on write-offs differs from
Angbazo (1997) or Dick (2006) who view them as a direct measure of credit default, such
that increased write-offs reflect higher ex-post credit risk. One concern related to liquidity
injections is that banks might roll over existing loans or extend new loans to nonviable
18We omit plots of the other 5 variables included in the VAR.
12
firms, which would be reflected in increased net loan write-offs.19 The median response
shows that, at least in the short run, liquidity provisioning induces banks to reduce their
loan write-offs. While this result is associated with much estimation uncertainty, it may
suggest that banks do not fully take into account credit risk. In connection with the
increase in implicit firm defaults, this result may point to higher financial stability risks.
The VDAX-NEW index reflects risk aversion in the stock market.20 Results show that
market participants become less optimistic about future stock market developments over
the medium run. The initial response to the shock is insignificant.
The positive response of the equity ratio suggests that the banks to some extent use
the liquidity provided by the central bank in order to recapitalize their balance sheets by
obtaining more equity financing.
The portfolio balancing channel has often been mentioned in connection with central
bank asset purchase programs.21 Among other things, it predicts a decline in interest rates.
If the central bank undertakes large-scale asset purchases, the prices of those assets should
rise and yields should decline accordingly. Since interest rates on assets fell and investors
are equipped with liquidity from the central bank, they have an incentive to rebalance
their portfolios and to buy comparable but more profitable assets. The increased demand
will in turn induce asset prices to increase and interest rates to fall further. We introduce
bank lending rates in the VAR in order to test the pass-through to lending rates to non-
financial corporations. From the impulse response functions we find that lending rates
show a tendency to fall initially. However, the width of the error bands shows that this
result is quite imprecise. Lending rates actually rise over the medium term in response to
the ECB's asset purchase programs. Thus, we do not observe a portfolio balance effect
on bank lending rates. Looking at this result more closely, we note that lending rates are
tightly connected to the policy rate and follow its pattern. As the policy rate rises some
months after the shock, lending rates mimic this response.22
To conclude, while macroeconomic effects of asset purchase programs in Germany are
favorable, with output increasing significantly and no effect on prices, financial market
variables paint a less optimistic picture. Lending to firms does not expand or become
cheaper, implicit firm default rates rise and financial stress also increases eventually.
Our results imply some uncertainty with respect to initial reactions to the shock while
medium-term effects are exposed more clearly. Different from event studies which focus
on short-term impact of measures, our model emphasizes the medium-term implications.
19Lambert and Ueda (2014) find US banks to avoid repairing their balance sheet and call this "ever-
greening".
20Similar to the VDAX, the VDAX-NEW is a volatility index. The construction of the VDAX-NEW
is more closely related to the VSTOXX. Instead of of relying on fictitious option price data it is compiled
with traded options.
21See e.g. Draghi (2014).
22We carried out a robustness exercise, where we require the policy rate to stay unchanged only on
impact instead of three months. In that case, the policy rate is lowered in response to the shock, which
allows bank lending rates to decline. The respective impulse response functions are available upon request.

5 Conclusion
This paper estimates the effects of ECB's asset purchase programs, focusing on financial
market variables. We disentangle asset purchase shocks from changes in the balance sheet
that reflect endogenous liquidity provisioning through the fixed rate full allotment policy.
We find that ECB balance sheet policies, in the form of direct asset purchases, bring
down financial stress for some periods after the shock. This positive effect is reversed
thereafter as stress increases above its pre-shock level. At the same time, asset purchase
shocks have an expansionary effect on economic activity, while the effect on prices remains
insignificant. Our approach differs from the existing literature in that we do not impose
restrictions on financial stress in order to identify discretionary asset purchase shocks. We
also find that liquidity provisioning through a fixed rate full allotment policy in response
to a financial shock appears to be successful in containing adverse effects on output and
prices.
Macroeconomic implications of the asset purchase programs for the German economy
are generally similar. Initially, financial stress declines. However, after several months
financial stress rises, which suggests that a more detailed analysis of financial market re-
sponses is warranted. Stock market volatility and risk aversion increase in response to the
policy measure. We find that asset purchases are not successful in restoring credit creation
in Germany. Bank lending rates, do not decrease as suggested by the portfolio balancing
channel. Loan write-offs decline while implicit firm default rates rise significantly, indi-
cating that bank lending might be becoming more risky. To sum up, our analysis shows
that, while output effects in the euro area and Germany are positive, there are indications
of increasing risks to financial stability. While event studies usually document short-term
implications of policy measures, our analysis gives insights into the dynamic responses of
the macroeconomy and financial variables.
The question remains to which extent asset purchase programs influence individual
financial institutions and how effects feed back to the macroeconomy. It would be partic-
ularly interesting to consider data at an institutional level in order to overcome the small
sample size problem. Examining more disaggregated data using appropriate empirical
models is left for future research.

Appendix
A Data
Table A.1 gives a detailed overview of the data series used in our analysis. Some of the
series were transformed before estimation. Data on real GDP is not available on a monthly
frequency. For this reason we imputed the missing values using the Chow and Lin (1971)
method as it is done in Boeckx et al. (2017) and Gambacorta et al. (2014). In general, we
used seasonally and working day adjusted data where available. In the case of German
loan write-offs and the equity ratio we used unadjusted data. The data on loan write-
offs and the equity ratio are taken from the monthly balance sheet statistics ("monatliche
Bilanzstatistik") which consists of confidential data on German MFIs balance sheets. The
former are net write-offs, depreciation less revaluation of credit to the corporate sector as

A particularly important component of our exercise is the Composite Indicator of Sys-
temic Stress. The CISS is meant to condense the state of financial instability into a single
statistic. It aggregates five market-specific subindices created from a total of 15 individual
financial stress measures. The weights used in the aggregation reflect time-varying cross-
correlations between subindices. This puts relatively more weight on situations in which
stress prevails in several market segments at the same time. The CISS provides an ex-post
measure of systemic risk, i.e. risk which has materialized already. The construction of
the CISS considers comprises data from money markets, equity markets, bond markets,
foreign exchange markets, and financial intermediaries. It uses standard securities market
indicators, e.g. volatilities, risk spreads, cumulative valuation losses.

purchase programs are generally quite persistent. In particular, we imposed prolonged
zero restrictions on the policy rate rt
for two reasons. First, we do not want to mix up
conventional policy shocks with balance sheet policy which leads us to keep this restric-
tion at least as long as the sign restriction on the balance sheet prevails. Second, our
results should contain some information about constrained conventional monetary policy
environments, i.e. the zero lower bound restriction. In Figure B.1 we provide results of
an alternative identification scheme, where the restriction on the policy rate is imposed
only on impact.
B.2 Alternative lag length
We performed an additional robustness exercise with respect to the lag length of the
model. In Figure B.2 we provide results for the asset purchase shock in a model with only
two lags. Impulse responses have a similar pattern compared to the baseline case. Stress
falls after some months but then rises again and rises above its pre-shock level. The
response of output is positive over the medium term. Quantitatively, we find a longer
lasting positive response of output and a very short-lived negative response of prices.
However, we would still argue that we can hardly verify a noticeable effect on prices since
error bands include zero from period 4 onwards.
B.3 Policy rate shock
We also computed impulse responses to a "conventional" policy rate shock. The policy
rate is assumed to decrease on impact and in the following two months, while output,
prices and the balance sheet items do not react on impact. Results are depicted in Figure
B.3. We find that the policy instrument is ineffective with respect to output and we
observe a positive response of prices which lasts for a few months. The effectiveness of

conventional policy instruments appears to be limited within our sample.23
23Results are consistent with the findings of Abbassi and Linzert (2012), who observe a loss in conven-
tional policy effectiveness. In fact, the impact of conventional policies on financial stress is insignificant
in our sample. If at all, it seems to reduce stress after about 4 to 5 months.
