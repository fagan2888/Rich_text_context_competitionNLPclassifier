Abstract
The inability of most bank merger studies to control for hidden bailouts may
lead to biased results. In this study, we employ a unique data set of approx-
imately 1,000 mergers to analyze the determinants of bank mergers. We use
data on the regulatory intervention history to distinguish between distressed
and non-distressed mergers. We find that, among merging banks, distressed
banks had the worst profiles and acquirers perform somewhat better than tar-
gets. However, both distressed and non-distressed mergers have worse CAMEL
profiles than our control group. In fact, non-distressed mergers may be mo-
tivated by the desire to forestall serious future financial distress and prevent
regulatory intervention.

Non-technical summary
The wave of consolidation in the German banking sector has led to a constant
reduction in the number of credit institutions over a considerable number
of years. In fact, a significant number of these mergers involves either dis-
tressed targets or, less frequently, distressed acquirers. It appears that mergers
at times also serve the objective to prevent banks from failure. Particularly
among savings and cooperative banks, problem institutions are normally not
dissolved but, instead, are merged with a neighboring institution in the same
banking group. An analysis of the factors determining mergers in the banking
sector must take account of this fact to avoid reaching the wrong conclusions.
The present study is the first merger analysis in Germany that is based on
Bundesbank data on mergers and distressed banks in the industry. These data
make it possible to distinguish between distressed and non-distressed merg-
ers. The banks can be divided into six categories. Both acquiring institutions
and acquired institutions are subdivided into banks with problems and banks
without problems. A further category comprises institutions which have been
intensively scrutinized by the supervisory authority but which have remained
in existence without being the subject of a merger. In addition, institutions
which, in the observation period, were neither classified as problem cases nor
became the subject of a merger have been included as a control group.
Using this classification, we model the wave of consolidation as a stochas-
tic process involving the six possible situations in which an institution may
find itself. The various probabilities are estimated using a multi-nominal logit
model based on the institution-specific data. This form of modelling enables us
to subject the different financial profiles of the institutions to an econometric
analysis.
Our results show that most mergers involve institutions with a comparatively
poor financial profile. This is precisely what one would expect in the case of
institutions which have been reported as problem cases to the supervisory
authority. What is surprising, however, is that the institutions taken over in
non-distressed mergers are often also in a comparatively precarious state. In
many cases the principal aim of such mergers therefore seems to be to prevent
problem cases arising at all or to correct such cases in the face of failure.
In both problem and no problem mergers we find that it is largely size and
capitalization that determines if a bank is more likely to become an acquirer.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Die Konsolidierungswelle im deutschen Bankensektor hat dazu geführt, dass
die Zahl der Kreditinstitute seit Jahren beständig zurückgeht. Eine signifikante
Anzahl dieser Fusionen betrifft dabei entweder problembehaftete übernommene
und, seltener, übernehmende Banken. Es scheint, dass eine Reihe von Fusionen
somit der Vermeidung von Insolvenzen dient. Insbesondere im Sparkassen- und
Genossenschaftssektor werden problembehaftete Institute in der Regel nicht
aufgelöst, sondern gehen mit einem benachbarten Institut aus der gleichen
Institutsgruppe zusammen. Eine Analyse der Bestimmungsgründe für Fusio-
nen im Bankensektor muss dieser Tatsache Rechnung tragen, um nicht zu
falschen Schlussfolgerungen zu gelangen.
Die vorliegende Arbeit ist die erste Analyse von Fusionen im deutschen Banken-
sektor auf der Grundlage von Bundesbankdaten zu Fusionen und Problem-
fällen. Diese Daten erlauben es, zwischen problembehafteten und nicht-problem-
behafteten Fusionen zu unterscheiden. Insbesondere lassen sich die Banken in
sechs Kategorien einteilen. Die ersten vier Kategorien bilden übernehmende
und übernommene Institute, jeweils untergliedert in problembehaftete und
nicht-problembehaftete Banken. Eine weitere Gruppe bilden Institute, die von
der Aufsicht einer intensiven Beobachtung unterzogen wurden, die aber weiter-
bestehen, ohne dass es in der Folgezeit zu einer Fusion gekommen ist. Als
Vergleichsgruppe werden ferner diejenigen Institute herangezogen, die in dem
Beobachtungszeitraum weder als Problemfall klassifiziert wurden noch fusio-
niert haben.
Aufbauend auf dieser Kategorisierung modellieren wir die Konsolidierungswelle
als stochastischen Prozess über die sechs möglichen Zustände eines Insti-
tuts. Die jeweiligen Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeiten werden dabei mit Hilfe eines
multinominalen Logitmodells aus den institutspezifischen Daten geschätzt.
Diese Art der Modellierung erlaubt es uns, die unterschiedlichen Finanzprofile
der Institute einer ökonometrischen Analyse zugänglich zu machen.
Unsere Resultate zeigen, dass Fusionen vor allem unter Einbezug von Insti-
tuten mit vergleichsweise schlechtem Finanzprofil stattfinden. Für Institute,
die der Aufsicht als problembehaftet gemeldet wurden, deckt sich dieses Ergeb-
nis mit den Erwartungen. Überraschend ist dagegen, dass auch bei nicht-
problembehafteten Fusionen die übernommenen Institute vielfach vergleichs-
weise schwächere Finanzprofile aufweisen. Das Ziel solcher Fusionen scheint
demnach unter anderem in der Prävention oder der Bereinigung von Pro-
blemfällen im Vorfeld eines drohenden Ausfalls zu liegen. Wir zeigen außer-
dem, dass vor allem Größe und Kapitalisierung der Bank darüber entscheiden,
ob sie in der Fusion die Rolle des übernehmenden Instituts einnimmt.

Accounting for Distress in Bank Mergers1
1 Introduction
In banking, outright failures are extremely rare. 2 Instead, distressed banks
are frequently expected to be merged out. Regulatory discretion and potential
financial instability due to loss of public confidence ensure that information
about distressed mergers is rarely available. As a result, most bank merger
studies are unable to control for the existence of hidden bailouts. This shortfall
may lead to serious selection bias. For example, it may explain why previous
studies find that merging banks underperform compared to the rest of the
market.
In this study we use a unique confidential data set provided by the German
Bundesbank. The data consist of detailed information on approximately 1,000
mergers of cooperative banks and savings banks in the period 1995-2001. 3
During this period, bailouts accounted for about 10 percent of bank mergers.
We use undisclosed information on the regulatory intervention history to dis-
tinguish between distressed and non-distressed mergers. Rather than defining
distress ourselves, we make use of the Bundesbank data to distinguish dis-
tressed mergers from voluntary mergers, thereby reducing an important de-
pendency problem that exists in the literature (Wheelock and Wilson, 2000).
As a result, we can gain a much better understanding of bank merger mo-
tives. 4

3 Between 1989 and 2001 the number of German banks declined from 4,193 to 2,423
due to an unprecedented merger wave among cooperative and savings banks. While
no commercial banks failed during this period, a substantial number of German
bank mergers were attributable to bailouts of distressed institutions by regulatory
authorities (Elsass, 2004).
4 According to Berger (2003) and Goddard et al. (2001), a variety of potential
merger motives exist, including the improvement of efficiency, diversification of earn-
ings and risk, growth through acquisition, realization of economies of scale or scope,
or increase in market power.
1
If banks cherry pick top performing targets, we expect to find that economies of
scale, market power, or managerial incentives motivate mergers. On the other
hand, the efficient management hypothesis (e.g., see Roll, 1986) proposes that
acquiring banks replace poorly performing target bank management by more
skilled executives. Berger (1997) and Berger, Demsetz, and Strahan (1999)
find that managerial efficiency tends to improve after bank mergers. However,
few studies examine efficiency as an ex ante determinant of mergers. In this
study we use measures of X-efficiency derived from stochastic frontier analyses
to investigate the role of cost and profit efficiency as a merger motive. Also,
we employ a variety of covariates to capture the financial profiles of merging
banks.
We find that among merging banks, distressed banks had the worst profiles and
acquirers performed somewhat better than targets. However, both distressed
and non-distressed mergers had worse CAMEL profiles than our control group.
Thus, cherry picking high performing targets is not supported by our empirical
evidence. In fact, non-distressed mergers may be motivated by the desire to
forestall serious future financial distress and prevent regulatory intervention.
An important implication of our results is that the inability to account for
hidden bailouts is indeed a salient error in the bank merger literature.
Our paper continues as follows. First, in section 2 we review the relevant liter-
ature on bank mergers with a particular focus on potential path dependency
problems of failures and acquisitions. In section 3, we describe our methodol-
ogy and data. We define five different merger events and a set of explanatory
covariates that characterize the financial profile of banks. Next, in section 4 we
present our empirical results. We start by quantifying the effects of changes
in banks' financial profiles on the respective probabilities that they will be
involved in a particular type of merger. We then report evidence on the im-
portance of accounting for various groups of banks that participated in the
merger wave. We conclude in section 5.
2 Literature
Closely related to the present study, Wheelock and Wilson (2000) compare
characteristics of U.S. banks (greater than $50 million in assets) that exited
via failure versus those that exited through acquisition in the years 1984-1993.
They apply a competing-risks framework to these alternative forms of exit and
estimate separate, independent models for failure and acquisition using a Cox
(1972) proportional-hazard approach. They point out that it is possible that
these exit paths are dependent on one another, as impending failure could
motivate an acquisition. To partially account for this potential dependency,
they include the ratio of equity to total assets in their acquisition model. In-
2
deed, they find that this variable is significant and that failure risk helps to
explain some acquisitions. They employ two classes of independent variables:
(1) different components of CAMEL ratings (i.e., capital, asset quality, man-
agement quality, and liquidity), and (2) bank traits including size, holding
company and branching status, and age. They measure management quality
with efficiency scores derived from cross-sectional translog cost functions and
nonparametric Shepard (1970) input and output distance functions. In their
study, distress can lead to outright failure or exit via a merger. Failed banks
are defined as either banks closed by the FDIC or banks with tier 1 capital
ratios less than two percent (i.e., critically undercapitalized under bank reg-
ulatory laws). 5 Their results indicate that banks most likely to fail tend to
have lower operating efficiency and weaker financial condition. By contrast,
acquired banks tend to have higher managerial efficiency and can be char-
acterized by stronger financial profiles than other banks. Also, smaller banks
and banks in branch banking states are more likely to be acquired than other
banks. The authors conclude that managerially inefficient and financially weak
banks are more (less) likely to exit via failure (acquisition). Hence, these two
types of exit are quite different from one another. 6
Importantly, other empirical studies by Hannan and Rhoades (1987), O'Keefe
(1996), Thompson (1997), Hadlock, Houston, and Ryngaert (1999), Worthing-
ton (2004), and Vander Vennet (2003) report results that are contrary to those
of Wheelock and Wilson. In general, they find that target banks have a worse
financial profile than acquirers. One possible explanation for these different
results is that Wheelock and Wilson carefully control for both failed and fi-
nancially distressed banks in their sampling procedures. Alternatively, differ-
ent results may be explained by sample differences in terms of country, period,
and types of banks under investigation.
Hannan and Rhoades (1987) hypothesize that poorly managed banks are more
likely to exit than other banks due to the market for corporate control. For
the period 1971-1982, they estimate a multinomial logit model for 1,046 Texas
banks and 201 mergers. They include measures of bank performance and bank
market characteristics and distinguish between three categories: (1) no acqui-
sition, (2) acquisition within one geographic market, and (3) acquisition be-
tween two markets. While none of the profit, loan activity, or size variables
5 This capital ratio is computed as total equity capital less goodwill divided by
total assets.
6 A more recent paper by Wheelock and Wilson (2003) investigates the reasons why
some banks engage in mergers and other banks do not, including the intensity of
merger activity. Focusing on the effects of regulatory supervision on merger activity,
they find that banks with higher quality regulatory CAMEL and CRA ratings, lower
market concentration, location in an urban market, larger asset size, and higher asset
risk tend to increase merger activity among banks. See also Calomiris and Karceski
(1998) for research on case studies of merger motivations.

is significant, measures of bank market share, bank growth, market growth,
and location in local versus urban areas are. Also, banks with lower capital
ratios are more likely to be acquired. Based on their findings, they conclude
that there is no support for the notion that the market for corporate control
eliminates poorly managed banks.
Extending Hannan and Rhoades, O'Keefe (1996) applies a stepwise logit re-
gression model to identify both targets and acquirers among the population
of U.S. commercial and savings banks for the period 1984-1996. Excluding
mergers among affiliated bank holding company institutions but including
regulatory-assisted mergers, he finds that target banks have significantly lower
profits than acquirers, as well as higher expenses on fixed assets and more core
deposits. Using proxies for CAMEL rating components, targets tend to have
relatively low management quality, low earnings, and low liquidity. Also, tar-
gets are smaller in asset size than acquirers.
Thompson (1997) examines the determinants of acquisitions of U.K. build-
ing societies in the period 1981-1993. Although building societies are mutu-
ally owned, results are similar to those for joint stock companies. The logit
model results showed that targets (including those involved in regulatory-
assisted mergers) are more likely than other banks to have a smaller asset
size, slower asset growth, retained earnings below regulatory requirements,
and negative profits. Thompson concludes that building societies with low
earnings are likely to be encouraged by regulators to consider acquisition by
stronger institutions.
In a related study, Worthington (2004) evaluates the determinants of mergers
among mutual credit unions in Australia. He estimates technical and scale effi-
ciency indices using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and employs a multino-
mial logit model to examine the factors that help explain if a credit union is
acquired, acquiring, or not engaged in any merger activity. In addition to cost
efficiency, he also uses proxies for CAMEL components. Results show that
50 percent of targets and 60 percent of acquirers are correctly identified by
the model. Overall classification accuracy is about 96 percent. Worthington
finds that target banks tend to be relatively small in size and have low liq-
uidity. However, cost efficiency measures of managerial ability -- that is, scale
efficiency (measured by overall technical efficiency divided by pure technical
efficiency) and optimal sizes (measured by increasing or decreasing returns-
to-scale) -- are not significant. Acquirers tend to be larger, more profitable,
and scale efficient banks. Thus, managerially efficient credit unions tend to
purchase targets that are less efficient.
Hadlock, Houston, and Ryngaert (1999) focus on studying the role of man-
agerial incentives in 287 U.S. bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the
period 1982-1992. They find that banks with relatively low levels of manage-
4
ment ownership are more likely to be acquired. After acquisition, management
turnover rates increase. However, profitability (as measured by return on as-
sets) is not a significant determinant in mergers. They conclude that man-
agement entrenchment (or resistance) is a determining factor in bank M&A
activity.
Relatively few studies of European bank M&As have been published. Van-
der Vennet (1996) reports evidence on 492 bank M&As among 10 European
countries in the period 1988-1993. He is careful to distinguish between four
different types of consolidations: (1) cross-border takeovers; (2) domestic ac-
quisitions in which more than 50 percent of the voting control is obtained by
the acquirer but the two institutions remain independent legal entities; (3)
domestic mergers among equal-sized banks; (4) domestic mergers of large and
small banks in which the latter are absorbed by the former to form a single,
larger bank. Takeovers of failed banks are excluded from the analyses. Based
on univariate statistical tests, he finds that targets are less profitable and cost
efficient (as measured by the deviation of bank total costs from a translog
cost frontier) than acquirers in cross-border takeovers. In the case of domes-
tic acquisitions, acquirers are larger, more profitable, and input-efficient, but
targets are not significantly different from a control group of banks. For do-
mestic mergers of equals, both target and acquirer banks suffer declines in
profits and operational efficiency prior to the merger event (with a reversal in
these trends afterwards). Finally, for domestic mergers of unequal-sized banks,
pre-merger performance is similar among targets and acquirers. Interestingly,
when targets have inferior performance prior to M&As, acquirers are unable
to improve their performance after consolidation. Thus, the evidence appears
to be mixed. Whether underperforming banks are more likely to be targets
depends on the type of consolidation.
Closely related to our work, Lang and Welzel (1999) examine the cost effi-
ciency implications of mergers among German cooperative banks in Bavaria
(i.e., about 25 percent of the total cooperative bank population). They sample
283 mergers between 1989 and 1997 and estimate a translog cost frontier to
measure cost X-efficiency. When they calculate ex ante and ex post merger effi-
ciency differences among acquired and acquirer banks, they find that acquiring
banks are less efficient than acquired banks in 47 percent of the mergers. In
only 70 out of 283 mergers, the acquired bank is less efficient than the acquir-
ing banks. In these cases ex post efficiency of the acquired banks generally
does not improve. They infer that the cost efficiency motive for mergers is not
strongly supported by the empirical evidence -- that is, acquired banks are not
selected by acquiring banks with the intention of improving their operating
efficiency and thereby increasing profitability of the combined entity. Instead,
regulatory and other considerations have historically been important factors
motivating cooperative bank mergers, including prohibition of mergers with
other banks outside the region, restriction to only cooperative bank deals,
5
and even the retirement of senior managers. These non-economic motivations
have tended to diminish the role of financial performance in merger decisions
among German cooperative banks.
Focarelli, Panetta, and Salleo (2002) investigate bank M&As in Italy for the
period 1985-1996. They run a multinomial logit to identify which financial
characteristics distinguish bidders and targets from banks that do not engage
in M&As. They find that targets are less profitable and have higher labor costs,
both of which suggest low performance compared to other banks. Acquired
banks are characterized by relatively low profitability, low costs of funds, and
many bad loans. An interesting finding is that mergers are associated with ex-
pansion of financial services, whereas acquisitions are related to improving the
quality of the loan portfolio. Ex post analyses of bank performance confirms
that mergers and acquisitions are quite different forms of exit with separate
motives and outcomes.
Vander Vennet (2003) examines the determinants and effects of 62 cross-border
deals in Europe during the period 1990-2001. Using a control group of 800
other banks, he uses a multinomial logit model to discriminate between ac-
quiring, acquired, and control banks but does not distinguish between failing
or distressed banks from other banks in the former two groups. Although the
fit of the model is relatively low, with a pseudo R2 of only 20 percent, re-
sults clearly indicate that acquiring buyers have lower (higher) cost (profit)
ratios than acquired banks. Thus, acquired banks tend to be underperformers
relative to acquiring banks. In further analyses he compares cost and profit
efficiency scores of these two bank groups prior to M&A deals. Following Lang
and Welzel (1996), he uses a translog functional form to estimate X-efficiency.
Ranked efficiency scores of acquired banks are significantly lower than those of
acquiring banks, especially with respect to profit efficiency. Tests of pre- versus
post-M&A cost and profit efficiency reveal that profit efficiency of acquired
banks rises to the control (peer) group level after the acquisition.
A number of studies have compared the efficiency of banks involved in M&A
deals with simple measures of efficiency and performance. For 135 U.S. bank
takeovers, Cheng, Gup, and Wall (1989) report that profit ratios of target
banks are higher than those of acquirer banks, although mean differences
are insignificant. Berger and Humphrey (1992) study mega mergers involving
banks exceeding $1 billion in assets and find that bidder banks are on average
more X-efficient (relative to a translog stochastic frontier) than target banks.
In a study of U.S. commercial bank mergers, Rhoades (1993) finds that bidder
banks have significantly lower noninterest expense to assets ratios than target
banks. Fixler and Zieschang (1993) note that 160 acquiring banks have higher
productivity (measured by an aggregate output index of efficiency) than a
control sample of less than 2,000 banks. Vander Vennet (1996) observes that
target banks have lower financial performance than acquirers that do not
6
improve after M&As. And, Avkiran (1999) finds that mean efficiency scores
(estimated using data envelopment analysis, or DEA, techniques) of acquired
Australian trading banks are lower than those of acquiring banks. 7
In sum, with the notable exception of Wheelock and Wilson, previous studies
of depository institution acquisitions generally find that targets are either low
performing or no different from other banks. Potentially, the result of Whee-
lock and Wilson differ due to the fact that they control for regulatory-assisted
mergers in their sampling procedures. In the present study we explicitly con-
trol for German cooperative and savings bank mergers where at least one
bank is deemed distressed by regulatory authorities. These banks are subject
to regulatory intervention by the Bundesbank. Unlike previous studies, we are
interested in comparing the determinants of two types of target bank exit: reg-
ulatory arranged (distressed) mergers and voluntary (non-distressed) mergers.
Extending work by Wheelock and Wilson (2000), we do not exclude failed or
distressed banks from our analysis. To our knowledge no other studies have
examined bank exit due to regulatory intervention. The confidential regula-
tory information provided by the Bundesbank enables us to obtain a sample
of merger targets in which failure is not imminent. Rather than calibrating the
definition of distress within the framework of our analysis, we are thereby able
to make use of the ex ante definitions used by the Bundesbank. In addition,
we can benefit from the confidential information gathered by bank examiners.
Consequently, we significantly reduce dependency problems when we predict
the likelihood of different types of (non-)merger events.
3 Methodology and data
To test whether regulatory assisted (distressed) mergers are fundamentally
different from unassisted mergers, we measure the influences of financial pro-
files on the probability of being involved in a particular type of merger. The
empirical model allows prediction of multiple events.
3.1 Empirical specification
We assume that banks can experience five distinctly separate events during the
merger wave. We further assume that the chances of being involved in an event
in a given year can be explained by two classes of explanatory covariates. The
first class coincides with a bank's financial profile. The second class considers
macroeconomic conditions and other bank characteristics. We predict events
7 See also studies by Rose (1987, 1988) and Hunter and Wall (1989).
7
Y = i with a common covariate vector x. We have annual observations for
our covariates. And we consider it important to allow for the possibility that
the different merger events are not entirely independent. This consideration is
further validated by Wheelock and Wilson (2000), who also find that failure
risk helps explain acquisitions, when they include the ratio of equity to total
assets in their acquisition model as a rough proxy. Finally, we consider it
useful to allow for the possible existence of serial acquirers. Therefore, we use
a multinomial logit model.
As a result, our modelling approach differs from Wheelock and Wilson (2000),
who use a Cox proportional hazard model. We consider several additional
problems with applying this model in our analysis. First, the time dimension in
our panel is limited. For the current sample, the maximum number of periods
(years) until a merger is seven. We can extend this somewhat, but at the
considerable cost of losing many observations for our covariates. Alternatively,
we considered measuring merger events on a monthly basis. However, this
would create additional problems. We would still have annual observations for
most of our covariates. And we may seriously increase measurement problems
regarding merger events. 8
For a number of i = 0, .., J groups, our model is given by Greene (2003) as: 9
p(Y = j) =
ej
x
1 +
5
k=1
ej
x
, p(Y = 0) =
1
1 +
5
k=1
ej
x
for j = 1, ..., 5. (1)
We normalize by measuring the relative influence of an identical set of covari-
ates x for five different events with respect to a common reference group of no
events, where an event is either an assisted (distressed) or unassisted merger.
Estimated parameters per group, 
j
, yield the effect of covariates x on the
logged ratio of probabilities relative to this reference group, i.e., ln (pj
/p0
)=

j
x.
8 As an example, consider the fact that distressed and non-distressed mergers may
exhibit - different - seasonal patterns.
9 Other bank merger studies that employ the multinomial logit are Focarelli et
al. (2002), Worthington (2004), and Hannan and Rhoades (1987). An important
assumption is that relative probabilities in the multinomial logit model are inde-
pendent from each other, the so-called independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA)
assumption. To test for IIA, Greene (2003) suggests to specify a nested logit model
where alternative events are grouped on different levels. According to Hausmann
and McFadden (1984), it is then possible to test the IIA directly, because excluding
an irrelevant class of events will not lead to consistent estimates. However, we do
not specificy a nested logit model as it requires that the choices at a given level are
mutually exclusive. This is clearly not the case in our study, and we therefore follow
the bank merger literature and use the multinomial logit model.
8
Estimation requires independence of the observations. In fact, it is unlikely
that in our panel setting the observations fulfill this requirement. We there-
fore relax the independence assumption and utilize a robust estimate of the
variance of  (Huber, 1967; and White, 1980a, 1980b). This procedure leaves
estimated coefficients unchanged but provides robust standard errors of esti-
mated coefficients. 10
We report relative risk ratios (RRR), which measure the change of the prob-
ability of being in group j relative to the probability of being in the reference
group for a one-unit change in the underlying variablex. 11 The RRR for a
one-unit change in covariate x from value a to value a + 1 is as follows: 12
RRRj
(a, b) =
p(y = j|x = a)/p(y = 0|x = a)
p(y = j|x = a + 1)/p(y = 0|x = a + 1)
= ej . (2)
For example, an RRRj
of one is analogous to a zero coefficient. A change
in the variable does not affect the probability of being in group j relative to
the probability of being in the reference group. 13 Likewise, an RRRj
above
one indicates an increase of the probability ratio as x increases, and an RRRj
below one implies a declining relative risk to be in group j as x increases. 14
3.2 Merger events
For the purpose of our study, it is crucial that we carefully distinguish between
distressed and non-distressed merger events. We define a distressed bank as a
bank which is in danger of ceasing to exist as a going concern without outside
intervention. In order to identify situations of distress we adopt a set of criteria
covering any intervention on the part of the supervisory authority, the auditor
10 While occasionally (fixed effect) panel estimators for multinomial logit models
have been applied in the literature (Boersch-Supan and Pollakowski, 1990), we are
not aware of any applications to bank merger analyses. Hosmer and Lemeshow
(2000) suggest a comparison of cross-sectional and panel estimations for binary
logit models. In three out of five binary logit estimations, the estimated variance
component is tested to be insignificant. We therefore report cross-sectional estima-
tions with robust standard errors.
11 References for a more in-depth discussion are provided in Hosmer and Lemeshow
(2000).
12 Reported relative risk ratios are therefore exponentiated coefficients. For exam-

We subdivide our group of distressed banks into those that (i) were distressed
targets (DT), (ii) distressed acquirers (DA), or (iii) continued to exist without
any additional event (intervention only, I). 16 We suspect that those banks
engaging in mergers without any prior intervention are fundamentally differ-
ent and, therefore, must be modeled as separate events. 17 These banks are
designated as voluntary targets (T) and voluntary acquirers (A). We estimate
the likelihood of belonging to one of these groups relative to the same refer-
ence group consisting of all bank observations where none of the above events
occurred. 18 This control group consists of banks that are neither distressed
nor involved in a merger (O).

Amel et al. (2004) point out that merger waves are a dynamic process. In fact,
15 Excessive losses are losses amounting to 25% of liable capital or a negative op-
erating result in excess of 25% of liable capital. Distressed events result from a
disclosure of facts pursuant to section 29(3) of the Banking Act (BA), moratoriums
pursuant to section 46a of the BA and capital preservation measures (including as
a result of restructuring caused by mergers).
16 We also estimated the model excluding interventions without subsequent merger.
Results were not affected for the most part.
17 In line with other failure studies, we also defined distress as capitalization ratios
close to regulatory minimum values. However, only a handful of banks had equity
ratios close to regulatory thresholds.
18 Thus, we also include pre-event observations of banks that ultimately experience
an event in the control group. Excluding these bank observations did not change
our results.
10
in our sample period a number of banks experienced multiple events. Some
banks that acquired another institute subsequently experienced regulatory
intervention and later became the target in an arranged or assisted merger.
In our analysis these banks are grouped as A, then I, and finally as DT.
By allowing one bank to experience multiple events, we acknowledge these
dynamics. 19 Table 1 gives the number of yearly observations for our reference
and respective event groups. Here we see the increasing momentum of the
merger wave between 1998 and 2001. Notice that distressed mergers account
for about 15 percent of total mergers in the sample period.
3.3 Explanatory variables
Our database on distressed versus non-distressed bank merger contains infor-
mation on the date of a takeover, identity of the acquiring and target institu-
tions, and date of intervention. All mergers have in common that the target
ceases to exist and no ex post data on the target are available. 20
We calculate CAMEL covariates per bank and year. The data are collected
mainly from balance sheets and profit and loss accounts that are reported
annually to the supervision department of the Deutsche Bundesbank. With
the exception of two banks, no financial data are available for target banks in
the year of the merger. 21 For the risk-related covariates, we draw from annual
audit reports compiled by the Bundesbank, in addition to reports submitted
by banks pursuant to the Principle I requirements of the 1988 Basle Accord.
Monthly balance sheet reports are a further source to compute intra-annual
asset growth.
We collect regional macroeconomic covariates that control for the geographical
demarcations within the two banking sectors from DeStatis Regional, a data-
base supplied by the Land Office for Data Processing and Statistics of North
Rhine-Westphalia. This database provides annual numbers per Bundesland on
19 Of course, intervention may or may not lead to a merger. In most cases, the time
that elapses between an intervention and a merger is very short. In fact, for approxi-
mately two thirds of our distressed mergers, the intervention and later merger occur
in the same year. The average time between interventions and either DA or DT is
around 1.4 years. Only if a merger occurs more than four years after intervention,
do we no longer classify it as distressed (but as voluntary). However, changing the
time until "rehabilitation" has little or no affect on the results.
20 It should be noted that no transactions involving acquisition of minority stakes or
maintenance of the target bank as a separate institute exist among German savings
and cooperative banks. This is not surprising in view of their public and mutual
ownership, as well as tightly integrated networks.
21 This data restriction further explains using lagged financial profiles.
11
population, GDP, and insolvency ratios. Both savings and cooperative banks
are allowed to operate only in the region to which they are assigned (Greve,
2002; Hackethal, 2004).
As mentioned above, we account for both financial profiles of banks as well
as the economic conditions under which banks operate. Like previous studies,
we use the CAMEL taxonomy as a way to define covariates that constitute
a bank's financial profile. 22 As a result, the financial profile employed in this
study consists of nine key financial ratios that capture (i) Capital adequacy
(coded ci
), (ii) Asset quality (ai
), (iii) Management ability (mi
), (iv) Earnings
level (ei
), and (v) Liquidity management (li
). 23 Furthermore, we employ three
variables to capture macroeconomic and bank characteristics, as well as year
and bank type dummies. All covariates are included with a one year lag. 24
Table 2 reports the mean values of these variables.
We expect improvements in any financial ratio to reduce relative probabilities
on distressed events (i.e., result in an RRR below one). For non-distressed
events such inferences are less clear, as they depend on whether targets are
acquired due to underperformance or cherry picking of profitable banks. As
discussed in the introduction, this issue is unresolved in the literature. Based
on financial performance comparisons in Table 2, we expect that targets are
acquired due to poor financial profiles, such that improving financial ratios
increase the relative probability to become an acquirer.
We measure the capitalization of a bank by the ratio of total capital reserves to
22 CAMEL profiles consists of a list of (financial) indicators used by the U.S. Federal
Reserve Bank to rate banks. Examples of studies employing CAMEL covariates
are Stuhr and Van Wicklen (1974), Sinkey (1975), Korobrow, Stuhr, and Martin
(1977), Whalen and Thomson (1988), Wheelock and Wilson (2000), and Gilbert et
al. (1999).
23 The universe of financial ratios that are potential candidates for study is far
larger than our final selection. Piloff and Santomero (1998) point out the impor-
tance of acknowledging the lack of a theoretical model in this respect. They argue
that rationalization of mergers is frequently subject to different perspectives by in-
terested parties. For example, bankers consistently motivate mergers by citing scale
economies. But empirical evidence fails to confirm this motivation. Given the lack
of theoretical guidance, we follow the selection approach outlined in Hosmer and
Lemeshow (2000). In brief, we collected a long list of about 200 ratios, for which we
inspect descriptive and graphical evidence that indicates discriminatory power. We
examine each variable's univariate explanatory power in binomial logit analysis for
each event. Based on this information criterion, we organized a short list of variables
into CAMEL categories. We then employed this reduced covariate vector in a multi-
variate logit per event category using stepwise regression. From this further reduced
vector we chose a set of final covariates based on their economic meaningfulness.
24 We also tested longer lags, but one-year lags yielded stronger discriminatory
power.

total assets, c1
. 25 The mean capitalization ratio is relatively low for the groups
DT, I, and DA, and relatively high for the groups T, A and O. Reserves provide
an important buffer for banks to absorb (for example) a sudden drop in the
market value of securities or other non-traded assets (Hughes and Mester,
1993). An increase in this buffer may reduce the probability of belonging
to a distressed group or becoming a voluntary target, unless cherry picking
occurs, which would have the opposite effect. Likewise, we expect that higher
capitalization leads to an increased probability of voluntarily acquiring another
bank.
To capture the influence of asset quality on mergers, we construct four ra-
tios. Our first covariate is the ratio of securities to risk-weighted assets, a1
.
Presumably, banks with higher proportions of securities have higher asset
diversification and lower overall asset risk. Table 2 indicates that all banks
involved in events (but especially distressed banks) have shares of securities
that are on average below that of the control group. For this reason we expect
25 Our univariate and stepwise variable selection process favored the use of gross to-
tal assets as a denominator compared to risk-weighted assets, Basle equity ratios, or
total equity. We capture the influence of risk in the asset quality category discussed
shortly.
13
that an increase in a1
leads to lower probabilities of distressed events. Also,
the probability of becoming a non-distressed target (acquirer) is likely to be
smaller (larger) after an increase in a1
.
To proxy credit risk in the loan portfolio, we employ two ratios. First, we
use the ratio of net loan loss provisions to total customer credits, a2
. This
ratio captures actual credit losses suffered during the pre-event period. Banks
involved in voluntary mergers as well as non-merging banks have low and
approximately equal mean levels of net loan loss provision. For distressed ac-
quirers and banks receiving regulatory attention, this variable is substantially
higher, while it is highest for distressed targets. Higher losses increase the
likelihood of distress and voluntary targets but are expected to decrease the
probability of acquiring another bank. The second credit risk covariate, a3
, is
the ratio of loans with higher latent risks according to the Bundesbank audit
reports relative to total audited loans. This variable is a stock variable and
therefore captures the long-run risk profile of the bank when granting credit.
In terms of mean levels, a similar dichotomy holds. Non-distressed banks as
well as non-merging banks have a low share of latent risk loans, whereas the
other groups have a relatively high share. Banks that are subject to regulatory
attention (I) have the highest share of latent risk loans. Our expectations with
regard to a3
are the same as for a2
.
Our final asset quality covariate is annual asset growth, a4
. This variable cap-
tures the risk of either expanding business activities too rapidly (to manage
growth prudently) or too slowly (to keep pace with competitive pressures).
Sample mean growth rates shown in Table 2 for all categories are below the
mean of non-merging banks, especially both groups of targets and banks re-
ceiving intervention only. Hence, we expect that increases in this covariate lead
to lower probabilities of becoming involved in distressed and non-distressed
events.
To proxy for managerial skill, many studies employ key performance indi-
cators, such as cost-income ratios (e.g., see Rhoades, 1993). We argue that
such covariates are an inferior proxy for two reasons. First, these measures are
prone to accounting rule-induced distortions. For example, we know that cost
income ratios of savings banks are systematically below average due to fund-
ing advantages associated with government ownership. Second, these ratios
might reflect market circumstances, rather than managerial skill. If, for exam-
ple, an idiosyncratic shock hits a region, cost-income ratios will rise. Clearly,
such a ratio does not proxy for management quality. As an alternative, we
employ profit and cost efficiency estimates, m1
and m2
. These measures are
derived from a bank production model using stochastic frontier analysis. 26 In
this model observed costs (profits) can differ from estimated best-practice cost
26 The appendix provides technical details.
14
(profits) for two reasons: (i) deviations can be attributable to random noise
(e.g., measurement error); and (ii) deviations can result from systematically
employing sub-optimal combinations of input quantities to produce outputs,
thereby leading the bank to incur too high costs (too low profits). The lat-
ter deviations are due to inefficiency and proxy (lack of) managerial skill. 27
Note that two banks exhibiting identical returns on equity can be different in
terms of employing in- and outputs in the correct proportion to realize that
profit. 28 From Table 2, we observe that acquiring banks and banks in the con-
trol group both exhibit high profit and cost efficiency, while distressed banks
have low profit and cost efficiency. Banks in the voluntary target group have
on average relatively low profit efficiency but high cost efficiency. We expect
that an increase in efficiency is associated with a lower probability of distress.
Regarding non-distressed events, decreased (increased) efficiency is expected
to correspond to a higher probability of being a target (acquirer).
To measure earnings we use operating return over risk-weighted assets, e1.
This covariate measures profitability on a risk-adjusted basis. Again, distressed
banks have low earnings ratios, non-distressed banks have relatively high earn-
ings ratios. We expect that higher earnings decrease the chances of distress.
Likewise, we expect an increase of earnings to render a bank more (less) likely
to be an acquirer (target).
The final CAMEL covariate refers to the liquidity position of a given bank. We
use the ratio equal to the sum of cash and inter-bank assets to risk-weighted
assets, l1
. 29 Liquidity is a buffer, and can help absorb sudden cash-outflows.
Mean liquidity in distressed target banks is very high, while in acquiring banks
and non-merging banks it is quite low. Mean liquidity of the other groups falls
in between. However, excessive cash holdings imply poor returns as these assets
normally have low yields. Thus, the effect of an increase in liquidity depends
on the level of liquidity holdings.
Table 2 indicates that distressed and non-distressed targets exhibit higher
average liquidity than non-merging banks. Hence, we expect an increase of
liquidity to result in a higher probability of being involved in a distressed
event and becoming a non-distressed target. Likewise, we expect that the
probability of acquiring another bank is lower.
27 For a comprehensive discussion of alternative frontier models, we refer the reader
to Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000).
28 Put differently, the inefficient bank might have realized higher returns with the
observed input-output combination at its disposal.
29 A preferable alternative would have been the Principle II liquidity ratio that
is reported for each bank in the supervision departments audit report (Deutsche
Bundesbank, 2002). Unfortunately, data for this ratio were not available before
1998.
15
In addition to bank-specific financial profiles, Porath (2004) emphasizes the
importance of macroeconomic conditions on bank performance. Our first macro-
economic variable captures the private sector by GDP per capita, GDP. The
variation in mean levels of GDP per capita across groups is low. We expect that
distress is less likely under good economic conditions. Higher income fosters
demand for financial products. Also, outstanding assets (e.g. customer loans)
are at lower risk of failing. To capture the effect of economic conditions in the
business sector on bank merger probability, we also include the percentage of
insolvent non-financial firms, INS. Mean levels of insolvency ratios are high for
all distressed banks, and relatively low for the non-distressed banks. As the
commercial customer base of banks suffers from adverse economic conditions,
we expect that banks will be increasingly exposed to distress. 30
A number of studies on bank mergers (Worthington, 2004; Wheelock and
Wilson, 2000; Cole and Gunther, 1995; DeYoung, 2003) find that larger banks
are less likely to be taken over. To account for differences in size, we include
the log of risk-weighted total assets, RWA, as a final bank characteristic.
The most important observation with regard to differences in mean levels of
risk-weighted assets is not between distressed and non-distressed banks, but
between targets and acquirers. The average size of target banks is substantially
lower than that of all other banks. 31
4 Results
We begin this section by assessing the appropriateness of our choice of co-
variates. Next, we provide results for the multinomial logit model. Finally, we
test for differences between distressed and non-distressed events and between
acquirers and targets, respectively.
4.1 Explanatory power
Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) suggest various approaches for evaluating the
explanatory power of logit models. Since the primary interest of this study is
30 The principle of the so-called Hausbank approach together with relationship lend-
ing is confirmed by Elsass and Krahnen (2004). They find that savings and coopera-
tive banks ". . . develop an informationally intense relationship with their customers,
and that these special relationships are common among mid-sized firms."
31 We also include indicator variables for the respective year and banking group to
control for systematic differences between the two groups in terms of size, business
focus, and sheer number of banks (and events).
16
to identify a financial profile that discriminates between distressed and non-
distressed merger events, we wish to find the set of covariates that categorizes
observations with highest possible accuracy. 32 Given that we estimate a con-
tinuous probability that events fall into discrete categories, the discriminatory
power of our model depends on the cutoff probability level beyond which pre-
dicted values are assigned to a specific group.
To evaluate the discriminatory power of the model over a range of cutoff lev-
els, we employ the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)
curve. The area under the ROC curve (AUR) measures the percentage of
correctly classified events (sensitivity) versus one minus the percentage of cor-
rectly classified non-events (specificity). According to Hosmer and Lemeshow,
AUR values between 0.6 and 0.7 are acceptable, values between 0.7 and 0.8
are good, and higher values are outstanding. 33

bination of event and reference group. Columns coincide with event groups and
rows with the respective control group. Estimations for distressed acquirers

of sample testing.
33 Note that perfect discrimination is not possible as it would prohibit estimation.

is consistent with Begg and Gray (1984) and Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000).
17
(DA), voluntary targets (T), voluntary acquirers (A), and intervention only (I)
control groups exclude non-event observations. AUR values between 0.826 and
0.964 indicate that our model is well suited to differentiate distressed targets
from distressed acquirers, voluntary mergers, and interventions, respectively.
Also note that the standard errors of the AUR values are fairly low. From this
evidence we infer that the chances of becoming a distressed target is explained
quite well by the covariates. At the bottom of Table 3, we also provide results
from a single logit model predicting distressed targets relative to a reference
group of strictly non-merging banks. 35 The AUR value of 0.943 is in line
with other information criteria (e.g., a pseudo R2 of 0.447) and supports the
explanatory power of the model. 36
We obtain similar results when modeling distressed acquirers as an event
group. Depending on the choice of a reference group, AUR values (in col-
umn DA) range between 0.826 and 0.924 and again have low standard errors.
Hence, the ability of our covariates to identify distressed acquirers is fairly
strong.
For the two voluntary merger events, T and A, the explanatory power of
our model is slightly lower. Nonetheless, AUR values ranging from 0.772 and
0.864 support the inference that the covariates can explain different merger
events. 37 Lastly, we find AUR values close to 0.9 for interventions without
a later merger, which means that the covariates explain these events fairly
accurately despite a relatively low number of observations.
4.2 Degrees of difference
In this section we discuss the multinomial logit model results. In Table 4
we report RRR scores for each event. The reference group consists of bank
35 Note that, unlike the multinomial model, this model excludes non-event observa-
tions that later merge from the control group.
36 Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) caution not to rely entirely on R2. The assess-
ment of a model's goodness-of-fit should examine how well the choice of covariates
can predict an event to occur and the ability of the model to correctly classify an
observation as event or non-event.
37 We also estimated our model with single covariates, and found that only four out
of twelve covariates exhibit AUR values as high as 0.6. These results are available
upon request. We further test whether the difference of financial ratios' means is
significant. Given the non-normality of financial ratios, we use a Kruskall-Wallis
test (1952a, 1952b) and find for each variable that at least one difference between
groups is significantly different from zero.
18
observations without any event. 38 Since we are interested in whether the entire
financial profile for each group significantly predicts the type of event, for each
group we test the null hypothesis that all coefficients are simultaneously equal
to zero. Reported Wald test statistics yield significant financial profiles for all
groups. Recall that the reported RRR measures the change in the probability
of membership in one group relative to the probability of not merging at all
for a one-unit change of the variable.

Unless otherwise indicated, all variables are measured in percentages. For ex-
ample, an RRR of 1.6 for net loan loss provisions of distressed targets implies
that a one percentage point increase in this variable leads to a 60% higher
probability of becoming a distressed target relative to not merging at all.
We compare each covariate's influence as captured by RRR across the event
groups.
We hypothesized that an increase of c1

distressed events and non-distressed targets and implies a higher probability

of becoming an acquirer. Our results generally confirm this hypothesis. In
addition, the sensitivity to changes in capitalization is highest for the group of
distressed targets, followed by the intervention group and distressed acquirers.
In four out of five cases, the RRR score is significantly different from one, with
the correct sign. The modest sensitivity for the group of voluntary targets does
not support the existence of a strong cherry picking effect. While the RRR
for the group of non-distressed acquirer is in line with expectations, it is not
significantly different from one.
Next we consider asset quality. With respect to the security share, a1
, we hy-
pothesized earlier an increase to yield lower probabilities for distressed events
and voluntary targets. Also, we expected a higher probability for acquisitions
to occur as a consequence of such a change. Table 4 shows that the estimated
RRRs for the security share variable are between 0.96 and 0.99. Estimates
are significant for all groups except for those banks that receive intervention
without subsequent merger activities. The magnitude of the sensitivity shows
that this effect is quantitatively unimportant. Contrary to our expectation,
the probability of becoming a voluntary acquirer is negatively influenced by
the security share. A tentative explanation of the result that higher security
shares lower the probability of being involved in any merger may be that espe-
cially larger banks tend to hold high security shares and remain independent.
This requires further research.
According to Greve (2002), cooperative (and savings) banks have traditionally
focused on providing credit finance to small commercial and private borrow-
ers. Increasing competition has reduced interest margins and rendered these
activities unattractive (Molyneux et al., 1996). The monthly reports of the
Deutsche Bundesbank (2003) confirm this development. We suspect that the
growing need to generate income from alternative sources caused some banks
to expand their securities trading activities. The impact of an increase in the
share of securities is identical across all merger events in terms of direction,
which may reflect this trend.
An increase in the net loan loss provision, a2
, is expected to increase the prob-
ability of becoming distressed and becoming a target, while it is expected to
decrease the probability of becoming an acquirer. This is confirmed by signif-
icant RRRs above one for all groups except non-distressed acquirers. We find
no significant effect of loan loss provision changes on the likelihood of becom-
ing an acquirer. An increase by one percentage point of a2
results in a 150%
increase in the probability of being involved in a distressed event. Thus, this
measure is among the more important determinants of mergers in Germany.
High sensitivities of increasing a2
for distressed events are in line with common
practice in the literature that defines distress on the basis of this indicator.
Significantly higher mean loan loss provisions (see Table 2) tend to trigger
regulatory attention. Non-distressed targets may be motivated to merge by
20
their respective head organization in order to avoid further regulatory atten-
tion. The necessity for increased write-offs could indicate adverse conditions
(e.g., a harvest in a particular region lost due to flood). 39 The insignificant
RRR for acquirers implies that net loan loss provisions for these banks are
not substantially different from those of non-merging banks. Consequently,
this observation does not support the notion that acquirers are financially
healthier banks compared to the non-merging bank population.
We expect a higher share of latent risk loans a3
to increase the probability of
becoming distressed and voluntary targets and to decrease the probability of
acquiring another bank. The RRR is insignificant for both distressed and non-
distressed acquirers. The sensitivity for the remaining groups is substantially
lower compared to RRR for a2
. We therefore conclude that latent risk loans,
a3
, are a less important indicator of distressed events than loan loss provisions,
a2
. Again, no evidence in favor of cherry picking is found.
We expect higher asset growth rates, a4
to imply lower probabilities of being
involved in distressed events. In addition, we expect higher growth rates to de-
crease the probability of being a voluntary target and increase the probability
of being a voluntary acquirer. Table 4 shows that RRR estimates for annual
growth of total assets, a4
, are below one for both distressed and voluntary
mergers. This implies that an increase in the growth rate leads to a lower like-
lihood of merging. With the exception of distressed acquirers, all RRRs are
significantly different from one. As found previously, the sensitivity to changes
in growth is largest for group DT but the difference from group T is small. The
evidence indicates that savings and cooperative banks prefer internal growth
strategies. Only if internal growth is too slow is an acquisition considered as
a means of growing in line with non-distressed competitors. In sum, we infer
that banks that experience below average growth are more likely to merge.
Exceptionally low growth is associated with becoming a target in a merger.
Decreasing cost and profit efficiency are expected to lead to higher probabilities
of becoming involved in a distressed event and becoming a target. This is in
line with the efficient management hypothesis, which states that owners will
ultimately replace managers that employ scarce resources inefficiently with
more competent personnel (e.g., see Roll, 1986).
In Table 4, we see that estimates of the RRRs for profit and cost efficiency,
m1
and m2
, are significantly below one for all distressed events. This supports
the hypothesis that higher efficiency decreases the chances of experiencing a
distressed event. Cost efficiency RRRs are lower than profit efficiency RRRs
among distressed banks. Moreover, the estimated RRR for non-distressed tar-
gets significantly less than one suggests that profit efficiency influences the

21
probability of falling into group T. The sensitivity is relatively small at an
RRR of 0.984 but is identical to that of distressed mergers.
Together, the results for m1
and m2
lend some support for the efficient manage-
ment hypothesis, despite the absence of an equity-based market for corporate
control. The fact that lower efficiency increases the probability of becoming a
voluntary target suggest that non-distressed institutions merge to forestall reg-
ulatory intervention. In this regard, while local savings and cooperative banks
are not legally required to comply with their respective head organizations,
our results suggest that they likely play a role in the merger process. 40
We expect that increased earnings lead to a lower probability of distress and
takeover and a higher probability of acquiring another bank. Our estimates
for RRRs for earnings, e1
, are consistent with these expectations. Sensitivity
is highest for interventions only, followed by distressed targets, and distressed
acquirers. In fact, this covariate discriminates quite well between all event
groups, with the exception of non-distressed targets. For both non-distressed
events we find that higher earnings increase the probability of merging.
We expect that increases of cash and inter-bank assets, l1
, increase the prob-
ability of becoming involved in a distressed merger or becoming a voluntary
target. Assuming that acquirers are capable of better cash-management, we
expect the opposite effect for this group. The RRR is significant for all non-
distressed events and for distressed targets. The direction of the effect is con-
sistent with our hypotheses, but small in magnitude.
We have few priors as to whether distressed and non-distressed mergers are
more or less likely to occur in relatively wealthy areas. Our results show that
the RRR of state GDP per capita is significantly below one for both non-
distressed events and for distressed acquirers. In adition, the magnitude of
these RRRs suggests that this covariate is an important determinant of merger
activity. Perhaps this variable captures the different stages in the consolidation
process in the wealthy western states and the relatively poor eastern states.
We expect higher insolvency ratios to increase the probability of distressed
events and to decrease the probability of voluntary mergers. Our results indi-
cate that insolvencies only have significant effect on the probability of being
involved in a non-distressed merger. Only insignificant effects are found for
distressed events.
40 Siebert (2004) and others have argued that corporate governance in Germany
follows principles of co-determination and consensus rather than reliance on market
mechanisms. Wengerer and Kaserer (1998) point out that this corporate governance
system may shield bank managers from the threat of being replaced by a more
efficient management. Our evidence does not support these arguments.
22
Our last covariate measures the size of the banking firm. We hypothesize
that large firms are more likely to become acquirers than targets. The RRR
scores are large and significant for all groups and discriminates especially well
between targets and acquirers. More specifically, an increase in size by one
million euros implies a bank is almost twice as likely to become an acquirer.
By contrast, chances of becoming a target are almost halved. This relation
is identical in direction for both distressed and non-distressed events. Thus,
both in distressed and non-distressed transactions, sheer size is an important
determinant of whether a merging bank is a surviving (acquiring) or ceasing
(acquired) institution.
Our multinomial logit model results can be summarized as follows. Financial
profiles can explain merger events with high accuracy. Distressed events are
different from non-distressed events, and acquirers are different from targets.
However, differences between groups are reflected to a greater extent in the
magnitude of effects rather than their direction. 41 The covariates that show
the largest absolute and relatively sensitivities and thus are most important
in explaining different events and discriminating between groups, are capital-
ization net loan loss provision, earnings and size.
4.3 Significance of differences
Given that the differences between estimated RRRs are relatively small, a nat-
ural question is whether sensitivities differ significantly between groups. While
the tests conducted so far reject the hypothesis that respective groups' pro-
files are jointly equal to zero, it remains unclear if single covariate and entire
profile effects are different between groups. We tackle this issue by examining
whether single covariates and entire financial profiles differ significantly be-
tween distressed and non-distressed mergers, as well as between acquirers and
targets. 42
To this end, we report four different tests. First, we test whether each co-
variate's RRR is equal for the distressed and non-distressed targets. Second,
we test whether the RRR for each single covariate is equal for distressed and
non-distressed acquirers. Third, we test whether the RRR for each single co-
variate is equal for distressed targets and distressed acquirers. Fourth, we test
whether the RRR for each single covariate is equal for voluntary targets and
41 In this respect, our results nicely complement Oshinsky and Olin (2005), who
report similar findings when comparing recovery, mergers and continuation.
42 We also tested all possible combinations between groups that are presented in
Table 1 (i.e., nine combinations). In tests of equality between DT versus I and DA
versus I, five out of twelve covariates are significantly different. Results are available
upon request.

voluntary acquirers. 43 Table 5 reports the p values of Wald tests for these
four hypotheses.
We start by comparing distressed and non-distressed mergers. Regarding tar-
gets, most RRRs are significantly different from each other at the 1% level.
The difference in liquidity, however, is significant only at the 10% confidence
level. The variables asset growth, profit efficiency, and GDP per capita are no
different for targets merging with and without distress. Overall, the last row
indicates that the RRRs of distressed targets are significantly different from
those of non-distressed targets. These results demonstrate the importance of
differentiating between merger targets on the basis of distress.
Turning to the results for acquirers, five out of twelve covariates have RRRs
that are not significantly different between distressed and non-distressed ac-
quirers. In addition to the previously identified three covariates, the share
of loans with higher latent risks and bank size are no different between the

ers (abstracting from whether a bank was target or acquirer). Our results stay

24
two groups. The fact that the remaining seven covariates differ significantly
between the two groups explains why the hypothesis of joint equality of all pa-
rameters is rejected. We infer that non-distressed acquirers have significantly
stronger financial profiles than distressed acquirers.
Next, we compare acquirers and targets. In Table 5 we report tests of whether
the RRRs of (distressed) targets and acquirers are equal. The p-values of Wald
tests for each covariate and the all CAMEL covariates are provided there. In
general, half of the covariates' effects differ significantly between distressed
targets and acquirers. The estimated RRRs for net loan loss provision, the
two efficiency measures, return on RWA, liquidity and the insolvency ratio do
not differ significantly. On the other hand, we find that capitalization ratios,
security shares, asset growth, latent risk loan share and size are significantly
different between the two groups.
The importance of accounting for different financial profiles is more pro-
nounced among non-distressed mergers. In Table 5, all but two covariates are
significantly different between voluntary targets and acquirers. The last row
shows that all covariates are also jointly significantly different. We infer that
voluntary targets have financial profiles that are more like distressed banks
than like other non-distressed banks.
Overall, the conclusion must be that focussing only on distressed versus non-
distressed banks is insufficient in a merger analysis. In addition, targets and
acquirers have significantly different financial profiles and sensitivities to ex-
planatory variables.
5 Conclusion
This paper investigates the possible bias that exists in studies of bank merger
determinants when not appropriately controlling for the existence of hidden
bailouts. We distinguish between five possible events, including distressed tar-
gets and acquirers, non-distressed targets and acquirers, and banks subject
to only regulatory intervention. After specifying a vector of bank-specific and
environmental covariates, we estimate a multinomial logit model in order to
predict the probability of becoming a (distressed) target, a (distressed) ac-
quirer, or a bank that experiences intervention but continues to exist.
We find some evidence that supports the efficient management hypothesis. By
implication, regulatory authorities and head organizations of cooperative and
savings banks appear to play important roles in the disposition of distressed
German bank mergers. Despite sharing below average profiles, merging banks
that are targets are different from acquirers. The probability of entering a
25
specific group is largely determined by sheer size and to a lesser extent by
capitalization. In general, larger banks that experienced intervention later be-
came an acquirer (rather than target) in subsequent mergers. Hence, size is the
crucial factor that determines the role a merging bank assumes in the merger.
More importantly, both distressed and non-distressed merging banks have
lower capital reserve ratios than non-merging banks, lower exposure to se-
curities business, higher credit risk as measured by net loan loss provisioning,
and below average efficiency. Sensitivities to changes in these covariates are
normally of a lesser magnitude for voluntary mergers, but the direction of co-
variates' impact on distressed and non-distressed events is identical for nine
out of twelve covariates. Even for voluntary acquirers, we find only limited ev-
idence that improving financial profiles increases the probability of belonging
to this group.
Our results provide evidence that merger events in general are more likely
to occur among banks that exhibit relatively bad financial profiles. For dis-
tressed mergers this finding is consistent with expectations. However, we also
find that non-distressed mergers involve underperforming banks, which may
mean that voluntary mergers are motivated by pre-emptive distress resolution
considerations, rather than cherry picking of top performing banks. It also
confirms the findings of Rhodes-Kropf and Robinson (2004), who find that
mergers typically pair together firms that perform similarly, compared to the
market.
We conclude from these findings that the recent consolidation in German
banking is associated with underperforming target and acquirer institutions
perhaps seeking to avoid potential future financial distress. Given that a con-
siderable portion of non-distressed mergers may have been motivated by the
intention to avoid more severe problems, we consider an analysis of the success
of both distressed and non-distressed mergers an important topic for future
research.

Appendix: Measurement of managerial skill
We employ stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to measure X-efficiency relative
to cost and profit frontiers. 44 According to Leibenstein (1966), X-efficiency
measures the amount of waste incurred due to sub-optimal management choices.
We therefore use cost and profit efficiency to proxy for managerial skill. To
conserve space we only overview the cost model. 45 We assume that banks min-
imize costs, operate in perfect markets, 46 and produce inputs and outputs per
the intermediation approach 47 .
We define three outputs ym
subject to fixed prices. Banks choose input quanti-
ties given factor costs. We specify three inputs purchased at prices t
i
. For bank
k input-output combinations are produced at observed costs Ck
. 48 Following
Hughes and Mester (1993), we specify equity capital z to account for different
risk profiles of banks. Output quantities and input prices are obtained from
Bundesbank accounts for cooperative and savings banks for the years 1993 to
2003. Descriptive statistics are in Table 6.
Output quantities are year-end stocks. We calculate input prices as factor pay-
ments divided by input quantities. The price of fixed assets equals depreciation
over fixed assets, the price of labor equals personnel expenses over number of
full time equivalent employees, and the price of borrowed funds equals interest
expense over total borrowed funds, respectively.
Following Lang and Welzel (1966), we use a translog functional form including
a time trend variables. The cost frontier is written as: 49
ln TOCk
(w, y, z) = a0

44 SFA was developed by Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977), Meeusen and van der
Broek (1977), and Battesse and Corra (1977). Studies applying it to study the
ex-post effects of merger include Kohers et al. (2000) and Akhavein et al. (1997).
45 Since the profit model is analogous, we use footnotes to review methodological
differences.
46 For the profit model we follow the alternative profit approach proposed by
Humphrey and Pulley (1997). In brief, banks continue to face perfect input markets,
but on the output side they are allowed limited price discretion as reflected by an
additional pricing opportunity constraint in the maximization problem.
47 For a discussion of bank production, see Freixas and Rochet (1997).
48 In the alternative profit approach the dependent variable is profits before tax, or
PBTk
.
49 We use maximum likelihood estimation to obtain both parameter estimates for
equation (3) and the error components. We impose homogeneity of degree one in
input prices and symmetry, following Lang and Welzel (1996).

trend t. The composed error k
consists of random noise component, v, and a
systematic inefficiency component labeled u. Following Stevenson (1980), we
assume that the random component v is i.i.d. N(0, v
). For the inefficiency
part we assume that u is i.i.d. N|(µ, u
)|. As cost inefficient banks operate
above the efficient frontier the latter term is added to random deviations,
resulting in a composed error of the form k
= vk
+ uk
.
After estimation of the cost and profit frontier we use the approach suggested
by Jondrow et al. (1982) to derive firm-specific efficiency estimates. We obtain
firm-specific efficiency estimates as the expected value of inefficiency condi-
tional on total error. Like Coelli et al. (1998), we calculate efficiency scores by
using:
TEk
= [exp(-^
uk
)] .
The estimated cost and profit efficiency scores are referred to as CAMEL
covariates m1
and m2
, respectively.
