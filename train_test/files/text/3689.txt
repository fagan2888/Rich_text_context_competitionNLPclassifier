Temporalities of human­
livestock relationships
in the late prehistory
of the southern Levant

Abstract
The secondary products revolution is re-appraised here as a critical process in human
history that created durable and enduring relationships between people and their live-
stock. The secondary products revolution is conventionally described in terms of agri-
cultural intensification and a step towards urban development. This process marks a
shift from a strategy in which most animals are culled when they reach an optimal
weight, which for ruminants occurs relatively early in life, to one in which individual
animals are selected for their potential to yield one or more renewable products over
the course of life and raised until they can no longer produce secondary products,
which tends to occur in adulthood. This new mode of practice placed individual mem-
bers of two species on an intersubjective ontological plane and, moreover, spelled a shift
in the temporality of human­livestock relations. This paper draws out the consequences
of these ever-closer relationships in the course of human efforts to exploit renewable
resources from domesticated animals. In particular, secondary products exploitation
extended the lives of lactating female stock, sheep and goats desired for their fibres,
oxen engaged in ploughing and donkeys working as pack animals. In this paper, the
implications of these new long-term human­animal relationships, which originated
and intensified sporadically in different regions of the Near East starting as early as
the Neolithic, are discussed in light of the new temporality that attended practices of
long-term stock-keeping. This model is examined in light of zooarchaeological,

One day the Cogia laying hold on a crane, took it home, and saying that its beak and
feet were very long, cut them off with a knife; and placing it on a lofty place, said,
`Now you look like a bird'.
Nasreddin
Introduction
Nasreddin Hoca, the 13th-century Sufi philosopher and folk hero, provides this
satirical anecdote. Nasreddin could not fathom the crane as a bird because it had a
seemingly unsuitable physicality for flight. His good intention of truncating the
crane's non-bird-like parts would have produced an animal that, although bearing
a semblance to more familiar birds, would have ceased to be a whole bird.
Nasreddin's mistake was in not recognising the crane as a unified organism con-
stituted by interdependent anatomical parts, none of which functions without the
others. This allegory is apt for what follows, superficially because its subject is an
animal, but critically because it illustrates a normative attitude towards an animal.
The character in the tale carries with him a priori notions of how a bird should be
structured. He is either unable or unwilling to shed these assumptions when he
encounters a species with which he is unfamiliar.
In a similar vein, the human perception of non-human animals in the modern
urban environment is equally weak. Although scientists have gained profound
knowledge of animals through developments in the fields of evolutionary biology,
systematics and ecology, the majority of urban denizens fail to notice, let alone
interact with, most of the animals that live among them (Waldau, 2013: 222). This
disengagement from animals has produced a set of ontological assumptions that
hold humans in contradistinction to other animals. In fact, the entire anthropo-
logical enterprise is based on the premise that humans are exceptional among ani-
mals and therefore merit a field of study devoted to understanding their unique role
in the world.
This particular perspective on animals is a product of dualist ontology, itself an
outgrowth of post-Enlightenment thought. People in the past and contemporary
people living at the margins of the Western world have conceptualised animals in a
myriad of forms. The ways that people relate to animals are as variable as the ways
Allentuck 95
that people relate to one another (Ingold, 1988: 1). As beings or objects, animals
are employed as subsistence resources, capital, companions, predators, prey and
kin. As ideas, animals are regarded as metaphors of social relations, morality,
wealth, prestige, triumph and violence. The diversity of attitudes towards animals
that this short list exemplifies makes clear the difficulty of interpreting the behav-
iours towards and meanings of an animal species from the archaeological past. To
understand how people in the past related to animals is an exercise in teasing out
historically located logics. In cases for which communities represented animals in
text or art, this exercise is feasible. However, it is daunting for zooarchaeologists
who are tasked with gaining historically specific knowledge of animals from pre-
historic communities that only left for posterity the biological remains of their
animals, since animal remains are conventionally thought to be silent on these
matters.
From the outset, it is critical that I make clear my use of the word animal. On its
face, the term is simple and familiar and should not be a source of debate.
However, the anthropological and archaeological literature on human­animal rela-
tions contains two categorically different, but often conflated, animal connotations:
one that refers to the physical organism (i.e. an animal being) and the other refers
to a metaphysical representation of the organism (i.e. the Animal Spirit or Master
of Animals known from Mesopotamian history and Amazonian ethnography). At
the risk of perpetuating a potentially false dichotomy between reality and repre-
sentation, it is nonetheless essential to define the topic at hand. My concern is with
the flesh-and-blood animal, which produced an objective reality in the past, and
moreover, a posthumous expression suitable for archaeological enquiry.
Human­animal relations may be broadly understood as the interactions, both
literal and representational, between humans and other animals. Throughout its
history, zooarchaeology has been principally concerned with questions of human­
animal relations, such as hunting strategy, domestication, animal husbandry and
animal sacrifice. Zooarchaeologists, however, have only recently embraced the
`animal turn' that now pervades much cross-disciplinary research in the humanities
and social sciences. In fact, zooarchaeology, as a largely methods-driven discipline,
remains firmly rooted in addressing questions of basic subsistence with an expand-
ing and increasingly exacting repertoire of analytical techniques based in biological
science. The slow of reaction of zooarchaeology to engage with emerging research
produced in other disciplines, such as ethology, cognitive sciences, philosophy and
anthropology, urges us to redress this long-standing insularity (for a notable excep-
tion see Russell, 2012).
This paper seeks to draw out the consequences of the ever-closer relationships
that developed between people and livestock in the course of human efforts to
exploit renewable resources, such as milk, fibre and traction, from livestock. The
emergence of these innovations, which occurred sporadically in different regions of
the Near East from the Neolithic to Early Bronze (EB) Age, has come to be known
collectively as the secondary products revolution (SPR). The phenomenon refers to
a series of agricultural subsistence changes that initially saw livestock exploited
96 Journal of Social Archaeology 15(1)
solely or primarily for their primary products (i.e. meat, hide and bone) to a sub-
sequently expanded set of practices for extracting renewable secondary products.
While the SPR is conventionally couched in terms of agricultural intensification
and a stage in the process of urban expansion in the Near East and Europe
(Greenfield, 1988, 2010; Sherratt, 1983), this paper presents a complementary per-
spective that discusses the implications of the new temporality that attended prac-
tices of long-term stock-keeping.
The development of human­livestock co-dependence
Animal domestication
Definitions of animal domestication are numerous and diverse, but this is mostly a
consequence of individual researchers choosing to emphasise different aspects of
the domestication concept (see Russell, 2002; Zeder, 2012 for thorough reviews).
All agree that domestication was a redefining process for human­animal relations,
but difference of opinion rests on the significance of the locus of change, whether
biological or social. One popular view focuses on the apparent imbalance that
characterises the relationship of masterful humans who control selection, taming,
breeding and feeding of submissive animal domesticates (Bo
¨ ko
¨ nyi, 1989;
Clutton-Brock, 1994; Ingold, 1996). Another perspective emphasises domestication
as a marked shift in resource focus from products of dead animals to maintaining
the essential products of living animals: their progeny (Meadow, 1993: 296). Others
prefer to emphasise that domestication was not a one-sided process. Rather,
humans and animals selected each other by entering into mutualistic relationships
that were adaptively beneficial for both species (O'Connor, 1997: 152­153).
Discussions of the social side of domestication tend to explain the phenomenon
in terms of a shift in perception from animal categories (species) to individuals
(Ducos, 1978). Still others hold the opposite view that a shift in perception from
individual prey to the entire herd occurred alongside the domestication process
(Mlekuz
 , 2013). Zeder (2006: 107) describes biological aspects of the human­
domesticate relationship as one of asymmetrical mutualism. Here, domestication
is mutualistic since both humans and domesticates increase their reproductive fit-
ness, but asymmetrical because humans alone have the capacity for social learning
through knowledge transmission.
Secondary products
Since the Neolithic, people living in temperate regions of the Near East primarily
relied upon four principal livestock species ­ sheep, goat, cattle and pig. Before the
emergence of dairying, these animals were exploited for their meat and other pri-
mary products. However, a decisive modification to human­animal relations
occurred with the origin of dairying, as this critical innovation precipitated changes
in food choices, storability, daily scheduling and many other related realms of
Allentuck 97
practice (Sherratt, 1983). The earliest evidence for secondary products exploitation
is found in milk fat residues from Neolithic (end of the seventh millennium BC)
ceramic vessels (Evershed et al., 2008). The critical question, however, is not the
origin of secondary products exploitation, but the onset of intensive or systematic
secondary products exploitation practices (Greenfield, 2010: 43­44; Isaakidou,
2006: 96). In other words, when did the scale of secondary products exploitation
change to the point of spelling the economic transformation that set the stage for
urban development?
Sherratt (1981, 1983) considered the early appearance of secondary animal prod-
ucts as innovations that were collectively as `revolutionary' as Childe's Neolithic
Revolution that entailed the initial domestication of plants and animals. He coined
the term `Secondary Products Revolution' to encapsulate what he inferred to be a
dramatic subsistence shift from the use of livestock as providers of primary prod-
ucts to the use of livestock as providers of renewable secondary resources. While
primary products require the death of the animal for exploitation, secondary prod-
ucts are repeatedly exploited from an animal over the course of its life (Greenfield,
1988: 573). Sherratt proposed that the intensive dairy, fibre and traction exploit-
ation practices in the Chalcolithic (mid-fifth to mid-fourth millennium BC) had a
revolutionary impact on economic, social and ideological developments in the Near
East, which collectively established the conditions for urbanisation in the EB Age
(mid-fourth to mid-late third millennium BC).
Thirty years later, we now understand that the origin of dairying long predates
the origins of traction and wool exploitation (Evershed et al., 2008; Vigne and
Helmer, 2007) and the timing and geographical spread of secondary products
was variable (Bogucki, 1993; Greenfield, 2010, Marciniak, 2011). Another over-
turned conventional wisdom is the juvenile male slaughtering regime for sheep and
goats, which was long thought to be Neolithic orthodoxy (Payne, 1973). This
strategy aimed to exploit meat from immature male individuals when they achieved
an optimal weight (when the growth rate slowed and the labour and material
resources required to keep them alive were counterbalanced by their value as
meat) and to keep a larger number of mature female individuals for breeding
purposes. However, it is now apparent that early Neolithic livestock managers
engaged in a variety of strategies designed to variously provision meat and propa-
gate the herd. Demographic profiling based on biometric faunal data from pub-
lished sources from across the Neolithic Near East found that the herd
management strategy of culling young male animals for meat provisioning only
became de rigeur after about 7500 BC (Arbuckle and Atici, 2013).
Although the individual innovations of the SPR did not rapidly emerge and
diffuse together as a package as Sherratt initially envisioned, the impact of second-
ary products was transformative for societies that relied upon them. Dairying
provided a means of procuring animal proteins without slaughtering the source.
The ox-drawn plough allowed new agricultural strategies through the cultivation of
previously uncultivable soil types, which expanded the amount of land devoted to
orchard and cereal crops. Equally critical in the Near East was the use of the
98 Journal of Social Archaeology 15(1)
donkey as a pack animal, which allowed more intensive agricultural production
through the mobilisation of agricultural tools, water and harvests.
The nature of human­livestock relations that was established with the advent of
domestication transformed when the scale of secondary products exploitation
intensified. People would have formed distinctive relationships with specialised
livestock animals, as each of the secondary products developed independently in
different places and at different times. Ethnographic literature on pastoral systems
shows that the nature of these relations would have been contingent upon any
number of variables, including the economic and social values of the harvested
product, product yield, and the type, sex, colour and fatness of the animal
(Evans-Pritchard, 1940; Fijn, 2011). Intensive production of secondary products
also facilitated broad social transformations. While dairying is conventionally
lauded as a breakthrough in the exploitation of nutrients and calories (Redding,
1981: Table IX-2; Sherratt, 1981: 284), less commonly recognised is the fact that the
daily dairying schedule engenders physical proximity and a degree of trust between
humans and dairy stock (Armstrong Oma, 2010: 182; McCormick, 1992).
The intensive application of animal traction in the late fourth millennium further
transformed human­livestock relations. While hoe agriculture entailed widespread
community involvement, the ox-drawn plough would have required a smaller
number of specialists to feed and direct draught animals. Specialist handlers work-
ing closely with a limited number of draught livestock entail the formation of
intimate and co-dependent partnerships. Thus, the technology to harness the
strength of cattle and donkeys represented an improvement upon and replacement
of human labour. In economic terms, this innovation freed human labour for
agricultural expansion, craft specialisation and large-scale building projects. In a
similar economic vein, the advent of animal traction and transport produced a
conceptual shift from animals as sources of nutrition to animals as capital assets
(Bogucki, 1993: 498­499). Ungulate domestication in the Neolithic set into motion
a course towards mutual dependence between livestock and people, but the emer-
gence of intensive secondary animal products exploitation firmly established
co-dependency.
The term `co-dependence', along with its permutations, is used repeatedly in this
article and serves three principal purposes: (1) as a linguistic way of transcending
the human­animal boundary; (2) to indicate the relational nature of humans and
animals that lived and worked together; and (3) to emphasise that members of two
species came to rely upon each other to the point of inextricable interconnectedness
(Hodder, 2011). These notions of co-dependency are loosely aligned with ideas
found in Actor­Network Theory (Latour, 1993). In this sense, people and livestock
as well as milk, traction, transport, fibres, ploughs, fields, crop harvests, agricul-
tural tools, water and a host of other material and immaterial components acted in
a relational web of dependency. In the section that follows, I make a case for the
development of co-dependent relationships between secondary products-yielding
livestock and their human keepers in the southern Levant during the Chalcolithic
and EB Age.

Human­livestock relations in the Chalcolithic and EB Age
of the southern Levant
The southern Levant in the period that spans the Late Chalcolithic (c. 4500­3700
cal. BC) to Early Bronze I (EB I) (c. 3700­3100 cal. BC) witnessed key transform-
ations in urban settlement pattern, craft production, water management, land use,
mortuary practice and long-distance exchange relations (Milevski, 2011; Philip,
2001; Regev et al., 2012; Rowan and Golden, 2009). Discussions of these devel-
opments tend to locate their collective importance in providing the conditions
necessary for urban-scale settlement nucleation that developed in EB II­III
(c. 3100­2500 cal. BC) (Finkelstein and Gophna, 1993; Grigson, 1995; Horwitz
and Tchernov, 1989; Joffe, 1993). One of the most dramatic and impactful changes
occurred in the realm of food production. New agropastoral innovations and
intensification of existing ones, such as water management technologies, olive
and grape orchards, plough and pack animals, dairying, and wool production,
altered the landscape and how people moved about this space (Philip, 2003).
These elements became inextricably connected starting in the Chalcolithic and
EB periods, as intensified agropastoral production fostered the frequent commin-
gling of people, livestock, crops and agropastoral technologies such that they
occupied overlapping spatiotemporal contexts in settlements and hinterlands. An
exposition of the pertinent southern Levantine evidence will demonstrate the con-
vergence of these elements in the Chalcolithic and EB periods, and in particular,
the existence of the conditions for human­animal co-dependency.
Supplying secondary products entails high maintenance costs and long-term
relationships with people. We know much from Near Eastern ethnographic litera-
ture about the costs of keeping livestock (e.g. Abu-Rabia, 1994; Kramer, 1982;
Sweet, 1960). In terms of maintenance costs, dairy stock in hot climates such as the
southern Levant may require foddering close to home in order to avoid the risk of
milk spoiling during transport. If kept within the settlement, even if only tempor-
arily, space must be reserved for livestock. Furthermore, enclosures must be built
around this space in order to protect the stock against predators. This appears to
have been the case at the Chalcolithic village of Tel Tsaf in the Jordan Valley
(Figure 1). Micromorphological thin sections from unpaved ground surfaces of
two circular structures revealed clusters of dung spherulites (Hubbard, 2010).
These spherically shaped calcareous particles, formed in the stomachs of animals
and excreted in their dung (Shahack-Gross et al., 2003), indicate that the circular
structures at Tel Tsaf were used as livestock enclosures. The evidence from dung
spherulites shows that not only livestock were kept within the village but also their
pens were located within a few metres of the rectilinear dwellings occupied by
people. A similar form of micromorphological evidence from the Chalcolithic
site of Grar in the northern Negev suggests that animal dung was collected and
used as fuel in a series of three superimposed hearths (Katz et al., 2007). Much like
the evidence from Tel Tsaf, it appears that livestock and people at Grar were living
in sufficiently close proximity for this secondary product to be collected and burned

exploitation, the daily feeding, watering and cleaning interactions between people
and livestock kept at or near the home provide the conditions for intimate social
relations between people and their animals.
Draught cattle that plough agricultural fields require fodder and a large water
supply when they are working, pasture when they are not working and an invest-
ment of several years of rearing and training (Halstead, 1995). Intersecting lines of
zooarchaeological evidence, such as mortality profiles and pathology data, as well
as rare ceramic representations of cattle at work, reflect the importance of cattle in
the Chalcolithic and EB and their likely deployment in traction activities.
Iconographic depictions of cattle are rare in the EB, but a bowl that contains a
clay model of a pair of yoked oxen from a probable EB I context at Tell el-Far'ah
North provides strong evidence that cattle were employed in heavy labour
(Amiran, 1986: 12, Figure 3). Diachronic patterns that track age-at-death data
for cattle from the Neolithic through EB are uncommon. This is a consequence
of at least two intersecting factors: faunal remains have been collected from few
southern Levantine sites comprising more than one Neolithic through EB compo-
nent, and of these few sites, dental and epiphyseal fusion data required to recon-
struct mortality patterns from cattle are so few that statistically sound culling
profiles are often precluded. Yiftahel in the Lower Galilee provides a rare view
of cattle mortality from Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) and early EB I levels,
although the small sample of long bone epiphyses on which the data are based is
small (Horwitz, 1997). Two additional caveats to consider are that epiphyseal
fusion data are inherently biased in favour of fused bones that are more resilient
against taphonomic attrition relative to low-density unfused bones, and fused long
bones signal the minimum age at death, not the actual age at death. With these
provisos in mind, the Yiftahel data imply that cattle were slaughtered sometime
between the ages of two and three years in the PPN, but their longevity increased
slightly in EB I when they were maintained at least to the age of 3.5 years and
possibly beyond (Horwitz, 1997: Figure 17.7). This pattern that emphasises mature
cattle is consistent with milk or traction exploitation, but if one particular product
was emphasised in the PPN or EB I at Yiftahel, the answer is beyond reach of the
evidence.
This diachronic pattern of cattle mortality viewed from a single site in the southern
Levant is complemented in a broad geographic in a meta-analysis of sheep and
goat mortality profiles from the northern Levant and northern Mesopotamia
(Helmer et al., 2007). This study found that most Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)
assemblages reflect a mixed strategy of meat and milk exploitation; Pottery Neolithic-
Chalcolithic assemblages showed high degree of intersite variability, with some
focused on meat and others focused on milk or fibres; and EB assemblages were
focused almost exclusively on secondary products. The results of Helmer et al.
(2007) clearly show that, while a variety of stock management strategies were prac-
tised from the Neolithic through Chalcolithic, by the turn of the EB Age, sheep and
goat across the northern half of the Near East were routinely raised into adulthood.
102 Journal of Social Archaeology 15(1)
With regard to the duration of human­animal relationships, dairy stock must
reach sexual maturity before lactation is possible and draught stock must be
trained for up to several years and males may be castrated before they can be
put to work. Evidence from arthrotic palaeolpathologies is useful for identifying
livestock that reached an age sufficiently advanced to develop such lesions
(Bartosiewicz, 2013: 130­154). Lower limb bone exostoses are lesions associated
with advanced age and these growth deformations are often attributed to long-term
draught exploitation (De Cupere et al., 2000; Higham et al., 1981). A broad
survey of pathologies reported from southern Levantine faunal assemblages span-
ning Neolithic though recent historical periods found that, from the EB onward,
pathologies are exclusively found on livestock species that produce secondary prod-
ucts (sheep, goat, cattle and donkey) (Sapir-Hen et al., 2008). Furthermore, the
work of Sapir-Hen et al. (2008) found that arthrotic pathologies (termed `induced
pathologies' by the authors) are only found on lower limb bones of cattle. While
the database that informs these results is sparse, the available evidence indicates
that cattle reached advanced age and likely incurred these lesions from repetitive
work activities.
In fact, the value of draught power is not entirely located in animal labour itself
but also in the crop harvests from the soils that the animals plough. For cereal
crops, this delayed return may be a matter of seasons, but newly planted orchards
may not produce fruit for several years. Thus, the return on investment for animal
traction is substantially delayed in the context of agricultural production, which
would have contributed to long-term dependencies between people and livestock.
The evidence of orchard crops is critical to a discussion of plough technology, as it
was the replacement of digging stick technology with the plough that allowed
farmers to till formerly uncultivable soil types in the hills of the Mediterranean
forest zone (Finkelstein and Gophna, 1993). The southern Levant offers much
evidence for the domestication and the subsequently swift intensification of
grapes and olives starting in the Chalcolithic. Olive production appears to be
small in scale in the Chalcolithic, but by the EB, evidence for large-scale production
such as storage jars, spouted vessels, querns and mortars is reported from several
sites, including Tell Raka
^ n II, Tel Bet Yerah and Tel Yarmut (Banning, 2007: 222;
De Miroschedji, 1999: 8­9; Esse, 1991: 123­124). The grape appears to have been
domesticated as early as the Chalcolithic, but large-scale production is apparent in
the EB (Miller, 2008). Wine production on a mass scale is most evident in Tomb
U-j at Abydos, Egypt, dated to Naqada IIIA in the Egyptian chronology, which is
coeval with late EB I in the Levantine sequence. This royal tomb contained
approximately 700 southern Levantine-made wine jars, some of which contained
tartaric acid residues, grape pips and preserved grapes (McGovern et al., 1997).
Livestock traction and transport would have been essential to the production
and mobilisation of these fruit crops. Pack donkeys in particular would have been
useful for transporting water, agricultural tools, harvests and various commodities
over short and medium distances (Ovadia, 1992; Philip, 2001: 188) and donkey
caravans may have been responsible for moving copper from Feinan and Sinai to a
Allentuck 103
Mediterranean port or perhaps as far as its foreign recipient (Milevski, 2011:
191­192; Stager, 2001: 632­633). The economic and cultic importance of donkeys
in the EB is well documented in the material record. While equid remains tend to
comprise a minor component of faunal assemblages, their prominence as subjects
in zoomorphic clay figurines suggests that they were highly regarded in EB society.
Equid figurines, many of which are depicted carrying a pair of containers on their
backs along with a few that are depicted with saddles or harnesses from EB II­III
contexts, have been found over a wide swath of the southern Levant, from Tel Dan
in the north to Arad in the south, and from Azor in the west to Khirbet ez-Zeraqon
in the east (comprehensively reviewed in Milevski, 2011: 184­188). Of the laden
donkey figurines from primary contexts, all but one are from burials. These fig-
urative representations of donkeys and their burdens lend support to the premise
that people, donkeys and the goods they transported became co-dependent elem-
ents in a unified field of practice.
The new agricultural practices that accompanied the SPR would have created
dramatic changes of the landscape and how people moved about this space.
Agricultural fixtures, such as check dams, traction and pack animals, and fruit
orchards were new to Chalcolithic and EB Age landscapes. These new features
of the landscape would have also created a shift in temporality, as ploughing,
planting, harvesting and processing tasks supplanted annual scheduling of smaller
scale agricultural practices. Taken together, the intimate relationships formed with
livestock as a consequence of the new SPR temporalities would have spelled
important changes in agricultural practices in terms of labour saving, higher
yields, storable surpluses and valuations of agricultural staples (Philip, 2003: 108).
Discussion
The Chalcolithic­EB Age of the southern Levant is interpreted as a cultural entity
that enacted human­animal co-dependence through the establishment of pro-
tracted and systematic secondary products exploitation practices. While livestock
domestication brought humans and animals into overlapping spaces, it was the
advent of intensive secondary products exploitation that instigated a shift in annual
scheduling of agropastoral activities and, in turn, fostered new temporalities based
on long-term milking, shearing, ploughing and transport regimes with individual
animals. Ultimately, enduring interpersonal relationships formed between second-
ary products-yielding livestock and their human keepers. It is the lived experience
of these relationships, from human and non-human animal perspectives, to which
the discussion now turns.
Animal perceptions of humans
Ethological research is currently overturning the idea that humans are the only
animal species capable of complex social learning. Simple forms of social learning
have been observed in many mammal, bird, fish and invertebrate species
104 Journal of Social Archaeology 15(1)
(Whiten and Van Schaik, 2007). More complex forms of social learning have been
found in chimpanzees, elephants and dolphins, among other species. Proponents of
animal consciousness argue that non-human animals are active, sentient, wilful
subjects that are as much engaged with each other as people are with each other
(Cartmill, 2000; Griffin, 1976, 2001). This emerging field of research has repeatedly
demonstrated that several non-human animal species enact complex cognitive abil-
ities during competitive foraging events. For example, some animals have know-
ledge of what other competitors can and cannot see and they use this knowledge to
gain success in foraging. Such behaviours have mostly been observed in non-
human primates, but critically for the present discussion, these abilities have
been observed in domestic goats. Results from experiments found that goats
make complex foraging choices that depend on factors such as position in the
dominance hierarchy relative to conspecifics and the visual gaze of a competitor
(Kaminski et al., 2006). Goats have also been found to follow the directional gaze
cues from other species (in this case, humans) in order to find hidden food
(Kaminski et al., 2005). These and other empirical results from animal behaviour
research form a compelling case for extending attributions of self-awareness,
agency and consciousness to certain non-human animals that include livestock
species (Griffin, 2001; Whiten, 2013). This emerging evidence from ethology
should compel zooarchaeologists to redress outmoded ideas of human exception-
alism by taking seriously the possibility of non-human animal social intelligence
and human­animal co-sociality (Waldau, 2013).
Before scientists found empirical support for a theory of animal consciousness,
non-Western indigenous people widely regarded animals as active agents, as they
do to this day. These indigenous ontologies almost certainly long predate the
Cartesian dualism of person/animal. These perspectives raise the question: If
humans and non-humans alike are conscious beings, then what, if anything, dis-
tinguishes us from them? The anthropological answer to this question lies in the
enigmatic realm of culture (Laland and Hoppitt, 2003). However, the more tan-
gible answer is the uniquely human capacity for intellectual reason. A goat engaged
in the purposive act of browsing may have intuitive thoughts and feelings with
respect to food and the social interactions with the herder and other goats in the
herd (Kaminski et al., 2005, 2006). However, this goat and all other non-primate
animals do not possess a priori knowledge necessary for deductive reasoning
(Davidson, 1982), but nonetheless make complex decisions (Wynne, 2004).
Human perceptions of animals
While the issue of non-human animal consciousness inspires fierce debate among
biologists and, more recently, anthropologists, a rather more contentious assertion,
and one with fewer adherents, is that non-human animals exist in an intersubjective
world of meaningful social relations. Ingold draws a categorical distinction
between the hunter­wild animal interaction, which is conceived as a relationship
based on trust, and the herder­livestock interaction, which he conceives as a
Allentuck 105
relationship based on domination (Ingold, 1994). The pastoralist acts as a provider,
guardian and executioner and in this sense holds a mastery over the dependent
herd. Ingold interprets the pastoralist's material culture, such as the whip, spur,
tether and harness, as tools used to restrict or stimulate movement through super-
ior force. In effect, the relationship between humans and livestock, particularly
those that are subjugated in work, is rendered as one between master and slave.
Tapper (1988) also explores the theme of animal slavery. He identifies parallels
between slavery and draught animals in terms of the human control of the feeding
and reproduction of subservient animals. Tapper also finds similarities between
pastoralists who lead their herd across pastures and feudal lords who provide
protection in exchange for payment. A similar perspective draws an analogy
between the pastoralist and the slave master (Tani, 1996). This analogy is sup-
ported by the example of the bellwether, a castrated sheep or goat employed to
lead the flock. Castration serves to make otherwise aggressive animals obedient,
but it effectively removes the animal from the reproductive portion of the herd,
thus creating an outcast that is neither a member of the herd nor one of the herders.
Rather, the bellwether serves the liminal role of mediator between the herder and
the flock. Since most of a dairy herd is composed of female animals, the wether is
regarded as a guardian of the females, which makes it functionally analogous to the
human eunuch. This characterisation may be extended to castrated draught ani-
mals (Clutton-Brock, 1994: 31­32). Castration not only reduces aggression but also
induces weight gain, which is a helpful attribute for animals engaged in hauling and
ploughing. The consensus among these scholars is that coercive dominance char-
acterises the relationship between people and their livestock.
Ingold's (1994) distinction of trust held between hunters and wild animals and
domination held between herders and domestic animals has been critiqued on a
number of grounds. Armstrong Oma (2010) regards Ingold's thesis as untenable for
characterising people who share a common mode of exploiting animals a common
ontology with respect to animals. She even objects to the term human­animal
interaction. Instead, she makes the case for human­animal intra-action, a term
that connotes mutuality and co-constitution of being. Her argument for intra-
action is particularly satisfying in a discussion of the social contract between
dairy stock and their managers. Although the two parties are not equal, their
relationship must be founded on trust rather than coercion in order for the animals
to be sufficiently calm to let down their milk. Armstrong Oma, while challenging
Ingold's aphorism of the virtuous hunter and the oppressive herder, perpetuates a
different metanarrative: the Euro­American presumption of the existence of a
duality between trust and domination in indigenous ontology.
Pa
´ lsson (1996) presents a more forceful critique against the trust­domination
dualism, although not against Ingold's (1994) thesis in particular. Pa
´ lsson argues
that to separate orientalism and paternalism (approximately equivalent to domin-
ation and trust, respectively) perpetuates the modernist duality of society and
nature. Rather, Pa
´ lsson offers a third paradigm, environmental communalism,
which rejects the nature/society separation. This concept promotes a dialogue
106 Journal of Social Archaeology 15(1)
among people and environment, two spheres that constitute a unified totality.
Pa
´ lsson's proposal to consider society and nature together as a total concept par-
allels Bateson's (1972) `ecology of mind' model that views mind and nature as
an indivisible whole, and Latour's (1993) theory of hybrids that blends society/
nature and human/non-human. The environmental communalism paradigm, more-
over, challenges assumptions of economic exploitation, indigenous protection and
the objectification of animals, which are the hallmarks of orientalism and
paternalism.
The gnomic utterances used to describe the nature of human­animal relations,
which have constituted the prevailing discourse, now appear outmoded. Notions
of unity-in-opposition and environmental communalism present a welcome
challenge to the dualistic aphorisms of trust/domination and human-as-master/
animal-as-slave. Indeed, moral ambivalence and ontological fluidity with
respect to domesticated animals find empirical support in the archaeological
record. The now pervasive `animal turn' in social science scholarship dissolves
the human­animal boundary (e.g. Knight, 2005; Waldau, 2013). Under the guise
of human­animal relations studies, which has only recently gained traction in
archaeological research, humans and animals are in a continuous state of mutual
becoming and are therefore co-constituted. Postulations of fluid interspecies
boundaries and hybrid sociality are responses to long-standing anthropocentric
conceptualisations of Homo sapiens as a species exclusive of all others
(Overton and Hamilakis, 2013).
In keeping with these alternate perspectives on shifting human­animal relations
is the work of Orton (2010), who argues that initial animal domestication in the
European Neolithic triggered an ontological shift from animals as commodities to
animals as `sentient property'. He proposes this neologism as a purposefully
contradictory term to capture the dual nature of domestic animals as possessions
and social subjects. With respect to the Neolithic of southern Britain, where cattle
remains are commonly found in association with human remains in mortuary
contexts, Ray and Thomas (2003: 40) contend that the partnership formed between
people and cattle was intimate to the point of ontological equivalency. The con-
clusions drawn from these examples point to a transformation in human­livestock
relations as a consequence of the domestication process bringing livestock into the
fold of human society.
Notions of endurance and closeness form the central argument in an essay that
at once argues against the premise of interpersonal relations between the hunter
and his prey and for the possibility of intimate, interpersonal relationships between
humans and domesticated animals (Knight, 2012). Knight makes the pragmatic, if
not utilitarian, evaluation that hunting, as an act of stalking and killing prey that
occurs in the course of a brief one-off encounter, is an implausible circumstance
during which members of two species can become sufficiently familiar with one
another such that their relation might be considered intimate. Instead, Knight
maintains that domesticated animals are far better candidates to enter into intimate
relationships with humans. He cites their tameness and captivity as qualities that
Allentuck 107
create a spatiotemporal context of frequent and close interactions (Knight, 2012:
343). Individual humans and animals build histories of repeated encounters, the
cumulative effect of which is a depth of familiarity. While Knight's detractors find
his thesis instrumentalist in tone and reductionist in approach [see comments in
Knight (2012)], he nevertheless makes a compelling argument against the hunting-
as-trust (Ingold, 1994) and cosmic economy of sharing (Bird-David, 1992) models
on the basis of the temporal durability of human­animal relations.
A particularly clear example of enduring human­livestock relations, but one
that does not shy away from interspecific complexity and ambiguity, is found in
the oppositional ontologies held by commercial and hobbyist livestock breeders
and slaughterers in modern northeastern Scotland (Wilkie, 2005). Workers in com-
mercial livestock production, particularly those responsible for slaughter, regard
animals as deindividualised commodities, whereas those working in the hobbyist
sector, particularly those who are responsible for breeding, decommodify livestock
by recognising each animal as an individual. In the interstices between commercial
slaughterers and hobbyist breeders are commercial breeders and hobbyist slaugh-
terers who report ambiguous or ambivalent feelings about their animals. Wilkie
found that the closer workers are to the breeding side of the process, the easier it is
for them to acknowledge their emotional affect for their animals. Breeders, who
spend long periods of time intimately nurturing animals from insemination to
weaning, associate their work with the production of life rather than death.
These workers express an intersubjective affinity for individual animals.
Slaughterers, on the other hand, have brief, indirect encounters with livestock in
the moments before their deaths. These workers do not form emotional bonds to
individual animals, but instead treat animals categorically as a herd or simply as
meat, perhaps as an effort to mollify the burden of the executioner.
Wilkie's case of divergent ontological positions among Scottish livestock
producers provides two important insights to consider when thinking about
human­livestock relations in the past. First, the ontological position of domesti-
cated animals is likely variable within a single culture, a point that should dissuade
anyone from making monolithic statements about the nature of such relations.
Second, the longevity and directness of interaction between an individual human
and an individual animal is the critical factor that establishes the degree to which
individual members from two species can become socially connected.
An ethnographic case that echoes the interspecific complexity found by Wilkie
concerns farmers in a Greek island community who hold multiple ontologies with
respect to their animals. Theodossopoulos (2005) describes the farmer's relation-
ship with his livestock as one based on both resource exploitation and kinship.
Greek farmers initially regard individual livestock animals as useful instruments of
food and labour, but over time this relationship becomes more intimate as the
animal becomes a member of the household. Livestock are brought into the
moral sphere of the household because their keepers feel a sense of duty to animals
that diligently provide their secondary products and eventually, their primary
products. Farmers are compelled through a moral obligation of reciprocity to
108 Journal of Social Archaeology 15(1)
return the favour by providing care and protection to their livestock. Over the two-
to three-year period of rearing and training, a draught animal is cared for by its
owner or guardian in a controlling, domineering fashion, just as a child is treated
(Theodossopoulos, 2005: 22). But over the longer period during which that animal
works, its owner or guardian develops an affective, nurturing attitude that reflects a
sense of kinship, just like a member of the family. The ontological shift that
develops over the prolonged period of collaboration between animal and person
does not entail the replacement of a domination ethos with a trust ethos. Rather,
the prior exploitative attitude is mediated by affective care for an animal that is
regarded as a member of the household. These Greek farmers, who form enduring
and close relationships with their livestock, ambiguously regard livestock as instru-
mental and affective.
A final example of the complexity and ambiguity found in human­livestock
relations is offered by a Mesopotamian cuneiform text from Nippur dating to
the early second millennium BC (Old Babylonian period). This tablet, which
describes inheritance of property, lists cattle along with other household property
such as a wagon, grindstone and door (Postgate, 1992: 97). However, the same text
describes cattle with personified names much like a member of the family (Postgate,
1992: 164). These dual connotations of property and persona suggest that
Babylonians regarded cattle as both resources and kin.
In this section, I have attempted to reconcile animal domestication and SPR
frameworks with perspectives from human­animal studies emphasising temporal-
ity as the critical factor leading to intimate co-sociality. The southern Levantine
evidence, which shows that people, livestock and agricultural technology and prac-
tice became spatially and temporally imbricated in the period that spans the
Chalcolithic to EB, supports the premise of a permeable human­animal boundary
approaching ontological intersubjectivity for secondary products-yielding livestock
and the humans that cared for them.
Conclusion
The theory advanced in this paper offers a grounded alternative to the transhis-
torical theories of human­animal relations that have dominated archaeological
discussion. Initial ungulate domestication in the Neolithic was novel both in
terms of its mode of exploitation and the nature of human­animal relations that
developed in its course. However, the potential for intimate human­livestock rela-
tions was only made possible when the lives of animals were extended with the
advent of secondary products exploitation. While the energetic benefits of milk and
traction would not have been lost on people in the past, secondary products trans-
formed several other facets of society. Over the course of the long-term process of
becoming domesticated and continuing through the development of intensive sec-
ondary products exploitation, people and their livestock developed varying degrees
of intimate social relationships.
Allentuck 109
This theory holds temporality as the critical element that defines human­live-
stock relations. Just as Knight (2012) argues that the brief encounter between
hunter and prey does not provide an opportunity for members of two species to
get acquainted, I have argued that animal domestication in and of itself is not a
sufficient explanation for the spatiotemporal context of human­livestock relations
of the Chalcolithic and EB of the southern Levant. Rather, I contend that intensive
secondary products exploitation merits recognition for fostering the ever closer and
frequent contact between humans and livestock that was required for routine
extraction of milk, fibre, traction and transport. Exploitation of secondary prod-
ucts shifted focus away from primarily slaughtering young animals for meat and
towards long-term maintenance of livestock. The longevity of lives of animals that
provide secondary products afforded the opportunity for individual members of
two species to achieve mutual familiarity and thereby enter into social relation-
ships. The emergence of intensive secondary products exploitation redefined
domestic animals to the extent that livestock and people formed a relational web
of dependency (Hodder, 2011). This new set of practices created a human depend-
ency on healthy cows, ewes and does for regular and frequent milk production, and
healthy oxen and donkeys for labour, while livestock in turn depended upon people
for nothing less than their existence.
The model of human­livestock relations for the southern Levantine
Chalcolithic­EB Age that is presented in this paper considers domestic animals
to have been ontologically entangled within a world of agricultural practices that
included material and immaterial constituents. Material constituents included live-
stock, humans, agricultural fields, cereal and orchard crops, fodder, water, meat,
milk, fibres and labour, while immaterial constituents included perceptions of
wealth, power, trust and domination, work and kinship. Although the lens of
Western thought would place some of these elements at odds with one another
(e.g. human/animal, pastoralism/agriculture, trust/domination and power/kinship),
a relational ontology of human­livestock interactions reflected in the social and
economic conditions described for the Chalcolithic­EB Age of the southern Levant
does not find opposition between competing interests, but rather conceives of these
concepts as ambiguously held in tension. This world of contradictions, quite apart
from our own, is conceived as a coherent reality.
