Demographic, Intrinsic, and Extrinsic Factors
Associated With Weapon Carrying at School
Cheryl M. Kodjo, MD, MPH; Peggy Auinger, MS; Sheryl A. Ryan, MD
Background: Recent incidents of school violence have
heightened the need to identify societal, interpersonal,
and adolescent characteristics that contribute to weapon
carrying.
Objectives: To assess the prevalence of weapon carry-
ing at school and to determine associated risk factors for
adolescent males and females.
Design: A cross-sectional study using the 1994-1995 Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data.
Participants: A nationally representative sample of 6504
adolescents and their parents.
Main Outcome Measure: Whether adolescents have
ever carried a weapon at school.
Statistics: 2 Analyses and hierarchical regressions
were done using SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) and
SUDAAN (Research Triangle Park, NC) software.
Regression models included demographic, intrinsic,
and extrinsic factors.
Results: Of the overall sample, 9.3% (n=595) reported
having carried a weapon at school. Of these, 77% were
male (male vs female adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.1; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 2.3-4.1). Substance use, school
problems, perpetration of violence, and witnessing vio-
lence were significantly associated with weapon carry-
ing for both males and females. However, for males, ex-
trinsic factors were more important in mediating the
effects of substance use and perpetration of physical vio-
lence on school weapon carrying, while intrinsic factors
mediate these variables for females.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that interventions
for violence prevention for males and females need to be
targeted toward different areas.

ACCORDING TO the 1995
Youth Risk Behavior Sur-
vey, 10% of high school
students reported carry-
ing a weapon to school in
the previous 30 days.1 Although the rates
of reported fighting and weapon carrying
are decreasing, the prevalence of expo-
sure to violence at school is high.2 Since
1997, there have been 15 highly publi-
cized school shootings, the majority of
which have been in high schools and were
committed by students who carried guns
to school.
Weapon carrying can result in vio-
lence.3,4 Weapon carrying has most typi-
cally been defined in surveys as carrying
a gun, knife, or club.2,5-7 Violence, in turn,
has been defined as a threatened or ac-
tual use of physical force against a person
or group that either results in or is likely
to result in injury or death.8 Students who
carry a weapon at school may choose not
to use it, but weapon carrying increases
the potential for physical injury or death.
For this reason, recent school shootings
have heightened the need to identify de-
mographic, intrinsic, and extrinsic risk fac-
tors associated with weapon carrying at
school. Although protective factors are im-
portant to consider, risk factors are im-
portant to assess for early identification of
those adolescents who are likely to carry
a weapon at school. The biopsychosocial
model proposed by Irwin et al9 is used to
explain many problem behaviors in ado-
lescents. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
such as those listed previously, are hy-
pothesized to predict risk behaviors such
as weapon carrying, through their effect
on cognition, self-perceptions, percep-
tions of the social environment, and per-
sonal values. By examining both sets of fac-
tors, we can assess adolescents' weapon
carrying from a more contextual view. Ex-
trinsic factors can reduce the effects of in-
trinsic risk factors and vice versa. Extrin-
sic and intrinsic factors can also interact

so that their protection or risk can be cumulative. For
example, we hypothesize that an impulsive adolescent
who has good interpersonal relationships would be pro-
tected from high-risk behaviors. Similarly, we hypoth-
esize that an aggressive adolescent who has easy access
to weapons and who is exposed to routine community
violence would be at high risk for carrying a weapon at
school.
Previous literature regarding school weapon carry-
inghasfocusedontheassociationsbetweenadolescentrisk
behaviors and violence.5,6,10-14 However, these studies do
not examine the combined effects of demographic, intrin-
sic, and extrinsic factors on weapon-carrying behaviors.
For the purposes of this study, we defined intrinsic
factors as internal qualities that affect decision making,
and extrinsic factors as experiences that adolescents have
with the people at home, in their schools, and in their
communities.
Our category of intrinsic factors included impulsiv-
ity, mental health, and sense of the future. Adolescents
who are depressed or who do not have a sense of the fu-
ture are more likely to engage in risk behaviors like
weapon carrying.15 We include substance use and per-
petration of physical violence as intrinsic factors be-
cause of their strong correlation to weapon carrying as
seen in previously published literature.7,10,14,16-18 Our cat-
egory of extrinsic factors included connectedness, expo-
sures to violence in one's community, and safety and vic-
timization. These factors have all been found to have
significant correlations with weapon carrying or high-
risk behaviors in general.13,19-23,15,12,16
This cross-sectional study is one of the first5,6,11 to
examine these diverse variables and their association with
weapon carrying at school using a large, nationally rep-
resentative database. The National Longitudinal Study for
Adolescent Health (Add Health) includes items that ad-
dress extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The objectives of this
study were to assess the prevalence of weapon carrying
at school, and to determine those risk factors associated
with carrying a weapon at school for adolescent males
and females.
METHODS
SAMPLE
Add Health assesses the health of adolescents and explores the
causes of their health-related behaviors. It is a school-based,
nationally representative survey of 7th to 12th graders aged 11
to 21 years in the United States. A sample of 80 high schools
was selected and stratified by region of the country, urbanicity,
school type, ethnic mix, and size. Schools that sent their
7th- and 8th-grade graduates on to that high school (feeder
schools) were identified and recruited. Some high schools
spanned 7th to 12th grade and therefore, served as their own
feeder school. A total of 134 schools were recruited. More than
90000 adolescents were surveyed in targeted schools, and a
sample of 12105 adolescents and their parents were then sur-
veyed at home.
There were 3 survey instruments, 1 in-school and 2 in-
home, that gathered information from the adolescents and their
parents. There were several other instruments regarding con-
textual variables, school information, and interviewer assess-
ments. Additional detail regarding the Add Health sampling
design is available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects
/addhealth/. Variables from the adolescent in-home, parent
in-home, and the neighborhood or community context instru-
ments were used for the adolescent, socioeconomic, and con-
textual data in this study.
STUDY POPULATION
The Wave 1 (1994-1995), public-use, in-home database pro-
vided cross-sectional data on 6504 adolescents. The mean age
of study participants was 15.5 years, and 49% were female. Sixty-
seven percent of participants were white, 16% were African
American, 12% were Latino, and 5% were "other," including
Asians, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders.
VARIABLES
The dependent outcome variable of interest was "Have you ever
carried a weapon at school?" The response categories were yes
or no. A preceding question defined a weapon as "a gun, knife,
or club." Independent demographic factors included: age, gen-
der, race, ethnicity, parental level of education, urbanicity (de-
fined in the census data as a central place with an adjacent,
densely settled surrounding territory, together having a mini-
mum of 50000 persons), and neighborhood poverty status.
Other independent factors included perceived longevity, school
suspension, safety in the community, witnessing violence, in-
volvement in domestic, dating or sexual violence, substance use
at school, and access to a gun at home.
In addition to the above independent variables, scales were
created to address other risk factors. For example, the perpe-
tration scale was composed of questions regarding frequency
of physical fighting, gang fighting activity, and threatening
someone with a weapon. Six scales were created, containing
3 to 7 items. The scales were (1) interpersonal connectedness,
(2) perpetration of physical violence, (3) mental health is-
sues, (4) school connectedness, (5) violent victimization, and
(6) impulsivity. Specific variables included in each scale are pre-
sented in Table 1.
Many of the items included in the scales were 3-point or
5-point Likert responses.24 All items were assessed for consis-
tency of low score meaning low-risk, and high score meaning
high-risk. The responses of those items in each scale were then
added to create a score for each adolescent. Adolescents who
missed more than 1 question in the scale were not included in
the analyses. The frequency distribution for each scale was
determined, and low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk clinical
categories were created for each scale based on the tercile dis-
tribution of the scores.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Data were analyzed using principal component analyses to dis-
tinguish individual variables for school and interpersonal con-
nectedness. Cronbach  values used to measure the internal
validity of each scale were as follows: interpersonal connect-
edness, =.72 for 6 items; perpetration of physical violence,
=.72 for 7 items; mental health, =.70 for 6 items; school con-
nectedness, =.65 for 7 items; victimization, =.65 for 5 items;
and impulsivity, =.62 for 5 items.
Weighted frequencies and Pearson 2 testing were done
using SPSS 8.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill), to determine factors
independently associated with weapon carrying at school. Be-
cause there were many significant factors, a Spearman corre-
lational matrix was done to assess multicollinearity. Spear-
man correlation analyses did not demonstrate high enough
coefficients to suggest multicollinearity between these vari-

ables. Significant factors (P.05) were then included for hier-
archical modeling.
Hierarchical regressions using SUDAAN (Research Tri-
angle Park, NC) assessed confounding and effect modification
for demographic variables by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Con-
founding is the mixing of effects or the distortion of the true
relationship between the outcome and independent vari-
able.25 Effect modification is the interaction of variables such that
the association between one variable and the outcome is influ-
enced by the other variables.25 We grouped independent vari-
ables into 3 subsets: demographic factors, intrinsic factors, and
extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors included chance of being killed
by age 21 years, mental health, impulsivity, perpetration of physi-
cal violence, being high or drunk at school, and school sus-
pension. Extrinsic factors included school connectedness, in-
terpersonal connectedness, victimization, partner violence,
sexual assault, witnessing violence, neighbors looking out for
each other, neighborhood safety, and access to a gun.
Hierarchical models first included demographics; then,
combined demographics with intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
separately; and finally, combined all 3 subsets of factors. Hi-
erarchical regressions examined the mediating and interactive
effects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors before being com-
bined into a composite logistic regression. These analyses were
performed for the overall sample, and separately for adoles-
cent males and females. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-
fit test for the model was P=.17 for males and P=.20 for fe-
males, demonstrating that the models should not be rejected.26

RESULTS
PREVALENCE OF WEAPON CARRYING

having carried a weapon at school. Seventy-seven percent
of weapon-carrying adolescents were male (adjusted odds
ratio[AOR]=3.2;malevsfemale,P.05).Adolescentswho
had carried a weapon to school in the last month (n=371)
were asked, "During the past 30 days, what one kind of
weapon did you carry most often to school?" Sixty-seven
percent of these adolescents reported carrying a knife or
razor; 13%, a handgun; 8%, some other kind of weapon;
7%, a club; and 5%, a rifle or shotgun. Males were signifi-
cantly more likely than females to carry a weapon. Eighty-
three percent of handgun carriers, 85% of rifle or shotgun
carriers, 82% of club carriers, 78% of knife or razor carri-
ers, and 66% of other weapon carriers were male.
Neighborhood poverty and parental education less
than or equal to a high school level were significantly as-
sociated with weapon carrying at school. Age was signifi-
cant , with adolescents aged 15 to 17 years being most at
risk for weapon carrying. Urban environment was not sig-
nificant. Table 2 presents cross-tabulation data on preva-
lence of weapon carrying by demographic variables.
INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC FACTORS
THAT MEDIATE THE EFFECTS
OF DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS
Through hierarchical regressions, we examined effect
modification and confounding effects for race and eth-
nicity, neighborhood poverty, and parental education. Be-
cause male gender was the most significant risk factor
for weapon carrying at school in the overall sample, we
also examined gender differences in separate analyses
(Table 3).
Initial analyses included only independently sig-
nificant demographic factors (age, gender, race, ethnic-
ity, parental level of education, urbanicity, and neigh-
borhood poverty status) in the regression model. Male
adolescents with a high schoolÂ­educated parent were 1.6
times as likely to carry a weapon at school than males
whose parent had less than or more than a high school
education. African American and Latino female adoles-
cents were 2.8 and 2.4 times, respectively, as likely as white
females to carry a weapon.
For the second set of hierarchical analyses, high
schoolÂ­level parental education was no longer signifi-
cant for males when intrinsic and extrinsic factors were
separately added into the model. For females, being Af-
rican American or Latino remained significant despite add-
ing intrinsic and extrinsic factors into the model, al-
though the odds ratios associated with being African
American or Latino decreased with each step. African
American and Latino females were 2.6 and 2.4 times, re-
spectively, as likely as white females to carry a weapon
when intrinsic factors were accounted for, and they were
1.9 and 2.2 times as likely when extrinsic factors were
accounted for. These models demonstrated that intrin-
sic and extrinsic factors act as confounders for parental
education for males, and as effect modifiers for race or
ethnicity for females.
EFFECT MODIFICATION
AND CONFOUNDING FACTORS FOR
INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC VARIABLES
The second set of hierarchical analyses--adding intrin-
sic and extrinsic factors separately--demonstrated many
factors that were significantly associated with weapon car-
rying (Table 3). When these factors were combined in
the final model, several factors were no longer signifi-
cant. For example, intrinsic factors such as impulsivity
and perceived longevity were no longer significant for
males once extrinsic factors were added. Likewise, sexual
assault was no longer significant once intrinsic factors
were added. This portion of the model demonstrated that
intrinsic and extrinsic factors can serve as confounders
for each other. There is also effect modification between
these 2 sets of factors as seen by the decreased adjusted
odds ratios for each variable in the final model.

FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH WEAPON
CARRYING AT SCHOOL
All significant independent variables were included in the
final hierarchical regression model. The findings for the
male and female subgroups are compared in Table 4.
Of note, commonly used socioeconomic markers such
as parental education less than college, urban environ-
ment, and neighborhood poverty were not significantly
associated with weapon carrying at school in the final re-
gression analyses. Partner violence (AOR=4.0), perpe-
tration of physical violence (AOR=2.5), witnessing
violence (AOR=2.3), interpersonal connectedness
(AOR=0.5), and school connectedness (AOR=0.4) were
the most significant factors for males. Being under the
influence of substances at school (AOR=5.4 for alco-
hol; AOR=2.3 for drugs), school suspension (AOR=2.5),
being African American (AOR=2.2) or Latino (AOR=2.3),
and perpetration of physical violence (AOR=2.2) were
most significant for females.

regressions were performed to compare white, African
American, and Latino females. The results for the fe-
male subgroups are presented in Table 5. Females who
were classified as "other" race were not included in these
analyses because of the small sample size (n=128). As
presented in Table 5, there were differences between the
groups. Being drunk at school was a more significant risk
factor for African American (AOR=23.6) and Latino fe-
males (AOR=15.0) than for white females (AOR=4.2).
Other independent variables such as victimization, in-
terpersonal connectedness, and neighborhood safety
became significant for white and African American fe-
males in these analyses when they were not significant
in the analyses of all females in the previous hierarchi-
cal regressions.
COMMENT
This study examined the effects of demographic, intrin-
sic, and extrinsic factors on school weapon carrying by
using a large, nationally representative database, Add
Health. The results of the hierarchical regressions ex-
pand our understanding of the interaction of demo-
graphic, intrinsic, and extrinsic factors relative with school
weapon carrying. For example, the hierarchical regres-
sions demonstrate that the effects of parental education
and neighborhood poverty were mediated by intrinsic and
extrinsic factors. The fact that environment was not sig-
nificant in our bivariate analyses speaks to the impor-
tance of other factors such as the ones we propose here,
to explain the problem of school weapon carrying.
Significant factors in the final model were consis-
tent with the previous literature. This study demon-
strated that male gender was one of the most significant
risk factors associated with weapon carrying at school.3,16
These findings countered those of Simon et al,5 who found
females to be more likely to carry a weapon than males.
African American and Latino females in our sample were
at risk for weapon carrying. It is unclear why race or eth-
nicity was significant for females, but not for males. Race
or ethnicity and poverty are difficult to separate because
many African American and Latino families in the United
States live in concentrated poverty.29 Decreased neigh-
borhood cohesion secondary to concentrated poverty may
put African American and Latino females at risk for vic-
timization.30 Indeed, in the specific ethnicity/gender analy-
ses, other factors such as neighborhood safety became
important for African American females. For protec-
tion, these females may choose to carry a weapon to in-
sure safety in their neighborhood, and by extension, at
school. As demonstrated by the other factors that proved
significant in the analyses of factors among females (eg,
being drunk at school), these African American and La-
tino females who carried weapons were particularly high-
risk subgroups.
Those males with a history of partner violence were
at a greater risk factor for school weapon carrying than
those males who did not. Theoretical models often link
aggression and violent behavior and can be used here to
explain the association of partner violence to school
weapon carrying. However, the survey item did not dis-
tinguish between being a perpetrator or a victim with re-
spect to partner violence. Partner violence, in compari-
son to perpetration of physical violence, seems to indicate
a more severe form of interpersonal violence that strongly
correlates with weapon carrying.
An association exists between substance use and
weapon carrying.6,16 The use of substances at school might
indicate that this was a subgroup of males and females
who were not feeling connected or engaged in school.
Their substance use at school may also have conse-
quences for decision-making, as adolescents under the
influence are less likely to consider the consequences of
weapon carrying.
School connectedness and interpersonal connect-
edness were significantly protective against school weapon
carrying for all males and for African American females.
Consistent with the resiliency model,17 the more assets
adolescents have, the more likely that they will make posi-
tive choices. Good relationships with parents, teachers,
other adults, and peers are important assets that contrib-
ute positively to an adolescent's behavior. Adolescent fe-
males, on the other hand, were 2.5 times more likely to
carry a weapon at school if they had been suspended.
School suspension may suggest behavioral issues and
academic failure rather than lack of connectedness.
School suspension again emphasizes that these weapon-
carrying females were a high-risk subgroup.
Perpetration of physical violence and witnessing vio-
lence was significant in both gender analyses. Victimiza-
tion, on the other hand, was significant for males and white
females. Adolescents who have been victimized may feel

vulnerable and choose to protect themselves with a
weapon. Interestingly, victimization was significant only
for white females. Adolescent females are more at risk
for sexual assault than males,31 yet victimization does not
seem to be a motivator to carry a weapon at school for
some females.
Surprisingly, access to a gun at home was mini-
mally significant for males. In this same adolescent sample,
it was found that the majority of weapon-carrying ado-
lescents carried a knife or razor at school, which would
explain why easy access to a gun was not more signifi-
cant in our analyses. However, the fact that access to fire-
arms has increased the lethality of violence32 makes it a
particularly important issue to retain in discussions re-
garding potential school violence.
These findings suggest that interventions for vio-
lence prevention for males and females need to be tar-
geted toward different areas. Males may benefit from ex-
trinsic supports such as interpersonal and school
connectedness, and lack of access to a gun, despite being
impulsive or having decreased perceived longevity. Fe-
males may benefit from interventions that improve prob-
lem-solving skills.
LIMITATIONS
There are, however, limitations. Our analysis uses one
wave of data, and therefore, could not assess causality.
Only longitudinal data will allow us to understand if an-
tecedent factors like school and interpersonal connect-
edness predict protection against future school weapon
carrying. Longitudinal studies are also needed to assess
adolescents' sense of security in light of recent national
school shootings and their subsequent decisions to carry
a weapon or not. Add Health is a school-based survey.
We do not have access to the those adolescents who have
been expelled or who have dropped out of school, as
school failure is highly correlated with violence and other
high-risk behaviors.33 This study relied on adolescent self-
report as the "gold standard," with no means to corrobo-
rate weapon carrying at school. This item about weapon
carrying posed a threat to validity because it is a sensi-
tive question regarding illegal behavior. Thus, we may
be underestimating the prevalence of school weapon car-
rying. Also, Add Health did not include specific items
about chronic (and potentially more desensitizing) do-
mestic or community violence exposure. There were also
no items regarding other contexts for weapon carrying,
adolescent attitudes about weapon carrying, or the vio-
lent content of television and video games to which the
adolescents were exposed.
IMPLICATIONS
Violence prevention programming must be community
based to encompass adolescents who carry weapons at
and outside of school. For school weapon carrying spe-
cifically, intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as sub-
stance use, coping skills, school behavioral problems, and
connectedness must be addressed. Additionally, vio-
lence interventions need to be tailored to gender, racial,
and ethnic differences in risk.

What This Study Adds
Recent school shootings have heightened the need to iden-
tify demographic, intrinsic, and extrinsic factors associ-
ated with weapon carrying at school. Previous litera-
ture regarding school weapon carrying has focused on
individual correlates of violent behavior. This study ex-
amined the combined effects of demographic, intrinsic,
and extrinsic factors by using a large, nationally repre-
sentative database, the National Longitudinal Study for
Adolescent Health. Substance use, perpetration of physi-
cal violence, and witnessing violence were significant cor-
relates overall. However, for males, extrinsic factors were
found to be more important in mediating the effects of
substance use and perpetration on school weapon car-
rying, while intrinsic factors mediate these variables for
females. These findings suggest that interventions for vio-
lence prevention for males and females need to be tar-
geted toward different areas.
