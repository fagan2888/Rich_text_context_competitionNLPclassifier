Independent Practice Associations
And Physician-Hospital
Organizations Can Improve Care
Management For Smaller Practices
ABSTRACT Pay-for-performance, public reporting, and accountable care
organization programs place pressures on physicians to use health
information technology and organized care management processes to
improve the care they provide. But physician practices that are not large
may lack the resources and size to implement such processes. We used
data from a unique national survey of 1,164 practices with fewer than
twenty physicians to provide the first information available on the extent
to which independent practice associations (IPAs) and physician-hospital
organizations (PHOs) might make it possible for these smaller practices
to share resources to improve care. Nearly a quarter of the practices
participated in an IPA or a PHO that accounted for a significant
proportion of their patients. On average, practices participating in these
organizations provided nearly three times as many care management
processes for patients with chronic conditions as nonparticipating
practices did (10.4 versus 3.8). Half of these processes were provided only
by IPAs or PHOs. These organizations may provide a way for small and
medium-size practices to systematically improve care and participate in
accountable care organizations.
Many US physicians work in
small practices. In 2008 one-
third were in solo or two-
physician practices, and an-
other 15 percent worked in
practices with three to five physicians.1 Many
other physicians worked in medium-size practic-
es--those with fewer than twenty physicians.2
At their best, small and medium-size practices
can provide personalized care to patients in an
environment in which patients, staff, and physi-
cians know each other well. However, for de-
cades physicians have been gradually migrating
to larger practices.3,4 This movement appears to
be accelerating,5 especially in the case of physi-
cians who become employees of hospitals. But
the persistence of large numbers of indepen-
dent, physician-owned small and medium-size
practices suggests that many physicians and
patients prefer this setting, that it is difficult
to create large practices, or both.6
However, small and medium-size practices are
facing increasing pressure to improve the quality
and value of the care they provide. This pressure
includes incentives to adopt and make effective
use of electronic health records and to perform
well in the rapidly expanding public reporting
and value-based purchasing programs imple-
mented by Medicare and health insurers. In ad-
dition, programs that encourage the formation
of accountable care organizations--organiza-
tions of providers that agree to take responsibil-
ity for the cost and quality of care received by
their population of patients--are beginning to

diffuse through Medicare and private insurers.
Many of the existing accountable care organiza-
tions have been formed by very large medical
groups or by hospitals.7 Is there a place for small
and medium-size practices in a world where
health information technology, pay-for-perfor-
mance and public reporting, and accountable
care organizations hold central positions?
Many small and medium-size practices lack
the financial and human capital to purchase and
make effective use of electronic health record
systems or to develop systematic care manage-
ment processes to improve the quality of care
they provide.8 These practices also lack the scale
to perform some of the activities required of an
accountable care organization, such as employ-
ing nurse care managers to assist patients who
have severe chronic conditions. Smaller practic-
es are unlikely to have enough of these patients
to keep a nurse care manager busy.
Large medical groups have the resources to
create care management processes to improve
the care of their populations of patients. How-
ever, not many communities have such groups.
Hospitals also have enough resources and are
increasingly employing physicians, but some
physicians resist working for a hospital.5 It is
not yet known whether most hospitals can suc-
ceed at creating and operating medical groups.
An alternative for physicians who wish to re-
main in a small or medium-size independent
practice might be to share care management
and information technology resources9 with
other practices through an independent practice
association (IPA) or physician-hospital organi-
zation (PHO).10,11 An IPA is a network of physi-
cians who agree to participate in an association
to contract with health insurance plans. Physi-
cians maintain ownership of their practices and
administer their own offices; the IPA serves as an
organizational structure for negotiating health
plan contracts and for creating processes to im-
prove quality and control health care costs.12
PHOs allow physicians in independent practices
to join with one or more hospitals to create a
network intended to serve the same functions
as an IPA.13,14 A typical IPA or PHO includes 150­
300 physicians, but such organizations may be
much smaller or larger.8
The Affordable Care Act specifies that IPAs and
PHOs can qualify as accountable care organiza-
tions. Health insurers are also including IPAs
and PHOs in their accountable care organization
contracts; an example is Blue Cross Blue Shield
of Massachusetts, with its Alternative Quality
Contract.15 IPAs and PHOs that negotiate con-
tracts with health insurers on behalf of their
physician members are subject to antitrust regu-
lation.16 It is a violation of the antitrust laws for
independent practices to join together to nego-
tiate contracts with health insurers. However,
the Federal Trade Commission and the Depart-
ment of Justice--the federal agencies that can
bring lawsuits to enforce antitrust regulations--
permit IPAs and PHOs to negotiate with insurers
when the practices in the larger organizations
are "clinically integrated."17 The provision of care
management practices by the IPA or PHO is one
of the key criteria for such clinical integration.16
Despite their potential importance, very little
is knownabout IPAs and PHOs. Thereareno data
available on thenumber of active IPAs and PHOs,
and very few studies have focused on these types
of organization.10,12,13
Using data from a large, unique national sur-
vey of small and medium-size physician practic-
es, we present in this article the first available
information on these types of provider groups.
We sought to answer the following questions:
First, what proportion of independent small and
medium-size practices participate in an IPA or
PHO? Second, among practices that do partici-
pate in such an organization, to what extent does
that organization provide care management
processes for patients with one or more of the
four following chronic conditions: asthma, con-
gestive heart failure, depression, and diabetes?
Third, when an IPA or PHO provides care man-
agement processes to a participating practice, to
what extent do those processes duplicate ones
that the practice is already providing? Fourth,
which types of practices receive the most help
with care management processes from IPAs or
PHOs? Fifth, which types of care management
processes do IPAs and PHOs provide most
frequently?
Study Data And Methods
Study Population The data come from the
National Study of Small and Medium-Sized
Physician Practices.18 Between July 2007 and
March 2009 we conducted forty-minute tele-
phone surveys with the physician leader or ad-
ministrator of a national sample of practices that
had one to nineteen physicians. The sample was
drawn from a population constructed using the
IMS Health Healthcare Organizational Services
database. Practices were eligible to participate in
the survey if at least 60 percent of their physi-
cians were adult primary care providers, cardiol-
ogists, endocrinologists, or pulmonologists.
These specialties were selected because their
practitioners routinely provide care for patients
with one or more of the four chronic conditions
listed above. The number of responding practic-
es was 1,745. The adjusted response rate was
63.2 percent, using method 3 of the American

Association for Public Opinion Research for cal-
culating response rates.19
We excluded 409 practices whose physician
workforce was not at least 33 percent primary
care physicians, because our study focused on
practices that could be held responsible for using
care management processes for all four of the
chronic diseases on which the survey focused. Of
the remaining 1,336 practices, 172 (12.9 percent)
were owned by a hospital, health system, or
health maintenance organization. We excluded
these from our analyses because they were not
independent practices and could use their own-
er's resources to provide care management proc-
esses. Our analyses were performed on the re-
maining 1,164 practices.
Survey Instrument The survey instrument
included questions on practice size, specialty
mix, ownership, patient mix, internal payment
methods, involvement in pay-for-performance
or public reporting programs, and acceptance
of financial risk for the cost of patients' care. It
also included questions on the practice's use of
clinical information technology and care man-
agement processes, such as disease registries
and patient reminders for people who had one
or more of the four chronic conditions on which
the survey focused.
The survey also asked respondents whether
their practice received "a significant proportion
of patients through an IPA or an integrated de-
livery system or a...PHO." Practices that re-
sponded "yes" were considered to be participat-
ing in an IPA or PHO. Practices that are part of an
integrated delivery system are owned by the sys-
tem and thus were not included in our analyses.
Use Of Care Management Processes For
each of the four chronic conditions, the survey
asked about the practice's use of the following
five care management processes: registries to
track patients with these conditions, nurse care
managers to provide ongoing care for patients
between office visits, guideline-based reminders
provided at the point of care for physicians about
services their patients should receive, patient
reminders sent by the practice to patients with
chronic diseases about needed preventive or
follow-up care, and reporting of quality data to
the practice's physicians. For each process for
each condition, the survey asked whether the
practice provided the process and whether an
IPA or PHO provided the process.
We constructed six indices of the care manage-
ment processes provided by the practice, the IPA
or PHO, or both the practice and the IPA or PHO.
The maximum score on any index was 20 (five
care management processes multiplied by four
chronic conditions). The practice care manage-
ment process index assigned one point to a prac-
tice for each care management process that the
practice provided, regardless of whether an IPA
or PHO also provided it. The IPA/PHO index
assigned one point to the practice for each care
management process provided by an IPA or
PHO, regardless of whether the practice also
provided it. The practice-only index assigned
one point to a practice for each process that
the practice provided and an IPA or PHO did
not provide, while the IPA/PHO-only index as-
signed one point to a practice for each process
that an IPA or PHO provided and the practice did
not. The practice and IPA/PHO duplicate care
management process index assigned one point
to a practice for each care management process
that both the practice and an IPA or PHO pro-
vided. Finally, the total care management proc-
ess index assigned one point to a practice for
each care management process that was pro-
vided by either the practice, an IPA or PHO, or
both the practice and the larger organization.
Practice Characteristics Our analyses in-
cluded variables for practice size, ownership,
involvement in pay-for-performance or public
reporting programs, acceptance of financial risk
for the cost of patient care, the percentage of the
practice's revenue that came from Medicaid pa-
tients and uninsured low-income patients, and
the percentage of the practice's patients with
limited English proficiency.
Statistical Analyses We conducted t tests to
compare the characteristics of independent
physician practices that did and did not partici-
pate in IPAs or PHOs. We also compared the
participating and nonparticipating practices'
scores on each of the six care management proc-
ess indices.
We analyzed the relationship between the total
care management process index and participa-
tion in an IPA or PHO, holding practice charac-
teristics constant and using negative binomial
regression, a modeling approach useful for deal-
ing with count data. Below we report the mar-
ginal effects from this analysis--that is, the addi-
tional number of care management processes
provided to patients of practices that received
a significant proportion of patients from an IPA
or PHO.
We then examined the relationship between
practice characteristics and the IPA/PHO-only
care management process index, again using
negative binomial regression. This analysis was
designed to produce an estimate of the extent to
which various types of practices benefited from
participating in an IPA or PHO.
All analyses were weighted to account for the
probability of selection for the reporting practic-
es, adjusted for nonresponse, and controlled for
population distributions. The weighting was in-

tended to make our findings broadly represen-
tative of small and medium-size US practices.
Limitations Our study had a number of lim-
itations. First, although we used a large and ran-
domly selected sample of small and medium-size
US practices, we cannot claim that ours was a
precisely representative sample. There is no
"gold standard" data set that contains the pop-
ulation of US physician practices. Second, our
data were reported by a knowledgeable leader of
each practice; we did not conduct an indepen-
dent audit of the care management processes
provided by any practice, IPA, or PHO.
Third, we based our analyses on whether the
practice leader reported that the practice re-
ceived a "significant proportion" of its patients
from an IPA or PHO, or an integrated delivery
system. Leaders may have differed on how they
defined significant proportion. Nevertheless, re-
sponses to this question should reflect the lead-
er's opinion of whether or not the practice was
participating in an IPA or PHO in a meaning-
ful way.
Fourth, our data were collected before the start
of the Medicare accountable care organization
program. It is possible that IPAs and PHOs in-
volved in this program now provide more care
management processes.
Finally, the care management processes in-
cluded in our study are generally considered to
be important in improving the quality of patient
care.20­22 However, our study does not provide
data on whether these processes are associated
with improved outcomes of care. Few data are
available on the quality of care provided by IPAs
and PHOs, although one study and one review of
the limited literature suggest that large medical
groups may provide better care than IPAs on a
limited set of quality process measures.23­25
Study Results
Nearly a quarter (23.8 percent) of practices
reported participating significantly in an IPA
or PHO (Exhibit 1). Practices that did participate
were significantly more likely than nonpartici-
pating practices to have external incentives to
improve quality in the form of public reporting
(46.1 percent versus 32.3 percent) or pay-for-
performance programs (59.7 percent versus
31.2 percent). Participating and nonparticipat-
ing practices did not differ significantly in terms
of size, percentage of patients with limited
English proficiency, or percentage of revenue
received from Medicaid and uninsured patients.
Practices that participated in an IPA or PHO
provided significantly more care management
processes than did nonparticipating practices
(not counting the processes provided by the
IPA or PHO), although as shown in Exhibit 1

the difference was relatively small (5.0 versus
3.8). On average, IPAs or PHOs provided 7.9 care
management processes to participating practic-
es, and 5.4 of them were performed by the IPA
or PHO only (the remaining 2.5 were performed
by both the practice and the IPA or PHO).
Practices varied considerably in the number of
care management processes that they received
from IPAs or PHOs. Out of twenty possible proc-
esses, 16.6 percent of practices received no proc-
esses at all from an IPA or PHO, 25.6 percent
received two or fewer, and 32.5 percent received
ten or more processes (data not shown).
When the care management processes pro-
vided by IPAs and PHOs were included, partici-
pating practices provided 10.4 processes to their
patients, while nonparticipating practices pro-
vided 3.8 (Exhibit 1). This difference was some-
what diminished in a multivariate analysis:
When other variables were held constant, par-
ticipating practices provided 4.8 more care man-
agement processes, including processes pro-
vided by an IPA or PHO, than nonparticipating
practices did (Exhibit 2).We were unable to iden-
tify any practice characteristics that were signifi-
cantly associated with the practice's receiving
more care management processes performed by
an IPA or PHO (see online Appendix Exhibit 1).26
Exhibit 3 provides detailed data on practices'
provision of care management processes by type
of process and by disease. In general, care man-
agement processes were most likely to be pro-
vided for patients with diabetes and least likely to
be provided for those with depression. IPAs and
PHOs provided more processes than practices
did for almost every type of process and for each
of the four chronic conditions. Practices rarely
provided care management processes that re-
quired extensive resources and economies of
scale (notably, the use of nurse care managers
and the provision of quality data to physicians),
whereas these care management processes were
among those most frequently provided by IPAs
and PHOs.

Discussion
Our findings suggest that most small and
medium-size practices did not participate in an
IPA or PHO in a meaningful way--that is, they
did not receive a significant proportion of pa-
tients from one of the larger organizations.
Nevertheless, nearly one-quarter of the small
and medium-size physician-owned practices in
our national sample did participate. For these
practices, IPAs and PHOs provided enough care
management processes, on average, to double
the number of processes offered to the practices'
patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to report this information, which is consistent
with the hypothesis that IPAs and PHOs can pro-
vide care management processes to practices
that lack the resources and scale to implement
these processes themselves.
The care management processes that IPAs and
PHOs provided were, as expected, those that
required large numbers of patients (the use of
nurse care managers) or needed expensive in-
formation technology capabilities to be efficient
(providing internal performance data to physi-
cians).
Our findings provide some encouragement to
those who hope that IPAs and PHOs can create
the best of both worlds, making it possible for
physicians to share resources while remaining in
their own independent practices. But much re-
mains to be learned. The literature comparing
the performance of large medical groups to that
of IPAs is sparse, and to our knowledge there is
no research comparing the performance of hos-
pital-employed physicians to those in physician-
owned practices of any size.
Conclusion
Our findings may be of interest to physicians in
independent practices, leaders of IPAs and
PHOs, Medicare and health plan executives,
and antitrust regulators. Physicians in indepen-
dent small and medium-size practices who want
to participate in an accountable care organiza-
tion, for example, may have the option--depend-
ing on what is available in their community--of
becomingemployed by a hospital or a largemedi-
cal group. The data presented in this article sug-
gest that IPAs and PHOs may be able to provide
an additional, potentially viable organizational
alternative during an era of major changes in
how health care is delivered and paid for.
Our findings suggest that it is a reasonable
decision for leaders of the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services and commercial
health insurers to sign accountable care organi-
zation contracts with IPAs or PHOs, and reason-
able for physicians and hospital leaders to try to
create high-functioning IPAs and PHOs.
It also appears reasonable for the Federal
Trade Commission to permit independent physi-
cians in some IPAs and PHOs to negotiate jointly
with health insurers, without being deemed in
violation of antitrust law, because some IPAs and
PHOs do provide a large number of care man-
agement processes. At the same time, the Federal
Trade Commission should continue to scrutinize
negotiations between health insurers and physi-
cians in IPAs or PHOs carefully, since our data
suggest that 42 percent of practices that partici-
pate in these larger organizations receive no
or very few care management processes from
them.
