Introduction
To quote a few traditional researchers, Neisser (1967) defined
the concept cognition as a study of how people encode, struc-
ture, store, retrieve, use, or otherwise learn knowledge.
Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) in their human information
processing model have viewed that learning and memory
processes are discontinuous and multi-staged, and any new
information before being stored are manipulated by our
information processing/memory system. Their famous stage
theory model identified three types of memory based on its
processing stages that is, sensory memory, short-term/work-
ing memory, and long-term memory. The "Levels of
Processing" theory developed by Craik and Lockhart (1972)
disagreed with the three-stage serial processing model of
Atkinson and Shiffrin and stated that any information from
the environment is being processed at multiple levels simul-
taneously depending on its characteristics, attention, and
meaningfulness. New information need not have to go
through a specific order of processing nor any prescribed
channel. However, the more deeply the information is being
processed/learned, the more it would be retained in our
memory system (Kearsley, 2001). Similarly, the more con-
nections, elaborations being made to any single idea, stimuli,
or concept, the more likely it would be remembered better
(Huitt, 2003). The advocates of "Dual-Coding Theory"
(Clark & Paivio, 1991) suggested for two processing modes
such as verbal and non-verbal processings; for example,
mental images and verbal entities, chunks or prepositions are
being processed by different systems. Furthermore, there are
three separate types of processing and interaction between
these two systems such as representational, referential, and
associative processing. The "Schema theory of Information
Processing and Memory" developed by Rumelhart (1980)
proposes that information is stored in multiple locations
throughout the brain in the form of networks of connections;
thus, units of memory are connections rather than any con-
crete representation of previous information. The develop-
mental perspective of information processing as proposed by
Flavell, Miller, and Miller (2002) emphasizes that increased

Information Processing and Creative
Thinking Abilities of Residential and
Non-Residential School Children:
A Pilot Study
Atasi Mohanty1
Abstract
This study attempts to assess and compare the residential and non-residential schoolchildren in information-processing
skills and creative thinking abilities. A sample of 80 children from Classes 5 and 7 were selected from two types of schools,
residential/ashram (02) and non-residential/formal schools (02) in Bolpur subdivision of West Bengal in India where the
medium of instruction is Bengali language/mother-tongue. All the children were individually administered the PASS (Planning,
Attention, Simultaneous, Successive), Stroop, Matching Familiar Figure Test (MFFT-20), and creative thinking tasks. The
residential school children were found to perform better both in information processing and creative thinking tasks. The
developmental trend could not be clearly observed due to small sample size, but with increasing age, children were using
better processing strategies. Due to ashram environment, creative pedagogy, and various co-curricular activities, the
residential school children were found to be more creative than their formal school counterparts. Moreover, some significant
positive correlations were found among information processing skills and creative thinking dimensions.

processing capacity, speed, and efficiency takes place as a
result of biological maturation, knowledge development,
modifications of connections in neural networks, repeated
self-organization, and meta-cognition. As the child becomes
more competent in structuring and organizing information
and uses his experience more often, he will be using the
metacognitive strategies more spontaneously and frequently
(Flavelletal.,2002).Sternberg's(1988)theoryof"Successful
Intelligence" based on information-processing approach
suggests that intelligence is comprised of three kinds of
information processing components: meta-components, per-
formance components, and knowledge acquisition compo-
nents; all these work together to facilitate learning and
cognitive development. Developmental changes take place
as a result of feedback, self-monitoring, social interaction,
and automization. Later on, Sternberg has also added the
concepts of practical intelligence and creative intelligence in
his theory. Kogan (1983) in his model refers to information
processing as individuals' variations in modes of perceiving,
remembering, thinking, and so on, or as different ways of
apprehending, storing, transforming, and utilizing informa-
tion. Das, Naglieri, and Kirby (1994) in their "PASS Theory"
(Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, Successive) have ana-
lyzed information processing as an act of cognitive pro-
cesses, which indicate how the individual approaches a task
or problem, the strategies, and plans he uses to reach a solu-
tion. Much closer to their definition, Halpern (1996) articu-
lated this concept as critical thinking and defined this as "the
use of cognitive skills or strategies that increase the probabil-
ity of a desirable outcome" (p. 5). Burden and Byrd (1994)
classified critical thinking as a higher-order cognitive activ-
ity that requires a set of cognitive skills such as reasoning,
intellectual curiosity, sense of responsibility, perseverance,
reflective thinking, and so on.
Thus, the above discussion on some of the core informa-
tion processing research revealed that the human cognition/
thinking is to be understood through an account of the repre-
sentation of the information and of processes that manipulate
this information. So far as the hierarchies of cognitive pro-
cesses and multi-dimensional functioning of human cogni-
tion/intellect, Bloom, Englehart, Furst, Hill, and Krathwohl's
(1965) "Taxonomy of cognitive Domain," Guilford's (1971)
"Analysis of Intelligence," and Anderson and Krathwohl's
(2000) "Revised Bloom Taxonomy" are considered to be
path-breaking works in integrating all, from simple to higher-
order thinking processes, for successful problem solving in
the field of education. Bloom etal. had proposed a six-level-
based "Taxonomy of Educational objectives" based on the
learning hierarchy, that is, knowledge, comprehension, appli-
cation, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Later on, other
researchers have modified and revised the model as knowl-
edge, comprehension, application, analysis, evaluation, and
creativity, after proposing that evaluation is less difficult than
synthesis and both incorporate different types of processing
(Anderson & Krathwohl, 2000; Huitt, 2003). However, there
was a consensus among researchers that even though both
synthesis and evaluation are based on the ability to analyze,
compare, contrast the parts of the whole, and understand
their interrelationships, the type of thinking/cognitive pro-
cessing involved in synthesis is often called "Creative think-
ing," and in evaluation, it is called "Critical thinking."
Thus, creative thinking/creativity is considered to be the
highest level of cognitive process, which automatically
includes all other lower cognitive processes while enacting a
creative thought. Guilford (1967, 1971) had reported that
"divergent thinking" is much closer to creativity, which
includes four basic components such as fluency, flexibility,
originality, and elaboration. Torrance (1965) defined creativ-
ity as the process of forming different ideas or hypothesis,
testing these hypotheses, evaluating its effectiveness, and
communicating the outcomes and its utilities. Later on,
Torrance, Orlow, and Safter (1990) identified a set of cre-
ative attributes/thinking abilities such as fluency, flexibility,
originality, elaboration, abstractness of the title, resistance to
closure, emotional expressiveness, articulateness action,
expressiveness, synthesis, internal as well as unusual visual-
ization, braking the boundaries, humor, fantasy, richness,
colorfulness of imagery, and so on, for being truly creative or
engaged in creative act. Gardner (1985) has interpreted cre-
ativity as a complex construct and most likely/commonly is
being expressed through a broad range of intelligence,
including linguistic, musical, mathematical, spatial, kines-
thetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. Wright (1987)
reported about some home environment factors such as
respect for the child, the stimulation of independence, and
enriched learning environment encourage creativity among
children. Weisberg (1999) proposed that creativity involves
essentially ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordi-
nary products. He attempted to show that the insights depend
on subjects using conventional cognitive processes (such as
analogical transfer) applied to knowledge already stored in
memory. Longley, Zytkow, Simon, and Bradshow (1987)
made a similar claim about the ordinary nature of creative
thinking. Cultural background was also found to have an
impact on creativity (Baker, Rudd, & Domeroy, 2000;
Sharma & Naruka, 1983; Torrance, 1981). Researchers have
pointed out that besides personal attributes, some key educa-
tional factors play key role in the development of creativity
among students, that is, teacher's teaching style (exercise,
tactical strategic training; Jausovoc, 1988), students' learn-
ing styles (Isaacs, 1987), critical thinking, knowledge moti-
vation, and creative response style being transacted in the
educational setting. Most importantly, students' intrinsic
motivation and motivation to excel in every field/work often
lead to creative excellence (Sternberg & Luppart, 1991;
Torrance, 1997).
However, the literature review on creativity research has
primarily categorized these into four parts, that is, four p's/
factors such as person, process, product, and press/place.
Empirical research have been done on each of these aspects,
Mohanty 3
thus accumulating huge amount of work. The first category
of "person" relates to the cognitive abilities, biological traits,
and psycho-physical traits of creative people. The second
category, "process," refers to mental processes or stages of
creative thinking that backs up creative work. The third one,
"product," means creative output/product, which can be
measured/evaluated through its novelty, originality, authen-
ticity, fluency, elaboration, effectiveness, and utility. The
fourth category is "press," which refers to the enriched envi-
ronment context, which boosts the creative thinking and
actions among individuals (Beghetto, Kozbelt, & Runco,
2010). Feldhusen (2002) reported that the phenomenon cre-
ativity has been extensively and successfully researched at
higher level in case of talented adults and less explicitly in
case of children or common man. Thus, children can be
given a secondary role at the periphery of creative expression
known as "low range creativity" or "creative spontaneity"
(Feldman in Sawyer et
al., 2003). Researchers have also
acknowledged that there are different types of creative contri-
bution. For example, Gardner (1994) has described different
types of creative contributions individuals can make, such as
(a) solving a well-defined problem, (b) devising and encom-
passing theory, (c) creating a "frozen work," (d) performing a
ritualized work, and (e) rendering a "high-stake" perfor-
mance. Similarly, according to Taylor (1959), there were five
typologies for creativity, that is, expressive, productive,
inventive, innovative, and emergentive. Expressive type is
the spontaneous creativity often seen among children through
their play and drawings. Productive creativity is being dem-
onstrated by scientists and artists. Inventive creativity may be
described as problem solving or updating the existing tech-
nology. Innovative creativity manifests in reinventing an
existing system/organism/object through the utilization of
conceptual skills. Emergentive creativity is the creation of
entirely new paradigm/opening/discovery/hybrid product,
and so on. Thus, from the above discussion, we can appar-
ently conclude that creativity would express itself in different
forms depending on the right combination of particular set of
abilities, skills, personality traits, and environment.
Moreover, creativity being a cognitive act involves cer-
tain processes to reach at the output/product. It is also evi-
dent from the above literature that very few attempts have
been made to relate these two significant cognitive compo-
nents, that is, intelligence/information processing and cre-
ativity, and what sort of relationship they share with each
other. The review of research findings on these two concepts
reveals that the pattern of relationship between these two is
positive but not linear in nature. That is, to be creative, a
person must possess certain minimum (optimum) level of
intelligence (such as grasping power, analytical skills, or
ability for integrating various components etc.), but highly
intelligent persons may not be equally creative. As we know,
creativity being a cognitive act also involves different ways
of thinking, that is, flexibility, originality, openness, fluency,
elaboration, and so on, through which new solutions to
various problems are arrived at. But here, the question is how
the creative people process the information when they are
engaged in a creative act. Do they process these in a different
way or like any other normal/average individual? Is there
any specialty about creative thinking or is it just as other cog-
nitive processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solv-
ing, and so on. Out of various information processing models
that have emerged out of cognitive-processing approach to
assess intelligence, the author found that only in Sternberg's
(1999) model of "Successful Intelligence" the component of
creative intelligence has been incorporated. He and his asso-
ciates found that the best predictor of creative aspects of
thinking seemed to be the efficiency with which an individ-
ual is able to transition between conventional and unconven-
tional ways of thinking. The other information processing
models such as Das et
al.'s (1994) PASS, Cairns and
Cammock's (1978) "Reflection­Impulsivity" model, and
Gardner's (1993) `Multiple intelligences" model describe
different modes of information processing such as different
ways of apprehending, storing, transforming, and utilizing
the information. At this point of discussion, it strikes to the
present researcher whether the creative individuals process
the information in a similar fashion as normal ones or in a
different mode. What is their specialty if it exists? This insti-
gated the present author to take up this study.
Moreover, there is a growing realization among the intel-
lectual mass that creativity is no more a privilege for a hand-
ful of people/the chosen few, but it is the basic human
endowment present among all, in different measures. Creative
potentiality is often not recognized systematically and nur-
tured properly. The failure generally begins in the school at an
early stage and continues throughout life. In this context,
Piaget's and Vygotsky's theories have great relevance in
understanding the children's (developmental) psychology,
that is, the process of learning to think and thinking to learn.
Piaget (1896-1980) advocates learning as construction,
and his theory encourages hands-on learning. Piaget believed
that through assimilation and accommodation processes, the
individuals try to adapt themselves in the new environment
and maintain equilibrium/cognitive harmony. Whereas,
Vygotsky (1962, 1978) believed that the learner constructed
his or her knowledge by interacting with others in the soci-
ety. Thus, social interaction plays an important role in stu-
dent learning, and his theory advocates for gradual changes
in learning and development through increasing social con-
tacts, language, and social interactions. His philosophy was
what is learnt must be taught by the teachers, who should
explain, model and use guided practices in the classroom.
Allowing the students to think aloud and work through their
assigned tasks are effective instruction strategies at elementary
and middle school levels. (Vygotsky, 2004, pp. 9-97)
According to Piaget (1896-1980) in this context, the most
important aim of education is not to train individuals who
4 SAGE Open
repeat the previous generations, but to train inventors who
are creative and possess the skill of producing new things
(Anwar, Shamim-Ur-Rasool, & Haq, 2012). Edward and
David (1982) have emphasized that both creative and critical
thinking should be involved in the teaching­learning process
and curricula, through the context, activities, and assessment
in school subjects, especially math and science. Thus, it is
being felt by the educationists that the creative ability should
be detected very early in life, so that it can be nurtured prop-
erly to reach the culminating point. The National Policy on
Education(NPE;1986/1992),NationalCouncilofEducational
Research and Training (NCERT; 1986, India), National
Curriculum Framework (NCF; 2005), and several other com-
missions have all along advocated for the need to develop
both the creative and critical thinking among the schoolchil-
dren through inducing spontaneity, curiosity, original think-
ing, independent analysis, courage to ask questions, scientific
temper, and so on. The child-centered approach as articulated
by NPE (India) also emphasizes the development of creative
thinking and problem-solving abilities to make the teaching­
learning process more successful and innovative in nature. It
would also enhance the skill of "learning to learn" among the
children, and for this, it is very urgent to know how they pro-
cess the information collected from the environment. Even
though numerous studies have been conducted on various
dimensions of creative ability and cognitive-processing skills,
rare attempts have been made to relate these two components
in an educational set up, especially at the elementary educa-
tion level. Nowadays, creativity is increasingly gaining
importance across the fields, from school education to profes-
sional world and corporate sectors as well. Even though
researchers have found that creative thinking can contribute
significantly to the acquisition of information and educational
skills (Gotoh, 2004; Krulik & Rudnik, 1999), the empirical
findings on the relationship between creativity and intelli-
gence/academic achievement are still inconclusive. This has
prompted the researcher to explore the answers to these fol-
lowing questions.
Research Questions
Research Question 1: Is there any difference among resi-
dential/ashram and non-residential/formal schoolchildren
in information processing and creative thinking skills?
Research Question 2: Would there be any developmental
trend among the schoolchildren?
Research Question 3: What would be the pattern of rela-
tionship between information processing and creative
thinking abilities?
Method
Sample
A sample of 80 school-going children (sharing the similar
demographic characteristics), 40 each from Classes 5 and 7
have been selected from two types of schools, that is, residen-
tial/ashram schools and non-residential/formal schools. The
two schools, Pathabhavan and Siksha­Satra of Visva­Bharati
University at Santiniketan in West Bengal, India were the two
ashram schools and the other two schools called Srinanda
High School and Vivekanda Vidyapith under the West Bengal
board (WB) of secondary education were taken as the non-
residential/formal schools. All these schools were Bengali/
mother-tongue medium schools located in the Bolpur subdi-
vision of Birbhum district in West Bengal, India. The samples
were drawn from Classes 5 and 7 of these four schools
through stratified-random (sampling) technique.
Tools/Tasks Used
The following tools such as Das, Naglieri, and Kirby's PASS
processing tasks, Matching Familiar Figure Test (MFFT-20)
task, Stroop task, and Baquer Mehdi's creative thinking tasks
were used in this study.
a. Planned connection task: In this planning task, each
subject is required to connect all the numbers in the
worksheet as quickly as possible. There are two condi-
tions where in Condition 1, the subject has to connect
1 to 2, 2 to 3, numbers only, and in Condition 2, he or
she has to connect both numbers and letters such as 1
to A, A to 2, 2 to B, and B to 3 likewise.
b. Visual search: This is also a planning task, where the
subject's task is to point out the object, number, or letter
in the response-field background that matches the tar-
get located in the centre box. Each item consists of two
searches presented in a single page. For each subtask
(item page), the subject's score is the time taken by him
or her. The items are of high and low density and auto
and control search in nature. In auto-search items, the
target figures are different from that of background fig-
ures, whereas in control search, both are of same class.
c. Selective attention: This is an attention task of PASS
model. There are two types of cards in this task, one
for name matching, and the other for picture matching.
The score would be given according to the subjects'
accuracy in matching the picture and the name.
d. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM):
This is a non-verbal reasoning task consisting of 36
matrices or designs, each having a part removed from
it. The subject's task is to decide the missing part, and
insert it from six possible alternatives given there. As
the child is required to simultaneously evaluate and
search all the alternatives to find out the correct one,
Das etal. (1994) have used this test in their model
(PASS) as a good measure of simultaneous process-
ing. The scores would be given to the correct respons-
es made by the subjects.
e. Figure copying: This has also been used as a measure of
simultaneous processing. The task requires the subject
to copy 15 geometrical figures that are visible to him or
Mohanty 5
her. Each drawing is scored as 0, 1, or 2 according to the
degree of accuracy of reproduction of figures.
f. Digit Span: The test is similar to Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Children­Revised (WISC-R; Wechsler,
1974) "Digit Span Forward" subtest that has been
used here as a successive processing task. The subject
is required to recall a series of digits, keeping the or-
der/sequence of these digits intact. Each correct score
would be counted for the recall of correct digit with its
respective order/position of presentation.
g. Serial recall: This is another successive processing
task used by Das etal. in the PASS model. Here, the
subject's task is to recall a series of words, with their
respective position/order intact.
h. Matching Familiar Figure Test (MFFT-20 by Cairns
& Cammock, 1978): This test measures the informa-
tion processing style of the subjects such as reflective
or impulsive processing style. The subject has to find
out the exact figure (replica) of the target figure (given
on the top) out of six alternatives. The experimenter
records latency to the first response, total number of
errors for each item, and the order in which these are
made. The subject could get maximum five chances to
select the correct answer. Number of errors and time
taken would be recorded by the experimenter.
i. Stroop Colour­Word Interference Task: This task has
been used to measure the amount of cognitive interfer-
ence. The time taken by the subject to complete each
task and the number of errors committed by him or her
were recorded.
j. Baquer Mehdi's (1973) Creative Thinking Test: In this
task, there are some incomplete figures, lines, and
shapes, which one has to take as the base and then
draw a novel and interesting picture out of his imagi-
nation and give an appropriate title to explain it.
Design
This is a quasi-experimental design having two independent
variables, such as types of school and grade/class, and again
having two levels such as (a) ashram/residential and formal/
non-residential schools and (b) Classes 5 and 7. Thus, it is a
2 × 2 factorial design study. In the present study, 10 assess-
ment tools/tasks were used, and in total, there were 31 depen-
dent measures.
Procedure
All the tools and tasks were individually administered on all
the subjects (N = 80) in the sample. The collected data were
further analyzed through various statistical tests.
Data Analyses and Interpretation
The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistical
techniques such as mean (X), standard deviation (), t tests,
and Pearson Product Moment correlation (r). In the follow-
ing section, both the quantitative and qualitative interpreta-
tions are given (see Tables 1 and 2).
As the findings reveal, the ashram school children per-
formed better in various dimensions of creative thinking test,
that is, originality, elaboration, and flexibility. Ashram
schoolchildren also outperformed their non-residential coun-
terparts in almost all the information processing tasks. The
developmental trend could not be clearly observed in case of
creative ability, due to small sample size, but it appears that
children are using better processing strategies with increas-
ing age. Due to small sample constraint, the t test could not
be done individually in case of all 31 dependent variables.
The total scores and grand means were taken to compare the
ashram and non-ashram schoolchildren on broad measures,
that is, total information processing and creative measures
(see Tables 3 and 4).
Table 3 shows the correlations among all the information
processing and creative thinking measures (31) as found in
case of Grade 5 children. Besides the interrelationships within
the same group of measures such as information processing
or creative thinking measures, some other significant positive
correlations have been observed such as between selective
attention and creativity­elaboration measures (r = .313*),
simultaneous processing (RCPM) and creativity­originality
measures (r = .490*** and .398***), simultaneous process-
ing (RCPM) and creativity­flexibility measures (r = .323*).
Table 4 presents the correlation (r) values as found in case of all
the Grade 8 children. Here, also besides the inter-correlations
among various information processing measures and creative
thinking measures separately, some of the significant positive
correlations are observed between arousal/attention measure
and creativity­originality measure (r = .342* and .341*);
simultaneous processing (RCPM) and creativity­originality
measures (r = .326*, .429***, and .559***); simultaneous
processing (RCPM) and creative-elaboration (r = .350* and
.348*); simultaneous processing (RCPM) and creativity­
flexibility measures (r = .391* and .501***); simultaneous
processing (figure copying) and creativity­originality mea-
sures (r = .530*** and .411***); the successive processing
(Digit Span) with creativity­elaboration measure (r = .317*);
and successive processing (Serial recall) with creativity­
originality (r = .350*) measure; Another significant factor
observed here was that the planning measures were nega-
tively correlated to creative ability measures. Thus, with
regard to the relationship between information processing
skills and creative abilities, the major findings are
·
· a. The arousal/attention dimension of information
processing is found to be significantly and positively
related to originality and elaboration dimensions of
creative thinking,
·
· b. The simultaneous processing ability is significantly
and positively correlated to three dimensions such as
originality, elaboration, and flexibility of creative
thinking, and
6 SAGE Open
·
· c. The successive processing ability, also is found to
be significantly and positively correlated to both the
originality and elaboration dimensions of creative
ability.
However, one more significant result is that the planning
skills are negatively related to all the three, that is, original-
ity, elaboration, and flexibility dimensions of creative ability
(as evident in Table 4, r = -.350*,-.361*, -.391*, -.327*,
-.326*, -.347*, -.392*, -.313*, and Table 3, r = -.374*,
-.351*, -.344*,).
Discussion
As the findings show (both Tables 1 and 2), the ashram/resi-
dential schoolchildren performed significantly better than
the formal/non-residential schoolchildren in all the informa-
tion processing and creative thinking tasks. Due to small
sample size in this pilot study, the researcher couldnot make
a comparison among various subgroups. Hence, the t test
was done to compare the main groups such as school types
and class, where in each case, the N = 40. Even though there
are 31 dependent variables in Table 1, the total scores and
grand means were taken for t test to compare the ashram
and formal schoolchildren on total information processing
and creative measures. However, from Table 1, it is very
much evident that the ashram schoolchildren's (both Classes
5 and 7) mean scores are higher in all the dimensions of infor-
mation processing, that is, selective attention, simultaneous
processing, successive processing, planning skills, as well as
both the verbal and non-verbal dimensions of creative think-
ing, that is originality, elaboration, and flexibility. This implies

that the ashram schoolchildren are fully utilizing their infor-
mation processing skills and creative thinking abilities. The
researcher also observed that even though both the Visva­
Bharati (VB) ashram schools and WB formal schools had
adopted the CCE (Continuous and Comprehensive-
Evaluation) patterns, the Tagore philosophy-based
VB-ashram school environments were more enriched, stimu-
lating, natural, and stress-free in comparison to formal
schools located in a more crowded semi-urban area (in
Bolpur town). The teachers in both types of schools were
well trained and following the guidelines of CCE pattern.
However, the infrastructure and curricula followed in
VB-ashram schools were more enriched and innovative,
which encouraged both the ashram schoolchildren and teach-
ers to engage themselves in various solo and group activities,
which were often missing in WB formal schools. Moreover,
the VB-ashram schoolteachers were more motivated to
engage the children in various curricular and extra-curricular
activities than their formal school counterparts, as they were
taking pride in being a part of VB-ashram culture. Most of
the teachers had themselves been the students of VB schools.
The researcher wants to point out here that the VB-ashram/
residential school environments (2 schools) are completely
different from any other residential school with respect to
academic, socio-cultural, philosophical, as well as physical
atmosphere. VB (residential) schools and ashram environ-
ment provide enough opportunity for freedom of thought,
imagination, and creative expression. Probably, this has
encouraged the spirit of creative thinking and problem-solv-
ing ability of ashram schoolchildren. Moreover, this finding
could be asserted from the fact that the ashram schools (VB)
have got an unique curriculum and method of teaching that
incorporate various extra-curricular activities such as draw-
ing, painting, dance, music, one-act-play, recitation, poetic
sessions, discussion on current social problems, horticulture,
plantation, pottery making, weaving, cloth printing, making
toys, artistic pieces from papers and leaves, and so on. The
children learn from naturalistic observation and by doing
themselves. The teachers emphasize on self-learning and for-
mative and qualitative evaluation. The children attend
weekly programs such as "Kabi Sabha," "Sahitya Charcha,"
"Darshan Class," and so on, and their knowledge, skills, and
creative thoughts are being evaluated instantly when they are
actually performing it. The whole school environment (cam-
pus,curriculum,andculture)hasbeenattunedtoRabindranath
Tagore's philosophy of naturalistic education. Thus, it is
observed that this "ashramic" education nourishes some
basic skills and competencies among its children that develop
the sensitivity in perceiving a problem, analyzing and defin-
ing it in details, eagerness to look for more information,
searching for alternative solutions and unusual ideas, seeking
new relationships among various components, using a reflec-
tive strategy for self-evaluation before taking the final deci-
sion, willingness to accept conflicting ideas, intuitive
thinking, and so on. Possibly, these could be the reasons why
ashram schoolchildren invariably performed better in all the
dependent measures (i.e., information-processing skills and
creative thinking abilities).
As far as the second research question is concerned, it is
found that even though some developmental trend had been
found in case of information-processing skills and creative
abilities of ashram schoolchildren only, it could not be firmly
established, due to small sample size. In this regard, few
empirical studies showed that both extrinsic and intrinsic
motivation can co-exist in the classroom situations (Corpus
& Wormington, 2011), which can drive forward the process
of creativity (Amabile & Hennessey, 2009). Often, cultural
differences might influence creativity (Erez & Nouri, 2010).
A recent study has also supported the view that learning
environment positively affect the thinking style of children
and encourage them to generate more creative ideas and
activities (Alghafri & Ismail, 2014). In the present study, it is
observed that the formal schoolchildren were not exposed to
any such stimulating/creative environment or such tasks.
However, the present researcher feels that effective curricula
and pedagogy, enriched and collaborative environment, flex-
ible, and open-ended learning can boost the thinking skills
among children.
With regard to the third research question, the relationship
between information processing and creative thinking abili-
ties, it is found that (see Tables 3 and 4, Figure 1) attention
and successive processing skills correlate significantly and

positively with the originality and elaboration dimensions of
creative thinking; simultaneous processing skill is found to
correlate significantly and positively with all the three major
dimensions of creative ability, that is, originality, elaboration,
and flexibility. Thus, it implies that the effective use of atten-
tion, successive, and simultaneous processing strategies help
the children in perceiving, analyzing, and synthesizing the
information in a more creative manner that boost their original
ideas, innovative thoughts, and could bring better flexibility,
variety, elaboration, and clarity in creative thinking process.
So far as the relationship of creativity with other cognitive
processes is concerned, a recent study by Anwar etal. (2012)
revealed that at school level, high achievers are not signifi-
cantly different from low achievers in terms of creative
thinking abilities. In this study, the creative abilities of sec-
ondary schoolchildren did not correlate with their achieve-
ment scores. Hence, the relationship between creativity and
academic intelligence has again become debatable. However,
these researchers found the gender and urban locations to be
the significant influencing factors in children's creative think-
ing abilities. Another study has also confirmed that school
contexts and classroom environment influence the creative
abilities of children, and for understanding the pattern of rela-
tionship between children's motivation and creative abilities,
we need to study different types of schools and its learning
environment (Amin & Regander, 2011). From these findings,
we can assume that creative thinking is a significant compo-
nent of (human) higher-order thinking process, and in case of
children, it remains in a very primitive, fluid form; it requires
a combination of other ingredients such as right environment,
skills, personality attributes, as well as nourishment/training
for getting manifested into a more crystallized form of cre-
ative product/outcome. Hence, for drawing a conclusion,
more number of empirical research studies are required in
creativity training and applications field. The classroom
instructions designed to promote creative thinking can also
increase the probability of academic success among the low
achievers. The current-age researchers have also advocated
for teaching the thinking skills to primary-level schoolchil-
dren and that strategic teaching, critical, and creative thinking
should be well integrated in the school curriculum (Alghafri
& Ismail, 2014). Here, Sternberg's theory of successful intel-
ligence can be taken as a reference point where it has been
elaborately discussed how intelligence can be successfully
utilized for creativity and every individual should strive to
acquire/develop the creative intelligence.
Conclusion and Future Work
Thus, from this pilot study (with a small sample size), the
researcher could assume that the information-processing
skills such as attention, successive and simultaneous pro-
cessing are the pre-requisites for conceptualizing the original
idea, elaborating it, using it more flexibly for different pur-
poses, and working on the different dimensions of creative
thinking, which resemble divergent thinking. However,
when the individual would actually proceed toward creative
act or manifestation of this creative thoughts/potentials, he
has to converge his ideas into one selected topic/plan/blue
print; thus, ultimately, both intelligence and creativity or
divergent and convergent thinking merge into one point, ven-
turing toward creative product/innovative practices/creative
intelligence, the ultimate goal of smart learning and higher
cognition. Moreover, educational experts have also recom-
mended for a holistic approach called "manifold thinking,"
based on the proper integration of creative, critical, reflec-
tive, and caring thinking (Valtanen, Berki, Kampylis, &
Thedorakopoulou, 2008). The school education should be a
platform of know-what, know-how, and know-why to foster
students' creative thinking in a constructive environment
(with multi sensory and collaborative learning experiences).
So far as the validity of this research findings are con-
cerned, the researcher wants to clarify its limitations due to
which it cannot be generalized. It was just a small attempt to
satisfy the intellectual curiosity. Even though the topic is very
interesting, there is a dearth of empirical studies in this direction.

The findings of the present study could not be generalized
because of small sample size, and one single state (West
Bengal) from which the sample has been drawn. To get a bet-
ter picture of the pattern of relationship among various infor-
mation processing and creative thinking abilities, more
number of empirical works are needed. Similarly, more num-
ber of ashram/residential schools should be studied to find out
the right inputs for creative learning environments. Even
though our curricula advocates for encouraging critical and
creative thinking among children, in reality, whether our for-
mal schools do seriously care about this or not, should also be
investigated. However, till today, VB-ashram school has been
the ideal learning environment for creative thinking, but how
the other residential, that is, the mushrooming international
schools are different from these should also be studied.
Implications
From the above discussion, it can be suggested that to stimu-
late the creative thinking and enhance the information-
processing skills among our children, we need to introduce
certain reforms in our school education system, such as (a)
curriculum to be based on problem-solving approach, (b)
emphasis to be given on using effective processing strategies
during learning, (c) to encourage self-learning and problem-
based learning, (d) creating avenues for innovative ideas and
original contributions, (e) flexibility and openness in teach-
ing­learning process and pedagogy, (f) adopting brainstorm-
ing technique in the instructional process to encourage
creative thoughts, and (g) encouraging the use of metacogni-
tive strategies for self-evaluation and knowledge construc-
tion. Prominent researchers and educationists have already
recommended for creativity-fostering strategies at primary
education level, which are equally oriented toward condu-
cive environment (CE), creative process (CP), and creative
student (CS; Kampylis, Saariluoma, & Berki, 2011).
At the end of this discussion, researcher wants to con-
clude that the educator must design the instruction, prepare
specific curriculum, and create a stimulating and flexible
learning environment, where children's thinking styles will
be promoted through better communication, interaction, col-
laboration, and hands-on activities, which would foster all
kinds of cognitive-processing abilities.
