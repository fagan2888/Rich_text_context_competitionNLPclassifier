Genetic studies of delinquent and criminal behavior are rare in spite of the wide recognition that
individuals may differ in their propensity for delinquency and criminality. Using 2524 participants in Add
Health in the United States, the present study demonstrates a link between the rare 2 repeat of the 30-bp
VNTR in the MAOA gene and much higher levels of self-reported serious and violent delinquency. The
evidence is based on a statistical association analysis and a functional analysis of MAOA promoter activity
using two human brain-derived cell lines: neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and human glioblastoma 1242-MG. The
association analysis shows that men with a 2R report a level of serious delinquency and violent delinquency
in adolescence and young adulthood that were about twice (CI: (0.21, 3.24), P ¼ 0.025; and CI: (0.37, 2.5),
P ¼ 0.008 for serious and violent delinquency, respectively) as high as those for participants with the other
variants. The results for women are similar, but weaker. In the functional analysis, the 2 repeat exhibits
much lower levels of promoter activity than the 3 or 4 repeat.

Introduction
Studies that investigate the connections between genetic
variants and delinquent and criminal behavior in humans
have been rare in spite of the wide recognition that
individuals may differ in the propensity to commit serious
delinquent and criminal acts.1 ­ 3
The MAOA gene has been a focus in the investigation of
aggression in animals and violent behavior in humans.
Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is one major enzyme that
catalyzes the oxidative deamination of a number of
biogenic amines in the brain, including dopamine. Because
of its ability to catabolize neurotransmitters, MAOA is
frequently a candidate gene in the study of psychiatric
diseases and behavioral traits. Evidence that implicates the
MAOA gene in aggressive behavior has come from knock-
out mouse models and human data. Cases et al4 and Shih
and Thompson5 developed a line of mice with a targeted
disruption of the MAOA gene. They observed an increase in
the brain levels of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephr-
ine, and an increase in manifested aggression among men.
Brunner et al6 reported mental retardation and impulsive
aggression among eight men in an extended Dutch family
with an uncommon sex-specific point mutation in the
MAOA gene.
The MAOA genomic sequences and promoters7 ­ 9 were
studied extensively in search of polymorphisms that might

be potentially associated with psychiatric disorders and
behavioral traits. These basic studies led to a discovery of a
30-bp promoter region VNTR in MAOA, affecting level of
transcriptional activity by Sabol et al.10 The PCR product
usually consists of five possible fragment sizes that include
2, 3, 3.5, 4, and 5 copies of the repeat sequence; the 3 and 4
repeats are much more common than the 2, 3.5, and 5
repeats in human populations. Sabol et al10 showed that
alleles with 3.5 (3.5R) or 4 (4R) copies of the repeat
sequence are transcripted more efficiently than alleles with
3 (3R) or 5 (5R) copies of the repeat. Sabol and colleagues
did not examine the MAOA 2R.
Caspi et al11 did not find a main effect of MAOA variants,
but reported that maltreated male children in New Zealand
with the 3R or 5R of the VNTR in MAOA were more likely to
engage in violent behavior than maltreated children with
the 3.5R or 4R of the VNTR. Widom and Brzustowicz12
reported a replication of these results. Haberstick et al13
failed to replicate the gene­environment interaction
findings in this same Add Health data set used in this
study. The present study focuses on the main effects of
MAOA variants. Meyer-Lindenberg et al14 studied the
impact of the MAOA VNTR on brain structure and function
with MRI in a large sample of healthy human volunteers.
The study showed that the low expression variants predict
differences in the size of limbic structures such as the
amygdala and that men with the low expression variants
exhibited increased reactivity of the left amygdale and
hippocampus during the recall of aversive information.
The objective of this study is twofold. The First, to
investigate the association between the self-reported
serious and violent delinquency and the 30-bp VNTR in
the MAOA gene in a cohort of 2524 adolescents and young
adults in the United States in the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The specific
hypothesis is that the MAOA 2R is associated with higher
levels of delinquency. Second, to perform a functional
analysis that evaluates the promoter activity in an MAOA
1.3-kb promoter-luciferase construct containing 2-, 3-, and
4-repeat sequences of the 30-bp VNTR, using two human
brain-derived cell lines: neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and hu-
man glioblastoma 1242-MG.
Materials and methods
Subject
The data source for our analysis is the sibling subsample of
2524 participants in the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health), which started as a
nationally representative sample of more than 20 000
adolescents in grades 7­12 in 1994­1995 (Wave I) in the
United States.15 Add Health is longitudinal; the respon-
dents have been followed by two additional in-home
interviews in 1995­1996 (Wave II) and 2001­2002 (Wave
III). Add Health was stratified by region, ethnic mix, size,
urbanicity (urban/suburban/rural), and school type (pub-
lic/private/parochial). Our analysis uses the sibling sample
of Add Health because DNA measures collected at Wave III
in 2002 are available only for this subset of the Add Health
respondents. Table 1 provides the mean (SD), proportion,
and frequency of the sample characteristics.
Measures
We constructed a serious delinquency scale and a violent
delinquency scale using the 12 questions asked to all the
Add Health respondents at Waves I­III. The questions and
scaling weights used to create the scales are given in
Appendix 1. These two scales are variations of a widely
used type of scales in contemporary research on delin-
quency and criminal behavior.16 Our scales are closely
related to the scales used by, for example, Hagan and
Foster17 and Haynie18,19 in the analysis of Add Health data
and by Hannon20 in the analysis of data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Youth. Our serious delinquency scale
overlaps with the delinquency scale of Hagan and Foster17
to a substantial extent. As the descriptor suggests, our
violent delinquency scale focuses on an array of violent
delinquent behavior that could potentially be classified as
violent offenses by the criminal justice system.

VNTR 2 repeat in MAOA and delinquent behavior

Following the delinquency literature,17 ­ 19 we divided
the 12 items into the nonviolent and violent types. The
nonviolent delinquency includes stealing amounts larger
or smaller than $50, breaking and entering, and drug
selling. Violent delinquency includes serious physical
fighting that resulted in injuries needing medical treat-
ment, use of weapons to get something from someone,
involvement of physical fighting between groups, shooting
or stabbing someone, deliberately damaging property, and
pulling a knife or gun on someone. The serious delin-
quency scale (nonviolent and violent) is based on the
entire 12 items and the violent scale is based on a subset (8)
of the 12 items. The Cronbach's a-values for the serious
delinquency scale for Waves I, II, and III are 0.81, 0.79, and
0.73, respectively. For Waves I, II, and III, the Cronbach's a -
values for the violent delinquency scale are 0.75, 0.74, and
0.66, respectively.
Measuring delinquency and crime is challenging. Offi-
cial measures based on the police reports and the justice
system have been long known to substantially under-
estimate delinquency and crime,16,21 ­ 23 because official
measures reflect not only the behavior of offenders, but
also the decisions made by the justice system. For these
reasons, many criminologists have turned to self-reports in
recent decades.24,25 Self-reports are now a fundamental
method of measuring criminality and seem capable of
yielding reliable and valid data.16
As with any survey of sensitive private information,
reporting accuracy is a concern. To protect confidentiality,
reduce nonresponses, and increase reporting accuracy, this
section of the interview in Add Health was self-adminis-
tered by audio-CASI (computer-assisted self-interview). The
sensitive question was read to respondents by means of
audio headphones. Respondents were given instructions by
the computer on how to complete their answers. Self-
reported rates of illegal and embarrassing behavior are
higher when computer-assisted techniques, particularly
self-administered techniques, are used.26,27
DNA preparation and genotyping
At Wave III, in collaboration with the Institute for
Behavioral Genetics in Boulder (CO, USA), Add Health
collected, extracted, and quantified DNA samples from the
sibling subsample. Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal
cells using a modification of published methods.28 ­ 31 All
of the methods employed Applied Biosystems instruments
and reagents. Microsatellite and VNTR polymorphisms
were performed using fluorescent primers that were
analyzed on an ABI capillary electrophoresis instrument.
To reduce errors, two individuals independently scored all
genotyping. The additional details on DNA collection and
genotyping can be found at Add Health website (Smolen
and Hewitt, http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/).
The MAOA-uVNTR polymorphism was assayed by a
modified method.10,13 The primer sequences for the
30-bp VNTR in the promoter region of the MAOA open
reading frame were: forward, 50ACAGCCTGACCGTGG
AGAAG-30 (fluorescently labeled); and reverse, 50-GAACGTG
ACGCTCCATTCGGA-30.10 The reaction yielded five frag-
ment sizes that included 291, 321, 336, 351, and 381 bp (2,
3, 3.5, 4, and 5 repeats, respectively). This analysis focuses
on the effect of 2R (291) vs all the other alleles. Only 11 men
possess a 2R. These 11 individuals are from 11 families with
six from six pairs of DZ twins and five from another five
families of full siblings. Of 31 women who possess one or
two 2R alleles, six are from three pairs of MZ twins, three
from three pairs of DZ twins, and 22 from 19 families of full
siblings. We performed a Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium test
for the 2R allele among women and obtained a w2-value of
0.012 for one degree of freedom indicating that the
equilibrium is not violated.
Analytical strategies
To test the associations of the MAOA 30-bp VNTR
polymorphisms with serious and violent delinquency, we
followed a three-step analytical strategy. The first step is a
contingency table analysis in which the mean scores of
serious delinquency and violent delinquency across geno-
types were compared within each Add Health Wave and
gender (Add Health Waves refer to the initial Add Health
study in 1994 and two follow-up studies in 1995­1996 and
2002).
The second step is regression analysis. Our sample
consists of twins and siblings as well as the repeated
observations of the same individual over different Add
Health Waves; these observations are not independent. The
mixed model has long been established in the statistical
literature for the analysis of data that are not indepen-
dent.32,33 The following equation describes the basic
structure of the mixed models used in our analysis

where j, i, and t index sibling pair or cluster, individual, and
Add Health Waves, respectively; s ¼ m, d, or f indicates
whether the sibling cluster or pair are MZ twins, DZ twins,
or full biological siblings. The basic trajectory of serious
and violent delinquency is described by age and age2, and
their parameters. The model allows the random effect at
the sibling cluster level and the level of observations to
vary by type of sibling cluster because the strength of the
correlation in these types of sibling clusters varies con-
siderably. Conditional on the three random intercepts at
the level of sibling clusters and one random intercept at the
individual level, the siblings and repeated measures
are assumed to be independent. The models are estimated
by SAS.

In our third step, we used two strategies to address the
potential impact of population structure. First, we adjusted
for self-reported race/ethnicity in all regression analysis.
Tang et al34 showed a near-perfect correspondence between
the four self-reported ethnic categories (European Amer-
icans, African Americans, East Asians, and Hispanics) and
the categories determined by 326 microsatellite markers.
As a second strategy, we applied the procedure by Allison
et al35 to test for possible population stratification.
Following the idea used in the development of sibship
tests of linkage and association,36 ­ 38 Allison et al reasoned
that the probabilities of genotypes of siblings depended
entirely on parental genotypes and that controlling for the
effects of sibship would be equivalent to controlling for
parental genotypes. Indexing sibships by j, individuals by
k, and genotypes by i, they proposed a procedure that can
be written as a mixed model

where ai
, or the effect of genotype i, is assumed to be fixed;

is an interaction term specifying the dependence of
the random effect of sibship on genotype. This model is a
special case of the mixed model.32,33
Functional analysis of promoter activity
The analysis of promoter activity was based upon two
human brain-derived cell lines: neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
and human glioblastoma 1242-MG. The MAOA 1.3-kb
promoter-luciferase construct was generated by PCR using
an MAOA 2-kb luciferase reporter gene construct (contain-
ing 4.5 repeat) as a template. The PCR product (MluI/
HindIII) of MAOA promoter fragment (À1336/À64 bp) was
cloned into the polylinker site (MluI/HindIII) upstream of
the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic vector. Site-directed
mutagenesis was utilized to generate 4, 3, and 2 repeats,
respectively, using the MAOA 1.3-kb promoter-luciferase
construct as a template (Figure 1). The three primers used
for mutagenesis of VNTR sites were the following (deleted

The mutated nucleotide sequences of all mutant con-
structs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections
in SH-SY5Y and 1242-MG cells were performed using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at a
density of 5 Â 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. In the
following day, 0.5 mg MAOA promoter-luciferase construct
(for one well) was co-transfected with 20 ng of plasmid
pRL-TK (the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase
promoter fused upstream to the Renilla luciferase gene,
which is used as an internal control; Promega) into the
cells as described previously. Controls were the pGL2-basic
luciferase reporter gene vector instead of MAOA promoter-
luciferase construct. After 24 h, cells were harvested with
luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega). The cell lysates were
assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega Dual
Luciferase Assay system.
Results
Contingency table analysis
Table 2 compares the mean score of serious and violent
delinquency across genotypes within each gender and each
of the three Add Health Waves. The number of observa-
tions and the standard deviation are also given for each
mean score in parentheses. The declining trend of both
serious and violent delinquency over the Waves is a
reflection of the well-known age pattern of delinquent
and criminal behavior. For men, the genetic variants on the
single X chromosome are grouped into three categories
based on the finding by Sabol et al (1998): 2R; 3R or 5R;
and 3.5R or 4R. The most striking result for men is the
much higher scores of those with a 2R allele than those in
the other two categories. The much higher score for 2R
holds for both serious and violent delinquency and is
present at all Waves of Add Health. In contrast, the
delinquency scores of those with 3R or 5R do not seem to
differ systematically from individuals with the 3.5R or 4R.
The delinquency score for 2R tends to be twice as high as
those in the other two genotype categories. The basic

findings remain the same whether 3.5R and 5R are
included or not, because 3.5R and 5R each account for
only about 1% of the samples in the data of Sabol et al as
well as ours.
Grouping women into genotype categories is less
straightforward because each woman possesses two X
chromosomes and it is unknown which of the two alleles
is inactivated. The female participants were classified into
three genotype categories: Any2R, those with only 3R or
5R, and those with 3.5R or 4R. For women in Table 2, the
2R stands out being associated with much higher scores for
both serious and violent delinquency at Waves II and III.
The serious and violent delinquency scores for the other
two genotype categories do not seem to differ from one
another.
Because of the sibling clustering in the data, standard
significance tests are not valid for these comparisons. The
next section presents significance tests for the genotype
effects obtained from the mixed regression models that
take the correlations into consideration. These exploratory
results suggest that the genotype effects may be relatively
constant over ages in adolescence and young adulthood, or
the trajectories of delinquency across genotypes appear to
be parallel over the age range.
Regression analysis
The regression analysis compares serious and violent
delinquency scores between the 2R genotype and all the
other genotypes within each gender after adjusting for the
effects of age and self-reported race/ethnicity (Table 3). The

regression analysis has yielded findings that are consistent
with those from the contingency table analysis (Table 2).
The regression coefficients in mixed models can be
interpreted exactly as those in the ordinary least square
linear regression. For men, the 2R genotype scored 1.72
(P ¼ 0.025) points higher than the other genotypes on the
serious delinquency scale. For the violent delinquency
scale, men with the 2R genotype scored 1.45 (P ¼ 0.008)
points higher than the other genotypes. Figure 2 plots the
model-predicted serious delinquency over age for those
with the 2R and those with 3R, 3.5R, 4R, or 5R. The 2Rs on
average scored about twice as high as the non-2Rs. The
effects of 2R for violent delinquency are similar to those in
Figure 1 and the data not presented. Using 3.5R or 4R as the
reference category in a reestimated regression model shows
that the 3R or 5R genotype does not differ from the 3.5R or
4R genotype.
The female effect of Any2R genotype is similar to the
male effect. Women with the Any2R genotype scored 0.47
(P ¼ 0.097) and 0.29 (P ¼ 0.108) points higher than the
other genotypes on the serious and violent delinquency
scales, respectively. These regression coefficients represent
a large increase in the serious and violent delinquency
scores among women.
To address potential bias from population stratification,
we controlled for self-reported race/ethnicity in all regres-
sion models presented in Table 3. In addition, we
performed the procedure of Allison et al4 (Equation (2))
The model includes one random effect (bj

cluster level, a second random effect at the individual level

), and the key interaction term [(ab)ij
] between
genotype and the random effect at the sibling-cluster level.
In all Allison's models we have estimated, the random
interaction term is not significant indicating that within-
family effects may not be sufficiently influential to
generate population stratification.
Promoter activity
To test whether the statistical link between the MAOA
VNTR 2R and delinquency has a biochemical basis, we
carried out an analysis of MAOA promoter activity by
genotype. As shown in Figure 3, the transient transfection
and luciferase assay reveals three levels of promoter activity
for the three 30-bp nucleotide repeat sequences in MAOA
in SH-SY5Y and 1242-MG cells. The 4R sequence exhibited
a higher level of promoter activity than the 3R sequence.
Alleles with the 3.5R or 4R sequence had been previously
shown to transcribe more efficiently than those with the
3R or 5R sequence.10 Our finding is that the 2R sequence of
the MAOA promoter displayed the lowest level of promoter

harvested and luciferase activity was determined. Controls were pGL2-Basic vector as indicated. Please note that 2-repeat sequence of MAOA promoter
shows the lowest activity and 4-repeat sequence of MAOA promoter shows the highest activity. Data were the mean±SD from three independent
experiments with triplicates for each experiment. The six t-tests (three for each cell) between 2 and 3 repeats, 2 and 4 repeats, and 3 and 4 repeats are
all highly significant (t46).

activity. In both SH-SY5Y and 1242-MG cells, the level of
promoter activity for the 2R sequence is substantially lower
than that of the 3R and only a fraction of that for 4R. The
extremely low level of promoter activity in the 2R sequence
corresponds to the much heightened level of serious and
violent delinquency for the 2R genotype.
We performed a series of t-tests between the 2R, 3R, 4R,
and the controls (pGL2-Basic) and among 2R, 3R, and 4R
(3R vs 2R, 4R vs 2R, and 3R vs 4R). All the t-tests are highly
significant, with t-ratios reaching 10 or above in most
cases. The smallest t-ratio is 6.
Discussion
Genetic studies of serious delinquent and criminal beha-
vior in non-patient or general human populations are rare.
Caspi et al11 reported an interaction between maltreatment
in childhood and level of MAOA activity for violent
behavioral problems; they did not find a main effect of
the MAOA gene. Chen et al39 hypothesized the association
of aggressive behavior in adolescents with both the
dopamine D2 receptor gene and the dopamine transporter
gene. They provided suggestive evidence from a small
study of 11 adolescents diagnosed to have impulsive­
aggressive violent behavior. Guo et al40 reported the main
effects of the TaqI polymorphism in the DRD2 gene and the
40-bp VNTR in the DAT1 gene on serious and violent
delinquency among men in the same Add Health data.
The present study demonstrated a link between the 2
repeat of the 30-bp VNTR in the MAOA gene and much
higher levels of self-reported serious and violent delin-
quency. The finding is supported by a statistical association
analysis and a functional analysis of MAOA promoter
activity. The association analysis showed that men with a
2R reported a level of serious delinquency in adolescence
and young adulthood that were at least twice as high as
that for those with the other variants in the VNTR. A very
similar finding was obtained for violent delinquency for
men. Women with Any2R also reported much higher levels
of serious and violent delinquency than those with other
repeats, although the P-values associated with these
estimates are 0.097 and 0.108, respectively.
In the functional analysis, the 2 repeat exhibited the
lowest level of promoter activity, that is, 25­30% of the
promoter activity exhibited by the 4 repeat. The level of
promoter activity for the 3 repeat is located between the 2
and 4 repeats, which is consistent with the previous
report.10 The excessively low promoter activity of the 2R
suggests a biochemical basis for the excessively high levels
of serious and violent delinquency.
Although the promoter activity differs significantly
between 3R and 4R, we did not find a significant difference
in serious and violent delinquency between those posses-
sing 3R and those possessing 4R. This result is not
inconsistent with the findings reported by Caspi et al,11
who found a higher level of violent behavior for 3R (and
5R) than 4R (and 3.5R) only among men who were
maltreated in childhood. Kim-Cohen et al41 reported a
main effect of 3R against 4R as well as an interaction effect
in a sample of 7-year old Caucasian boys born in England
and Wales.
Although our sample is large, the 2 repeat is rare.
Though the findings concerning 2R for men have passed
the standard tests of significance in spite of the small
category of 2R, it is possible that some of our findings
could be attributable to chance. For this reason, it is
important that these findings are replicated in a much
larger population-based study. Future replications may
prove the importance of the 2R allele, but the allele
cannot possibly be involved in most delinquent behavior
because of its rarity, just like the rare mutation in the
MAOA gene the Dutch family6 cannot explain most of the
delinquency.
The weaker results for women could be due to the
ambiguity in defining the X-linked MAOA VNTR genotypes
for women, which is equivalent to measurement errors.
The Any2R category used in the present study may include
those whose 2 repeat is not fully active. A test of this
hypothesis requires a much larger sample that contains a
sufficient number of participants homozygous for the 2
repeat.
Our measures of serious and violent delinquency are
constructed in the tradition of research on delinquency
and crime. Serious delinquency measures the overall
delinquency including violent delinquency, but it does
not include acts more typically viewed as common
adolescent deviance such as lying to parents/guardians
about where they had been, minor vandalism, being loud
in a public place, and driving a car without its owner's
permission. Violent delinquency measures violent
behavior that is typically treated as violent offense by
the criminal justice system. Our findings suggest that the
MAOA*2R may be more predictive of violent delinquency
than nonviolent delinquency. Future work should test this
hypothesis explicitly using nonviolent and violent
delinquency measures.

aFor this question, the score value on the scale is determined in the
following manner: the score is coded as zero if the event did not occur
in the past 12 months; the score is coded as one if the event occurred
once or twice in the past 12 months; the score is coded as two if the
event occurred three or four times in the past 12 months; the score is
coded as three if the event occurred five or more times in the past 12
months.
bFor this question, the score value on the scale is determined in the
following manner: the score is coded as zero if the event did not occur
in the past 12 months; the score is coded as three if the event did
occur once or more during the past 12 months.
In the construction of the serious delinquency scale, individuals with
more than two missing responses were excluded from analysis. In the
construction of the violent delinquency scale, individuals with more
than one missing response were excluded from analysis.
The violent scale is based upon 8 of the 12 items and they are items 1­
6, 11, and 12.
