Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is related to glucose metabolism in diabetic and nondiabetic persons. Analysis of
factors related to HbA1c may help researchers to better identify children with an increased likelihood of
developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, the authors investigated predictors of HbA1c percentage
among 1,700 Mexican-American, 1,787 African-American, and 1,441 non-Hispanic White young people aged 4­
17.0 years who were free of diabetes and were examined in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (1988­1994). HbA1c was positively related to age and body mass index (p = 0.065 and p = 0.008,
respectively) and negatively related to an indicator of socioeconomic status, the poverty income ratio (p = 0.008).
African Americans and Mexican Americans had higher mean HbA1c percentages than non-Hispanic Whites after
data were controlled for age, sex, body mass index, maternal body mass index, and poverty income ratio. While
some inconsistencies emerged, HbA1c was generally associated with other known risk factors for type 2 diabetes
in young people. This report provides representative data on HbA1c percentage among nondiabetic children.
However, further investigation will be needed to better understand the utility of HbA1c and its relation to type 2
diabetes in youth.

The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
are rapidly increasing in the United States, particularly
among children and adolescents (1­3). Little is known about
type 2 diabetes in children. The increase has been attributed,
in part, to increasing obesity and overweight among children
in the United States and in other parts of the world (4).
Several studies have indicated that the prevalence of obesity
among children and adolescents has increased alarmingly
during recent years (5­14). Similarly, physical inactivity has
been on the rise among children and adolescents in the
United States (15).
Most children or adolescents diagnosed with type 2
diabetes mellitus in the United States are overweight, have a
family history of type 2 diabetes, and display signs of insulin
resistance. Type 2 diabetes is reported more frequently in
females and in ethnic groups with increased risk (16­18).
Early detection of diabetes may be crucial in reducing the
impact of the disease among young people and their families.
In addition, analysis of factors related to impaired glucose
metabolism might lead to a better understanding of the
current rise in type 2 diabetes among children. Hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) is used as a quantitative measure of diabetes
control among persons with diabetes (26­28). Recently,
assessment of HbA1c percentage has been suggested as an
acceptable approach for diagnosing diabetes (19­21) and for
use as a screening tool for detecting type 2 diabetes in adults
(22­24) and children (25). In a follow-up study of older
adults without diabetes, HbA1c was found to be significantly
related to mortality from cardiovascular disease and

ischemic heart disease among women but not among men,
after data were controlled for possible confounders (29).
HbA1c percentages were directly related to the risk of
progression to diabetes mellitus among people with glucose
intolerance (30).
Peters et al. (21) conducted a meta-analysis and obtained
individual data from 11,276 subjects in 18 studies, for whom
HbA1c percentages were measured concurrently with oral
glucose tolerance tests, to determine whether HbA1c can be
used in place of the oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose
diabetes. The study showed that almost 90 percent of
patients with an HbA1c percentage higher than 7 percent
could be classified as having diabetes using the oral glucose
tolerance test.
Race/ethnicity has been shown to be significantly related
to HbA1c among people with diabetes, people with "border-
line diabetes," and people without diabetes. Among persons
with diabetes, African Americans were found to have a
higher mean HbA1c percentage than non-Hispanic Whites
(26). HbA1c was measured for 254 nondiabetic sixth- and
seventh-grade schoolchildren and was found to be higher
among minority children at increased risk of type 2 diabetes
than among non-Hispanic White children (25).
According to Fagot-Campagna et al. (31), among adoles-
cents aged 12­19 years who were examined in the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 4.1 per
1,000 (95 percent confidence interval: 0, 8.6); the prevalence
of elevated (>6 percent) HbA1c was 3.9 per 1,000 (95
percent confidence interval: 0.4, 7.4); and the prevalence of
an impaired fasting glucose level was 17.6 per 1,000 (95
percent confidence interval: 0.2, 35.0). Adolescents with an
increased HbA1c percentage were more likely to be African
Americans with a high body mass index (BMI).
The objective of this article was to identify predictors of
HbA1c among 4,928 nondiabetic young people who were
examined in NHANES III.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This analysis was based on data from NHANES III, which
was carried out in 1988­1994. Sampling and laboratory
methods have been described elsewhere (32, 33). The sample
used in this analysis included 4,928 persons aged 4­17.0
years. Pregnant women (n = 14), persons on insulin (n = 8) or
oral hypoglycemic agents (n = 1), and those not designated as
African-American, Mexican-American, or non-Hispanic
White (n = 306) were excluded from the sample. There were
no subjects with undiagnosed diabetes included in the sample
examined for this study (persons aged 4.0­17.0 years).

Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 8.0
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). This version of
SAS has new features (PROC SURVEYMEANS and
SURVEYREG) that account for complex sample designs.
Appropriate sampling weights were used for all analyses.
Individuals with missing values for any of the variables
included in the final analysis were excluded. The dependent
variable was HbA1c.
The independent variables included age (in years) at phys-
ical examination, race/ethnicity, sex, BMI (weight (kg)/
height (m)2), maternal BMI, and poverty income ratio.
Poverty income ratio was used as an indicator of socioeco-
nomic status. It is the ratio of a family's income to the
poverty threshold of a family of the same size for the same
calendar year. Maternal BMI was used as a crude measure of
familial, genetic, and environmental factors. Univariate and
multivariate linear regression analyses were performed for
assessment of the relation between HbA1c percentage and
the independent variables. Three categories were defined for
each of the continuous independent variables: age, poverty
income ratio, BMI, and maternal BMI. Unadjusted as well as
adjusted mean HbA1c percentages were calculated from
linear regression models treating these categories as dummy
variables. Then, treating age, poverty income ratio, BMI,
and maternal BMI as continuous variables, separate models
were created for six sex-race/ethnicity categories. Finally,
analyses were conducted for four age categories and eight
age-sex categories. Several interaction terms were examined
but were not found to be significant; thus, they were not
included in the final models. No corrections were made for
multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
The sample consisted of 1,700 Mexican-American, 1,787
African-American, and 1,441 non-Hispanic White children
who completed the medical examination; 49.3 percent were
males. African Americans and Mexican Americans were
overrepresented in the sample, because NHANES III was
designed to oversample these two ethnic groups. The
weighted mean age of the children studied was 10.72 years.
Characteristics of the sample and the weighted mean values
of the variables used in the analysis are given in table 1.
Non-Hispanic Whites were older at the time of examina-
tion, had a higher mean poverty income ratio, and had lower
values for HbA1c, BMI, and maternal BMI than African
Americans and Mexican Americans. The highest BMI and
maternal BMI were observed among Mexican Americans.
Sex was significantly associated with HbA1c percentage
(table 2). A regression analysis treating age, BMI, maternal

BMI, and poverty income ratio as continuous variables
showed that age was marginally related to HbA1c (p =
0.065). Mean HbA1c percentage increased with age among
children in the first four age quintiles (ages 4.00­13.50
years) and declined in the fifth quintile (ages 13.51­17.00
years) (figures 1, 2, and 3). This was true for African-Amer-
ican males and for females of all three ethnic groups, while
among non-Hispanic White and Mexican-American males, a
more linear association of HbA1c with age was apparent.
HbA1c was positively associated with BMI (figure 4) and
negatively associated with poverty income ratio (figure 5); p
values for trend were 0.15 and 0.001 for BMI and poverty
income ratio, respectively. However, after data were
controlled for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, this relation
became insignificant.
In the multivariate analysis, maternal BMI was signifi-
cantly associated with HbA1c after BMI was accounted for.
However, after data were controlled for age, sex, and race/
ethnicity, neither BMI nor maternal BMI was related to
HbA1c. African Americans and Mexican Americans had
higher mean HbA1c percentages than non-Hispanic Whites
after data were controlled for age, sex, BMI, maternal BMI,
and poverty income ratio. Females had a significantly lower
HbA1c percentage than males after other potentially
confounding variables in the model were accounted for
(table 2).
Separate regression models were constructed for each
ethnic group. After data were controlled for BMI and
maternal BMI, age, and poverty income ratio, sex was
related to HbA1c only among non-Hispanic Whites, with
females having significantly lower mean HbA1c percentages
than males. BMI was significantly associated with HbA1c
among African Americans and Mexican Americans but not
among non-Hispanic Whites after maternal BMI, age, sex,
and poverty income ratio were accounted for. When further
analyses were performed, BMI was associated with HbA1c
among African-American males and Mexican-American
females only (table 3).
When analyses were performed separately in the four age
strata, African Americans maintained a significantly higher
HbA1c percentage than did non-Hispanic Whites. Among
persons aged 15­17.0 years, HbA1c was significantly higher
in African Americans and Mexican Americans than in non-
Hispanic Whites. In the same age category, females had
significantly lower HbA1c percentages than males. When
the age categories were further stratified by sex, BMI was
significantly associated with HbA1c among males aged 10­
14 years and among females aged 15­17.0 years (table 4).

DISCUSSION
The results of this study confirm previous findings (25)
that race/ethnicity influences HbA1c percentage even among
healthy children. In the univariate analyses, many of the
demographic and anthropometric variables studied were
related to HbA1c. However, when race/ethnicity was taken
into account, most of these relations became insignificant.
Rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus are higher among African
Americans and Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic

Whites in the United States (34­38). Most cases of type 2
diabetes in children have been reported from minority popula-
tions (16­18). This analysis indicated that mean HbA1c
percentages were higher among nondiabetic African-Amer-
ican and Mexican-American young people than among non-
Hispanic Whites. We found that BMI was related to HbA1c
percentage among African-American and Mexican-American
children but not among Whites after data were controlled for
maternal BMI, age, sex, and poverty income ratio.
Although socioeconomic factors are thought to influence
type 2 diabetes risk, poverty income ratio was not strongly
related to HbA1c in these data, after the data were
controlled for race/ethnicity. The three ethnic groups
varied significantly with regard to poverty income ratio,
which suggests that poverty income ratio may serve as a
proxy for socioeconomic status, even if it is a relatively
poor indicator. However, the question of whether race/
ethnicity is a proxy for socioeconomic status remains and
has been actively debated in the literature. Race is clearly a
social rather than a biologic or physiologic variable (39),
and data show that socioeconomic status accounts for many
of the observed disparities in health across racial groups
(40). In the current study, poverty income ratio differed
significantly by race/ethnicity, so we tried to control for it
in the analysis. However, if poverty income ratio is not a
good indicator of socioeconomic status, controlling for it
may not have totally eliminated the effect of socioeco-
nomic status.
It has also been observed that ethnic and racial differences
persist even after socioeconomic status has been accounted
for (40). The ethnic differences in these data may reflect the
increased risk of diabetes among US minority groups, a
finding in line with other reports that most children with type
2 diabetes are from minority populations (16­18).
Our findings had some design and measurement limita-
tions. Data obtained from NHANES III are cross-sectional
and thus limit our ability to draw conclusions about causal
factors; further longitudinal studies are warranted. In this
study, poverty income ratio, an imperfect measure of socio-
economic status, was used. A combination of variables is
likely to reflect socioeconomic status more effectively.
Furthermore, using BMI as a measure of adiposity to
compare children across various age and racial/ethnic groups
might not be optimal, since racial disparity in adiposity is
likely to be linked to pubertal maturation (41).
NHANES III was a comprehensive national survey that
collected data on a wide range of variables. The survey, by
design, oversampled African Americans and Mexican
Americans, thereby including large numbers of minority
children. NHANES III provided the first representative data

need to collect longitudinal data to further understand the
utility of HbA1c among youth and its relation to type 2
