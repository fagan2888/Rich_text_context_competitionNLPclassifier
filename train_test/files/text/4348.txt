Abstract
We use administrative data from Wisconsin to determine the fraction of new Medicaid enrollees who have private health
insurance at the time of enrollment in the program. Through the linkage of several administrative data sources not previously
used for research, we are able to observe coverage status directly for a large fraction of enrollees and indirectly for the
remainder. We provide strict bounds for the percentages in each status and find that the percentage of new enrollees with
private insurance coverage at the time of enrollment lies between 16 percent and 29 percent, and the percentage that
dropped private coverage in favor of public insurance lies between 4 percent and 18 percent. Our point estimates indicate
that, among all new enrollees, 21 percent had private health insurance at the time of enrollment and that 10 percent dropped
this coverage. Our results show substantially lower rates than previous studies of crowd-out following public health insurance
expansions and significant rates of dual coverage, whereby new enrollees into public insurance retain their previously held
private insurance coverage.

Introduction
In this study, we determine the fraction of new Medicaid
enrollees who have private health insurance at the time of
enrollment in the program and, of those, the fraction that
dropped their private coverage. This study is, to our knowl-
edge, the first to use administrative data to estimate the
movement between private and public insurance programs.
Our findings also update the understanding of these move-
ments in the context of a private insurance environment that
differs substantially from that of a decade ago--in particu-
lar, one that today requires higher participant cost-sharing in
the form of premiums, deductibles, and co-payments (Kaiser
Family Foundation [KFF] 2011). In addition, we identify a
subpopulation of new enrollees into public insurance pro-
grams that simultaneously held private coverage for at least
six months following enrollment, a phenomenon that has
received relatively little attention in the literature.
An understanding of the movement between private and
public insurance programs is particularly important in today's
policy environment. The implementation of the Affordable
CareAct (ACA), including Medicaid expansions and premium
and cost-sharing subsidies for private, exchange-based health
insurance, has heighted concerns about declines in employer-
sponsored coverage. As of January 2013, Wisconsin was
among eight states with income eligibility thresholds for par-
ents with dependent children already in place that exceed the
ACA's 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) threshold
for Medicaid eligibility. An additional fifteen states had estab-
lished other programs for non-disabled childless adults (KFF
2013). As a result, concern about crowd-out goes beyond the
migration from employer-sponsored insurance to Medicaid, as
these states must decide whether to retain expanded coverage

for adults or to reduce eligibility to the 133 percent of FPL
threshold, and thereby allow a greater fraction of adults to
become eligible for federal subsidies of exchange-based pri-
vate coverage (State Health ReformAssistance Network 2013).
Understanding the extent to which new enrollees overlap
private coverage with public coverage allows for a more
nuanced assessment of the prior reported crowd-out rates and
may generate policy considerations about the degree to
which such dual coverage is desirable.
The linking of various state administrative data sources allow
us to accurately capture movements between private and public
coverage for individuals who enroll in public coverage, to deter-
mine the extent the enrollees into public coverage have and
maintain private coverage, and to observe job transitions that
may be associated with losses of coverage, none of which have
been previously possible. While our contribution is primarily
empirical in nature, we also develop a simple conceptualmodel
for understanding various approaches. This conceptual model
enables us to place our estimates within the literature and allows
for comparison with prior estimates of crowd-out.
The administrative data we use come from Wisconsin's
BadgerCare Plus (BC+) program, which covers children of
all income levels and parent or caretaker adults up to 200
percent of FPL. The data allow us to observe the universe of
enrollees in the state's public insurance program as well as
their family members. The size of our administrative data set
also allows us to examine subgroups, including groups
defined by income and geographic location.
Our strict upper bound for the percentage of new public
insurance enrollees with private health insurance at the time
of enrollment is 29 percent, with a strict lower bound of 16
percent. Not all of these enrollees dropped their private cover-
age. Our strict upper and lower bounds on the percentage that
dropped private coverage in favor of public insurance are 18
percent and 4 percent, respectively. We also provide point
estimates of these percentages, and we estimate that among
all new enrollees, 21 percent had private health insurance at
the time of enrollment and that 10 percent of all new enrollees
dropped this coverage. While these results are for the time
period after the expansion of Wisconsin's program (April
2008­May 2009), we find similar results for the pre-expansion
period (January 2006­January 2008) and for the expansion
rollout (February 2008­March 2008). Higher income groups
had higher rates of private insurance coverage at the time of
enrollment, as did residents of urban counties.
Background
Interest in the potential displacement of private insurance
coverage by public health programs increased with the expan-
sions of state Medicaid programs in the late 1980s and early
1990s. A robust literature emerged seeking to quantify the
magnitude of any such "crowd-out" effect. A comprehensive
overview of the crowd-out literature lies beyond the scope of
our work (for excellent reviews, see Gruber 2003; Davidson,
Blewett, and Call 2004; Blewett and Call 2007; Gruber and
Simon 2008); instead, we focus on situating the unique con-
tribution of our paper within this broader literature.
The approach we take is to use high-quality administrative
data to directly measure the prior and concurrent private
insurance coverage of new Medicaid enrollees. As will be
developed below in the conceptual model, the resulting mea-
sure is less expansive than the operationalization of crowd-
out in the majority of the related literature, as it does not
capture any potential effects that the availability of public
coverage may have on transitions between uninsured and pri-
vately insured states. The resulting implication is that our
parameter of interest should in theory be lower than the range
of crowd-out rates found in the existing literature. While this
range is vast and remains the subject of vigorous debate, two
important benchmarks are frequently cited: (1) the (approxi-
mate) 50 percent estimate from the seminal Cutler and Gruber
(1996) paper covering the Medicaid expansions of the late
1980s and early 1990s, and (2) the 25­50 percent range
arrived at in an influential review of the Children's Health
Insurance Program (CHIP) era expansions by the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO; 2007).
Thorpe and Florence (1999) authored the one existing
study that estimates a parameter similar to ours; using chil-
dren participating in the 1989­1994 rounds of the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth, they found that across the
study years, between 36 and 54 percent of new Medicaid
enrollees had private coverage at some point in the past year.
After subtracting out children whose coverage change likely
resulted from parental job loss, they estimated that approxi-
mately 16 percent of children had access to private insurance
at the time of Medicaid enrollment. Our work extends this
analysis in several important ways. First, we are able to
include adults in our estimates of private­public insurance
transitions. Moreover, as discussed above, our results are
more reflective of the current employer-sponsored insurance
environment, which is characterized by higher member cost-
sharing relative to the study periods of Thorpe and Florence
and its contemporary articles.
Finally, and arguably most importantly, we estimate concur-
rent private insurance coverage held by new Medicaid enroll-
ees during their early tenure on the program. Understanding the
extent to which new Medicaid enrollees "overlap" public cov-
erage with private coverage is a key contribution to the larger
crowd-out literature, as the treatment of the overlap population
is an important driver of differences in estimates across previ-
ous studies. There is concern that the overlap arises from a
measurement issue: either a reporting error on the part of sur-
vey recipients or an issue of timing (those who moved from one
source of coverage to the other report having both). Moreover,
concurrent with the implementation of eligibility expansions,
Medicaid and CHIP agencies increased their use of private
administrators for public-managed care programs, which likely
resulted in beneficiary confusion regarding type of coverage
held (see LoSasso and Buchmueller 2004 for a careful
Dague et al. 3
discussion of the resulting measurement error implications).
Critically, it is impossible to parse true coverage overlap from
measurement error in household survey data, a key limitation
of the existing literature. Directly measuring coverage with
administrative data greatly (if not entirely) reduces the possibil-
ity that coverage overlap reflects measurement error as opposed
to a genuine phenomenon.
Policy Context: BadgerCare Plus
Wisconsin's BC+ program was launched in February of 2008
and expanded upon Wisconsin's existing CHIP and Medicaid
program. With the expansion, BC+ covered parents and care-
taker adults with family incomes up to 200 percent FPL.
Adults with family incomes greater than 150 percent FPL
were charged sliding-scale premiums (premiums start at $10
and are capped at 5 percent of family income).
Children of all incomes were eligible for BC+, though for
both adults and children with incomes above 150 percent FPL,
eligibility depended on not having access to affordable and
qualified private insurance. Families of enrolled children with
incomes greater than 200 percent FPL were also charged slid-
ing-scale premiums, provided a more limited set of covered
services, andcharged co-payments on non-preventive services.
The families of children with incomes greater than 300 percent
FPL were required to pay the full cost of coverage, which
amounted to approximately $100 per month in 2008.
Under BC+, applicants with incomes over 150 percent
FPL were subject to anti-crowd-out provisions. With good-
cause exceptions, these individuals faced a three-month
waiting period for dropped coverage and cannot have been
offered employer-sponsored insurance during the previous
twelve months.
Method
The methodological approach we take in this article is to use
a set of high-quality linked administrative data sets with
information on a large number of individuals and their fami-
lies to measure the percentage of new enrollees that were
previously uninsured. For a large proportion, we can mea-
sure this percentage directly; for the remainder, we can both
bound and estimate it. In the following sections, we first
describe these data and how they were linked in detail. We
then describe the conceptual approach we use to measure
crowd-out, create bounds and estimates, and compare with
the literature.
Data and Sample Construction
For the analysis, we construct a longitudinal administrative
data set from four administrative databases:
CARES: Wisconsin's administra-tive enrollment and pro-
gram eligibility database,
TPL: Wisconsin's Third Party Liability database,
UI: Unemployment Insurance program quarterly wage
records, and
DOL: U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) database of all
self-insured firms.
Table 1 provides an overview of these data sets, including
the level and frequency of observation, how they are linked,
and the purpose of their usage.
The main data source is an administrative enrollment
database, CARES, from the state of Wisconsin's Medicaid
and CHIP programs, which was provided to us by agreement
with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The unit
of observation in this data set is an individual-month begin-
ning in the first month that individual enrolled in BC+
between January 2006 and May 2009.1 For some of the anal-
ysis, we use data from other case members; a case includes
all individuals associated with eligibility determination (gen-
erally, everyone in the applicant's household). Over this time
period, we have monthly enrollment data for a total of
1,392,185 enrollees in 433,525 unique cases. CARES also

contains demographic and income information, including
age, sex, ethnicity, citizenship, educational attainment, and
sources as well as amount of household income. From the
income data, we are able to observe whether the main source
of income for a case is self-employment income.
The second data source is the TPL database. TPL is an
individual-level database that identifies all enrollees in state
health insurance programs who are covered by a private
health insurance plan. This database, while an excellent
resource for our study, is limited in two ways. First, the data-
base does not contain individuals who are covered by health
insurance provided by a self-funded employer (whose poli-
cies are not subject to state regulation and therefore cannot
be compelled to provide information to the TPL database).
Second, these data are available for each month in which an
individual is enrolled in BC+ but do not contain information
on the health insurance coverage of individuals in months
prior to enrollment or following disenrollment. The database
does identify individuals covered by fully insured employers
as well as those with plans purchased in the non-group mar-
ket. Those enrollees who do not have insurance according to
the TPL database either do not have any source of private
insurance or have health insurance through a self-funded
employer. We match BC+ enrollees to the TPL database
using Social Security Numbers (SSNs).
The third data source, UI, is the state's records of employ-
ers' quarterly wage reports, which are required by the
Unemployment Insurance program. The wage reports
include the employee's SSN and quarterly wages and the
employer's Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)
and industry classification code from 2005 to 2009. Only
employers not subject to unemployment insurance laws are
exempt from reporting.2 Our primary purpose in matching
our enrollees to UI is to obtain the FEIN of their employers
and of the employers of their family members, which we
then use to identify those with self-insured employers.
Because employers who are exempt from UI reporting (such
as independent contractors) are unlikely to provide a self-
funded health insurance plan, we are not concerned about
their absence from the UI database. We match all BC+
enrollees and their case members to the UI data by SSN.
Because the enrollment data are monthly, we assign a person
to a firm for each month in the quarter in which we observe
them in UI. Those who are observed at multiple firms are
assigned the FEIN of the employer from which they had the
highest earnings.
We also use the longitudinal nature of the UI data to iden-
tify cases with a worker who had a job loss around the time
of enrollment, as the UI data are available for all workers in
CARES both prior to and post-enrollment. We define a job
loss at the time of enrollment as going from having a UI job
match from any firm in the quarter of enrollment in BC+ to
having no job match from any firm in the following quarter.
The final administrative data source we use is from the
DOL, obtained through a Freedom of InformationAct request,
to determine whether a BC+ enrollee's or case member's
employer offers a self-funded plan. The DOL data represent
the universe of employers within the United States from 2003
to 2007 that self-insured for health, life, and disability and
related insurance plans. These data are used to administer the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and are
part of the reporting requirements of self-insured firms to the
Internal Revenue Service. The DOL data are matched by
FEIN to all enrollees that were successfully matched to UI.3
Means of enrollee characteristics are reported in Table 2.
Notably, the youngest child in the family is under six for
about 60 percent of our sample. The vast majority of the
sample consists of cases under 150 percent FPL; this is
because much of the new enrollment in this expansion
occurred in populations that were income-eligible even prior
to reform (Herd et al. 2013; Leininger et al. 2011). Very few
households earn the majority of their income from self-
employment (the definition we use for self-employed).4
We augment our administrative data with the Current
Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement
(CPS-ASEC) when we impute employer-sponsored insur-
ance (ESI) coverage (described below). The 2007­2009
CPS-ASEC data have 11,418 Wisconsin respondents in total.
Our analytical sample consists of employed men and women
who are eighteen to sixty-four years old. We further limit our
sample to those living with at least one child under the age of
eighteen in the family to mimic the Medicaid eligibility cri-
teria in Wisconsin, yielding an analytical sample of 2,685
men and women.5 The health insurance question in the CPS-
ASEC asks about coverage sources in the previous year.
TableA1 of the appendix contains descriptive statistics of the
sample population from the CPS-ASEC.
Conceptual Framework
In this article, we aim to directly measure the percentages of
new public insurance enrollees that were previously unin-
sured and privately insured. This is a somewhat different
measure of crowd-out than that in previous studies. To facili-
tate comparison of our method with previous studies of
crowd-out and to clarify our approach, we develop a concep-
tual framework in the following discussion.
Crowd-out in response to an expansion in the income eli-
gibility threshold from I
0
to I
1
that occurs in year t is defined
as the net change in private insurance coverage between t
and t + 1 as a proportion of the net change in public insur-
ance coverage between t and t + 1 among the population
with incomes between I
0
and I
1
. Because private coverage
may change for reasons unrelated to the public insurance
expansion, the change in private coverage that would have
occurred in the counterfactual world of no public insurance
expansion (in practice operationalized as the experience of
comparison populations--which, depending on the study,
include across and/or within state individuals who experi-
enced no change in public insurance eligibility) must be
Dague et al. 5
subtracted from this amount. Thus, the crowd-out rate
resulting from an incremental expansion is given by

where T represents the actual expansion population (treat-
ment) and C represents the counterfactual expansion popula-
tion (control). By assumption, the counterfactual net change
in public insurance among the expansion population is zero.

private insurance into the gross flows between insurance

We can measure the first term on the right-hand side of
equation (3)--the number who transition from private insur-
ance to public insurance--directly in our administrative data.
The second term on the right-hand side of equation (3)--
the difference between the number who transition from pri-
vate insurance to uninsured in the expansion and
counterfactual states--is of ambiguous sign. Some people
who would have moved from private to uninsured will now
be able to move from private to public, which would tend to
make this term negative. However, the expansion may lead

some employers to drop coverage for eligible employees,
who then may choose not to enroll in public insurance, which
would tend to make this term positive. We believe that this
latter effect is likely smaller than the former effect. This term
cannot be measured using administrative data on enrollment
as it does not involve enrollees in public insurance
programs.
The final term on the right-hand side of equation (3)--
the difference between the number who transition from
uninsured to private insurance in the expansion and counter-
factual states--is if anything negative but probably small
(Cutler and Gruber 1996; Shore-Sheppard, Buchmueller, and
Jensen 2000; Marquis and Long 2003). Some employers
might have added health insurance coverage (reducing the
number of uninsured) but choose not to do so once public
health insurance is expanded.
Thus, the direct measure of the number of people who
transition from private to public insurance in response to the
public insurance (which is what we measure in this article) is
closely related to what would appear in the numerator of an
incremental crowd-out rate. It is exactly equal to the numera-
tor of the incremental crowd-out rate if the rates of transition
between private insurance coverage and being uninsured are
unaffected by the public insurance expansion.
The denominator of the crowd-out rate is the net increase
in public insurance coverage. This, too, can be decomposed
into flows into and out of public insurance:

We can use administrative data to measure the gross flows
into public insurance coverage from being uninsured and
from having private insurance coverage (the first two terms).
Thus, the difference between the sum of the two quantities
that we measure and the denominator of the crowd-out rate is
the difference between gross enrollment and net enrollment
into public insurance.
Empirical Analysis
The main focus of our analysis is to find the percentage of
new enrollees in public insurance that had private insurance
coverage at the time of enrollment. This quantity is closely
related to previously used measures of crowd-out, as dis-
cussed in the previous section. Here, we discuss our methods
for obtaining strict bounds for and point estimates of this per-
centage. Figure 1 serves as a guide to the analysis.
The first step is to identify those new BC+ enrollees that
had either private non-group insurance or ESI from a fully
insured firm at the time of enrollment. We do this by deter-
mining whether an enrollee was covered by an insurance
plan in TPL in the enrollment month. Any enrollee without a
TPL match does not have non-group insurance or insurance
from a fully insured firm in that month.
The second step is to identify new BC+ enrollees with
ESI from a self-insured firm. We do this by, first, finding
enrollees who themselves are or have a case member who is
employed at a firm with a self-funded plan by using the
UI-DOL match. We assume that it is not possible to have ESI
from a self-insured firm without at least one family member
being employed at a self-insured firm. Unlike the TPL match,
however, this match on its own does not tell us whether a
particular enrollee was actually covered by ESI from a

self-insured firm as not all workers at a self-insured firm will
be eligible for coverage. Some employees at firms that offer
health insurance are themselves not eligible for health insur-
ance either because they work part-time, are in occupations
that are not covered, or have not been at the firm for a suffi-
cient period of time. For example, Farber and Levy (2000)
report that in 1997, only 91 percent of workers in firms that
offered health insurance were eligible for coverage. The
majority of the ineligible were part-time workers.
We use two alternative methods to address this missing
information: (1) a strict bounds approach (Manski 1995) that
uses only the administrative data and (2) a point estimate that
imputes this information using survey data.
The strict bounds approach makes conservative assumptions
on the probability of an enrollee having ESI insurance coverage
conditional on a case member being employed at a self-insured
firm. In it, we obtain strict upper bounds by assuming that 100
percent of enrollees who are or who have a family member
employed at a self-insured firm have ESI coverage. We obtain
strict lower bounds by assuming that none of these enrollees
have ESI coverage. This method provides strict bounds because
it encompasses the minimum and the maximum possible take-
up of coverage by workers at self-insured firms.
We calculate the point estimate of the percentage of BC+
enrollees with a case member employed by a self-insured firm
that were covered by that plan by first identifying those with
the potential for this type of coverage using the UI-DOL data
as described above. Second, we estimate the probability of
their enrollment in ESI using the results of a model estimated
from survey data. In particular, we estimate a probit model
where the dependent variable is an indicator for ESI coverage
of the highest earning worker and the independent variables
are various individual and family characteristics. We are
restricted in using only those variables that appear both in the
survey data and in our administrative data. The means of these
variables in the CPS are listed in TableA1 of the appendix. We
use the 2007­2009 CPS-ASEC to estimate the probit model
and calculate the predicted probabilities that the relevant case
members will have ESI. We use three years of the CPS-ASEC
following Census Bureau guidelines for obtaining reliable
state-level estimates. We use the estimated coefficients from
the probit model to predict the probability of ESI coverage for
each new enrollee with a case member who is employed at a
self-insured firm. We use the average predicted probability as
the conditional probability for the relevant subgroup. We mul-
tiply this estimate of the conditional probability by the number
of enrollees to obtain the point estimate. Further details of the
model and results are reported in the appendix.
We assume any enrollee with neither a TPL match nor a
case member with a DOL match is uninsured at the time of
enrollment. In addition, we assume any enrollee with a job
loss is uninsured at the time of enrollment regardless of TPL
or DOL status.6
If all those with private health insurance at the time of
enrollment in public programs dropped that coverage imme-
diately, the analysis would end here. However, it is possible
that some BC+ enrollees who have private insurance at the
time of enrollment maintain their private coverage. This
possibility has been underexplored in the literature to date.
Therefore, the third step in our analysis is to determine the
percentage of enrollees that do drop their private coverage.
Individuals who do not drop their private insurance coverage
in favor of public coverage have not substituted public cov-
erage for private coverage, and thus we do not include them
in our estimates of crowd-out. In such cases of dual cover-
age, BC+ is the secondary payer.
To determine the percentage of enrollees that had private
coverage at the time of enrollment but subsequently dropped
that coverage, we once again use the TPL database that iden-
tifies all BC+ enrollees with either private non-group cover-
age or ESI coverage from a fully insured firm. We look six
months post-enrollment. We count those individuals who
had coverage at the time of enrollment (month 1) but did not
have it in any of the following six months (months 2­7) and
were still enrolled in BC+ as having dropped their private
coverage. In the case of BC+ enrollment spells shorter than 7
months, those that keep their private coverage for the entire
enrollment spell are considered to not have dropped private
coverage and those who drop private coverage prior to disen-
rollment are counted as having dropped private coverage.
We cannot directly observe the dropping of insurance
coverage among those with coverage from a self-insured
firm. When computing our strict lower and upper bounds,
we alternatively assume that all of these enrollees or that
none of these enrollees drop this coverage, as in our descrip-
tion of the upper and lower bounds above.
Results
This section, first, presents our estimates, based on adminis-
trative data, of the percentage of new Medicaid enrollees
who have private health insurance at the time of enrollment
in the program and, second, reports the fraction that dropped
their private coverage. We organize results into three time
periods--a period prior to the launch of BC+ (January
2006­January 2008), an initial expansion period (February
and March 2008), and a post-expansion period (April
2008­November 2009). We separately consider the initial
expansion period because of an auto-enrollment procedure
and initial large jump in enrollment that occurred simultane-
ously with program launch. In addition, we report results for
multiple income categories (above and below 150 percent
FPL, 150­200 percent FPL, 200­300 percent FPL, and
above 300 percent FPL) and residents of rural and urban
counties. We do not report separate results for adults and
children, as they differ little from one another.
Percentage of Enrollees with Private Coverage at
Enrollment
Table 3 includes a summary of our calculations of the strict
bounds for the percentage of newly enrolled individuals with
8 INQUIRY
private health insurance at the time they enrolled in BC+. We
find a lower bound of 13.6 percent on the percentage of
enrollees with private health insurance at the time of enroll-
ment prior to the program expansion. As described above,
this lower bound assumes that no enrollees who did not have
non-group or ESI from a fully insured employer (based on
TPL) and either themselves worked or had a family member
who worked at a self-insured firm were covered by that
firm's insurance plan. The upper bound of 26.9 percent alter-
nately assumes that 100 percent of these enrollees were
enrolled in a self-insured plan.
We next consider the initial expansion period. Relative to
the pre-expansion period, both upper and lower bounds are
roughly 15 percentage points higher, at [29.1%, 41.7%]. This
higher rate of private insurance coverage at the time of enroll-
ment is mostly due to higher prevalence of private coverage
among individuals who were auto-enrolled into BC+ in
February 2008, although we also find slightly higher than
average percentages with private health insurance among
non-auto enrollees in February and March 2008.7
In the post-expansion period (April 2008­November
2008), our lower bound is 16.0 percent of the percentage of
new enrollees with private health insurance at the time of
enrollment, and our upper bound is 28.7 percent.
Again, lower and upper bounds are calculated under very
conservative assumptions, given that we do not know
whether a worker is eligible for ESI from their employer.
However, despite making such conservative assumptions,
our upper bounds are below many estimates of crowd-out in
the existing literature.
Similarly, our strict lower bound is above some of the
lower estimates of crowd-out in the existing literature. But,
as we will show below, a significant portion of enrollees
maintain their private coverage for at least six months fol-
lowing enrollment into BC+.
Figure 2 shows the monthly number of new enrollees,
from February 2006 to June 2009. It also shows the number
of new enrollees who were matched to the TPL data (and thus
had private insurance from a non-group plan or from a fully
insured employer-sponsored plan) but did not experience a
job loss according to the UI data, and the number who were
matched to either TPL or DOL (indicating the additional pos-
sibility of having coverage from a self-insured firm) and had
no job loss. With the exception of February 2008, the number
of enrollees in each category is fairly steady from month to
month, with a slight upward trend in enrollment over the time
period.
Figure 3 illustrates the strict upper and lower bounds of
the percentage of new enrollees with private insurance cov-
erage at the time of enrollment over time. The strict upper
and lower bounds on this percentage are fairly steady within
time periods, are notably higher in February 2008, and are
slightly higher in the post-reform period.
As an alternative to estimating strict bounds, we use sur-
vey data to estimate the probability of ESI coverage and
apply those estimates to impute this probability among
enrollees who are employed or who have a family member
employed at a self-insured firm. As described above, we use
the CPS to predict the probability of a worker having private
health insurance conditional upon his or her employment sta-
tus and demographic characteristics. The model is further
described in the appendix and its estimated parameters are
reported in Table A2 of the appendix. When these parameters
are applied to our administrative data, we estimate that on
average, 42 percent of enrollees who work for or who have a
family member who works for a firm with a self-funded
insurance plan are covered by ESI.
Using this method, we then estimate the percentage of
new enrollees with private insurance at the time of enroll-
ment to be 19.3 percent (95 percent CI [18.0%, 20.1%])8

during the pre-expansion period. During the initial program
expansion period, we estimate this percentage to be 34.4 per-
cent (95 percent CI [33.1%, 35.7%]). We estimate that in the
post-BC+ expansion period, 21.2 percent (95 percent CI
[20.0%, 22.3%]) of all enrollees had private insurance cover-
age at the time of enrollment. These results are summarized
in Table 3.
Table 3 also presents the upper bounds, lower bounds, and
point estimates stratified by income as a percentage of FPL
by whether the county of residence was urban (defined as
Milwaukee, Waukesha, and Dane counties) or rural (all other
Wisconsin counties). Higher family income (as a percentage
of FPL) was generally associated with a higher percentage of
enrollees having private insurance at the time of enrollment.
Enrollees living in urban as opposed to rural counties were
slightly more likely to have private insurance.
Because our estimates rely on two very different sources
of data--the TPL data for those with private coverage
through non-group insurance or fully insured ESI and the
DOL data for those potentially with coverage through self-
funded plans--we separate the sources of the estimates into
these two components in Table 4 to clarify these elements.
For example, of the 21.2 percent of new enrollees between
April 2008 and May 2009 that we estimate to have private
health insurance at the time of enrollment, 16.0 percentage
points represent those with coverage from a non-group plan
or fully insured ESI (TPL) and 5.2 percentage points is esti-
mated to come from coverage from a self-insured firm
(DOL). Of the upper bound of 28.7 percent, 16.0 percent
comes from TPL and 12.7 percent from DOL.
We also calculated these percentages separately for chil-
dren and adults, although we do not report them because they
did not appreciably differ from one another. This is perhaps
not surprising because the adults in this study are parents (or
caretaker relatives), and children tend to have the same
sources of private coverage as their parents.

Percentage of Enrollees That Dropped
Private Coverage
We report our upper bound, lower bound, and point estimates
of the percentage of enrollees who had private coverage at
the time of enrollment and subsequently dropped that cover-
age in Table 5.
During the pre-expansion period, 3.1 percent of new
enrollees had dropped their private insurance coverage within
six months after their enrollment month according to our TPL
data match. This percentage is the lower bound. If, in addi-
tion, all those employed at DOL firms had private coverage
and dropped that coverage, a total of 16.4 percent of new
enrollees would have dropped their private insurance cover-
age. This percentage is the upper bound.
The upper and lower bounds for the expansion period are
slightly higher. For February­March 2008, we find a lower
bound of 5.4 percent and an upper bound of 18.1 percent.
During the April 2008 to May 2009 post-expansion period,
we find a lower bound of 4.7 percent and an upper bound of
17.4 percent.
Figure 4 illustrates the strict upper and lower bounds of
the percentage of new enrollees that dropped private insur-
ance coverage within six months of enrollment over time.
The strict upper and lower bounds on this percentage are
fairly steady across all time periods and are substantially
lower than the bounds on the percentage with private insur-
ance at the time of enrollment shown in Figure 3.
If we predict the number of enrollees that have insurance
from a self-insured firm using survey data (as described
above) and assume that none of them drop this coverage, we
estimate that in the pre-expansion period, 8.9 percent (95
percent CI [7.6%, 10.2%]) of enrollees dropped coverage
soon after enrollment in BC+. This percentage was only
slightly higher in the transitional period at 10.7 percent (95
percent CI [9.7%, 11.8%]). During the post-expansion
period, we estimate that only 9.9 percent (95 percent CI
[8.8%, 11.1%]) of new enrollees dropped private coverage
within seven months of their enrollment date.
As with the estimates of the percentage of enrollees with
private coverage at the time of enrollment, the estimates of
the percentage that dropped private coverage are higher for
those individuals in families with higher incomes as a per-
centage of FPL and are slightly higher for those enrollees
who reside in urban counties.
Discussion
Wisconsin's high-quality administrative data systems that
allow linkages between databases tracking public insurance
enrollment, private insurance coverage, and employment
allows for precise measurement of the fraction of Medicaid
enrollees that had private coverage at the time of enrollment
and of the fraction that dropped this coverage. These longitu-
dinal administrative data allow for the calculation of a mea-
sure of crowd-out that is similar to that measured in the
previous literature. Our measure can help inform state and
federal policymakers of the likely impacts of state-level pub-
lic insurance coverage expansions on participation in private
insurance markets.
Our findings suggest that recent expansions toWisconsin's
Medicaid/CHIP program did not lead to a substantial reduc-
tion in private insurance coverage. Although a modest per-
centage--between 16.0 percent and 28.7 percent--of new

enrollees had private coverage at the time of enrollment,
only between 4.7 percent and 17.4 percent dropped this cov-
erage with the remainder being dual covered.
Our estimates of crowd-out are relatively low compared
with many estimates of crowd-out from Medicaid and CHIP
expansions, which tend to be in the 25­50 percent range
(CBO 2007). Moreover, they are low given that, at the time,
Wisconsin policy stipulated that individuals were eligible
for BC+ regardless of whether they had access to employer-
sponsored insurance if either their family incomes were
below 150 percent FPL or if they were required to pay more
than 20 percent of an ESI premium. The large increase in
public coverage in response to the BC+ expansion, there-
fore, substantially reduced the ranks of the uninsured or
added secondary coverage to many families with private
coverage.
Our estimates also indicate the existence of a relatively
unexamined phenomenon--public insurance enrollees who
hold both private and public coverage. A 2006 Government
Accountability Office (GAO) report that uses the 2002­2004
CPS data to study this issue finds that, nationally, 13 percent
of those who have Medicaid for the entire year also had pri-
vate coverage at some point during that year, which is consis-
tent with our findings (GAO 2006). We have no direct
evidence on what motivates enrollees to hold private and
public coverage simultaneously, although since Medicaid
acts as a secondary payer in such cases, it may cover and
expand scope of services, reduce out-of-pocket costs to the
enrollees, or allow them to remain with a current provider.
While allowing dual coverage may seem unusual, it is not
unique to Wisconsin. In 2010, we reviewed the websites for
each state's Medicaid program to determine which states allow

their family and child program applicants to have dual cover-
age. Most states' websites provided sufficient evidence to
determine their dual coverage policy. When this was not the
case, we called the state's CHIP program office directly for
further information. Nine states allowed some sort of dual
coverage with their CHIP program: Alaska, Idaho, Indiana,
Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon, South Dakota, and
Wisconsin. These dual coverage programs range in breadth
from allowing children/families with private insurance to be
dually covered, with income restrictions (Alaska, Idaho,
Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, South Dakota, and Wisconsin), to
only allowing dual coverage in cases of underinsurance, again
with income restrictions (Michigan and Oregon). We were
unable to determine the policy toward dual coverage in five
states (D.C., Hawaii, Maine, North Carolina, and Washington).
These states'websites were unclear on the subject of dual cov-
erage and attempts to get more information by phone were
unsuccessful. Thirty-seven states do not allow any sort of dual
coverage. That is, individuals must not have private coverage
under any circumstances to be eligible for these programs.
A limitation of our study, and one shared by the previous
literature, is that we are unable to observe directly whether
the individuals in our administrative data discontinue cover-
age voluntarily or whether their employers cease to offer it.
In Wisconsin, there have been slight trends toward reduced
employer offering and reduced employee take-up of
employer-sponsored health insurance (State Health Access
Data Assistance Center 2013).
We do not claim to capture all dimensions in which public
coverage can substitute for private coverage. Specifically,
we focus on those individuals who actually enroll in Medicaid
and had private insurance at the time of enrollment. If poten-
tial enrollees are able to use Medicaid as an implicit insur-
ance plan, available when needed but not necessary to
maintain active enrollment, then we understate the degree of
substitution. Most of our sample, however, would have no
eligibility incentive to drop private coverage and go unin-
sured prior to taking up Medicaid given that BC+ premium
cost-sharing does not apply to adults below 150 percent FPL
and children below 200 percent FPL.
Finally, the recession that began in late 2007 and wors-
ened throughout 2008 complicates the interpretation of the
transition and post-period results. Employers could have
been making changes to benefits during this time that affected
the relative desirability of public and private insurance.
Despite these limitations, our study accurately captures
the actual number of new Medicaid enrollees who substi-
tute public coverage for private insurance and the number
of new enrollees that were previously uninsured. Our study
shows that using administrative data can yield credible esti-
mates of the fraction of public health insurance program
enrollees that have access to private health insurance.
Moreover, it suggests that increases in public coverage in
the post-CHIP era do not necessarily incur widespread sub-
stitution of public coverage for private coverage.
Appendix
We report summary statistics for our CPS sample in TableA1.
We use this data to estimate a probit model of health insur-
ance coverage. The predictors in the probit models include
sex, age, geographic location, age of the youngest child in the
family, educational level, self-employment status, occupa-
tional industry, firm size, earnings, and FPL. See Table A1 of
the appendix for descriptive statistics on the CPS sample.
Except for FPL and age of the youngest child, all variables
are employment or demographic characteristics of the highest
earner in a family. These variables were selected and con-
structed to match with the available information in adminis-
trative data. The age of the highest earner is coded into 18­34,
35­54, and older than 54 years (reference group). The educa-
tional level of the highest earner is coded into less than high
school (reference group), high school graduation or general
education development test (GED) but no college education,
and at least one year of college education. The size of the
employer is coded into a dichotomous variable, with less than
100 as the reference group. The yearly earnings of the highest
earner are coded into less than $10,000; $10,000­$14,999;
$15,000­$19,999; $20,000­$29,999; and more than $30,000
(reference). Earnings are inflated to 2009 dollars using the
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).

Observations 2,685
Note. Standard errors in parentheses. This table shows the marginal
effects from the probit model used to predict the probability of private
insurance over the administrative data. The model was estimated
with data from the 2007­2010 CPS. Details of sample and variable
construction are available in the text. FPL = federal poverty level; CPS =
Current Population Surveys.
*p < .05. **p < .01.
FPL is divided into 150 percent and less (reference), 151­200
percent, 201­300 percent, and greater than 300 percent.
We use two indicators to identify the residential counties
that are more diverse and highly urbanized: living in Dane
county (mainly Madison) and living in Milwaukee or
Waukesha counties. We first intended to separate urban and
rural residential areas. Although CPS contains geographic
information sufficient for our purpose, the administrative
data only have residential county. We thus created two indi-
cators of urban counties to match both data sets. We cannot
separate Milwaukee from Waukesha in the CPS data.
We create a dichotomous indicator for the goods-producing
industries, which were identified as agriculture/forestry,
mining, construction, and manufacturing industries in the
major industry code.Age of the youngest child is categorized
into being younger than six, six to twelve (reference), and
older than twelve. We also control for the survey year.
We use probit models to estimate the probability of having
private insurance among workers. Table A2 of the appendix
shows the marginal effects from the probit model. Because all
variables are binary, the table reports the marginal effects of
going from 0 to 1 for each. Our results suggest that residential
area, earnings, industry, firm size, educational level, and fam-
ily poverty levels predict the probability of having private
insurance well. The workers from smaller firms and workers
in non-goods producing industries are less likely to have
health insurance. Earning and FPL are positively associated
with having health insurance. The workers living in the two
largest metropolitan counties in Wisconsin are more likely to
have private insurance than those living in other areas. Self-
employment is negatively associated with private insurance.

Notes
1. We include only new enrollees; all observations in January 2006
are left-censored, so we cannot observe the start-date of their
spells. We exclude these censored observations from our analysis.
We use the panel nature of the data to look six months ahead at
private status, so although the data go through November 2009,
the last new spells we include are those beginning in May 2009.
2. In general, Wisconsin employers are subject to Unemployment
Insurance (UI) liability if they pay $1,500 or more in wages
in any calendar quarter or have full or part-time employees
working for them in twenty weeks or more during a calendar
year. Special rules apply for agriculture, non-profit firms, and
employers of domestic service workers.
3. A minor issue involves the usage of Federal Employer
Identification Numbers (FEINs) to link data from different
sources. FEINs are issued by the Internal Revenue Service
for payroll tax reporting. Although a FEIN is unique to a firm,
firms can have more than one FEIN if they have more than one
location or operate under different names. For single-unit firms
(which have only one establishment), there is a one-to-one
relationship between the firm and the FEIN. However, multi-
unit firms, such as chain stores, can have more than one FEIN,
although each establishment can be associated with only one
FEIN. Because the UI system sometimes cross-verifies data
with the Internal Revenue Service, we are confident that FEINs
used in the Department of Labor (DOL) and UI data are cor-
rectly matched. In addition, for a small sample of employers
14 INQUIRY
(including one retail chain, one company that owned several
chains in the same industry, and one major manufacturer), we
were able to directly verify that the FEINs that were submitted
to UI and DOL were identical and accurately represented who
owned the responsibility for the insurance offer.
4. Although employment information is available in CARES,
Wolfe et al. (2006) found it to be of very low quality relative to
UI information. Thus, we do not use employment information
from CARES.
5. We only consider those workers who were living in a fam-
ily (defined by Current Population Survey Annual Social and
Economic Supplement [CPS-ASEC]) in which at least one
relative child (i.e., under eighteen years old) was present.
Workers who were in families without any related child or who
were living alone with unrelated children were excluded from
our analysis. For multiple-family households, the workers who
were in unrelated subfamilies but had no related child in his or
her own family would not be included in our sample.
6. We recognize the possibility that obtaining public coverage
could induce individuals to reduce labor supply, which would
result in our classifying intentional exits as job losses. Existing
literature suggests that this is not a prevalent phenomenon (see,
for example, Strumpf 2011). A more likely potential phenom-
enon is a switch to self-employment induced by receiving public
coverage that results in the lack of a longitudinal match to the
UI data. This phenomenon would suggest that we are misclas-
sifying some intentional switches to self-employment as job
losses. However, it is debatable whether these switches should be
counted in the crowd-out figures, given that being "job locked"
in a position with health insurance coverage when one prefers
to be self-employed is widely considered to be welfare reducing
(see, for example, Madrian 1994 and Monheit and Cooper 1994).
7. For a more detailed description of the auto-enrollment process
that occurred in February 2008, please see DeLeire et al. (2012).
8. All reported confidence intervals for point estimates are 95
percent normal bootstrap confidence intervals from at least
three hundred replications. Percentile and bias-corrected con-
fidence intervals are very similar and are not reported here.
