ABSTRACT
Background: Periodontitis is ubiquitous and associated
with serological evidence of exposure to periodontal
organisms, systemic inflammation and vascular disease.
Dementia is a major public health problem likely related to
a complex interaction between genetics and diseases
associated with systemic inflammation, including dia-
betes, smoking and stroke.
Methods: To assess relationships between systemic
exposure to periodontal pathogens and cognitive test
outcomes, data were analysed from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III), a
nationally representative cross sectional observational
study among older adults. We included 2355 participants
>60 years who completed measures of cognition and
Poryphyromonas gingivalis IgG. Using SUDAAN, logistic
regression models examined the association of P
gingivalis IgG with cognitive test performance.
Results: Poor immediate verbal memory (,5/9 points)
was prevalent in 5.7% of patients, and 6.5% overall had
impaired delayed recall (,4/9); 22.1% had difficulty with
serial subtractions (,5/5 trials correct). Individuals with
the highest P gingivalis IgG (.119 ELISA Units (EU))
were more likely to have poor delayed verbal recall (OR
2.89, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.29) and impaired subtraction (OR
1.95, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.11) than those with the lowest
((57 EU), with dose­response relationships for both (p
trend, delayed memory = 0.045, subtraction = 0.04).
After adjusting for socioeconomic and vascular variables,
these relationships remained robust for the highest P
gingivalis IgG group (delayed verbal memory OR 3.01
(95% CI 1.06 to 8.53); subtraction OR 2.00 (95% CI 1.19
to 3.36)). In contrast, immediate verbal memory was not
significantly associated with P gingivalis.
Conclusion: A serological marker of periodontitis is
associated with impaired delayed memory and calcula-
tion. Further exploration of relationships between oral
health and cognition is warranted.
Oral health problems, including periodontal disease,
caries, edentulism and infrequent preventative care,
become more prevalent with increasing age.1 2
Periodontitis and caries are the two predominant
causes of tooth loss and reflect similar risk factors,
including inattention to care; periodontitis is more
common than caries among adults.3 4 Estimates of
adult prevalence of clinical periodontitis vary from
20% to greater than 80%,5 and differences in
prevalence estimates likely depend on clinical
markers used for disease definition.
Periodontitis is a chronic, potentially transmis-
sible oral biofilm infection.6 7 Exposure to period-
ontal pathogens is ubiquitous in older adults,8 with
a large proportion exposed by adolescence.9 A
systemic host response to periodontitis is evi-
denced by serum antibodies to common period-
ontal bacteria,8 such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (a
pathogen causally associated with periodontitis),6
plus elevations in serum inflammatory markers
interleukin 610 and C reactive protein.11 In addition
to epidemiological associations, treatment of per-
iodontal disease decreases serum levels of inter-
leukin 6 and C reactive protein.11
Epidemiological evidence supports an association
between stroke and serum antibody measures to P
gingivalis.12 P gingivalis is associated with acceler-
ated aortic atherogenesis13 and increased carotid
artery intimal­medial thickness.14 Risk factors for
stroke and dementia, including diabetes, obesity
and smoking, have a similar systemic inflamma-
tory profile to periodontitis15 16 and suggest that
they could play similar roles in a final common
pathway of atherogenesis related to systemic
inflammation.15
Despite the association of periodontitis with
stroke and shared risk factors between stroke and
dementia,17 to our knowledge, no epidemiological
studies have investigated periodontitis relative to
cognition. We hypothesised that periodontal dis-
ease is a risk factor for poor cognition. Thus we
investigated whether periodontitis, as defined by a
serological marker, is independently associated
with cognitive test performance in older adults in
a nationally representative US sample, before and
after controlling for potential socioeconomic and
vascular confounders.
METHODS
Source of data
The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES-III) was a cross
sectional nationwide health survey of the USA,
performed between 1988 and 1994 by the National
Center for Health Statistics. NHANES-III enrolled
33 994 persons aged 2 months and older using a
stratified multistage probability sampling design.
Inclusion criteria
During the second phase of enrolment (1991­1994),
9371 persons had serum analysis for immunoglobu-
lin levels of P gingivalis,18 with 2531 >60 years of age.
Of these, persons with both cognitive evaluations
and serum analysis for these pathogens (n = 2355)
were included in this analysis.
Study variables
Serum P gingivalis IgG was chosen for study to
capture evidence of systemic exposure to a

common periodontal disease causing pathogenic bacterium with
well described pathogenicity8 and associations with systemic
disease and stroke. Antibody measurements were reported in
ELISA units of IgG (EU). To examine for possible dose­response
relationships of P gingivalis and cognition, we created four
ranges of P gingivalis IgG based on the only known report
relating periodontitis severity to P gingivalis IgG.8 That report
from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC,
n = 1673) had similar demographics to the NHANES-III subjects
studied here and reported mean P gingivalis IgG for healthy
individuals of 53.8 EU (SD 9.1), mild periodontitis 60.9 EU (SD
8.4), moderate periodontitis 69.4 EU (SD 5.5) and severe
periodontitis 168.4 (SD 9.5) (p,0.0001, determined by non-
parametric rank scores from general linear models for overall
significance after having p,0.05 for the Hotelling T2 statistic for
multiple comparisons of 17 periodontal bacteria serum titres).8
To capture the relationship of increasing P gingivalis IgG
associated with increasing periodontitis severity, we used the
midpoint between each of these P gingivalis IgG means to create
cut-off points for four P gingivalis IgG groups: (57 EU
(referent), 58­65 EU, 66­119 EU and .119 EU (highest).
Three cognitive tests were measured in NHANES-III: an
immediate and delayed logical verbal memory test from the East
Boston Memory Test,19 a three word registration/memory task
(``apple,'' ``table'' and ``penny'') and five serial subtractions by
intervals of three. Consistent with previous NHANES-III
reports,20 21 a summary score of less than 4 out of a possible
9 points in total (0­6 points from paragraph/story memory,
plus 0­3 points from three word recall) was considered
impaired. For immediate memory (registration), again using a
summary score of logical memory and three word task, we
considered less than 5 out of 9 points (10th percentile) to be
impaired. For the test of serial subtractions, any miscalculation
during the five trials was considered impaired. We also initially
explored a clinical definition of periodontitis22 relative to
delayed memory but found no association (data not shown).
A comprehensive history was taken, including medical
history, medication use and self-reported sociodemographic
factors. Race­ethnicity included data from the three major
groups, as collected in the survey: non-Hispanic White, non-
Hispanic Black and Mexican­American. Annual individual
income was categorised into three groups: ($14 999,
$15 000­24 999 and .$25 000. Health insurance status was
defined by active health insurance within the last month
(private company, Medicare, Medicaid or military). Years of
education were categorised as ,12 years (less than high school
education), 12 years (equivalent to completion of high school)
and .12 years of (at least some education beyond high school).
Smoking status was specified as never, current or former
smokers.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined by history of
myocardial infarction or anginal symptoms (pain or discomfort
in the chest while walking uphill that abates with rest).
Congestive heart failure (CHF) was based on a history of a
physician informing the patient of CHF. Stroke was defined as a
self-reported history of stroke or if the subject had been
informed by a physician of stroke. Diabetes mellitus was
defined by self-report of diabetes; women with only a history of
gestational diabetes were not considered diabetic. Hypertension
was defined as present if the participant self-reported hyperten-
sion, used anti-hypertensive medications or had measured
systolic blood pressure .130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure
.85 mm Hg. This more liberal assessment of blood pressure is
consistent with that of the metabolic syndrome23 and was used
in order to minimise the potential effect of this possible
confounder.
Statistical methods
Descriptive statistics for selected characteristics and prevalence
of the outcomes of interest were estimated. To determine
significance of differences, t tests for comparison of means of
continuous variables were used. To determine the strength of
the association between P gingivalis IgG and cognitive test
performance before and after controlling for selected covariates,
logistic regression models were fitted. All data management was
done using SAS v9.1 (SAS/STAT 9.1 User's Guide, 2004; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA). All analyses were

used in NHANES-III yielding unbiased standard error estimates.
RESULTS
Mean age of the study participants was 70.8 years (95% CI 70.0
to 71.6); 57% were women (table 1). Overall, the mean P
gingivalis IgG level was 117.2 EU (95% CI 103.6 to 131.1). Mean
P gingivalis IgG significantly differed by sex, race, income,
smoking history, dental health status, CAD and hypertension
(table 2).
Poor immediate verbal memory (registration) was prevalent
in 5.7% of patients, and overall 6.5% had impaired verbal
memory; 22.1% had some difficulty with serial subtractions.
Mean P gingivalis IgG was higher among those with impaired
performance for each of the three cognitive tests (table 3).
Immediate verbal memory (registration) was not significantly
associated with high P gingivalis IgG in any model (table 4). In
unadjusted models, individuals in the highest P gingivalis IgG
group (.119 EU) were more likely to have poor delayed verbal
memory (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.29) and impaired
subtraction (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.11) than those in the
lowest group ((57 EU), with apparent dose­response relation-
ships for both (p trend, delayed memory = 0.045; p trend,
subtraction = 0.04) (tables 5, 6).
We then explored potential effects on the relationship
between P gingivalis IgG and cognitive tests, initially by age,

sex and education, which did not appreciably affect the
relationship between P gingivalis IgG and delayed memory or
subtraction (model 1, tables 5, 6). Additionally adjusting for
other socioeconomic confounders (insurance status, race and
income) led to marked attenuation of the relationship between
the highest P gingivalis IgG group and delayed memory (OR
1.81, 95% CI 0.56 to 5.85, p trend = 0.45) but did not affect the
relationship with the subtraction test (model 2, tables 5, 6).
Finally, we explored a model additionally including potential
vascular confounders hypertension, CAD, CHF, diabetes melli-
tus, smoking and stroke. Inclusion of vascular variables
strengthened the relationship between the highest P gingivalis
IgG group and delayed verbal memory (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.06 to
8.53) but had minimal effect on the test of subtraction (OR
2.00, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.36). Taken together, these findings
suggest that vascular factors are a negative confounder in the
relationship of P gingivalis and delayed memory in a model
adjusting for socioeconomic factors. Moreover, neither vascular
nor socioeconomic factors played an appreciable role in the
relationship of P gingivalis IgG and subtraction test perfor-
mance.
We also explored potential effect modification of the relation-
ship between P gingivalis IgG and cognitive tests by age
(dichotomised at a median age of 72 years), stroke history and
race (given its apparent role as a confounder in the relationship
with delayed memory). None of these potential effect modifiers
were statistically significant in crude or fully adjusted models
for any of the cognitive tests (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We identified a cross sectional association between a serological
marker of a common periodontitis pathogen and poor cognitive
test performance in a large nationally representative sample.
Individuals with high levels of P gingivalis IgG had significantly
greater odds of impaired verbal memory and subtraction test
performance and this finding remained robust when adjusting
for potential sociodemographic and vascular confounders.
Furthermore, we identified a statistically significant dose­
response relationship between subtraction test performance
and increasing P gingivalis IgG and a similar but non-significant
trend regarding delayed verbal memory and P gingivalis IgG.
Given these findings, we performed post hoc analyses of A
actinomycetemcomitans IgG (the only other periodontal pathogen
evaluated in NHANES-III) and clinical periodontitis22 relative to
all cognitive test outcomes but found no relationship in any
models (data not shown), perhaps related to weak associations
of A actinomycetemcomitans with systemic disease12 and imprecise
clinical periodontal measurements in NHANES-III.24 Notably,
an NHANES-III study found that among those aged 20­
59 years, markers of periodontitis (gingival bleeding, loss of
periodontal attachment and tooth loss) were associated with
poor symbol digit substitution test and serial digit learning test
performance. However, these same individual clinical measures
of periodontitis were not associated with story recall in adjusted
models among those aged 70 years and older.25
These cross sectional analyses do not allow inferences
regarding the directionality of the association of cognition and
dental health. A relatively straightforward argument can be
made for cognitive impairment leading to poor dental health:
persons with impaired cognition could be inattentive to oral
hygiene or oral health maintenance as impairment in cognition
progresses.26 Conversely, worth considering is whether poor oral
health could contribute to subsequent cognitive impairment.
Although results presented here are preliminary and incon-
clusive, a growing body of evidence supports exploration of a
possible association between poor oral health and incident
dementia. Poor dentition, a late-life marker of earlier oral health
conditions such as periodontitis, is associated with both
prevalent cognitive impairment25 27 28 and incident dementia.29­31
In addition, at least one randomised trial demonstrated that more
intensive dental care was associated to a 1.5 point significantly
slower decline in Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination score
after 2 years.32
Despite association of stroke with periodontitis,17 33 stroke did
not appear to be a confounder or effect modifier in the
relationship between P gingivalis IgG and cognitive test
performance. This could reflect an imprecise assessment of
stroke based on self-report, or that the relationship between
stroke, periodontitis and memory is masked within a cross-
sectional study. Alternatively, periodontitis could be related to
cognition independent of clinical stroke. Similar to diabetes,
hypertension and smoking,34 periodontitis is associated with

impaired systemic arterial endothelial function,35 and the latter
has been associated with cerebral white matter hyperintensi-
ties,36 vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.37 38
Alternatively, systemic inflammation has been hypothesised
to directly influence expression of neurodegenerative disorders
such as Alzheimer's disease.39
This study has several limitations other than the constraints
of cross sectional analysis. Measurable socioeconomic covariates
provide a restricted scope of lifelong socioeconomic status and
periodontitis could be or lead, at least in part, to residual
confounder; indeed, low socioeconomic status is strongly
associated with periodontitis in NHANES-III.22 Moreover,
persons with low socioeconomic status may have low cognitive
reserve,40 or relatively worse memory test performance despite
similar brain pathology compared with other groups.
Available NHANES-III cognitive tests are another limitation.
The cognitive measurements reported here are crude assess-
ments of cognitive test performance and may reflect individual
or group differences in test understanding, rather than a true
assessment of cognition. The limited scope of these tests also
does not clearly inform a potential neuroanatomical basis for
impaired test performance, given likely overlapping cognitive
domains involved with each task. Furthermore, the precise
aetiology of impaired cognitive test performance cannot be
known from these data. Nonetheless, the components of the
outcome used here have been validated as rigorous tools for
screening memory in epidemiological studies.19
In an attempt to capture a dose­response relationship between
P gingivalis IgG and cognitive test performance, we created P
gingivalis IgG groups based on a report from another large
multicentre population based American study (ARIC),8 which
found a strong association between escalating levels of P gingivalis
IgG and clinical periodontitis severity. Use of this schema for
creating P gingivalis IgG groups appears plausible but requires
validation in other studies. Serum antibodies to periodontal
pathogens are strongly associated with worse states of oral health8
and remain persistently elevated despite clinical treatment.41
Taken together, these findings suggest that serum antibody levels
reflect chronic, intermittent exposures of clinical periodontitis,
but it is uncertain whether to state that a higher periodontal titre
implies higher burden of acute exposures, more recent exposure or
more intense response to periodontal pathogens.
Periodontitis is a lifelong, highly prevalent, chronic inflam-
matory disease associated with stroke, systemic inflammation
and endothelial dysfunction. Although our results are pre-
liminary, they suggest that further exploration of relationships
between oral health and cognition is warranted.
