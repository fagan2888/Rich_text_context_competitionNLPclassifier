Introduction
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly
prescribed for several acid-related disorders,1
such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
and peptic ulcer disease.2­5 These drugs are also
effective in treating ulcers associated with the use
of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and as prophylactic treatment for
patients on NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin.6­10
Recommended doses and duration of PPI treat-
ment vary by indications. Clinical guidelines
rarely recommend PPI treatment for more than
8­12 weeks.11,12 High-dose treatment is recom-
mended when initiating therapy for GORD and
peptic ulcer disease, while low-dose treatment is
generally regarded as a maintenance therapy for
recovering patients.12
PPIs are generally considered safe.13 However,
their use has been associated with increased risks
of adverse events, such as bone fractures,14 kidney
disease,15 microscopic colitis,16 and hypomagne-
semia.17 Use of PPIs has also been suggested to
cause changes in the composition of the intestinal

Abstract
Background: The use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) has grown worldwide, and there
are concerns about increased unsubstantiated long-term use. The aim of the study was to
describe the real-world use of PPIs over the past decade in an entire national population.
Methods: This was a nationwide population-based drug-utilization study. Patterns of
outpatient PPI use among adults in Iceland between 2003 and 2015 were investigated,
including annual incidence and prevalence, duration of use, and dose of tablet used (lower
versus higher), as well as the proportion of PPI use attributable to gastroprotection.
Results: We observed 1,372,790 prescription fills over the entire study period, of which 95%
were for higher-dose PPIs. Annual incidence remained stable across time (3.3­4.1 per 100
persons per year), while the annual prevalence increased from 8.5 per 100 persons to 15.5 per
100 persons. Prevalence increased with patient age and was higher among women than men.
Duration of treatment increased with patients' age (36% of users over 80 years remained on
treatment after 1 year compared with 13% of users aged 19­39 years), and was longer among
those initiating on a higher dose compared with a lower dose. The proportion of PPI users
concurrently using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decreased over the study period,
while the proportion concurrently using acetylsalicylic acid, oral anticoagulants, or platelet
inhibitors increased.
Conclusions: In this nationwide study, a considerable increase in overall outpatient use of
PPIs over a 13-year period was observed, particularly among older adults. Patients were
increasingly treated for longer durations than recommended by clinical guidelines and mainly
with higher doses.

microbiota, increasing the risk of Clostridium dif-
ficile infection18 and chronic liver disease.19
Although PPIs have been shown to minimize
NSAID-related adverse effects in the stomach,
recent evidence suggests that PPIs might cause
changes in the composition of the small intestinal
microbiota, augmenting unwanted adverse effects
of NSAIDs in the small intestines.20 Furthermore,
discontinuation of PPI treatment has been linked
to acid hypersecretion21 and the development of
dyspeptic symptoms in healthy volunteers.22
PPIs have had undisputed effects on the treatment
of symptoms related to excessive acid secretion,
but concerns are growing about inappropriate
indications and potential overuse, both within hos-
pitals and in the primary-care setting.23­26 These
concerns are compounded by observations of
increased long-term use especially in elderly popu-
lations,27­29 where overprescribing has been associ-
ated with increased morbidity and mortality.30
In light of these concerns, we aimed to provide
data on real-world use of PPIs, and changes
thereof, across the past decade in an entire
national population. Specifically, we aimed to
determine patterns of use by patient and pre-
scriber characteristics, including treatment dura-
tion contrasting between higher- and lower-dose
PPIs. Furthermore, we described the proportion
of PPI use attributable to gastroprotection.
Methods
This was an observational drug-utilization study
describing the use of PPIs among the adult
Icelandic population (19 years or older) during
the period 1 January 2003 through to 31
December 2015.
Data sources
The Icelandic Medicines Registry (IMR) contains
individual information on all dispensed prescrip-
tion drugs in outpatient care in Iceland since 1
January 2003. We received information from the
IMR on PPI dispensing during the study period.
As of 2010, the IMR also contained information
on dispensed prescription drugs within nursing
homes in Iceland.31,32 Completeness of the IMR
ranged from 91% to 98% of all dispensed pre-
scription drugs for the study years. Information on
wholesale statistics of PPIs was provided by the
Icelandic Medicines Agency.33
The Icelandic Population Register provided
information about all citizens, Icelandic and for-
eign, residing in Iceland during the study period,
including data on month and year of birth, sex,
residency at 1 January 2003, migration status,
and date of death (if appropriate).
Using personal identification numbers, unique to
every individual residing in Iceland, we linked
together the variables from these two registries.
Study drugs
The drugs of interest were classified according to
the World Health Organization anatomical thera-
peutic chemical/defined daily doses (ATC/DDD)
classification.34 During the study period, four PPI
substances were prescribed in Iceland: omeprazole
(A02BC01), lansoprazole (A02BC03), rabepra-
zole (A02BC04), and esomeprazole (A02BC05).
We further categorized each PPI type by available
tablet strengths in milligrams as higher or lower
dose. In the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines, PPI doses
(in mg) are defined as standard/full dose, double
dose, or low dose.12 In the current study, standard
and double doses were defined as higher-dose PPIs
and low doses as lower-dose PPIs (Table 1).
On 1 February 2009, PPIs became available as
over-the-counter (OTC) products in Iceland.
However, the majority of PPIs during the study
period were obtained by prescription rather than
OTC, with OTC sales ranging from 1% in 2009
to 10% in 2015 of the total dispensed DDDs in
these years (Supplementary Table S1).
Information on the indication for the prescription
of PPIs was not available in the IMR. We explored
potential reasons for PPI use by assessing the pro-
portion of use attributable to gastroprotection,
that is, concurrent use of PPIs with acetylsalicylic
acid (ATC codes: B01AC06, N02BA01,
B01AC30), NSAIDs (ATC codes: M01, exclud-
ing M01AX), oral anticoagulants (ATC codes:
B01AA, B01AE, B01AF, B01AX06), and plate-
let inhibitors (B01AC04, B01AC07, B01AC22,
B01AC24, B01AC30).
Analysis
We presented overall use of PPIs in Iceland as the
total number of dispensed DDDs to the adult pop-
ulation stratified by calendar year, PPI substance,
ÓÖ Hálfdánarson, A Pottegård et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3
and specialty of the prescribing physician (primary
care, gastroenterology, and other specialties).
Annual prevalence (per 100 persons) of PPI use
was defined as the number of adult individuals
who filled at least one prescription in the relevant
calendar year (2003­2015) divided by the total
adult population residing in Iceland on 1 July of
that year. Further we reported the sex- and age-
specific prevalence of PPI use in 2015, the last
year of the study period (by 1-year age intervals
between ages 19­39 years and 80+ years). As a
sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis of
annual prevalence requiring at least two filled PPI
prescriptions in the relevant calendar year to be
classified as a prevalent user.
Annual incidence (per 100 persons per year) of
PPI use was defined as the number of adult indi-
viduals who, during the relevant calendar year
(2005­2015), filled their first PPI prescription
after a period of 24 months during which no PPI
prescriptions were filled, divided by the total
adult population residing in Iceland on 1 July of
that year.
To describe the duration of PPI use we used the
`proportion of patients covered' method, which
estimates the proportion of subjects that are alive
and covered by treatment on a given day after the
initiation of an incidence treatment episode. For
each patient, we estimated duration of each filled
prescription based on days' supply, assuming one
tablet as a daily dose. We allowed for a grace
period of 108 days (2 × the median number of
days between dispensing, that is, the number of
days by which 50% of the population had received
a subsequent dispensing), to account for irregular
prescription fills and added to the duration of
each prescription. If a patient did not fill a new
prescription within this time we considered them
to have discontinued their PPI treatment. They
could then later re-enter the user population upon
initiating a new treatment episode. We followed
incident PPI users for 5 years, from the date of
their first PPI prescription (day 0), and calculated
the proportion of patients covered by dividing the
number of users that were using the drug at day X
(defined by 30-day intervals) by the number of
people who were still alive and had not migrated
at day X. Furthermore, to assess differences in
treatment duration by patient age or by their pre-
scribed PPI dose, we stratified the duration analy-
sis by age (19­39, 40­49, 50­59, 60­69, 70­79,
80+ years), dose strength (higher versus lower),
and sex. In addition, we explored the distribution
in number of dispensed DDDs and tablets in the
first 5 years after start of initial treatment episode
(0­99, 100­199, 200­299, 300­399, 400­499,
500­599, 600­699, 700­799, 800­899, 900­999,
 1000).
To assess concurrent use of selected drugs (ATC
codes: M01 [excluding M01AX], B01AC06,
N02BA01, B01AC30, B01AA, B01AE, B01AF,
B01AX06, B01AC04, B01AC07, B01AC22,
B01AC24, and B01AC30), we calculated the
proportion (%) of prevalent PPI users in each
study year who also filled prescriptions for these
drugs within 90 days leading up to a PPI prescrip-
tion fill. To assess the pattern of concurrent use
among different age groups we performed a strati-
fied analysis by age (19­39, 40­64, 65+ years).
All analyses were performed using R version 3.4.235
and RStudio.36 The study was approved by the
National Bioethics Committee in Iceland (study
reference number: VSNb2015080004/03.03). As
the study was based on national registry data, we
did not obtain informed consent from individuals

Results
We observed 1,372,790 prescription fills for PPIs
over the entire study period. The vast majority
(95%) were higher-dose prescriptions. Among
313,296 individuals constituting our source pop-
ulation, a total of 101,909 (33%) filled at least
one PPI prescription, including 56,252 women
(55%) and 45,657 men (45%). The mean age at
first prescription fill was 46 years (interquartile
range 30­60). We observed a median of three PPI
prescription fills per patient (interquartile range
1­15). The median number of days between pre-
scription fills was 54.
During the study period, there was an increase in
total PPI use, measured as the number of dis-
pensed DDDs, from 3.5 million DDDs dispensed
in 2003 to 10.7 million DDDs dispensed in 2015
(Figure 1a). Primary-care physicians prescribed
the majority (60%) of all dispensed DDDs during
the study period, whereas gastroenterologists pre-
scribed 11% and physicians of other specialties
prescribed 29%. Prior to 2009, esomeprazole was
the most commonly prescribed drug among all
specialties. Although esomeprazole remained the
PPI of choice among gastroenterologists, ome-
prazole became the most commonly prescribed
PPI thereafter among nongastroenterologists
(Figure 1b­d).
Figure 2 shows an increase in annual prevalence
of PPI use with calendar time, from 8.5 per 100
persons in 2003 to 15.5 per 100 persons in 2015.
Meanwhile, the incidence of PPI use ranged from
3.3 per 100 persons in 2005 to 4.1 per 100 per-
sons in 2015. A more stringent measure of annual
prevalence, requiring at least two prescription fills
within a relevant year, yielded a prevalence of 5.4
per 100 persons in 2003 to 11.0 per 100 persons
in 2015 (Supplementary Figure S1). Prevalence
of PPI use was higher among women than men
and increased with patient age (Figure 3).
We identified 74,973 incident PPI users in our
study population, which we then followed for 5
years to estimate the proportion of users still on
treatment over time. Figure 4(a) shows the esti-
mated treatment duration stratified by patient
age. The proportion of patients still on PPI treat-
ment after 1 year was highest among those over
80 years of age, (36%) and lowest in those aged
19­39 years (13%). After 5 years, the proportion
was highest in those aged 70­79 years (20%) and
lowest among the youngest, 19­39 years (7%).
The majority of patients filled fewer than 200
DDDs/tablets during the first 5 years after start-
ing PPI treatment (Supplementary Figure S2).
Figure 4(b) shows PPI treatment duration among
incident PPI users stratified by strength of PPI
dose at treatment initiation. Of the 74,973 inci-
dent users, 70,720 (94%) initiated on higher-dose
PPIs and 4240 (6%) on lower-dose PPIs. The
proportion of patients still treated with the same
dose after 1 year was greater among those pre-
scribed higher- (21%) than lower-dose PPIs
(9%). The proportion of patients still on the same
dose was 13% versus 2% after 5 years, respectively
on higher- versus lower-dose PPIs. Duration of
treatment by PPI dose strength was nearly identi-
cal for both sexes (Supplementary Figure S3).
We observed a slight decrease in the proportion of
PPI users concurrently using drugs that have
been shown to be ulcerogenic or increase the risk
of bleeding, from 38% in 2003 to 36% in 2015
(Figure 5). The proportion of PPI users concur-
rently using NSAIDs decreased from 33% in
2003 to 24% in 2015. We observed an increase in
concurrent use of oral anticoagulants (3­6%),
acetylsalicylic acid (5­8%), and other platelet
inhibitors (2­3%). The proportion of PPI users
concurrently treated with any of these four drugs
was highest among those aged over 65 years (47%
in 2003, 47% in 2015) and lowest among the
youngest aged 19­39 years (21% in 2003, 17% in
2015) (Supplementary Figure S4).
Discussion
In this study, which covered all PPI dispensing in
an entire national population over 13 years, we
observed widespread and increasing use of PPIs,
especially among the elderly. Primary-care physi-
cians prescribed the vast majority of dispensed
PPIs in our study data. While the number of new
users remained relatively stable over time, the
results suggested that patients were increasingly
treated for longer durations than recommended
by clinical guidelines and mainly with higher-dose
PPIs.
The rising prevalence of PPI use across time
observed in our study is in line with recently

published reports in comparable populations.27,29,37
However, the prevalence in Iceland in 2015 was
more than twice that observed among adults in
Denmark in 2014 (15.5% versus 7.4%). GORD is
the most common indication for PPIs with an esti-
mated prevalence of 9­26% in European popula-
tions.38 Although our use estimates were within
this range, we were unable to draw definitive
conclusions on the appropriateness of PPI use in
Iceland as we did not have information on the indi-
cations for which PPIs were prescribed nor data on
the prevalence of GORD or other underlying con-
ditions in the population.
Inappropriate use of PPIs in the outpatient set-
ting, for example, in the form of inappropriate

indications and automatic renewal of prescrip-
tions without re-evaluation of patients' symptoms,
is a looming concern.25,39 Such concerns were
reinforced by Reimer and Bytzer's findings, which
showed that only 27% of people receiving long-
term treatment had a verified diagnosis justifying
the need for long-term treatment.40 The NICE
clinical guidelines recommend long-term PPI
therapy for rare conditions like Zollinger­Ellison
syndrome or Barrett's esophagus as well as for
patients with severe esophagitis, who have not
responded to an initial high-dose 8-week treat-
ment, and for patients who have experienced a
dilation of an esophageal stricture.12 In general,
the recommended duration of PPI treatment in
clinical guidelines rarely exceeds 12 weeks. We
found that 22% remained on treatment 1 year
after treatment initiation. The proportion was
highest among the oldest age group (36%) and
lowest among the youngest (13%). Extended
treatment durations among older adults are con-
cerning in light of widespread polypharmacy and
increased risk of adverse events with PPI use.41 In
fact, we observed that nearly half of older adults in
our data used PPIs concurrently with NSAIDs,
acetylsalicylic acid, oral anticoagulants, or platelet
inhibitors, reflecting the level of polypharmacy
among older adults using PPIs. Given the recent
evidence of PPIs potentially facilitating injurious
effects of NSAIDs in the small intestines, espe-
cially in older people and other high-risk patients,20
this pattern of high concurrent drug use might be

concerning. However, as we were unable to link
prescription data with clinical information, we
cannot rule out that these patients were appropri-
ately prescribed PPIs as bleeding prophylaxis.
The vast majority of PPI users in our population
initiated treatment with higher-dose PPIs and
after 1 year 21% remained on that treatment, for
example, had not switched to lower-dose PPIs or
discontinued treatment. This might indicate that
their underlying symptoms are more severe than
among those initiating treatment on lower doses
and reflect the level of difficulty some users expe-
rience when discontinuing treatment due to
resurfacing symptoms.42
Recently, Helgadottir and colleagues demon-
strated that among confirmed GORD patients on
long-term PPI treatment, women were more
likely than men to be able to lower their dose by
half, while still achieving symptom relief.43 In our
study we found no observable difference in treat-
ment durations by patient sex, nor did women
seem more likely to initiate or maintain treatment
on lower-dose PPIs. Thus, it is conceivable that
women might be able to tolerate lower PPI doses
than is mostly used nowadays.
The present study has several limitations. First, as
with all register-based drug studies, it is not cer-
tain that individuals who filled the PPI prescrip-
tions actually consumed the drugs. To address
this, we performed a sensitivity analysis
(Supplementary Figure S1) requiring at least two
PPI prescription fills within a year to count as a
prevalent PPI user, which resulted in lowered
prevalence estimates. Actual consumption might
thus in reality lie between these two measures of
prevalence. Second, the study data did not con-
tain information on clinical characteristics such as
indications underlying the PPI prescriptions and/
or the severity of symptoms, which prevented us
from drawing sound conclusions on the appropri-
ateness of PPI prescribing in our population.
Third, information on PPI use within nursing
homes was not included in the IMR until 2010,

upper gastrointestinal bleeding. NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

which presumably resulted in an underestimation
of the prevalence of PPI use among the elderly in
the first half of the study period. Fourth, informa-
tion on exact dosing for each prescription was not
available in our data preventing us from accu-
rately assessing prescribed doses. Our assess-
ments of PPI doses were based on dispensed
tablet strengths and therefore only an approxima-
tion of actual doses. Finally, PPIs became availa-
ble OTC on 1 February 2009. However, the
proportion of PPIs sold OTC was relatively low,
ranging from 1% to 10% of the total number of
DDDs sold annually from 2009 to 2015, and may
therefore only have led to a slight underestima-
tion of overall PPI use.
In conclusion, over a 13-year follow-up period we
observed a considerable increase of real-world PPI
use in a nationwide population setting, particu-
larly among older adults. We found that a number
of patients stayed on PPI treatment for longer
periods than is recommended by clinical guide-
lines, mainly on higher doses. In view of these
results, further initiatives towards appropriate pre-
scribing of PPIs, especially in terms of the adop-
tion of de-prescribing strategies, are warranted.
