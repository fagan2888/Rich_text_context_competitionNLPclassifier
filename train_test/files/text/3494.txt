Introduction
With the continuous expansion of urban areas in the
Philippines, it is undeniable that what used to be the original
heart of the city, the former central business district, gets
neglected (Alabado, 2005). Such is the case of Davao City,
Philippines. With the various infrastructural developments
and plans, it can be observed that the overall development of
the city is moving away from its center.
What Is the City's Center?
Local historians and other residents consider San Pedro
Street as the city's center for several reasons. According to
Delgado (2005), the street is home to several social land-
marks in the city aside from it being the central business dis-
trict. These are the San Pedro Cathedral, Davao City Hall,
and several parks that provided a busy atmosphere. The
design of the whole area was patterned after Spanish Town
Plazas as most of the sociocivic institutions were built in this
area (Delgado, 2005).
Today, San Pedro Street still has San Pedro Cathedral as
the center of Catholic faith, the Sangguniang Panlungsod and
the Davao City Hall as seats of power, the commercial estab-
lishments owned by old and new families residing in the city,
the Osmeña Park, and the Rizal Park.The Museo Dabawenyo,
a government-managed venue for art exhibitions for local
and visiting artists, is also located near San Pedro Street
(Figure 1).
Aside from that, San Pedro Street is full of irony. Despite
the glaring presence of religion and government in the area,
it has become a melting pot for illegal trade and some
immoral acts. Businesses are sprawling away from this area
and infrastructures looked old as well. The younger genera-
tion somehow forgot what the historical relevance of this
area is. The adults seemed to accept the fact that what remains
relevant in this area is purely trade while its other landmarks,
those that either carries the seat of power or religion, are
becoming less relevant.
Given this scenario, a creative work project was mounted
to know the relevance of San Pedro Street to the community.
It showcased several photographs with accompanying
soundscape to recreate the area. Together with the lookers of
the exhibition, the photographer conducted a simultaneous
meaning-making activity.
Qualitative meaning-making or reception studies, as
opposed to quantitative reception studies that aim to predict,
are considered relevant as this will aid in planning as the
meanings lookers give can provide planners and policy mak-
ers the areas' relevance to cultural identity.

Meaning-Making Exercise Using Images
and Soundscape: The Case of San Pedro
Street, Davao City, Philippines
Ma. Teresa Escano1 and Dennis John Sumaylo1
Abstract
This article explored the capacity of mixed media to elicit meanings from their lookers. A multisensory exhibition of
photographs and soundscape was utilized to achieve the objective. The photographs provided the visual stimulus while
soundscape accompanied the images to provide an aural map of the area being documented. Both media helped in the
meaning-making process. The area documented was the center of Davao City, Philippines--San Pedro Street--as it cradles
the center of faith, the seats of power, and the center of commerce. But, with urban decay, this place seemed to lose its
former glory. With the visual and aural stimuli, these stories (memories) embedded in the mind of the lookers are culled.
This is the meaning-making process.

Theoretical Underpinnings
The theoretical underpinning for this production includes
Visual Narrative Theory of Gretchen Barbatsis guided by
Aldous Huxley's The Art of Seeing.
According to Aldous Huxley, the general visual process
involves four stages. These are Sense, Select, Perceive, and
Remember. Sensing is defined as the detection of any visual
stimuli while selecting is the process of focusing on one
aspect of the entire visual stimuli detected. Perceiving, on the
contrary, is the stage when a looker tries to make sense of the
selected visual stimuli. This can be done by retrieving past
experiences or knowledge about the selected visual stimuli.
After perceiving comes remembering as the perceived mean-
ing of the visual stimuli can be stored and retrieved for future
use. This, in general, is the main objective of a visual com-
municator. It is not merely the creation of images that matters
but the creation of powerful images that would make the
looker remember its contents (Lester, 2006).
The creation of powerful images is grounded on the story
it tells. Ideally, when we talk of stories, it always has a begin-
ning, middle, and end arranged in a manner that one action
will trigger a reaction that would lead to its climax and then
eventually to its rightful end. In the context of visual narra-
tive, what is important is the balance between pictorial con-
tent and pictorial syntax or its descriptive and literal structures.
Simplified, the descriptive structure will tell the looker what
the story is. It describes what is in the picture. The descriptive
structure is the subject matter of the photograph. On the con-
trary, literal structure includes the rules and conventions of
visual elements. This includes spatial relations such as angle
and depth of field. Simplified, the literal structure is providing
how the story is being told (Barbatsis, 2005).
The theory of Visual Rhetoric of Sonja K. Foss almost
posits the same thing. Foss (2005) said that the nature of
visual rhetoric has two components: presented and sug-
gested elements. Presented elements include space, media,
shapes, and so on, while suggested elements are concepts,
ideas, themes, and allusions. The function of the image is to
communicate the action and that the perceptions of the
lookers are independent from its creator. Foss believes that
image should be treated as a form of language and that is
the language visual communicators use to be understood.
Creative Methodology/Process
A multisensory exhibit was conducted to document the
changes in what is used to be the heart of Davao City--San
Pedro Street. It was an exhibit that let the looker See, Hear,
and Feel San Pedro Street as they walk through it.
One of the goals of this exhibit was to highlight the street
in Davao City that cradles several landmarks--the San Pedro
Street. By capturing it in still photographs, lookers may be
able to reexamine the details of the place and experience it in
a different perspective. By using visual images, this exhibit
showed the culture of the people of Davao City and further
defined San Pedro Street with the help of the lookers.
Defining San Pedro Street through meaning-making
activity was the second goal of this exhibition. It was done
because almost always the photographer has the tendency to
present a subject according to the photographer's point of
view, moral judgments, and experience forgetting that the
lookers carry their own point of view, moral judgments, and
experiences as they view an image.
With these goals in mind and with the nature of the exhi-
bition being multisensorial, the photographer planned sev-
eral memory triggers to help in the meaning-making process.
These are images, sounds, and the celebration of Araw ng
Dabaw, an annual festival, that commemorates the city's
charterhood.
Finally, the exhibition billed Urban Sights and Sounds:
The Stories of San Pedro Street (USAS) was held inside a
shopping mall.

On Photography
Photography has been used in documenting many aspects of
our life. As Sontag (1973-1977) posited, families with chil-
dren almost always own a camera.
Today, the same methodology has been used to document
the life in the city. Naegele and Baur (2004) documented big
and small cities' public spaces, which are often thought of as
mundane and often neglected. This "pictorial archive" tried
to capture the "elusive smells and flavours in order to hand
them back to the people of the cities and their world." Kugler
(2009), who documented New York City as part of the
Megapolis Tour series, presented New York's "landscape--
its architecture, its youth, its feel, its trends and movement"
from his own perspective, personal view, and style including
blurry images of the Upper and Lower East Side, Grand
Central Station, and West Broadway to name a few while
Coughlin (1998) documented the same city using sepia-
toned images for elegance. Baechtold (2006) took on a new
concept of creating a completely visual travel guide of
Afghanistan by using maps and photographs. Baechtold's
creative premise lay on his idea that "one good photograph
and an address are enough to point the intrepid traveller in
the right direction." (blurb)
The same idea was used to document San Pedro Street of
Davao City, Philippines. The project tried to document the
then center of the city as Davao continues to grow outward.
It tried to use visual cues (photographs) as stimulus to cap-
ture the lookers' experiences, their personal stories in
the former center of the city. This part of the multisensorial
exhibition provided the seeing component of USAS.
Furthermore, the photographs used in USAS also coincides
with Nagar's (2012) argument that "street is a unique genre
of photography" that looks for "expression, beauty, and
social interaction in seemingly banal surroundings." (p. 10)
Szarkowski's five characteristics were considered.
Szarkowski as mentioned in Barrett (1990) considered the
thing itself, the detail, the frame, time, and vantage point that
make photography unique. To achieve this, 22 descriptive­
interpretive photographs were used depicting the landmarks,
people, and trade of the street. Descriptive photographs, as
defined by Barrett, offers "descriptive, visual information,
with greater or lesser detail and clarity," while interpretive
photographs try to explain phenomenon in a "personal and
subjective" manner (Barrett, 1990, pp. 53, 59).
With these characteristics, photograph type, and categori-
zation, the table below summarizes the shot list and actual
number of photographs used in USAS, and its general
characteristics.
This process of categorization of photographs followed the
tenets of visual narrative theory posited by Gretchen Barbatsis
(2005). According to Barbatsis, a visual narrative follows two
structures. These are descriptive and literal or discursive struc-
tures. Under the descriptive structure, the visual narrative
introduces the characters, settings, and actions of the images
made whereas the literal structure is more focused on the com-
positional patterns of spatial relations or the rules and

Category Photograph type Number of photos Characteristics
Landmarks Descriptive photographs 3 The photos were taken at low-angle to show implied height of
landmarks. Moreover, as lines as a visual element have expressive
values, vertical, horizontal, and oblique lines were utilized to show
strength, balance, power, and stability. The photos in this category
showcased the San Pedro Cathedral, the Sangguniang Panlungsod,
and the City Hall of Davao.
Trade Interpretive photographs 11 Pictures in this category were depicted both with and without human
subjects. An empty space was important to highlight a certain kind
of human interaction. It also showed the unusual way of peddling
products. In these photographs, one will see both the product and
the way sellers peddled these products. (Nagar, 2012)
The photos in this category included food vendors, outdoor flower
shops, religious products, second hand stores, and even those who
sell shade for their motorcycles, the iconic jeepney, and illegal items
such as knock-off movies and music, and other items.
People Descriptive­interpretive
photographs
8 This category also showed the kinds of people who frequented the
area which included local government officials during work, kids
at the park, and passersby. The photographer utilized both close-
up and long shots, balanced and asymmetrical subject matters, in
mostly high-key lighting to define the spatial relationship between the
looker and the subject matter. We tend to stand closer to children
therefore close-up shots were used while we stay far from people
who hold position, therefore long shots were utilized for the city
officials.

conventions of making images that dictates how an image can
be used as a language to communicate.
Using the shower­showee dichotomy of the theory, the
shower organizes different visual and pictorial elements (lit-
eral structure) into a coherent story so that the showee would
be able to come up with a meaning similar or related to the
original intention of the shower. One way to achieve this is to
use a certain pictorial point of view.
In Table 1, landmarks and trade were taken with an
observing point of view. The composition of each scene indi-
cated that the shower is "somewhat omniscient" looking at
the subject from the outside. The category on people used "a
participating point of view" as the shower was already part
of the world of the story. It means that there was a shift of
position from "looking at" to "looking into" (Barbatsis,
2005). The shift of position was very literal as most of the
photographs under the category people were tightly com-
posed trying to decrease the distance between the shower and
the subject leading to a certain level of visual intimacy
between the two (see Figures 2 and 3).
On Soundscape
Using two of Schafer's terminologies, the soundscape of
USAS featured both sound signals and soundmarks. Sound
signals are "foreground sounds intended to attack attention"
while the term soundmark is used as an analogy for landmark
(Wrightson, 2000).
Wrightson (2000) further discussed that the terminologies
coined by Schafer express the identity of a certain commu-
nity. It does not only showcase its architecture, people, and
culture. These three are also packaged in the form of sound-
scapes. Therefore, soundscapes, as described by Truax cited
in Wrightson (2000), acts as "mediator between listener and
the environment."
In the context of USAS, the soundscape created to accom-
pany the photographs tried to stay true to the sound of the old
city center without major alterations except adding fade-in
and fade-out and a little manipulation on the volume per sec-
tion. The increase and decrease of volume levels of certain
parts in the soundscape can act as a way to attract lookers and
at the same time be an unobtrusive background as lookers
scan the photographs.
In the creation of the accompanying soundscape of USAS,
the goal was to gather different actual soundscapes and then
mix them together to create aural chaos during the exhibi-
tion. The recreation of the actual chaos followed a careful
planned recording that allowed the lookers to retrace their
steps as they walked around the exhibition area as if they
were actually walking along San Pedro Street.
To achieve this, certain sounds were removed and high-
lighted through varying lengths and volume to give an aural
cue to the looker where he or she was at that moment in San
Pedro Street. The noise of traffic was also reduced in the
soundscape as it is the most obvious auditory signal you get
when you are in the area. Moreover, the curved design of the
panel boards representing the street and the low ceiling of the
exhibition area also functioned as external resonators of the
soundscape. These external resonators amplified the sound-
scape, which functioned both as sound signals and sound-
marks. The sound system used was an assembled speaker
sold in the area and it was placed near the panel board
intended for the stories gathered. This literal reproduction of
existing urban sounds provided the aural context of USAS.
This aural context can be described using Mermoz's
(2004) concept of sonic layering. In Mermoz's Istanbul Sound
Diary, sonic layering was accidental of his own "dialogue
with an interviewee with that of other voices, street sounds,
and call to prayer." (pp. 23-25) However, in USAS, its sonic
layering was intentional. The actual recording happened on
Escano and Sumaylo 5
the street and within the halls of the landmarks mentioned.
Conversations with people and clips of conversation of other
people were included. A council session of the local officials
and a celebration of a Catholic mass were also part of the
soundscape. Details of the content of the soundscape are pre-
sented in Table 2 and the succeeding discussions.
The intention of the first 9 minutes was to introduce the
city aurally through the voice of then Vice Mayor of Davao
City and now President of the Republic of the Philippines,
Rodrigo R. Duterte. Several details of the City Council ses-
sion were included in this part of the soundscape. After the
usual pleasantries of the Vice Mayor, the session started with
a prayer. In the soundscape, three different types of prayers
were included. These are ecumenical prayer, Muslim prayer,
and Lumad (Indigenous Peoples) prayer. The singing of the
City Hymn immediately followed and the presiding officer
of the city council called the session to order after the secre-
tary announced that there was a quorum. After the call to
order, the Official Exit Call of the head of Task Force Davao
followed. The breakdown of the first 9 min is as follows:
Pleasantries of the Vice Mayor 00:00-00:17
Prayer
Ecumenical Prayer 00:18-02:17
Muslim Prayer 02:18-02:35
Lumad Prayer (Indigenous Peoples) 02:36-03:40
Singing of City Hymn 03:41-05:42
Call to Order 05:43-06:34
Task Force Davao Exit Call 06:35-09:28
These were given importance as these are the things that
make Davao City one of the safest places to live in the world.
The City also protects its culture and its tri-people making
sure that they are represented in the highest governing body
of the city.
After the first 9 min, a recording of an ongoing celebra-
tion of Catholic mass immediately followed. The duration of
the introduction of the second landmark--San Pedro
Cathedral--was within the time frame 09:29-11:21. After
which, the soundscape started introducing the vendors out-
side the church to "show" through aural cues the trade aspect
of the area. Recordings of conversations between vendors
and customers were also included. However, in this part of
the soundscape, the volume for the Catholic mass and the
volume of the vendors were made sure to be at the same level
to "show" how close they were to each other.
Also included in the soundscape were sounds of foot-
steps and the increasing and decreasing volume of certain

elements to "show" movement. For instance, in 21:55, the
sound of the Catholic mass acted as bed music in low vol-
ume while the conversation of food and Ukay-ukay (sur-
plus) vendors was presented in high volume. Then, another
series of footsteps were introduced further diminishing the
sound of the Catholic mass and the food and ukay-ukay
(surplus) vendors but introducing a new product in the
area--massage, pedicure, and manicure. With these high-
lighted soundscape, it brought the lookers to another area in
San Pedro Street, which is Rizal Park. Going deeper into
the park, the previous sounds then became bed for another
product of San Pedro Street--bamboo flute. This time, the
sound of the bamboo flute was used as sound signals to get
the attention of possible lookers in the exhibit area. This
was intentionally done at the high notes of each excerpt of
a music piece played.
Furthermore, the photographer's movement, signified by
the sound of footsteps and by decreasing the volume of all
previously described soundscapes, introduced a new recre-
ation. At the farthest area of Rizal Park was a kiosk with
chessboards. This new sound was introduced at 55:15 up to
the end of the entire soundscape.
Finally, another relevant information the sonic layering of
soundscapes intended to convey was the varying age bracket
of the speakers presented in the audio material. From the San
Pedro Cathedral up to the entrance of Rizal Park, you could
hear voices of millennials. When you go deeper into the park,
you could listen to voices of retirees and senior citizens.
In general, the soundscape used in USAS gave further
characterization of San Pedro Street initially provided by the
photographs.
On Meaning-Making
The feel part of the exhibition started with how the photos
were arranged, the shape of the panel boards used, the ambi-
ance provided by street vendors, the various noises heard, the
provision of an actual street sign, and the celebration of the
city's charterhood which elevated the sense of pride of the
lookers during the exhibition.
Meaning-making was done by making the exhibition
interactive. Two panel boards were used for this purpose in
the exhibit area. Lookers were encouraged to post their expe-
riences on the walls provided. Pens, colored papers, pins, and
a writing table were also provided for this purpose. Colored
papers were intentionally used to make the exhibition visible
from afar, aside from the soundscape that captures attention
of lookers.
The guide question, Ano ang kwento mo sa daang San
Pedro? [What is your story in San Pedro Street?], was also
provided for the lookers to answer (see Figure 4).
In the process of gathering stories, lookers were able to
read other lookers' stories that somehow brought back mem-
ories and urged them to participate in the story sharing as
shown in Figure 5. Before the closing date of the exhibition,
lookers decided to post their stories directly on the photos
(see Figures 6 and 7).
Results and Discussion
With men as visual thinkers and women as aural thinkers, the
following stories were gathered during the USAS multisen-
sorial exhibition. A total of 281 stories (responses) were
gathered during the exhibition. The stories were categorized
into three--positive and humor, tragedy, and drama (love)--
and all are within the photo categories: trade, landmark, and
people.
Out of the 281 stories, 193 did not answer the guide ques-
tion provided or approximately 68.68% of the responses
while 88 or approximately 31.32% of the responses were
loyal to the guide question provided.
From the 88 stories, 19 (6.76%) were categorized under
negative or tragedy, 18 (6.41%) are categorized under drama
and love, while 51 (18.15%) covers positive and humor.
The stories gathered in Table 3 were varied, but there
were certain overlaps between trade, landmark, and people.
For the purpose of categorization, all stories focusing on the
storyteller fall under people while stories focusing on the
place rather than the doer of the action fall under landmark.
Stories under trade talked about the business rather than the
landmark.
Moreover, positive and humorous stories talk more on the
positive things San Pedro Street offered them while the
Escano and Sumaylo 7
negative or tragic stories range from funny embarrassing
moments, buying of knock-off goods and pirated movies, to
life threatening situations. Drama and love talk about inter-
personal relationships that started and developed within the
area.
In this whole exercise of meaning-making through images
and sound, San Pedro Street was used as a common setting. It
becomes the connection of all plots--happy, hopeful, and sad.
These are stories often told from the point of view of the law-
makers and those who disobey the law, the merchants who
peddle their goods, and the lost who turn to religion for guid-
ance. In the case of USAS, what is relevant in the meaning-
making process is the place where these stories took place
rather than focusing only on what narrative theories dictate as
essential in storytelling--beginning, middle, and end.
Furthermore, if you look at the gathered stories, you can
also see that the interpretations of the lookers are almost the
same as those of the photographer. That said, we can say that
the images can be treated as a language aside from being an
expressive art form. Like symbols, image needs interpreta-
tion and reinterpretation from the looker resulting to an
inductive exploration of the images focusing on its features,
feelings, knowledge, and function. By interpreting and rein-
terpreting the content of the images, the lookers were able to
dissect the presented elements, that is, space, shapes, and so

on, from suggested elements, that is, concepts, themes, allu-
sions, and so on (Foss, 2005).
Take for example the openness of the lookers in sharing a
negative story (including buying knock-off goods and pirated
DVDs) in public can be used as an allusion to the blatant
presence of vendors selling knock-off goods and pirated
DVDs within the presence of the City Hall, the Sangguniang
Panlungsod, and the church. These three institutions defined
piracy as stealing and that stealing is against the law of man
and God. Yet, it is present. This use of visual imagery, in the
context of visual rhetoric, as a way of illustrating, explain-
ing, and investigating the stories told in San Pedro Street,
again, does not complete the beginning, middle, and end pos-
ited by Barbatsis (2005). Instead, it only provides the
setting.
In general, the visual and aural messages served as "fun-
damental carrier of sense" as what sense-making structure or
narrative structure posits. The visual and aural messages
even made the lookers act as if they are really in San Pedro
Street. It is evident in the number of stories (responses) that
did not answer the guide question provided by the photogra-
pher. It can also be seen in the way the lookers interacted
with the photographs. The actual damage caused by pinning
the stories directly in the photo is an example of an act that
defies both laws of man and God as seen in the trade and
activities in the featured street.
The visual­aural overlap then became a channel that is
important in the process of storytelling. As the Theory of
Visual Rhetoric points out, the perspective of the lookers will
always be independent from its creator. Even if it reaches the
same interpretation, the process of interpreting it will be dif-
ferent. Simply put, Jordan et al. as cited in Hochmair (2004)
said, "To capture the meaning of a place, the place must,
besides its location, also be seen in the context of human
action and sensing" (pp. 26-27).
With this, can we infer that more and more people lose
interest in this area of the city as implied by the number of
stories (responses) gathered that are not related to the topic?
Does this also mean that through the years, people define San
Pedro Street as an area for cheap knock-off goods?
Furthermore, does this mean that the relevance of this area
being the center of government and religion, being the
assumed meaning of the place, is slowly fading? Finally, can
we infer that, just like its dilapidated buildings, its public
relevance is also dwindling?
Implications
Acity in decay is defined by Kevin Lynch, as cited inAgueda
(2010, p. 3), as
one that boomed in the past due to a single economic activity's
growth, in which it was specialized. That is why when the mode
of production changed and the industry moved, urban and social
structures were not fit to new circumstance.
He further posits that "urban decline can be understood as a
lack of adaptation to new conditions . . . as old spatial and
social structures have been unable to be transformed and
adjusted to new modes of production." (p. 4) Urban decay, in
retrospect, is an evidence of memory loss (Agueda, 2010).
In urban planning, urban decay creates a notion of for-
gotten realities that might lead to forgotten cultural identi-
ties, hence creating the relevance of meaning-making or
reception studies. As defined by Pernia (2004), reception
studies are concerned with "viewer's interpretations,
decodings, readings, meaning productions, and percep-
tions or comprehensions of communication and media
messages."(p. 47) Its significance to urban planning will
be in the context of heritage conservation as this is an
important element in the discussions on "cultural identity
and preservation of the past" (Matero, n.d.). Agueda (2010)
also reiterated that "urban decay makes memory retrieval a
much more urgent issue."
According to Matero (n.d.), the primary objective of con-
servation is cultural heritage protection before an area is
totally destroyed by urban decay and the lack of cultural and
historical relevance to its people. To establish such relevance,
planners and policy makers should know the relevance of
these areas through meaning-making exercises.
The same argument was raised by Agueda (2009) saying
that urban decay is closely linked to "productive reorganiza-
tion, economic transformations, and changing shifts." She
further posits that to reverse urban decay, "reinstitution of
value and lost status" to the area suffering from decay should
be made. This is where urban planning and even tourism can
come in as these can help in memory retrieval and cultural
heritage conservation.
Until today, the focal area for local festivities such as
Kadayawan Festival (August) and Araw ng Davao (March)
is still the San Pedro Street. Public transport routes from
the northern and southern parts of the city converge in San
Pedro Street. Therefore, the implication of this meaning-
making exercise in planning will be in infrastructural con-
servation by restoring original building designs around
San Pedro Street highlighting its economic value as evi-
denced by the stories gathered in this article. In one of the
stories, a looker emphasized that San Pedro Street was
their Abreeza (a high-end mall) during their time. Planning,
then, should capitalize on this. San Pedro Street is still
considered the central point for all routes of public trans-
port as evidenced by the stories gathered. Therefore,
pedestrian movement should be taken into consideration
when planning for this area. Moreover, another consider-
ation that planning should look into is to ascertain that no
further degradation will happen to San Pedro Street.
Recently, improvement of the City Hall façade was
observed as beautification projects that include placing
electrical and other cables underground.
With these, the implications of this article in heritage con-
servation can be summarized in the following points:
12 SAGE Open
·
· that infrastructural development should be consistent
with how this area will be developed as a heritage site
after several meaning-making exercises;
·
· that this area of Davao City, Philippines, should be
protected by the local government because of its his-
torical value; and
·
· that this area be treated as tourist attraction by the City
Tourism Authority patterned after the old Georgetown
Streets in Penang, Malaysia.
Recommendations
Other stories do not necessarily fall under the three types of
stories mentioned but these are worth mentioning as it tack-
les comments on specific photos and at the same time com-
ments on the whole exhibition which the photographer
believes to be a call from the lookers to relook at the city and
its expansion. The photographer also considers this as rec-
ommendation for future creative work exploring other iconic
areas of Davao City, Philippines.
