Introduction
Left ventricular (LV) dilatation after acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) is a major predictor of further prognosis
and development of heart failure. LV dilatation and remod-
elling starts immediately after AMI and is defined as
changes in both infarcted and non-infarcted regions of the
ventricle, leading to impaired contractile function, ventric-
ular dilatation and heart failure.1,2
Previous studies demonstrated relations between the
occurrence of LV remodelling after AMI and pre-existing
hypertension, size of an infarct area, revascularization of
the culprit artery, anterior location of the infarct, neurohu-
moral activation, including the sympathetic, beta-adrener-
gic and renin­angiotensin system (RAS).3­7 The effect of
thrombolysis or early interventional revascularization of
the infarct artery, -blockade and angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibition in the acute phase after AMI and
in the chronic phase of consequent development of heart
failure due to LV remodelling are widely discussed.

Abstract
Introduction: The development of left ventricular remodelling after acute myocardial infarction is a predictor of heart
failure and mortality. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether the polymorphism of angiotensinogen
(AGT) gene with threonine (T) instead of methionine (M) at amino acid 235 in exon 2 (M235T) had effects on cardiac
remodelling after acute myocardial infarction.
Methods: One hundred and forty-one patients (mean age 56.4±11.1 years) with a first acute myocardial infarction were
enrolled. Within 24­72 hours of the onset of the symptoms and at a four month period two-dimensional echocardiog-
raphy was performed. Remodelling was defined as a 20% increase from the baseline in left ventricular end-diastolic
volume. The genotypes of the study group were compared with the reference group (n=1010) genotypes. AGT M235T
polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification.
Results: At follow-up, 49 patients (34.7%) were classified as having left ventricular remodelling. Anterior localization of
the infarct (p=0.008), leucocyte count at admission (p=0.040), global left ventricular longitudinal strain (p=0.021) and MM
genotype of AGT (p=0.024) were independent predictors of ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction.
Conclusions: Anterior wall infarction, increased leucocyte count, decreased longitudinal strain of left ventricular and poly-
morphism of AGT M235T may predict remodelling after myocardial infarction.

However, significant heterogeneity exists in the pharmaco-
logical benefits of the standard treatment and prognostic
outcomes to individual subjects.8,9 Because of that, great
attention has been devoted to the evaluation of genetic vari-
ation of certain enzymatic systems, as a potential risk factor
in the development of LV remodelling. RAS plays a central
role in arterial blood pressure regulation and pathophysiol-
ogy of heart failure and many of the key proven pharmaco-
therapies based on RAS enzymatic inhibition are used in
patients with acute coronary syndromes and heart
failure.10
Angiotensinogen (AGT) is discussed as one of the
potential components of RAS to have a significant role in
LV remodelling and heart failure development.11 AGT is a
liver protein and is the substrate of renin.12 The reaction
between renin and AGT starts an enzymatic cascade that
generates the decapeptide angiotensin I, which is later con-
verted to angiotensin II by ACE and chymase. The human
AGT gene consists of five exons and four introns and is
located in the chromosome 1q42­43. The molecular variant
(M235T) of the AGT gene, encoding a threonine (T) instead
of a methionine (M) at residue 235 of the mature protein,
has been associated with higher plasma AGT levels in
patients homozygous for the T allele, which might have
crucial effects on pathophysiology of acute coronary syn-
dromes in acute and chronic phases regarding the develop-
ment of LV remodelling.11,13,14
The aim of the present study was to assess whether the
genetic background of the individual patient, particularly
polymorphism of AGT gene, might predict changes of LV
systolic function and volume size contributing to LV
remodelling in patients with AMI.
Materials and methods
Study population
One hundred and eighty-two patients with a first AMI (with
the symptoms from the onset of AMI not more than 72
hours) were enrolled into the study.All of them were treated
at the Cardiology Department of the Lithuanian University
of Health Sciences Hospital from October 2007 to March
2011 and underwent coronary angiography, following per-
cutaneous intervention of the culprit artery. The mean age
of the studied population was 56.4±11.1 years. AMI was
defined according to the standard criteria based on clinical
symptoms, ECG findings and cardiac enzyme abnormali-
ties.15 Exclusion criteria were as follows: prior myocardial
infarction; arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation; inade-
quate two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic images for
analysis; contraindication to coronary angiography/inter-
vention (including renal failure, bleeding tendency, shock
status, severe anaemia). Family history, cardiovascular risk
factors and current treatment were obtained from each
patient using a standard questionnaire. Hypertension was
defined as the presence of elevated systolic (>140 mmHg)
and/or diastolic (>90 mmHg) blood pressure or the current
use of antihypertensive drugs. A patient was considered as
a smoker if he was smoking at the current moment or was a
smoker in the past. Diabetes mellitus was identified when
dietary treatment and/or medical therapy was required to
control blood glucose levels. Hypercholesterolaemia was
defined as serum total cholesterol levels of 5.2 mmol/l or
more, low density cholesterol more than 2.6 mmol/l, and
triglycerides equal or more than 1.7 mmol/l or use of statin
medication.16
All the patients were invited for the follow-up visit at a
four-month period and underwent a repeated echocardio-
graphic examination. Data of 141 patients matching criteria
of the study design were further evaluated.
Reference group genotypes were used for the compari-
son with the genotypes of the AMI population. The refer-
ence group (N=1010) consisted of a random sample of
Kaunas population patients, taken from the epidemiologi-
cal HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial Factors In
Eastern Europe) study, free from symptoms of ischaemic
heart disease (IHD) and stroke.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients,
and the study protocol was approved by the ethics commit-
tee of the hospital.
Echocardiography
All AMI subjects were examined using 2D echocardiogra-
phy within 48­72 hours after the symptoms of AMI.
Patients were imaged in the left lateral decubitus position
using a commercially available system (Vivid Seven,
General Electric-Vingmed, Milwaukee, WI, USA).
Standard images were obtained using a 3.5-MHz trans-
ducer, at a depth of 16 cm in the parasternal (long- and
short-axis images) and apical (two-, three- and four-cham-
ber images) views. Standard 2D and colour Doppler data,
triggered to the QRS complex, were saved in a cine-loop
format. Measurements were averaged from at least three
consecutive beats. At baseline, 2D echocardiography was
used to assess conventional parameters such as LV end-
systolic diameter (LVESD), LV end-diastolic diameter
(LVEDD), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV end-dias-
tolic volume (LVEDV), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), wall
motion score index (WMSI), the mitral inflow peak early
velocity (E)/mitral annular peak early velocity (E'), or E/E'
ratio. 2D speckle-tracking imaging analysis for evaluation
of deformation parameters (strain) was also performed. At
four-month follow-up, 2D echocardiography was made
repeatedly to reassess LV volumes and LVEF. The LV vol-
umes (end-systolic and end-diastolic) and LVEF were cal-
culated from the conventional apical two- and four-chamber
images, using the biplane Simpson's technique.17 All other
echocardiographic dimensions, severity of mitral regurgita-
tion, assessment of regional contraction and evaluation, and
longitudinal strain of LV assessed by speckle-tracking
imaging were evaluated as described previously.18

LV remodelling was defined as a 20% increase in LV
end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) at four-month follow-up
compared with the baseline, respectively.19
Genetic analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from 3 ml EDTA venous
blood samples (white blood cells) using a commercial
DNA isolation kit ­ Sorpoclean Genomic DNA Extraction
Module kit (Sorpo Diagnostics, Vilnius, Lithuania) ­
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of
purified DNA were stored at ­20°C until use in real time-
PCR analysis. Subjects were genotyped for AGT gene
M235T polymorphism. Samples were genotyped with
TaqMan allelic discrimination Assay-By-Design (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Cycling conditions
were preceded by a denaturing step at 95°C for 10 min, fol-
lowed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, anneal-
ing at 60°C for 1 min. Allele-specific fluorescence was
then analysed on an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection
System with SDS v. 2.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was carried out using Software
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA).
Continuous variables were expressed as means ±
standard deviations (SDs) when normally distributed,
and as medians (25th, 75th percentiles) when not nor-
mally distributed. Continuous variables were assessed
using the unpaired Student's t test and Mann­Whitney U
test, as appropriate. Categorical variables are presented
as absolute numbers and percentages and are compared
using the 2 test. Differences in echocardiographic vari-
ables (baseline vs. four months) were assessed by paired
Student's t test. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were
analysed with the 2 test. In order to predict LV remodel-
ling in an individual patient, clinical, echocardiographic
and genetic variables were put into logistic regression
analysis. Variables with statistical significance at uni-
variable analysis were further analysed at multivariable
analysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Feasibility
A total of 182 consecutive AMI patients matching the
inclusion criteria were screened initially. Eight subjects
did not complete the follow-up because of their decision
not to participate in the repeated evaluation. One AMI
patient died during a four-month follow-up (non-cardiac
cause of death) and seven patients were withdrawn from
the study because of the recurrent symptoms of angina/
infarction with following percutaneous coronary interven-
tion percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Twenty-six
patients (14.3%) with poor quality echocardiographic
images were excluded from the further evaluation after the
first echocardiographic evaluation.
Clinical and echocardiographic patient
characteristics
At follow-up, 49 patients (34.7%) were classified as having
LV remodelling. Age, gender, time from AMI symptoms to
revascularization, body surface area, ischaemic heart disease
risk factors, use of medications at follow-up, and number of
involved coronary arteries showed no significant differences
between the two groups (Table 1). Patients with LV remodel-
ling were more frequently prone to anterior wall MI (p<0.01),
higher leucocyte count value at admission (p<0.01), lower
LVEF (p<0.05), increased LVESV (p<0.05) and higher
WMSI (p<0.01) at the acute episode of MI. Parameters of
myocardial deformation such as global systolic longitudinal
strain of LV and global systolic longitudinal strain rate of LV
were lower at baseline in AMI patients who developed LV
remodelling at follow-up. There were no differences between
the groups in mitral regurgitation (MR) grade or E/E' ratio.
Frequencies of AGT gene genotypes
AGT genotype and allele frequency distribution of LV
remodelling and non-LV remodelling groups were accord-
ing to the Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05).
The frequencies of the genotypes of AGT gene from the
studied AMI population are presented in Table 2. Patients
with LV remodelling significantly more often were carriers
of the MM genotype when compared with non-LV remod-
elling group patients (p=0.02). When genotype frequencies
were compared between AMI patients and reference group
patients, patients from the non-LV remodelling group more
rarely were carriers of the MM genotype (p=0.0005), while
LV remodelling group patients have not shown any signifi-
cant differences in genotypes compared with the general
population.
At follow-up, patients with MM genotype had larger
LVESD (34.6±4.8 mm vs. 30.3±4.8 mm, p<0.05), LVEDV
and LVESV (99.81±28.5 ml vs. 88.1±25.1 ml, p<0.05 and
49.7±19.9 ml vs. 41.2±17.7 ml, p<0.05, respectively) and
lower LVEF (48.6±6.5% vs. 52.46±9.3%, p<0.05) than
patients with the TM or TT genotype (Table 3). Patients
with the MM genotype revealed decreased LVEF at follow-
up when compared with the initial parameters (48.6±6.5%
vs. 53.2±7.6%, p<0.05), while carriers of the TM+TT geno-
type showed a significant improvement of LVEF at follow-
up (52.46±9.3% vs. 49.3±8.6%, p<0.05).

Clinical and genetic predictors of LV
remodelling
When clinical, echocardiographic and genetic variables
were put into the logistic regression analysis, significant
predictors of LV remodelling were revealed: anterior locali-
zation of the infarct (p=0.012), leucocyte count at admis-
sion (p=0.038), LVESV (p=0.041), baseline LVEF
(p=0.011), global longitudinal strain (p=0.001) and MM
genotype (p=0.037) (Table 4). Multivariable analysis
revealed that anterior localization of the infarct, leucocyte
count at admission, global longitudinal strain and MM gen-
otype were independent predictors of LV remodelling after
AMI (Table 4).
Discussion
In the present study we have analysed the possible impact
of several clinical, echocardiographical and genetic factors,
particularly the polymorphism of the AGT gene on ventric-
ular remodelling following AMI. Results of our study
revealed that predominance of the anterior wall MI,
increased white blood cell count at admission, reduced
global systolic longitudinal strain assessed by speckle-
tracking imaging and polymorphism of the AGT gene inde-
pendently had an impact on LV remodelling development
after AMI.
LV remodelling occurs in a quite significant number of
AMI patients and is associated with development of heart

failure, cardiac arrhythmias and a poor survival rate,
therefore early identification of this consequence of AMI
is clinically very important.3,4,20 The process of LV remod-
elling begins immediately after the onset of acute MI.
Along with the changes of the infarct zone and non-infarct
area of the LV, activation of the neurohumoral system
after AMI plays an important role in post-infarct remodel-
ling development.1,21
The RAS deserves to be pointed out in the pathophysiol-
ogy of the post-AMI remodelling process.11,22,23 Post-
infarction activation of that system stimulates the
intracellular signalling pathway, resulting in the increase of
myocytes and fibroblasts protein synthesis, leading to the
cell hypertrophy and fibrosis of the ventricle. Other effects
such as increased vessel permeability, growth factor and
metalloproteinases activation, haemodynamic overload
through vasoconstriction and water retention, increased
oxidative stress and direct cytotoxic effect leading to cell
death through necrosis or apoptosis are observed.23­25
Furthermore, effects of the RAS in the remodelling devel-
opment can be demonstrated by effectiveness of the RAS
blocking treatment on post-infarction remodelling, which
was demonstrated in previous studies and trials.8,9
In our study, we have analysed the impact of AGT poly-
morphism on prediction of LV remodelling. Patho
physiologically, AGT is one of the key components of
RAS, playing an important role in the RAS enzymatic cas-
cade.13 AGT is converted by renin into angiotensin I and
further cleaved to angiotensin II by ACE. Accordingly,
AGT and AGT gene polymorphism become important
determinants of angiotensin II level in both serum and tis-
sues and have crucial effects in the remodelling process
after AMI. It is possible that carriers of the particular geno-
type of AGT M235T gene may have different levels of cir-
culating AGT or different pathophysiological effects on the
vessels, tissues, enzymatic reactions or other pathophysio-
logical processes. The results of our study showed associa-
tions between the genetic polymorphism of AGT and
post-infarct remodelling. Impairment of the echocardio-
graphic parameters such as LV end-systolic and end-dias-
tolic volumes and LVEF at follow-up in carriers of MM
genotype suggested a hypothesis of the genetic background
on LV remodelling progression after myocardial infarction.
In previous studies, the impact of T allele of AGT M235T
on the etiopathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases has been
much discussed. However, data from the different studies
revealed some disagreement. In several meta-analyses, the
TT genotype was associated with increased risk for hyper-
tension;12,13,26 in a few studies an association between AGT
gene polymorphism and LV remodelling and hypertrophy
in healthy subjects, mainly athletes,27 dialysis patients28
and hypertensive patients was demonstrated.29 Although
some authors have found the T allele to be a risk factor for
MI or severity of coronary heart disease,11,30,31 others found
no association.7 Sekuri et al. showed that the risk of
premature coronary heart disease in subjects with the AGT
MM genotype was significantly higher when compared
with individuals not carrying the M allele.32 Similar results
were published by Fernández-Arcás et al., where M allele
was reported as an independent risk factor for MI.33 In the
analysis of our results of genotype distribution between the
LV remodelling group and non-LV remodelling group, MM
genotype demonstrated predominance in the LV remodel-
ling group, suggesting that patients with MM genotype
have a higher susceptibility to LV remodelling after AMI.
Furthermore, the echocardiographic parameters of the
group with MM genotype also demonstrated the dilatation
of LV and impairment of systolic function of LV at follow-
up. Interestingly, combined analysis of the general popula-
tion and AMI patients' genotypes demonstrated that
prevalence of MM genotype is the same in the overall pop-
ulation and patients with LV remodelling, and T allele is
significantly rare in patients with LV remodelling; T allele
is much more common in patients without LV remodelling.
This suggests that T allele may have a protective role in LV
remodelling etiopathogenesis and unfavourable LV remod-
elling is seen less in carriers of T allele. Regarding our data,
at least in the patient population with AMI the possibility of
M235T polymorphism of AGT as an additional risk factor
for the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes could not
be excluded.
The importance of localization of the infarct and the
increase of the inflammatory markers at the onset of AMI
on the LV remodelling development have been described in
our previous study18 and are supported by some other
authors.34,35 The present study also revealed a predictive
value of anterior wall infarction and increased count of leu-
cocytes while troponin I and C-reactive protein did not
reveal statistical significance. Anterior localization of AMI
contributing to the larger size of infarction involving apical
segments of the LV has been demonstrated to be a signifi-
cant predictor of worse outcome after AMI.4,35,36 Despite
the increase in white blood cell count, C-reactive protein,
cardiac necrosis markers, which have been demonstrated as
predictors of ventricular remodelling, and also the other
serum markers such as BNP, tenascin, and homocysteine
have been demonstrated to have a role in post-infarct
remodelling,34-38 although these markers have not been
evaluated in our study.
The early initial evaluation of systolic function of the LV
is very important in post-infarct LV dysfunction assessment
and is a marker in the further prognosis statement after
AMI.39 Furthermore, the diagnosis of ventricular remodel-
ling is mainly based on the echocardiographic evaluation at
follow-up. Our results revealed that initial decrease of
LVEF and enlarged end-systolic volume may predict LV
remodelling. A novel echocardiographic parameter of myo-
cardial deformation such as longitudinal strain of the LV
(assessed by speckle-tracking imaging) may be suggested
as an independent echocardiographic predictor for LV

remodelling in regard to our results. Lower values of the
ventricular longitudinal strain when measured at an acute
episode of MI have been demonstrated to be a prognostic
marker for patients surviving AMI. The diagnostic reliabil-
ity of longitudinal strain is still under evaluation and it has
been reported as a novel sensitive diagnostic echocardio-
graphic parameter in some studies, while showing no
exceptional importance in the others.18,19,39,40
Limitations
The main limitation of our study is the modest number of
patients in a few genotype groups, but despite that, statisti-
cal analysis showed significant differences in the variables
we have analysed and allowed us to suggest a few predic-
tors of LV remodelling including AGT genotype. To meas-
ure the impact of genetic factors in such a multifactorial
disease as AMI, in which many risk factors and heterogene-
ous mechanisms are implicated, continuing studies are
needed.
Conclusions
Results of our study revealed that predominance of the ante-
rior wall infarction, increased white blood cell count at admis-
sion, reduced longitudinal strain of left ventricular and
polymorphism of AGT M235T may be presented as predictors
of left ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction.
