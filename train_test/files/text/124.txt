Research Question
In response to the global financial crisis, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) established
several emergency facilities during the period from December 2007 to April 2010 peaking
at USD 1.2 trillion at the end of 2008. The emergency facilities aimed at lifting liquidity
constraints and mitigating bank lending contraction. Funds from the emergency facilities
were accessible to U.S. banks as well as subsidiaries of foreign banks. The latter are parts
of internal capital markets of internationally active bank holding companies (IBHCs).
This study asks whether unconventional U.S. monetary policy in terms of emergency
facilities transmitted to banking markets outside the U.S. and changed interest rate setting
behavior.
Contribution
With this analysis, we contribute to the literature on the cross-border transmission of
monetary policy by examining the link between the Fed emergency facilities and the legal
framework in which non-U.S. banks have access to them. The study employs detailed
information on the use of emergency liquidity of U.S. banks that had not been available
prior to 2011 due to restrictions by the Fed. The data allow us to differentiate between
German banks with access to the U.S. liquidity support and banks without access. Our
approach compares interest rates of both groups of banks during the period in which the
emergency facilities were active and the surrounding period.
Results
We find a significant, contemporaneous decline in the short-term deposit rates of banks
with access to the U.S. liquidity facilities compared to banks without access to these
funding sources. Banks with access to these facilities show significantly decreased short-
term funding costs, while both credit pricing and lending volumes remain unchanged.
Short-term corporate loan rates decline as well with a lag between two to four months.
These spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy are confined to short-term rates.

Abstract
We show that emergency liquidity provision by the Federal Reserve transmitted to
non-U.S. banking markets. Based on manually collected holding company struc-
tures of international banks, we can identify banks in Germany with access to U.S.
facilities via internal capital markets. Using proprietary interest rate data reported
to the German central bank, we compare lending and borrowing rates of banks
with and without such access. U.S. liquidity shocks cause a significant decrease in
the short-term funding costs of German banks with access. Short-term loan rates
charged to German corporates also decline, albeit with lags between two and four
months. These spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy are confined to short-term
rates.

1 Introduction
What are the cross-border implications of the pervasive provision of emergency liquidity
facilities by central banks for corporate loan and deposit rates? By the end of 2008, the
federal funds rate was at the zero-lower bound, thereby rendering further conventional
monetary policy unavailable. To mitigate continuing funding pressure, Figure 1 shows
that the U.S. Federal Reserve distributed up to 1.2 trillion USD by means of various
emergency lending facilities and the Discount Window to financial institutions with a
U.S. banking charter. Notably, the cost of liquidity from these facilities was well below
the refinancing cost of the European Central Bank (ECB), as illustrated in Figure 2,
and more than half of the distributed volume was used by affiliates1 of foreign banks
(Benmelech, 2012; Acharya, Drechsler, and Schnabl, 2014). We test if U.S. emergency
liquidity was re-allocated via the internal capital markets of international (non-U.S.) bank
holding companies (IBHC), thereby affecting banks' funding and lending terms outside
the U.S. economy.

Investigating the effects of liquidity assistance is particularly relevant because Bernanke
and Gertler (1992, 1995) and Kashyap and Stein (2000) emphasize that banks already
fail to fully transmit conventional monetary policy when facing funding constraints and
uncertainty about liquidity access (see also Freixas, Martin, and Skeie, 2011), a limitation
aggravated at the zero-lower bound (Adam and Billi, 2007, 2014). The empirical evi-
dence for the U.S. emergency liquidity provision suggests that it mitigated banks funding
pressure fairly well (Wu, 2011; Syrstad, 2014),2 effectively substituting for conventional
monetary policy in terms of employment and output responses (Gambacorta, Hofmann,
and Peersman, 2014). Whereas short-term funding pressure mounted, lending volumes
contracted, and lending rates increased in the U.S. due to the crisis (Santos, 2010; Ivashina
and Scharfstein, 2010), emergency liquidity lines mitigated domestic lending contraction
especially through large banks (Berger, Black, Bouwman, and Dlugosz, 2014). However,
the consequences of unconventional U.S. monetary policy for credit and funding outside
the U.S. remain uncharted, which is what we shed light on with this paper. In contrast
to the aforementioned contributions surrounding the U.S. emergency lending facilities,
we therefore examine the cross-border impact and furthermore include all established
facilities.
So far, most analyses of cross-border responses to the financial crisis pertain to lending
and funding volumes rather then pricing, which is our focus. Crisis-ridden banks reduced
foreign lending significantly (De Haas and Van Lelyveld, 2010; Giannetti and Laeven,
2012a,b; Schnabl, 2012; De Haas and Van Horen, 2012).3 This pattern is consistent with
the seminal evidence by Peek and Rosengren (1997, 2000), who find a significant flight
home effect of Japanese banks contracting their lending to U.S. firms in response to
the stock market crash at home. The withdrawal from both foreign credit and funding
markets is, however, not homogeneous across foreign markets, indicating the importance
of actively managed internal capital markets of IBHCs in re-allocating financial funds
globally (see Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012a,b; Galema, Koetter, and Liesegang, 2015).
We complement these studies by investigating the role of such internal capital markets
for the cross-border transmission of monetary policy in terms of pricing, thereby testing
more directly the implications for banks' cost of funding and corporates' cost of bank
debt.
Contrary to prior studies on the pass-through of policy and shocks via internal capital
markets of nationally active banks,4 we use a unique setting with three main advantages
to cast more light on the international transmission of monetary policy. Our setting
hinges on the release of micro data regarding the use of U.S. liquidity on a bank-by-bank
basis, manually collected internal capital market connections of IBHCs and supervisory
information on interest rate setting for new credit and funding by banks outside the
U.S. with and without access to emergency liquidity provided by the Fed. As such, we
contribute to the few studies of the international transmission of monetary policy through
2Both the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) mitigated liquidity shortages
of banks (Fleming, Hrung, and Keane, 2010), but did not reduce their borrowing costs relative to LIBOR (Kuo, Skeie,
and Vickery, 2012). Duygan-Bump, Parkinson, Rosengren, Suarez, and Willen (2013) find that the ABCP Money Market
Mutual Funds Liquidity Facility (AMLF) significantly reduced ABCP yields and prevented fund outflows. Puddu and
W¨
alchli (2012) show that TAF funds were successful in reducing the liquidity risk of U.S. banks.
3Lending contraction effects are particularly pronounced when banks are highly leveraged (Devereux and Yetman, 2010),
thereby adding to the dissemination of the financial crisis to both emerging (Popov and Udell, 2012) and developed economies
(Acharya and Schnabl, 2010; Aiyar, 2012).
4Such as Campello (2002) for the U.S., Cremers, Huang, and Sautner (2011) for the Netherlands, or Frey and Kerl
(2015) who consider domestic lending conditional on internal capital market activity.

internationally active banks, such as Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012a,b) who observe capital
flows in the networks of internationally active U.S. banks or Buch, Koch, and Koetter
(2011b) who analyze balance sheet composition of German banks with access to the Term
Auction Facility (TAF).
A first important challenge to these studies that we overcome is that emergency liquid-
ity usage is conventionally unobservable to avoid stigmatization and self-fulfilling prophe-
cies of bank distress due to a deterioration of banks' market values (Cyree, Griffiths, and
Winters, 2013). We take advantage of the public release of detailed data on the identity
of all banks that used any of the six different U.S. emergency facilities or the Discount
Window, which had to be released in 2011 under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
after a lawsuit filed by Bloomberg L.P. against the Federal Reserve System in 2008 (New
York Southern District Court, 2008). The published data on emergency facilities and
the Discount Window lists daily funds outstanding for all individual entities between
December 2007 and April 2010.
Second, the identification of an exogenous monetary policy shock is crucial, yet noto-
rious due to the simultaneity between banking system health and the policy stance. The
Bloomberg data provides the names, the timing, and the volume of Fed liquidity used
by non-U.S. banks. We identify the exogenous effect of this unconventional monetary
policy by comparing banks on German soil that have access to U.S. liquidity facilities
via their affiliates to those banks on German soil that have no such access. To this end,
we manually identify the IBHC with which the "Bloomberg banks" are associated and
whether these IBHCs operate in Germany. Figure 3 vividly illustrates the intensive use
of U.S. emergency liquidity by German banks. They tapped up to 100 billion EUR in
September 2008, which amounts to around 10% of the entire volume of the U.S. facilities
at the time and is in size comparable to the contribution of Germany's financial system
to German GDP.
Third, if liquidity shocks are transmitted to banking markets outside the U.S. through
an internal capital markets channel by IBHCs, we expect to see systematically different
loan and deposit rates charged on markets outside the U.S. for any additional credit or
funding business generated. Such detailed lending and funding rates for new rather than
outstanding stocks of loans and deposits are rare. We use detailed interest rate data on
new business reported monthly by a representative sample of both German and foreign
banks to the German central bank, the Bundesbank. We collect data from annual re-
ports of all IBHCs and match these with all 217 German banks that report detailed loan
and funding prices on a monthly basis. In contrast to studies confined to large syndicated
loans (e.g. Giannetti and Laeven, 2012a) or wholesale corporate funding auction platforms
(e.g. Acharya, Imbierowicz, Steffen, and Teichmann, 2015) to identify transmission effects
of monetary policy, we thus investigate marginal interest rates charged by a representa-
tive sample of banks on commercial and industrial lending to a wide range of corporate
customers.
Our results clearly show that short-term funding costs of German banks vis-`
a-vis
corporate depositors declined significantly in response to U.S. liquidity assistance. Short-
term deposit rates offered to corporates in Germany by banks with access via the internal
capital market of their IBHC were lower compared to short-term deposit rates offered
by banks without access to the U.S. emergency facilities. For each percent of emergency
funding per total IBHC assets, short-term deposit rates decline by 2.3 basis points. An

increase in using the emergency lending facilities by one standard deviation in this case
corresponds to a lowering in short-term funding costs by 1.1%. As such, the objective of
U.S. monetary policy to reduce short-term funding pressure of banks even extended be-
yond the boundaries of its own market, albeit at a small magnitude. Short-term corporate
loan rates declined after a lag of two to four months. In contrast, neither long-run lending
nor funding interest rates exhibit significant differential effects. Likewise, both lending
and deposit volumes do not respond significantly. These results confirm that liquidity
emergency policies might have eased pressure on the short end of the yield curve, but
could not reduce longer term risk premia.
We also find that banks with less pre-crisis exposure to Asset Backed Commercial
Paper (ABCP) exhibit a decline in short-term funding rates. The magnitude of this effect
declined for growing ABCP exposures, but remains significantly negative. Consistent with
this result we also find that the reduction in funding cost are larger for banks that held
more liquidity prior to 2007. This result suggests that banks facing no or weak funding
constraints substituted other conventional liabilities with cheaper U.S. liquidity as sug-
gested by studies advocating the existence of global, actively managed internal capital
markets. We also find that the weakest banks in terms of capitalization reduced funding
cost the most. Thus, access to additional emergency funds through internal capital mar-
kets did succeed in easing short-term financing conditions for banks substantially exposed
to funding constraints.
Our results are robust toward a plethora of alternative definitions of access to U.S.

facilities via internal capital markets, the inclusion of explicit liquidity measures, and
semi-annual × bank fixed effects to gauge possibly confounding (unconventional) Eu-
ropean monetary policy measures, matched sampling of banks in Germany to address
potential concerns of self-selection of large banks into international activities, placebo
tests regarding the timing of liquidity support facilities, and alternative lag structures
regarding the transmission speed of U.S. monetary policy to interest rates in the German
banking market via internal capital markets.
2 Identification and Methodology
2.1 Facilities and IBHC networks
As a response to the interbank market breakdown resulting from the subprime mortgage
crisis in 2007, the Federal Reserve established six different funding facilities in addition to
the Discount Window. Although the discount rate was already substantially lowered by
December 2007, institutions hardly made use of the Discount Window, possibly to avoid
stigmatization. The Term Auction Facility (TAF) and the five other facilities installed
subsequently, were thus created as new monetary policy instruments to alleviate liquidity
shortages in the financial market in general, rather than supporting individual institutions
in need.
Liquidity provision through these facilities took various forms:5 TAF, established in
December 2007, provided short-term credit (for a maximum of 84 days) through bi-weekly
auctions to deposit-taking financial institutions against a wide range of collateral until
March 2010. In March 2008, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and Term Secu-
rities Lending Facility (TSLF) were established to provide overnight loans and exchange
various types of collateral (including ABCP) against Treasury collateral. The ABCP
Money Market Mutual Funds Liquidity Facility (AMLF) helped institutions to finance
purchases of high-quality ABCP from mutual funds from September 2008 onward, with
further liquidity provision through the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), es-
tablished only one month later, supporting the market for commercial paper in general.
Additionally, primary dealers were provided with liquidity through single-tranche open
market operations (STOMO) between March and December 2008. All facilities, with the
exception of TAF,6 were abolished on February 1, 2010.
Figure 1 illustrates the development of total funds outstanding in relation to the U.S.
economy and the U.S. financial sector. By the end of 2008, the size of the facilities
corresponded to up to around 8% of total annual U.S. GDP, and 135% of annual U.S.
financial sector output. The Federal Reserve System's emergency facilities were thus
significantly larger in size than the U.S. government's assistance provided through the
Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP, around 430 billion USD). For an institution
to directly participate in the auctions or have access to the facilities, it had to be an
entity with a U.S. banking charter, which includes affiliates of non-U.S. IBHCs, thereby
providing these banks also with access to U.S. emergency liquidity.
Figure 4 illustrates the three possibilities how we identify banks, that report interest
rates to the German central bank, and faced a positive funding shock. The first channel

German branches and subsidiaries of U.S. IBHCs had access via their internal capital
markets. And third, German affiliates of non-U.S., non-German IBHCs, that also operated
affiliates in the U.S.
Figure 4: Illustration of observed cases of treated banks
The figure below illustrates the three different possible cases, in which a bank in Germany can have access to U.S. emergency
lending facilities through its network. We observe interest rates for 217 different banks in Germany, which are considered
to be treated, whenever one bank in its IBHC is a registered bank in the U.S. and can thus have access to U.S. facilities.

Banks are considered members of a certain IBHC whenever the latter has an equity
interest or voting rights of more than 50% in the bank. Therefore, we manually gather
ownership data from the annual reports of IBHCs associated with banks revealed on the
Bloomberg list. In case there was a mid-year change of ownership during the time the
facilities were in operation, the date of ownership change stated in the annual reports is
used. Where no annual reports were available, the IBHC-association was confirmed by
information from official company websites.

One exception are German savings banks, which exhibit a two-tiered network struc-
ture that consists of multiple regional savings banks being associated with one so-called
Landesbank. The latter acts as a head institution for the local savings banks in a certain
region conducting, for example, capital market operations or payment services on their
behalf. Landesbanken conduct their business only in certain states (Bundesl¨
ander) and
are typically jointly owned by the regional savings banks and the states where they are
located. Following the approach of Puri, Rocholl, and Steffen (2011), we thus consider
a regional savings bank to have access to U.S. emergency liquidity if they are tied to a
Landesbank with a U.S. branch or subsidiary.7
Figure 5 shows that this identification scheme results in 139 out of the 217 banks in
our sample that are members of an IBHC with access to Federal Reserve funding facilities.
These 139 banks on German soil with access to the U.S. liquidity facilities belong to 22
non-U.S. IBHCs, of which all operated their branches or subsidiaries already in 2004, the
commencement year of the formal interest rate statistics, up and until today with one
exception.8 This persistent internationalization pattern in terms of foreign affiliates is
consistent with the results reported by Buch, Koch, and Koetter (2011a) and suggests a
systematic self-selection of (large) banks in to the U.S. market in anticipation of future
emergency liquidity provision to be unlikely. Nonetheless, we also consider various alter-
native access definitions, which are indicated in the bottom portion of Figure 5, and for
which we report results in the Online Appendix.
2.2 Specification of emergency facility effects
Based on this identification of internal capital market access of IBHCs to Federal Reserve
liquidity facilities, we estimate the effects of U.S. liquidity support on interest rates set in
Germany in two ways.
First, we specify a canonical difference-in-difference model that compares interest rate
differentials between banks with and without access to U.S. emergency liquidity due to
the presence of an AFFILIATE prior to the inception of facilities in December 2007
to interest-rate differentials between banks of these two groups after the facilities were
abandoned in May 2010. In this baseline estimation we examine a possible change in
the funding conditions of banks with access to U.S. funding. We estimate the following
regression:
ri,m
=m
+ it
+ AFFILIATEi
× POSTm
+ Xi,m-1
+ i,m
. (1)
The dependent variables ri,m
are different lending and funding interest rates of bank i
in month m, AFFILIATEi
is a dummy variable equal to one if a bank has access to
emergency funding through a U.S. affiliate in its IBHC network. POST is an indicator
of the period after the liquidity treatment stopped and ranges from June 2010 until
December 2014. Xi,m-1
represents a vector of control variables, which are lagged by one
month and winsorized by 1% at both ends of their distribution to control for outliers.
Control variables are Bank Size, Wholesale Funding, Leverage Ratio, Latent Liabilities,

the U.S., and all other markets.

Figure 5: Illustration of data sample
Overview of sample structure by types of banks with and without access to Federal Reserve funding facilities. The analyzed
data sample is constructed of German banks included in the interest rate report of Deutsche Bundesbank (Zinsstatistik).
Banks with access includes all banks which are part of an IBHC network that includes a registered bank in the U.S. Among
the banks with access, some also belong to non-German IBHCs. These are either German affiliates of U.S.-IBHCs (subgroup
c)), or affiliates of foreign, non-U.S. IBHCs (subgroup d)). The latter are banks of non-German BHCs, which accessed the
facilities through their U.S. affiliates. The subgroup of German banks with access can further be separated into heads of
IBHCs, and subsidiaries of IBHCs (e) and f)). The form of access to the facilities is different for these subgroups, as heads
have direct control over the U.S. subsidiaries (which accessed the facilities), while facility funds reach German subsidiaries
only through the head companies, thus indirectly. The actual number of banks included in the regressions may vary as the
panel is unbalanced and not all banks offer all types of products for which interest rates are observed.

to the mere existence of the emergency facilities rather than its actual usage. it
is a
bank×semi-annual fixed effect to account for unobserved bank-specific characteristics,
which may vary over time. This specification is crucial to minimize possible concerns
about confounding policy measures, such as unobserved liquidity facilities provided by
the European Central Bank (ECB) (see, for example, Acharya et al., 2015). Controlling
for such unobservables per bank-term in addition to observed monthly liquidity indica-
tors from prudential data, namely liquidity ratios and central bank liabilities, aids the
identification of the effect of U.S. facilities on interest rates in Germany.
This specification implies that the direct effect of having an AFFILIATEi
is sub-
sumed by the bank×semi-annual fixed effect since IBHCs did not retreat or entered the
U.S. market during the sample period. Likewise, the direct term for POSTm
is subsumed
by the monthly fixed effects. Whereas such a difference-in-difference approach therefore

permits the exact identification of the presence of affiliates, it does suffer from two lim-
itations. First, it neglects the intensity with which IBHCs have tapped the facilities,
thereby camouflaging cross-sectional heterogeneity across banks' actual usage of favor-
able U.S. funding conditions.9 Indeed, the data show significant changes in the amount
of borrowed funds, both across IBHCs and time. Second, although the establishment of
liquidity facilities signals a possible change in the policy stance ­ and may therefore be a
permanent shock to banks with access ­ some liquidity effects will be short-lived rather
than yielding a long-term and sustained reduction of banks' funding costs, which may or
may not be passed on to corporate credit customers in the form of lower loan rates.
As a second approach, we therefore take a closer look at the dynamics during the
`treatment period', i.e. we estimate a reduced form to explain observed interest rates
during the lifetime of the facilities with observed bank-specific usage of these facilities per
IBHC. Contrary to the first approach, we thus focus on the months between December
2007 and May 2010 when the facilities were in place to gauge any possible short-term
rate-setting effects. Table 2 reports the average monthly balance of all IBHCs that are
associated with banks on German soil in our data sample. These volumes are derived from
the individual facility usage reported in the Bloomberg data between December 2007 and
May 2010. All banks with access in our data sample used the various Fed lines at some
point in time during the lifetime of the emergency facilities. Furthermore, there is no
bank which gained or lost access to the funding due to a change in the IBHC structure.
We therefore examine the effect of emergency funding based on the different amounts
in facility usage, rather than changes in the access structure. On a monthly basis, we
estimate the impact on offered interest rates by a bank in Germany in a fixed-effect
regression framework, according to the following equation:
ri,m
= m
+ it
+ USAGEi,m
+ Xi,m-1
+ i,m
, (2)
where USAGEi,m
is the IBHC's outstanding balance across all emergency facilities
and the Discount Window as a share of total assets. We compute monthly balances

data sample.
11
outstanding as the average daily balance across all facilities and the Discount Window.
The USD balances are converted to EUR using the respective average monthly ECB
reference rate. The variable USAGE is the average monthly balance divided by the total
assets of the IBHC, multiplied by 100. Total assets of the IBHC are the consolidated
balance sheet totals of the highest ranking bank of the network in the sample, i.e. the
highest available consolidation level in our dataset. For German IBHCs, this equals the
total assets of the IBHC head company, which is always included in the sample. For non-
German IBHCs, this equals the total assets of the largest affiliate bank in the sample.10
USAGE thus represents the funds obtained in percentages of the respective IBHC's size,
thereby accounting for size differences of IBHCs with access to funding. Descriptive
statistics are available in Table 2.
3 Data sources and treatment validity
3.1 Emergency facilities
Detailed information on the amounts received from the Federal Reserve System by indi-
vidual IBHCs was made public by Bloomberg in 2011. The dataset provides a complete
account of all funds granted for each of the facilities and the Discount Window, as well as
aggregated data. Balances vis-`
a-vis the Federal Reserve are stated on a daily basis during
the entire lifetime of the facilities and are available at the IBHC level.
The dataset was released after Bloomberg L.P. had successfully filed a lawsuit against
the Board of the Federal Reserve on grounds of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in
November 2008. The FOIA gives U.S. citizens the right to access documents and related
information on the actions of the government. The Federal Reserve System had refused
to provide these information on grounds of the confidentiality of financial information,
which is generally excluded from the FOIA. In August 2009, the court ruled in favor of
Bloomberg. Despite several appeals by the Federal Reserve System, the data were even-
tually released in 2011 after the Supreme Court rejected the final appeal. Bloomberg
subsequently made the information available through its information network. Further-
more, complete data on the emergency funding facilities is also available through the
Federal Reserve's website.
3.2 Interest rates
We obtain monthly interest rates and new business volumes from the interest rate report
(Zinsstatistik) of Deutsche Bundesbank from January 2004 to December 2014. The re-
port is a mandatory survey of interest rates and business volumes of banks in Germany,
conducted on a monthly basis. The reporting banks are a representative sample of around
200 banks of the banking sector in Germany, with large banks regularly included and a
varying pool of smaller banks. The sample corresponds to approximately 10% of all banks
in Germany and covers more than 75% of aggregate banking assets in Germany.11
10For further robustness we exclude these banks from treatment in one of our alternative treatment definitions.
11The Zinsstatistik is reported for a stratified sample and includes representative proportions of all three main pillars of
the German banking system: Commercial, savings, and cooperative banks.
12
The complete report differentiates more than 50 categories of deposit and credit prod-
ucts. To represent an important share of overall banking activity, we focus on the most
frequently reported products for non-financial corporate clients, for short-term (< 1 year)
and long-term (> 2 or 5 years) maturities.12 From the perspective of the bank, this corre-
sponds to one asset side and one liability side product for each maturity category. Table 1
presents detailed descriptions of the variables. Clients are incorporated non-financial busi-
nesses, such as publicly listed or limited companies. Interest rates are reported as averages
for newly generated business during the reported month, and all rates are reported in per-
centages.
3.3 Control variables
We construct control variables from the monthly liquidity and balance sheet report of
Deutsche Bundesbank (Bilanzstatistik). For an overview of the control variables and
their exact definitions see Table 1. Bank Size is defined as ln(total assets) and captures
the differences in institution size, Leverage Ratio (share of total equity) accounts for the
differences in capitalization. Accounting for the differences in funding, Wholesale Funding
represents the share of securitized debt on the balance sheet, while Latent Liabilities
captures exposure to latent liabilities as a share of total assets.
Most importantly, we also control for monthly variation in available liquidity of each
bank. Liquidity is the share of net liquidity balances relative to total assets. The former
is obtained from prudential accounts in which banks indicate details about their assets
and liabilities with a maturity of up to 30 days. In addition, we specify Central Bank
Liabilities as net assets with the central bank of up to one year in maturity. Hence,
any cross-sectional differences among banks in the use of unobserved liquidity provision
other than the U.S. facilities investigated here should be gauged by these covariates. The
fact that the interest rates charged on U.S. liquidity facilities were lower compared to
the marginal lending facility of the ECB for the entire sample period (see Figure 2 in the
Online Appendix) further suggests that confounding monetary policy by, for example, the
ECB is adequately controlled for by these control variables in conjunction with the rich
set of fixed effects.
3.4 Descriptive statistics and treatment validity
Table 3 presents in the first two panels summary statistics for the dependent and control
variables in the treatment and the control group of the difference-in-difference sample
without the treatment period (December 2007 and April 2010) as well as the full sample
used in the reduced form estimation represented by Equation (2). Overall, the sample
comprises monthly data for 217 individual banks in Germany between January 2004 and
December 2014 (132 months). Banks in the treatment group were at some time between
December 2007 and April 2010 part of an IBHC with access to the emergency facilities.
The remaining banks form the control group (see Figure 5).
The financial products, for which we analyze loan pricing, are the most frequently
reported products in the interest report for corporate clients. Variations in the number
12We find no impact on medium-term interest rates or new business volumes and therefore focus on short-term and
long-term interest rates in the following.
13
of observations arise because not all banks regularly report values for all categories, ei-
ther because no new business was generated during a respective month or the respective
product is not part of the bank's business model. The minimum number of observations
is 6,600 (for long-term deposits), the maximum is 19,646 (for short-term credits).
The t-test for the equality of means confirms significant differences between the re-
ported rates and the control variables of the treatment and the control group. Banks in
the treatment group on average offer higher deposit rates, while simultaneously charging
higher credit rates in both samples, with and without the treatment period itself. We
later on confirm our results on a matched sample to further address a potential sampling
bias.
The bottom panel in Table 3, however, illustrates that prior to the inception of U.S.
emergency facility lines, neither interest rates on funding and lending nor bank traits
developed significantly differently. This parallel development of observable bank traits
bodes well for our objective to identify the effect of the policy rather than confounding it
with observable systematic differences already in place before the policy.
4 Results
4.1 Baseline results
Table 4 reports the baseline estimation results according to Equation (1) in columns (I)-
(IV) and Equation (2) in columns (V)-(VIII). Consider first short-term rate effects, the
primary target of unconventional monetary policy in the form of providing additional
liquidity lines, according to the difference-in-difference approach. Column (I) exhibits a
significantly negative effect of emergency facility usage on short-term deposit rates. The
differential impact on the short-term funding cost of banks in Germany with access to U.S.
liquidity via the internal capital market of the IBHC amounts to 12.5 basis points, which
is substantial given the sample's average short-term interest rate of 1.6% as it corresponds
to a decrease in short-term funding costs of around 7.8%.
This effect is confirmed for the sample that considers responses gauging the intensity
of USAGE during the disbursement period in column (V). The reduction of short-term
funding cost of banks in Germany with access to U.S. liquidity via the internal capital
market of their IBHC amounts to 2.3 basis points for each percent of emergency funding
per total IBHC assets. Given average short-term interest rates of 2.5%, this corresponds
to a reduction in short-term funding costs by around 1.1%.
Therefore, German banks with access to Fed liquidity facilities benefited, but the eco-
nomic magnitude of these benefits was relatively small. Yet, these statistically significant
effects are remarkable since they provide clear evidence for the international transmission
of unorthodox monetary policy on the cost of borrowing. Thereby, our micro evidence
complements macroeconomic studies concerning the domestic transmission of monetary
policy on the cost of borrowing (see, e.g., Gilchrist, L´
opez-Salido, and Zakraj´
sek, 2015)

Regression results for deposits and credits to non-financial corporations. The sample is composed of monthly data ranging
from January 2004 to December 2014 (132 months) . Columns (I)-(IV) present results for a difference-in-difference regression
comparing the period before the introduction of the facilities (before December 2007) to the period after the facilities (after
April 2010). AFFILIATE is a dummy variable equal to one if a bank's IBHC operates an affiliate bank in the U.S. and zero
otherwise, and POST is a dummy variable equal to one for the period after emergency funding has occurred (i.e. after April
2010) and zero otherwise. Columns (V)-(VIII) show regression results for the treatment period (December 2007 to April
2010) dependent on actual facility usage. USAGE is measured as Federal Reserve funds outstanding in percent of group
total assets and its descriptive statistics below the regression pertain to the period between December 2007 and April 2010.
Rates are average monthly interest rates on newly generated business in %. Short-term includes maturities of up to one
year, long-term deposits refer to maturities over two years, long-term credits to maturities over five years. Credits are all
credits of up to one million EUR in size. Control variables are Bank Size, given by ln(Total Assets), Leverage Ratio (Total

as well as bank-level studies documenting the effects of loan volume responses via inter-
national banks (as in Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012a; Schnabl, 2012).
Ideally, the reduction of funding costs of banks should also ease credit terms to cor-
porate customers, an objective presumably even more important to central banks than
easing funding pressure faced by banks per se. Columns (II) and (VI) show insignificant
effects for those banks with access to U.S. liquidity facilities. This result is in line with
Cycon and Koetter (2015), who find that the reduction of internal funding cost of a large
commercial bank in response to the ECB's Security Purchase Program (SMP) was passed
on to customer rates only in part. Instead, they show that interest margins earned by the
bank increase.
The remaining columns (III), (IV), (VII), and (VIII) in Table 4 show that banks with
access to U.S. facilities through the IBHC network do neither exhibit significantly different
long-term loan nor deposit rates. This result suggests that the emergency facilities in the
U.S. were able to relieve short-term pressure in credit and funding markets as intended.
But they had no differential effect on the long end of the yield curve faced by banks
operating in Germany. As such, internal capital markets of IBHCs appear to be of rele-
vance to transmit monetary policy internationally, but possibly unintended consequences
abroad for long term financing decisions appear to be limited, at least in other developed
economies such as the German one.
Since especially the short-run responses to emergency liquidity provisions appear to
be robust toward either identification scheme, we focus henceforth on the specification
represented by Equation (2) to investigate the responses of interest rate setting also during
the disbursement period between May 2007 and December 2010.
4.2 Lagged pass-through
The effect of access to U.S. liquidity facilities on funding and lending rates discussed above
assumes that any potential pass-through via internal capital markets of IBHCs occurs
instantaneously since we specify the usage by bank i contemporaneously. However, recent
studies investigating the effects of other unorthodox monetary policy on interest rates in
variants of a Vector Autoregression setting, such as Boeckx, Dossche, and Peersman (2015)
for the Eurozone, document lagged effects on interest rates in response to quantitative
easing of up to four quarters.
Therefore, Figure 6 shows estimated coefficients for USAGE according to Equation (2)
when we specify the scaled amount of used liquidity of each bank's IBHC with up to 12
lags, i.e. one year. These lags illustrate the response of banks' interest rates up to
12 months after facility usage. The negative effect on banks' funding cost in terms of
contracted corporate deposit rates by banks in Germany with access to U.S. liquidity
loses significance after two to three months. Importantly, we also find that short-term
customer credit rates exhibit a economically significant reduction due to access to U.S.
liquidity that is significantly different from zero for lags between two and four months.
This result highlights that unorthodox liquidity provision in the U.S. not only repre-
sented a funding advantage to internationally active banks, but also eased credit terms to
German corporates. The magnitudes of these effects are not statistically different from
each other. Any refunding advantages enjoyed by banks that are a member of an IBHC
with internal capital market access to the U.S. did not result in a competitive advantage
17

in terms of larger markups earned. As such, our results contradict indications in, for
example, Berger and Roman (2015) who find that U.S. banks subject to unconventional
support schemes, in this case TARP, provided recipient banks with more market market
power. One important explanation why we find little indication of why differential liq-
uidity assistance induces competitive distortions is that we consider only one portion of
a banks business, namely short-term corporate lending. Another reason might be that
both quantitative easing considered in Cycon and Koetter (2015) and Boeckx et al. (2015)
and outright equity support of banks as in Berger and Roman (2015) affect banks pricing
policies differently compared to liquidity assistance, which we investigate here.
The two graphs in the bottom panel of Figure 6 confirm, in turn, the absence of
any significant responses in long-run deposit and credit rates contracted with corporate
customers in Germany. Any impetus from liquidity assistance on the funding constraints
of banks and credit terms to the real sector therefore remains absent in our sample.
4.3 Treatment validity
4.3.1 Matched control group
An important requirement for valid inference in our empirical set-up is to ensure that the
comparison of rates on new deposits and loans by banks in Germany with and without
access to U.S. liquidity is not subject to confounding factors, such as the size of the bank
determining whether it operates a branch in the U.S. or not. Studies for the German
banking sector have shown that foreign markets are not entered randomly, but that only
few, fairly larger, productive, and profitable banks set up subsidiaries and branches abroad
(Buch et al., 2011a,b; Buch, Koch, and Koetter, 2014). A further possible concern may
be that it is exactly these banks that also experience additional inflows of deposits due to
implicit bail-out guarantees during crisis times (as e.g. described by Gatev, Schuermann,
and Strahan, 2009).13
And indeed, the descriptive statistics for the present sample of banks that report
interest rates to Bundesbank (Table 3) indicate significant differences with respect to
dependent and control variables between the treatment and control group.
To address resulting concerns about sample selection bias, we create a matched sample
based on propensity score matching following Caliendo and Kopeinig (2008). We match
each bank in the treatment group with its nearest neighbor in the control group and
subsequently drop all banks in the sample which cannot be matched or do not fulfill the
common support assumption. Subsequently, we re-estimate Equation (2) for the matched
sample and accordingly report results in Table 5.
To conserve on space, we only depict the coefficient of interest, namely the coefficient
for the aggregate usage of these facilities. The main result of a decrease in short-term
deposit rates remains significant at the 1% level and even increases in magnitude. The
result suggests a 13.5 basis point decrease per one percent in facility usage, corresponding
to an economically significant change of 4.4% in short-term deposit funding cost for the
average bank.
13Note that we do not find any changes in the volumes of deposits to corroborate this concern.

The sample is composed of monthly data ranging from December 2007 to April 2010 (29 months). Banks in the treatment

4.3.2 Random usage assignment
Next, we challenge our test design to define banks as treated depending on their usage
of U.S. liquidity facilities while these were in place and conduct two placebo treatment
tests. First, instead of the observed usage of facilities ranging between December 2007
and May 2010, we pre-date the timing of liquidity facilities by three years in Panel A of
Table 6.
The results are not significantly different from zero, thereby confirming that the esti-
mated negative relationship of short-term interest rates and the usage of bank i of a U.S.
facility in month m is not spurious.
But as Figure 1 illustrates the intensity of usage changed over time. Since it also
exhibits considerably variation across banks at any given moment in time, we assign
as a second placebo test the observed volumes of used facilities randomly across banks
during the time of treatment. The according results are shown in Panel B of Table 6 and
confirm as well the absence of differential effects on both short- and long-term interest rates
between banks in Germany with versus banks without access to U.S. liquidity facilities.
In sum, these results strongly support the validity of our approach to use a reduced
form estimation.
4.4 Facility support and pre-crisis ABCP exposure
The previous results indicate that the Federal Reserve emergency facilities were successful
in lowering short-term funding costs, and thus alleviated funding constraints in times of
financial turmoil. But did the significant amount of emergency funds reduce funding
constraints for those banks which were particularly affected by the crisis? Or was access
to the facilities used similarly by all banks, irrespective of crisis exposure?
To analyze if liquidity assistance access was larger for those banks with large pre-crisis
ABCP exposure, we specify an interaction model and show according results in Table 7.
Shedding light on the role of large pre-crisis ABCP exposures is particularly relevant in
our sample, because several banks based in Germany held very large amounts of ABCP.
Since this market was one of the first and most severely affected during the crisis, pre-crisis
ABCP approximate well how affected an IBHC was by the financial crisis.
Data on end-of-2006 exposure to ABCP are obtained from Acharya et al. (2014).
The dataset contains both the ABCP balance in billion USD, as well as the bank's corre-
sponding end-of-2006 total equity in billion USD. For the variable ABCP, the total ABCP
balance is divided by total equity. We divide this ratio by 1000 for better scaling as the
ABCP balance is relatively large compared to total equity. The resulting variable thus
measures the group's exposure in 1000 USD of ABCP per 1 USD of group equity. In case
of banks that later on belong to one IBHC, but are listed separately in the dataset, the
sum of outstanding ABCP is scaled with the sum of total equity.
The results for short-term rates confirm and corroborate our earlier findings that
funding cost of banks in Germany, which were able to use U.S. liquidity facilities exhibit

significantly lower deposit rates. Contrary to the baseline reports above, we now also find
a contemporaneous negative effect on short-term loans of corporates. The finding that
long-term rates charged to German corporations are not responding significantly to U.S.
liquidity provision is also confirmed.
But both the direct pre-crisis exposure to the ABCP market as well as the interaction
terms are mostly insignificant, the exception being a small positive coefficient estimated
for the effect on short-term deposit rates. To assess the effect of economic magnitude, we
show the total marginal effect. Figure 7 shows accordingly conditional marginal effects of
USAGE with respect to the four interest rates conditional on the distribution of ABCP
exposures across banks in Germany prior to the crisis.
Note, that the distribution of the ABCP variable is very skewed. The vast majority
of IBHC members in Germany had less than 1000 USD of ABCP exposure as a group
per 1 USD of group equity. Only a handful of banks were engaged more heavily in this
market, which highlights the importance to draw inference not only based on coefficients
estimated at the mean of the data.
The upper two panels of Figure 7 confirm that short-term deposit and loan rates
are significantly reduced. This effect is different from zero for the funding cost across
24
the entire ABCP distribution, but declines for those banks with the largest pre-crisis
exposures. Similarly, the reduction in short-term credit rates are significantly negative
up to around 1,500 USD of ABCP exposure per USD of group equity, but not for those
IBHC members with very large exposures. As such, the U.S. facilities certainly helped
to reduce short term loan rates, but customers of the most crisis-affected banks did not
benefit from this policy.
The bottom panels corroborate as well that long-term rates did not respond to liquidity
assistance across any degree of ABCP exposure.
4.5 Bank traits
Since the main purposes of the facilities was to ease the funding pressure for banks with
eminent shortage of liquidity, we also specify interactions models with observed liquidity
(Table 8) and leverage (Table 9). Figures 8 and 9 depict the associated total marginal
effects corresponding to these estimation results.
Emergency facilities exert their negative effect on short-term deposit rates across the
entire range of liquidity positions of German banks. In fact, those with the least binding
liquidity constraints reduced deposit rates the most, indicating a substitution of funding
from corporate customers with cheaper funds from U.S. emergency facilities. Indeed, a
comparison of ECB liquidity facilities with similar maturities compared to those U.S.
facilities investigated here shows that the cost of the former were lower throughout the
entire sample period (see Figure 1 in the Online Appendix).
Short-term credit rates are only significantly reduced though for those banks with
the lowest liquidity positions prior to the inception of the facilities. The transmission of
unconventional liquidity lines to corporate customers relied thus primarily on banks that
exhibited the worst financial conditions.
Figure 9 corroborates this qualification to the extent that only the least capitalized
banks exhibit the significantly negative effect of U.S. liquidity access on short term rates.
Consistent with the results in Jim´
enez, Ongena, Peydr´
o, and Saurina (2014), additional
liquidity appears to be routed to the corporate sector in particular by the weakest banks
in the system.

We consider four alternative differential effects, for which we represent results in the

4.6.1 The impact of savings banks
The special type of savings banks is an important feature of the German banking land-
scape. Here, we employ an alternative treatment definition to determine in how far the
network between savings banks and Landesbanken accounts for our previously reported
results. In deviation from our baseline identification, we therefore treat all savings banks
in our sample as independent from their Landesbank's IBHC and assume that regional
savings banks have no longer access to U.S. funding facilities and are thus part of the
control group.
The results in Panel A of Table 10 clearly illustrate that our results are not driven by
the relatively large number of regional savings banks that we consider as supported by
U.S. liquidity facilities via their Landesbank. We continue to estimate a contemporaneous
reduction of deposit rates in response to the usage of U.S. facilities by 2.2 basis points,
which is very close to the estimated baseline effect.
In Panel B we tackle concerns that similarly to regional savings banks, local cooper-
ative banks might also be subject to implicit or even explicit liquidity backstops by the
central head institutions (DZ and WGZ Bank), which in turn might have routed tapped
U.S. liquidity. The result clearly shows that all effects remain intact even when treating
all cooperative banks as supported.
4.6.2 The impact of large banks
Several banks in our sample are especially large commercial banks or serve as central
institutions with special tasks for savings and cooperative banks. As such, they play
a prominent role in the market and may strongly affect our results. Therefore, we ex-
clude these large banks in Table 11 to report the effects of emergency facility support
independent of these institutions. The interaction term remains significantly negative for
short-term deposits whereas the absence of significant effects for short-term credit rates as
well as any long-term rates is also confirmed. This result therefore strongly suggests that
internal capital markets are an important channel through which in particular smaller
banks might benefit from additional liquidity tapped by U.S. members of the IBHC.
4.6.3 Effect on German IBHC banks
Figure 5 highlights the numerous possible alternatives how to define IBHC and thus access
to U.S. liquidity via internal capital markets. Our previous results were obtained under
the assumption that both affiliates of German IBHCs and affiliates of non-German IBHCs
were equally affected by transfers of supporting funds through internal capital markets.
But De Haas and Van Horen (2012) provide evidence that internal capital markets during
crisis may favor home country banks. Therefore foreign banks with access to funding
may not be affected in the same way and distort our results. In the following analysis
we exclude these banks (all banks in subsamples c) and d)) in Figure 5) from our data
sample. The results in Panel A of Table 12 confirm the baseline reduction of short-term
deposit rates.
We further show the difference in impact between German and non-German IBHC
banks among the subsample of all banks with access to the U.S. emergency funding
support (subsamples b), c) and d) in Figure 5) in Table 12, Panel B. Using the original
30
baseline regression approach, we redefine our treatment variable USAGE to represent
the scale of funding received for German IBHC banks only, and zero for all other banks.
Whereas the estimated coefficients indicate qualitatively identical results compared to
the baseline, the exclusion of two affiliates of U.S. IBHCs and six affiliates of other than
German or U.S. IBHCs prohibit the precise estimation of these effects.
4.6.4 Effect on German IBHC heads
U.S. funding support possibly had an even stronger effect on head companies of German
IBHCs with an affiliate in the U.S. Unlike the other banks in the IBHC, they have direct
control over the U.S. affiliate, and therefore a more direct access to the provided liquidity.
We therefore restrict our banks with access to the heads of German IBHCs (subsample
e) in Figure 5) and analyze the effect compared to the original control group in Table
13, Panel A. Results support our baseline findings, with both increased significance and
magnitude for short-term rates. This suggests that German IBHC heads lowered their
short-term deposit rates and short-term rates by more than their respective subsidiaries,
indicating that they exert more control over the received liquidity.
In analogy, we restrict our sample in Panel B to all banks of German IBHCs with
affiliates in the U.S. to analyze the difference in impact between direct funding access
(heads) and indirect access (subsidiaries). The new sample consists of subsamples e) and
f) in Figure 5. The variable USAGE in this context remains the share of funds obtained for
head companies, and is zero for subsidiaries. The coefficient of interest is then significantly
negative, indicating that direct access to U.S. facilities relative to indirect access yields
statistically significant responses in terms of corporate deposit rates. Possibly, internal
capital markets are less efficient in re-allocating liquidity compared to the possibility of
more direct transfers.
4.7 Further robustness of results
Next to the arguably critical definition of which banks had access to U.S. emergency
facilities, we conducted a number of further robustness tests that are available in the
Online Appendix. We briefly summarize the main upshots here.
An important confounding factor in explaining interest rate setting, next to liquid-
ity provisions, might be unobserved differences in credit and deposit demand that banks
face in regional markets. We therefore also specified regional unemployment as well as
state×quarter fixed effects to gauge such unobservable factors. Results remain qualita-
tively identical.
Next, we exclude one-by-one large banks from the commercial, the savings bank,
and the cooperative bank sector, respectively, because these IBHCs themselves might be
driving the results. We also exclude all pairs of two from these large banking groups. In
both tests, the results remain qualitatively identical.
5 Conclusions
We test if the usage of U.S. emergency facilities that were available to affiliates of for-
eign banks between December 2007 until April 2010 were transmitted via internal capital
31
markets of international bank holding companies (IBHC), thereby affecting interest rate
setting outside the U.S. banking market. To test for this international interest rate trans-
mission, we combine detailed data about which banks used which type of U.S. liquidity
assistance to what extent for how long that was released by the Federal Reserve System
in 2011, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) ruling in favour of the press
network Bloomberg L.P. We hand-collect for banks that used the Fed liquidity support
lines their connection to IBHCs that also operated banks in Germany. For this market,
detailed information on the monthly pricing of new lending and deposit taking is reported
by a representative sample of banks to the German central bank since January 2004.
We use a difference-in-difference set-up to compare whether banks with access to
U.S. liquidity through the internal capital markets of their IBHC passed more favorable
funding conditions at the group level on to their German operations. We find that short-
term deposit rates exhibit a significant, contemporaneous decline in response to the usage
of U.S. liquidity facilities compared to German banks without access to these funding
sources. Short-term credit rates do not decline contemporaneously, but decline with a lag
of two to four months. Thus, unorthodox U.S. monetary policy did not only succeed in
reducing funding pressure in the U.S., but also helped to alleviate such constraints abroad
in a large, developed banking system like Germany.
We do not find any evidence of a response in long-term rates, neither on deposits from
nor loans demanded by German corporate customers. This result indicates that U.S.
liquidity assistance did not reduce long-term risk premia outside the home market.
These results are also confirmed when considering banks with particularly large U.S.
funding pressure due to large pre-crisis ABCP market exposures, matched samples of
banks without access to U.S. liquidity assistance via internal capital markets, alternative
random treatment allocation schemes, as well as four variants of how to define membership
in an IBHC.
In sum, our results support the view that unorthodox monetary policy in the form of
emergency liquidity assistance in the U.S. also transmitted via internal capital markets of
IBHCs to other developed markets, and helped to alleviate short-term funding pressure.
