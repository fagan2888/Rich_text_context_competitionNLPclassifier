OBJECTIVE -- To describe sexual activity, behavior, and problems among middle-age and
older adults by diabetes status.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- This was a substudy of 1,993 community-
residing adults, aged 57­85 years, from a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample (N 
3,005). In-home interviews, observed medications, and A1C were used to stratify by diagnosed
diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, or no diabetes. Logistic regression was used to model associa-
tions between diabetes conditions and sexual characteristics, separately by gender.
RESULTS -- The survey response rate was 75.5%. More than 60% of partnered individuals
with diagnosed diabetes were sexually active. Women with diagnosed diabetes were less likely
than men with diagnosed diabetes (adjusted odds ratio 0.28 [95% CI 0.16­0.49]) and other
women (0.63 [0.45­0.87]) to besexually active. Partnered sexual behaviors did not differ by gender
or diabetes status. The prevalence of orgasm problems was similarly elevated among men with
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes compared with that for other men, but erectile difficulties
were elevated only among men with diagnosed diabetes (2.51 [1.53 to 4.14]). Women with
undiagnosed diabetes were less likely to have discussed sex with a physician (11%) than women
with diagnosed diabetes (19%) and men with undiagnosed (28%) or diagnosed (47%) diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS -- Many middle-age and older adults with diabetes are sexually active and
engage in sexual behaviors similarly to individuals without diabetes. Women with diabetes were
more likely than men to cease all sexual activity. Older women with diabetes are as likely to have
sexual problems but are significantly less likely than men to discuss them.

Advances in treatment for diabetes
have prolonged and improved
quality of life for many of the 12
million affected individuals aged 60
years in the U.S. Clinical guidelines for
diabetes care include assessment and
treatment of erectile problems in men (1).
Sexual problems may be a warning sign of
diabetes or a consequence that can lead to
depression, lack of adherence to treat-
ment, and strained intimate relationships.
In contrast, older women's sexual issues
have been largely overlooked in screening
for and treating diabetes (1,2). Failure to
recognize and address sexual issues
among middle-aged and older adults with
diabetes may impair quality of life and
adaptation to the disease.
Some adults with diabetes maintain
sexual relationships throughout their
lives (3). Prior studies have focused on the
pathophysiological effects of diabetes on
male sexual function, primarily erection
and sexual desire. The effects of diabetes
on women's sexual functioning are poorly
understood and probably multifactorial
(2). Sexual problems in adults with dia-
betes have been associated with age, dis-
ease duration, and comorbidity (1). The
effects of chronic hyperglycemia, degree
of diabetes control, or use of glucose-
lowering drugs are less clear (4), in part
because individuals with undiagnosed or
preclinical diabetes are typically aggre-
gated with control subjects in other stud-
ies (1). Psychosocial correlates of sexual
problems in individuals with diagnosed
diabetes have been found in younger
adults. Studies including older adults find
associations with depression (1), vulner-
ability, lifestyle restrictions due to disease
management (5), and marital conflict (6).
Prior data on sexuality in individuals
with diabetes were derived primarily
from studies that are small, have not in-
cluded very old individuals or aggregated
individuals 65 years, lacked a compar-
ison group, and relied on convenience or
other nongeneralizable samples (1,2).
Comprehensive, population-based data
are needed to further physicians' under-
standing of the sexual norms and prob-
lems of older adults with diagnosed and
undiagnosed diabetes. Virtually nothing
is known about sexual function among
individuals with undiagnosed diabetes;
this information could be relevant for di-
agnosis, motivation to engage in treat-
ment, and prevention of sexual and
nonsexual diabetes-related complica-
tions. The National Social Life, Health

and Aging Project (NSHAP) provides dis-
ease-specific data on the sexual activity,
behaviors, and problems of middle-aged
and older adults affected by diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NSHAP involved a na-
tionally representative probability sample
of community-dwelling adults aged
57­84 years (at the time of screening),
generated from U.S. households screened
in 2004, described in detail elsewhere (7).
Of 4,017 eligible subjects in the sample,
3,005 (1,455 men and 1,550 women)
were interviewed at home between July
2005 and March 2006, yielding a
weighted response rate of 75.5% (un-
weighted 74.8%). The protocol was ap-
proved by the University of Chicago and
NORC institutional review boards; all
respondents gave written informed
consent.
Demographic and sexuality data
Details of demographic and sexuality
measures have been reported previously
(3). Sex was defined as "any mutually vol-
untary activity with another person that
involves sexual contact, whether or not
intercourse or orgasm occurs." Sexually
active respondents were asked about the
presence of sexual problems selected on
the basis of diagnostic and clinical criteria
for sexual dysfunction (3). All respon-
dents who had not had sex in the previous
3 months were asked to indicate why
from a list of reasons (3). A self-
administered questionnaire completed
during the in-home interview asked
about the frequency of masturbation, de-
fined as "stimulating your genitals (sex or-
gans) for sexual pleasure, not with a sex
partner," and ascertained whether orgasm
occurred with masturbation. Questions
about sexual activity and problems were
refused by 2­7% of respondents; 12­13%
declined to answer the questions regard-
ing masturbation.
Diabetes status classification
Individuals were classified as having "di-
agnosed diabetes," regardless of their A1C
value, if they responded that they had
been told by a physician that they had
diabetes or if they were using one or more
diabetes medications. To identify individ-
uals with "undiagnosed diabetes," we
used an A1C cut point of 6.0% based on
the correlation of A1C with the traditional
fasting glucose criterion in older individ-
uals. This A1C cut point for identifying
undiagnosed diabetes was selected based
on a sensitivity/specificity analysis of data
from the 1999 ­2004 U.S. National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
for individuals aged 57­85 (8). By com-
paring different A1C cut points with di-
agnosis of diabetes based on fasting
glucose levels, an A1C cut point of 6.0%
maximized specificity of the assay for de-
tecting undiagnosed diabetes without
compromising sensitivity for all cut
points examined between 5.0 and 7.0%
(specificity 0.91 for men and 0.91 for
women; sensitivity 0.68 for men and 0.69
for women) (supplementary Fig. 1, avail-
able in an online appendix at http://care.
diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc10-
0524/DC1). Individuals who did not have
diagnosed diabetes were classified as hav-
ing "no diabetes" if their A1C value was
6.0% and were classified as having "un-
diagnosed diabetes" if their A1C value
was 6.0% (supplementary Fig. 1A). In
light of recent changes in international di-
abetes care guidelines, we also performed
sensitivity analyses using the A1C 6.5%
cut point criterion and summarize these
in the DISCUSSION (9,10).
Details of medication data collection
by direct observation and medication
classification and coding have been de-
scribed previously (11). Sixteen percent
of all individuals and 26% of those in the
analytic sample (17 and 24% weighted,
respectively) were taking at least one
medication classified as an antidiabetic
agent "on a regular schedule, like every
day or every week." These agents (and the
weighted proportion of individuals in the
analytic sample taking them) included bi-
guanides (13.9%), sulfonylureas
(12.5%), thiazolidinediones (7.2%), in-
sulin (5%), antidiabetes combinations
(2.6%), meglitinides (0.7%), -glucosi-
dase inhibitors (0.3%), and miscella-
neous antidiabetes agents (0.1%). Of all
the individuals using one or more diabe-
tes medications, 95.1% also reported a di-
abetes diagnosis. Of individuals classified
as having diagnosed diabetes, 3.9% were
classified on the basis of medication data
alone.
Measurement of A1C
Fingerstick dried blood specimens were
sought from a random two-thirds of study
respondents (n  2,494), with a cooper-
ation rate of 84.4% (n  2,105) (supple-
mentary Fig. 2B, available in an online
appendix). A1C was obtained using well-
validated dried blood spot methods de-
scribed previously (12,13). Adequate
specimens were obtained for analysis
from 1,746 respondents.
Measurement of other health
conditions and physician
communication
Physical health was self-rated using the
5-point "excellent," "very good," "good,"
"fair," or "poor" scale. Comorbidities were
assessed using the Katz modification of
the Charlson index (14) (diabetes ex-
cluded), and activities of daily living were
assessed using the Katz Activities of Daily
Living Scale (15). Respondents were
asked whether a medical doctor had ever
told them they had any of several com-
mon diabetes-related complications (Ta-
ble 1). Communication with a physician
about sexual matters since age 50 was as-
sessed as described previously (3). De-
pressive symptoms were assessed using
the 11-item short form of the Center for
Epidemiological Studies-Depression
(CES-D) index (16), with response op-
tions 0­3; a score 9 was considered in-
dicative of a clinically significant level of
depressive symptoms, consistent with a
threshold of 16 on the 20-item scale (17).
Data analysis
The analytic sample consisted of the
1,993 participants for whom diabetes sta-
tus could be determined based on A1C,
medication data, and/or self-report (sup-
plementary Fig. 2A).
Demographic and clinical character-
istics were estimated separately within
each of the three diabetes status groups by
gender. Bivariate associations with diabe-
tes status were tested using the Rao and
Scott (18) correction to the 2 test to ac-
count for the survey design. Logistic re-
gression was used to model associations
between diabetes conditions and sexual
activity, behavior, and problems sepa-
rately by gender.
All models were adjusted for age-
group (57­64, 65­74, and 75­85 years),
depressive symptoms (CES-D scores 9
vs. 9), and the modified Charlson co-
morbidity index (0, 1­2, and 3) except
for outcomes with too few individuals in
either outcome category to support a fully
adjusted model (19). Education and race
were also evaluated as potential con-
founders of the effect of diabetes status.
For outcomes with a small number of in-
dividuals in either outcome category,
confounding effects of each covariate
listed above were evaluated separately;
unadjusted models are presented for
these outcomes unless confounding, de-

RESULTS
Sociodemographic and health
characteristics by diabetes status
Table 1 summarizes the demographic and
health characteristics of the analytic sam-
ple, stratified by diabetes status. Self-rated
health and capacity for activities of daily
living were consistently lower, and the
prevalence of several diabetes complica-
tions and comorbidities were consistently
higher for individuals with diagnosed di-
abetes compared with those with no dia-
betes, with intermediate results for those
with undiagnosed diabetes.
Partnership and sexual activity by
diabetes status
Men, regardless of age or diabetes status,
were more likely than women to be mar-
ried or living with a partner (Table 1) and
were significantly more likely than
women to be currently sexually active
(Table 2). Sixty-one percent of men (69%
of partnered men) and 33% of women
(62% of partnered women) with diag-
nosed diabetes were currently sexually
active. Women with diagnosed diabetes
were less likely than men with diagnosed
diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.28
[95% CI 0.16­0.48]) and other women
(0.63 [0.45­0.87]) to be sexually active.
Among sexually active individuals, the
majority engaged in sexual activity at least
two to three times per month and neither
the frequency of sexual activity nor spe-
cific partnered sexual behaviors differed
by diabetes status or gender.
Sexual behaviors and problems by
diabetes status
Among sexually active individuals,
partnered sexual behaviors did not dif-
fer by gender or diabetes status (Table
2). However, adults with diagnosed di-
abetes were less likely than others to

0.78 for women] 0.66 [0.44­0.97 for
men]) and to experience orgasm with
masturbation (Table 3).
Sexual problems were ascertained
only for individuals who were sexually ac-
tive in the prior 12 months (Table 3). Men
with diagnosed diabetes were more likely
than other men to report lack of interest in
sex (AOR 1.72 [95% CI 1.12­2.63]);
among women, interest in sex did not dif-
fer by diabetes status. The prevalence of
orgasm problems (inability to climax or
climaxing too quickly) was similarly ele-
vated among men with diagnosed and un-
diagnosed diabetes compared with men
without diabetes, but erectile difficulties
were elevated only among men with a di-
abetes diagnosis (2.52 [1.53­4.14]).
Among all individuals who had not
been sexually active for 3, men with di-
agnosed diabetes were more likely than all
other groups (men and women) to report
that they had not had sex because of their
own physical health problems (60.9 vs.
34.5% for men with undiagnosed diabe-
tes and 39.4% for men with no diabetes,
P  0.001; 16.2% of women with diabe-
tes vs. 8.5% with undiagnosed diabetes
and 9.2% with no diabetes). Among
women, the common reasons for sexual
inactivity were similar between those with
diagnosed and no diabetes, but women
with undiagnosed diabetes were more
likely to report lack of interest as a reason
for sexual inactivity (54.5% for undiag-
nosed diabetes vs. 44.9% for diagnosed
diabetes and 38.0% for no diabetes, P 
0.05).
Communication with a physician
about sexual issues by diabetes
status
Men with diagnosed diabetes were more
than twice as likely (46.8%) as women
with diagnosed diabetes (18.8%) to dis-
cuss sex with a physician compared with
28.0% of men and only 11.3% of women
with undiagnosed diabetes (supplemen-
tary Fig. 3A and B, available in an online
appendix). Among those who had dis-
cussed sexual matters with a physician,
16.7% of men overall (10.0% of men with
diagnosed diabetes) compared with
30.5% of women overall (28.4% of
women with diagnosed diabetes) re-
ported that the physician initiated the
conversation. Approximately one-third of
sexually active men and women with sex-
ual problems reported avoiding sex be-
cause of problems (Table 3); this number
did not vary by diabetes status.
CONCLUSIONS -- Our findings,
based on nationally representative U.S.
data, indicate that two-thirds of men and
approximately one-third of women aged
57­85 years with diabetes were sexually
active. Although diabetes was associated
with a higher rate of sexual inactivity,
those who were active participated in
partnered sexual behaviors and activity at
a rate similar to that of those without di-
abetes. As a group, the majority of indi-
viduals with diabetes were married or
living with a partner, although women
with diabetes were more likely to be
alone. Sexually active adults with diabetes
had a similar prevalence of sexual prob-
lems, and women were more likely than
men to avoid sex because of these prob-
lems. However, fewer than one in five
women with diagnosed diabetes com-
pared with nearly half of men had dis-
cussed sex with a physician. Individuals
with undiagnosed diabetes, particularly
women, were even less likely than others
to have discussed sex with a physician.
In this study, we combined self-
report measures, medication, and biolog-
ical measures from a population-based
probability sample to stratify individuals
as having diagnosed, undiagnosed, or no
diabetes. There is not yet full agreement
about using A1C to diagnose diabetes in
older adults (9,10,20), but our strategy
generated estimated prevalences of diag-
nosed and undiagnosed diabetes compa-
rable to 2005­2006 U.S. population
estimates using fasting plasma glucose
and/or oral glucose tolerance testing for
community-residing individuals aged
60 years (among those with A1C re-
sults, 20.5% [95% CI 17.5­24%] of 901
women and 25% [21­29%] of 843 men
had diagnosed diabetes, whereas 19%
[16­22%] of women and 22% [19­25%]
of men had undiagnosed diabetes) (21).
Repetition of the analyses shown here us-
ing a 6.5% glycosylated hemoglobin
threshold for diabetes classification in this
population yielded few qualitative differ-
ences in the outcomes of interest but did
result in a far smaller undiagnosed dia-
betic group (4.7% in women and 5.6% in
men) than found by classification based
on traditional diagnostic criteria. Using
either threshold, as a group, individuals
with undiagnosed diabetes are different
from those with diagnosed diabetes in
two important ways. First, those with un-
diagnosed diabetes seemed to be earlier in
the course of the disease. Second, undiag-
nosed diabetes is a pathophysiological
state that lacks the psychological burden
and/or social stigma associated with hav-
ing diagnosed diabetes (5).
The etiology of sexual problems as-
sociated with undiagnosed diabetes
(controlling for other physical and psy-
chological factors known to be associated
with sexual problems) might reflect a pre-
dominant physiological mechanism
whereas the etiology of sexual problems
associated with diagnosed diabetes might
be more likely to have an additional, dia-
betes-specific psychosocial component.
Although cross-sectional data cannot de-
termine the causal direction of such rela-
tionships, understanding the sexuality of
individuals with undiagnosed compared
with that of those with diagnosed and no
diabetes can shed light on the pathological
mechanisms and the natural history of both
diabetes and sexual dysfunction in later life.
In this study, aside from the expected
higher prevalence of erectile dysfunction
in men with diagnosed diabetes (55%)
(1), the prevalence of many sexual prob-
lems did not differ significantly according
to diabetes status. Dropping out from sex-
ual activity may partly explain the lack of
a diabetes association with sexual prob-
lems, especially in women. This finding is
suggested by the significantly higher
prevalence of sexual inactivity among
women with diagnosed diabetes com-
pared with that for men and a greater lack
of interest in sex among sexually inactive
women with diabetes compared with
those without. Furthermore, women with
diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed)
were nearly half as likely as other women
to report masturbating, suggesting a re-
duction in sexual drive that was indepen-
dent of partner status and of knowledge of
the disease. The prevalence of masturbation
was also lower in men with diagnosed or
undiagnosed diabetes compared with that
in men without but was three times higher
than in women with diabetes (45%).
Interestingly, the rate of erectile dys-
function was not markedly elevated in
men with undiagnosed diabetes (36 vs.
32% in men without diabetes), but the
inability to experience orgasm was high
and comparable to that of men with diag-
nosed diabetes (29 vs. 16% in men with-
out diabetes). This finding suggests that
loss of orgasmic function may not only
occur as a consequence of erectile dys-
function as described by others (22) but
also may actually precede erectile dys-
function, at least as perceived by some
men with diabetes. In women, inability to
experience orgasm with masturbation
was also significantly higher among those

*All odds ratios are adjusted for age-group, comorbidities, and depression unless otherwise noted. The unadjusted model was used because of the small number of cases. Model adjusted for age-group and race.
§Model adjusted for Charlson index and race. Respondents were asked about this activity or behavior if they reported having sex in the previous 12 months ¶This question was asked only of respondents who reported
at least one sexual problem. #Association with diabetes status was significant at P  0.05. **This question was asked of all respondents by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Answer options included never,
rarely, and sometimes. It was asked of everyone who reported masturbation, not exclusively of those who were sexually active. Odds ratio was significant at P  0.05.
Sexuality and diabetes

with diagnosed diabetes. Physicians who
do ask about sexual function tend to en-
gage patients with partners (23) and focus
on male erectile issues for which treat-
ment is readily available. Asking about or-
gasm function in relation to partnered sex
and masturbation and expanding these
discussions to include women may assist
in prevention of downstream sexual
problems and personal and interpersonal
distress and in earlier diagnosis of diabe-
tes in some individuals. Although no
pharmacological treatment is approved as
a remedy for anorgasmia, interventions
such as education to inform the patient
that anorgasmia is known to occur for a
substantial proportion of sexually active
individuals with diabetes, directed mas-
turbation, use of a clitoral pump in
women, and discussion of ways to en-
hance sexual arousal and intimacy can be
therapeutic.
Medications are another important
iatrogenic etiology of later-life sexual
problems (24). Glucose-lowering medi-
cations are largely thought to improve
sexual function by mitigating glycemic-
related microvascular damage, as seen in
clinical studies of erectile function in men
with diabetes (4). The stratification strat-
egy used in our study classifies all individ-
uals taking glucose-lowering medications
as having diagnosed diabetes. This strat-
egy would tend to underestimate the as-
sociation between diagnosed diabetes and
sexual function, particularly for the sub-
group with uncontrolled diabetes. How-
ever, other medications used to treat
diabetes, including antihypertensive and
cholesterol-lowering drugs, may have
deleterious effects on sexual function
(24). Because of sample size, this study is
limited by an inability to account for the
effects of other medications in estimating
the association between diabetes status
and aspects of sexuality. Prospective clin-
ical trials are needed to fully elucidate the
effects and interactions of medications on
sexual activity and function among mid-
dle-age and older adults with diabetes;
virtually nothing is documented about
the effects of diabetes medications on sex-
uality in older women.
The prevalence of specific sexual
problems was only assessed for those who
were sexually active in the prior 12
months, therefore underestimating the
prevalence of sexual problems in this
population. Next, in addition to the ex-
pected differences in population preva-
lence estimates for undiagnosed diabetes,
reanalysis using a glycosylated hemoglo-
bin cut point criterion of 6.5% results in
differences between the groups for some
outcomes, in part because of loss of pre-
cision in estimates. For example, the rate
of erectile dysfunction was still higher in
men with undiagnosed diabetes (40.5%)
compared with that of men without dia-
betes (32.1%), but the AOR comparing
these two groups was no longer signifi-
cant (0.63 [95% CI 0.25­1.58]). No sub-
stantive differences were found in
diabetes status comparisons among socio-
demographic, health, or communication
variables. As with virtually all clinical and
population-based research on human
sexuality, these data were self-reported,
although the interview methods are
widely accepted as being valid (25). Use
of a population-based probability sample
adds to prior knowledge (1,2) about later-
life diabetes and sexuality by disaggregat-
ing individuals with undiagnosed or
preclinical diabetes from those with no
diabetes. This study builds on prior work
by filling a void of information about
older women's sexuality and gender dif-
ferences in sexuality among middle-age
and older adults with diabetes. Further
research should be powered to also look
at age-group comparisons.
In conclusion, many middle-aged
and older adults with diabetes are sexu-
ally active. Sexual problems are common
but are infrequently discussed with phy-
sicians, especially among women. Physi-
cian knowledge about sexuality in
relation to diabetes should improve pa-
tient education and counseling, as well as
the identification of symptoms that could
signal undiagnosed disease or a high risk
for disease. Attention to potentially treat-
able sexual problems in middle-aged and
older adults with diabetes should im-
prove quality of life and enhance overall
diabetes management.
