Objective: To examine predictors and time trends of obesity in pre-school children in China.
Design: This study was based on data from China Health and Nutrition Survey, a longitudinal survey from 1989 to 1997.
Subjects: For cross-sectional analysis, we included 944, 1058, 903 and 483 children aged 2 ­ 6 y in 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1997,
respectively. For longitudinal analysis, we included 944 children and 3146 measurements during four time periods.
Measures: Overweight and obesity according to age- and sex-specific BMI cut-off points proposed by International Obesity Task
Force.
Results: The overall prevalence of obesity increased from 4.2% in 1989 to 6.4% in 1997 among children aged 2 ­ 6 y. The
increase largely occurred in urban areas, where the prevalence of obesity increased from 1.5% in 1989 to 12.6% in 1997 and
prevalence of overweight increased from 14.6 to 28.9% at the same period. Longitudinal analysis shows BMI increased by
0.2 kg=m2 per year in urban areas and 0.1 kg=m2 per year in rural areas. In multivariate analysis, overweight in early childhood
(2 ­ 6 y), parental overweight, high income and urban areas independently predicted overweight at age 10 ­ 14 y.
Conclusion: A substantial increase in overweight and obesity among children aged 2 ­ 6 y was observed in urban areas in China
from 1989 to 1997. Overweight in early childhood significantly predicted overweight during adolescence. Urgent public health
strategies are needed to prevent childhood obesity in China.

Introduction
Marked increases in the prevalence of overweight and obe-
sity have been observed in the last few decades in both
adults1 ­ 3 and children4 ­ 8 worldwide. Obesity is a major
risk factor for coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension
and certain types of cancer.9 ­ 13 Obesity in childhood is also
associated with high prevalence of elevated blood pressure,
diabetes, respiratory disease and orthopedic and psychoso-
cial disorders.14 ­ 18 The most significant long-term conse-
quence of childhood obesity is its persistence into
adulthood, along with all the associated health risks.19
With rapid growing economy and changing lifestyles in
China, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is increas-
ing rapidly in adults.20 However, to date, there is little
information on the extent of obesity among children in
China. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine time
trends of childhood obesity in China.
Subjects and methods
China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) design
The CHNS is a collaborative project of the Institute of
Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. The first wave of the CHNS data were collected in 1989,
and subsequently in 1991, 1993 and 1997 (www.cpc.unc.
edu=china=home).
The CHNS covered eight provinces (Guangxi, Guizhou,
Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shangdong
provinces in 1989, 1991 and 1993; Liaoning was replaced
by Heilongjiang in 1997) that vary substantially in geogra-
phy, economic development, public resources and health

draw the sample surveyed in each of the provinces. Detailed
information on the survey design and operation was
described elsewhere.21 ­ 23
Study population and measurements
Because Liangning province was replaced by Heilongjiang
province in 1997, in order to keep the data comparable, we
only analyzed data from the other seven provinces (exclud-
ing Liangning and Heilongjiang provinces) in this study.
Cross-sectional analysis included 944, 1058, 903 and 483
children in 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1997, respectively, aged 2 ­
6 y in each survey year. The 944 children in 1989 and 3146
measurements were used in the longitudinal analysis. These
included 944, 800, 762 and 640 children in 1989, 1991, 1993
and 1997, respectively. In all, 570 (60.4%) children were
measured four times, and 863 (91.4%) subjects were mea-
sured at least twice. The 692 children who had measure-
ments in both 1989 and 1997 were included in the
predicting analyses.
Of the detailed household and individual data collected,
the most relevant for this study are the demographic data,
physical examination data (including height and weight),
and socioeconomic factors (including household income,
parents' education and other related data). The anthropome-
trical measurements were carried out by trained health work-
ers following standard protocol. Body weight was measured
in light indoor clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg with a beam
balance scale. Height was measured without shoes to the
nearest 0.1 cm, using a portable stadiometer.
Definition of childhood overweight and obesity
To define childhood overweight and obesity, we used age-
and sex-specific BMI (body mass index) cut-off points pro-
posed by international obesity task force (IOTF), which
correspond to BMI of 25 and 30 kg=m2, respectively, at 18 y
old.24 The IOTF references are provided only for 6 month
intervals. To provide a more precise fit, we used a polynomial
approach to fit the BMI cut-off points for overweight and
obesity against the ages of the boys and girls. Each curve had
an almost perfect fit (r2 > 0.9999, and the sum of squared
residuals was < 0.03). An advantage of using the predicted
values was that we could use ages rounded to 0.1 y.25
Data analyses
First, we conducted cross-sectional analyses among children
aged 2 ­ 6 y in each survey year to examine the time trends in
body composition (including height, weight, BMI) and rates
of overweight and obesity by sex and region. To correct for
changes in the age distribution over time, the results were
age-adjusted by the direct method based on the total sample
of the four surveys.
Second, we conducted longitudinal analyses to examine
time trends in BMI, overweight and obesity among 944
children aged 2 ­ 6 y in 1989, and followed-up in 1991,
1993 and 1997. The analyses were conducted using general-
ized estimation equation (GEE) implemented in Proc
Genmod procedure in SAS.26 In the models, we included
the following covariables: age, height, gender, region (urban,
rural), parental overweight (at least one parent with BMI
! 23 kg=m2), mother's education, household income
(divided into tertiles: low, median, high) and child's baseline
weight (normal, overweight). We tested interactions between
time and region, gender, parental overweight and child's
baseline weight to examine the different trends among
different sub-populations.
Finally, we used logistic regression to predict overweight
status in 1997 using variables assessed in 1989. These vari-
ables included age, gender, region, parental overweight,
child's overweight at baseline and household income.
Results
Cross-sectional analyses of childhood obesity among
children aged 2 ­ 6 y
The distributions of age, gender and place of residence across
time for children aged 2 ­ 6 y are shown in Table 1. There
were no systematic changes in the proportion of boys or
girls. However, the proportion of children in rural areas
increased slightly from 73.2% in 1989 to 78.1% in 1997.
The distribution of age shifted toward older age group from
1989 to 1997.
Figure 1 shows the trends of weight and height over time
by gender and region. Average weight and height all
increased significantly over time, and the increase was simi-
lar for boys and girls. The mean weight and height in urban
area were higher than in the rural area. The increase in
weight was more evident in urban areas, whereas the
increase in height was more evident in rural areas.
Trends in BMI and prevalence of overweight and obesity
over time by region are shown in Figure 2. In urban areas,

mean BMI increased from 15.8 kg=m2 in 1989 to 17.5 kg=m2
in 1997, the prevalence of overweight increased from 14.6 to
28.9%, and the prevalence of obesity increased from 1.5 to
12.6%. In rural areas, mean BMI values did not change
substantially over time. The prevalence of obesity increased
first from 5.2% in 1989 to 7.8% in 1993, then decreased to
4.8% in 1997.
Longitudinal analyses for the follow-up data
We modeled the trends in BMI over time, adjusting for age,
height, gender, parental overweight status and region (Table
2). Overall, BMI increased significantly over time after
adjusting for age and height. Boys were heavier than girls.
Children whose parents were overweight were heavier than
those whose parents were not overweight. In addition, from
models 2 ­ 4 in Table 2, significant interactions were found
between time trend and region, parental overweight status,
and child's overweight status at baseline. The mean BMI in
urban areas increased more quickly than in rural areas (0.20
vs 0.11 kg=m2=y); the BMI of children with an overweight
parent increased more quickly than those without an over-
weight parent (0.16 vs 0.10 kg=m2=y); and the BMI among
children who were not overweight at baseline increased
more quickly than children who were overweight at baseline
(0.16 vs 7 0.08 kg=m2=y).
Table 3 shows the results from a multivariate model using
overweight or obesity as the dependent variables. The pre-
valence of obesity decreased with increasing age, and a
strong positive association was seen between parental over-
weight and their children's obesity. A significant interaction
was observed between time and region. A increasing time
trend of obesity was observed in China urban areas (it
increased about 27% per year), but no increase was observed
in rural areas. Results were similar for overweight; it
increased about 12% per year in urban areas.
Predicting overweight status in 1997
In a multivariate logistic model, children's overweight status
in early childhood (2 ­ 6 y), parental overweight, high
income and urban area independently predicted overweight
at age 10 ­ 14 y (Table 4). The risk of overweight at age 10 ­ 14
was 2.2 times higher among children who were overweight

at baseline than those children who were not overweight at
the same age. The risk of overweight was about four times
greater among children with an overweight parent than
those whose parents were not overweight. The risk of over-
weight in median or high household income level was about
twice as high compared with low income level, although this
estimate was not statistically significant.
Discussion
Rapid increase in childhood obesity has been observed in
developed countries during the past decade. In the US, the
prevalence of overweight (defined by 85th percentile of
weight-for-height) among 5 to 24-y-olds from a biracial
community of Louisiana (total n ¼ 11 564) increased
approximately two-fold between 1973 and 1994.27 Similar
increasing trends have been observed in many developing
countries.28 ­ 33 The prevalence of obesity among school
children aged 6 ­ 12 y in Thailand (diagnosed by weight-for-
height > 120% of the Bangkok reference), rose from 12.2% in
1991 to 15.6% in 1993.29 Ding32 also reported that the
prevalence of obesity among children of 0 ­ 7 y in China
increased from 0.91% in 1986 to 2.0% in 1996. These
estimates were much lower than our findings, partly because
different obesity standards and populations were used.
Our study found a dramatic increase in the prevalence of
overweight and obesity among preschool children in urban
areas of China from 1989 to 1997, the prevalence of over-
weight increased from 14.6 to 28.6%, and the prevalence of
obesity increased from 1.5 to 12.6%. In rural areas, both
height and weight have increased over time. Because the
increase in height was more rapid, the prevalence of over-
weight and obesity has not increased appreciably in rural
areas. After controlling for potential confounders, there was
a significant increasing trend in BMI in urban areas
(0.2 kg=m2=y) and the prevalence of obesity increased 27%
per year in urban areas.
Defining obesity or overweight for children and adoles-
cents is difficult due to different rates of maturation and
growth, and there is no generally accepted definition of
obesity or overweight for children and adolescents.34 A
variety of criteria for overweight and obesity have been
used to evaluate prevalence and trends among children
and adolescents,35 ­ 38 which has made comparisons between
studies difficult. Thus it is crucial to have an international
standard to define childhood obesity. The IOTF standard23
was proposed recently, which used percentile curves which
were drawn at age 18 y passed through the widely used cut-
off points of 25 and 30 kg=m2 for adult overweight and
obesity. We used this standard because it can be used for
both children and adolescents, and it can facilitate interna-
tional comparisons.34 However, some have argued39 that the
standard may not be appropriate for Asian and Pacific chil-
dren who grow and mature very differently from some of the
reference populations (Brazil, Great Britain, Hong Kong, The
Netherlands, Singapore, and the United States). Thus, the
rates of overweight and obesity shown here should be viewed
as conservative estimates. The actual prevalence could have
been considerably higher if a leaner reference population has
been used. However, this limitation should not have affected
the assessment of time trends.

Numerous studies have shown that increased energy
intake and sedentary lifestyle are the two characteristics
most strongly associated with the increased prevalence of
obesity worldwide.40 In developed countries, especially in
the US, television viewing and snacking are considered
important factors of childhood obesity, because snacking
while viewing TV tends to result in a higher energy intake
and lower energy expenditure.41 A similar relationship
between the prevalence of obesity and television watching
was observed in Chinese children.42
Another possible explanation for the increased childhood
obesity is the rapid change in dietary pattern in China.43
Western fast foods have become very popular in large cities
of China. Fast foods are high in fat and energy and low in
fiber; frequent consumption of fast foods will probably
increase the intake of total energy.
The study has several limitations. First, substantial pro-
portions of the children were lost to follow-up. However, we
found no significant differences in prevalence of overweight
and obesity and other characteristics at baseline between
dropouts and those who remained in the study. Thus, the
dropout should not affect the cross-sectional analysis of
obesity prevalence at each survey for children aged 2 ­ 6 y
old. Second, the CHNS did not collect information on
physical activity. It is unclear whether activity levels have
increased or decreased over time. Despite these limitations,
the CHNS is a unique dataset and provides an unprecedented
opportunity to conduct both cross-sectional and longi-
tudinal analyses of childhood obesity in China.
In conclusion, we found a substantial increase in child-
hood obesity in China, especially in the urban areas. Our
study revealed the risk of overweight among children aged
10 ­ 14 y increased substantially if the children were over-
weight at 2 ­ 6 y. Thus, preventive efforts should start at an
early age.
