Abstract
Objective: This study examines the relationship between tea consumption and colon
cancer risk in the US population.
Design: Data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up study (NHEFS) were used
to examine the hypothesis. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine
the hypothesis of a protective effect of frequent tea consumption on colon cancer
occurrence.
Setting: Due to differences in the precision of the exposure data, we analysed two
cohort periods based on the NHEFS. Cohort I was based on the survey conducted at
the NHEFS baseline and Cohort II began at the first follow-up.
Subjects: After excluding non-incidence cases and cases lost to follow-ups, there were
2359 tea users and 6498 non-tea users at baseline and 7656 tea users and 4514 non-tea
users at the first follow-up.
Results: After adjusting for confounders, the relative risks of colon cancer are 0.57
(95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42, 0.78) and 0.59 (95% CI ¼ 0:35; 1.00) for subjects
who consumed #1.5 cups and .1.5 cups per day, respectively, compared with non-
tea users in Cohort II. Although more women consumed tea and the mean intake was
higher, the preventive effect of tea consumption on colon cancer was found
predominantly in men. The relative risks of colon cancer are 0.41 (95% CI ¼ 0:25;
0.66) for men who consumed #1.5 cups day21 and 0.30 (95% CI ¼ 0:09; 0.98) for
.1.5 cups day21 of tea consumption (P-value for trend ,0.01). No significant results
were found in Cohort I.
Conclusions: This study suggests an inverse association between colon cancer risk
and habitual tea consumption.

Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death
in the United States1 ­3. The American Cancer Society
estimates that about 93 800 new cases of colon cancer
will be diagnosed in the year 2000 and account for
about 8% of all newly diagnosed cancers3. The
identification of risk factors for colon cancer and
subsequent intervention against the risk factors,
especially in the at-risk population, hold greater promise
for achieving the goal of decreasing mortality rates from
this disease than does treatment.
Although a genetic component is well established, 85%
of colon cancer cases are still considered `sporadic'. In
addition, indirect evidence, based largely on the
differences in cancer rates across countries4 and changes
in rates over time and among migrants5 ­7, implies that
environmental factors ­ diet in particular ­ are also
important. A search for the dietary risk factors for colon
cancer is warranted in order to reduce colon cancer
incidence and the healthcare costs of this disease.
Tea has a history of human use of over 4000 years and is
the second most commonly consumed beverage in the
world. There are emerging data on the anti-carcinogenic
benefits of tea consumption. In vitro experiments and in
animal models have shown tea to be an effective agent
against chemically induced tumorigenesis, affecting
induction, tumour size and metastases8­ 11. Epidemiologi-
cal study results, however, have been inconsistent in
showing the beneficial effect of tea consumption on
cancer prevention.
The First National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study
(NHEFS) is a prospective cohort study with a probability
sample of men and women from the non-institutionalised
US population and includes a wide range in age, socio-
economic status and ethnicity. This study uses the NHEFS
data to examine whether there is an inverse association
between habitual tea consumption and colon cancer risk
over an approximately 20-year follow-up period.

Methods
Study population
Detailed descriptions of NHANES I and NHEFS have been
published previously12 ­ 18. In brief, NHANES I was
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
from 1971 to 1975. Baseline data on sociodemographic
characteristics, medical history, diet, and biochemical and
anthropometric measures were collected from a US
national probability sample of non-institutionalised
persons aged 25 to 74 years. Population subgroups
thought to be at `nutritional risk' were over-sampled. Four
waves of follow-up for the 14 407 subjects who underwent
the medical examination were conducted in the NHEFS
during 1982­84, 1986, 1987 and 1992. Those who had
died were followed up by proxy interview. Of the 14 407
participants eligible for follow-up, 13 291 (92.2%) were
successfully traced through 1992. Death certificates were
coded according to the ninth revision of the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-9).
Colon cancer cases
Cancer morbidity was self-reported in four follow-up
interviews; cancer mortality was ascertained through
proxy interview and information from the National
Death Index. In rare situations where the year of first
cancer diagnosis was not available, the midpoint between
two interviews was used as the year of cancer incidence.
The cause of death was validated by referring to the
primary cause of death listed on the death certificate by the
NCHS. International Classification of Diseases ICD-9-CM
code 153 was used to identify colon cancer morbidity as
the first cancer incidence other than skin cancer. Cancer
cases that reported having had other cancers previously
were excluded from the analysis. If subjects reported
multiple cancers in the same year and colon cancer was
among the cancers, colon cancer was selected as the
primary cancer incidence. Overall, colon cancer cases
were determined primarily from the morbidity infor-
mation. If subjects died of colon cancer but never reported
colon cancer morbidity, the subjects were assigned as
colon cancer cases and the time of death was identified as
the cancer incidence. The follow-up time of cases was
calculated by subtracting the month and year of the
baseline interview from the mid-year of the `incidence' of
colon cancer. Similarly, for lost subjects, the follow-up
time was estimated as the total number of months between
baseline interview and the time of censoring. The
censoring time was either the time of dropout (loss to
follow-up or cancer of other sites) or the end of the study
in July 1993.
Tea consumption
Tea consumption status was based on a 24-hour dietary
recall data and one question on consumption of tea
and coffee in the baseline survey (1972­74) and the
food-frequency questionnaire solicited in the 1982­84
follow-up survey. The baseline questionnaire did not
distinguish between tea and coffee consumption. There-
fore, if subjects reported tea drinking in the 24-hour
dietary recall regardless of the response to the single
question in the questionnaire, the amount of tea
consumption is used as daily tea intake. However, if
subjects responded `yes' to the question but reported no
coffee consumption in the 24-hour recall, the average
amount of tea consumed by tea users in the NHEFS is used
to define the amount of tea consumption. The food-
frequency questionnaire conducted in 1982­84 contained
much more detail about tea drinking practices and
frequency of consumption. We are able to directly
calculate the amount of daily tea consumption.
Analytic cohorts
Two distinct analytic cohorts were defined. Cohort I was
based upon the initial interview with its baseline
(1971­75). Cohort II included all persons free of cancer
until the first follow-up (1982­84) of the NHEFS. Cohort I
was followed for approximately 20 years ðn ¼ 14 407Þ;
Cohort II was followed for approximately 10 years
ðn ¼ 10 220Þ:
Dietary intakes
Dietary records were obtained from a single 24-hour recall
interview at the baseline survey for 10 220 members of the
NHEFS cohort. Intakes of 13 nutrients for the foods
consumed in the NHANES I baseline survey were
calculated by the NCHS. Intakes of total calories, calcium,
total fat and dietary fibres were included as covariates to
assess possible confounding effects of these on the
tea­colon cancer relationship.
Other covariates
Sociodemographic variables obtained from the baseline
survey (age, education, race, gender and poverty index)
were included in the examination as possible confounders
or effect modifiers. Questions on alcohol consumption
were asked at the baselines of both cohorts. Non-drinkers
were defined as those who reported no alcohol
consumption in the past year. The average number of
drinks consumed per week was derived by multiplying the
frequency of drinking by the average amount usually
consumed. The calculation of body mass index (BMI,
kg m22) was based on self-reported weight and height at
baseline. In addition, subjects were asked at the 1982­84
and 1992 interviews whether any close family members
(parents/siblings/children) had cancer and, if so, the types
of cancer. The information from both waves of interviews
was then combined to create the variable for familial colon
cancer history. Aspirin use over the 30 days prior to the
baseline interview was entered as a dichotomous (yes/no)
variable; the use of vitamin or mineral supplements in the
past month was also assessed and coded as yes/no. Three

levels of physical activity were estimated based on the self-
reported amount of physical activity engaged in.
Exclusions
Among the eligible subjects, 172 subjects had either
metastasised colon cancer or previously diagnosed cancer
before the first follow-up of NHEFS in 1982­84. As a
result, 219 colon cancer cases and 9792 non-cases were
entered into the study analyses.
Statistical analyses
Cox proportional hazard models, with adjustment for
potential confounders (age, race, gender, education,
aspirin use, vitamin/mineral use, body mass index,
physical activity, dietary intakes of calories, fat, fibre and
calcium, and family history of colon cancer), were used to
estimate the relationship between tea consumption and
the relative risk of colon cancer. Vitamin and mineral use,
aspirin use, alcohol consumption and baseline smoking
status were missing for some subjects. Covariate inclusion
was based on whether inclusion of a covariate changed
the coefficient for the main variable by more than 10%.
Family history of colon cancer, vitamin and mineral use,
physical activity and smoking at baseline were thus not
included in the final models. Both continuous and
categorical tea consumption variables were used to
model colon cancer risk. Gender and race were assessed
for possible effect modification.
Results
The summary demographic characteristics of the
NHEFS Cohorts were stratified by tea consumption
status (Table 1). After the exclusion of subjects with
incomplete information, this study consisted of 3884
subjects reporting no tea drinking at both baseline
(1971­75) and first follow-up (1982­84), 6532 subjects
reporting tea consumption at either baseline or first
follow-up, and 1919 subjects reporting tea consump-
tion in both surveys. The mean age was significantly
higher in non-tea users than in tea users ðP , 0:01Þ:
Men were more likely to be non-tea users than women
in this study. A higher percentage (57.9%) of non-tea
users had less education (,12th grade) than users
(37.5% and 34.5% for short-term and long-term users,
respectively). Long-term tea users were more likely to
be white, had family history of colon cancer, and take
a vitamin/mineral supplement.
Tea consumption at baseline and the risk of colon
cancer adjusted for confounders are summarised for the
NHEFS Cohort I (Table 2). Although there is generally an
inverse relationship between colon cancer risk and
whether subjects consume tea or not, the relationship
did not achieve statistical significance when the data for
men and women were combined or analysed separately.
When the association between tea consumption and colon
cancer risk was examined based on the amount of tea
consumed each day, a non-significant inverse trend

ðP ¼ 0:15Þ was observed in men but not women in this
study.
The association between tea consumption and colon
cancer risk in the NHEFS Cohort II was also examined
(Table 3). When data from men and women were
combined, individuals reporting tea consumption showed
significantly reduced risk for colon cancer compared with
non-users (relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.43, 0.78). The association remained significant when
tea consumption was examined based on the number of
cups of tea consumed each day. In addition, a significant
inverse trend ðP , 0:01Þ was observed for the associ-
ation. When men in the NHEFS Cohort II were examined
alone, the risk reduction for tea consumption was even
greater. A strong dose­response relationship ðP , 0:001Þ
was observed, with approximately 59% and 70% reduced
colon cancer risk for those consuming 0­1.5 cups and
for those consuming more than 1.5 cups per day,
respectively, compared with men who did not drink tea.
Although women who consumed tea demonstrated a
reduced relative risk of colon cancer compared with
women who did not drink tea, the association did not
reach statistical significance (RR ¼ 0:69; 95% CI ¼ 0:46;
1.04).
Discussion
Findings from epidemiological studies of the relationship
between tea consumption and colon cancer risk have
been inconsistent. These studies have found tea to be
either preventive19, a risk factor20, or to have no
association with colon cancer21. The current study found
a significantly reduced risk for habitual tea consumers
when compared with non-users in the NHEFS Cohort II. In
the male population in the study, the inverse dose­
response relationship was significant. The risk reduction
measured in the NHEFS 1982­84 survey reached as high
as 70% for men who consumed more than 1.5 cups of tea
each day. The relationship for women in the NHEFS
Cohort II and for the entire NHEFS Cohort I did not reach
statistical significance.
The NHEFS has some powerful advantages as a cohort.
Since it reflects the underlying diversity of the US
population as a whole, it has greater power to detect an
effect than a more homogeneous cohort. In addition, the
results from this cohort have great external validity to the
US population. Concerns about recall bias are excluded in
a cohort design as dietary data are collected prior to the
disease diagnosis. The relatively large sample size and the

successful follow-up rate of approximately 90% provide
an excellent data source for the hypotheses in question.
However, there are some limitations to the use of the
NHEFS data. The questionnaire at baseline asked whether
subjects drank tea or coffee in one question. Thus it is
unclear whether subjects who had a positive answer to this
question were tea drinkers, coffee drinkers or drinkers of
both coffee and tea. Besides, no specific information was
obtained regarding either the frequency or the portion of
the beverage consumed. In order to avoid misclassification
bias, the information was cross-checked with the 24-hour
dietary recall data. If an individual reported drinking any
coffee but not tea on the particular day of recall, the
subject was then categorised as a non-user of tea. If an
individual was determined as a tea user in the question but
no specific amount of consumption was given in the recall
data, the average daily consumption amount among tea
users was assigned to that subject. These two approaches
to code tea consumption data at baseline aim to minimise
possible differential misclassification. Twenty-four hour
recall is a valuable tool for capturing frequent (daily) tea
consumption but is less reliable in appropriately
characterising infrequent consumers. Therefore, the
analyses of baseline tea consumption in this study may
not capture those who consumed both tea and coffee
infrequently in the baseline period, or even tea drinkers
who happened not to drink tea at the particular day of the
24-hour dietary recall assessment. As a result, the estimates
for the relationship between tea and colon cancer may be
biased towards the null and thus weaken the observed
associations.
On the other hand, tea consumption in the NHEFS
Cohort II was assessed using a semi-quantitative food-
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for average dietary intakes
over the past year. Tea consumption and coffee
consumption were queried in separate questions and the
frequency, as well as portion size, were assessed
separately. The FFQ provides a better quantitative estimate
for habitual tea consumption than the 24-hour dietary
recall used in the NHEFS Cohort I. The results of this study
not only reflect the ability of the FFQ to quantify the
habitual tea consumption, but also demonstrate a
consistent and stronger preventive effect of tea consump-
tion on colon cancer compared with findings from Cohort
I. This is a secondary data analysis study. It is impossible
for us to assess the validity of tea consumption data. There
is no way to compare the findings from Cohort I and
Cohort II to determine which one is more valid. It is,
however, clear that the method used to assess tea
consumption in Cohort II is a better instrument to capture
habitual dietary intake22 ­25. Besides, findings from both
cohorts show an inverse relationship between tea
consumption and colon cancer risk. In addition, categori-
cal analysis based on tea consumption pattern over the
two-survey period, as ordered in Table 1, suggests that
there are 86% ðP ¼ 0:04Þ and 42% ðP ¼ 0:15Þ increased
risk for men and women, respectively, when comparing
subjects who never drank tea with long-term tea drinkers
(data not shown). This finding indirectly supports that the
Cohort II results may be more representative of the effect
of tea consumption on colon cancer risk.
Data from laboratory studies suggest that specific types
of tea have different impacts on carcinogenesis26,27.
Unfortunately, neither cohort of the NHEFS assessed
various types of tea. Lacking information regarding the
types of tea used, the results of this study might be prone
to misclassification. Given that even the NHANES III
(1988­94) dietary assessment data show minimal green
tea consumption in the US population, it is reasonable to
assume that the majority of the population in the USA
consumed black tea at the time that the NHEFS surveys
were conducted in the early 1970s and again in the early
1980s. Therefore, the degree of misclassification for types
of tea consumed should be minimal. The results seen in
this study should be mostly from the effect of black tea.
It is not clear why the preventive effect of tea
consumption is stronger in men than women in this
study. One explanation may be that the women in this
study are significantly younger than are the men. Besides,
the risk of colon cancer is lower for women than for men
to start with28. The non-significant result observed in
women may simply be the result of the lower susceptibility
to colon cancer risk among this particular population. On
the other hand, this study found that the percentage of
alcohol users is higher in women than in men in both
cohorts. This finding is contradictory to the finding from
another US study29. It is possible that men in this study
may be more likely to underreport alcohol drinking than
women30. Since alcohol drinking has been linked to colon
cancer risk31 ­34, insufficient control for alcohol use may
bias the study results. The finding of a higher percentage
of women reporting drinking alcohol is consistent across
both baseline and first follow-up surveys. The finding of a
stronger effect of tea on colon cancer in Cohort II should
not be attributed as the result of residual confounding due
to insufficient controlling of the self-reported alcohol
consumption information.
This study excluded subjects who developed cancer
before the study for each of the cohorts. However, Cohort
II subjects may have modified their lifestyle and health
behaviour simply because they are enrolled in the study.
Given the lengthy latent period for colon carcinogenesis,
the information collected at the first follow-up survey used
as `baseline' data for Cohort II may have reflected the
modified behaviour, especially after close to 10 years in
the study since they entered the study in the early 1970s.
Fortunately, NHEFS did not actively contact study
participants between each survey, as did another
prospective cohort study35. Subjects did not receive
updated health information from the NCHS. Besides, tea
consumption was not considered beneficial during the
survey period in the 1970s and early `80s. Subjects were

not likely to modify their health behaviour towards tea
drinking by simply being in the follow-up study. The
direct effect from participation should be minimal.
However, residual confounding effects from other lifestyle
factors may exist.
In conclusion, this study found a significant inverse
association between habitual tea consumption and colon
cancer risk among men. The association is less strong in
women. Infrequent tea consumption based on a single
24-hour dietary recall with a longer follow-up period did
not show significant association. Although the study
results should be interpreted cautiously given the nature of
the study limitations, an apparent colon cancer prevention
effect was seen for men who consumed more than 1.5
cups of tea per day. Considering the increased popularity
of the consumption of both green and black tea, this study,
along with experimental data, suggests that the preventive
effect of tea on colon cancer merits further study.
