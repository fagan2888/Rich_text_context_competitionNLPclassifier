Background--The metabolic syndrome predicts future coronary artery disease and type II diabetes and often emerges in
childhood. Tobacco smoke potentially contributes to insulin resistance in this syndrome. This study evaluates the
association of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and active smoking with the prevalence of the metabolic
syndrome in US adolescents.
Methods and Results--Data from 2273 subjects 12 to 19 years of age were examined from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III, 1988 to 1994). Serum cotinine levels, presence of household smokers,
and self-report of smoking were used to determine ETS exposure and active smoking. The metabolic syndrome was
defined as having 3 criteria from the National Cholesterol Education Panel definition. Bivariate and multivariable
analyses were conducted. Among adolescents, 5.6% met the criteria for metabolic syndrome, and prevalence increased
with tobacco exposure: 1.2% for nonexposed, 5.4% for those exposed to ETS, and 8.7% for active smokers (P0.001).
In adolescents at risk for overweight and overweight adolescents (body mass index above the 85th percentile), a similar
relationship was observed: 5.6% for nonexposed, 19.6% for those exposed to ETS, and 23.6% for active smokers
(P0.01). In multivariable logistic regression analyses among all adolescents, ETS exposure was independently
associated with the metabolic syndrome (ETS exposure: odds ratio, 4.7, 95% CI, 1.7 to 12.9; active smoking: odds ratio,
6.1; 95% CI, 2.8 to 13.4).
Conclusions--Considering that tobacco and obesity are the 2 leading causes of preventable death in the United States,
these findings of a dose-response, cotinine-confirmed relationship between tobacco smoke and metabolic syndrome
among adolescents may have profound implications for the future health of the public. (Circulation. 2005;112:862-869.)

Obesity is poised to overtake tobacco as the No. 1 cause
of preventable death in the United States.1 According to
the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease
Control, obesity was responsible for 400 000 deaths, just shy
of tobacco's death toll of 435 000, in the year 2000.2
Exacerbated by a modern lifestyle of poor nutrition and
physical inactivity, the rising trend of obesity has affected
Americans of all ages. The percentage of children who are
overweight (body mass index [BMI] 95th percentile for age
and gender) has tripled in the last 2 decades to current
estimates of 15% among those 6 to 19 years of age.3 The
Surgeon General's Report states that the health problems
resulting from obesity threaten to reverse the major improve-
ments in health accomplished in the 20th century.1
The emergence of the obesity epidemic is especially
important to the development of the metabolic syndrome, a
clinical entity defined by the clustering of cardiovascular risk
factors that include central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypergly-
cemia, and hypertension. The metabolic syndrome is espe-
cially important because it often develops in childhood,4,5 has
a substantially higher prevalence in overweight children,6
increases directly with the degree of obesity,7 and presages
type II diabetes8,9 and adult cardiovascular disease,10,11 cur-
rently America's No. 1 cause of mortality.12 Recent estimates
of the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in US adoles-
cents (4%) compared with adults (23.7%) obfuscate its
growing prevalence among overweight adolescents. We re-
cently reported that in normal-weight adolescents 12 to 19
years of age (BMI 85th percentile) nationwide, the meta-
bolic syndrome is rare, with a prevalence of 0.1%.6 In
comparison, the metabolic syndrome was found to occur in
6.1% of those at risk for overweight (BMI 85th percentile

but 95th percentile) and in 28.7% of those overweight (BMI
95th percentile). Eighty percent of adolescents with the
metabolic syndrome are overweight, signifying the unique
vulnerability of a growing segment of the nation's youth to
the development of this syndrome and to subsequent prema-
ture cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes.
A growing body of evidence also indicates that tobacco
smoke is independently associated with insulin resistance and
that the insulin resistant condition may contribute to the
accelerated atherosclerosis that leads to excessive cardiovas-
cular disease in adult smokers.13 Tobacco smoke is clearly
associated with dyslipidemias (increased LDL and decreased
HDL),14,15 endothelial dysfunction, and a hypercoagulable
state,16 all of which are also components of the metabolic
syndrome. Additionally, a dose-response relationship exists
with cigarette smoking and the development of type II
diabetes in adults.17 These findings suggest that because both
tobacco smoke and the metabolic syndrome are individually
associated with insulin resistance, these 2 entities may be
linked through this common pathophysiology and that over-
weight children and youth may be especially susceptible to
the impact of tobacco smoke on cardiovascular health,
considering that tobacco smoke and obesity both predispose
to the constellation of cardiovascular risk factors seen in the
metabolic syndrome.
The present study sought to investigate the association
between both active smoking and environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS), also known as secondhand smoke, exposure,
and the metabolic syndrome among adolescents in the United
States. We hypothesized that tobacco smoke exposure is
associated in a dose-dependant manner with the metabolic
syndrome in adolescents.
Methods
Data from 3211 subjects 12 to 19 years of age from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988 to
1994) were examined. The response rate for this age range partici-
pating in the examination component of the survey was 83%.
NHANES III is a cross-sectional health survey that used a complex,
multistage design to achieve a nationally representative sample of the
noninstitutionalized civilian population in the United States. Partic-
ipants were evaluated with a home interview to determine family
medical history, current medical conditions, medication use, self-
report of the presence of any smokers in the household, and
socioeconomic and demographic information. Additionally, each
person was randomly assigned to undergo a morning, afternoon, or
evening examination at a mobile examination center consisting of
physical exams and laboratory testing using blood and urine samples.
Morning participants were asked to fast for 8 hours; afternoon and
evening participants were asked to fast for 6 hours.
Further details about the determination and analysis of serum
triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and glucose levels have been de-
scribed elsewhere.3 Blood pressure measurements for adolescents
17 years of age were averaged from 3 measurements taken at the
participant's home and 3 taken at the examination center. The first
and fifth Korotkoff sounds were used for the systolic and diastolic
values. For adolescents 12 to 16 years of age, only the 3 blood
pressure measurements at the examination center were taken, and the
average of those 3 measurements was used. Measurements for height
were taken with a stadiometer in subjects in an upright posture;
weight was measured with a self-zeroing scale. Waist circumference
measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 cm, with the patient at
minimal respiration.18 The point of measurement was between the
bottom of the ribcage and the top of the iliac crest. The sample
numbered 2273 after the following exclusion criteria were applied:
(1) had not fasted for 6 hours; (2) was currently pregnant; (3) was
taking medication classified as a blood glucose regulator such as
insulin, androgens or anabolic steroids, or adrenal corticosteroids; or
(4) had no serum cotinine level available. In the regression analysis,
we included 2006 subjects who had complete data for all covariates
in the final model.
Definitions
At Risk for Overweight and Overweight
Weight status was assessed with age- and gender-specific BMI.
Those with a BMI 85th percentile were classified as normal
weight; those with a BMI 85th but 95th percentile were
classified as at risk for overweight; those with a BMI 95th
percentile were considered overweight; and all those with a BMI
85th percentile were classified as at risk for overweight and
overweight.19
Metabolic Syndrome
Although no universally accepted definition for the metabolic
syndrome in adolescents has been formulated, previously developed
criteria6 have been used in the literature that are based on values
from national references for cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose
for children and adolescents.16,20Â­22 Adolescents who had a waist
circumference 90th percentile for age and gender from this sample
population were classified as having abdominal obesity. Systolic and
diastolic hypertension was defined by having blood pressure values
90th percentile for age, sex, and height22 or currently using
antihypertensive medication. Participants were classified with hyper-
triglyceridemia if they had 110 mg/dL, low HDL if they had values
40 mg/dL, and elevated fasting glucose if they had serum glucose
values 100 mg/dL.23 Those with the metabolic syndrome were
defined as individuals with 3 of these abnormalities (Table 1).
Active Smoking and ETS Exposure
Cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, was used as a biomarker for both
active smoking and exposure to ETS. In addition to cotinine,
NHANES III includes adolescent self-report of smoking status and
parent/guardian report of the presence of any smokers in the
household. Active smokers were defined as those with cotinine
levels 15 ng/mL24 or those who reported smoking in the past 5
days. Those with serum cotinine levels that were detectable but 15
ng/mL and who did not report smoking in the past 5 days were
defined as exposed to ETS.24 A cotinine level of 0.05 ng/mL was
below the detection limit. Those with undetectable serum cotinine
levels, no reported smoking in the home, and no self-reported
smoking were defined as nonexposed. We used parental report of
smoking in the home to verify that the mean cotinine levels of those
living in households reported to contain a smoker were in fact higher
than the levels among those reported as living in a household without
a smoker. Before separating the ETS exposure group into terciles for
a secondary dose-response analysis, we excluded those adolescents
whose parents did not report the presence of any smokers in the
household to yield a group more enriched for true ETS exposure.
Thus, for the analysis involving this enriched group in ETS by

terciles, ETS exposure is defined as detectable cotinine 15 ng/mL,
no self-report of smoking in past 5 days, and adult guardian report of
smoker in the home. The definitions for active smoking and
nonexposed are identical to those described above for the initial
analysis. All definitions for smoke exposure categories are illustrated
in Table 2.
Statistical Analyses
We used 2 tests for bivariate analyses to determine the statistical
significance of associations of independent variables investigated
with the metabolic syndrome and its components. Student's t tests
were used to compare the mean serum cotinine levels and the
geometric mean of cotinine levels of those who were reported to live
in households with smokers with those who were reported not to live
in households with smokers. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was
used to test for trends. Variables found to be statistically significant
in bivariate analyses at P0.10 or thought to be associated with the
metabolic syndrome were included in multivariable logistic regres-
sion analyses to determine independent associations with the meta-
bolic syndrome. Variables in the logistic regression models were
screened for colinearity by examining correlation coefficients in
bivariate analyses, and no colinearity was found. Two additional
analyses were performed: one on overweight teens and one on teens
from households with reported smokers in the home. All analyses
were conducted with SAS,25 and SUDAAN statistical software was
used to account for the complex sample design of the NHANES and
to apply sampling weights to produce national estimates by adjusting
for the oversampling of young children, older adults, Mexican
Americans, and blacks.26
Results
The overall rate of nonexposure to tobacco (cotinine 0.05
ng/mL, no self-report of active smoking, and no report of
household members smoking) was 11.8%, ETS exposure
(cotinine 0.05 to 15 ng/mL and no self-report of active
smoking) was 67.0%, and active smoking (cotinine 15
ng/mL or self-report of smoking in the past 5 days) was
21.2%. When self-reported data alone were used, 52.3% of
adolescents reported no exposure to tobacco (neither house-
hold exposure nor actively smoking), 42.5% of adolescents
reported any household exposure (with or without actively
smoking), and 19.1% of adolescents reported actively smok-
ing. Serum cotinine levels were higher among adolescents for
whom the presence of a smoker in the home was reported (1.7
versus 0.4 ng/mL, P0.001; and 1.1 versus 0.2 ng/mL when
geometric mean cotinine levels were compared, P0.001).
There were no adolescents with cotinine levels 0.05 ng/mL
who reported smoking in the last 5 days.
The metabolic syndrome was present in 5.6% of US
adolescents overall: 8.1% of boys and 2.9% of girls
(P0.001), 6.5% of whites, 3.1% of blacks, and 6.7% of
Mexican Americans (P0.003) (Table 3). Age, poverty
status, parental history of diabetes or heart attack, and
reported presence of a smoker in the home were not statisti-
cally associated with increased rates of occurrence. In con-
trast, the rate increased with increasing BMI and level of
tobacco smoke exposure: 1.2% of nonexposed teens, 5.4% of
those exposed to ETS, and 8.7% of actively smoking teens
(P0.001).
In multivariable logistic regression analyses conducted
among all those 12 to 19 years of age, the following
characteristics were independently associated with the meta-
bolic syndrome after adjustment for gender, age, race/ethnic-
ity, poverty status, region, and parental history of diabetes or
heart attack: male gender (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6
to 6.6), black race (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.6), ETS
exposure (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.7 to 12.9), and active smoking
(OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 2.8 to 13.4) (Table 4). To control for
possible confounding of BMI with components of the meta-
bolic syndrome, identical multivariable analyses were con-
ducted among youth with a BMI 85th percentile. Male
gender, black race, ETS exposure, and active smoking again
were independently associated with the risk of metabolic
syndrome, with ORs similar to those of the entire adolescent
sample (Table 4). To test for the interaction between race/
ethnicity and poverty status and the metabolic syndrome, an
interaction term was added to the model, and the multivari-
able analysis was repeated. Black race remained associated
(OR, 0.4), but there was no statistically significant association
between poverty or the interaction term and the metabolic
syndrome.
To assess the potential burden of smoke exposure on at risk
for overweight and overweight teens, analyses were per-
formed on teens with BMIs 85th percentile, thus examining
the impact of the 2 most prevalent cardiac risk factors in
adults. In bivariate analyses among adolescents with a BMI
85th percentile, the metabolic syndrome was present in
5.6% of those who were nonexposed, 19.6% of those exposed
to ETS, and 23.6% of active smokers (test for trend, P0.01)
(Table 5). Among those who were overweight (BMI 95th
percentile; n318), the respective rates were 23.8%, 32.3%,

and 40.4% (test for trend, P0.08). Similar trends were
found for the following components of the syndrome: high
triglycerides, low HDL, and high waist circumference (each
statistically significant at P0.001 or less). Elevated fasting
glucose occurred in 11.6% of nonexposed, 14.1% of ETS
exposed, and 9.6% of actively smoking youth (P0.19). In
contrast, rates of elevated blood pressure were lowest among
actively smoking youth (6.2%), intermediate among those
exposed to ETS (9.8%), and highest among those nonexposed
(17.6%) (P0.01). Limitations of sample size would not
allow statistical reliability for multivariable analyses on this
subset; thus, they were not performed.
To examine a purer subset of adolescents exposed to
passive tobacco smoke, analyses were performed on only
those teens with a reported smoker in the home because
subjects would be less likely to lie about positive household
smoking. To assess for the possibility of a dose-response
relationship between metabolic syndrome and level of to-
bacco smoke exposure, cotinine levels for ETS-exposed
adolescents were categorized by tercile among youth in
households with reported smokers present. Adolescents who
had cotinine values in the ETS range but whose parents did
not report smokers in the home were excluded to provide a
group with optimal true ETS exposure. A linear relationship
was found between intensity of tobacco smoke exposure and
rates of the metabolic syndrome (the Figure). This apparent
dose-response relationship persisted in multivariable analyses
(Table 6).
Discussion
This study demonstrates a dose-response, cotinine-confirmed
relationship between tobacco smoke and the metabolic syn-
drome among adolescents in the United States. Data come
from a large, nationally representative sample with objective
biochemical rather than exclusive self-report measures of
smoking status. The findings indicate that exposure to to-
bacco smoke, whether by active smoking or exposure to ETS,
is associated with at least a 4-fold increase in the risk of the
metabolic syndrome among adolescents who are overweight
and at risk for overweight. These findings may have profound
implications in light of the still-increasing rates of overweight
and persistently high rates of active smoking and exposure to
ETS among adolescents in the United States.
Both smoking and the metabolic syndrome have individu-
ally been recognized as independent risk factors for cardio-
vascular disease and type II diabetes for some time, and at
least 2 previous studies have reported increased rates of the
metabolic syndrome among adult smokers.27,28 Never before,
to the best of our knowledge, have these associations been
investigated using a biological marker of smoking and ETS in
adolescents. Furthermore, although previous work has ex-
plored ETS by cotinine studies in adults, only individual
cardiovascular risk factors15 or coronary artery disease
deaths29 were examined, not the cluster of the adverse
physiological changes of the metabolic syndrome, as demon-
strated here.
The mechanisms underlying the development of the met-
abolic derangements that occur in the metabolic syndrome are
not fully understood. The most widely accepted hypothesis
posits a complex interaction between insulin resistance and
obesity that is modified by social, environmental, racial/
ethnic, and genetic factors.30Â­32 Although it is not possible to
conclusively establish an etiological role for tobacco smoke

in the development of the metabolic syndrome in youth from
this one cross-sectional observational study, a plausible
biological basis exists for this association. The fact that
diverse and complex individual components of the metabolic
syndrome (eg, abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, and dys-
lipidemia) cluster together more often than would be ex-
pected by chance alone has long suggested that a common
biological pathway might explain the frequent emergence of
this constellation of risk factors.31 There is evidence in studies
of children to suggest that insulin resistance mediates the
deleterious effects of excess adiposity on blood pressure and
lipids in the metabolic syndrome and that insulin resistance
operates independently of the degree of obesity.33,34 Addi-
tionally, studies have shown that smoking is associated with
increased insulin resistance in adults and may be a primary
defect leading to endothelial dysfunction, abnormal lipid
metabolism, and accelerated cardiovascular disease.13,35,36 If
this formulation is correct, then smoking and ETS exposure
may be causally related to insulin resistance, which in turn
may cause, contribute to, and/or trigger the metabolic abnor-
malities in overweight individuals that result in the metabolic
syndrome. In the present study, there are lower rates of
hyperglycemia in the exposed and active smoking groups.
This finding is difficult to explain; however, fasting glucose
has been shown to be highly insensitive for detecting diabetes
compared with other methods of assessing insulin resistance
such as glucose tolerance testing, insulin, proinsulin, or c
peptide. Unfortunately, these other measures are not available

in NHANES III. Because it is well accepted that insulin
resistance is an underlying force driving the metabolic syn-
drome and its components, we can only state that we were
unable to find a statistical difference related to hyperglycemia
in the study population. Although hyperglycemia, the least
common of the metabolic syndrome components, does not
trend in the direction one might expect, one cannot discount
the possibility that tobacco exposure plays a role in insulin
resistance. An insulin resistanceÂ­centered model would also
have significant clinical implications. Reaven and Tsao36
have suggested that, given the difficulty of making behavior
changes to alter both weight and smoking habits, drug therapy
targeting insulin resistance might significantly enhance the
ability of practitioners to clinically treat the adverse health
effects of obesity and smoking.
The findings reported here of both ETS exposure and
active smoking being associated with decreased rates of
hypertension are consistent with a number of studies in adults
showing that active smoking is associated with decreased
blood pressure.37Â­40 The literature on passive exposure to
ETS and blood pressure is still more limited and unclear, and
we could find no prior published studies of either the
association of ETS exposure or active smoking with blood
pressure among adolescents.
These data also reveal pronounced differences in rates of
the metabolic syndrome by gender and race, consistent with
other studies.7,41,42 These differences may at least in part be a
consequence of a lack of a universally accepted definition of
the metabolic syndrome in adolescents or, perhaps more
importantly, of the differences across gender and race in the
normal values for the various components of this syndrome.
For example, there is evidence that white children have
significantly higher serum triglyceride levels than black

children43 and have a stronger correlation between weight and
triglyceride concentrations.44 Similarly, Weiss et al7 found
that use of race- and ethnicity-specific cutoff points for serum
lipid levels might account for the differences between both
the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and the effect of
obesity, among blacks versus whites and Hispanics.
Although NHANES III (1988 to 1994) data were used,
there is no biologically plausible reason to believe that such
an association would not exist today. More important limita-
tions include the cross-sectional nature of the data, limiting
causal inferences and the possibility that part or all of the
observed associations between tobacco smoke exposure and
increased rates of the metabolic syndrome are due to some
unmeasured confounder or confounders. One such con-
founder may be physical activity, which is difficult to assess
in this population using NHANES III because questions
about physical activity were asked differently to children
16 years of age compared with children 16 years of age
in this survey. Because, unlike in adults, the metabolic
syndrome is found almost exclusively in youth at risk for
overweight or overweight adolescents,6 analyses for the
association of tobacco exposure with the metabolic syndrome
were investigated among those adolescents who were at risk
for overweight or overweight. It is possible that even after
adjustment for weight, adolescent smokers and those pas-
sively exposed to ETS may differ in diets, which may account
for some of the associations found in the present study
between the metabolic syndrome and tobacco exposure.
Furthermore, it is difficult to tell whether those reporting
active smoking with cotinine levels 15 ng/mL and those
with cotinine levels 15 ng/mL were also exposed to ETS;
thus, we cannot estimate the exclusive contribution of ETS
exposure to the increased risk of the metabolic syndrome
among those classified as active smokers. We also do not
know every source of ETS exposure such as in public settings
where ETS exposure could be reduced by bans on smoking.
In an effort to correctly classify active smokers, a cotinine
level of 15 ng/mL was used as a marker for active smoking.
This level, previously used in the literature on ETS expo-
sure,24 is low enough to include infrequent smokers. Other
studies use levels as high as 25 ng/mL45; thus, a more
conservative measure was applied in the present study. In our
analysis of dose response, we were not able to eliminate
misclassification bias entirely. Adolescents who are actually
smoking but deny smoking by self-report may still exist in the
"ETS exposed" group. However, parents who do report
presence of smokers in the household are likely to be telling
the truth, yielding a group that is more enriched for true ETS
exposure, as opposed to transient exposure in public locations
or a misclassification of exposure based on the temporally
dependent cotinine measure itself.46 Therefore, by excluding
those adolescents whose parents do not report the presence of
other smokers in the home, we have probably reduced the
number of adolescent active smokers who are lying about
their use in our ETS exposed group. This differential report-
ing phenomenon probably is due to normative beliefs by the
adolescent about what constitutes acceptable/reportable be-
havior in the context of smoking and nonsmoking
households.47
In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate a
dose-responsive, cotinine-confirmed relationship between to-
bacco smoke and the metabolic syndrome and the first that
we are aware of to demonstrate any association between
tobacco smoke and the metabolic syndrome in adolescents.
Although there may be reason to celebrate decreasing rates of
active and passive exposure to tobacco smoke, 1 in 5
adolescents are still actively smoking, and an additional two
thirds of all adolescents are exposed to tobacco smoke as
measured by biological markers. Exposure to tobacco smoke,
whether by active or passive smoking, is associated with an
4-fold increase in the risk of the metabolic syndrome
among adolescents who are overweight and at risk for
overweight. Considering that tobacco and obesity are indi-
vidually the 2 leading causes of preventable death in the
United States, these findings may have profound implications
for the future health of the public.
