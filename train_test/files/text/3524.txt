Introduction
The ocean waves are a vast source of energy; harnessing
this energy in a judicious way can become the main source
of electrical energy supply for countries with long shore-
lines. Yoshio Masuda (1925­2009), a pioneer in wave
energy technology development, studied the wave energy
devices since 1940. Masuda developed navigation buoys
installed with air turbine, which is later known as oscillat-
ing water column (OWC) (Masuda, 1986). Later, a large
(80 m × 12 m) barge, named Kaimei (Miyazaki and
Masuda, 1975), was used to test the OWCs. During the
same time, Salter (1974) tested a simple mechanism of
vertical vane pivoted about a horizontal axis which can
generate power using the oscillatory motion of ocean
waves. Since then, researchers have developed several dif-
ferent types of wave energy converters and tested in the
laboratory or real sea condition. Wave energy converters
are categorized mainly based on location, size, and work-
ing principles (Drew et al., 2009; Falcão, 2010; Falnes,
2007; López et al., 2013; Sabzehgar and Moallem, 2009).
One of the main issues of OWC is that it is not suitable for
all coastal regions and requires very specific location char-
acteristics. In spite of this, the OWCs have been studied
most extensively and maximum numbers of prototypes are
deployed into the sea.
The OWC, a pneumatic type wave energy device, can be
used as a fixed or a floating type. The plants at Sakata port
in Japan (Takahashi et al., 1992) and Vizhinjam, India
(Ravindran et al., 1997) are examples of such plants. The
Optimal design of air turbines for
oscillating water column wave
energy systems: A review
Tapas Kumar Das1, Paresh Halder1 and Abdus Samad2
Abstract
Oscillating water column wave energy harvesting system uses pneumatic power to run a turbine and generate power.
Both reaction (mainly Wells turbine) and impulse type turbines are tested in oscillating water column system and the
performances are investigated. Reaction turbines are easy to install, and the operating range is narrow and possesses
higher peak efficiency. On the contrary, impulse turbines have the wider operating range and lower peak efficiency.
Some of the key parameters for Wells turbine are solidity, tip clearance, and the hub-to-tip ratio. Significant performance
improvement is possible by redesigning the turbines using optimization techniques. Till date, surrogate modeling and an
automated optimization library OPAL are commonly used in optimization of oscillating water column air turbines. In
this article, various types of oscillating water column turbines are reviewed, and optimization techniques applied to such
turbines are discussed. The Wells turbine with guide vane has the maximum efficiency, whereas the axial-impulse turbine
with pitch-controlled guide vane has the widest operating range. Turbines with optimized geometry have better overall
performance than other turbines.

energy conversion process in OWC plant (Figure 1) occurs
in three phases. Initially, the oscillation of sea surface is
converted to pressure energy in the air chamber and the air
turbine converts the pressure energy into mechanical shaft
power (this system is also known as power take off mecha-
nism). Finally, the generator connected to the turbine con-
verts the shaft power to usable electrical power.
Most of the OWC systems for wave energy conversion
used till date mainly relied on two basic types of air tur-
bines: the Wells turbine and the impulse turbine. Unlike
the conventional impulse turbine, the impulse air turbine
for wave energy conversion is used with two rows of guide
vanes on both sides of the rotor to make the turbine rotate
in one direction regardless of incident airflow directions.
However, the presence of guide vane on the downstream
side of rotor introduces losses, which affect the turbine
performance considerably (Thakker and Dhanasekaran,
2005). Figure 2 shows various turbines used in OWCs,
which are discussed in the next section.
Some authors reviewed the articles on OWC and air
turbines. Setoguchi et al. (2001a) presented the review of
impulse turbines used for wave energy conversion.
Setoguchi and Takao (2006) and Takao and Setoguchi
(2012) compared different turbines including Wells and
impulse turbines. Falcao and Henriques (2016) extensively
reviewed air turbines including thermodynamics of air
chamber and control algorithms applied to OWC turbines.
However, these reviews did not discuss optimization tech-
niques applied to OWC turbines.
Optimization works in the area of air turbines are new,
and very few authors have applied optimization techniques
to improve the turbine performance through systematic
design optimization. This article discusses different tur-
bine options along with the performance improvement
achieved through optimization.
Turbine classification
Turbines are devices in which the rotor receives energy
from the flowing fluid and convert this energy into
mechanical energy. This mechanical energy is converted
into electrical power using a generator. Based on the type
of fluid, turbines are classified as steam, hydro, or air tur-
bines. The power generated by the turbine is derived from
equation (1). It is noticed that power developed is a func-
tion of pressure head and volume flow rate across the
turbine
P gQH
= (1)
Based on the rationale of energy transfer inside the tur-
bine, two main types of turbines exist: impulse turbines
and reaction turbines. In the case of impulse turbines, the
total pressure energy of the fluid is converted to kinetic
energy before hitting the rotor blades, whereas in the case
of reaction turbines, the pressure and kinetic energy both
change as the water flow through the rotor blades.
The Euler turbo-machinery equation relates the torque
of the turbine rotor T with the change in moment of
momentum of the fluid across turbine rotor (Vavra, 1960)

where S refers to the surface of revolution (subscript 1

Equation (4) shows that a positive torque is obtained
only when the tangential component of flow velocity at the
inlet is greater than the outlet, that is, V V

> . This is
achieved by the flow deflection inside the rotor. In conven-
tional turbines, the flow deflection occurs by a row of
fixed blades upstream of the rotor. However, in the case of
air turbines for OWCs, as the turbines need to be unidirec-
tional for a bidirectional flow, the guide vanes are placed
on either side of the rotor. Different combinations of guide
vanes in both reaction and impulse turbine with their per-
formance variation are discussed in the following section.
Wells turbine
Wells turbine is an axial flow reaction turbine specifically
used for wave energy extraction with the help of oscillat-
ing airflow. The turbine is made up of symmetric airfoil
type blades placed around a central hub (Figure 3) and
rotates in one direction irrespective of the direction of the
airflow. It has a rotational speed limited by the blade tip
velocity approaching toward the speed of sound. The tur-
bine is coupled with the electrical generator and operates
with or without guide vanes (Raghunathan et al., 1982).
The Wells turbine works on the general aerodynamics
theory of airfoil (Gato and Falcao, 1988; Raghunathan
et al., 1994; Raghunathan and Tan, 1983). Blades are set at
90° stagger angle. The absolute velocity of air hits the
blade axially and the tangential velocity of the blade acts
in a direction parallel to the plane of rotation. The relative
velocity W acting at an angle  (angle of attack) to the
blade causes a lift force L perpendicular to the direction of
W and a drag force D in the direction of W (Figure 4). This
lift and drag force can be resolved in tangential and axial
direction

For any airflow direction, the direction of tangential
force is always same. Therefore, the direction of the rota-
tion of turbine always remains the same. For any real fluids,
the lift and drag force on the airfoil increase up to a certain
value of the angle of attack () beyond which the flow sep-
arates around the airfoil. The angle at which flow separates
from the airfoil is known as the stall angle. Beyond the stall
angle, the lift force decreases and drag force increases sig-
nificantly. As a result, tangential force on the rotor
decreases, leading to the decrease in efficiency. Thus, the
angle of stall bounds the operating range of Wells turbine
(Raghunathan, 1995a).
Another main disadvantage of wells turbine is poor
starting characteristics and it is difficult to reach its opera-
tional speed (Inoue et al., 1986). This phenomenon of tur-
bine failing to reach its operational speed is known as

crawling (Raghunathan and Tan, 1982). Changing the hub-
to-tip ratio and the solidity improves the starting character-
istics of the turbine.
Parameters of Wells turbine
Some of the main geometric parameters that affect the per-
formance of wells turbine are solidity, hub-to-tip ratio,
aspect ratio, and tip clearance. Table 1 gives the analytical
description of the parameters. The parameters are interre-
lated. Based on the analytical solution, Raghunathan
(1995a) has given recommended values for these parame-
ters, which are listed in Table 1. To achieve maximum effi-
ciency and wide operating range, optimum values of these
parameters are required. This is discussed in section
"Optimization of air turbines."
Solidity is a way to calculate the blockage of airflow
within the Wells turbine and measures the mutual interac-
tion between the blades (Cruz, 2008; Raghunathan and
Tan, 1983). With increasing solidity, blades become too
close to each other. As a result, blades interact with the
boundary layer near hub leading to boundary layer separa-
tion on the surface of the hub as well as on the blade sur-
face near the hub (Gato et al., 1996; Watterson and
Raghunathan, 1998). This creates end wall losses in the
hub region. The effect of the hub-to-tip ratio is well stud-
ied (Raghunathan, 1995a), and the results indicate that
efficiency decreases with the increasing hub-to-tip ratio.
Effects of guide vane angle and tip clearance
(Dhanasekaran and Govardhan, 2005; Setoguchi et al.,
2003; Taha et al., 2011) are important parameters for the
performance of Wells turbine. Halder and Samad (2014)
carried out numerical analysis to study the effect of guide
vane angle on the performance of Wells turbine. For a par-
ticular symmetrical blade profile (NACA 0021) under
steady-state condition, guide vane angle of 11.8° gives
maximum efficiency. The efficiency is maximum for a tip
clearance of 1% (Halder and Samad, 2015a). In addition, a
circumferential groove (Halder et al., 2015b) with a groove
depth of 3% chord length produces the highest power and
widest operating range. Also for a particular operating
point, 26% improvement in efficiency is achieved using
this method (Halder et al., 2015b).
Guide vanes, self-pitch control blades, biplane turbines,
blade sweep, and duct geometry improve the performance
and starting characteristics of the turbine (Gato and Falcao,
1990; Halder et al., 2015a; Kim et al., 2002; Setoguchi
et al., 1998, 2001b; Shaaban and Abdel Hafiz, 2012; Takao
et al., 2000). Two stages of blades (Figure 5), both with
symmetric and asymmetric blade profile, were studied
(Gato and Curran, 1996). In a contra-rotating turbine, both
the rows of blade rotate in different directions (Figure 6).
LIMPET used two contra-rotating turbines each connected
to a 250 kW induction generator producing 500 kW maxi-
mum power output (Boake et al., 2002). One of the recent
developments in Wells turbine is to use three-dimensional
(3D) blade where the blade thickness varies in the radial
direction (Figure 7). Takao et al. (2015) used NACA0015
and NACA0025 at hub and tip, respectively, to create a
new 3D blade geometry. Halder and Samad (2015b) stud-
ied a blade profile created by combining NACA0015 and
NACA0024 at the hub and tip section, respectively. Results
indicated that the 3D blade has better performance in terms
of peak efficiency. All the modifications discussed here are
summarized in Table 2 for better understanding.
Impulse turbine
The main difference between a reaction turbine and an
impulse turbine is the way energy transfer occurs in the
rotor. Impulse turbines are classified based on the direction
of airflow through it: axial and radial. An impulse turbine
can be made bidirectional flow turbine using guide vanes
on both sides of the rotor. Airflow deflected by the guide

vanes hits the rotor blade and gives "impulse" to the tur-
bine. Because of the symmetrical nature of the guide vanes
and rotor blade, the turbine always rotates in the same
direction irrespective of the direction of airflow (Figure 8).
This type of turbine is also known as a self-rectifying tur-
bine. Furthermore, guide vanes can be classified as fixed,
self-pitch-controlled, and link mechanism type.
Although Wells turbine was the first choice to be used
in OWCs because of its self-rectifying characteristics, it
has many inherent disadvantages (Setoguchi et al., 2001a).
Axial turbines are very popular for its simplicity and ease
of operation in both unidirectional and bidirectional flows.
However, the axial turbines produce high axial thrust
which causes fatigue failure of bearings. Radial turbines
produce less axial thrust compared to the axial turbine. In
addition, the torque obtained by the radial turbine is high
due to the radial configuration. In spite of high damping
produced by the radial turbine, it is favorable because of its
toughness and low maintenance cost (Setoguchi et al.,
2000, 2002).
Axial impulse turbines
Turbine with self-pitch-controlled guide vane. The most pop-
ular alternative of the Wells turbine is the axial flow
impulse turbine. The geometry of the rotor blades of axial
flow impulse air turbine is just a modified version of con-
ventional steam turbine of impulse type. In the case of
self-pitching guide vane, two sets of guide vane on either
side of the rotor are pivoted and change direction accord-
ing to the direction of flow with the help of aerodynamic
moment. Guide vanes are also capable of changing orien-
tation in the right direction for efficient operation (Figure
9). The upstream guide vanes act as a nozzle and down-
stream guide vanes act as a diffuser (Setoguchi et al.,
2001a). Inoue et al. (1996, 2000) compared the analytical
and experimental result of an impulse turbine with self-
pitch-controlled guide vane. This is done for both steady
flow and oscillating flow conditions. As part of the Indian
wave energy program, an impulse turbine with self-pitch-
controlled guide vane is tested in the OWC-based wave
energy plant at Vizhinjam (Santhakumar et al., 1998).
Later, Setoguchi et al. (2004) carried out numerical anal-
ysis of this type of turbine to understand the performance
with respect to various parameters such as Reynolds
number and hub-to-tip ratio. From the idea of self-pitch-
controlled guide vanes, Liu et al. (2016) developed and
studied an impulse turbine with pitch-controlled blade.
For the particular turbine studied, results show that the
rotor blade pitch angle of 5° gives the best efficiency in a
wave cycle. The turbine shows better performance than

zero pitch angle blades. Similar to the self-pitch-con-
trolled guide vanes in impulse turbine, Wells turbine can
be used with self-pitch-controlled blades, where the sym-
metrical airfoil blades change the stagger angles by them-
selves to obtain higher torque (Figure 10; Setoguchi
et al., 1997).
Turbine with fixed guide vane.Although the turbine with
self-pitch-controlled guide vane operates with higher effi-
ciency over a wide range of flow rates, it has certain inher-
ent disadvantages because of the variable geometry design.
It requires a powerful configuration to withstand the self-
pitching mechanism for a substantial number of oscillation
cycles per day. In addition, the turbine consists of a large
number of moving parts, which leads to higher operating
and maintenance cost. Fixed guide vane can mitigate all
these problems with the cost of overall performance of the
turbine. Kim et al. (2000) carried out two-dimensional
numerical analysis based on full Reynolds-averaged
Navier­Stokes equation to investigate the internal flow
behavior of an impulse turbine with fixed guide vanes.
Results from other numerical analyses indicate that maxi-
mum efficiency occurs for a guide vane angle of 30°
(Maeda et al., 1999, 2001). The two-dimensional analysis
shows that significant total pressure drop occurs in the
downstream guide vanes, which leads to the lower perfor-
mance of the turbine. Thakker and Dhanasekaran (2005)
carried out a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis
on 3D guide vanes using the well-known vortex theory.
Experimental results indicate that the efficiency can be
improved by an average of 4.5% points by incorporating
3D guide vanes (Thakker et al., 2005). Numerical analysis
of flow through impulse turbine (Badhurshah et al., 2014)
shows that the flow separation occurs in the tip region near
trailing edge of the blade. However, with the increase in
rotational speed, the separation points shifts toward the
hub. A study on rotor solidity ratio recommends solidity of
0.63 to be used for best performance (Cui and Liu, 2014).
The comparison of the starting characteristics with Wells
turbine shows that both the types of impulse turbines
accelerate faster than the Wells turbine (Figure 11).
Radial impulse turbines
Self-rectifying radial-flow impulse turbines are studied to
investigate the suitability to use as air turbine for wave

Figure 11. Comparison of starting characteristics (Setoguchi et al., 2001a): (a) impulse turbine with self-pitching guide vane and

energy plants. Radial turbine with active pitch-controlled
guide vanes (Figure 12) has been studied thoroughly by
model test under steady sinusoidal flow. The steady sinu-
soidal flow is expressed as
U U U f
= + ( )
0
2
max
sin   (6)
where U is the inlet air velocity, f is the frequency of air-
flow, and  is the time step.
The characteristic of internal flow behavior is clarified
with the help of such tests. In addition, results show that
the performance of this turbine is much superior compared
to the conventional fixed guide vanes radial turbine (Takao
et al., 2005). Experimental tests were carried out on a bi-
radial impulse turbine under unidirectional steady flow
condition (Gato et al., 2012). As wave energy turbines are
installed inside a cylindrical configuration, the flow behav-
ior near the tip of the blade and guide vanes is different
from conventional turbines. Results show that the turbine
maximum efficiency reduces by up to 8% if the tip clear-
ance changes from 0% to 4% of the blade span (Pereiras
et al., 2011).
A new concept of twin impulse turbine was proposed
and model tested by Jayashankar et al. (2009) and Mala
et al. (2011). The experiment results show considerable
improvement in operating range. In addition, the wave to
wire efficiency crosses 50% with this specification.
Thakker et al. (2009) provided a chart for selection of
impulse turbine for wave energy extraction. The chart is
based on experimental data. For example, it can be seen
that for a rated power of 400 kW, the recommended rotor
diameter from the chart would be 1.6 m.
Wells turbine versus impulse turbine
One of the main disadvantages of impulse turbine is the
aerodynamic loss. This happens due to the large inci-
dence angle of airflow near the downstream row of guide
vanes (Karthikeyan et al., 2013); this is inevitable as it is
required for the symmetry of the guide vanes. A compari-
son of both the turbines indicates that the impulse turbine
has a wider operating range than the Wells turbine.
However, it comes at a cost of peak efficiency; the peak
efficiency of impulse turbine hardly exceeds 50% (Figure
13). For Wells turbine, the peak efficiency drops sharply
when the stall occurs at a higher flow rate. To reduce the
losses, variable geometry of guide vanes is proposed,
which is discussed in the previous section. A comparison
of efficiency with different non-dimensional flow coef-
ficient for the two types of turbines is shown in Figure
13. The two-dimensional flow analysis by Falcão and
Gato (2012) indicates that the change in Reynolds num-
ber has more impact on Wells turbine efficiency com-
pared to the impulse turbine efficiency.
Presently, there are a number of wave energy plants
operating on the OWC technology. A list of the types of
turbines being used and respective countries is mentioned
in Table 3. The list is not exhaustive, as there are few other
Figure 12. Radial turbine with pitch control guide vane (Takao et al., 2005).
44 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(1)
wave energy plants, which are in developing stage. It can
be seen that most of the prototypes and actual plants have
used Wells turbine for operation.
Optimization of air turbines
Optimization is a mathematical procedure aimed at find-
ing the best solution among the whole set by efficient
quantitative and qualitative methods. This section pre-
sents literature that tries to understand the performance
and behavior of various types of turbines with optimized
configurations. Optimization of the full system using
modern computational methods can bring significant
improvement in performance.
Optimization techniques are commonly used in turboma-
chines and aerospace systems to improve performance.
Application of optimization is seen in wind turbines for per-
formance improvement. However, literature related to opti-
mization of wave energy system is limited. Unlike trial and
error method, optimization here refers to numerical optimi-
zation using different algorithms. In the last decade, few
authors have come up with the optimized geometry of OWC
air turbines that shows better performance compared to con-
ventional turbines. This section gives a detailed review of
optimization methods used in OWC air turbines.
Optimization approaches are classified into traditional
(direct or gradient based) and heuristic methods. Heuristic
methods are favored in engineering optimization problems
due to its capability of finding the global optima in less
computational time. Authors worked on optimization of
air turbines using two main types of optimization tech-
niques: surrogate modeling and an automated optimization
algorithm, OPtimization ALgorithm (OPAL). Surrogate
model is an approximate model developed from hi-fidelity
computational models such as CFD. On the other hand,
OPAL is an optimization library that couples the computer-
aided design (CAD) model with the CFD code. Parameters
of wave energy turbines are interrelated. A multi-variable
multi-objective optimization (MOO) is required to arrive
at an optimized geometry for best performance.
Badhurshah and Samad (2015) carried out multiple
surrogate­assisted genetic algorithm­based MOO on an
impulse turbine to enhance the performance. The design
variables were number of rotor blade and guide vanes and
the objectives were the minimization of pressure drop and
the maximization of shaft power of the turbine. Response
surface approximation, neural network, kriging, and a
weighted-average surrogate (WAS) were used to generate

turbine and impulse turbine for different flow coefficients,

population for the MOO procedure and pareto optimal
fronts (PoF) of the objectives were produced. The effi-
ciency, which is a function of the both the objectives, is
increased by ~11% through this investigation (Figure 14).
Another study by the same author (Badhurshah and Samad,
2014) on the optimization of an impulse turbine shows that
relative efficiency can be improved by approximately 13%
over the full range of the flow coefficient (Figure 15).
Mohamed (2011) developed an automated optimization
algorithm, where a system can be optimized using a genetic
algorithm and performance evaluation by CFD technique.
The optimization of the airfoil shape (Figure 16) leads to a
relative gain of 11.3% in power output and 1% increase in
overall efficiency throughout the full operating range
(Mohamed et al., 2011). The same algorithm applied to
non-symmetric airfoil blades and self-pitch control blades
(Mohamed and Shaaban, 2014) shows significant improve-
ment in performance of the turbine.
Gomes et al. (2012) developed a two-step optimiza-
tion method for two-dimensional blade section of an
axial flow impulse turbine. A 3D geometry is obtained by
stacking two-dimensional optimized sections in spanwise
direction. A CFD analysis of initial design and the opti-
mized design shows almost 5% improvement in effi-
ciency. Halder and Samad (2016) determined optimal
turbine speed for Wells turbine using surrogate-based
optimization technique. A multiple surrogate­based
approach is used to determine optimal turbine speed for
different flow velocities. The analysis shows that a tur-
bine with 3% groove depth gives better performance than
a turbine with 1% tip clearance. Another study by Halder
et al. (2017) used the surrogate modeling technique to
optimize the blade sweep angle. The optimized turbine
blade has backward sweep at mid-section and forward
sweep at tip section. For the optimized geometry, torque
coefficient increased by 28.28% and the operating range
increases by 18.18%. It is clearly visible that optimization
techniques have been used successfully to improve the
performance of air turbines. A complete 3D optimization
may be complicated and numerically expensive; however,
it can give more accurate result than the previous ones.
All the design modifications done using optimization are
summarized in Table 4.
Conclusion
A comprehensive review of OWC air turbines (Wells and
impulse turbines) is reported in this article. Previous
review articles on OWC air turbines discuss different
design modifications and comparison with various tur-
bines. Unlike previous review papers, this article concen-
trates on the optimization of air turbines used in OWCs
along with a discussion on parameters of the air turbine.
It is expected that this article will help researchers in
OWC optimization to acquaint with the present state of
the art. Some of the main findings of this article are sum-
marized here:
·
· Among the various parameters affecting the perfor-
mance of Wells turbine, blade solidity and tip clear-
ance are the most important. Small tip clearance
increases efficiency by reducing leakage loss,
whereas a large tip clearance postpones stall and
provides wider operating range. The performance
of Wells turbine is limited by stall, and in varying
sea condition, a wide operating range is preferable
over the efficiency of turbine.
·
· Impulse turbines required guide vanes to operate on
bidirectional airflow. Variable pitch guide vanes have
better performance than fixed guide vanes in terms of
wider operating range and higher efficiency.
·
· Radial turbines are complex in operation and main-
tenance, whereas the axial turbines are simple in
Figure 14. Comparison of efficiency between reference and
different optimized cases (Badhurshah and Samad, 2015).

surrogate predicted model (Badhurshah and Samad, 2014).

blade profile (Mohamed et al., 2011).

operation and possess higher peak efficiency than
the radial turbines.
·
· A comparison between Wells and impulse turbine
shows that Wells turbine with guide vane provides
maximum peak efficiency, whereas axial-impulse
turbine with variable pitch guide vanes results in
maximum operating range.
·
· Optimization of OWC turbines is a relatively new
area of research. Heuristic methods are preferred in
numerical methods for air turbine optimization.
·
· Optimized blade shape for both Wells and impulse
turbines gives better performance than reference
turbine.
·
· For impulse turbine, optimization is carried out for
number of blades and guide vanes; for Wells tur-
bine, optimization is done for blade pitch angle,
blade sweep angle, and turbine speed. Optimized
geometry shows overall performance improvement
in all the cases.
·
· Most of the works on air turbine considered the tur-
bine geometry separately. However, the perfor-
mance of air turbine is influenced greatly by the
hydrodynamics of the OWC. As a future research, it
is suggested to analyze the performance of OWC
along with the air turbines.
