OBJECTIVE -- To estimate the percent and number of overweight adults in the U.S. with
prediabetes who would be potential candidates for diabetes prevention as per the American
Diabetes Association Position Statement (12).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988­1994) and projected our esti-
mates to the year 2000. We defined impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 2-h glucose 140­199
mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose (IFG; fasting glucose 110­125 mg/dl), and prediabetes (IGT or
IFG) per American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. The ADA recently recommended that all
overweight people (BMI 25 kg/m2) who are 45 years of age with prediabetes could be
potential candidates for diabetes prevention, as could prediabetic people aged 25 years with
risk factors. In NHANES III, 2-h postload glucose concentrations were done only among subjects
aged 40­74 years. Because we were interested in overweight people who had both the 2-h
glucose and fasting glucose tests, we limited our estimates of IGT, IFG, and prediabetes to those
aged 45­74 years.
RESULTS -- Overall, 17.1% of overweight adults aged 45­74 years had IGT, 11.9% had IFG,
22.6% had prediabetes, and 5.6% had both IGT and IFG. Based on those data, we estimated that
in the year 2000, 9.1 million overweight adults aged 45­74 had IGT, 5.8 million had IFG, 11.9
million had prediabetes, and 3.0 million had IGT and IFG.
CONCLUSIONS -- Almost 12 million overweight individuals aged 45­74 years in the U.S.
may benefit from diabetes prevention interventions. The number will be substantially higher if
estimation is extended to individuals aged 75 and 25­44 years.

Type 2 diabetes, which has devastat-
ing consequences on life expect-
ancy, morbidity, and quality of life
and imposes large economic costs, cur-
rently affects 16 million persons in the
U.S.--a number that is projected to in-
crease (1­3). Despite major advances in
the treatment of glycemia, risk factors for
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other
diabetes complications, type 2 diabetes
remains a chronic degenerative condition
that is difficult to treat (4). Prevention of
diabetes is thus a worthy public health
goal, especially because the diabetes pan-
demic is linked to contemporary lifestyle
(5). Although literature from the last de-
cade indicated that lifestyle interventions
may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabe-
tes, evidence from randomized controlled
trials has been lacking (6).
Now four recent randomized con-
trolled trials, performed across diverse
countries, settings, and populations, have
provided evidence that the progression
from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to
type 2 diabetes can be delayed or pre-
vented (7­11). The most compelling evi-
dence so far is from the recently published
Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in the
U.S. (9,10). The DPP was a 27-center,
randomized controlled clinical trial that
included a diverse group of 3,200 adults
aged 25 years with a BMI 24 kg/m2
and IGT. The trial found that modest
weight loss and changes in lifestyle re-
duced the 3-year incidence of type 2 dia-
betes by 58%, and that the drug
metformin reduced the risk by 31% (10).
The DPP showed that it was possible to
prevent or delay diabetes among individ-
uals at high risk for diabetes, regardless of
age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
The success of these major diabetes
prevention trials is clearly a call for action
(5). Although these trials focused on
adults with IGT, the American Diabetes
Association (ADA) has recently recom-
mended that all overweight people (BMI
25 kg/m2) aged 45 years with predi-
abetes (IGT or impaired fasting glucose
[IFG]) be considered potential candidates
for diabetes prevention, as well as over-
weight younger individuals with predia-
betes and other risk factors (12). As a first
public health step, we need to determine
how many individuals in the U.S. may
benefit from such interventions. These
data will help assess resource needs, plan
resource allocation, target the delivery of
interventions, and provide baseline data
for monitoring national diabetes preven-
tion programs.
In our study, we wanted to estimate
how many individuals in the U.S. could
be eligible for diabetes prevention inter-

vention as per the recent ADA Position
Statement (12). To do this, we projected
total and strata-specific (e.g., age, sex, and
race/ethnicity) estimates of IGT, IFG, and
prediabetes for the year 2000 using data
from the nationally representative Third
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III), which was
conducted from 1988 through 1994, and
year 2000 U.S. census estimates.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NHANES III was a sur-
vey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
U.S. population that followed a complex
sampling design, including oversampling
of blacks and Mexican-Americans
(13,14). Home interviews, physical ex-
aminations, and laboratory examinations
were performed on 34,000 persons
aged 2 months. Adults were randomly
assigned to either morning or afternoon
sessions for physical and laboratory ex-
aminations. Only those who participated
in the morning session were eligible for
the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
and fasting glucose test; therefore, we lim-
ited our analyses to this population. Of
the 6,974 participants aged 25 years
who were randomly assigned to the
morning, 572 reported a previous diag-
nosis of diabetes when not pregnant and
6,402 did not. After a 9- to 24-h fasting
period, a blood sample was obtained from
5,830 (91.1%) of the participants without
self-reported diabetes. Of the participants
who gave a fasting blood sample, 2,426
were between ages 45 and 74 years, the
age group to which OGTT was restricted.
After a 2-h (15 min) 75-g glucose chal-
lenge, a second blood sample was ob-
tained from 2,269 (93.5%) participants in
that age group.
We assessed other information from
the participants, including demographics
and risk factors for CVD. Being over-
weight was defined as having a BMI 25
kg/m2 (12). Dyslipidemia was defined as
an HDL concentration 45 mg/dl in men
or 55 mg/dl in women, a total choles-
terol concentration 200 mg/dl, an LDL
concentration 100 mg/dl, or a fasting
triglyceride concentration 200 mg/dl or
as having ever been prescribed medica-
tion for high cholesterol (15,16). Hyper-
tension was classified as having an
elevated blood pressure (systolic 140
mmHg or diastolic 90 mmHg) or as
having ever been prescribed medication
for hypertension (17). Microalbuminuria
was determined by a urinary albumin
concentration 30 g/ml (18). Smoking
meant being a current smoker and having
smoked 100 cigarettes during one's life-
time.
Aside from adults with self-reported
diabetes, all analyses were conducted
among overweight adults aged 45­74
years who received both the fasting glu-
cose test and a 2-h glucose challenge.
Adults without self-reported diabetes
were classified as having undiagnosed di-
abetes if their 2-h glucose concentration
was 200 mg/dl and/or their fasting glu-
cose concentration was 126 mg/dl
(19,20). We used the term "prediabetes"
to identify adults without diabetes who
had IGT (2-h glucose concentration of
140­199 mg/dl) or IFG (fasting glucose
concentration 110 ­125 mg/dl)
(12,19,20). The prevalence of IGT, IFG,
prediabetes, and IGT plus IFG was esti-
mated among overweight adults aged
45­74 years. A comparison of people
with prediabetes with people meeting
DPP criteria for IGT (IGT plus fasting glu-
cose of 95­125 mg/dl) (9) across several
demographic and clinical characteristics
was also performed. To project 1988­
1994 NHANES III estimates to the year
2000, we applied the respective preva-
lences of self-reported diabetes and being
overweight, undiagnosed diabetes and
being overweight, and prediabetes and
being overweight to year 2000 population
estimates (21). SUDAAN software was
used to account for the complex sampling
design of the survey (22). All analyses ac-
counted for the clustered sampling design
and oversampling and were adjusted for
differential noncoverage and nonre-
sponse (13,14).
RESULTS -- Among overweight adults
aged 45­74 years, 12.5% had self-
reported diabetes (the corresponding
U.S. population projection for 2000 is 6.7
million persons), 10.8% (5.7 million) had
undiagnosed diabetes, 22.6% (11.9 mil-
lion) had prediabetes, 17.1% (9.1 mil-
lion) had IGT, 11.1% (5.8 million) had
IFG, 5.6% (3.0 million) had both IGT and
IFG (Table 1), and 54.1% (38.4 million)
had normal glucose metabolism. In all,
14.4% or 7.3 million people met DPP IGT
criteria. Among the overweight adults
aged 45­74 years with prediabetes,
50% had IGT only; 25% had IFG only
or IGT and IFG combined (Fig. 1).
The prevalence of impaired metabo-
lism states was similar by sex and by race/
ethnicity, with two exceptions (Table 1).
Mexican-American men were more than
twice as likely as Mexican-American
women to have IFG (16.5 vs. 7.6%), and
the prevalence of prediabetes was higher
among Mexican-Americans than among
non-Hispanic blacks (27.3 vs. 18.9%).
There were a few differences in char-
acteristics across the metabolic states (Ta-
ble 2). Among overweight adults aged
45­74 years, a higher proportion of men
than women had IFG (55.4 vs. 44.6%).
Compared with adults with IFG, adults
with IGT had a lower mean weight (83.5
vs. 87.3 kg) and a lower mean waist cir-
cumference (103.3 vs. 106.1 cm). Among
adults with prediabetes, the prevalence of
CVD risk factors was high: 94.9% had
dyslipidemia, 56.5% had hypertension,
13.9% had microalbuminuria, and 16.6%
were current smokers. People with predi-
abetes had characteristics that were re-
markably similar to those with DPP IGT
(IGT plus fasting glucose 95­125 mg/dl)
across several demographic and clinical
variables; the only exception was that
people with prediabetes had lower 2-h
glucose concentrations (149.7 vs. 164.1
mg/dl).
CONCLUSIONS -- Overall, 25%
of overweight adults aged 45­74 years
had prediabetes, which translates into
about 12 million persons in the U.S. in the
year 2000. Recent controlled trials on di-
abetes prevention have confirmed that
lifestyle changes such as diet, weight loss,
and exercise as well as the drug met-
formin can substantially delay or prevent
the progression from impaired metabo-
lism to type 2 diabetes (7­10). Thus, sev-
eral million individuals could benefit
from diabetes prevention intervention.
Furthermore, in the process of identifying
those with prediabetes, we estimated that
an additional 6.5 million persons with
undiagnosed diabetes would be detected.
We compared the characteristics of
individuals with IGT in the population
represented by NHANES III with those of
individuals with IGT recruited in the DPP
(10,23). As previously reported (23), the
DPP sample was younger and had a lower
proportion of men, a lower proportion of
nonminority groups, a higher mean BMI,
lower mean lipid concentrations, a lower
proportion of smokers, but roughly simi-
lar mean fasting glucose (106.5 vs. 104.2
mg/dl) and mean 2-h glucose concentra-

tion (164.9 vs. 161.9 mg/dl). Although
the DPP population had a higher propor-
tion of minority groups, the DPP research-
ers found that lifestyle and metformin
interventions worked equally well across
all race/ethnic groups (10). Of interest is
the fact that people with prediabetes had
remarkably similar characteristics to
those with IGT in the DPP trial (IGT plus
fasting glucose 95­125 mg/dl) across sev-
eral demographic and clinical variables.
To date, no diabetes prevention trial
has been conducted solely among persons
with IFG, although each of the recent tri-
als included some persons with IGT who
also had IFG. Both conditions indicate
prediabetes (12), and the two states over-
lap somewhat, but are not identical. In
our study, 25% of those with prediabetes
had both IGT and IFG; yet we found that
demographic and CVD risk factor profiles
were similar between those with IGT and
IFG except for some differences in gender
distribution, mean weight, and mean
waist circumference. In the Hoorn study
(24), the conversion rate from IGT to di-
abetes and from IFG to diabetes was fairly
similar (57.9/1,000 vs. 51.4/1,000 per-
son-years).
The risk of diabetes is strongly linked
to contemporary lifestyle, which is
heavily influenced by socioeconomic and
cultural factors; diabetogenic lifestyles are
also ubiquitous (4,5). It is intuitive to ar-
gue that a diabetes prevention approach
aimed at the entire population rather than
one targeted at a high-risk group should
be adopted. However, several factors sup-
port an aggressive, DPP-like approach
targeting high-risk persons (defined by
IGT or IFG in overweight adults). For ex-
ample, in the total population serum glu-
cose concentrations were bimodally
distributed (19), and the threshold for di-
abetes risk coincided with the onset of
prediabetes. Using data reported in the
Hoorn study (24), we estimated that al-
though 8% of that study population had
IGT, 40% of incident cases of diabetes oc-
curred among subjects with IGT, and al-
though 10% had IFG, 42% of incident
cases occurred among subjects with IFG.
In addition, most, if not all, individuals who
develop type 2 diabetes pass through IGT
or IFG; this phase offers an opportunity to
efficiently identify those at imminent risk
of developing diabetes. Moreover, in our
analysis, the prevalence of certain CVD
risk factors (e.g., dyslipidemia and hyper-
tension) among those with IGT or IFG
was very high; lifestyle interventions in
this group may help prevent CVD, in ad-
dition to delaying or preventing the devel-
opment of diabetes.

The NHANES III data posed some ad-
vantages and disadvantages for our anal-
yses. It was advantageous that the data
were nationally representative and had
standardized laboratory, clinical, and
physical measurements. However, the
fact that limited data were available on
racial/ethnic groups at high risk for diabe-
tes (e.g., Native Americans), and that no
2-h glucose data from adults ages 40
years and 75 years were available was
disadvantageous. In addition, we might
have underestimated the true size of the
U.S. population at risk for diabetes be-
cause the proportions of overweight and
diabetic adults have increased since the
NHANES III was conducted (25). We
have estimated that in 2000, among over-
weight Americans aged 45­74 years, 9.1
million had IGT, 5.8 million had IFG, and
11.9 million had prediabetes.
There is strong evidence for substan-
tially delaying or preventing diabetes
among overweight adults with IGT. The
ADA has recommended that all over-
weight people aged 45 years with pre-
diabetes are potential candidates for
diabetes prevention (12). To what extent
other people with abnormal glucose tol-
erance (e.g., those with IFG) would re-
spond similarly to subjects that
participated in the clinical trials of pre-
vention (7­11) is not clear. In any case,
our estimates suggest that very large num-
bers of people at risk for diabetes may
benefit from diabetes prevention inter-
ventions; our estimates may also be con-
servative, because data were not available
for all age groups. The immediate chal-
lenge is to translate research evidence for
diabetes prevention into practice and pol-
icy. Questions remain about which
groups may benefit and by how much
from diabetes interventions, the most ef-
ficient means to identify these groups,
and the most effective ways to deliver and
sustain interventions.
