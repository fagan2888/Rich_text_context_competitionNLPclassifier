Abstract
Objectives. The objective of this study was to esti-
mate the societal costs of prescription opioid abuse,
dependence, and misuse in the United States.
Methods. Costs were grouped into three catego-
ries: health care, workplace, and criminal justice.
Costs were estimated by 1) quantity method, which
multiplies the number of opioid abuse patients by
cost per opioid abuse patient; and 2) apportionment
method, which begins with overall costs of drug
abuse per component and apportions the share
associated with prescription opioid abuse based on
relative prevalence of prescription opioid to overall
drug abuse. Excess health care costs per patient
were based on claims data analysis of privately
insured and Medicaid beneficiaries. Other data/
information were derived from publicly available
survey and other secondary sources.
Results. Total US societal costs of prescription
opioid abuse were estimated at $55.7 billion in 2007
(USD in 2009). Workplace costs accounted for $25.6
billion (46%), health care costs accounted for $25.0
billion (45%), and criminal justice costs accounted
for $5.1 billion (9%). Workplace costs were driven by
lost earnings from premature death ($11.2 billion)
and reduced compensation/lost employment ($7.9
billion). Health care costs consisted primarily of
excess medical and prescription costs ($23.7
billion). Criminal justice costs were largely com-
prised of correctional facility ($2.3 billion) and police
costs ($1.5 billion).
Conclusions. The costs of prescription opioid
abuse represent a substantial and growing eco-
nomic burden for the society. The increasing preva-
lence of abuse suggests an even greater societal
burden in the future.

Introduction
In recent years, the abuse, dependence, and misuse of
prescription drugs has become a growing public health
concern in the United States. National estimates from the
2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
reported that 12.5 million Americans had used prescrip-
tion pain relievers for nonmedical purposes, up from 11.0
million in 2002 [1]. Of this 12.5 million population, approxi-
mately 1.7 million met the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for abuse or
dependence [2]. The 2007 Treatment Episodes Data Set
(TEDS) reported that the number of patients admitted to
substance abuse treatment facilities due to nonheroin
opiate/opioid abuse nearly quadrupled from 23,000 to
more than 90,000 from 1999 to 2007 [3]. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2009 that
opioid-related poisoning deaths have more than tripled
since 1999 [4]. The growing prevalence of prescription
opioid abuse, dependence, and misuse ("opioid abuse") is
discussed further in White et al. [5].
As part of the effort to curb the growth of opioid abuse, 34
states have initiated prescription drug monitoring pro-
grams (PDMPs) with the purpose of identifying drug abuse
and diversion [6]. Furthermore, the Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) has recently required certain opioid manu-
facturers to develop a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy (REMS) to manage potentially risky prescription
drugs and ensure that their benefits outweigh their risks
[7]. Despite these initiatives to address opioid abuse,
research on the societal economic burden of opioid abuse
is limited (e.g., caregiver burden and presenteeism are
ignored, as are aspects of the cost to the criminal justice
system). Studies by the Office of National Drug Control
Policy (ONDCP) and the National Center on Addiction and
Pain Medicine 2011; 12: 657­667

Substance Abuse report that the overall costs of drug
abuse are substantial, but do not quantify the societal
burden of opioid abuse specifically [8,9].
In a recent review of the literature, Strassels documented
the high costs associated with opioid abuse and cited the
estimate by Birnbaum et al. that the societal costs of
opioid abuse in 2001 were $11.8 billion; approximately
53% ($6.3 billion, all costs in 2009 USD) of these costs
was attributable to lost workplace productivity, 30% ($3.6
billion) to health care, and 17% ($2.0 billion) to criminal
justice [10,11]. Focusing specifically on the health care
component, White et al. found that during 1998­2002, the
excess (i.e., relative to matched controls) annual health
care costs per opioid abuse patient in a privately insured
population were $17,768, while the diagnosed prevalence
of opioid abuse increased from 0.05% to 0.08% during
that period [12]. Among Medicaid patients, McAdam-
Marx et al. reported costs per abuse patient during 2002­
2003 of $18,379 vs $10,952 for controls, and estimated
the diagnosed prevalence of opioid abuse in the Medicaid
population at 0.87% [13].
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the societal
costs associated with prescription opioid abuse in the
United States in 2007, drawing on data from a number of
different sources. Specifically, this research updates and
expands on previous research [11] by including the
burden on caregivers (i.e., spouses and dependents of
insurance subscribers) as well as additional criminal
justice and lost productivity components (e.g., presentee-
ism costs). The results are disaggregated into three
primary categories: health care, criminal justice, and lost
workplace productivity.
Methods
Data
This study relied on administrative claims data and on
publicly available secondary sources [1,3,5,8,9,14­32] to
estimate the societal costs of prescription opioid abuse
(see Table 1). All data presented are from the most recent
survey or data set for which they are reported, through
2007. For all cost estimates, data are converted to the
most recently available year, 2009 USD using the relevant
consumer price index (CPI) or hourly compensation index
(HCI) (e.g., the CPI for Medical Care was used to adjust
health care costs, the HCI was used to adjust wages for
work loss costs, and the All Items CPI was used for other
cost adjustments) published by the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics. Administrative claims data were used to estimate
excess medical and prescription drug costs as well as
excess medically related absenteeism and disability costs
for patients diagnosed with opioid abuse. Secondary
sources, including academic research, government
surveys and publications, and private/nonprofit research,
were used in calculating substance abuse treatment, pre-
vention and research costs, criminal justice costs, and lost
workplace productivity costs. The manner in which these
sources were used in context of the cost calculations is
described below (see Cost Analysis section).
De-identified administrative claims data used here
included a large privately insured population and the
Florida Medicaid beneficiaries. The privately insured data-
base covers approximately nine million lives, for services
provided during 1999 through 2007, and contains infor-
mation from 40 self-insured companies, which operate
nationwide in a broad array of industries and job classifi-
cations. The data include demographic and enrollment
information as well as medical, prescription drug, and
disability claims for all beneficiaries (i.e., employees,
spouses, and dependents). The medical claims contain
diagnoses based on codes from the International Classi-
fication of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM), dates, place, type of service, and amounts
paid to providers. The drug claims contain information on
all prescriptions such as fill date, National Drug Code,
days of supply, quantity, and amount paid.
The Florida Medicaid data cover all Medicaid-eligible ben-
eficiaries (over six million lives) between Q3:1997­
Q2:2006. The information contained in the Medicaid data
is similar to that of the privately insured claims data,
although it was not possible to link information at the
family level to identify caregivers.
Study Sample: Claims Data
Three study samples were identified and matched to con-
trols: privately insured opioid abuse patients (and a subset
of abuse patients who were employed with available work
loss data), caregivers of privately insured opioid abuse
patients, and Florida Medicaid opioid abuse patients.
Patients were classified as having opioid abuse by identi-
fying those persons with at least one medical claim asso-
ciated with at least one ICD-9-CM diagnosis for opioid
abuse during 2003­2007 (the first such diagnosis was
defined as the index date): 304.0 (opioid type depen-
dence), 304.7 (combinations of opioid type dependence
with any other drug dependence), 305.5 (opioid abuse),
and 965.0 (poisoning by opiates and related narcotics)
excluding 965.01 (poisoning by heroin). Opioid abuse
patients were required to have at least 6 months of con-
tinuous eligibility pre- and postindex date and be 12­64
years old on their index date.
Many definitions of opioid abuse and dependence exist in
the literature, with little agreement on which is correct.
Note that this study focuses on costs of patients diag-
nosed with opioid abuse, consistent with White et al., and
therefore does not account for undiagnosed opioid abuse
patients [12]. Where data on diagnosed abuse was
unavailable (which it was for many secondary sources),
this study relied on the DSM-IV definition of abuse/
dependence, to the extent possible.

patient, excluding any with a diagnosis for opioid abuse in
their claims history) who had at least one medical or drug
claim during 2003­2007 were selected and assigned the
same index date as their associated opioid abuse patient.
Similar age and eligibility requirements were imposed.
All three samples were matched randomly one-to-one to
controls on exact demographic characteristics (age,
gender, geographic location, employment status for pri-
vately insured, and race for Medicaid). Controls were
selected as patients who did not have any diagnoses
associated with opioid abuse in their claims history, were
not considered a caregiver of an opioid abuse patient, had
at least one medical or drug claim during the study period,
and met similar age and eligibility requirements. Controls
were identified and assigned for all opioid abuse patients.

and Charlson Comorbidity Index of the claims data
samples.
Cost Analysis
Previous studies of the costs of substance abuse provide a
useful framework for identifying the major cost categories
of health care, criminal justice, and lost workplace produc-
tivity [8,9,11]. A prevalence-based estimation approach
was used except when estimating productivity losses due
to premature death, in which total costs were assigned to
the year in which the death occurred. While each category
consisted of multiple components that required specific
calculations, following previous research, two general
approaches were used to estimate costs: 1) a quantity
method and (2) an apportionment method [11]. The quan-
tity method multiplies the estimated cost per opioid abuse
patient by the relevant number of opioid abuse patients.
The apportionment method begins with the overall cost of
drug abuse for a particular cost component (taken from a
secondary data source) and allocates a cost associated
with opioid abuse based on its prevalence relative to overall
abuse, as estimated from the number of persons reporting
abuse or dependence on prescription opioids in the past
12 months in the 2007 NSDUH. Table 1 provides the data
sources for each of the cost analysis methods used for
each cost category described below.
Health Care Costs
Health care costs consist of excess medical and drug
costs, and substance abuse treatment, prevention, and
research costs. Excess medical and drug costs were cal-
culated for both privately insured (Table 1, source [A]) and
Florida Medicaid (Table 1, source [B]) opioid abuse
patients and privately insured caregivers using the quantity
method: excess per-patient costs (costs of patients minus
controls derived from actual amounts paid to providers
from the claims data) were calculated for all three patient
groups, then multiplied by the relevant number of opioid
abuse patients (derived from NSDUH {Table 1, source
[G]}, who are apportioned to private insurance and Med-
icaid using TEDS {Table 1, source [H]}), or caregivers
(derived as the ratio of caregivers to opioid abuse patients
in the privately insured sample {Table 1, source [A]}). To
account for differences between Florida Medicaid patients
and the national population insured by Medicaid, costs of
Florida Medicaid opioid abuse patients were nationally
adjusted using the ratio of average spending per Florida

Medicaid beneficiary to spending per US Medicaid ben-
eficiary (Table 1, source [E]). Excess medical and drug
costs for Medicare and uninsured opioid abuse patients
and their caregivers were estimated by applying a national
Medicaid-to-Medicare spending ratio (Table 1, sources [D]
and [E]) and a privately insured-to-uninsured spending
ratio (Table 1, source [C]), respectively.
Treatment, prevention, and research costs were calcu-
lated using the apportionment method, by identifying total
federal, state, local, and private expenditures on sub-
stance abuse treatment, prevention, and research
(Table 1, sources [I], [J], and [L]) and multiplying by the
proportion associated with opioids (based on the preva-
lence of opioid abuse relative to overall drug abuse;
Table 1, sources [G], [F], and [H]).
Criminal Justice Costs
Calculations for criminal justice costs used the apportion-
ment method to estimate spending associated with opioid
abuse on police protection, legal and adjudication, cor-
rectional facilities, and property lost due to crime. For each
cost component, total spending was identified using data
from the Criminal Justice Expenditures and Employment
Extract Program (Table 1, source [P]) and the proportion
related to opioid abuse was estimated based on the ratio
of arrests (for police protection and legal and adjudication
components) or incarcerations (for correctional facilities
component) attributable to opioid abuse. Arrests or incar-
cerations attributable to opioid abuse were estimated by
first apportioning total arrests or incarcerations for drug
law violations and other income-generating and violent
crimes (Table 1, sources [M], [O], [R]) to overall drug abuse
using published attribution factors (e.g., 100% of drug
violations and 30% of burglaries are attributable to drug
abuse; Table 1, source [T]), and then apportioning further
by multiplying by the ratio of opioid abuse relative to
overall drug abuse (Table 1, source [G]) for income-
generating and violent crimes, and by the ratio of prescrip-
tion opioids identified as a percentage of all controlled and
uncontrolled substances secured in law enforcement
operations (Table 1, source [Q]) for drug law violations.
Lost Workplace Productivity Costs
Lost workplace productivity costs using the human capital
approach were calculated using both the quantity and
apportionment methods [33]. Similar to excess medical
and drug costs, excess medically related absenteeism
(i.e., days of lost work due to medical utilization multiplied
by daily wage) and disability (i.e., days of lost work due to
disability multiplied by daily benefits received) costs were
calculated for privately insured employed opioid abuse
patients and extrapolated using the quantity method,
which multiplies per-patient costs by the number of
employees with opioid abuse (Table 1, sources [A], [G]
and [H]). Presenteeism costs (i.e., diminished on-the-job
productivity) were calculated for employees with opioid
abuse and for employed caregivers using a ratio approach
used in Goetzel et al. [31] that estimates average presen-
teeism costs as a percentage of total medical, drug,
absenteeism, and disability costs (Table 1, source [Y]).
Lost productivity due to incarceration was estimated by
multiplying the per inmate cost of incarceration, in terms of
lost wages (calculated as the weighted average of annual
expected earnings; Table 1, sources [W] and [U]), by the
number of inmates incarcerated for crimes attributable to
opioid abuse (described above; Table 1, sources [M], [O],
[T], [Q], and [G]). The costs of lost wages/employment
were calculated using the apportionment method, by mul-
tiplying total lost wages due to lower wages and higher
unemployment associated with all drug abuse (Table 1,
sources [T] and [V]) by the proportion associated with
opioid abuse (Table 1, source [G]).
Finally, consistent with Birnbaum et al. [11], the costs of
premature death were calculated by estimating the net
present value of lifetime earnings (using a 6% discount
rate; Table 1, sources [W], [U]), weighted by age and
gender (Table 1, source [X]) and multiplying by the number
of deaths related to opioid abuse identified from the Drug
Abuse Warning Network (DAWN; Table 1, source [K]).
Results
The total societal costs of prescription opioid abuse in
2007 were calculated to be $55.7 billion, of which lost
workplace productivity contributed $25.6 billion, health
care costs contributed $25.0 billion, and criminal justice
costs accounted for the remaining $5.1 billion (Figure 1).
Table 3 shows cost estimates for all components of health
care, criminal justice, and workplace costs.
Lost Workplace Productivity Costs
Lost workplace productivity costs contributed the largest
share of total societal costs with approximately $25.6
billion, or 45.9%, of total societal costs. Of the workplace
costs, the cost of premature death was the largest com-
ponent, accounting for $11.2 billion (43.8%), and lost
wages/employment and presenteeism were the next two
costliest components, contributing $7.9 billion (31.0%) and
$2.0 billion (8.0%), respectively. Excess medically related
absenteeism and incarceration costs accounted for com-
parable amounts at $1.8 billion (7.1%) and $1.8 billion
(6.9%), respectively, while excess disability costs
accounted for only $807 million (3.2%). Employees with
opioid abuse accounted for 64.5% and 90.1% of excess
medically related absenteeism and disability costs, while
caregivers contributed the remaining 35.5% and 9.9%,
respectively.
Health Care Costs
Health care costs accounted for approximately $25.0
billion, or 44.9%, of total societal costs, of which excess
medical and drug costs were the main drivers, contributing
$23.7 billion (94.9%). Opioid abuse patients accounted
for over 92% of excess medical and drug costs, with
their caregivers accounting for the remainder. Medicaid
661
Societal Costs of Prescription Opioid Abuse
patients and caregivers combined contributed approxi-
mately one-third of total excess medical and drug costs,
privately insured and uninsured patients and caregivers
contributed slightly less than one-third each, and Medicare
patients and caregivers accounted for only 4.6%.
Of total health care costs, substance abuse treatment,
prevention, and research all contributed a substantially
smaller amount, accounting for costs of $1.1 billion
(4.5%), $85 million (0.3%), and $69 million (0.3%), respec-
tively. Substance abuse research and prevention expen-
ditures together contributed merely 0.3% of the total
societal costs, with the majority of funding provided by
federal sources. Treatment, in contrast, contributed a
slightly larger share of the total, 2.0%, and consisted
primarily of state and local expenditures, followed by
federal and private funding.
Criminal Justice Costs
Criminal justice costs contributed approximately $5.1
billion, or 9.2% of the total societal costs, of which cor-
rectional facilities accounted for the largest share with
$2.3 billion (44.1%). Of these correctional facility costs,
nearly two-thirds were incurred at the state level. Of total
criminal justice costs, police protection contributed $1.5
billion (29.7%), legal and adjudication costs accounted for
$726 million (14.1%), and the costs associated with prop-
erty lost due to crime accounted for $625 million (12.2%).
Discussion
The results of this analysis document that the growing
problem of prescription opioid abuse places a substantial
economic burden on society, specifically in the realms
of health care, criminal justice, and lost workplace
productivity.
Implications
These findings provide further evidence that prescription
opioid abuse is an increasing and substantial burden on
society that needs to be addressed in a comprehensive
manner. As discussed above, the impact of opioid abuse
not only affects the health outcomes and costs of the US
population ($25.0 billion), but also imposes a large eco-
nomic burden on the workplace ($25.6 billion), the justice
system ($5.1 billion), and society as a whole ($55.7
billion). Although differences in data and methods pre-
clude exact comparison with previous societal estimates
[11], it is clear that the costs of opioid abuse have
increased substantially due to changes in the prevalence
of opioid abuse and associated costs. Key changes
include, for example, increases from 2001 to 2007

Societal Costs of Prescription Opioid Abuse
(compared with Birnbaum et al. [11]) in the prevalence of
opioid abuse (approximately 13%), the excess cost per
opioid abuse patient (47% after adjusting for inflation), the
cost of substance abuse treatment (up to 48%), the pro-
portion of substance abuse admissions attributable to
opioids (138%), and total police and legal expenditures
(16% and 10%, respectively).
Reducing the substantial economic burden of prescription
opioid abuse will require sustained efforts from academic
researchers, industry, health care providers, and govern-
ment to implement appropriate actions. A number of ini-
tiatives to reduce the prevalence of opioid abuse are
already underway. For example, government initiatives
such as the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic
Reporting Act (NASPER) have allocated funding for the
creation and enhancement of state PDMPs [34]. The FDA
now requires the preparation of a REMS for certain pre-
scription opioid manufacturers. Industry has begun to
manufacture abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, and
clinical initiatives have included the publication and adop-
tion of "universal precautions" for pain management as
well as the development of models to better identify
patients at risk of opioid abuse [35­37].
In particular, the difference between overall societal costs
and the current level of spending on research and preven-
tion is quite substantial, with such expenditures together
accounting for less than 1% of total societal costs. Thus,
increased funding of research and prevention programs
may present an opportunity for new efforts to combat the
escalating problem of prescription opioid abuse. The ben-
efits of investing more resources into these two compo-
nents could be considerable, since adequate prevention
and research programs could later result in reductions in
excess medical and drug costs (estimated at $23.7
billion), treatment costs ($1.1 billion), and other cost com-
ponents previously discussed, such as criminal justice
($5.1 billion) and lost workplace productivity ($25.6 billion).
The adoption of PDMPs to identify patients at risk of
abuse in many states is a step in the right direction, but 16
states still have yet to implement PDMPs, including nine
which have not even passed legislation mandating their
creation [6].
Limitations
Despite the evident growth in prevalence and treatment
admissions associated with opioid abuse, quantifying the
growth in societal costs is not straightforward; recent
improvements in the analytic approaches and changes in
data collection methodology make overall comparison
with previous results difficult [11]. For example, this study
calculates cost categories not previously estimated, such
as those of caregivers, prevention and research, property
lost due to crime, excess medically related absenteeism,
disability, and presenteeism. To further confound the com-
parison, the current study includes costs associated with
opioid dependence as well as abuse (which was the only
aspect of abuse considered previously), and criminal
justice costs here include those associated with violent
crime. Some secondary data sources, such as DAWN and
NSDUH, also have updated their methodologies. To the
extent that comparisons can be made, claims data esti-
mates are consistent with prior research and suggest an
increase in the costs of abuse, even after controlling for
inflation.
There are several other limitations to this study. Florida
Medicaid figures are not representative of the national
Medicaid population, as Florida spends only $4,487 per
Medicaid enrollee, ranking it 43rd and below the national
average of $5,163 [32]. However, as noted, these data
were adjusted to the US Medicaid population based on a
per enrollee spending ratio.
This study is also limited by the variability among the
distinct secondary data sets. However, adjusting the
opioid abuse-related allocation of a specific component
allowed for increased compatibility among different
sources. For example, when using the apportionment
method to estimate substance abuse prevention costs
associated with prescription opioids, total prevention
costs (which include spending for illicit and prescription
drug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse prevention) were appor-
tioned based on the ratio of NSDUH-reported abuse of
prescription opioids to abuse of illicit drugs, alcohol, or
tobacco, whereas lost wages/employment costs (which
include costs due to illicit drug abuse) were apportioned
based on the ratio of NSDUH-reported abuse of prescrip-
tion opioids to abuse of illicit drugs only. Notwithstanding
this, the different definitions and concepts of opioid abuse
make comparisons across data sets problematic. To the
authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate
the different data sets in one analysis.
In addition to the difficulty in addressing variability
between data sets, the secondary sources used have
their own limitations. Data from DAWN used to calculate
the number of premature deaths associated with opioid
abuse represent drug-related deaths in selected metro-
politan areas and states only, and may not be represen-
tative of drug-related death patterns in areas not
reported. To the authors' knowledge, DAWN data
provide the best available estimate of drug-related
deaths in the United States. Attribution factors from
ONDCP used to apportion arrests and incarcerations
due to drug abuse were developed prior to 2007, and
therefore may not accurately represent the proportion of
arrests and incarcerations attributable to drug abuse.
However, criminal justice costs may be underestimated
because the overall number of reported drug abusers
has grown at a much higher rate than the overall number
of arrests since the development of the attribution
factors. Conversely, in this case, the apportionment
method used may lead to overestimation because pre-
scription opioid abuse may not be associated with the
same likelihood of arrest as abuse of other drugs. Addi-
tionally, presenteeism costs were estimated using a ratio
of average presenteeism costs relative to overall medi-
cal, drug, absenteeism, and disability costs reported
in Goetzel et al. for the 10 most common conditions
664
Birnbaum et al.
examined (e.g., allergies, cancer, depression/mental
illness) [31]. Because opioid abuse specific estimates
were not available, it was assumed that presenteeism
costs for employees with opioid abuse followed the
same ratio.
As noted above, there are various issues in defining opioid
abuse. For example, ICD-9-CM codes do not allow for
differentiation between prescription opioid abuse and
heroin abuse, and therefore, this study likely included both
types of patients. Where possible, heroin abuse was
separated from prescription opioid abuse in cost analyses
using secondary data sources. This study estimates costs
using two general definitions of abuse. First, per-patient
excess medical and drug costs were calculated using a
diagnosis-based definition. This approach captured
patients with abuse, dependence, and misuse (e.g., poi-
soning). Opioid abuse may be underdiagnosed due, in
part, to the associated stigma [38], and therefore the
patient population used to calculate excess costs may not
be representative of the cost profile of undiagnosed
patients with opioid abuse. Second, the number of opioid
abuse patients used to carry out the quantity and appor-
tionment methods was limited to those reported by
NSDUH as meeting the DSM-IV criteria for abuse or
dependence (1.7 million), similar to an ICD-9-CM diagnos-
tic approach to abuse. The absence of cost information
for the approximately 12.5 million nonmedical users of
prescription drugs [1] and their caregivers in the United
States means that this study likely understates both the
excess health care and total societal costs. It is also
important to mention that this study does not attempt to
address causality. While the societal costs refer to those
costs associated with opioids abusers, they may not be
directly attributable to the opioid abuse. For example,
health care costs include costs of comorbidities that are
unrelated to opioid abuse per se. While point estimates of
the various measures of societal cost have not been pre-
sented here, the authors believe the estimates understate
the true economic burden of prescription opioid abuse,
dependence and misuse, and thus these estimates are
conservative.
To better understand how various assumptions impacted
the total societal cost estimate, sensitivity analyses were
conducted. The primary driver of societal costs was the
number of opioid abusers, which is used to multiply costs
per patient in all cost components that use the quantity
method. Changing the number of opioid abusers by
25% impacts the total societal cost estimate by $10
billion ($45.7­65.7 billion). This finding suggests that the
increasing prevalence of opioid abuse may be driving
increases in societal costs. Another key assumption is the
discount rate used in the calculation of the costs of pre-
mature death. For example, if the discount rate were
decreased to 3%, the societal cost estimate would
increase from $55.7 billion to $61.2 billion. While current
market conditions may suggest that a lower rate could be
more appropriate, 6% is consistent with past research [11]
and results in a more conservative cost estimate. A sys-
tematic analysis that varied other major assumptions for
each cost component by 25% (all else equal) found that
no other individual assumption resulted in a change of
more than $2 billion in the overall societal cost estimate.
Future research should attempt to assess other compo-
nents of societal costs that are directly linked to or caused
by prescription opioid abuse not considered here (e.g.,
automobile accidents, insurance fraud, workers compen-
sation) as well as improve understanding of the relation-
ship between opioid abuse and associated comorbidities
(e.g., by studying whether mental illness predates a diag-
nosis of opioid abuse or vice versa). It would also be
informative to analyze the costs of undertreating pain,
which can result from practitioners' concerns about
addiction and abuse [39].
Further efforts to separately categorize prescription and
nonprescription opioid abuse would allow researchers to
better understand illicit opioid use as well as identify pos-
sible sources of distribution. Lastly, it would be useful to
improve the ability to identify patients at risk of opioid
abuse using data similar to that available to PDMPs and
third-party payers, similar to the prototype approach
developed by White et al. but using national data [37].
Such an approach could aid in the development of
national initiatives and research studies toward the pre-
vention of opioid abuse.
As this study has shown, prescription opioid abuse con-
cerns far more than those individuals directly affected by
the condition. It is associated with a myriad of societal
problems related to productivity losses and increasing
criminal and legal justice costs that are rapidly becoming a
major public health and economic concern. A multifac-
eted, coordinated response involving physicians, health
care professionals, researchers (including the pharmaceu-
tical industry), and the government is likely required to
make substantial progress on this serious issue.
