Introduction
Measures of effectiveness in nursing, such as job satisfaction, job
performance, and turnover, have been the focus of nursing-
related research for the last 30 years. Such research has largely
been driven by the need for hospitals to become increasingly
competitive, often in response to a restriction of resources, creat-
ing new challenges in the workplace. Within the context of a
worldwide nurse shortage and high turnover rates (Gandhi,
Sangeetha, Ahmed, & Chaturvedi, 2014; L. Hayes et al., 2006;
Kingsma, 2001; Schiestel, 2007), improving nursing effective-
ness remains an important goal (Pincus, 1986; Wagner,
Bezuidenhout, & Roos, 2015). This global shortage is associated
with a loss of trained nurses, times of poor staffing and extra
work for remaining nurses, increased costs of enrollment and
orientation of new nurses, and, most important, a potential
increase in adverse patient outcomes (Larrabee et al., 2003). Job
satisfaction has been identified as a major determinant of nurse
retention and performance (L. Hayes et al., 2006). Moreover, the
quality of intraorganizational communication and perceived
communication satisfaction influence job satisfaction at different
levels and for all types of employees within the organization.
Aims
We aimed to perform a narrative literature review on job sat-
isfaction in relation to communication satisfaction, with a
specific focus on nursing professionals in hospitals.
Method
We searched the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and
The Cochrane Library through the keywords "communica-
tion," "patient safety," "job satisfaction," "burnout," "com-
munication satisfaction," "nursing," and "nurse turnover,"
which were internally validated by the coauthors. Following

Abstract
Worldwide, nurse shortage and high turnover rates are observed. Job satisfaction is a major determinant of retention and is
influenced by intraorganizational communication and perceived communication satisfaction. This article presents a narrative
review on communication satisfaction, job satisfaction, and their mutual relationship as well as their impact on turnover
intention and burnout risk in the nursing profession. A literature search was conducted in the databases PubMed, Web of
Science, and The Cochrane Library, and 47 articles were included. Descriptive analysis identified different types of social
networks in the health care workplace. There is a positive association between communication and job satisfaction among
nurses, translating into decreased turnover intention and burnout risk. Job satisfaction is required both for organizational
stability as for coguaranteeing patient safety. This will be best achieved through an organization-wide multimodal prevention
and intervention program, aimed at optimizing different modalities of interprofessional communication, workload, and job
satisfaction.

inclusion criteria were maintained: (a) published between
January 1, 1985, and October, 31, 2015; (b) fall into one of
the following categories: original research, reviews, meta-
analyses, or letters to the editor; and (c) available as a full
text in English. Database screening was finished on
November 26, 2015. Inclusion criteria were verified through
title and abstract. The whole article was read if all inclusion
requirements were present or if this was unclear. After read-
ing the full text, papers that did not fulfill all requirements
were excluded. The snowball method was used to search for
additional literature.
Before writing the article, a predesign of five categories
was framed, including interprofessional communication in
health care, deficits in communication and influence on patient
safety, communication satisfaction, job satisfaction and nurse
turnover or burnout, and, finally, recommendations. Papers
were allocated to one or more categories. During the writing
process, each category was addressed separately and all arti-
cles related to a particular category were reread.
Results
The results of the search process are summarized in a
PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1). Out of a total of 4,865
papers selected, 2,161 duplicates were removed. Two thou-
sand seven hundred four records were screened, of which
509 remained for full-text reading. Of the 509, 47 articles
were included in the review.
Interprofessional Communication in Health Care
Within health care, much like any other work context, the
behavior of each individual is influenced by the surrounding
social network. This social network is important for the dis-
semination of information. Social networks are advanta-
geous for people's career and job performance (van Beek
et al., 2011; Wagner et al., 2015).
Van Beek distinguishes three types of social networking
in an organization: communication, consulting, and trust net-
works (van Beek et al., 2011). The communication network
consists of employees who regularly discuss work-related
issues. The advice or consulting network includes employees
who are invoked to solve problems and exchange informa-
tion. The trust network describes those who share and receive
delicate or sensitive information in problem situations.
These networks are important for the provision of quality
care to the patient. In this article, we focus on the communi-
cation networks. Such networks are strongly related to job

satisfaction. Nurses working in units with a close communi-
cation network are more satisfied with their work. In units
with few employees, nurses are more likely to be satisfied
with their work compared with units with many employees
(van Beek et al., 2011). The quality of both communication
and advice networks was negatively related to the number of
nursing staff on units. Job satisfaction differed significantly
interindividually and between units and was influenced by
the number of nursing staff.
Communication and advice networks were denser when
more nurses worked part-time. Furthermore, density of com-
munication networks increased by higher age of the nursing
staff (van Beek et al., 2011).
The health care team is an intact group of caregivers who
are motivated to communicate with each other about the care
of the patients they are entrusted with. Poole and Real subdi-
vided such care teams with regard to their purpose and func-
tion (Real & Poole, 2011). First, the ad hoc team is made up
for a restricted period to solve a problem, after which it disap-
pears. Second, within a nominal care team, patients are
referred by General Practitioners (GPs) to specialists and both
offer independent care. Third, a unidisciplinary team consists
of members of a single discipline. Fourth, a multidisciplinary
team is composed of different disciplines working together,
but the care they offer is sequential. Fifth, an interdisciplinary
team is again composed of different disciplines, this time
working interdependently, that is, they work and communicate
together about the patient's care. Finally, in transdisciplinary
teams, this interdependent collaboration between different dis-
ciplines allows caregivers to transcend competencies in their
own field and to benefit from the skills of the other disciplines
involved in the collaboration. These teams each have their
own particular forms of communication. For caregivers, it is
important to be able to identify with a type of team to know
what the best way to communicate and to work efficiently and
effectively is (Brock et al., 2013; Iseke, 2014; Kudo et al.,
2010; Liu, While, Li, &Ye, 2015; Real & Poole, 2011). Nurses
can belong to different types of teams with their particular
modalities and requirements of communication.
To better understand communication within health care
teams, the input­process­output (IPO) model of communi-
cation in care teams was developed and derived from the
group perspective (Real & Poole, 2011, Figure 2). This
"group dynamics perspective" conveys understanding of
how and why caregivers interact in certain ways and clarifies
how teams function. The model describes communication
structures (inputs) and processes. These, in turn, create out-
puts that can affect the results of the care teams (Brock et al.,
2013; Real & Poole, 2011).
Within health care teams deficient communication can
arise from critical information not being communicated
between team members, conflicting relationships, or a lack
of clarity on roles and job descriptions. Misinterpretation of
information can be caused by the use of different terminol-
ogy or the provision of incomplete information. Although a
whole team delivers medical care, medical quality and safety
have mainly been centered on individual expert practitioners
(Leonard, Graham, & Bonacum, 2004). According to
Leonard et al., "Effective communication and teamwork is
assumed, however formal training and assessment in these
areas has been largely absent" (Leonard et al., 2004, p. i85).
Recognition that the clinical care environment has become
progressively more complex, combined with the inherent
limitations of human performance, has spurred interest in
applying the lessons of other high-reliability industries to
medicine (Leonard et al., 2004). Many factors contribute to
Figure 2. Input/process/output model of communication in health care teams (Real & Poole, 2011) .

communication failures, which are "the leading cause of
inadvertent patient harm" (Aiken et al., 2012). In the first
place, doctors and nurses are trained to communicate in a
different way (Amestoy et al., 2014; Debra, 1991). Nurses
are taught to be rather comprehensive and narrative in their
descriptions of clinical situations, whereas physicians need
to be very concise, and quickly get to the "headlines." Nurses
often report that they are told during their education that they
"don't make diagnoses." So, in mutual contacts, the doctors
impatiently "wait to find out what the nurses want" (Finn,
2001). In addition, the hierarchy within the team can also
cause disturbances in communication. Leadership with
strong authority often leads to less communication within the
team. In contrast, leadership that is able to handle the hierar-
chy appropriately, by creating a trustworthy and secure envi-
ronment, ensures faster communication and more
participation within the team (Leonard et al., 2004).
Inadequate or incorrect information during a shift handover
may also cause communication problems. A final potential
risk area for miscommunication involves any transfer of the
patient from one care point to the other (Greenberg et al.,
2007).
Deficits in Communication and Influence on
Patient Safety
Effective communication and teamwork are essential to pro-
vide high-quality care and patient safety (Vermeir et al.,
2015). Poor communication can lead to various negative out-
comes, such as discontinuity of care and compromise of
patient safety (Vermeir et al., 2015). The complexity of med-
ical care along with the limitations of human action reinforce
the importance of standardized communication and a secure
environment, in which team members can express their con-
cerns about patient safety. In such an environment, members
can speak freely and critical language can be used to create
alertness and to avoid confusion (Brock et al., 2013; Kalisch,
Lee, & Rochman, 2010; Leonard et al., 2004).
Interprofessional teamwork is achieved by the interactive
efforts of all team members involved through good commu-
nication and respect for the role of all team members. There
should be room for the contribution of each team member.
Not only the technical skills of the team, such as knowledge
and experience, contribute to improving patient safety, but
also nontechnical skills, such as communication, team size,
the psychological mind-set, and the way the team is run, can
affect team performance. Despite the increased emphasis on
these nontechnical skills, communication problems remain a
frequent cause of reduced patient safety (Brock et al., 2013;
Courtenay, Nancarrow, & Dawson, 2013; Keith, Coburn, &
Mahoney, 1998; Leonard et al., 2004).
Communication takes place within and between systems,
as exemplified in inpatient, transmural, and outpatient care
and within the chain of pre-, intra-, and postoperative care.
Communication may involve a large group of people such as
surgeons, nurses, support staff, anesthesiologists, and include
a range of critical issues, such as patient status, intraopera-
tive events, and care plan. Most communication deficits
occur within a single department, but can also occur between
departments and between different institutions. The majority
of errors in communication result from verbal communica-
tion. Reducing the number of communication errors could
significantly reduce the number of medical errors and, hence,
increase patient safety (Finn, 2001; Gandhi et al., 2014;
Greenberg et al., 2007; Mrayyan, 2006).
Medical errors, especially those caused by communica-
tion failures, are an omnipresent problem in today's health
care organizations. In the perioperative period for instance,
the prevalence of communication deficiencies is high. In an
observational study of 48 surgical cases with 421 identified
communication events, one third were classified as "fail-
ures" (Greenberg et al., 2007).
An analysis by the Joint Commission for Hospital
Accreditation showed that 70% of 2,455 accidents in health
care were caused by defective and faulty communication
within a team (Leonard et al., 2004). Medical errors are pre-
dominantly the consequence of a system failure and cannot
be reduced to an individual mistake. The majority of errors
are made in high-risk environments such as the trauma set-
ting (Courtenay et al., 2013). In the past, patient risks were
attributed to the extent of the disease, comorbidities, and the
difficulty of the procedure, with negligible focus on the role
of caregivers. In the past decade, this viewpoint has changed.
With the growing importance of patient safety, the influence
of the health care provider on health outcomes is empha-
sized. Experts argue that the quality of communication
between health care providers and the environment deter-
mines medical errors (Greenberg et al., 2007). Indeed, "these
errors have the potential to cause severe injury or unexpected
patient death" (O'Daniel & Rosenstein, 2008, p. 272). In
addition, communication problems have an economic impact
and may result in decreased access to care (Brock et al.,
2013; Leonard et al., 2004; Thorsteinson, 2003).
Communication and Communication Satisfaction
In non­health care settings, communication has been studied
as a contributor to job satisfaction and job performance
(Pincus, 1986). By performing a factor analysis, Downs and
Hazen (Wagner et al., 2015) identified eight dimensions of
"communication satisfaction": (a) communication climate
(general satisfaction with the communication environment),
(b) supervisor communication, (c) media quality, (d) hori-
zontal communication, (e) organizational integration (infor-
mation relevant to performing job), (f) personal feedback, (g)
organizational perspective (information about organization
as a whole), and (h) subordinate communication (for super-
visors only). Their "Communication Satisfaction
Questionnaire" is based on these dimensions. Two studies
(Kaddourah, Khalidi, Abu-Shaheen, & Al-Tannir, 2013;
Vermeir et al. 5
Pincus, 1986) identified the first, second, and sixth dimen-
sion as the strongest predictors of job satisfaction. The other
dimensions were also associated with job satisfaction. Only
the second and sixth dimensions were associated with job
performance (Pincus, 1986).
This positive association between communication satis-
faction and job satisfaction has been demonstrated among
nurses as well (Manojlovich & Antonakos, 2008; Mokoka,
Ehlers, & Oosthuizen, 2011; Probst, Baek, & Laditka, 2010;
Squires et al., 2015). Communication satisfaction with one's
supervisor has been shown to be associated with greater
organizational commitment (Moideenkutty, Blau, Kumar, &
Nalakath, 2001; Probst et al., 2010), which in turn is related
to the prevention nursing turnover (Blegen, 1993).
Job Satisfaction, Intention to Leave, and Burnout
It is clear that communication affects job satisfaction and
that job satisfaction affects nurses' turnover. Low job satis-
faction can lead to a high turnover, which negatively influ-
ences quality of care. Moreover, this causes extra recruitment
and training costs for the organization (Probst et al., 2010).
Furthermore, patient satisfaction is also influenced by nurses'
job satisfaction. Specifically, high job satisfaction is associ-
ated with higher motivation, which in turn is associated with
higher patient satisfaction about received care (Tzeng, 2002).
According to Maslow's needs theory, job satisfaction can
be defined as a form of need fulfillment, as "the match of
personal needs to the perceived potential of the job for satis-
fying those needs" or to the perception of rewards associated
with the job. In contrast, Herzberg and Mausner's motiva-
tion­hygiene theory rather defines it as "a function of satis-
faction with the various elements of the job." The presence
of motivating factors lead to motivated and satisfied employ-
ees, whereas hygiene factors do not lead to satisfaction but
their absence leads to dissatisfaction (Herzberg & Mausner,
1959). Hygiene factors such as indirect working environ-
ment (a hospital's policies, benefits, leisure activities), sal-
ary, and promotion were found to be very important but
strongly dissatisfying (Tzeng, 2002). However, each person
experiences job satisfaction differently. This is highly depen-
dent on intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. Concrete examples
of intrinsic factors are receiving recognition for one's work,
responsibility, ability to make decisions, challenges, perfor-
mances, and self-actualization. Extrinsic factors include the
behavior of executives, wages, organizational culture, work-
ing conditions (including sufficient time to perform tasks),
and safety in the workplace (Herzberg & Mausner, 1959).
The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic factors is,
however, not absolute. Leadership style, for example, is seen
as an extrinsic factor but influences job satisfaction addition-
ally through its effect on empowerment (intrinsic; Morrison,
Jones, & Fuller, 1997). In the theory of Spector, lastly, the
focus is on the cognitive process: "the affective orientation
of an employee towards his job." This can be seen as a global
feeling, or rather as a related configuration of attitudes about
different features of the job (e.g., appreciation, job condi-
tions, pay, security, personal growth and communication;
Aiken et al., 2012; Spector, 1997).
Among nurses, intrinsic factors are especially important
(Probst et al., 2010). Nurses get their motivation from pro-
tecting the patients' lives and helping them to stay or to
become healthy (Kudo et al., 2010).Areview of the literature
on job satisfaction among nurses revealed that interaction
(with patients, colleagues and managers) is another impor-
tant source of job satisfaction (Lu, While, & Barriball, 2005).
Adams and Bond observed that although nurses want auton-
omy, they also require the support of good interpersonal rela-
tionships (Adams & Bond, 2000). Some studies focused on
the importance of a good interaction with the management .
Probst et al. (2010) observed that job satisfaction increases
when supervisors communicate clearly, provide clear instruc-
tions, and show appreciation for the nurses' work. Others
highlight the importance of good coworker relationships
(Price, 2002; Tovey & Adams, 1999). A meta-analysis of
quantitative studies of nurses' job satisfaction dating from
1993 revealed, however, only moderate correlations between
job satisfaction and communication with supervisors and
peers (Blegen, 1993). Thirteen variables were frequently
examined with relation to job satisfaction. Four of these were
personal attributes or personality traits, for example, age,
education, years of experience, and locus of control. The
other nine were organizational features or job attitudes:
stress, commitment, supervisor communication, autonomy,
recognition, routinization, peer communication, fairness,
and professionalism. The variables exhibiting the strongest
relationship with job satisfaction (correlation coefficients in
parenthesis) were stress (.61) and commitment (.53). The
following five variables were moderately related to job satis-
faction. These were communication with supervisor (.45),
autonomy (.42), recognition (.42), routinization (.41), and
communication with peers (.36). Variables with small to
moderate relationships were fairness (.30) and locus of con-
trol (.28). Age (.13), years of experience (.09), education
(.07), and professionalism (.06) displayed limited correla-
tions with job satisfaction.
A more recent cross-sectional study confirms that a high
workload (due to low staffing) is related to stress, which in
turn negatively related to job satisfaction (Kaddourah et al.,
2013). In this study, almost 50% of nurses were over-
worked, dissatisfied with their income, and experienced
limited autonomy as well as poor communication with
superiors. In another study, seven factors related to nurses'
job satisfaction were identified: the ability to specialize in
one's work, safety at work, relations with supervisors,
work­life balance, relationships with other nurses, commu-
nication, and wages (Yin & Yang, 2002). Overall, this sug-
gests that there is a need for hospitals and government
authorities to strive to implement strategies that alleviate
workload and empower nurses to control their practice. The
6 SAGE Open
formulation of such strategies requires insights into the
mechanisms of job (dis)satisfaction.
The "met expectations theory" is often used to describe
job (dis)satisfaction. This theory states that individuals have
certain expectations of a job. When these expectations are
not met, individuals experience dissatisfaction (Best &
Thurston, 2004). However, this theory does not incorporate
the possible outcomes of job dissatisfaction, such as staff
turnover and turnover intention. Hence, a conceptual model
explaining the relationships between job dissatisfaction and
staff turnover is useful (Castle, Engberg, Anderson, & Men,
2007, Figure 3).
According to this model, turnover intention is influenced
by personal characteristics (age and gender), role-related
characteristics, facility characteristics (staff level), and
opportunities to change jobs. These four factors can influ-
ence job characteristics and intent to leave. The turnover
intention consists of three phases: thinking about leaving,
thinking about looking for another job, and actually looking
for another job. In each phase, the turnover intention
increases. In reality, nurses first experience job dissatisfac-
tion and then proceed to these three phases (Castle et al.,
2007; Gauci Borda & Norman, 1997; Yin & Yang, 2002).
Several studies measured the impact of job satisfaction on
intention to leave and burnout. Cavanagh and Coffin have
found that job satisfaction and job participation are crucial
variables in the turnover process, and job satisfaction was
correlated with intent to stay (r = .34, p < .05; B. Hayes,
Bonner, & Pryor, 2010). A later study found an even higher
correlation coefficient (r = .48, p < .005) between the two
measures (Gauci Borda & Norman, 1997). A meta-analysis
in 2002 (Yin & Yang, 2002) identified job dissatisfaction as
one of the strongest factors related to nurse turnover. Two
more recent studies confirm this (Castle et al., 2007; Kudo
et al., 2010). Unsatisfied nurses reported to be strongly com-
mitted to the quality of care, which may be hampered by the
experience of high workload (Castle et al., 2007; Sellgren,
Kajermo, Ekvall, & Tomson, 2009). Kudo et al. found that
the relationship with supervisors is a crucial factor in job
turnover. In addition, older nurses were less likely to leave
the organization because they have acquired more responsi-
bility, more involvement, and more competencies to cope
with problems (Kudo et al., 2010).
Job dissatisfaction is also associated with burnout among
health care staff (McHugh, Kutney-Lee, Cimiotti, Sloane, &
Aiken, 2011; Piko, 2006). Burnout is "a state of fatigue or
frustration brought about by devotion to a cause, way of life,
or relationship that failed to produce the expected reward"
(Freudenberger & Richelson, 1980, p. 13) . Job dissatisfac-
tion has been found to be associated with each of the three
dimensions of burnout, namely, emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment
(Dolan, 1987; McHugh et al., 2011).
In 2012, an international study on patient safety, satisfac-
tion, and quality of care (Aiken et al., 2012), including
61,168 nurses, from the United States and Europe, showed
high levels of job dissatisfaction, turnover intention, and
burnout. High rates of nurse burnout were found (ranging
from 10% in the Netherlands to 78% in Greece), job dissatis-
faction (ranging from 11% in the Netherlands to 56% in
Greece), and intention to leave (ranging from 14% in the
United States to 49% in Finland and Greece).Among Belgian
nurses in this sample, one quarter (730/2,938) reported feel-
ing burned out, 22% (630/3,159) were dissatisfied with their

job (ranking fifth on both parameters within the 13 European
countries in this report). Even more nurses, 30% (934/3,164),
intended to leave their job in the next year.
Recommendations for Improvement of
Communication and Communication Satisfaction
as a Prerequisite for Increased Job Satisfaction
To prevent these negative outcomes described, interprofes-
sional education, which focuses on helping teams to com-
municate in appropriate and effective ways, is needed (Brock
et al., 2013; B. Hayes et al., 2010; Leonard et al., 2004;
Mrayyan, 2006).
"Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and
Patient Safety," abbreviated as TeamSTEPPS, is an interpro-
fessional communication training model widely used within
health teams. This model was developed on the basis of
empirical evidence and is the result of a collaboration
between the U.S. Department of Defence (as part of their
patient safety program) and the agency for health care,
research, and quality. The TeamSTEPPS program consists of
three phases. The first step consists of an assessment of the
communication needs. Second, training and exercises are
performed in a controlled and simulated environment. In the
final phase, the training program is implemented and main-
tained in the work situation (Coburn & Gage-Croll, 2011,
Figure 4).
Through this program, the competencies of leadership, sit-
uation monitoring, mutual support, and communication can be
acquired. The training aims to increase mutual respect within
a team and to improve the ability to act safely, regardless of the
function or role within the team (Coburn & Gage-Croll, 2011).
The effectiveness of this method was evaluated in 306 fourth-
year medical, third-year nursing, second-year pharmacy, and
second-year physician assistant students with 149 students
completing a 4-hr training with pre- and postintervention
assessments. Positive attitudinal and knowledge effects were
seen among these students: significant improvements were
found for attitudes toward team communication (p < .001),
motivation (p < .001), advocating for patients (p < .001), util-
ity of training (p < .001), and self-efficacy (p = .005). Important
attitudinal shifts for TeamSTEPPS skills comprised team
structure (p = .002), situation monitoring (p < .001), mutual
support (p = .003), and communication (p = .002; Brock et al.,
2013; Coburn & Gage-Croll, 2011). TeamSTEPPS has been
successfully adapted and implemented to improve patient
safety through team training. On one hand, team training
increases communication and reduces error; on the other hand,
building a patient safety infrastructure supports teamwork
(Coburn & Gage-Croll, 2011).
The errors committed by one or more team members need
to be discussed openly and minimization needs to be avoided.
This is not always guaranteed. Nevertheless, within the
health care culture, the emphasis lies on quality of care and
delivery of flawless performance. Learning from errors
should become more embedded in health care delivery. If
errors cannot be openly discussed, individuals experience
stress and fatigue, resulting in impaired memory and a lim-
ited ability to multitask (Blegen, 1993).
According to Greenberg et al., three interventions exist to
reduce communication errors (Greenberg et al., 2007). The
first is described as "a set of triggers" (Table 1). When a trig-
ger from this list occurs, a nurse, or other team member
involved in the care of the patient, is required to communi-
cate the event with their colleagues. A second method is the
use of a "read-back." This is the repetition of a previously
written message, used for confirmation. Finally, protocols
for shift handover and transfers are seen as a means to reduce
communication deficits.
Leonard et al. consider the SBAR structure as a solution
for such communication problems (Leonard et al., 2004).
SBAR stands for situation, background, assessment, and rec-
ommendation. "Situation" examines what happens to the
patient, "background" investigates the clinical background
of the patient, "assessment" analyzes the problem, and "rec-
ommendation" determines how the team could resolve the
situation. By combining these four descriptions, a short and
clear overview of the situation is given, and another care-
giver can respond quickly. Leonard et al. (2004) also stress
the importance of debriefing to avoid miscommunication
and to increase patient safety. Following a procedure or at the
end of the day, a brief discussion is held on what the team did
well, what challenges arose, and what should be handled in a
different manner in the future. A debriefing provides an
opportunity to learn, for both the individual and the team.

Discussion
Job satisfaction is a complex and subjective phenomenon, as
evidenced by the numerous determinants discussed in this
article. Hence, an organization cannot expect to achieve a
significant impact with a single targeted intervention, which
is not embedded in a multilevel strategy. Our recommenda-
tions on interventions and strategies are formulated in
"Relevance for Clinical Practice."
This article presents a comprehensive review of the litera-
ture on job satisfaction in relation to communication among
nurses and provides a multidimensional overview of this
contemporary topic. During the literature search across a
number of databases, a vast amount of articles were screened.
A limitation of this review is that it has not taken cultural and
social contextual factors into account, which may also influ-
ence job satisfaction.
Several recommendations can be drawn from the present
literature review:
·
· Underline the importance of the psychosocial work
environment and the relationship between burnout,
role conflict, job satisfaction, and psychosomatic
health (problems) in health care staff (Piko, 2006).
·
· Acknowledge that improvements in this field should
be a priority and that the implementation of interven-
tions, which focuses on the intrinsic values of nurses
can help to prevent job burnout, increase job satis-
faction, and reduce turnover. Information on the psy-
chosocial work climate is necessary to provide a
basis for such interventions. From a practical per-
spective, these issues are central to changes in man-
agement practices, which should be integrated in
continuous reform.
·
· Acknowledge that "cultural change is at the heart of
this quest" (Leonard et al., 2004). Care should be trans-
formed from the culture of the individual expert physi-
cian to a truly collaborative team environment (Leonard
et al., 2004). Currently, different communication styles
of physicians, nurses, and others hamper this aim. The
complexity of the care system necessitates a change
toward a culture of open communication and collabora-
tion. Such change is essential for safeguarding clinical
outcomes.
·
· Create and maintain a work environment in which
participative management thrives. This can be
achieved by increasing psychological empowerment,
while reaffirming and strengthening the role as well as
the skills of nurse leaders. Spur team development
activities ensuring that team members value "the
importance of shared responsibility, communication,
and collective decision-making, and have a good
understanding of their respective roles" (Courtenay
et al., 2013, p. 9).
·
· Strive to improve work motivation by creating proper
work environments that enhance autonomy and enable
nurses to work as specialists. Work motivation can be
increased by showing appreciation for work per-
formed well. It is crucial that appreciation is expressed
by both the general management as well as the direct
leadership of nurse managers, who play a crucial
intermediary role at the ward level.
·
· Implement simulation training of interprofessional
teams as a first step in establishing improved commu-
nication skills within practicing clinical teams.
·
· Embed standardized tools and behaviors into the care
process, such as the SBAR method, to improve safety.
The value of such communication techniques has
already been demonstrated in other high-reliability
industries, and they present a valuable resource that
can be adapted to present-day medicine.
·
· Give particular attention to situations that are espe-
cially vulnerable for or prone to communication
breakdown, such as handoffs and transfers in care.
These can be dealt with through trigger- or checklist-
structured protocolized approaches.
Table 1. Proposed Triggers Prompting Communication With the Attending Surgeon Currently Responsible for the Patient.
Change in location of patient
Patient visit to the emergency department
Serious event Staff concern
Admission or discharge from the
hospital
Unplanned intubation or ventilator support Concern by a trainee that a situation is more
complicated than he can manage
Transfer into or out of the ICU Cardiac arrest, new arrhythmia, or hemodynamic
instability
Request by nursing or another physician or family
member that attending surgeon be contacted
 Development of substantial neurological changes 
 Development of major wound complications 
 Unplanned blood transfusion 
 Medication or treatment errors requiring clinical
intervention

 Invasive procedure or operation (by any service)

·
· Aim to identify the factors involved within the par-
ticular organization and explore their relation with job
satisfaction to aid the development of management
interventions.
·
· It is imperative that hospital management acknowl-
edge the relevance of enhancing job and communica-
tion satisfaction to clinical practice and organizational
integrity. Half of the nurses reported being over-
worked and exhibited a risk profile for burnout and
mistakes, in turn compromising patient safety
(Kaddourah et al., 2013). Management must provide
positive leadership and pay attention to the particular
factors that affect nurses to enhance nurse retention,
reduce intention to leave, and avoid nurse shortage.
In conclusion, this narrative review explored determinants of
effective organizational communication and communication
satisfaction, and the extent to which communication satisfac-
tion and job satisfaction are related among nurses. Both are the
result of a complex and multifactorial interaction, involving
both internal and external factors. Job dissatisfaction is a reli-
able predictor of burnout and turnover intention. Achieving a
balance is important for enabling job satisfaction, which is
required for both organizational stability and for guaranteeing
patient safety. This can only be achieved through an organiza-
tion-wide multimodal prevention and intervention program,
which aims to optimize different modalities of interprofes-
sional communication, workload, and job satisfaction.
