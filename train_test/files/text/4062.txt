Introduction
An abundant literature based on U.S. data and developed
countries has consistently reported that family structures are
an important factor associated with youth sexual behavior
(Albrecht & Teachman, 2004; Thomson, Hanson, &
McLanahan, 1994; Thomson & McLanahan, 2012; Wu &
Thomson, 2001). In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a few studies
have also addressed the linkages between family structures
and sexual debut (Babalola, 2004; Babalola, Tambashe, &
Vondrasek, 2005; Camlin & Snow, 2008; Diop-Sidibé, 2005;
Djamba, 2003; Kumi-Kyereme,Awusabo-Asare, Biddlecom,
& Tanle, 2007; Ngom, Magadi, & Owuor, 2003; Rwenge,
2003; Tambashe & Shapiro, 1996; Thurman, Brown, Richter,
Maharaj, & Magnani, 2006). Empirically, studies in both
developed and SSA uncovered similar results: Youth who
resided with two married biological parents reported later
age at sexual initiation. The linkages between family envi-
ronment and premarital intercourse have practical policy
implications because early sexual initiation is often associ-
ated with the risks of contracting HIV/AIDS, sexually trans-
mitted infections (STIs), and unwanted pregnancies. These
risks are drastically higher in SSA compared with any other
region around the world (Clark, 2004; Mensch, Grant, &
Blanc, 2006; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/
AIDS [UNAIDS], 2011; Zaba, Pisani, Slaymaker, & Boerma,
2004).
Notwithstanding this body of research, only few studies
have included in their analyses the potential influences of
parent­child interactions (e.g., quality of parent­child rela-
tionships, parent­child communication, and parental con-
trol). Yet, scholars suggested that family processes--referred
to as parent­child interactions--may have a high explana-
tory power (Wu & Thomson, 2001). Thus, ignoring family
processes when studying the relationship between family
environment and premarital intercourse may result in mis-
leading conclusions. Furthermore, previous studies in SSA
typically relied on cross-sectional data and used theories that
are not family-centered. Obviously, findings from those
studies are informative; however, they must be interpreted
with caution, in part because the context of first sex may
have changed in the meantime. Indeed, those studies
explained past events (e.g., sexual initiation) with current
individual, familial, and community characteristics. This
article contributes to existing literature in SSA by drawing
on a family-centered theoretical perspective and family ante-
cedents to document the occurrence of premarital
intercourse. Detailed retrospective family histories available

(West Cameroon): Does Family Environment
Matter?

Abstract
This article examined the effects of family environment on the risks of premarital intercourse for male and female youth.
Previous research in sub-SaharanAfrica (SSA) on the linkages between family structures and sexual debut mainly utilized cross-
sectional data. In a sample drawn from Cameroon Family and Health Survey (N = 2,166), descriptive and multivariate results
showed that youth who resided in nuclear two-parent families, those who reported higher levels of parental monitoring and
higher quality of parent­child relationships during childhood and/or adolescence, had significantly lower rates of premarital
intercourse. Polygynous families, parent­child communication, orphanhood, and change in family structure were significantly
associated with higher rates of premarital intercourse. Programmatic implications for reproductive health interventions in
SSA are discussed.

in the Cameroon Family and Health Survey (CFHS) are used
to estimate the effects of family structures during childhood
and adolescence. Findings indicated that the effects of fam-
ily environment (including family structures and parent­
child interactions) and parental marital status varied during
childhood and adolescence. In contrast, the effects of family
instability and changes were substantial regardless of the
timing of its occurrence.
Conceptual Framework
Previous research has focused on three main explanations of
the associations between family structures and sexual initia-
tion, including early socialization, parental control/supervi-
sion during adolescence, and family instability and changes.
Each explanation explores different aspects of family influ-
ences on youth sexual behavior; however, they are not mutu-
ally exclusive. In fact, socialization may affect parental
control/supervision under certain circumstances. Likewise,
family turbulences may impair socialization processes and
parental control. We argue that those assumptions are rele-
vant in SSA but are not yet fully examined. Likewise, we
extend the literature from developed countries to account for
specific family traits in SSA. Polygyny is the most distin-
guishing characteristic of African family structures
(Kayongo-Male & Onyango, 1984); it is still prevalent
(Westoff, 2003) and a normative marital system (van de
Walle, 2006). As such, findings from studies on the relation-
ship between family environment and sexual debut that
overlooked the role of polygyny may be inconclusive.
Finally, we consider the intervening roles of parent­child
interactions to understand how family structures affect pre-
marital intercourse.
Socialization
The theory of socialization emphasizes the role of parents as
the most influential socializing agents during early child-
hood. For sociologists and child development theorists,
appropriate behaviors are the core of child socialization.
Norms and family values and parenting models are funda-
mental in this theory holding that married two-parent homes
are protective (Albrecht & Teachman, 2004; Wu & Thomson,
2001). Researchers argued that youth from unmarried par-
ents often witness their parents' dating or cohabiting rela-
tionships while learning to deal with their own romantic
relationships (Pearson, Muller, & Frisco, 2006). Hence, they
were more likely to experience early sexual initiation or
reported higher rates of sexual activity. Robust empirical
evidence is largely from developed countries (Albrecht &
Teachman, 2004; Thomson & McLanahan, 2012; Wu &
Thomson, 2001).
Few studies have documented the effects of family struc-
tures on sexual behavior while taking into account the type
(polygynous vs. monogamous) of union (Amoran, Onadeko,
& Adeniyi, 2005; Slap et al., 2003). They found that youth
from polygynous families have higher rates of early sexual
debut. Nonetheless, the extent to which socializing mecha-
nisms differ between monogamous and polygynous families
remains unclear. The effects of polygyny on youth sexual
behavior may operate through the economic deprivation of
family members. Polygynous families have greater needs
due to the larger number of people than monogamous fami-
lies and consequently have fewer material and financial
resources to support their children (Kuate Defo, 2004;
Meekers & Calvès, 1997). Economic hardship may explain
why youth from polygynous families lack basic needs such
as food, housing, or schooling fees, and therefore engage in
premarital intercourse (Amoran et al., 2005; Slap et al.,
2003). Economic deprivation that is higher among one-par-
ent families may also explain higher rates of early sexual
debut for youth raised in those families. Socialization theory
also emphasizes the negative effects of the father's absence
during childhood (East, Jackson, & O'Brien, 2006). The key
point is that role-model fathers provide help children to
develop a healthy gender identity, appropriate sex-typed
behaviors, and a positive sexual self-image (Albrecht &
Teachman, 2004). A lack of father's presence can translate
into adverse outcomes such as premarital intercourse
(Babalola, 2004; Karim, Magnani, Morgan, & Bond, 2003;
Ngom et al., 2003).
Increasingly, researchers included measures of parental
involvement in their analyses of the effects of family struc-
ture. The quality of parent­child relationships and parent­
childcommunicationarecentraltosocialization.Parent­child
relationships encompass closeness and connectedness, the
type and level of support and security that parents provide to
children (Kumi-Kyereme et al., 2007; Slap et al., 2003). The
internalization of parental values (strictness vs. permissive-
ness) about sexual attitudes and behaviors may be higher in
supportive two-parent families. Hence, youth who benefit
from those family contexts likely refrain from early sexual
initiation. Although previous research from developed coun-
tries reported mixed results, positive parent­child relation-
ships within two-parent families are often associated with
lower rates of premarital intercourse (Regnerus & Luchies,
2006).
Communication is the main channel for parents to trans-
mit knowledge and attitudes about sexuality. Good, open,
and higher levels of parent­child communication are often
associated with lower rates of premarital intercourse (Dittus
& Jaccard, 2000). In SSA, studies on the content, time, and
frequency of parent­child communication reported that par-
ents usually feel uncomfortable to talk about sex topics
(Kouinche & Tagne, 1998). Empirically, associations
between parent­child communication and premarital inter-
course in SSA are inconclusive. Some researchers found a
weak relationship (Karim et al., 2003; Kumi-Kyereme et al.,
2007) while others found no effect (Fatusi & Blum, 2008).
The tempo of discussions about sex topics has sparked much
Tsala Dimbuene and Kuate Defo 3
debate: "Should parents talk to children before or after they
have engaged in sexual activity?" One might argue that talk-
ing to children before they engaged in sexual relationships
could prevent adverse reproductive health (RH) outcomes.
This issue is not well documented in SSA. Likely, the cross-
sectional nature of the data has limited previous research to
capture the time order of parent­child communication and
sexual initiation. In this article, we consider parent­child
communication prior to sexual debut.
Social Control
According to the social control theory, the so-called "paren-
tal supervision" or "monitoring during adolescence," young
people are naturally inclined toward deviance, but bonds to
conventional society cause most individuals to refrain from
such behaviors (Crockett, Bingham, Chopak, & Vicary,
1996). Researchers argued that the probability of adoles-
cents to engage in premarital intercourse is in large part due
to the levels of parental supervision (DiClemente et al.,
2003). The underlying assumption is that youth from two-
parent families are more likely to report higher levels of
parental supervision/monitoring than neither- or one-parent
families, thus providing youth with fewer opportunities to
engaging in sexual activities (Albrecht & Teachman, 2004;
Biddlecom, Awusabo-Asare, & Bankole, 2009; Kumi-
Kyereme et al., 2007).
During adolescence, the role of a second caregiver1
(namely, the father) becomes particularly important when the
mother's authority begins to compete with extrafamilial fac-
tors, including peer influences and community opportunities.
In Western contexts, supervision is primarily a parental task;
the absence of one parent can be detrimental for youth. Where
polygyny is rife like in African cultures, parental supervision
can be challenging even for two-parent families. Indeed, par-
ents like polygynous fathers may lack time to oversee the
elevated number of children and homes. Therefore, only
mothers are the primary supervisor similar to single-parent
households in the Western context. Hence, a lack of authority
and clear rules from mothers about sexual matters can be det-
rimental for youth in polygynous and one-parent households.
Compared with Western contexts, guidance and supervision
of youth in SSA is a social and collective task in which par-
ents play the most important role (Verhoef, 2005). Finally,
African societies have different expectations for girls and
boys about sexuality. Indeed, premarital sexuality is prohib-
ited for females but it is sometimes encouraged or not sanc-
tioned for boys (Kuate Defo, 1998). Thus, the effects of
parental control likely vary by gender and age.
Family Instability and Changes
From the perspective of family instability and changes, early
sexual initiation among youth is a function of family insta-
bility and changes occurring after a divorce, remarriage, or
parental death (Albrecht & Teachman, 2004; Cavanagh &
Huston, 2006, 2008). The increasing rates of divorce in
developed countries led researchers to focus primarily on the
negative effects of marital disruption on sexual onset
(Amato, 1987). Single-parent households in SSA generally
resulted from parental death. Parental death is a strong, trau-
matic, and stressful event that was found to correlate with
negative outcomes such as school dropouts (Case, Paxson,
& Ableidinger, 2004; Gertler, Levine, & Ames, 2004) or
risky sexual behavior (Thurman et al., 2006).
Finally, some researchers conjectured that the three afore-
mentioned perspectives can be viewed as complementary
rather than competing (Wu & Thomson, 2001). For instance,
demographic events like divorce or parental death are also
associated with family instability and changes (Bicego,
Rutstein, & Johnson, 2003; Thurman et al., 2006). These
changes lead to many stressful events for parents and chil-
dren, and therefore may affect parent­child bonds. In fact,
frequent changes within family environment may decrease
the effectiveness of social control through a decrease of
numberandtypesofparentspresentinthehome.Emotionally,
psychologically, and economically, new family environ-
ments require new adaptation. Hence, they can impede
socialization processes. Social control and socialization pro-
cesses may be linked in many ways (Wu & Thomson, 2001).
Strong social networks among parents in a neighborhood
may provide youth with great opportunities for a collective
socialization. For instance, most youth in Bandjoun know
that premarital intercourse is prohibited (Kouinche & Tagne,
1998). Likewise, the quality of parent­child relationships
leads to more effective control of children because when par-
ents provide a stable and warmth environment, children
likely internalize familial values and attitudes about sexual-
ity. In Bandjoun, parent­child relationships vary depending
on parents' gender. Fathers' relationships, especially for
daughters, are mostly vertical ones, whereas mother­child
relationships are rather horizontal and characterized by com-
panionship, confidentiality, and flexibility with respect to the
acceptance or rejection of normative behaviors (Ngom et al.,
2003). In this context, fathers provide more disciplinary
environments even though mothers may exercise more effec-
tive control over children.
Hypotheses
The literature presented above leads to a number of relevant
hypotheses in SSA. Overall, young people from two-parent
monogamous families will experience premarital sexual
intercourse at a later age compared with those who resided
in other types of families. From the socialization perspec-
tive, higher quality of parent­child relationships and higher
levels of parent­child communication about sexuality topics
are expected to correlate with lower rates of premarital inter-
course. From the social control perspective, it is expected
that higher levels of parental supervision lead to a later
4 SAGE Open
sexual initiation. From the instability and change perspec-
tive, we expect that youth who experienced family changes
and/or parental death likely report premarital intercourse.
Specifically, socialization and social control hypotheses are
tested here using family antecedents at childhood and ado-
lescence, respectively. Instability and family change hypoth-
eses are tested with parental survival and an indicator of
family structure change between childhood and adolescence.
The Study Setting
Cameroon is often referred to as a miniature Africa due to its
geographic, climatic, and ethnic diversity (more than 200
ethnic groups). There are three main ethnic groups in the
country, two in the predominantly Christian southern part of
the country, and the other in the northern part. The Bamiléké
is the largest ethnic group in the country. The Bamiléké peo-
ple are a migration population which has contributed through
its highest fertility nationally to the peopling of all regions of
Cameroon from West highlands region of their origin. The
Fang-Béti is the second largest ethnic group; they live in the
forested region in the Center, South, and Eastern regions. The
Fulani are about one third of the population and live in the
Northern part of the country. They are mostly Muslims and
form a very homogeneous group in terms of religion and
lifestyles. In contrast, our study setting (Bandjoun) is cultur-
ally homogeneous because people are mainly the Bamiléké.
Previous studies reported that the Bamiléké have plenty of
rules disapproving sexual immorality, including incest, adul-
tery, and fornication (Bouwa, 2006). Polygyny is not uncom-
mon among the Bamiléké. As such, it is almost inconceivable
for a man to divorce his wife (or wives) for any motive.
Hence, the divorce rates are lower in this region compared
with national levels and trends (Kuate Defo, 1998).
Consequently, extended families appear to be the predomi-
nant pattern in Bandjoun; at the same time, nuclear families
remain under the influences of extended families.
In cultures where the rules about sexual activity are strict,
it is common that information about sexuality topics is
passed on through cultural initiation rites precluding biologi-
cal parents. In Bandjoun traditional societies, sexuality was
taught within homogeneous sex-specific groups organized to
prepare youth for household chores and parental/societal
responsibilities. Parents were not the primary source of sex-
ual education. Nowadays, the increasing urbanization in the
country brought many changes regarding initiation rites.
There is still evidence that initiation rites about sexuality do
exist in Cameroon; however, they are less common. In spite
of the changes occurring in traditional cultures, sexuality
remains a taboo topic in Bandjoun. Consequently, the
Bamiléké feel discomfort and shame when talking about
sexuality with children. Such parent­child interactions may
impede the potential for parents to act as sexual educators
and help youth to overcome negative outcomes associated
with premarital intercourse.
Data and Method
Data were drawn from a random and representative sample
of CFHS carried out in 2002 (CFHS-2002) among individu-
als aged 10 years and older in the 75 localities forming the
prefecture of Bandjoun (Kuate Defo, 2005). Each locality
used probability samples in which all households have a
nonzero chance of inclusion. When selected, all individuals
aged 10 years and more in the household were interviewed.
A total of 4,950 respondents of both sexes were interviewed
using standard questionnaires. The present study used a sub-
sample of 2,166 adolescents and young adults of both sexes,
aged 12 to 29 years.2 CFHS-2002 gathered retrospective
information on family histories at ages 6 and 12 representing
two important transitions for youth in Cameroon. The pri-
mary school starts at age 6. Age 12 represents the emerging
adolescence and the transition from elementary to high
school. Methodologically, choosing these two markers lim-
ited recall biases inherent in retrospective surveys.
Measures
DependentVariable
Timing of premarital intercourse. The validity of respon-
dents' self-reported age at first sex or the waiting time to
premarital intercourse is debatable. Previous studies reported
that measurement of age at premarital intercourse is prob-
lematic, especially for older youth (Mensch et al., 2006). A
vast literature questioned the consistency and reliability of
self-reported age at first sex in surveys from developing
countries (Hewett, Mensch, & Erulkar, 2004; Zaba et al.,
2004). For instance, age at first sex varied with interview
modes. Likewise, underreporting is widespread among girls
(Mensch et al., 2006). In SSA, the social context can under-
mine the accuracy of self-reported age at first sex: For boys,
having sex represents prestige among peers. In contrast, it is
shameful for females to be sexually active because virginity
is still valued.
In this article, age at premarital sex3 is measured by the
respondents' self-reported age at first sex with a partner of
opposite gender (recorded in years). From an event history
perspective, the occurrence of premarital intercourse at each
age is defined as a single event and the nonoccurrence of first
sexual initiation is defined as censoring in the last interval
(e.g., young people who are not sexually experienced at the
time of interview but may experience transition to sexual ini-
tiation in the future). In practice, the probability of sexual
debut in each interval of time (a year) is estimated using a
binary variable taking the values 1 if the premarital inter-
course has occurred and 0 otherwise. Respondents were
asked the questions, "Have you ever had sexual intercourse?"
If so, "How old were you when you had first sexual inter-
course?" It was also possible to determine whether first sex-
ual intercourse occurred within or before marriage using the
following additional information about age at marriage:
Tsala Dimbuene and Kuate Defo 5
"Have you ever been married?" and "How old were you
when you first got married?"
IndependentVariables
Family structure. Defining and/or measuring family struc-
ture is also a subject of debate. The resulting ambiguity in
terminology and measurement has nurtured confusions about
its effects on youth's sexual behaviors. Data about family
structure in SSA often used the variable/question "Relation-
ship to household head" collected in censuses and surveys.
This variable provides limited information to determine
parental coresidence. To overcome these shortcomings,
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program intro-
duced additional questions to capture whether the child lives
in the same household with his or her biological parents. For-
tunately, detailed information was available in CFHS-2002
about family members present in the household at each time.
Family structures here emphasize coresidence with biologi-
cal parents. This approach differs from other aspects of fam-
ily structure such as household size, number of siblings, or
the number of generations within the household. The major
rationale is that these aspects are more difficult to capture
due to recall biases. Family configurations at ages 6 and 12
may also be subject of recall problems; however, changes in
family structure are not very common in semiurban areas in
Cameroon.
A total of 10 dichotomous questions were asked to cap-
ture family structures at a given age t (ages 6 and 12) about
members of a typical African family: "With whom did you
live at [age t]?" Responses included members of nuclear
family (father, mother, brother/sister), extended family
(cousins, uncle/aunt, grandfather/grandmother), nonrelatives
(friend, playmate), and other situations (living in institution
or alone). Only a few cases felt in items such as "friend,
playmate, in institution, and alone." Therefore, they were
excluded. Six items were used to build five mutually exclu-
sive categories of family structures: nuclear one-parent,
extended one-parent, nuclear two-parent, extended two-par-
ent, and other relatives. This last category included brothers/
sisters, uncles/aunts, and grandparents. Ideally, this group
should be divided into subgroups; however, analyses with
subgroups led to statistically unstable models. For similar
reasons, one-parent families (mother-only and father-only)
were combined.
Parental marital status. Respondents were asked the fol-
lowing question: "What was the marital status of parents/
guardians at age t?" Responses included single, married
monogamous, cohabiting, married polygynous, separated,
divorced, and widowed. A new variable was created that
distinguishes young people who lived in monogamous and
polygynous families, and other (single, separated/divorced,
and widowed).
Family processes. Family processes (e.g., quality of par-
ent­child relationships, parent­child communication, and
parental control) are complex and multidimensional con-
cepts. They are important components of effective family
environment; however, the context-specific instruments to
capture parent­child interactions are lacking in SSA. Thus,
findings should be interpreted with caution. For instance,
parent­child relationships and parental control are measured
with a single item response. Although parent­child commu-
nication about sex topics was measured using five yes/no
items, a Likert-type scale could provide a wider range of val-
ues between respondents. Family processes identified as
mediators of the effects of family structures on premarital
intercourse are described below.
Quality of parent­child relationships at age t was cap-
tured through the following question: "How did you see the
quality of your relationships with your parents/guardians at
age t?" Reponses ranged from 1 = very good to 5 = difficult/
bad. They were reversely recorded in the analyses.
Parent­child communication was measured with five yes/
no questions: "Did you ever have conversations with your
parents/guardians about puberty, sexual education, STIs and
HIV/AIDS, pregnancies, and alcohols or drugs at age t?"
Items were summed; the scores ranged from 0 to 5, higher
scores indicating higher levels of parent­child communica-
tion (Cronbach's  = .86).
Parental control. This study used direct measures of paren-
tal supervision at age t, indicating whether parents were
aware of youth whereabouts: "Were your parents or guard-
ians controlling your leisure at age t?" Responses ranged
from 1 = a lot to 5 = not at all. Responses were reversed to
obtain a gradient; higher scores correspond to higher levels
of parental control.
Parental survival. The question "What was the main reason
why you weren't living with your biological parents at age
t?" measured parents' survival status. Responses included
the following: mother and father died, father died, mother
died, school, and other. This variable was coded 1 if at least
one parent deceased and 0 otherwise.
Economic deprivation is proxied with three variables.
First, "What was the lighting type that you were using in the
home at age t?" Responses were electricity, lamp, candle,
and other. This variable was coded 1 if the lighting mode
was electricity and 0 otherwise. Second, the presence of
radio/television at home, "Did you have a radio or a televi-
sion at home at age t?" coded 1 = yes and 0 = otherwise.
Third, the educational attainment of parents/guardians was
measured by the following question: "What was the educa-
tion level of your responsible at age t?" Responses were
recorded 0 = none, 1 = primary, and 2 = high school or
university. These variables represent different aspects of
socioeconomic status (SES). Hence, they are introduced
separately in the estimations.
Other variables associated with sexual onset include age
(in years), gender (male vs. female), education (years com-
pleted), and place of residence (rural vs. urban).

Method
Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
Kaplan­Meier life tables were used to determine the median
age at premarital intercourse. For multivariate analyses,
discrete-time hazard models were used because the timing of
premarital intercourse can be viewed as an age-dependent
process. Using the person-age observation (in a person-year
file) as the unit of analysis, multivariate discrete-time mod-
els with a logit transformation (Allison, 1984) were fitted to
capture the effects of key independent variables on the prob-
ability of premarital intercourse. The log odds of premarital
intercourse can be parameterized with a general formulation
as follows:
Log ( p )= 
(ti
)
+  × FS
(ti
)
+  × MS
(ti
)
+  × X
(ti
)
+  × Z,
1 ­ p
where p represents the risk of premarital intercourse at age t
given that the individual i has not yet experienced a first sex
before age t,  designs the effect of family structure (FS), 
is the effect of parental marital status (MS),  is a vector of
parameters corresponding to covariates X that mediate the
effects of family structure and parental marital status in each
hypothesis,  is a vector of parameters of other covariates Z,
and  represents the specific effect of being in a given age
interval.
The logit coefficients represent the effects that being in
the estimated variable category has on the odds of having a
premarital intercourse relative to remaining virgin. This ana-
lytic strategy is appropriate because the events occurred in
discrete time intervals, and premarital intercourse was mea-
sured in completed years. Specifically, Models 1 to 4 (Tables
2 and 3) are performed to test the socialization and social
control hypotheses, respectively. Finally, parental survival
and family changes were used to test instability and change
hypotheses (Table 4). The indicator of family change is only
included in models using variables at age 12.
Another methodological issue relies on the nature of data:
All individuals aged 10 years and above in the household
were interviewed in CFHS-2002; therefore, observations
were not independent. They are correlated because they
share the same characteristics within the household. It is
therefore necessary to account for this correlation so as to
derive unbiased estimates of standard errors, p values, and
confidence intervals. The analyses controlled for the correla-
tion of observations on youth for the same household by
using the appropriate options in STATA software (Cleves,
Gould, & Gutierrez, 2004; StataCorp, 2005). In STATA,
when the cluster option is specified, it then corrects for the
fact that youth within a household are not independent obser-
vations. This yields robust standard errors, those obtained
via the Huber­White sandwich estimator of variance.
Moreover, should there exist intrahousehold correlation, the
robust standard errors are better indicators of the
sample-to-sample variability of the parameter estimates and
therefore produce more accurate tests of the effects of the
covariates (Cleves et al., 2004).
Results
Descriptive Analysis
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics of the sample for fam-
ily structure, parental marital status, family processes, and
demographic characteristics, and the median age at first
sexual intercourse for categorical independent variables.
Overall, 35% of young people had premarital intercourse.
The median age at premarital sex is 17.7 years. These figures
do not differ significantly from the national trends.According
to the Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)-
1998 and CDHS-2004, the median age at first sex among
young adults aged 20 to 29 years old ranged between 15.9
and 18 years. Findings in Table 1 also indicate that youth
living in two-parent families at age 12 significantly reported
the oldest age at first sexual intercourse (17.8 years), and
those who resided in extended one-parent families the
youngest (16.9 years). Likewise, youth in monogamous
families reported the oldest age at premarital intercourse
(17.7 years) than those from polygynous families (17.2
years) or other homes (17.3 years). Age at premarital inter-
course does not vary as much by parental education (17.5-
17.9 years). Youth who lived in homes with a radio/
television significantly reported younger age at first sex
(17.5 vs. 18.3 years). Conversely, youth in electrified houses
marginally reported older ages at first sex (17.9 vs. 17.6
years). There were significant differences in the age at pre-
marital intercourse with respect to parental survival: Orphans
reported significantly younger age at sexual onset (17.5
years) than nonorphans (17.8 years). Change in family struc-
ture between ages 6 and 12 also shows significant differ-
ences. Youth who experienced family changes reported early
age at premarital sex compared with sedentary respondents
(16.8 vs. 17.6 years). In this sample, no gender differences
were observed about the age at premarital intercourse (17.9
for males vs. 17.6 years for females, p > 10%).
Table 1 also displays descriptive statistics of the sample.
The distribution of family structures at ages 6 and 12 indi-
cates that one-parent families were marginal. In fact, 7.4%
and 2.8% were living in nuclear one-parent and extended
one-parent families at age 6. Corresponding figures at age 12
were 8.2% and 4.4%. In contrast, most adolescents and
young adults were living in nuclear two-parent families
(41.7%) and extended two-parent families (32.2%) at age 6.
Likewise, 36.7% and 29.1% were living in nuclear two-par-
ent families and extended two-parent families at age 12.
Moreover, a significant proportion of youth resided with
other relatives at ages 6 and 12 (15.8% and 21.7%,
respectively).

Most parents/guardians were monogamous (65% and
63% at ages 6 and 12, respectively) or polygynous (27% and
28% at ages 6 and 12, respectively). Roughly 10% of youth
lived in a family environment theoretically at risk, including
households headed by never-married or single (divorced,
widowed) people. These findings provide insights into the
persistence of polygyny in many African countries. At the
national level, the recent CDHS-2004 showed that 30% of
married women were living in polygynous unions. As regard
to parental survival, the proportion of orphans increased sig-
nificantly as youth were getting older. While 6% of youth
were orphans at age 6, these figures quadrupled at age 12.
The increasing levels of AIDS prevalence in the country
probably likely explain these trends.

Turning to family processes, findings show that the levels
of quality of parent­child relationships and parental control
were higher, with averages ranging from 3.79 to 3.96 at ages
6 and 12. Although one might expect variations in terms of
the quality of parent­child relationships and parental control
as children grew, results indicated only small changes
between ages 6 and 12. Although a modest increase was
observed between ages 6 and 12, the levels of parent­child
communication were expectedly low. Demographic charac-
teristics show that the sample consisted of 57% of females,
with an average age of 17.3 years. Unlike African settings,
nearly all respondents (99.9%) were enrolled in school at
some time of their life. As a result, the average years of edu-
cation was high (M = 8.3, SD = 2.3). Urban residents repre-
sented 16.8% of the sample.
Results From the Multivariate Hazard Models
Multivariate results are structured to follow our conceptual
framework. To achieve these goals, Tables 2 and 3 present
the estimated coefficients of discrete-time logit models
using family background at ages 6 and 12 to test the social-
ization and social control hypotheses. Models 1 and 3 in
Tables 2 and 3 are the baselines for the two key independent
variables, namely, family structures and parental marital
status. These models are extended to include family pro-
cesses and control for demographic characteristics such as
gender and age cohorts. Generally speaking, if we consider
findings from Tables 2 and 3, the odds of having premarital
sex among youth aged 12 to 29 years at the time of the sur-
vey increased monotonically with the length of exposure to
premarital intercourse. Likewise, older youth (20-29 years)
were 1.45 times more likely to have premarital sex com-
pared with adolescents (12-19 years).
Socialization Hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, family
structure and processes during childhood are influential to
premarital sex. Findings are summarized in Table 2.
Although findings went in the expected direction, family
structures at age 6 showed only marginal effects on premari-
tal sex (Model 1). Compared with two-parent families, living
with other relatives during childhood increased significantly
by 36% the odds of having premarital sex. This effect
declined slightly when all other variables were introduced in
the estimations (Model 2) but remained statistically signifi-
cant at p < 5%. Of interest in this article are family processes
related to socialization, including the quality of parent­child
relationships and parent­child communication at age 6.
Youth who reported higher levels of the quality of parent­
child relationships were less likely to have premarital sex. In
fact, an increase in the quality of parent­child relationships
decreased by 30% the odds of having premarital sex. Parent­
child communication about sexuality was not associated
with the risk of premarital intercourse, in part because of the
low levels of parent­child communication observed during
childhood. The article also considered three socioeconomic
variables, including parental education and two household
assets (radio/television and electricity at home as the lighting
mode at age 6). Overall, the socioeconomic variables are sig-
nificantly associated with the risk of premarital sex. Youth
from better-educated parents were significantly 1.223 times
more likely to report premarital sex. Likely, youth from
households with a radio/television at age 6 were marginally
1.195 times more likely to report early sexual debut.
Considering other family processes, especially parental con-
trol, findings show that youth who reported higher levels of
parental control were less likely to have ever had premarital
sex. Higher levels of parental control decreased by 34% the
odds of having premarital sex.
Turning to parental marital status at age 6 (Model 3, Table
2), findings indicate youth from monogamous families at age
6 were less likely to have premarital sex (odds ratio [OR] =
0.682, p < 5%) whereas those living with other relatives
were significantly more likely to have premarital sex (OR =
1.520, p < 1%) compared with those from polygynous fami-
lies. After controlling for all other variables, these effects
remained statistically significant (Model 4). Family social-
ization processes showed similar effects than those observed
when family structure was the key independent variable.
Indeed, the quality of parent­child relationships was signifi-
cantly associated with lower rates of premarital sex (OR =
0.64, p < 5%). Having a radio/television at home at age 6
increased marginally the odds of premarital sex. Finally,
higher levels of parental control were significantly associ-
ated with lower odds of premarital sex (OR = 0.624, p < 5%).
Social Control Hypothesis. This hypothesis emphasizes the
family environment during adolescence measured by the
types and number of parents at age 12. Results are reported
in Table 3. From Model 1, findings indicate that living with
other relatives significantly increased the risks of premarital
intercourse (OR = 1.504, p < 1%). Other family structures
(nuclear one-parent and extended two-parent families) also
showed marginal effects on premarital intercourse (ORs =
1.331 and 1.224, respectively, at p < 10%). Overall, these
effects declined slightly when family processes and demo-
graphic characteristics are included (Model 2) but they
remained statistically significant.
Considering the effects of family processes in Model 2,
findings show that the quality of parent­child relationships
was significantly associated with lower rates of premarital
sex (OR = 0.723, p < 5%). Parent­child communication at
age 12 increased significantly the odds of premarital sex (OR
= 1.315, p < 5%). Two variables of household SES (e.g.,
parental education and having a radio/television at home at
age 12) increased significantly the risk of premarital sex. In
fact, youth from better-educated parents and households
having a radio/television at home at age 12 were signifi-
cantly more likely to report premarital intercourse (OR =
1.219, p < 5% and OR = 1.444, p < 5%, respectively). In

contrast, youth from homes with electricity asset reported
marginally low rates of premarital intercourse (OR = 0.852,
p < 10%). This article is also interested in the parental con-
trol as a mechanism to oversee children to limit their oppor-
tunities to initiate sexual debut. From Model 2, findings
show that parental control is significantly associated with
lower rates of premarital sex (OR = 0.841, p < 5%).
Compared with polygynous families (Model 3 in Table
3), youth from monogamous families are significantly less
likely to report premarital intercourse (OR = 0.723, p < 5%)
whereas those who resided with other relatives are signifi-
cantly more likely to initiate premarital sex (OR = 1.315, p <
5%). When all variables are included in the estimations
(Model 4), the effects diminished but showed modest media-
tion. For instance, the effects of monogamous families
declined from 0.723 to 0.651 that represents a decline of
nearly 10%. Family processes showed similar effects to
those observed in Model 2.
Instability and Change in Family Structure Hypothesis. The key
argument of this hypothesis is that the number of changes in
family structures following divorce or remarriage and parental
death can accelerate the entry into sexual initiation. Two mod-
els were performed for each independent variable (e.g., paren-
tal survival at age 6 or 12 and change in family structures).
Baseline models (results not shown) are extended to control
for family processes during childhood or adolescence.
From Model 1 in Table 4, orphanhood that occurred dur-
ing childhood is modestly associated with the odds of pre-
marital intercourse (OR = 1.264, p < 10%).Although parental
death is theoretically a stressful event for children, findings
showed that losing parents during childhood has only weak
effects on premarital intercourse. Stated differently, an early
parental death leaves enough time to youth to adapt within
the new family environment, thus limiting its deleterious
effects. Conversely, parental death during adolescence is
more influential (Model 2 in Table 4); it increased signifi-
cantly by 22% the risks of premarital intercourse (OR =
1.221, p < 5%). Finally, changes in family structures between
ages 6 and 12 significantly affect the timing of sexual initia-
tion. Youth who moved at least once are more likely to report
premarital intercourse (OR = 1.363, p < 1%). When parental
death and changes in family structures are all included in the
estimations and after controlling for other variables (Model
4), the two variables still have significant effects on the rates
of premarital intercourse (OR = 1.287, p < 5% and OR =
1.327, p < 5%, respectively).
Discussion and Conclusion
This study has examined the effects of family environment
on the timing of premarital intercourse in Bandjoun (West
Cameroon). Although the article replicated findings about
the centrality of the family environment, the primary interest
was to further our understanding on the nature of family
influences on youth sexual behavior in SSA. By using fam-
ily background prior to sexual initiation and a family-cen-
tered perspective, this article made theoretical,
methodological, and empirical contributions in African
contexts. On a theoretical point, this article suggests that
specific family configurations such as polygyny in SSA need
to be incorporated to account for cross-country differences
of the effects of family structures on sexual initiation.
Methodologically, not only did the article use appropriate
methods to highlight the effects of family environment but
also evidenced how prior family experiences affect the tim-
ing of premarital intercourse and how these effects are par-
tially explained by the levels of parent­child interactions.
Specifically, the article revealed the changing nature and
strength of the effects of family environment early in life on
subsequent sexual behavior.
From a socialization viewpoint, researchers argued that,
under normal circumstances, nuclear two-parent families
during childhood provide warmth, strong emotional and psy-
chological support (Pearson et al., 2006), which thereafter
leads to positive sociopsychological adjustment and appro-
priate sexual behaviors. Findings indicated marginal effects
of childhood family structures. Instead, we found strong and
significant protective effects of the quality of parent­child
relationships. Because parent­child relationships are youth
self-reported perceptions, data collected from parents and
youth may be more useful for policy makers and practitio-
ners working on RH interventions.
Parent­child communication, another key factor for early
socialization, was not associated with premarital intercourse
during childhood. This result is not fortuitous; descriptive

at ages 6 and 12 are used as key independent variables, respectively.
Hence, family characteristics at ages 6 and 12 are controlled for, respec-
tively. In Model 3, change in family structure (referred to as whether the
family structure changed between ages 6 and 12) is the key independent
variable. In Model 4, both parental survival at age 12 and change in family
structure are utilized as key independent variables, controlling for family
characteristics at age 12.

results showed low levels of parent­child communication.
Possibly parents predicate that children are not ready to learn
about sexuality. Although youth identified family members
as an important source of information about sexuality
(Meekers & Ahmed, 2000), parents usually adopt fear tactics
and warning messages about sexuality when talking to youth.
Such messages inadequately explain why and how youth can
manage sexual matters and sex-related adverse outcomes.
Because studies on the protective effects of family envi-
ronment in SSA are still rare, no definitive conclusions are
drawn here. Rather these findings can serve as the bench-
mark for more in-depth research on family influences.
Indeed, families per se are not protective or at risk. Greeff
and Van Der Merwe (2004) identified additional criteria,
which are not included in this study, to ensure family protec-
tiveness (e.g., family cohesion, parental commitment, adapt-
ability, communication, spirituality, connectedness, time
together, and efficacy).
Another intriguing finding was the positive effects of
household socioeconomic assets. Studies from developed
countries revealed the benefit of better-off homes. In con-
trast, findings in SSA are mixed. Studies have reported a
negative link between household wealth and sexual onset
(Madise, Zulu, & Ciera, 2007) while others have found a
positive relationship between SES and HIV prevalence in
SSA(Djamba, 2003; Msisha, Kapiga, Earls, & Subramanian,
2008). With regard to household SES, Djamba (2003) pos-
ited that girls from wealthier families likely receive lesser
paternal attention. Men with more economic resources tend
to invest searching for more female sexual mates while
devoting less time to children.
We suggest another explanation derived from youth social
status and popularity. Higher parental SES provides youth
with higher social status and popularity among peers: they
are well dressed, have more pocket money, and therefore
they are more attractive. As a result, they have more oppor-
tunities for dating compared with their counterparts from
disadvantaged households. Because dating is generally
accompanied with gifts and parties, ceteris paribus, youth
from advantaged households are more likely to have money,
to attend parties, and to make gifts. Taken together, this may
increase their risks of premarital intercourse. Likewise, girls
from wealthier families can face more sexual pressure. In the
context of poverty, family SES becomes an important selec-
tion criterion because male youth expect gifts from females
residing in advantaged households. Conversely, female
youth from poor households are in needs and have nothing to
share. Therefore, at the same levels of beauty/attractiveness,
female and male youth from wealthier families are favored.
Monogamous families were associated with lower rates
of sexual onset. A plausible explanation is that polygynous
families provide less appropriate environments for a positive
youth development that likely increases the risks of premari-
tal intercourse. Data about family conflicts were not col-
lected in this survey; however, previous research pointed to
conflicts in polygynous families (Elbedour, Bart, & Hektner,
2007). To augment our understanding of the effects of polyg-
yny, we performed an ANOVA (results not shown). Youth
from polygynous families significantly reported lower levels
of quality of parent­child relationships and parent­child
communication. Our findings are better conceptualized with
the quality of parent­child relationships. Poor quality of par-
ent­child relationships partly explains the higher rates of
premarital intercourse in polygynous families.
From a social control viewpoint, two main conclusions
are drawn. First, youth from two-parent families signifi-
cantly reported later age at premarital intercourse. These
findings are in line with previous research from developed
(Albrecht & Teachman, 2004; Wu & Thomson, 2001) and
developing countries (Ngom et al., 2003). Second, youth
who resided in monogamous families at age 12 reported later
age at premarital intercourse. In contrast, youth who lived
with other relatives were at higher risks of premarital inter-
course. These findings stress the importance of biological
parents regardless of the type of parental marital status.
Parental control is considered the main mechanism medi-
ating the effect of family structure on premarital intercourse.
On average, higher levels of parental control were signifi-
cantly associated with lower risks of premarital intercourse,
in line with previous research (DiClemente et al., 2003;
Kumi-Kyereme et al., 2007). To understand the extent to
which parental control varies across family structures,
ANOVA was performed (results not shown). The levels of
parental control were higher in monogamous families.
Although our measures of parental control have some limita-
tions and require more refinements, this article pointed to the
importance of equipping parents/guardians with appropriate
parenting styles and strategies to improve parental guidance
and control during adolescence.
From a family instability and change viewpoint, paren-
tal death and change in family structures were significantly
associated with premarital intercourse. We argue that par-
ent-like figures care about youth after parental death; how-
ever, they cannot equally provide them with affection and
psychological support as biological parents do. The links
between orphanhood and premarital intercourse are proba-
bly more complex. The economic and physical vulnerabil-
ity parental death brought may hasten sexual initiation
among orphans. Finally, the positive effect of family
changes may be interpreted with changes in family pro-
cesses. Youth who experienced changes in family struc-
tures between ages 6 and 12 were likely exposed to different
parenting styles that can influence early sexual debut. To
test this conjecture, family processes were regressed on
"changes in family structure": Youth who experienced fam-
ily changes significantly reported low-quality levels of
parent­child relationships and parental control. Therefore,
the modifications of family processes subsequent to
changes in family structures explain the significant effects
on premarital intercourse.

Programmatically, family environment--defined as fam-
ily configurations and parent­child interactions--is an
important factor that should not be ignored in activities tar-
geted at youth in SSA to delay sexual initiation and its
adverse consequences, such as unwanted pregnancies and
STIs (World Health Organization [WHO], 2007). Lessons
learned from the past suggest that RH interventions carried
out in SSA have inefficiently affected youth sexual behavior.
Indeed, they have neglected or poorly integrated family
environment in their design and implementation. Policy
makers and practitioners in RH need to work cooperatively
with parents and other adults in the home and community,
irrespective of family structures, to enhance the quality of
parent­child interactions that mediate the influences of fam-
ily structures on RH outcomes.

Notes
1. In many societies and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) settings as
well, mothers are often the first caregiver of the children. The
changes that occurred in developed countries did not drasti-
cally change the situation. Mothers still are the first caregiver
even though fathers are more and more involved in household
life (e.g., chores, and child development and socialization). The
increasing share of female labor force participation explains at
least partly these changes: It substantially modified the division
of labor in the household, at the same, increased the fathers'
involvement in the child socialization. In African societies, the
role of fathers still is that of household's breadwinner. In this
case, mothers are often abandoned to care and fulfill house-
hold's chores and child socialization. Therefore, the protective
effect of two-parent in SSA may be very questionable.
2. One might question the definition of youth utilized in this
article. Blum (2007) provided the reasons why defining the
youth's life span should be contextualized. In the setting
under study, young people remain under the control of other
adults until marriage. In addition, including adolescents (12-
19 years) and young adults (20-29 years) is justified because
family structures at ages 6 and 12 still relevant for all youth,
even those currently married.
3. To determine whether first sex occurred before or within mar-
riage (for youth currently married), we used available infor-
mation about (a) age at first sex (in years) and (b) age at first
marriage. If first sex occurred within marriage for those cur-
rently married, they were treated as censored and were coded
0, which means that those individuals did not experience "pre-
marital sexual activity." In other words, the act of marriage
removes individuals from the risk of premarital sex, and thus
they were censored and stopped to contributing person-years
once they marry, assuming they had not yet had sex.
