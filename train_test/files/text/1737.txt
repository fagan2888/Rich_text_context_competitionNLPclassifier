Purpose: The study's goals were to understand what
changes in management practices would most improve
the jobs of frontline workers from the perspective of
workers themselves and to analyze differences across
settings. Design and Methods: The baseline survey of
direct care workers (N ¼ 3,468) conducted as part of
the National Study of the Better Jobs Better Care
demonstration asked the following: ``What is the single
most important thing your employer could do to improve
your job as a direct care worker?'' We coded the open-
ended responses and grouped them into categories.
We then compared the percentages of workers recom-
mending changes in these categories across settings
and interpreted them in the context of previous
conceptual frameworks. Results: Across settings,
workers called for more pay and better work relation-
ships including communication; supervision; and being
appreciated, listened to, and treated with respect. The
fraction of workers calling for these changes and
additional specific changes differed substantially across
nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and home
care agencies. Implications: To increase retention of
frontline workers, policy makers should design public
policies and management practices to increase pay and
to improve work relationships. However, specific
strategies should differ across settings.
Key Words: Workforce, Long-term care,
Skilled nursing facility, Assisted living facility,
Home care, Culture change.
The long-term care industry has difficulty recruiting
and retaining direct care workers--the certified nursing
assistants, home health aides, and personal care work-
ers who provide the bulk of long-term care. With the
impending growth in demand for these workers as the
population ages, this difficulty is expected to increase.
The U.S. Department of Labor projects that by 2012,
the number of home health aide jobs will increase by
48% and the number of nursing aide, orderly, and
attendant jobs will increase by 24%, putting these
among the occupations with the largest job growth
(Hecker, 2004).
Many believe that better management practices, im-
plemented as part of a broader organizational ``culture
change,'' can improve the quality of the jobs, reduce
turnover, and ultimately improve the quality of care pro-
vided (Stone, Dawson, & Harahan, 2003). Yet among
the many options that exist, researchers do not know
what changes would improve direct care workers' jobs.
We approached this question by analyzing direct
care workers' own statements about what would im-
prove their jobs and assessing the implications for
management practice and public policy. Specifically,
we address two questions: (a) What do direct care
workers say is the most important thing that employers
could do to improve their jobs? and (b) Do workers'
recommendations vary across nursing facilities, assisted
living facilities, and home care agencies?
Background
Direct care workers provide the bulk of long-term
care. Despite their importance, they often provide care
under stressful working conditions, do not have
opportunities for career advancement, and are among

the lowest paid workers (Stone & Weiner, 2001). Given
the nature of direct care jobs, it is not surprising that
long-term care providers have difficulty recruiting and
retaining direct care workers. High turnover can be
costly to consumers (Dawson & Surpin, 2001), workers
(Mickus, Luz, & Hogan, 2004), and providers (Seavey,
2004). High turnover also may lead to disruptions in
continuity of care for residents and clients (Dawson &
Surpin, 2001) and poor quality of care (Castle &
Engberg, 2005).
A number of recent workforce initiatives have
sought to improve the jobs of direct care workers in
long-term care (Harris-Kojetin, Lipson, Fielding,
Kiefer, & Stone, 2004; Stone et al., 2003). One of these
initiatives was the Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC)
demonstration (BJBC, 2002). It was designed to test
innovative policies and management practices intended
to improve the quality of direct care jobs and improve
recruitment and retention of direct care workers.
In response to a competitive request for proposals,
the demonstration selected nonprofit agencies leading
coalitions of stakeholders in five states--Iowa, North
Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Vermont--to
participate in a 3-year demonstration of a variety of
policy initiatives and management practice interven-
tions. The five BJBC projects selected provider
organizations (including nursing facilities, assisted
living facilities, home care agencies, and adult day
service providers) to implement changes in manage-
ment practices designed to improve direct care workers'
jobs. (For additional background on the demonstra-
tion, see Kemper, Brannon, Barry, Stott, & Heier, this
issue; Stone & Dawson, this issue.)
An evaluation of the demonstration analyzed the
effects of the management practice interventions on
direct care worker turnover, job satisfaction, and other
measures of job quality. Data were collected at baseline
and at follow-up at the end of the project. Data sources
included an information system that collected hiring
and termination data and surveys of clinical managers,
supervisors, and direct care workers. This article
analyzes the responses to an open-ended question in
the baseline survey of direct care workers about what
employers could do to improve their jobs.
Previous Research
Previous research includes empirical studies of direct
care workers' reports about their jobs and theoretical
frameworks developed to understand the relationship
between management practices and worker outcomes.
Direct Care Workers' Perspective
Three published studies asked direct care workers
open-ended questions about their jobs. Bowers,
Esmond, and Jacobson (2003) interviewed 41 direct
care workers in nursing facilities about what their job
was like and what led them to feel unappreciated. The
authors classified direct care workers' responses as
professional minimizing (devaluing their skill), per-
sonal minimizing (attacking their character), and
professional and personal leveling (inability to distin-
guish workers based on their skills and their characters,
respectively). Management practices identified as min-
imizing were rotation of direct care workers off of their
usual floors, use of pool staff, low wages, and poor
relationships with supervisors.
Eaton (1997) interviewed direct care workers in
depth as part of her research on the link between
quality of jobs and quality of care in nursing facilities.
Workers in low-quality nursing facilities identified lack
of recognition and respect as problems. They also felt
that their jobs entailed too little teamwork, inadequate
supplies, too much work, too many patients, and too
much paperwork.
As part of a study on supervisor relationships in
nursing facilities, McGilton, Hall, Pringle, O'Brien-
Pallas, and Krejci (2004) also interviewed direct care
workers. They identified personal and professional
factors that affected whether supervisors displayed
supportive behaviors. These factors included the
supervisor's attitude and personality, teamwork, mu-
tual support, breadth of knowledge, ability to delegate,
and willingness to share information.
Three other studies were reported in four un-
published state reports. The Nursing Home Commu-
nity Coalition of New York State (2003) used a
combination of focus groups and questionnaires to
ask direct care workers in nursing facilities what
factors contributed to poor working conditions. The
workers' most frequent responses were staff shortages,
lack of teamwork among the staff, not being treated
with respect, not having trusting relationships with
residents and families, not having the tools to do the
job, not having a good relationship with supervisors,
and not being informed of changes before they are
made. The Pennsylvania Intra-Governmental Council
on Long-Term Care (2001, 2002) conducted focus
groups with 167 direct care workers in a variety of
long-term care settings. The factors direct care workers
identified as leading to turnover included staff short-
ages, difficulty of the job, lack of appreciation by the
organization, low wages, and lack of training. Finally,
Mickus and colleagues (2004) reported on a mail survey
of 1,100 current and former direct care workers in nurs-
ing facilities and home health agencies in Michigan.
Workers at both nursing facilities and home health
agencies mentioned low pay, not feeling valued, and
personal health concerns as the top factors leading
workers to leave direct care work. In addition, nursing
facility workers were more likely to mention too many
patients, the inability to provide quality care, and
unsafe conditions, whereas home health workers were
more likely to cite not being able to work enough hours
and dissatisfaction with their work schedules.
This study extends previous research in two respects
by analyzing a large sample of direct care workers from
five states. First, to identify desired changes in manage-
ment practices, we focused on workers' assessments of
what changes employers could make to improve direct
care jobs rather than on the problems in the jobs.
Second, we extend research beyond nursing facilities by
18 The Gerontologist
comparing responses of workers in nursing facilities,
assisted living facilities, and home care agencies to
identify possible differences in desired management
practices across settings.
Theoretical Frameworks
Researchers have developed numerous management
theories to explain what factors affect employee job
satisfaction and performance (see Kreitner & Kinicki,
1998). Two of the most well known are those of
Herzberg, Mausner, and Snyderman (1959) and
Hackman and Oldham (1980). Although used widely
in research, these theories have two limitations for this
analysis: (a) They consider factors well beyond changes
management can make; and (b) they are designed to
apply across a wide range of skill levels and industries,
not specifically to long-term care. The long-term care
industry differs from many others in its dominant public
financing, vulnerable frail or cognitively impaired
``customers,'' and difficult-to-measure quality. How-
ever, Eaton (2000) and Hunter (2000) drew on existing
management and industrial relations theories to develop
frameworks specifically for nursing facilities. Both
frameworks focus on management change from the
organization's perspective rather than the worker's
perspective as this analysis does. Although Eaton and
Hunter conceptualized their frameworks quite differ-
ently, many of the specific factors they identified are
the same.
Eaton (2000) conducted 20 case studies of human
resource management practices and their relation to
quality of care. Based on the case studies, she identified
human resource practices (e.g., staffing, wages and
benefits, hiring and selection, and training) and work
organization (e.g., teams, work assignments, worker
input) as factors affecting quality of care.
Hunter (2000) analyzed the determinants of job
quality using data from a survey of Massachusetts
nursing facilities. His framework identified three
factors that define high-quality jobs: wages and
benefits, opportunities for advancement (e.g., training,
tuition reimbursement, and formal promotion pro-
grams), and new forms of work organization (e.g.,
teams and employee involvement).
A limitation of both frameworks for this study is
their specific focus on nursing facilities. Nursing
facilities, assisted living facilities, and home care
providers differ in ways that affect the nature of direct
care jobs. Understanding three fundamental differences
is necessary to interpret differences across settings in
workers' recommendations for management changes.
First, care provision in facilities differs from that in
homes. Compared with home care, in facility-based
care the facility is the center of responsibility for and
control of care, interaction with supervisors and
coworkers is frequent and in person, the work of one
affects coworkers, workers care for multiple residents,
and staffing levels affect all workers. Because home
care is provided one-on-one to specific clients in their
geographically dispersed homes, workers have greater
autonomy; scheduling regular, full-time shifts is dif-
ficult; and responsibility for scheduling and clinical
supervision can be split between two supervisors.
Second, the acuity of persons receiving care affects
the intensity of direct care staffing and supervision
needed, and the importance of clinical skills and super-
vision. Typically, the acuity of residents in nursing
facilities is greater than in assisted living. Although
resident care needs vary widely across individuals
receiving home care, acuity is typically lower than in
nursing facilities.
Finally, government payment and regulation affect
settings in different ways. Most nursing facilities rely
heavily on Medicaid reimbursements. Low Medicaid
reimbursement rates constrain the financial resources of
these facilities compared with: (a) many assisted living
facilities, which typically rely more on private pay-
ments; and (b) home care, which relies on both Medi-
care and Medicaid. Nursing facilities also are more
heavily regulated than other provider types, which can
lead to more formal organizational structures, greater
training requirements, and less flexibility to innovate.
Methods
Using the baseline survey of direct care workers in
BJBC, we coded responses to an open-ended question
about employer changes that would improve workers'
jobs and grouped these responses into categories. We
then compared the percentages of workers recommend-
ing changes in these categories across types of
providers.
Sample
The population of interest for the study was all
direct care workers at providers participating in BJBC.
A direct care worker was defined as follows:
An individual who provides hands-on personal care
(e.g., assistance with bathing, dressing, transferring
and feeding) as a significant part of their job at
a nursing facility, home health agency, assisted
living organization, adult day center or other
personal care organization. Although activities
may sometimes overlap, we do not include licensed
practical nurses or registered nurses in this defini-
tion. Also excluded are workers who help with
cleaning, meal preparation and chores, but do not
provide personal care. Typical job titles include
nurse aide, home health aide, and personal care
attendant. However, direct care workers are not
limited to these job titles (Kemper, Brannon, &
Barry, 2004, p. 1).
We identified workers from an information system
developed to provide turnover information to partici-
pating providers (Barry, Kemper, & Brannon, in press).
The information system tracks hiring, termination, and
other information about direct care workers employed
by participating providers. Upon enrollment in the
demonstration, each provider submitted a list of all
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 19
currently employed direct care workers. Each provider
updated the information system at the end of each pay
period with any changes that had occurred since the
last update.
Once a provider enrolled, surveys were sent to a list
of all of its direct care workers, which was extracted
from the information system. Because the list was of
current workers, the data do not reflect the perspectives
of workers who quit or were fired. Because providers
enrolled over time, baseline data collection extended
from July 2004 through April 2006.
A total of 3,468 direct care workers completed the
survey. Because the number of workers in adult day
service providers (n ¼ 54) was too small to analyze sep-
arately, we excluded them from the analysis, leaving a
sample of 3,414 workers in 122 providers for this anal-
ysis. Reflecting differences in the number of providers
participating in BJBC, sample sizes varied by state,
with the largest being from North Carolina (n ¼ 1,741),
followed by Pennsylvania (n ¼ 791), Oregon (n ¼ 326),
Iowa (n ¼ 324), and Vermont (n ¼ 232).
The providers included skilled nursing facilities (n ¼
53), assisted living facilities (n ¼ 33), and home care
agencies (n ¼ 36). Because the study was based on
providers that volunteered to participate in BJBC, it is
not representative of all providers. For example, three
fifths of BJBC providers were nonprofit organizations.
About a third of the home care providers were
certified home health agencies, and the other two thirds
were home care providers that typically provided
nonskilled care (sometimes in combination with skilled
care). Assisted living facilities as used here includes
a range of types of residences that generally provide
meals and personal care but not necessarily skilled care.
Han, Sirrocco, and Remsburg (2003) referred to these
as long-term care residential places. These facilities
have different names depending on the state (e.g.,
assisted living facilities, personal care homes, adult care
homes, and residential care). The BJBC providers in
this category were diverse. They included, for example,
assisted living residences that were part of continuing
care retirement communities paid for privately, and
adult care homes paid for largely through a combina-
tion of Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid.
As expected, the vast majority of direct care workers
in our sample were high school educated women (see
Table 1). Most other characteristics differed across
settings. The median hourly wage was highest in
nursing facilities ($10.34) and lowest in home care
($8.25). Health insurance benefits followed a similar
pattern: Nursing facilities had the highest proportion of
workers offered health insurance and the highest
proportion enrolled, and home care agencies had the
lowest proportions. Many workers in BJBC had long
careers in direct caregiving: The median direct care
worker in nursing facilities had spent 7.0 years as
a direct care worker and 2.8 years at their current
employer, compared with 5.7 and 2.0 years in home
care, with assisted living falling in between. More than
two fifths of the sample was older than age 45, with
home care having the oldest workers and nursing
facilities the youngest.
The overall response rate for the survey was 54%.
Response rates were higher among workers who had
worked at the provider longer, in smaller organiza-
tions, in Vermont and Oregon, and in home care
agencies and adult day service providers. To adjust for
these differences, we reweighted the respondent sample
so that the distribution of the sample matched the
population distribution on these characteristics.
Direct Care Worker Survey
The survey was an 8-page self-administered paper
booklet. It included questions about length of employ-
ment, job satisfaction, job rewards and problems,
supervision, perceptions of quality of care, job
confidence, training, intent to quit, and demographic
characteristics. Personalized packets including a survey,
informed consent, a $2 bill, and a business reply
envelope for all direct care workers were sent to the
provider for distribution. The incentive was given up
front to everyone because of evidence that it increases

response rates more than incentives paid later only to
respondents (Church, 1993; James & Bolstein, 1992).
Respondents returned the surveys in the business
reply envelopes. Responses were tracked using identi-
fication numbers on each survey. To increase response
rates, workers received a follow-up packet about
a month after the initial packets were distributed. To
ensure that the employer did not know who the
nonrespondents were, everyone from the original list
received a follow-up packet. For nonrespondents, the
follow-up mailing included another copy of the survey
and reply envelope. Those who had already responded
received a thank you letter and a copy of a BJBC
newsletter. The second administration increased the
response rate by 10 to 15 percentage points.
Coding and Analysis
We obtained direct care workers' recommendations
for improving their jobs from responses to the following
open-ended question: ``What is the single most impor-
tant thing your employer could do to improve your job
as a direct care worker?'' The advantage of open-ended
survey questions is that they allow respondents to fully
express their response, providing more in-depth in-
formation than closed-ended questions (Bradburn,
Sudman, & Wansink, 2004). Although the analysis of
recommendations obtained by asking workers directly
is a strength of this study, we should note that their
recommendations may not have recognized constraints
management faces or changes they are not familiar
with. In addition, by asking for the single most
important change, the question did not allow for the
possibility of indirect or interactive effects or give any
weight to secondary recommendations.
We reviewed the text responses to the question and
identified themes based on recurring words (or
synonyms) in the responses. For example, we identified
a communication theme based on responses such as
``better communication'' and ``keep communication
open,'' but we also included responses like ``keep us
informed of changes'' in that category (see Table 2).
We then developed written criteria for 16 categories

(including a left-blank category for nonresponse) and
assigned responses to one of those categories.
We also aggregated the detailed categories into five
major categories of related responses. Most workers
(79%) gave a response that fell into a single category.
When a respondent provided more than one recom-
mendation, we coded the first one, recognizing that this
may not have been the most important in all cases.
To assess reliability a second investigator coded the
responses independently based on the written criteria.
The second coder agreed on 90% of the detailed
categories and 94% of the aggregate categories.
We estimated the weighted mean percentage of
workers making each type of recommendation and
compared the means across the three types of providers.
When comparing settings, we tested the statistical
significance of the difference for each pair of provider
types using a t test with a Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing.
Results
Direct Care Workers' Recommendations for
Improving Their Jobs
Not all workers made a recommendation for
improving their jobs. This group had two subcatego-
ries: a smaller group whose responses indicated that
they were satisfied with their jobs, and a larger group
that did not respond to the question. Direct care
workers in home care were least likely to make
a recommendation: 37% of home care workers made
no recommendation compared with 24% in assisted
living and 20% in nursing facilities (see Table 3).
Those not making a recommendation presumably
either did not take time to respond, were happy with
their job, or were unable to identify a change that would
improve their jobs. As a group, those not making
a recommendation were more satisfied with their job
than those making a recommendation. For example, in
nursing facilities, based on responses to a separate survey
question about job satisfaction, 39% of workers who did
not make a recommendation said they were extremely
satisfied with their job compared with only 22% of those
making recommendations (data not shown).
Increased Compensation.--Many workers called
for increased compensation, including more pay, better
benefits, or the opportunity to work more hours.
Workers in home care (39%) and assisted living
facilities (36%) were much more likely to say that
increasing compensation was the single most important
thing that employers could do to improve their jobs
than workers in nursing facilities (23%). The differ-
ences were even more dramatic among workers who
made a recommendation: 63% of home care workers
identified compensation compared with 47% in assisted
living and 29% in nursing facilities (data not shown).
In all three settings, most workers who mentioned

compensation called for increased pay; much smaller
percentages identified improved fringe benefits or the
opportunity to work more hours. Consistent with their
lower percentage with employer-sponsored insurance,
home care workers stood out as more likely to call for
better fringe benefits than workers in facilities. They also
were more likely to identify being able to work more
hours as important. This reflects the difficulty of sched-
uling consistent, full-time work given turnover among
clients and the complexity of matching clients with
workers within a reasonable distance of their home.
Improved Work Relationships.--The work relation-
ship category included a range of responses grouped
into six subcategories. The language used more often
was personalized and suggested greater intensity of
personal concern in three subcategories: listening (e.g.,
``listen to what I say''), appreciation (e.g., ``care about
us''), and respect (e.g., ``treat us with respect'').
Although often not explicit, many of the responses
appeared to refer to treatment by supervisors and may
have reflected the culture of the organization. The
language used in the other three subcategories--
improved communication, better supervision, and
more teamwork--tended to be less personalized.
Work relationships appeared to be of greatest con-
cern in nursing facilities and of least concern in home
care, with assisted living in between. In all, 24% of
workers in nursing facilities mentioned work relation-
ships compared with 19% in assisted living and 11% in
home care. The high percentage in nursing facilities is
consistent with the frequent interactions with peers and
more intensive supervision in this setting. Of the six
subcategories, direct care workers in nursing and
assisted living facilities most often listed improving
supervision. The three subcategories about how work-
ers are treated (which, as indicated, at least partly reflect
supervisory behavior) also were more often mentioned
in nursing facilities: 11% of direct care workers in
nursing facilities called for appreciation, respect, or
being listened to, compared with only 7% of workers in
assisted living and 4% in home care. Although
workers in home care mentioned work relationships
least often overall, they called for improved communi-
cation more often than other aspects of work relation-
ships. This is consistent with the greater difficulty of
communicating with workers not on site.
Improved Staffing.--Workers in nursing facilities
identified hiring more or better staff more often than
any other major recommendation category and more
often than workers in any other setting. In all, 25% of
workers in nursing facilities identified staffing com-
pared with 10% of workers in assisted living and
almost none in home care. That home care workers do
not identify increased staffing is not surprising given
that their own work is largely unaffected by the
aggregate staffing in the organization. The lower
percentage in assisted living than nursing facilities
may reflect the lower acuity of assisted living residents
or the higher level of staffing relative to care needs.
Improved Management Systems.--This category
included recommendations concerning the purchase or
maintenance of equipment, the availability of training
and continuing education opportunities, the process of
setting employees' work schedules, and a variety of
miscellaneous changes in work processes. Improving
management systems was suggested by a minority of
direct care workers ranging from 8% in nursing
facilities to 12% in home care. Within the broad
category, workers in home care and assisted living
called for increased training more often than nursing
facility workers--likely due to regulatory requirements
for training in nursing facilities. Compared with
workers in facility-based settings, home care workers
recommended improved scheduling more often, reflect-
ing the greater difficulty of scheduling in home care.
Worker Recommendations in the Context
of Theoretical Frameworks
In their theoretical frameworks, Eaton (2000) and
Hunter (2000) identified many of the categories of
management changes that workers identified. Both
identified pay and benefits, worker input (which
corresponds to listening), and training. However, they
also identified changes that workers did not: organiza-
tion in teams (both), work assignments (Eaton), formal
promotion programs (Hunter), tuition reimbursement
(Hunter), and selection (although a few workers iden-
tified hiring better workers) and recruitment (Eaton).
Workers' failure to mention them is not surprising
because workers are unlikely to have experienced such
practices or, in the case of recruitment and selection,
they may not feel that this affects their own jobs.
At the same time, workers identified some changes
not identified in the two frameworks. Most important
are the many dimensions of work relationships: respect,
appreciation, listening, teamwork, communication, and
supervision. The frameworks also did not identify
working more hours (which home care workers called
for). This is not surprising given that Eaton and Hunter
developed the frameworks for nursing facilities.
Discussion
Two changes that direct care workers identified as
the single most important thing their employers could
do to improve their jobs were common across nursing
facilities, assisted living, and home care. Workers in all
three settings called for two changes: (a) more pay and
(b) improved work relationships.
It is the differences across the three settings, however,
that stand out in what workers said. For example,
although workers in all types of providers mentioned
increased pay and improved work relationships as
important, the fraction of workers doing so varied
greatly across settings. Moreover, workers in different
settings differed with respect to the specific subcategories
ofrecommendationstheyemphasized.Asaconsequence,
although some policies and management strategies for
improving jobs apply across the board, some different
ones will be needed depending on the setting.

Implications for Management
We base our discussion on averages across providers,
focusing on recommendations made most often in each
setting, under the assumption that they are most
important for managers in general. However, what is
relevant to a particular provider will differ depending
on the provider's particular circumstances. Because
what workers say generally may not apply to specific
providers, a good place for managers to start in deciding
how to improve jobs is by asking their own workers.
Our findings are also averages across workers.
Because what is most important varies across workers,
no one type of management change will improve every
direct care worker's job. Thus, improving jobs is likely
to require a multipronged strategy of management
practice changes.
Nursing Facilities.--Increasing staffing stands out
as a priority for management change in nursing
facilities--it was workers' most frequently mentioned
change. Another priority should be improving work
relationships--especially supervision and whether
workers are appreciated, listened to, and treated with
respect. Improving relationships through training in
communication, supervision, and team building; peer
mentoring; and greater involvement of direct care
workers in care management decisions are promising
management practices that were tested in BJBC.
Increasing pay appears to be the third most important
change that would improve workers' jobs.
Assisted Living Facilities.--Increasing pay stands
out as a change managers in assisted living should focus
on--a third of workers said increasing pay is the most
important change employers could make. Managers
should also take steps to improve supervision, as well
as other work relationships. Finally, providing more
training and increasing staffing are additional changes
workers identified that management should consider.
Home Care Agencies.--Because care is delivered
largely one-on-one in clients' homes, managers in home
care face quite different challenges than managers of
facility-based providers. Indeed, fewer factors that
affect workers' jobs are under management's control.
Reflecting this in part, direct care workers in home care
were least likely to identify anything that employers
could do to improve their jobs. Increasing compensa-
tion is by far the most important change that managers
can make, as identified by workers. In addition, an
important minority of home care workers called for
better fringe benefits. Managers should also respond to
home care workers' concerns about the number of
hours they work, scheduling, and more training.
Implications for Public Policy
For public policy makers, our findings have two
related implications. First, government policies that
increase direct care workers' pay are important to
improving jobs. Low Medicaid reimbursement rates are
likely to lead to low pay and high turnover, especially
in providers for whom Medicaid payments are a large
share of revenue.
Second, policies that increase pay are not the only
ones that can improve jobs. For example, government
regulatory policies that lead to improved training of
direct care workers and their supervisors have potential
for improving jobs and reducing turnover. Pay-for-
performance policies that emphasize turnover and
retention (e.g., those in Iowa and Minnesota; Kane,
Arling, Mueller, Held, & Cooke, 2007; Lipson, 2005)
or other aspects of direct care workers' job quality in
their performance criteria also may be effective.
Another policy option is to undertake initiatives for
assisted living and home care similar to the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services' Nursing Home Quality
Improvement Initiative (Kissam, et al., 2003) to offer
training opportunities for workers in these settings. In
short, multiple policy options other than increasing
workers' pay could help improve jobs and ultimately
reduce turnover.
Implications for Research
This analysis has identified the management changes
that workers say would improve their jobs. However, it
has not provided evidence of the effectiveness of these
changes in improving retention or quality of care.
Managers and policy makers need this evidence to
understand whether the management changes have
benefits beyond improving jobs. Given the importance
of work relationships to direct care workers, research
on management practices that improve work relations
also is needed. Research planned using the data gen-
erated by BJBC will analyze the effects on supervision,
turnover, and worker perceptions of quality of care of
the changes identified not only in Eaton's (2000) and
Hunter's (2000) frameworks, but also by direct care
workers themselves.
Finally, our findings have an important implication
for researchers: Do not assume that findings from
research on nursing facilities apply to other settings.
Some findings from nursing facilities, where so-called
culture change originated and where most of the
research on improving direct care workers' jobs has
been done, will apply to other types of providers, but
not all findings will. Looking only through the lens of
skilled nursing facilities may distort researchers' ability
to see what changes are needed in assisted living and
especially in home care.
