High blood pressure (BP), or hypertension, is a modifiable
risk factor for cardiovascular disease.1 Elevated BP (EBP) lev-
els increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and
kidney disease. Hypertension awareness followed by effec-
tive treatment and control measures can reduce morbidity
and mortality associated with uncontrolled hypertension.2­5
Although hypertension is more prevalent among adults than
youths, recent population-based, prospective cohort studies
have reported that BP levels measured in childhood and ado-
lescence are also associated with elevated BP in adulthood.6­9
High body mass index (BMI) has been linked to elevated BP
levels among youths and adults.10­12 In 2003­2006, 17.0% of
children aged 6­11 years old and 17.6% of children aged 12­19
had a BMI for age and gender 95th percentile.13 The preva-
lence of youth 95th percentile of BMI for age and gender in
the United States increased from 1976­1980 to 1988­1994
and further increased from 1988­1994 to 1999­2000 (ref.
14). However, the most recent report suggests that no statis-
tically significant trend in high BMI for age and gender was
found over the time periods 1999­2000, 2001­2002, 2003­
2004, and 2005­2006 ref. 13). The increasing prevalence of
childhood overweight and the associated increasing risks for
hypertension and increased carotid intima-media thickness in
adulthood have implications for intervention, screening, and
educational initiatives.6
We analyzed the data from three time periods using
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANESs) conducted in 1988­1994, 1999­2002, and 2003­
2006. Measured BP levels of survey participant's aged 8­17
years were used. The objectives of the analysis were: (i) to esti-
mate pre-EBP and EBP prevalence; (ii) to examine changes in
these estimates over time ; and (iv) to examine the association
of body mass index (BMI) with pre-EBP and EBP controlling
for age, gender, and race/ethnicity.

Background
Elevated blood pressure (EBP) in children and adolescents
increases future risk of cardiovascular disease. Among children and
adolescents, increased weight is associated with EBP.
Methods
National cross-sectional data for children and adolescents aged 8­17
years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANESs): 1988­1994, 1999­2002, and 2003­2006.The main
outcome measures were EBP and pre-EBP estimates.
Results
Overweight boys (odds ratio (OR) 1.54, confidence interval (CI)
1.11­2.13) and both obese boys and girls were significantly more
likely to be classified as pre-EBP (boys, OR 2.81, CI 2.13­3.71; girls, OR
2.55, CI 1.75­3.73) and having EBP (boys aged 8­12 years, OR 6.06, CI
2.73­13.44, boys aged 13­17, OR 9.62 CI 4.86­19.06; girls, OR 2.33,
CI 1.31­4.13) when compared to the reference weight and controlling
for all other covariates.
During 2003­2006, 13.6% (s.e. = 1.2) of boys aged 8­17 years and
5.7% (s.e. = 0.7) of the girls aged 8­17 years were classified as pre-EBP
and 2.6% (s.e. = 0.5) of the boys aged 8­17 and 3.4% (s.e. = 0.7) of
the girls aged 8­17 were having EBP. After controlling for age, race/
ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI), girls only were significantly
more likely to have EBP during 2003­2006 than during 1988­1994
(OR 2.17, CI 1.05­4.49). In contrast, adolescent boys aged 13­17 years
were significantly less likely to be having EBP during 2003­2006 than
during 1988­1994 (OR 0.32, CI 0.13­0.81).
Conclusions
Obesity is strongly, positively, and independently associated with EBP
and pre-EBP among youths. However, controlling for all covariates
including BMI, EBP has increased among girls but decreased among
adolescent boys aged 13­17, during 2003­2006 when compared
with 1988­1994.

Methods
Surveydescription. NHANES of the National Center for Health
Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides
cross-sectional, nationally representative health examina-
tion data on the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population.
A complex, multistage probability sampling design is used to
identify the eligible sample.15 The NHANES 1999­2006 sam-
ple included oversampling of youth aged 12­19 years, Mexican
Americans, and blacks. The procedures to select the sample
and conduct the interview and examination have been previ-
ously described.15,16
Sample. The NHANES III (1988­1994) sample included 6,364
children and youths aged 8­17 years of whom 4,673 (73.4%)
were interviewed and examined. The NHANES 1999­2002
included 5,998 children and youths aged 8­17 years of whom
5,110 (85.2%) were interviewed and examined. The NHANES
2003­2006 sample included of 6,630 children and youths
aged 8­17 years of whom 4,662 (70.3%) were interviewed and
examined.
Measurements. The average of up to three brachial systolic
(first Korotkoff phase) and diastolic (fifth Korotkoff phase) BP
readings were used as the participants' systolic and diastolic
BP values. In NHANES III 94% had three BP measurements;
in NHANES 1999­2002 85% had three BP measurements; and
in NHANES 2003­2006 72% had three BP measurements.
Appropriate BP cuff sizes were used for participants based on
measurement of midarm circumference.16,17 All BP readings
were obtained at a single examination visit following a stand-
ard protocol.16
We classified individual participant's BP using the new
guidelines detailed in the Fourth Report on the Diagnosis,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children
and Adolescents.18 The new guidelines recommend multiple
BP measurements at different times to define persistent hyper-
tension and prehypertension. In this study, all BP readings
were obtained at a single examination visit there was a need
to differentiate between the guidelines nomenclature for pre-
hypertension and hypertension and our nomenclature for the
same outcome of interest. Because our study design only had
access to one BP measurement per survey participant, if the
single BP measurement was in the prehypertensive BP range
it was labeled in this paper as a pre-EBP. Also, if the single BP
measurement was in the hypertensive BP range, it was labeled
in this paper as an EBP. A somewhat similar approach was
taken by Din-Dzietham et al.19
A child was classified as having pre-EBP if one of the four
following criteria was satisfied: (i) the percentile for systolic
BP 90% but <95% and the diastolic percentile <90%; (ii) the
percentile for diastolic BP 90% but <95% and the systolic BP
percentile <90%; (iii) the percentile systolic BP 90% but <95%
and diastolic BP percentile 90% but <95%; (iv) observed BP
levels 120/80mmHg even if systolic and diastolic percen-
tiles are <90%. EBP was defined as the percentile for systolic
BP and/or a percentile for diastolic BP that is 95% for gender,
age, and height. See the Fourth Report (Appendix B in report--
for further details).18 In classifying an examinee as EBP or pre-
EBP, individuals with missing diastolic values but valid systolic
values were included. Thus if an examinee' s mean systolic BP
was greater than or equal to the sex and age-specific systolic
BP threshold, the examinee was classified as pre-EBP or EBP
even if the mean diastolic BP was missing. The prevalence of
pre-EBP and EBP in youth during NHANES III, NHANES
1999­2002, and NHANES 2003­2006 were based on 4,033
(86.3% (4,033/4,673)), 4,846 (94.8% (4,846/5,110)), and 4,427
(95% (4,427/4,662)) cases, respectively, all nonpregnant.
Height in centimeters and weight in kilograms were meas-
ured in the mobile examination center following a standard
protocol. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters (kg/m2) and was catego-
rized using the age- and sex-specific BMI percentiles based
on the year 2000 growth charts of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.20,21 BMI was categorized as (i)
underweight defined as BMI less than the 5th sex-specific
percentile of BMI for age, (ii) "normal weight" defined as at
or above the sex-specific 5th percentile but less than the 85th
percentile of BMI for age, (iii) overweight defined as BMI at
85th percentile but less than 95th percentile for age, and (iv)
obese defined as BMI >95th percentile for age. (This termi-
nology reflects the labels used by the Institute of Medicine,
American Academy of Pediatrics, and other organizations.
For more information see Krebs et al.22) For this analysis, age
was categorized into two groups: 8­12 and 13­17 years, simi-
lar to previous analyses.12 Race/ethnicity was based on self-
report and categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Mexican American. Estimates for persons classi-
fied in the "other race/ethnicity" group, including persons
who reported "multiple races" and "other Hispanic" ethnicity
were included in the total sample results but are not reported
separately.
Statistical methods. Estimates of the prevalence of pre-EBP
and EBP among nonpregnant children and adolescents 8­17
years are presented for NHANES III (1988­1994), NHANES
1999­2002, and for NHANES 2003­2006 by the cross classi-
fication of race/ethnicity, gender and age, and by gender and
BMI category. Estimates are not presented by the cross clas-
sification of gender, BMI category and race/ethnicity nor are
they presented for underweight because the sample sizes for
these subdomains were too small to present statistically reli-
able results. Sample weights which account for the unequal
selection probabilities and adjust for nonresponse and non-
coverage are incorporated into the estimation procedure to
produce unbiased estimates. Standard errors of these estimates
were made using SUDAAN software to account for the com-
plex sample design. To test the association between EBP and
time period as well as pre-EBP and time period (1988­1994,
1999­2002, and 2003­2006) for all children and adolescents
and within categories defined by race/ethnicity, gender and
age group, a modified Rao­Scott test statistic for association
(Proc Survey Freq, SAS V9.1) was used. This statistic adjusts

the usual weighted Pearson 2 by a design effect and follows
the F distribution. It is more conservative than 2 Statistics.23
To test for changes in pre-EBP and EBP we used logistic
regression to model these prevalences as a function of time
period by treating time as a categorical variable and control-
ling for the possible confounding effects of gender, race ethnic-
ity, age group, and BMI category. Underweight was excluded
because of the small sample size (n = 60). Initially the models
also included all possible two-way interactions of these main
effects. Higher order interactions were not included because
the number of variables included in the model would exceed
the number of degrees of freedom. To test for significance, the
Satterthwaite adjusted F test24,25 was used. An interaction (P <
0.1) was found between sex and the NHANES survey years for
both pre-EBP and EBP. Therefore, separate models were devel-
oped for boys and girls; these models included time period,
race ethnicity, age group, and BMI category together with all
possible two-way and three-way interactions. For pre-EBP and
EBP in girls, none of the three-way or two-way interactions was
significant. For EBP in boys all of the three-way interactions
were significant. Therefore, to help interpret the information
because of the significant third-order interaction we stratified
the model into the two age categories. Age category was the
logical category to stratify by because it is the most inclusive
and interpretive category. The separate models by age group
(8­12 years and 13­17 years) initially included all the two-way
interactions; however none of those were significant. Our final
stratified models therefore included main effects only. Odds
ratios having a 95% CI not including unity were considered
statistically significant for the logistic models.
All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS 9.1 for
Windows software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN
software (RTI, Research Triangle Park, NC).
Estimates for which the relative standard error (defined as
the ratio of the standard error of the percent to the percent
times 100) exceeded 30% are presented with an asterisk beside
them. Estimates whose relative standard errors exceeded 40%
are presented with two asterisks beside them. The asterisks and
the double asterisks indicate that the estimates are unreliable
(Tables 1 and 2).
Results
Table 1 presents pre-EBP prevalence estimates from the three
survey periods. During 2003­2006, 13.6% of boys aged 8­17
years and 5.7% of the girls aged 8­17 years were classified to
have had pre-EBP. The prevalence of pre-EBP did not vary sig-
nificantly over the three time periods 1988­1994, 1999­2002,
and 2003­2006 for those aged 8­17 years old. However, sub-
sample analyses showed that there was a significant association
between pre-EBP and time period for Mexican-American girls
aged 8­12 years, and for non-Hispanic black adolescent girls
aged 13­17 years (Table 1).
Table 2 presents EBP prevalence estimates from the three
survey periods. During 2003­2006, 2.6% of the boys aged
8­17 and 3.4% of the girls aged 8­17 were considered to have
had EBP. There were no significant differences in observed
EBP prevalence estimates for the total sample among the
three survey periods. However, subsample analyses showed
a significant association between EBP and time period for
adolescent girls aged 13­17 years and for

white adolescent girls aged 13­17 years (Table 2). Finally,
Tables 1 and 2 describing pre-EBP and EBP estimates
included a number of unreliable estimates with large rela-
tive standard errors. However, in hypothesis testing, we
were concerned with the estimated difference. Therefore,
a 
statistical test was preformed, even if one or both of the
proportions were not quite "statistically reliable" because the
test statistics was still valid. Obviously, with large relative
standard errors the differences must be large to be consid-
ered 
statistically different.

Trends of EBP Among Children and Adolescents
Multivariate analyses
Tables 3 and 4 present the adjusted odds ratios by gender
(Table 3 for girls and Table 4 for boys) for the outcome
variables pre-EBP and EBP. Non-Hispanic black girls were
more likely to be classified as having pre-EBP when com-
pared with non-Hispanic white girls (odds ratio (OR) 1.53,
confidence interval (CI) 1.12­2.09). Younger children were
less likely to be classified as having pre-EBP than adoles-
cents of the same gender (boys OR 0.22 CI 0.15­0.31; girls
OR 0.55; CI 039­0.77). Overweight boys but not girls were
significantly more likely to be classified as having pre-EBP
(OR 1.54, CI 1.11­2.13) when compared to the reference
normal BMI. Obese children and adolescents were signifi-
cantly more likely to be classified as having pre-EBP (boys,
OR 2.81, CI 2.13­3.71; girls, OR 2.55, CI 1.75­3.73) and hav-
ing had EBP (boys aged 8­12 years, OR 6.06, CI 2.73­13.44,
boys aged 13­17, OR 9.62 CI 4.86­19.06; girls, OR 2.33, CI
1.31­4.13) when compared to reference normal BMI. The
adjusted models using survey period as a discrete variable,
with 1988­1994 as a reference, showed a twofold increase
in the odds of being classified as having EBP for girls dur-
ing 2003­2006 survey period when compared to 1988­1994
(OR 2.17, CI 1.05­4.49). Adolescent boys aged 13­17 years
were less likely to be classified as having EBP during the
2003­2006 survey period when compared to 1988­1994 (OR
0.32, CI 0.13­0.81), whereas for boys aged 8­12 years there
was no significant changes in the odds of being classified as

having EBP during the later time period.
Discussion
During 2003­2006, 13.6% of the boys aged 8­17 years and
5.7% of the girls aged 8­17 years were classified as having
pre-EBP and 2.6% of the boys aged 8­17 and 3.4% of the girls
aged 8­17 were classified as having EBP. Overweight boys and
obese boys and girls were significantly more likely to be clas-
sified as having pre-EBP and having EBP after controlling for
all other covariates. Trend analysis showed that girls only were
significantly more likely to be classified as having EBP during
2003­2006 than during 1988­1994. In contrast, adolescent
boys aged 13­17 years were significantly less likely to be classi-
fied as having EBP during 2003­2006 than during 1988­1994.
The prevalence of EBP in our study is consistent with
other recent reports. Hansen et al. reported hypertension
prevalence of 3.6% among a cohort of 14,187 children and
adolescents with an average age of 9.5 years (range 3­18
years) who had their BP observed at least three times during
well-child care visits.26 Our prevalence estimate of EBP for
children aged 8­12 years was 3.4% (CI 2.3­4.7%). However,
our results can only be obliquely compared to Hansen et al.
results because theirs were based on more then one visit.
Very recently, Din-Dzietham et al.19 reported BP trends in
children and adolescents using NHANES data from 1963
to 2002. Their overall prevalence estimates for EBP rates
were higher for NHANES 1988­1994 (2.7%, s.e. = 0.5) and
NHANES 1999­2002 (3.7%, s.e. = 0.4), than our estimates of
EBP for the same time period (2.1% (CI 1.3­4.1%) and 2.9%
(CI 2­4.8%), respectively).

Although, their prevalence estimates were higher than
ours, there were no statistically significant differences in the
estimates. We suggest that the discrepancy in the prevalence
between our results and Din-Dzietham's results may stem from
truncating the age in their calculations (e.g., 156 months/12
would be truncated to 13 years) and excluding from their anal-
yses youth classified as "other" for race/ethnicity category. Still
another possibility for the discrepancy, although not as salient,
may be the starting point of age calculation; we used date of
exam as an index for age and they used date of interview. Up to
six weeks may elapse from interview date to exam date. Finally,
Gender, age group, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic blacks),
height, and increased weight had been previously associated
with increased BP.11,12,19,27­29
After controlling for all other covariates including BMI
categories, survey period (2003­2006) was associated with
increased prevalence of EBP in girls. However, for adolescent
boys aged 13­17 years there was a significantly lower preva-
lence of EBP during this time period. Although the decrease
was mainly reflected among white adolescents and among
the obese (Table 2); the reason for this discrepant result in
one of the 24 (3 × 2 × 2 × 2) time period, gender, age group,
EBP, subgroups could be a chance finding or could reflect a
BP­obesity interaction among adolescent boys compared
to the other subgroups. Furthermore, this suggests that the
increase in BMI may not explain all of the factors contrib-
uting to the increase in hypertension prevalence, or possi-
bly that BMI does not capture the entire impact of increased
body fatness. Environmental factors and lifestyle behaviors
such as physical activity are associated with BP levels among
adults and may also play a role in the causal pathway for
youth.30­32
Race/ethnicity in girls, classification of overweight in boys,
and obesity in boys and girls were all independently associated
with pre-EBP. It has been suggested that pre-EBP classification
in children, as with adults, should alert the clinician of possi-
ble subsequent hypertension and a need for a closer medical

follow-up--individuals in this category may proceed to develop
hypertension and cardiovascular disease in the future.18
The major strengths of this analysis are that national data
were obtained on large samples of US children and adolescents,
including two major US population subgroups. The survey
uses rigorous quality control monitoring, a standardized BP
protocol, calibrated equipment, and well-trained examiners.
Moreover, the same data collection protocol and equipment
have been used to collect BP since 1988 (ref. 16). Although
NHANES 1999­2002 data on EBP was previously reported,
this study provides additional 4 years of data and the "other"
race/ethnicity category were not excluded from the analyses.
The limitations of this analysis include the fact that BP lev-
els were based on an average of three readings completed at
one point in time. According to the new guidelines, elevated
BP must be confirmed on repeated visits before characterizing
the child or adolescent as having prehypertension or hyper-
tension. Therefore our results may likely to overestimate EBP
status for specific individuals. Second, we did not consider
other potentially relevant information such as physical activ-
ity, dietary intake data, or secondary hypertension caused by
other disease etiology.
In conclusion, independent of weight status, age, and race
ethnicity the prevalence of EBP has increased among girls
aged 8­17 years but decreased among adolescent boys aged
13­17 years. Overweight and obesity were significantly associ-
ated with EBP. These observations have clear implications for
public health because increased BP in childhood may result in
cardiovascular diseases in adulthood.
