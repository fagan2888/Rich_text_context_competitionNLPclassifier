In recent years, social work education has encountered
much change and development in the area of online course
delivery (Cummings, Foels, & Chaffin, 2013). Meanwhile,
a lively debate regarding the proper role and function of dis-
tance pedagogies has emerged in the literature. Cohen
(2003), for example, suggests that there is no substantial dif-
ference between learning outcomes for students in face-to-
face versus distance education courses. Furthermore,
teaching social work courses online may improve students'
ability to rehearse their evaluative and interviewing skills
because the use of technology allows students the advantage
of practicing in a less hectic atmosphere (Cummings et al.,
2013). Importantly, online social work courses can also pro-
vide educational opportunities to a larger student population
than traditional higher education settings (Faul, Frey, &
Barber, 2004).
However, others have argued that online courses are not
the best way for social work students to practice their craft.
Some research has suggested that online social work courses
may cause students to become socially isolated and miss
opportunities to practice interactional skills (Collins,
Coleman, Ing, & Gabor, 2002). Similarly, Banks and Faul
(2007) argue that online courses may come at the expense of
replacing the valuable one-on-one experience that on-cam-
pus classes provide. Outside of this debate, the growth of
distance technology in higher education in general has meant
that a greater number of social work students are receiving
their education either partially or completely online. It is,
therefore, critical to continue exploring the outcomes and
experiences of distance social work students.
Research in this area has been largely positive. For exam-
ple, a study conducted by Cummings et al. (2013) contrasted
the learning outcomes for social work students who partici-
pated in online sections of a graduate evidence-based prac-
tice with groups course with on-campus students of the same
course. The primarily online sections of the course also con-
sisted of a few face-to-face Saturday sessions. When com-
paring the online and face-to-face students, there was no
substantial difference discovered between the two cohorts in
the areas of knowledge of leadership skills, exam scores
or students' evaluations of effectiveness of the course
(Cummings et al., 2013). This is noteworthy because
students taking the online course were employed at jobs
for many more hours than face-to-face students, therefore

Student Attitudes Toward Poverty
in a Social Welfare Policy Course:
Online Versus Face to Face
Leah Hamilton1 and Lindsay Daughtry1
Abstract
The growth of online higher education has presented important questions for social workers in academia. Can a human-based
profession be properly taught online? In macro courses, are social work students able to gain a complex understanding of
human experience, social justice, and oppression without the benefit of face-to-face debate and dialogue? In an undergraduate
social welfare policy course, pre and post anonymous opinions surveys were collected on the causes of poverty. Students in
both a face-to-face and an online course section, were asked to rate their agreement with the statements "Poverty is usually
caused by individual actions" and "Poverty is usually caused by societal actions." While no statistically significant changes
appeared for face-to-face students, online students were more likely to decrease blame for individual actions and increased
attribution for societal actions at posttest. Reasons for this difference will be discussed, including the possible role of peer
influence in face-to-face course sessions.

having obligations and time constraints elsewhere. Further-
more, distance education students reported high levels of
approval for the course and their instructor.
Another study, conducted by Wilke and Vinton (2006),
evaluated the first cohorts of an all-online advanced standing
master's of social work program. The authors compared the
cohorts with an on-campus cohort of also advanced standing
students. Results indicated that there were several differ-
ences demographically between the two groups, such as stu-
dents of the online cohort having more job experience than
those in the on-campus cohort. However, few differences
existed in regard to satisfaction and educational outcomes at
the end of the program.
Although social work practice instructors ought to con-
tinue investigation of the acquisition of interactional skills in
an online format, policy teachers must consider whether the
online environment lends itself to a sophisticated under-
standing of social and economic inequality or acquisition of
advocacy skills. The Council on Social Work Education's
(CSWE; 2008) Educational Policy and Accreditation
Standard (EPAS) 2.1.5 calls for the advancement of social
and economic fairness and basic human rights. This policy
explains that social workers are expected to promote human
rights and social justice for all. Social workers are also
expected to comprehend the various forms of repression and
discrimination that affect others and participate in exercises
that assist in bringing forth societal and economic justice
(Council on Social Work Education, 2008).
Measuring these skills, however, can be elusive. Some have
begun by measuring student attitudes toward those in poverty.
The study of attitudes in the field of social work is important as
these beliefs may influence practice interactions, voting behav-
iors, and willingness to advocate for change (Cozzarelli, Tagler,
& Wilkinson, 2001). A study conducted by Cozzarelli et al.
(2001) sought to examine feelings about poverty, stereotypes
directed at those in poverty, and the attributions of poverty
among 209 undergraduate students. Results indicated that ste-
reotypes in relation to the poor were much more negative when
contrasted with stereotypes in relation to the middle class.
Overall, participants were more likely to blame those in pov-
erty themselves as opposed to some other cause. However,
opinions tended to vary depending on the individual's sociode-
mographic background (Cozzarelli et al., 2001).
Similarly, Schwartz and Robinson (1991) examined the
perceptions of reasons for poverty from three different
groups of social work students enrolled in undergraduate
courses. The three groups consisted of students at the begin-
ning of their coursework, students midway through, and stu-
dents close to graduating. Students who had completed
coursework in social policy rendered less significance toward
"blaming the victim" justifications of poverty than their less-
progressed counterparts. These results may suggest that
social work students are able to gain more social-justice-
oriented conceptions of poverty over the course of their edu-
cation (Schwartz & Robinson, 1991).
Still, it is important to establish whether these same gains
can be made in an online education format, and a paucity of
research exists to explore this question. The current study
examines student attitudes toward poverty in one 200-level
social work course titled "The American Social Welfare
System." The course is required for social work majors and
is also approved for general education credit, which means
that student participants included both social work majors
and nonmajors. In general, the course covers social welfare
policy history, social inequality, and poverty. The assigned
textbook is Jansson's (2014) Reluctant Welfare State, which
presents social welfare policy via the lens of the National
Association of Social Workers's (2008) Code of Ethics. The
primary aim of this study was to determine whether differ-
ences existed in student attitudes toward poverty before and
after the course. Furthermore, an online section of the course
was developed in Spring 2014, and this study seeks to deter-
mine whether changes in students attitudes differed across
face-to-face and online sections.
Method
Students in this course self-select into either a face-to-face or
online section, therefore creating a nonrandom sample.
Although demographics were not collected for purposes of
full anonymity (to be discussed in greater detail later in this
section), it may be useful to describe the demographics of the
university overall: a medium-sized university in theAmerican
southeast; the majority of students are White (85%), female
(55%), middle class, and traditional aged (average is 20.93
years; Appalachian State University, 2014). It is the observa-
tion of the instructor that students in this course largely
match the demographics of the university overall, with the
possible exception of a higher percentage of females in a
social work course.
The primary author was also the sole instructor for all
course sections under analysis, which include spring, sum-
mer, and fall 2014, and spring 2015. The face-to-face course
met two times per week for lecture and discussion, with sup-
plemental material provided via the Learning Management
System (LMS). This material included reading quizzes,
PowerPoint slides, several documentaries, and supplemental
reading materials. The online sections of the course include
the same LMS materials, with the addition of asynchronous
discussion boards and a few additional assignments. The
online course was conducted entirely asynchronously
although students were free to schedule face-to-face meet-
ings with the instructor as needed.
During the first and last week of the described course,
students were invited to respond to two statements on a five-
point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly
disagree) via the online LMS (Moodle). These statements
include "Poverty is usually caused by societal actions" and
"Poverty is usually caused by individual actions." A valid
and reliable scale of attitudes toward poverty was developed
Hamilton and Daughtry 3
by Atherton, Gemmel, Haagenstad, and Holt (1993).
However, the instructor chose not to utilize this scale for two
reasons. First, the scale includes such statements as "Poor
people are dishonest." The primary author/course instructor
worried that such phrasing would set a negative tone for the
course, especially when used in a pretest. Second, the scale
includes 37 items and might have produced lower response
rates among time-limited college students.
All responses were anonymous and students were
informed that they were free to decline to participate without
consequence to their course grade. Students were also pro-
vided with information regarding institutional review board
procedures and approval. This anonymity was important due
to the author/instructor's apprehension that any identifying
information might influence student honesty. However, ano-
nymity also produced significant challenges for analysis.
Because individual student changes could not be tracked, it
was impossible to conduct any sort of regression. Instead, a
related samples Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was employed
to analyze pre­post changes in student responses and an indi-
vidual sample Mann­Whitney U test was conducted to com-
pare face-to-face versus online students. Data analysis was
conducted via the SPSS program with charts created via the
Excel program.
Findings
With five online sections (n = 154 at pretest, n = 137 at post-
test) and three face-to-face sections (n = 100 at pretest, n =
92 at posttest) during the 18 months under examination, the
sample included a total of 254 participants at pretest and 229
at posttest. Attrition is most likely explained by students
dropping the course or not completing course requirements.
Response rates were fairly high, with an average of one to
two students declining to participate in each course section.
The first research question sought to discover changes in
the total population over the length of the course. For the
entire sample, students significantly decreased (p = .000)
their agreement with the statement "Poverty is usually caused
by individual actions" from a mean score of 3.67 (3 = neutral,
4 = disagree) to 3.70 at posttest. At the same time, students
(N) significantly increased (p = .035) their agreement with the
statement "Poverty is usually caused by societal actions"
from a mean score of 2.48 (2 = agree, 3 = neutral) to 2.27 at
posttest.
The second research question was answered in two ways.
First, we examined differences between online and face-to-
face students at pretest and posttest. For each of the two
statements, there were no statistically significant differences
at either pretest or posttest. Second, we examined in-group
changes for each of the two statements. Contrary to findings
for the full sample, face-to-face students actually increased
their agreement with the statement "Poverty is usually caused
by individual actions" from a mean score of 3.77 (3 = neu-
tral, 4 = disagree) at pretest to 3.73 at posttest. However,
these changes were slight and not statistically significant (p
= .289). At the same time, face-to-face students increased
their agreement with the statement "Poverty is usually caused
by societal actions" from a mean score of 2.50 (2 = agree, 3
= neutral) at pretest to 2.35 at posttest. These changes were
also not statistically significant (p = .670).
Changes for online students were statistically signifi-
cant for both statements and most likely influenced the
outcomes of the full sample. Web students significantly
decreased (p = .000) their agreement with the statement
"Poverty is usually caused by individual actions" from a
mean score of 3.60 (3 = neutral, 4 = disagree) at pretest to
3.68 at posttest. Meanwhile, these students significantly
increased (p = .011) their agreement with the statement
"Poverty is usually caused by societal actions" from a
mean score of 2.46 (2 = agree, 3 = neutral) at pretest to
2.19 at posttest. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the mean changes
in each group for the two statements.
Discussion
The quasi-experimental design of this study represents a sig-
nificant limitation for interpretation. Self-selection of the
students into either the face-to-face or online sections of the
course (and resultant nonrandom sample) could significantly

influence findings. It is likely that students were self aware
when registering for the course and chose the section that
best supported their own learning styles. This could mean
that students who are less comfortable with distance tech-
nologies would get less out of the course than those who
willingly volunteer. Furthermore, the guarantee of full ano-
nymity limited tracking of individual changes and the oppor-
tunity for more sophisticated methods of analysis. However,
it is also possible that this anonymity presented a strength by
encouraging greater honesty and increasing response rates.
Finally, attrition rates may have also influenced results.
Students who were put off by the social justice orientation of
the course (and, therefore, less likely to report favorable
changes at course end) may have been more likely to drop
the course midterm.
One of the most interesting outcomes of this research is
the mean increase of agreement for both statements, "Poverty
is usually caused by individual actions" and "Poverty is usu-
ally caused by societal actions," among face-to-face stu-
dents. The primary author/instructor assumed that these
statements would have an inverse relationship. It is possible
that the discussion-based model for the face-to-face section
either confused the issue for some students or created a more
complex understanding. It is also important to note that in the
American southeast, it is not uncommon to have very out-
spoken and politically conservative students dominate class-
room conversations. It is possible that these comments
swayed previously neutral students. However, these results
should not be weighted heavily as neither change was statis-
tically significant. The fact that statistically significant
changes were observed among online students is noteworthy.
It is possible that in an introductory course, there is value in
allowing students to absorb the material independently
before being exposed to a discussion-based classroom.
It is recommended that future research in this area find
ways to gather demographic information, individual stu-
dent data, and employ valid and reliable measures without
compromising student honesty or the course atmosphere.
Furthermore, it is as yet unclear whether attitudes toward
poverty are the most effective method of measuring a stu-
dent's acquisition of social justice concepts. Establishing
this relationship or discovering better tools for measuring
CSWE's (2008) macro focused EPAS will be critical to
measuring the true effectiveness of online social work
education.
