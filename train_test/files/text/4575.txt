Introduction
The demographic composition of modern Spain reveals a
multiracial context. The country has the second largest num-
ber of immigrants in the European Union. In the last decade,
the number of non-Spanish residents increased threefold and
now stands at 5.7 million, more than 12% of the population.
The biggest European immigrant groups are from Romania
and the United Kingdom. The greatest numbers of non-Euro-
pean immigrants are from Morocco, followed by those from
Ecuador and Columbia. In the last few years, Spain has also
seen a significant increase in people arriving from Pakistan
and China (Spanish Statistical Office, 2012). With regard to
the education system, a report on the school year 2013/2014
(Spanish Ministry of Education, 2013) indicated that num-
bers of foreign school students had increased in the last
decade: In the 2012/2013 school year, there were 726,781
immigrants in full-time education (9.1% of the school popu-
lation). The biggest group are of South American origin
(34.8%), followed by students from the European Union
(26.1%) andAfrica (27.5%). Students fromAsia and Oceania
make up 7.5% of the total, with 4% coming from the rest of
Europe.
Nevertheless, current educational practices in Spain gen-
erally respond to a homogenized scholastic model that fails
to successfully educate specific groups made up of racial
diverse subjects (Rodríguez, 2010). It is clear that racial ste-
reotypes continue to be rooted in Spanish classrooms.
School textbooks play a central role in the homogenizing
process; they reproduce social images and settings that
reduce the complexity of social reality and offer a differential
schematic that orders and explains that which is configured
as reality (Jorquera, 2010). A substantial amount of informa-
tion that is shown to the student is done so through images
that filter into the collective consciousness, with no prior
reflection, and this makes iconic language a very powerful
medium for the reproduction of stereotypes (Acaso & Nuere,
2005).
With regard to race, the imagery presented in textbooks is
simplistic and, rather than facilitating the construction of
shared identities, it endorses and perpetuates the hegemony
of the (White and Western) in-group (Morales & Lischinsky,
2008; Torres, 2008). The concept of race is still built on erro-
neous biological considerations that are used to transmit
expectations on the performance of individuals that are based
on a supposedly collective potential, a message that responds
to racist biopolitics and corporal differentiation (McDonald,
2013).

Racial Representation in Physical
Education Textbooks for Secondary
Schools: Image Content and Perceptions
Held by Students
María Inés Táboas-Pais1 and Ana Rey-Cao2
Abstract
The purpose of this article is to examine the representation of race through images that are published in Spanish physical
education textbooks for secondary schools and to offer an insight into students' beliefs related to racial stereotypes in
physical education. The sample was composed of 2,583 images and 87 secondary school pupils. The analysis was carried out
through the elaboration of an ad hoc coding scheme. The results showed that people whose appearance is similar to the
in-group predominate. The kind of physical activity, the field, space, and level of competence vary according to race. The
textbooks analyzed in this study engender a stigmatized vision of racial diversity, and the images reproduce and reinforce
racial prejudice.

This research project aims to identify the level of racial
diversity with regard to the people represented in the images
contained in Spanish physical education textbooks. It is clear
that the iconic messages presented are perceived as an objec-
tive reflection of reality, and, in particular, for those students
between 12 and 15 years of age, there is a tendency to legiti-
mize identity with images that are considered an "undeniable
reality" (Revuelta, 2008). The referential function of the
photograph is of primary interest for this project so the anal-
ysis tools use observable "indicators" that provoke the per-
ception of difference. As authors, we are conscious of the
limitations of this type of phenotypical analysis (the analysis
of representations of race in images in physical education
textbooks was confined to observable phenotypic indica-
tors), not least, because it relies on the concept of race that,
in both its biologistic and cultural construction, represents a
regulatory fiction through which certain differences are
transformed into meaningful concepts that legitimize oppres-
sion, exclusion, privilege, and dominance (McDonald, 2013;
Romero, 2003). Nevertheless, the coding scheme used in this
work is utilized as a tool for identifying observable indica-
tors in the photographs considered that act as "semiotic-
material" references in the consciousness of the people who
view them, and this leads to a process of the development of
"ethno-racial" subjectivities:
. . . these are not a reflection of a biological reality or the effect
of social ordering and interpretation; they are a product of the
profoundly unequal, multiple relationships between elements
such as: bodies; legislative apparatus; media images; specific
locations; celebrations; meals; accents; ways of looking; police
controls; dress; fears; scientific activities; the globalised
economy; descriptions of the human genome; legalisation
papers; position in the labour market; racisms etc. (Romero,
2003, p. 125)
Homogenization of Corporal Culture Through
Physical Education and Sport
Corporal culture can be conceptualized as a group of values,
uses, knowledge, beliefs, norms, and behavior patterns that
delimit corporal appreciation and practices in a given social
context. The biopolitical concept provides a framework for
the interpretation of physical education and sport1 as prac-
tices inserted in mechanisms for the control and regulation of
the population (Foucault, 2009) and the homogenizing and
globalizing (Mella, 2005). In this way, the universalizing of
sport has contributed to the reduction of the variety and
diversity of corporal and motor expressions, which have
become limited to a dominant cultural model (Barbero, 2006;
Vicente, 2007).
Due to its close relationship with sport, physical education
is particularly susceptible to discourses relating to corporal
differentiation. The culture of "performativity" has domi-
nated educational discourse, affecting the way in which pupils
think and act toward physical education (Evans, 2013). The
obsession of explaining the phenomenon of human physical
performance has tended to treat people in a technological and
mechanical manner, and this has led to the legitimization of
reductionist and determinist interpretations of racial distinc-
tion that support arguments on differences in motor perfor-
mance (McDonald, 2013). Hill and Azzarito (2012) explored
a number of the ways that young women visualized valued
bodies and found that more than half of the posters that the
girls created portrayed White men. Only one portrayed
women of color, and no Asian women were represented in
the posters. As such, legitimate sporting bodies promoted in
the school site were embedded in Whiteness.
In Spain, the mass media minimize the role of specific
racial groups in sport and promote the formation of stereo-
types and prejudicial attitudes (Igartua & Muñiz, 2004;
López, 2005; Muñiz, Igartua, & Otero, 2006). The majority
of advertising images show White people, as do most TV
programs related to sport. This is consistent with research
undertaken in other countries: In the United States, Latin
American and Asian people hardly feature in sports pro-
grams (Billings & Tyler, 2002), and Black people are almost
always seen playing baseball, basketball, American football,
and doing athletics (Lumpkin, 2009; Thomas, 2004).
McCarthy, Jones, and Potrac (2003) argue that the existence
of racial stereotypes in U.K. sports coverage not only makes
some groups invisible but also reflects the structures of
power.
Studies on racial stereotypes reveal that perceptions of
competence and future aspirations for sporting participation
vary among adolescents of different origins (Azzarito &
Solomon, 2006; Harrison, Harrison, & Moore, 2002;
Harrison, Lee, & Belcher, 1999; Harrison, Sailes, Rotich, &
Bimper, 2011), and that students' construction of the ideal
body is racialized (Azzarito, 2009). In accordance with mass
media images, young people attribute certain physical activi-
ties to different racial characteristics (Contreras, Pastor, &
González, 2008; Gil, 2006) and believe that Black people are
physically superior, whereas White people have greater cog-
nitive capacities (Sheldon, Jayaratne, & Petty, 2007). These
stereotyped perceptions are also present in the discourses of
coaches, teachers, and parents; for example, Black people
are more closely identified with athletics, American football,
and basketball (Harrison, Azzarito, & Burden, 2004; Hayes
& Sugden, 1999).
The most recent National Survey on Spanish population
sport behavior (García & Llopis, 2011) found that 45% of
immigrants above the age of 15 participate in sport.
Immigrants of African origin are the most active (46%), fol-
lowed by South Americans (45%) and Europeans (42.1%).
In terms of the type of activity, results of another study by
Llopis (2005) indicate that Africans prefer running, Latin
Americans enjoy team sports (especially football), and
Europeans are more interested in mountaineering, tennis,
swimming, walking, skating, gymnastics, tennis, and team
sports.

This data demonstrate that race must be considered a
powerful influence on patterns of participation and perfor-
mance (Harrison et al., 2011).
Racial Stereotypes, Textbooks, and Physical
Education
Although many studies have examined racial stereotyping in
school textbooks used in a variety of courses and subjects,
physical education textbooks have received little attention.
This might be explained by the fact that the use of textbooks
in physical education is relatively recent. In Spain, the first
empirical analysis of physical education textbooks did not
appear until the 1990s, and research has focused on gender
stereotypes. Only a few contemporary works have specifi-
cally examined the representation of race.
Internationally, there is agreement that physical education
textbooks offer a rather unbalanced vision of society that
perpetuates the use of race as a variable that legitimizes the
existence of differences and expectations based on racial
groups (McDonald, 2013). The images shown in textbooks
are almost exclusively of White or Caucasian people
(Botelho, Silva, Queirós, & Caetano, 2008), Black people
are closely linked to specific athletic activities (McDonald,
2013), and other social realities are silenced by the dominant
culture (Hsu & Chepyator-Thomson, 2010).
All these studies revealed racial stereotyping presented in
the educational materials. This study attempted to seek an
answer to the following question: What are the patterns of
race that are being conveyed by Spanish physical education
textbooks?
This analysis contributes to research initiated by these and
other authors within the literature related to physical educa-
tion and sport pedagogy because, specifically, studied how
the physical education is "encoded" with particular concep-
tions of race, and how these may impact students'
perceptions.
Objectives
This work aims to characterize the patterns of race that are
transmitted by physical education textbooks in compulsory
secondary education in Spain. The following hypotheses
were advanced:
Hypothesis 1: People from the in-group (White and
Western) are represented in textbooks with greater fre-
quency than other racial groups.
Hypothesis 2: Black people, Asians, and people from
other racial groups are mainly shown participating in tra-
ditional sports, and to a much lesser extent, in artistic
activities in the natural environment or playing other
types of games.
Hypothesis 3: Black people,Asians, and people from other
racial groups are usually shown in competitive activities,
whereas White people are more commonly shown partici-
pating in non-competitive activities.
Hypothesis 4: Black people, Asians, and people from
other racial groups are more frequently shown participat-
ing in elite sports than White people.
Hypothesis 5: Images of people from the out-group
shown in textbooks generate greater prejudice among the
students than images of the in-group (White and Western).
Method
The study was based on two methods: (a) a content analysis
of images in Spanish physical education textbooks using
synchronic, empirical, descriptive, and non-experimental
techniques, and (b) a test of secondary school students' per-
ceptions of a set of images.
Sample
Method 1.The content analysis considered 2,583 photo-
graphs from 36 textbooks from 10 Spanish publishing
houses. Of the original total (N = 3,316), 733 (22.10%) were
discounted as it was not possible to identify the racial origin
of the people shown, for example, due to the wide-angle
focus that was used.
Method 2. The sample comprised 87 students (45 males and
42 females), aged between 12 and 17. Selection criteria were
accessibility (the collaboration of the school authorities) and
the inclusion of students from each year of compulsory sec-
ondary education.
Variables
The analyzed variables were race, type of physical activity,
field of practice, and level of activity. Operational definitions
are given in Table 1.
Procedure
Method 1. The codification system for the content analysis
utilized a number of sources and strategies. The starting
point was López's (2005) "publicity image analysis system."
In addition to the categories that were theoretically or deduc-
tively derived, the codification process was amplified
through an inductive or empirical procedure that was the
result of a first "superficial viewing" of the images. The cat-
egories that were identified in this first viewing were defined
in conjunction with specific literature; there were five phases:
1. Initial trial test. The compilation of categories used
by López (2005) was applied to a set of images taken
from physical education textbooks. Issues that
emerged during the initial viewings of the images
also determined several other categories used in the
4 SAGE Open
study. In addition to the categories that a priori orga-
nized and systemized the test, the procedure was also
exploratory: It allowed the researcher to identify new
categories and indicators and eliminate others that
were shown to be irrelevant to the objectives of the
analysis.
2. Second trial test.Acode and an operational definition
were assigned to each of the dimensions and catego-
ries. A second trial test was carried out to corroborate
the validity of the categories. One hundred sixty-
eight images were coded.
3. Consultation with experts. Three content analysis
experts participated in the study; two of them hold
doctorates in physical education and habitually use
content analysis as their main research technique.
The third expert is a doctor of philosophy and litera-
ture and has a BA in library science and documenta-
tion; she is the author of a number of studies based on
the content analysis of images and has published a
number of articles on content and image analysis of
documents. The objective of the consultation with
experts was the validation of the coding categories.
Table 1. Coding Scheme.
Categories/indicators Operational definitions
Race
White People characterized by white skin; appearance corresponding to a European origin.
Black People characterized by black skin; appearance corresponding to an African origin.
Asian People characterized by a yellow or clear skin tone, dark eyes, and an epicanthic fold;
appearance corresponding to an Asian origin.
 Latin American People characterized by brown skin, dark eyes, prominent cheeks, dark hair, nose
and lips larger than Europeans; appearance corresponding to a Latin American
origin.
Others Those people not included in the above categories.
Various People belonging to other racial groups.
Kind of physical activity
 Team sports Sports played in teams, in collaboration/opposition. For example, basketball, handball,
football, hockey, rugby, baseball, water polo, polo, and volleyball.
 Individual sports Sports where participation is individual, without team mates and/or which can be
played against an opponent(s). For example, swimming, track and field, gymnastics,
rowing, cycling, tennis, boxing, judo, golf, motorcycling, and weightlifting.
Artistic Activities that use the body as the means for artistic expression. For example,
activities related to mime, theater, drama, and dance.
 Fitness and physical conditioning Activities directed toward improving strength, speed, flexibility, and/or resistance.
For example, running, bodybuilding, stretching, aerobics, step, spinning, and aquafit.
 Physical activities in natural environments Activities such as paragliding, bungee jumping, cycling, trekking, hiking, rock climbing,
surfing, and rafting.
Games Leisure activities whose basic characteristic is the acceptance of simple rules that can
be modified and adapted according to the group. For example, floorball, spongee
polo, and korfball.
Other The image shows an activity that is not included in one of the previous subcategories.
Field of practice
Competitive Activities that belong to the field of institutionalized competition. The presence of
referees, a playing field with the regulatory dimensions or numbers on shirts that
can indicate a competitive context.
 Formal educational Activities in the context of formal education; there are clear signs that the image
belongs to a school. The school gym, the playground, the school cafeteria, and the
classroom are typical locations.
 Other (non-competitive) Fields of practice that are clearly different from institutionalized competition. They
include tilitarian contexts (workplaces, Shops, the home, and hospitals, etc.) and
recreational contexts (parks, the street, etc.).
Level
Elite People famous for the activity they carry out appear (elite sportsmen, famous
dancers, actors, etc.), as well as indicators such as the public or sponsors who
make it possible to place the action at the Olympic Games, a league, a professional
championship, or any other type of spectacle of general interest.
Non-elite People who are not famous for the activity they carry out appear, and there are no
indicators that make it possible to place the action at the Olympic Games, a league,
a professional championship, or any other spectacle of general interest.
Táboas-Pais and Rey-Cao 5
The experts were asked to complete a questionnaire
giving their opinions on five items: suitability of the
coding scheme, precision of categories, mutual
exclusion of categories, clarity of definitions, and
minimization of the subjectivity of the observer. Data
were collected by means of the Likert-type scale,
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree), and complementary, qualitative information.
4. Second consultation with experts. After making the
necessary modifications, the new coding scheme, the
corrected definitions, and the questionnaire used in
the first consultation were returned to the experts. All
items were given a rating of 4 or 5.
5. Triangulation with observers. Three observers were
given training on the coding system and codebook,
using images from textbooks that were not in the
final sample. The objective was to familiarize the
researchers with the pictures, the coding system, the
codebook, and registration. The three observers were
then randomly assigned 74 images from textbooks.
Thirty of them were selected by simple random sam-
pling through a table of random numbers; 44 were
selected by non-random sampling. The selection cri-
terion was that all the indicators in the coding scheme
had to be codified. Intercoder reliability statistics
were calculated to assess agreement. The kappa reli-
ability (>.80) was therefore satisfactory for all cate-
gories: type of physical activity (M  = .90), field of
practice (M  = .86), and level (M  = .84). The inter-
coder reliability served as content for a pilot reliabil-
ity test before full coding commenced; the pilot gave
the researchers a final opportunity to alter the coding
scheme to maximize reliability.
When reliability levels were considered adequate (based
on the results of the reliability pilot test), another representa-
tive sample was used to assess reliability for the full sample
to be coded. Cohen's kappa was also calculated for the cod-
ing of the final sample of photographs. For the second inter-
coder reliability analyses, 273 images (more than 10% of the
full sample) were selected by simple random sampling using
a table of random numbers. According to Lacy and Riffe
(1996), the appropriate size of the sample should not be less
than 50 units, or 10% of the full sample, and it will rarely
need to be greater than 300 units. Cohen's kappa revealed a
high degree of reliability: type of physical activity (M  =
.86), field of practice (M  = .92); level (M  = .88).
Method 2. The test of perception of images was oriented at
gaining an understanding of the variables that attracted the
attention of the young people who saw them in physical edu-
cation textbooks. The test was developed in four phases: (a)
design of the first draft of the test, (b) consultation with four
experts, (c) a pilot test with students from 4 years of
compulsory secondary education (n = 94), and (d) the design
of the definitive perception test.
During the implementation of the definitive test, 15
images taken from physical education textbooks were pro-
jected in the classroom. The images were selected in accor-
dance with the results of Method 1, with the aim that they
would be representative. The protocol was as follows:
1. The students were given the "Description and
Opinion" form.
2. The students read the instructions for the test, and
any questions or doubts were dealt with. The instruc-
tion was to describe what they saw in the images.
3. Each of the 15 images was shown for 1 min. The stu-
dents gave a written description of the image with
their opinions.
4. The students handed in the completed "Description
and Opinion" form.
Analysis and Data Processing
Method 1. All images were digitized to facilitate coding. The
registration process was carried out manually, using a chart
for each textbook.
The statistical analysis used SPSS software 15.0 for
Windows. The processing of the information involved
descriptive univariate analysis and associative measures
between the different variables or categories (bivariate anal-
ysis). Contingency tables were used to compare the observed
frequencies and percentages. The Pearson chi-square statis-
tic significance level (testing independence) was set at 5%
( = .05) and used to identify associations between the
variables.
The corrected normalized residuals were utilized to com-
pare results; the marginal values, sample size, and the num-
ber of cases in which each remainder was based would
otherwise have made it impossible. For the confidence level
set for this study (95%), the corrected normalized residuals
indicated that the difference between observed frequency
and expected frequency was high when its absolute value
was above 1.96. Therefore, a corrected normalized residual
with an absolute value greater than 1.96 indicates that there
are more cases (if it is positive) or less cases (if it is negative)
than could be expected if the variables were independent.
However, a value between ±1.96 indicates that the difference
between observed frequency and expected frequency is small
and the variables are independent.
Method 2. The descriptions of the students were subjected to
a content analysis, using the N-VIVO 8 program for the cat-
egorization of the comments. The software allowed the orga-
nization and reduction of the data into content analysis
categories. The initial categories were the same as the con-
tent analysis of the images, and these were added to by
6 SAGE Open
categories that were inductively derived from the first read-
ing of the students' descriptions.
Results
Hypothesis 1: Prevalence of White People
The most numerous group featured in physical education
textbooks for secondary schools in Spain is White people
(the in-group); they appeared in 2,256 photos (87.34% of the
total). This was followed by images that showed individuals
from different races at the same time (192 photos, 7.43% of
the total); Black people (92 photos, 3.56% of the total),
Asians (28 photos, 1.08% of the total), Latin Americans (4
photos, 0.15% of the total), and other racial groups (11 pho-
tos, 0.43% of the total).
There were some differences among the publishing
houses: the percentage of photographs featuring non-White
people ranged from 1.22 to 12.99. The highest percentage of
interracial images from one publishing house was 28, and the
lowest was below 3 (see Table 2).
Hypothesis 2: Type of Physical Activity According
to Racial Group
The analysis of the relationship between the variables of
racial group and type of physical activity was undertaken by
means of contingency tables and the Pearson 2 test. When
the two variables were interrelated, a critical value was
obtained, which was associated to the 2 statistic, lower than
0.05 (p value = .000). This means that the type of physical
activity in which the textbooks showed the participants par-
ticipating varied according to race ( = .05).
Of the images that featured White people, 19.2% involved
team sports, 22.4% individual sports, 10% artistic activities,
15.8% fitness and physical conditioning, 9% physical activi-
ties in a natural environment, 9.7% games, and 13.9%
showed individuals involved in other types of activities:
White people were shown as participating in a wide variety
of physical activities. Individuals from Black, Asian, Latin
American, and other groups were shown playing sports in
74.8% of the pictures (54.8% individual sports and 20%
team sports); depiction of their participation in non-sporting
activities was very limited: 9.6% fitness and physical condi-
tioning, 5.9% games, 2.2% artistic activities, 0.7% activities
in the natural environment, and 6.7% other activities.
Furthermore, Black people were especially shown as partici-
pating in sport (82.6%) and specifically in individual sports
such as track and field (63%).
There was a similar pattern in interracial images: 78.6%
of photographs that featured individuals from different racial
backgrounds were of sport (43.2% team sports, 35.4% indi-
vidual sports) with only 5% involving other physical
activities.
The last line in each cell of Table 3 shows high corrected
normalized residuals: There is a strong relationship between
the variables. The probability that Black people and interracial
groups did sport and no other types of physical activities was
significantly higher than would be expected if the variables
were independent (remainders of 5.2 and 6.6, respectively).
Hypothesis 3: Field of Practice and Race
The contexts that were linked to the people represented in the
textbooks also varied according to the race to which the indi-
vidual belongs. A .000 significance was obtained with
Pearson's chi-square test, which allowed the rejection of the
null hypothesis with a confidence level of 95%. As Table 4
shows, individuals from Black, Asian, and other groups were
almost exclusively depicted in competition (75%, 56.5%, and
42.9%, respectively) and were excluded from educational
contexts. In the case of Asians and Latin Americans, the per-
centage of pictures in formal educational contexts was 0.
Interracial groups were also more frequent in competitive
fields of practice (78.6%). In formal educational contexts or
other fields, the figure was much lower (8.2%). In contrast,
White people were mainly linked to non-competitive contexts.
In the images of competitive activities, there was a sig-
nificantly higher proportion of individuals from "other"
racial groups in comparison with White people (typified
residuals of 9.1 and 14.7 compared with -17.8). In the
remaining fields of practice (educational and non-competi-
tive), there was a significantly higher proportion of White
people than people from other racial groups.
Hypothesis 4: Level of Activity and Race
The Pearson chi-square test results also indicated (signifi-
cance level of .05) that there was a relationship between racial
group and participation in elite level sports (p value = .000).
There was a much higher proportion of pictures of White
people in non-elite sports contexts than there were in elite
sports (86.3%, compared with 13.7%). This statistic was

corroborated by the corrected normalized residuals (-19.8
and 19.8). The proportion of pictures depicting Black people
involved in elite-level competitive sports was much higher
than the images of activities not related to elite sports (67.4%
compared with 32.6%). The corrected normalized residuals
were 11.6 and -11.6.
The percentage of interracial group pictures depicting
people engaging in elite sports was also higher than that of
interracial pictures referring to non-elite sports activities
(63.6 compared with 36.4). The corrected typified remain-
ders showed that these differences were statistically signifi-
cant: 15.1 and -15.1 (see Table 5).
Hypothesis 5: Images of People From the Out-
Group in Physical Education Textbooks Engender
Greater Prejudices Than the Images of the In-
Group
Sixty-one of the 87 participants (70.11%) wrote some type of
comment relating to the racial group of the people featured in
the images. A common discourse included reference to
"those others," especially Black people, as "those people
from over there," "not from here." A Black person is often
seen as belonging to "a different team and a different coun-
try" (Student 76). In some cases, their presence was consid-
ered a problem, both in sporting terms, "the black guy is
cheating, he's pushing the white guy to get the ball off him"
(Student 73), and in terms of the wider society, "the Chinese
are invading us" (Student 27).
Activities such as football and athletics are seen as most
adequate for Black people; the arguments are generalized
stereotypes: "black people are usually stronger" (Student 6),
"black people run a lot" (Student 46). Students appear to
attribute a certain physical superiority to Black people and
place them exclusively in competitive environments: "they
are the best athletes and help to raise the level of the competi-
tion" (Student 87).

Discussion
The Absence of Diversity
Hypothesis 1 was confirmed. Individuals with a different
appearance to the in-group (White and Western) are very
much excluded from images shown in Spanish schools'
physical education textbooks. This finding coincides with
results of research on TV programs and advertising related to
physical activity and sport (Billings & Tyler, 2002; López,
2005) and the few published studies on physical education
textbooks to date (Botelho et al., 2008): There is almost
exclusive representation of Caucasian people and an absence
of other racial groups. Black people are the second most rep-
resented group, with a much lower percentage. This lack of
racial diversity is not exclusive to physical education; previ-
ously published works have found similar disparities in other
subject areas (Morales & Lischinsky, 2008; Torres, 2008).
Racial Stereotypes and Physical Activity
Hypothesis 2 was confirmed. The analysis revealed the
assignation of a specific type of physical activity based on
racial appearance. No previously published works on the
relationships between racial variables and physical activities
in school textbook images have been found. Nevertheless, a
study by McDonald (2013) on the configuration of the con-
cept of race in the textual content of physical education text-
books concurred with the results of this current article and
argued that textbook discourses emphasize the superiority of
the "black race" in the sprint and running disciplines of ath-
letics. Similar conclusions have been drawn with regard to
the representation of Black people in the mass media in the
United States--representation is almost exclusively oriented
toward baseball, basketball, and American football (Thomas,
2004). We were unable to corroborate the association of
Black people with baseball; as it is not a sport that features in
Spanish physical education textbooks, we could, however,
consider athletics, basketball, and American football. The
results coincided with the opinions of the students (who
linked these sports with Black people) and the results of a
number of other studies (Azzarito & Solomon, 2006).
Hypotheses 3 and 4 were confirmed. Black people were
frequently depicted in competitive, high-level sporting activ-
ities. Images in Spanish physical education textbooks trans-
mit the message that racial diversity neither exists in the
school nor in recreational contexts. People who are different
from the White and Western model are only shown in institu-
tionalized competitive, high-performance sporting contexts,
and this might be the reason for beliefs concerning physical-
conditioning superiority (Contreras et al., 2008; Harrison et
al., 2004; McDonald, 2013; Sheldon et al., 2007) and homog-
enized sporting activities (Barbero, 2006; Mella, 2005).
Hypothesis 5 was confirmed through the opinions of the
students that evidenced racial stereotypes and prejudices.
The students commonly referred to the "others" as "foreign-
ers" and problematized their presence in both sporting and
non-sporting contexts. The students perceived the existence
of different sports and physical activities in terms of race and
considered competition and high-performance sports to be
the most adequate for Black people. Following the argument
of Harrison et al. (2004), the stereotyped messages implicit
in physical education and sport often promote stereotypes
based on physical superiority. Nevertheless, the real differ-
ences are based on social forces that construct the reality, not
on genetic or biological aspects. There is no scientific evi-
dence that substantiates theories that aim to explain the phys-
ical superiority of Black people or their supposed intellectual
failures in comparison with White people (Hayes & Sugden,
1999).
Conclusion
School textbooks are not coherent with educational policies
that favor interracial education and learning. The images in
secondary school physical education textbooks portray a
racial homogeneity with majority representation of the in-
group (White and Western), compared with the minority rep-
resentation of people from different races (the out-groups).
Táboas-Pais and Rey-Cao 9
The messages transmitted by the images shown in Spanish
physical education textbooks do not facilitate the construc-
tion of racial diverse and shared identities: People with a dif-
ferent appearance from the in-group (mainly Black people)
are only represented in a limited number of contexts that are
stereotyped in accordance with conceptions of "race." They
only appear in sports and activities such as football, basket-
ball, and athletics and are excluded from artistic physical
activities or games that take place in the natural environ-
ment. In general, Black people,Asians, and other people who
are not from the in-group are always linked to competition
and elite sport, and are excluded from recreational or utilitar-
ian contexts in the educational environment.
These sporting contexts, mainly basketball and football in
high-performance competition, offer a biased vision of cor-
poral culture and reinforce racial prejudice and stereotypes.
This analysis makes a contribution to the body of research
that was initiated by other authors from many countries (e.g.,
Azzarito & Solomon, 2005; Flintoff, 2015; Grahn, 2014;
Harrison et al., 2002). Grahn (2014) studied textbooks used
in coaching education programs in Sweden and demonstrated
that textbooks construct gender differences. Recently, Anne
Flintoff (2015) concluded by arguing for a critical analysis of
the construction of Whiteness through physical education
teacher education. This study demonstrates the need to raise
awareness with regard to the content of physical education
textbooks and the importance of working to overcome racial
stereotypes associated with sport and physical education.
Publishing houses and education authorities must become
fully aware of the contents of physical education textbooks
to become involved in their improvement. Teachers must
analyze the books from a critical point of view to be able to
use them in a coherently didactic way. In this respect, the
teachers' initial training should enable them to reflect and
become aware of the implications that school materials can
have in racial differences.
