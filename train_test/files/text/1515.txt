Abstract
This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between fertility and poverty
for Indonesia, a country which has experienced unprecedented economic growth and
sharp fertility decline over recent decades. We illustrate the sensitivity of the effect of
fertility on household consumption with respect to the equivalence scale in a unitary
household framework. Using the propensity score matching method, the analysis sug-
gests that a newborn child decreases household consumption per person by 20 percent
within four years. When the estimates of equivalence scales implied by the Indonesian
sample are applied, the effect of a child on household consumption is still negative, but
the magnitudes are in the range of 20 to 65 percent of that found with the per-capita ex-
penditure as a measure of consumption. Therefore, it is suggested that analysis based
on the conventional measure of poverty is likely to exaggerate the effect of fertility on
poverty at least because of neglect of the proper equivalence scale. Given that household
preference for consumption of private goods such as children's education is negatively
associated with fertility, the test for household bargaining supports the model of the uni-
tary household as a valid assumption for examining the relationship between fertility and
household consumption.

1. Introduction
The causal relationship between population growth and standard of living has long been
of interest to policymakers. While the estimates of the effect of fertility on poverty range
from being significantly positive to insignificant, a growing body of literature suggests
that the true relationship is likely to be more complicated than unidirectional (e.g. Bird-
sall et al. 2001). The relationship between poverty and fertility is not unidirectional
but dependent on the stage of economic development (McNicoll 1997, Schoumaker and
Tabutin 1999). While in most contemporary developing countries this relationship is
positive, a negative relationship has been reported within the poorest countries. The lat-
ter results are associated with lower reproduction capability and higher rates of infertility
among extremely poor households (Lipton 1998, Livi-Bacci and De Santis 1998). Clearly
many factors that influence fertility also determine well-being. These include education,
health services and family planning policies. In addition to joint causation, reverse causa-
tion may also take place. Among poor households, the demand for children is high since
those households rely on their children's labor supply and often the child's support is crit-
ical when parents become old. Higher fertility in turn is associated with lower investment
in education (i.e. demand for quantity rather than quality of children) and consequently
lower earnings potential for children, which in turn fosters intergenerational transmission
of poverty (Moav 2005).
The theoretical perspectives suggest various mechanisms linking fertility and poverty.
Empirical studies that tried to identify the causal relationship between fertility and poverty
have so far relied on aggregate level data and cross-sectional micro level data (cf. the re-
view by Merrick 2001). With these data, it is difficult to provide robust causal information
about fertility and well-being because fertility and household income are jointly deter-
mined. Recent longitudinal household surveys in developing countries that incorporate
the timing of fertility together with information on consumption expenditure, income and
other measures of well-being allow researchers to identify the dynamic relation between
poverty and fertility. So far, these data sets have not been used to study the link between
poverty and fertility, which is the goal of this paper. In particular, we examine the Indone-
sian experience for which we have excellent longitudinal information on both fertility and
household expenditure, together with a range of other background information.
The most commonly used measure of poverty is a dichotomous variable that indi-
cates whether a household's consumption expenditure is below a certain poverty thresh-
old level. Although this poverty measure is useful in comparing the standard of living
across countries or over time, its analysis cannot measure the magnitude of the effect of
fertility on household consumption. Moreover, the thresholds are often set in an arbitrary
way. Therefore, we examine the relationship between fertility and household consump-
tion directly. It should be noted that the level of consumption is not the only measure
624 http://www.demographic-research.org
Demographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26
of household welfare. In addition, parents may enjoy having children and children may
make the consumption of other goods more enjoyable. However, in light of the Mil-
lennium Development Goals, set out by the United Nations, the materialistic measure of
welfare is clearly of interest.5 As a result, we examine here whether and how much having
an additional child decreases household consumption.
One difficulty in establishing a relationship between fertility and household consump-
tion is related to the measure of consumption (Ravallion 1996). As argued in Lanjouw and
Ravallion (1995) "Despite extensive work on welfare measurement in economics, there
is still no preferred method for making inter-personal comparisons across households of
different size and/or composition." For instance, a common measure of well-being at the
household level is expenditure per adult equivalent. However, assigning equal weight to
all household members and overlooking economy of scale with household size ignores
the compositional and size effect of households on the measure of well-being. As shown
in Lanjouw and Ravallion (1995) for Pakistan, the measure of poverty is sensitive to the
economy of scale parameter that is assumed. In this paper we investigate whether the
causal relation between fertility and household consumption is sensitive to two dimen-
sions of equivalence scale frequently discussed in the literature: the weight of a child's
consumption relative to an adult's and the economy of scale (Banks and Johnson 1994;
Koulovatianos et al. 2005)
A further complication in verifying the relationship between fertility and poverty is the
issue of measuring a variation of fertility that is exogenous with respect to the measures
of well-being. Two approaches have been adopted in the existing literature. The first one
is to use the context of a natural experiment such as samples of twins or the sex composi-
tion of the first two children as an instrumental variable for fertility (e.g. Rosenzweig and
Wolpin 1980; Angrist and Evans 1998). Although these instruments are reasonably valid,
Rosenzweig and Wolpin (2000) note that this approach requires restrictions on the utility
function (e.g. the separability of leisure and consumption, etc.). The second approach is to
use the residual from a fertility regression as a measure of unobserved fecundity (Rosen-
zweig and Schultz 1985). Measuring female fecundity is certainly a useful approach, but
the result is less intuitive. As an alternative approach, we apply here a matching method in
order to estimate the effect of an additional child on household consumption in the short
run. This approach assumes that the event of childbearing is independent of household
consumption given observable characteristics. However, our focus is on illustrating the
extent to which the effect of fertility on poverty depends on the measure of equivalence
scale under a reasonable estimation strategy, and we minimize any possible bias due to

unobservable characteristics by conditioning on an extensive set of observable character-
istics.6
The sensitivity of the effect of fertility on household consumption suggests that the
expenditure share of private good may affect fertility decision. Then, the share of pri-
vate good in household expenditure may be determined by the intrahousehold bargaining
process. Therefore, these possibilities are further investigated in order to find an empirical
evidence that connects unitary and collective models of a household.
Our main finding is that households with a new born child between 1993 and 1997
experience about 20 percent reduction in consumption when per-capita consumption is
used as a measure of household consumption. However, the effect of fertility on con-
sumption is highly sensitive to the choice of the equivalence scale. When we apply the
estimated equivalence scale parameters with further assumptions on household welfare,
the magnitude of the effect of fertility on consumption is in the range 20 to 65 percent of
that found with the per-capita consumption. Therefore, it is suggested that the analysis
based on the conventional measure of poverty is likely to exaggerate the effect of fertility
on poverty at least because of the neglect of the proper equivalence scale. On the other
hand, the household preference for consumption of private goods such as children's edu-
cation is found to be negatively correlated with fertility. Further, the results of the tests for
the household bargaining process supports the framework of a unitary household model,
which is a basic assumption for the analysis of equivalence scale.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the measure of
household consumption and summarizes estimates of the equivalence scale implied by
the data. The method of analysis is discussed in section 3. Section 4 describes the in-
stitutional background, data and variables used in our study. The results on whether and
in which direction fertility causes household consumption are presented in section 5. We
apply household consumption expenditure per person and investigate the sensitivity of
the results depending on the way in which household size and household composition
are taken care of. Section 6 examines the effect of private goods share of expenditure
on fertility and the effect of bargaining power on the share of private goods in household
expenditure. In section 7 we conclude.
2. Measuring household consumption
The most commonly used measure of welfare is household expenditure per person. A
critical issue when considering the effect of a new born child on household consumption
is the definition of the equivalence scale (Lanjouw and Ravallion 1995). One approach
is to directly estimate the cost of a child in terms of an adult's consumption (e.g. Deaton
6 See Mattei (2004) for a similar approach.
626 http://www.demographic-research.org
Demographic Research: Volume 20, Article 26
and Muellbauer 1986). A limitation of this approach is that the calculation is based on
households of a specific demographic type. Therefore, the result is not directly applicable
to households of various demographic types. Unlike developed countries where nuclear
households are common, there are 67 different types of households in our sample with
the numbers of children and adults ranging from zero to ten and from one to twelve, re-
spectively. Although, in principle, it is correct to calculate the cost of a child for each
household type separately, it seems more appropriate here to estimate the effect of a new-
born child in an average household.
One way of estimating the equivalence scale is to use a complete demand system and
to estimate the equivalence scale for a particular type of household compared to a base-
line household (e.g. De Santis and Maltagliani 2003). Our approach is to estimate two
parameters of equivalence scale in a functional form, which can be applied to all house-
holds with different demographic composition. It has the disadvantage of assuming a
particular functional form for the equivalence scale, but, at the same time, has an impor-
tant advantage since it allows us to evaluate the effect of a birth on individual household
consumption, on average, under the equivalence scale implied by the data. The functional
form is widely used, and in this sense we are in line with the majority of the previous
literature.
There are two dimensions of the equivalence scale to be considered: 1) the weight
assigned to children relative to adults, and 2) the economy of scale in household con-
sumption. We adopt a simple form of a welfare measure incorporating these dimensions,
as suggested by Banks and Johnson (1994).7
W =
H
(A + K)
, (1)
where H denotes total household expenditure, and A and K denote the number of adults
and the number of children respectively. A measure of household consumption per equiv-
alence scale, W, is the measure of household consumption when the cost of each member
is taken into account. Therefore, if two households of different demographic character-
istics have the same level of W, then it can be argued that they have the same level of
welfare. In equation (1), the weight for a child relative to an adult is , and the economy
of scale is reflected through the parameter . Both  and  take values between zero
and one. Using the expenditure per person as a measure of household consumption im-
plies that a child consumes as much as an adult and that there is no economy of scale in
consumption of goods ( = 1,  = 1).
7 We are aware that the functional form used in the paper is not the only one used, but this version is a frequently
used specification in the literature (e.g. Banks and Johnson 1994; Koulovatianos et al. 2005).

Kim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?
Since estimating the equivalence scale requires a set of assumptions about the household
preference structure, we first study the effect of a child on consumption expenditure for
different values of the equivalence scale ( = 1/2, 1;  = 1/2, 1), and then apply our
estimates of equivalence scale to illustrate the range of the effect of a child on individual
consumption.
One way to estimate  and  in equation (1) is to use experimental data as in Koulo-
vatianos et al. (2005). Given the lack of the data on direct compensation for an additional
child or an adult, we take an alternative approach using the Engel curve estimation as in
Deaton and Muellbauer (1986).8 That is, under the assumption that the inverse of food
share of expenditure correctly indicates the welfare of household members, we calcu-
late the amount of consumption that is needed in order to compensate for the additional
members of the household compared to the baseline household. A household with two
adults is taken as the baseline, and the estimated equivalence scales for households with
different demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. The estimation procedure
is described in Appendix A. The second row in Table 1 states that a household with two
adults and a child needs 126 percent of the consumption of the reference household in
order to have the same level of welfare, suggesting that a child costs 52 percent of an
adult's consumption.9
It is notable that the estimation procedure taken in the paper considers food as having
a private good aspect. This assumption is not against the finding by Deaton and Paxson
(1998). They show that conditional on the per capita expenditure the food expenditure
per person as a private good should increase as household size increases but that data
suggest the opposite. Since food having a public good aspect did not prove to be a good
explanation for their puzzle, our assumption seems to be reasonable with regard to their
findings.
As Blundell and Lewbel (1991) pointed out, the conditional demand equation can be
used to identify the cost of living indices for different household compositions but not the
true equivalence scale. Restoring the equivalence scale requires an identifying assumption
such as independence of base utility, or the assumption that unconditional preference
orderings depend on demographics only through Barten scales. With this limitation, we
use the relative magnitudes of the costs of additional household members in order to
estimate the parameters of equivalence scale.
8 The Engel curve refers to the demand for a good (food in this case) as a function of income when the prices
are fixed.
9 Using an Indonesian survey (Susenas) in 1978, Deaton and Muellbauer (1986) estimated that a child costs 90
percent of an adult's consumption using Engel's method.

Given that there is a wide variety of household types in the sample, we run the fol-
lowing non-linear regression to find a set of parameters of equivalence scale, using the
equivalence scales for eight different household types as shown in Table 1. We do this
instead of estimating the equivalence scale for every household type separately.
S = (A + K) + , (2)
where S represents the estimated total equivalence scale, and  is an additional scale
parameter. Because we have only eight observations for estimating the parameters of
the equivalence scale function, the estimates are often out of the range implied by the
theory. By introducing additional parameter of  we search for the range of estimates of
 and  satisfying the theoretical prediction. Although  is not identified, it should be
noted that the parameter  does not affect the comparison of two households of different
demographic types. The purpose of our study is not to estimate the exact equivalence scale
for a specific practical application (such as a tax policy) but to find a range of reasonable
estimates of  and  that is implied by the data. The estimation procedure is that the values
of  and  are estimated for a fixed value of . Then, we find a range of  that produces
the estimates of  and  between zero and one as indicated in Table 2. In the following
sections, we estimate the effect of a newly born child on household consumption per
equivalence scale for the range of the estimates in Table 2.

3. Statistical methods
In order to estimate the causal effect of fertility on material wellbeing, we apply a match-
ing approach based on the treatment effect literature following the counterfactual model
of causal inference. This approach is based on the intuitively attractive idea of contrast-
ing the outcomes of a treatment group, Y1
, with the outcomes of a `comparable' control
group, Y0
, conditional on a set of characteristics of individuals, X. The outcome in this
study is the household consumption expenditure per equivalence scale in 1997, and the
treatment is defined as the birth of a child between 1993 and 1997. The control variable,
X, includes the observable characteristics of households in 1993. Differences in the out-
comes between the two groups are consequently attributed to the treatment, D. Matching
methods for estimating causal effects have several advantages. First, they make no as-
sumptions about the functional form of the dependence between the outcome of interest
and the control variables. Second, matching ensures that the control variables of interest
in the treatment group are similar to those in the control group and, thus, only similar units
are compared. Third, since fewer parameters are estimated than in a traditional regression
model, matching may be more efficient. This can be especially important if samples are
small.
The matching method is based on the identifying assumption that, conditional on X,
the outcome of the control group Y0
is independent of the treatment D. Using the notation
of Dawid (1979), the assumption of strongly ignorable treatment assignment
Y0

 D | X, (3)
is sufficient to identify the mean effect of treatment on the treated, or ATT (Rosenbaum
and Rubin 1983):
ATT = E(Y1
- Y0
| D = 1) = E(Y1
| D = 1) - E(Y0
| D = 0). (4)
Assumption (3) produces a comparison group that resembles the control group of an ex-
periment in one key aspect: conditional on X, the distribution of Y0
given D = 1 is the
same as the distribution of Y0
given D = 0:
E(Y0
| X, D = 1) = E(Y0
| X, D = 0) = E(Y0
| X). (5)

In general, the households that experience the event of childbearing are likely to be differ-
ent from those who do not in many respects. Examples include educational achievement,
working status, preference for having children, and so forth. Thus a simple tabulation
of the treatment and controls will most likely yield biased estimates of the treatment ef-
fect. In other words, these differences are going to affect the total household consumption
expenditure, which induces a bias of the estimate due to selection. By matching the
households based on a set of control variables, ATT in equation (4) corrects for the selec-
tion bias due to the correlation between childbearing and the observable characteristics
of households (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). Strictly speaking, the matching method
does not resolve any selection bias due to the unobservable characteristics (Heckman and
Robb 1985). However, in so far as the observed variables used for matching also cap-
ture outcomes due to unobserved heterogeneity, this bias will be reduced. Hence, the set
of variables included in the matching should be as extensive as possible, including both
exogenous and endogenous variables. To further refine our estimates, we consider the
difference between outcome variables in 1993 and 1997.
ATT = E((Y1,1997
- Y1,1993
) - (Y0,1997
- Y0,1993
) | D = 1)
= E(Y1,1997
- Y1,1993
| D = 1) - E(Y0,1997
- Y0,1993
| D = 0)
= E(Y1
| D = 1) - E(Y0
| D = 0). (6)
The ATT in equation (6) is the so-called difference-in-difference estimator, and corrects
for the selection bias due to the fixed component of unobservable characteristics. That
is, if the effect of the unobservable characteristics of a household such as the preference
for childbearing on individual household consumption is present in both 1993 and 1997
and if its magnitudes are the same, it is removed in equation (6) as the change in the
outcome variable is considered. It should be noted that the identifying assumption for
ATT in equation (6) has a weaker form implying that the change in the outcome of the
control group is independent of the treatment.
Y0,1997
- Y0,1993

 D | X. (7)
However, our analysis is still prone to selection bias due to the time-varying component
of the unobservable characteristics.
For estimating the mean effect of treatment on the treated, many matching estimators
have been proposed that exploit assumption (7) for alternative matching methods. For
all matching methods, the average treatment effect for the treated in equation (6) can be
written as (Heckman et al. 1998):

 , (8)
that is, the average (weighted by wi
) of the differences between the events, Y1i
, of the
treatment group T and the events, Y0j
, of the control group C weighted by Wi,j
. The
different matching algorithms differ in the construction of the comparison weights, Wi,j
.
Traditional matching methods pair the non-treated with the treated persons that are
`close' in terms of X using different metrics, e.g. caliper matching of different widths,
Mahlanobis distance matching, or kernel-based matching. In practice (i.e. with samples
of typical size) it is often difficult to match on high dimensional X. Instead it is easier
to do the matching based on individuals' probability of treatment, or in other words the
propensity score (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). We define P(X) as the propensity score
with P(X) = P(T = 1 | X). If the balancing property
D 
 X | P(X) (9)
is satisfied, i.e. X and D are independent conditional on P(X), observations with the
same propensity score must have the same distribution of observable and unobservable
characteristics independent of treatment status. In other words, for a given propensity
score, exposure to treatment is random. A theorem of Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)
demonstrates that if assumption (7) is satisfied, then
Y0,1997
- Y0,1993

 D | P(X), (10)
provided 0 < P(X) < 1, so that there is a positive probability that the events D = 1
and D = 0 occur. This insight shows that matching can be performed on P(X) alone,
provided that the balancing property (9) holds.
Propensity scores are implemented in the matching techniques by defining the close-
ness of propensity scores and the control variable X in different ways. Since estimates
are sometimes sensitive to the choice of matching technique, we implement several ap-
proaches. In particular we apply nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, kernel
matching, and stratification matching based on the propensity score (Becker and Ichino
2002). With nearest neighbor matching, each member of the treatment group is matched
to a non-treated unit using the closest propensity score. With radius matching, the treated
units are only matched with non-treated units within a pre-specified range around their
propensity scores. With kernel matching, the propensity score of each treated unit is
matched with the kernel-weighted average outcome of all non-treated units.

Finally, with stratification matching, the range of variation of the propensity score is di-
vided into intervals such that within each interval, treated and control units have on aver-
age the same propensity score.
4. Institutional background and data
4.1 Background and data description
In many developing countries we observe that fertility declines often come along with re-
ductions in poverty. Indonesia is perhaps the most striking example of this pattern. Over
the last four decades, Indonesia has experienced unprecedented economic growth together
with a dramatic fertility decline. Table 3 shows that the real GDP per person increased by
more than three times over the period 1970 to 1995, and total fertility rate fell by around
50% over the same period. This dynamic nature of the socio-economic change combined
with a large population and its vast geographical diversity has attracted considerable inter-
est among demographers and policymakers alike. We focus on the period between 1993
and 1997, which is at the end of the fertility transition and before the Asian Financial
Crisis.10

10 The field work of the second wave of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS2) was conducted between
August and December of 1997. Although there had been a modest increase in the exchange rate for that period,
the real financial crisis took off in January 1998. Frankenberg et al. (2003) also point out that the growth rate of
prices and wages in Indonesia started to jump in January 1998. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that
the IFLS2 was not severely affected by the financial crisis.

Our study is based on data from the Indonesian Family and Life Survey (IFLS). The
IFLS consists of three waves in total, IFLS1 conducted in 1993/94, IFLS2 and IFLS2+ in
1997 and 1998, and IFLS3 in 2000. In 1997, the Indonesian economy was hit by the Asian
financial crisis. The second wave of the IFLS was conducted shortly before the event. We
do not use any of the waves after 1997 in order to prevent estimates from being driven
by the financial crisis. The IFLS is of exceptional quality and is ideal for the purpose
of constructing a quasi-experiment of the type implemented here, as the survey contains
extensive questionnaires on a range of aspects of household economy covering a period of
steady economic growth. The survey has been conducted by RAND Corporation in col-
laboration with UCLA and Lembaga Demografi, University of Indonesia (Frankenberg
and Karoly 1995). The sample is representative of about 83% of the Indonesian popula-
tion and contains over 30,000 individuals living in 13 of the 27 provinces in the country.
IFLS1 has 7,224 households, and subsequent waves targeted all the split-off households
as well as all the original households previously interviewed. The response rate for the
IFLS2 was 94 percent of the original sample (Frankenberg and Thomas 2000). The survey
contains a wealth of information collected at the individual and household levels, includ-
ing multiple indicators of economic well-being such as consumption, income, and assets.
It also includes information on education, migration, labor market outcomes, marriage,
fertility, contraceptive use and health. Information on relationship among co-residents
and non-co-resident family members and inter-generational mobility are included as well.
Another outstanding feature of the IFLS is the quality of information provided at the com-
munity level. The panel has information concerning the physical and social environment,
infrastructure, employment opportunities, food prices, access to health and educational
facilities, and the quality and prices of services available at those facilities.
4.2 Control variables
Our unit of analysis is the household. 6,742 households were interviewed in both waves.
After dropping observations that have missing values for relevant variables, the final sam-
ple consists of 4,852 households. Table 4 presents summary statistics of household char-
acteristics. The proportion of households with urban residence is 44% in 1993 and re-
mains almost the same in 1997. Average household size is 4.57 in 1993 and it decreases
by 0.1 in 1997. The proportion of children within households decreases from 0.31 to
0.28 between waves. The average number of newly born children between waves is 0.31.
Put differently, 27% of the households experienced at least one live birth. Only 15% of
households are headed by a female, and the head's average age is 45.6 years in 1993 and
48.4 in 1997. Islam is the dominant religion, as 87% of household heads are Muslim. The
proportion of household heads who worked in the previous year increases from 82% to
86% between waves.
http://www.demographic-research.org 635
Kim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?
The educational attainment of household heads increases from 4.7 years in 1993 to 5.3
years in 1997. The proportion of households with new household heads in the second
wave is four percent. General educational attainment of household members increases
between 1993 and 1997 as can be seen in Table 2. The average number of adult men
who worked in the previous year increases by 0.05, but that for adult women decreases
by 0.07 in the second wave. The prevalence of child labor is low in the sample, which
is partly due to the fact that the question of whether an individual worked in the past
year does not capture part-time workers or unpaid family workers. The proportion of
households with at least one farmer decreases from 42% in 1993 to 37% in 1997. Real
monthly expenditure per person is 39,106 Rupiah in 1993 (in 1986 Rupiah), and it slightly
decreases to 38,808 in 1997 (in 1986 Rupiah).11 The expenditure share of food is 61% in
1993, and it increases to 67% in 1997.

5. Household consumption expenditure and fertility
This section presents our estimates of the effect of a new born child on household con-
sumption using the average treatment effect model. The estimation is conducted in two
stages. The first stage involves estimating the probability of receiving the treatment, in
this case, having a child born between two waves is estimated. In the second stage, the
average treatment effect is estimated by comparing households with and without the treat-
ment that have similar propensity scores.
Since the main purpose for probit estimation is to construct a set of variables that can
be used as a basis for matching households, the specification includes an extensive set of
variables representing a household's demographic characteristics, educational attainment
and working status including the head's characteristics. However, there still remains an
issue of unobservable characteristics such as cultural norms that might affect female la-
bor force participation and fertility. The identifying assumption for the matching method
is that the treatment (i.e. to have a newborn child between 1993 and 1997) is indepen-
dent of the characteristics observed in 1993 including female working status and female
education. This assumption is not testable, and it is true that in the presence of unobserv-
able characteristics such as cultural norms, two households identical with respect of all
the variables except the treatment assignment may be different in a way unobserved by a
statistician. Therefore, we try to minimize the bias in matching households by including
as many variables as possible, including endogenous variables, and by including quadratic
terms and interaction terms of those variables.
Table 5 presents the results of estimating a probit model for having a child between
1993 and 1997 with a set of variables satisfying the balancing property. Among the de-
mographic variables, the age of previous children is an important determinant in addition
to the number of previous children to explain a further childbearing. The households that
have more children under five face a higher likelihood of a new birth as the household
head ages. When there are more children aged 10 to 14, a household is less likely to
experience a birth and the tendency is mitigated as the number of children of 10 to 14
increases. When more generations live together, a household has higher chance of having
a birth.
The household head's characteristics turn out to be an important predictor for new
childbearing. As a household head becomes older, a household is more likely to have
a newly born child, and this tendency becomes stronger as the head gets older. Muslim
households are associated with a higher chance of having a birth, whereas those heads
who worked in the previous year are associated with a lower chance. The educational
level of household head is negatively correlated with childbearing only when the head is
female.

Kim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?
Among a set of variables representing educational attainment of household members
only the number of women with more than primary education exhibits a significant as-
sociation with having a child. The fact that higher female education is correlated with
childbearing suggests that female education reflects higher income in the context of In-
donesia.
Regarding the working status of household members, the only significant variable is
the number of men working, which is positively associated with a new birth. This again
suggests an income effect where higher labor income leads to more children.12
Table 6 presents the effect of a newly born child on expenditure in a household using
the matching method described in Section 4 for the whole sample. The outcome is the
difference in the household real monthly expenditure per equivalence scale.13 A child
is defined as a household member of age below fifteen. When the expenditure per per-
son is used as a measure of individual household income, as in the first column, a newly
born child has a significant negative impact on expenditure per person. Using the nearest
neighbor matching method, the households with a new born child between the two waves
experienced a decrease in consumption per person by 7,600 Rupiah, or 20 percent of con-
sumption per person in 1997. This implies a substantial impact of fertility on household
economy. Other matching methods produce similar results in terms of magnitude.
When a child is counted as half of an adult, as in the second column, the ATT is
significant and negative, and the magnitude is in the range of 4,200 to 4,800 Rupiah. This
is around 40% less than the per-capita reduction in expenditure. Although this result is
expected, the level of change is surprising. The cost of a child is calculated to be 52% of
that of an adult based on the comparison of the baseline household and the household of
two adults and one child in Table 1. Therefore, the assumption that the weight of a child's
consumption is one half is not totally unrealistic. The point is that the effect of a new
born child on the individual household consumption can decrease by 40% when a child
consumes a half of what an adult consumes.
12 Strictly speaking there is no theoretical justification for having the number of adults working rather than the
proportion of them as an explanatory variable. In principle the number and the proportion convey the same
information. However, we are careful in introducing nonlinear variables in the specification because those
variables seem to be hard to interpret for the marginal effects. Moreover, the specifications with nonlinear
variables tend to make the balancing property unsatisfied. Therefore, we stick to the linear specification.
13 If a birth took place near the time of the survey in 1997, then the consumption expenditure might be measured
before the birth (thereby measuring the outcome before the treatment). To address the issue, we conducted the
following analysis dropping from the treatment group the households whose newly born child is measured as
zero years of age in 1997. The qualitative result remains the same as presented in the Table 6.

Next, the role of economy of scale is examined. The third column in Table 6 deals
with a case where the economy of scale parameter is one half with a child consuming as
much as an adult. The ATT is still negative but not significant. The magnitude of the ATT
is in the range of 1,000 to 1,300 Rupiah, which is only around 16% of the reduction in
per-capita expenditure. That is, the effect of new childbearing on individual household
consumption almost disappears when the parameter of economy of scale is one half. Un-
der this assumption, the expenditure of a household with three adults increases by 32%
compared to a household of two adults at the same level of utility.14 The estimated equiv-
alence scale in Table 1 suggests that the expenditure increases by 16% from a household
of two adults to that of three adults. Therefore, the size of one half as a parameter of
economy of scale is reasonable.
14 The calculation is based on the comparison of

2 and

3.
http://www.demographic-research.org 641
Kim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?
When both the relative weight of a child and the economy of scale parameter are set to
be one half as in column (4) of Table 6, the ATT becomes positive but insignificant. The
result is well expected from columns (2) and (3), but it is still surprising that the individual
household consumption can increase even after a new birth under a different equivalence
scale. When the significance of the estimates in Table 6 is considered, the exercise at least
suggests that the negative effect of a new birth on individual household consumption can
disappear for some range of realistic values of the equivalence scale. 15 16
Next we estimate the effect of a child on household consumption applying the es-
timates of the equivalence scale obtained in Table 2. The results are presented in Ta-
ble 7. The first column is the case where expenditure per person is used as a measure of
household consumption. The effects of a newly born child on consumption per estimated
equivalence scale in the other columns are all negative although the estimates in column
(3) and (4) are not precisely estimated. The magnitudes of the ATT are in the range from
20 percent to 65 percent of that estimated when the per-capita expenditure is used as a
measure of consumption. Since the estimates of both equivalence scale parameters in Ta-
ble 2 are between 0.5 and 1, the ATT in column (4) of Table 6 serves as an upper bound
of the effect of a birth on individual household consumption. On the other hand, when
it is used as a measure of individual consumption, the expenditure per person is likely to
exaggerate the effect of a new born child on individual household consumption at least by
35%.
15 Given the huge geographical diversity in Indonesia, one might expect a systematic difference between rural
and urban samples due to the differences in relative prices or in the child care cost. However, it is found that
the patterns of estimates with different equivalence scales in rural and urban samples are similar to that from the
total sample.
16 One observation is notable. The average treatment effect estimated using nearest neighbor matching method
tends to be greater than the other estimates in both sub-samples. Further, the estimates seem to be ranked in the
order of nearest neighbor matching, radius matching, kernel matching, and stratification matching. However, to
our knowledge, no studies are able to verify that there is a systematic difference in the magnitudes of the average
treatment effect from different matching methods.

6. Private expenditure on child and intra-household bargaining
The finding of the previous section has implications on the relationship between fertility
and the expenditure on private-public goods. Our results indicate that fertility affects
household consumption differently depending on the assumption about the economy of
scale and the relative weight of a child consumption to that of an adult (see Table 6).
These findings in turn, imply that the characteristics of household consumption is likely
to affect fertility.17 In particular, the composition of the expenditure on private and public
goods may reflect the price of having a child. For example, the share of private goods
such as children's education in household expenditure can be interpreted as indicating a
17 We owe this section to two anonymous referees, who suggested adding the discussion on fertility, the con-
sumption of public-private goods and the intra-household bargaining.

Kim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?
household's preference for quality of a child. The larger share of educational expenditure
a household has, the less likely it is to give birth. We test this hypothesis using a probit
model as used in Table 5. As a measure of the expenditure on private goods, three vari-
ables are used: share of educational expenditure, educational expenditure per person and
educational expenditure per child.18
The results are displayed in Table 8. The basic specification in column (1) shows
the result similar to that of Table 5. Most variables representing household characteristics
and provinces are abbreviated in order to keep the focus on educational expenditure. Total
household expenditure per capita does not exhibit any significant impact on fertility in the
sample of all the households, whereas a positive income effect is found for the group of
households with any child in column (4).

18 The educational expenditure as a part of the information on consumption expenditure is measured at the
household level, and it is not separated for adults' education and children's. Therefore, both results with the
educational expenditure scaled in terms of per capita and per child are presented below.

Column (2) of Table 8 indicates that a household spending more on education is less
likely to give birth as expected. The implied marginal effect suggests that one percent
change in educational share of expenditure is associated with a quarter percent change in
the probability of giving birth between 1993 and 1997. The absolute level of educational
expenditure per person also has a negative effect on the likelihood of having a new child
as in column (3). Using the educational expenditure per child as a measure of the educa-
tional expenditure generates the similar result, where only households with any child are
considered (column (4)). The changes in probability of giving birth associated with one
percent change in educational expenditure per person and per child are 0.25 percent and
0.23 percent, respectively. Therefore, it may be inferred that those households with more
expenditure on private goods like education are less likely to give birth.
In examining the relationship between fertility and household consumption so far, we
have assumed that a household makes a decision the same way as an individual does.
If a household behaves collectively through a bargaining process among its members,
the specification for equivalence scale needs to be modified accordingly as suggested by
Browning et al. (2006). Therefore, it would be informative to investigate whether the
framework of a unitary household is supported by the same data.
In understanding the relationship between household preference and fertility, the de-
mand for private goods may be determined by household members with different prefer-
ence and bargaining power (Browning and Chiappori 1998). Specifically, the expenditure
on children's education may be determined by the husband and wife's collective decision.
It is a common conjecture that mothers tend to care more about children's education, or
that mothers at least have different preference from fathers. Therefore, we focus on in-
vestigating the differences in preferences of husband and wife with regard to children's
education in the context of Indonesia. Using the first wave of the IFLS, the effect of the
bargaining power on the educational share of expenditure is examined.
One measure of bargaining power suggested in the literature is nonlabor income
(Lundberg et al. 1997; Duflo 2003; Park 2007). In the IFLS, the nonlabor income is
constructed by combining income from pension, scholarship, insurance claim, lottery or
gift from family, friends and charity. One limitation is that the percentage of the house-
holds with positive nonlabor income is relatively small (17% for husband's nonlabor in-
come, 22% for wife's at household level). Another measure indicating bargaining power
is premarital assets (Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003; Park 2007). The IFLS has the infor-
mation on premarital assets, but there is a substantial attrition (48%) due to the availability
of premarital assets and the relevant price indices.
In addition, we consider the share of the current asset as a measure of bargaining
power assuming that the individual shares of current assets are exogenously given. Three
kinds of assets are used: farm business, non-farm business and house. Because the
recorded values of assets are not reliable, the relative ownership of an asset is taken as
http://www.demographic-research.org 645
Kim et al.: Does fertility decrease household consumption?
a measure of bargaining power. That is, the sum of shares of ownership between husband
and wife is set to be one. A husband's share of one asset, for example, farm business
should be interpreted to be valid among households with farm business since it is, in fact,
the interaction term between farm business owner dummy and the husband's share.
As discussed in the literature, we test for unitary versus collective household decision
process by investigating whether the individual resources of husband and wife have the
same effect on educational expenditure. Also we examine whether husband's share of
assets have any impact on the expenditure on education.19
Regarding the dependent variable, there are two sources for educational expenditure
in the IFLS. The first is the information on educational expenditure as a part of the house-
hold consumption expenditure. The educational expenditure for a household includes the
expenditure on adults' education as well as children's education. The second is the ed-
ucational expenditure for a particular child. The IFLS has a special section on children
under age 14, which was conducted for two randomly chosen children per household.
The educational expenditure on a child was collected only for those attending school. We
use both pieces of information. First, the household educational expenditure per person
is used as a measure of educational expenditure with the assumption that the expenditure
on adults' education is negligible. Second, the results using the expenditure on a school
child as a measure of educational expenditure in a sample of children are presented.
The results using the data at the household level are presented in Table 9. According to
column (1), households with non-farm business tend to spend less on education, whereas
households with farm business or house do not exhibit any difference. Husband's share
of three assets does not have any impact on educational spending. Households with larger
total household expenditure per person tend to spend more on education. One percent
increase in per capita household expenditure is associated with 2.5 percent increase in
share of the expenditure on education. This magnitude is roughly consistent in column
(2) and (3). In column (2) the husband's and wife's premarital assets have an impact on
educational spending with different direction, but the result does not reject the hypothesis
that they have the same impacts at the conventional level of significance. Husband's
and wife's nonlabor income does not show any effects significantly different from each
other as in column (3). When the log of educational expenditure per person is used as a
dependent variable in column (4) to (6), the results remain qualitatively the same.
19 Under the null hypothesis that the resources of a husband and a wife have the same effects, the husband's
share should have no effect on educational expenditure.

The results from the child level data are shown in Table 10. In column (1), households
with non-farm business tend to spend more on children's education in contrast to column
(1) in Table 9. The difference is likely to be due to the selection of samples. Households
with other assets do not spend on education any differently. Husband's share of the three
assets do not have any significant effects on children's educational spending. In column
(2) the premarital assets of a husband and a wife do not have any significant impact on
education nor are their effects different from each other. Nonlabor income of a husband
and a wife in column (3) is associated with a larger spending on education, but the result
does not reject the hypothesis that their effects are of the same magnitude.
One limitation of the analysis is that the size of samples vary over the specifications
due to the availability of data. However, data at both household and child level produce
results in favor of a unitary household model. The results are consistent with Park (2007),
who did not find a clear evidence that a parental household bargaining plays an impor-
tant role in the decision of expenditure on children's education using the third wave of
IFLS.20 Therefore, the framework of a unitary household seems to be valid at least in
understanding the relationship between fertility and household consumption.

7. Conclusion
This paper describes the causal effect of fertility on household consumption in Indonesia
at the end of a fertility transition in a unitary household framework. Using the nonpara-
metric propensity score matching method, it is found that a newly-born child leads to a
reduction of consumption by 20 percent within four years, when consumption expendi-
ture per person is used as a measure of household consumption. This effect, however, is
extremely sensitive to the choice of equivalence scale. Using the estimates of equivalence
scale based on the assumption that food share inversely indicates the level of household
welfare, it is shown that the effect of a child on household consumption is still negative
but the magnitude is in the range from 20 to 65 percent of that obtained when per-capita
consumption is used as a measure of household consumption. Hence, the results suggest
that the analysis based on the conventional measure of poverty is likely to exaggerate the
effect of fertility on poverty at least because the equivalence scale is not properly taken
into account (e.g. Mason and Lee 2004).
The prevalence of poverty measure based on consumption per person is mainly due
to its practical convenience and the strong assumptions required for alternative measures.
Our analysis presents a reasonable and practical way of estimating the equivalence scale
and applying it to the question on the relationship between fertility and poverty. The
increasing quality of survey data in recent years enables one to incorporate the equivalence
scale in the poverty analysis in demographic research at least within a certain country.
The sensitivity of the effect of fertility on household consumption with respect to the
equivalence scale generates two theoretical implications. First, it illustrates the impor-
tance of separating public from private consumption. The expenditure on private goods
such as children's education reflects the price of having a child. Second, our analysis pro-
vides an empirical bridge between unitary and collective models of the household. The
results suggest that the expenditure share of private goods can be used to test for a collec-
tive decision making process in a household. Although the data are limited, our finding
is that the demand for children's education does not seem to be affected by the parental
bargaining process.
There are a couple of directions suggested for future research. First, since the choice
of welfare indicator may make a considerable difference in the estimation as Anand and
Harris (1994) suggested, it is worthwhile to extend the analysis in the paper by using other
measures of household welfare including income or body mass index. Secondly, because
poverty is measured as an aggregate variable in a household in this study, it is not clear
how fertility is going to affect total household income. Therefore, estimating the effect of
fertility on the elements of household income, such as the working hours or earnings per
hour of household members in a structural model, will be a fruitful way of investigating
the causal relationship between fertility and household welfare.

Appendix: Estimating Equivalence Scale using Engel method
Calculating the equivalence scale requires an assumption on the measure of welfare. Two
methods of constructing a proxy of welfare are widely used in the literature. The En-
gel method assumes that the food share of expenditure inversely indicates the level of
household welfare. The Rothbarth method assumes that the consumption of adult goods
correctly indicates the level of adults' welfare in a household. With the limitation on
the detail of consumption measure in the IFLS, we take the Engel method in estimating
equivalence scale.
The food share of expenditure is considered as a simple linear function of the house-
hold expenditure per person and the demographic characteristics as in Deaton and Muell-
bauer (1986).

where wf
is the food share of household, x is the total household expenditure, n denotes
the number of household members, nj
is a set of the variables indicating the demographic
structure of a household, and  represents a residual. The results are presented in Table
11. The ordinary least squared (OLS) estimation suggests that ten percent increase in ex-
penditure per person is associated with a decrease of 0.013 in the food share. Controlling
for the expenditure per person, an additional adult or child are associated with a lower
food share, and the magnitude of the change is larger for an adult. Since there exists a
huge geographic diversity in Indonesia, we run the community fixed-effects estimation in
order to control for the variation in prices or infrastructure at the community level. The
results, shown in column (2), are similar to those from the OLS estimation.
With the estimates of the Engel curve, we calculate the equivalence scale by com-
paring two households with different demographic structures (i.e. household composi-
tion). We denote the total expenditure and the demographic characteristics of the baseline
household of two adults by x0
and n0
, respectively. We are interested in the amount
of expenditure, xc
, that would give the same level of food share to a household with a
demographic structure, nc
, as that of the baseline household.
