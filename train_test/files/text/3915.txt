Introduction
Violence against other social, national, ethnic, racial and
religious groups continues to affect many parts of the
world. Such communal riots may produce significant
human rights violations and loss of life, and may even be a
harbinger of more severe political or intergroup conflict
(Horowitz, 2001).
Anumber of scholars, including Brass (1997), Dancygier
(2010), Olzak (1992) and Wilkinson (2004), have conse-
quently provided careful analyses of the determinants of
communal violence. They do so from the "top down", how-
ever, treating riots as events and offering ecological-level
explanations. A newer group of researchers have comple-
mented this research with microlevel examinations of indi-
viduals' motivations for participation in attacks on other
groups (Claassen, 2014; Scacco, 2010).
Despite this accumulation of research on why riots occur
and why people participate, we still have little idea who the
rioters are, and how many they number. There are both the-
oretical and policy reasons why we should want to know
the answers to these questions. Data on numbers might
offer a challenge to policymakers who dismiss rioters as
a tiny criminal minority (see Misago et al., 2010; Sears
and McConahay, 1969), while knowledge of who
riots--the socio-demographic factors that correlate with
participation--would seem to be a prerequisite to under-
standing why riots occur.
This paper uses recent survey data from South Africa to
tackle both these questions: the numbers who take part in
communal violence and the socio-demographic factors that
predict who does. I use a survey of a sample of residents of
a South African township1 that was struck by communal
violence between locals and African immigrants in 2008
(see Misago et al., 2010). Three features of the survey ren-
der it useful for the task of describing riot participants.
Firstly, the survey was conducted in Alexandra, the town-
ship where the 2008 violence began and where it reached its
greatest intensity. Secondly, interviews were conducted with
a representative sample of adult South African residents of
the area, permitting externally valid inferences about who
actually participated in 2008. Thirdly, the participation
questions were asked using a method designed to ensure the
privacy of respondents, and thus the validity of responses.
Who participates in communal violence?
Survey evidence from South Africa

Abstract
Little is known about the thousands of people who take part in communal violence. Existing research is largely based on
interviews, impressionistic accounts and government records of arrestees. In contrast, this paper examines data from a
novel survey of a representative sample of residents of Alexandra, a township in South Africa where a 2008 nation-wide
wave of anti-immigrant riots began. Data on participation in the attacks were collected using a method ensuring the
privacy of responses, thus potentially reducing response bias. In contrast to the conclusions of existing research, which
emphasize the participation of young males, the survey data reveal that a significant number of participants were female
and participants were not particularly young, being 34 years old on average. Participants are more likely to support an
opposition party, attend community policing meetings and have a high-school education.

My results are as follows. With respect to numbers, I
find that 8.5% of adult South African residents of the area
participated in some way in 2008. In contrast to existing
descriptions of participants, my survey data show that a sig-
nificant number of women took part in the 2008 riots in
Alexandra (30% of participants). Moreover, and again in
contrast to existing accounts, participants were not particu-
larly young (median age: 34). Those who participated in
2008 were more likely to support an opposition party and to
have a high-school (versus higher) education, particularly
among the male subsample. Participants, particularly
among the female subsample, also attended more commu-
nity policing meetings, which were the sites where violence
was initially organized (Misago et al., 2010).
Communal riots
Researchers have noted high levels of xenophobia in South
Africa, both in the form of pronounced anti-immigrant atti-
tudes (Mattes et al., 1999) as well as widespread lynchings
of immigrants (Harris, 2004). Such xenophobia is particu-
larly severe in the townships that ring South African cities,
where many black South Africans live, and where many
immigrants from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and further
afield have made their homes. In May of 2008 a wave of
anti-immigrant violence swept these townships, lasting for
three weeks and leaving 62 dead, 670 wounded and 100,000
displaced (see Misago et al., 2010; Steinberg, 2008).
These attacks can be viewed as examples of communal
riots, as they are: (1) a form of collective violence lasting
hours, days or weeks; (2) incidents where violence is perpe-
trated by ordinary people, that is, not regular or irregular mem-
bers of the armed forces; and (3) events in which the targets
are some other social, national, ethnic, racial or religious
group.As this definition suggests, communal riots are more or
less synonymous with "deadly ethnic riots", as described in
Horowitz's (2001) encyclopaedic book of the same name.
A number of major studies--Horowitz's included--have
investigated the causes of communal riots. Scholars have
typically treated riots as events, explaining their occurrence
as an extension of competition, either between groups
(Dancygier, 2010; Olzak, 1992) or group leaders (Brass,
1997; Wilkinson, 2004). The most rigorous study of the 2008
anti-immigrants riots (Misago et al., 2010) echoes this latter
thread in the literature, finding that the attacks were insti-
gated at township community policing meetings, often with
the involvement of the leaders of these informal institutions.
Participation in communal violence:
who and how many?
Although the bulk of the existing scholarly effort has been
expended on explaining why communal riots occur, some
scholars have also turned their attention to the participants
who make up the mobs. Horowitz's (2001) exhaustive
review of secondary sources concludes that participants are
working class and "overwhelmingly male" (258) with ages
ranging "from the teens to the thirties, with the median
toward the low end" (259). Tishkov's (1995) analysis of a
sample of individuals arrested after the 1990 Osh riots in
Kyrgyzstan finds that all but one of the accused were male,
a majority were from 25 to 30 years of age with few older
than 40 and most had completed high school. Historical
research on the European food riots of the 18th and 19th
centuries, in contrast, notes the participation of women,
older men and children (Gailus, 1994; Thompson, 1971).
These conclusions regarding participants in communal
riots--contradictory as they are--are limited by the unrelia-
ble sources of data on which they rest: convenience samples
and impressionistic accounts. Far preferable as a research
method is a public opinion survey of a representative sample
of residents of an affected area, which is the technique I
deploy. Surprisingly, there are only two other such surveys,
as far as I am aware. The first is by Scacco (2010), and is a
probability survey of the riot-prone Nigerian cities of Jos and
Kaduna, conducted in 2008. Although Scacco does not sam-
ple women, based on the assumption that women did not par-
ticipate, she finds that 19% of adult males took part in the
2001 riots. She finds, moreover, that participants tended to
be poorer and active in community policing organizations.
The second is the Los Angeles Riot Study of the neighbour-
hoodsaffectedbythe1965Wattsriots(SearsandMcConahay,
1969).2 The researchers find that that 22% of the residents of
the affected areas took part, 68% of respondents who admit-
ted taking part were under 30, and 62% were male. Indicators
of socio-economic status, however, show little or no relation-
ship with participation.
Thus, in sum, the sparse evidence we have regarding
numbers of participants suggests that they are a minority,
but their absolute number is large. We know even less with
respect to the socio-demographic predictors of participa-
tion: some sources suggest that rioting is carried out by
young men; others note the participation of women and
older people. The data on participation and socio-economic
status is similarly contradictory.
Data and methods
Data on participation in communal riots is best gathered
using a public opinion survey of a probability sample of
residents of an area recently affected by such a riot. In April
and May 2011, I conducted such a survey of a representa-
tive sample of 497 adult South African residents of
Alexandra, where the 2008 violence began and where it
reached its greatest intensity (Misago et al., 2010).
Sampling
There is no reliable list of addresses in townships like
Alexandra, nor are landlines telephones or internet

connections common. To arrive at a representative sample.
I stratified by the major housing types of government flats,
hostels and houses and shacks. Then, using satellite photo-
graphs, I divided each stratum into equal-sized clusters and
randomly selected clusters from within each stratum.
Within each cluster, each interviewer was assigned a direc-
tion in which to walk and used a randomly chosen sampling
interval to select dwellings (houses, shacks, flats or hostel
rooms) for further investigation. The same sampling inter-
val was used to select households from within each dwell-
ing. Finally, a specially constructed random number table
was used to select a respondent from the adult South
African members of the household. Face-to-face interviews
were conducted in or near the respondents' homes in
Alexandra. One call-back was required for non-contact and
no substitutions were permitted. The response rate (AAPOR
#3) is 69.2%.3
Some 8% of the sample (N = 45) were not present in
Alexandra at the time of the 2008 attacks. These respond-
ents were excluded from the analysis that follows, leaving
a final sample size of 452.4
Measuring participation
The outcome of interest is individual participation in the
attacks of 2008. Respondents may be reluctant to disclose
such potentially incriminating information, but researchers
such as Misago et al. (2010) and Steinberg (2008)--who
have asked similar questions of Alexandra residents--have
reported success, suggesting that social desirability biases
may in fact be quite minimal.
Nevertheless, in an effort to reduce response bias as
much as possible, I used a variation of the Gallup secret
ballot technique--first adapted for riot participation by
Scacco (2010)--when asking respondents about their par-
ticipation in the 2008 riots. Five questions were asked:
whether the respondent had (1) joined in one of the protests
that preceded some of the attacks, (2) threatened or intimi-
dated anyone, (3) looted, (4) harmed anyone, or (5)
destroyed any shacks during the attacks of 2008.
Respondents received a small card with five rows of the
letters "A", "B" and "C", and were asked to circle the letter
that corresponded to the correct answer for each question.5
When all five questions had been completed, respondents
were then asked to seal the card in an envelope that had
been provided, ensuring that their responses remained hid-
den from the interviewer.
The survey was conducted three years after the riots.
Although such an interval would render many, if not most
kinds of memories vague and unreliable,Alexandra residents
were very unlikely to have forgotten their participation (or
non-participation) by the time of the survey. The attacks of
2008 are branded in the public imagination in Alexandra.6
Moreover, immediately before gathering the measures of
participation, I asked respondents if they remembered the
attacks. Although there may be some social desirability bias
in answering in the affirmative, it is revealing that not one
respondent claimed to have no knowledge of the attacks.7
Producing estimates from complex survey
samples
Describing participants in communal riots requires making
inferences from a sample to a population. Given that my
sample is complex--featuring both stratification and
clustering--this inference is somewhat complicated. I use
various functions available in the survey library in R
(Lumley, 2010), which (1) adjust estimates by the inverse
of the probability of selection into the sample, (2) post-
stratify the estimates,8 (3) calculate variances taking strati-
fication, clustering and post-stratification into account, (4)
estimate confidence intervals using a beta-binomial distri-
bution, which Korn and Graubard (1998) recommend for
small proportions and (5) combine estimates from the five
multiply-imputed datasets.
Results and discussion
I begin with the results regarding numbers of participants.
Figure 1 displays my estimates of the proportion of the popu-
lation of Alexandra who took part in various ways in the
2008 attacks. In particular, I find that 8.5% of adult South
African residents of Alexandra report some form of partici-
pation in the riots of 2008, with 11.6% of men taking part and
5.3% of women. Moreover, 3.6% of Alexandra residents
took part in one of the more aggressive behaviours: destroy-
ing immigrants' shacks or engaging in physical assault.

Next, I turn to bivariate comparisons of participants
with non-participants across 11 demographic, social and
political factors. Note that while participation is measured
as a recollection of behaviours conducted in 2008, the
other covariates were measured at their 2011 levels.
Although this makes little difference for exogenous factors
such as gender, home language and age, factors such as
party support and meeting attendance are potentially
endogenous to earlier riot participation. Causal interpreta-
tions of the effects of these latter variables may not be
warranted.
Figure 2 displays the bivariate cross-tabulations. Each
plot corresponds with the cross-tabulation of participation
and one of the 11 socio-demographic variables. This explor-
atory analysis reveals that levels of participation in the 2008
anti-immigrant riot in Alexandra vary considerably by
socio-demographic subgroup. Among some subgroups
(such as those who live in hostels, support an opposition
party or attended two or three community meetings in the
last year), more than 15% participated. In other subgroups
(such as being Tswana-speaking, living in a government flat
or being older than 50), few individuals took part.
I then include all the covariates in three logit models of
participation, the first using the whole sample, and the sec-
ond and third utilizing just the male and female subsam-
ples.9 The results are presented in Table 1.
Party support and age emerge as significant correlates of
participation, with gender, meeting attendance and having a
high-school--compared to higher--education significant
at the 90% level. The use of logit coefficients, dummy vari-
able contrasts and quadratic terms (for age) suggest that a
graphical display of predicted probabilities would be useful
for interpreting the results of these regressions (see Gelman
and Pardoe, 2007). Thus, in Figure 3, I plot the predicted
effects of all variables that show a significant effect (at the
90% confidence level) in Table 1. These five plots show the
predicted probabilities of having taken part (y-axis) when
varying each of the five significant covariates (x-axis),
while holding all other variables at their means.
Returning to the regression results, one of the strongest
findings that emerges from this analysis is the relationship
between opposition party support and having participated
in the 2008 riots. This association is even stronger in the
male subsample. The first plot in Figure 3 shows the effect
clearly: Alexandra residents who support the ANC, with all
other variables held constant, are estimated to have about a
7% probability of having taken part. This predicted proba-
bility rises threefold to over 22% for residents who support
an opposition party.
A second finding of note is the effect of age. The quad-
ratic term is negative and significant--both in the whole
sample and the male subsample--indicating a concave

slope. Figure 3 then provides a much clearer picture of how
age is related to the probability of participation. This plot,
the fifth in Figure 3, shows this concave quadratic effect of
age on probability of participation. The respondents most
likely to have participated are those who were around 34
years old in 2008. This is quite different to the angry young
men who are typically regarded as the protagonists of both
protest and communal riots (Horowitz, 2001). Indeed, the
model estimates that respondents who were 20 years old in
2008 had only half the likelihood of taking part in the
attacks of respondents who were 34--5% versus 10%.
Thirdly, I find that the probability of participation in the
2008 riots is associated with attendance at community
policing meetings. This correlation between participation
and meeting attendance is strongest in the female subsam-
ple. Although the meeting attendance survey item asked
respondents to report their attendance in 2011, existing
research suggests that participants in the 2008 riots were
probably drawn from attendees at policing meetings. As
Misago et al. (2010) describe, these meetings were the
organizing venues for the attacks on foreigners.10
The results are also interesting for socio-demographics
that are not significant covariates. In contrast to Scacco
(2010), I find that participation is not a function of poverty,
with socio-economic status showing only a weak and insig-
nificant relationship. In addition, in contrast to previous
qualitative research on the anti-immigrant violence of 2008
(Misago et al., 2010; Nieftagodien, 2012), I find that nei-
ther being a long-term resident of the area nor being Zulu-
speaking is an important correlate of having participated.
Conclusion
This paper presents estimates for two unanswered ques-
tions regarding communal riots: firstly, the question of how
many people participate in such violence; secondly, the
question of who takes part. The evidence is obtained from a
survey of a probability sample of residents from an urban
slum in South Africa where anti-immigrant violence
occurred in 2008. The advantages of this dataset for the
questions at hand are its representative sample and the
measurement of participation using the privacy-enhancing
Gallup secret ballot technique.
There are six main findings. Firstly, like Scacco (2010),
I find that around 9% of local residents of the affected area
took part in the violence of 2008. Secondly and thirdly, in
contrast to the conclusions of existing research (Horowitz,
2001; Scacco, 2010; Tishkov, 1995) regarding the age and
gender of participants, I find that although male partici-
pants predominate, a significant number of women
also join in attacks on another group. Neither were the par-
ticipants especially young, having a median age of 34.

Finally, participants are more likely to attend community
policing meetings, be opposition party supporters and have
a high-school (rather than tertiary) education.
Despite its novelty, this dataset has a number of limita-
tions. Firstly, there is a three-year gap between the riots in
question and the survey fieldwork. Emigrants are also not
sampled. Most importantly, the covariates of participation
are measured contemporaneously to the survey, while par-
ticipation is measured retrospectively, limiting the causal
interpretations of many of the findings presented here. Our
understanding of participants, and thus our understanding
of communal riots, would benefit from a future study that is
designed to overcome such limitations.

Notes
 1. In South Africa, "township" typically refers to a residential
area that was reserved for non-whites under South Africa's
apartheid policy. Although townships may contain shacks
or even entire informal settlements, many also have areas of
formal houses that resemble suburbs in all respects.
 2. Strictly speaking, a protest riot rather than a communal riot
(McPhail, 1994).
 3. Further details on sampling, implementation, question word-
ing and missing data are available in the online supplemen-
tary materials.
4. While I exclude those who immigrated to Alexandra after
2008, I do not collect data on Alexandra residents who emi-
grated after 2008. A comparison of the marginals of the 2005
Alexandra Benchmark Survey and my sample shows, how-
ever, that the ethnic and age distributions of the population
did not appear to change between 2005 and 2011 (results
in online supplementary materials). My 2011 sample found
more unemployed people, but this is likely due to sampling
error, as I explain in the online materials, rather than emigra-
tion after 2008.
5. The response set was as follows: "If you did this and feel
that it was the right thing to do, make a cross on the `A' next
to the number `1' (2, etc.). If you did this and regret it now,
make a cross on the `B' next to the number `1'. If you did
not do this, make a cross on the `C' next to the number `1'".
Responses were recoded as dichotomous; having performed
the behaviour in question received a value of 1, otherwise 0.
 6. Indeed, the English word "xenophobia" has come to denote
the attacks themselves--as in the "the xenophobia of
2008"--rather than the official meaning of the word as an
abstract antipathy to persons and things foreign.
 7. In addition, Scacco (2010) finds many Nigerians who took
part in the riots of 2008, despite conducting her fieldwork
seven years later.
 8. Sampling weights are the product of the inverse of the square
root of household size and the inverse of the sampling inter-
val for each housing type/stratum. The sample is then post-
stratified by age, employment status and first language, using
the method of raking. Population data is obtained from the
2005 Alexandra Benchmark Survey.
9. The outcome variable is coded as 1 if the respondent took
part in any way, 0 otherwise. The results are substantially the
same when participation is treated as an ordered factor. See
the online supplementary materials.
10. Striking video footage of one of these meetings, taken during
the riots, is shown in the short documentary, Affectionately
Known as Alex.
