Introduction
Nigeria's delta region is located in the South­South axis of
the country. The South­South is one of the six regions in the
country. The others are the South­West, South­East, North­
East, North­West, and North­Central. The South­South
comprises eight states, namely, Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa,
Cross Rivers, Delta, Edo, Imo, and Ondo (Figure 1). It is
believed to be Africa's largest delta covering about 7,000 sq.
km (Iwuoha, 2012) and presently holds all of the country's
oil and gas resources. The region is the economic base of the
country, and the oil and gas sector, the most attractive sector
of the Nigerian economy (United Nations Development
Program [UNDP], 2006).
The Niger Delta has been plagued by conflicts and vio-
lence as a result of the large deposit of crude oil in the region.
Competition for resources is a major cause of conflict in
every society, and the competition over the nation's "black
gold" has led to protracted conflict in the region. The causes
of the conflict can be directly traced to environmental chal-
lenges experienced by communities in the region. David-
West (2001) in Iwuoha (2012) states that "most of [sic]
environmental pollution of the Niger Delta regions are con-
sequences related to the oil exploration activities of multi-
national oil companies in the area." These activities have
destroyed the ecological balance in the region (Kuku, 2012),
leading to widespread poverty. The attitude of international
oil companies (IOCs) and successive governments at the
center to the plight of the people also aggravated the situa-
tion and led to what has been termed the "struggle" by many
people in the Niger Delta. The "struggle" emanated as a
result of the people's displeasure against perceived injustices
and their exploitation by oil companies in the region. These
injustices included non-provision of amenities, non-provi-
sion of employment opportunities, and the refusal or delay in
the payment of compensation to communities. The struggle
later on expanded to include the desire for the creation of a
distinct region with a political and administrative structure
for the Niger Delta (Isumonah, 2003; Kuku, 2012; Ogbogbo,
2005), as well as a greater share of the federation's revenue
than was hitherto allocated to them. The struggle involved
confrontation with multi-national oil companies and the fed-
eral government. Strategies adopted by the people in the
course of this "struggle" included dialogue, disagreements,
violence, civil unrest, militancy, insurgency, opportunistic

Nigeria's Amnesty Program: The Role of
Empowerment in Achieving Peace and
Development in Post-Conflict Niger Delta
Iyabobola O. Ajibola1
Abstract
This article investigates the role of the amnesty program in sustaining peace and development in post-conflict Niger Delta.
The amnesty program introduced a number of strategies including educational and vocational skills training of ex-militants as
alternatives to violence and militancy in the region. The introduction of education and vocational skills training to ex-militants
is an innovative approach to transforming one of the major stakeholders in the conflict--youths. Youths had hitherto been
majorly associated with violence and criminality in the region. These approaches have achieved some level of successes as
violence and militancy have greatly reduced in the region. However, there are challenges that need to be addressed before
the program can be regarded as fully successful. Employment opportunities must be provided for ex-militants after their
training, and combatants who have not been accommodated by the program should be catered for, to prevent a return to
violence and militancy. With this, ex-militants will become change agents that will spur peace and development in Nigeria's
post-conflict Niger Delta.

criminality, kidnapping, speculation, and misinformation, as
well as blockade of main access to site, stoppage of dredging
activity, rallies, picketing of offending oil companies,
obstruction of rig from entering into location site, stoppage
of location presentation, obstruction of pipeline construction,
and obstruction of de-oiling exercise (Kuku, 2012; Saale,
1991).
Niger Delta youths have been in the forefront of the strug-
gle since the first revolt spearheaded by Isaac Adaka Boro
and Chief Owonaro in 1966. The Isaac Adaka Boro group in
1966 attacked the facilities of Shell-British Petroleum and
government, and ordered the closure of schools, customary
courts, and other institutions. It also canceled all agreements
relating to crude oil exploration and production in the Niger
Delta (Ogbogbo, 2005). Since that first revolt, other pressure
groups have sprung up. They include Movement for the
Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Ijaw National
Congress (INC), and Movement for the Emancipation of the
Niger Delta (MEND), as well as Chikoko Movement among
others (Kuku, 2012). These groups spearheaded coordinated
attacks on oil installations in the Niger Delta and sabotaged
the activities of multi-national oil companies in the region.
The Ogoni, under the aegis of the MOSOP, for instance,
effectively halted the activities of oil companies in the 1980s
till the grievances of the people were addressed. MOSOP
was also able to mobilize communities in its fight against oil
companies, and it can be said that it was responsible for
engendering community activism in the struggle.
These struggles spanned over three decades and different
strategies. Strategies adopted included dialogue, litigation,
protest, and recourse to violence (Ogbogbo, 2005). The last
two approaches were responsible for the high rate of insecu-
rity in the region.
By the time the country returned to democratic gover-
nance in 1999, youth and community restiveness in the Niger
Delta had reached an all-time high. Different governments at
the center made efforts aimed at combating the crisis in the
Niger Delta, but these did not yield positive results. This was
probably because the people of the delta did not trust govern-
ment. Kuku (2012) writes, "Since independence, the people
of the Niger Delta have become used to the military being
deployed against them by successive military regimes." This
mistrust was extended to civilian governments, especially
the Obasanjo regime. His government was accused of using
violence and counter violence (force and military action) to
address the situation in the Niger Delta (Isumonah, 2003). In
2003, the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), headed by
President Olusegun Obasanjo, set up the Joint Task Force
(JTF) in the Niger Delta, "to safeguard oil production, secure
oil installations, crush community protest and deal with any
activities that threaten the activities of the oil companies or
personnel within the oil industry" (Kuku, 2012). Also in
1999, President Olusegun Obasanjo ordered the leveling of
Odi, a riverine community in Bayelsa state, by military per-
sonnel. It was estimated that about 2,000 people died in that
military action (Human Rights Watch, 2002).
Militant groups in the delta, led by Asari Dokubo of the
Niger Delta Volunteer Force (NDVF) and Ateke Tom of the
Niger Delta Vigilantes, retaliated with violence. In 2004,
Asari Dokubo declared an all-out oil war against the Nigerian
state and oil companies operating in the region. He was
arrested in 2005 and charged with treason (Kuku, 2012).
This was the state of things in the Niger Delta till Umar Musa
Yar'Adua came into office as president in May 2007.
On assumption of office, late President Umaru Musa
Yar'Adua realized that youths were the perpetrators of violence
and militancy in the region, and that there was, therefore, a
need to address the problem of militancy in the Niger Delta.
His government identified that many of these militants were
"able-bodied youths whose energies could be harnessed for the
development of the Niger Delta and nation at large" (Kuku,
2012). He therefore set up mechanism to tackle the problem of
insecurity and youth restiveness in the region. That mechanism
is the amnesty program, which was set up on June 25, 2009.
The amnesty program is made up of four components,
namely, the environmental, petroleum, infrastructural, and
Demobilization, Disarmament, and Reintegration (DDR)
components. The DDR component has direct bearing on the
successful rehabilitation of armed youths in the region. DDR
refers to "the process of demilitarizing official and unofficial
armed groups by controlling and reducing the possession of
arms, by disbanding non-state armed groups and rightsizing
state security services and by assisting former combatants to
reintegrate into civilian life" (Ball & van de Goor, 2006). It is
used to consolidate peace and to promote stability within con-
flict-affected communities. The DDR is a proven instrument
of conflict resolution and peacebuilding, but it cannot and
should not be substituted for peace enforcement activities.

Ajibola 3
The Niger Delta DDR component of the amnesty program
according to Okonofua (2013), though, might not achieve
the desired results, which stakeholders expect or desire
because it failed to address the causes of the conflict. In other
words, Okonofua (2013) is insinuating that the DDR process
might not produce the desired stability and consolidation of
peace in Nigeria's delta region because fundamental issues
that gave rise to the militarization of youths in the region
were not addressed in the amnesty document.
The DDR component of the amnesty program is an inte-
gral part of the intervention. The amnesty program was
designed and established to tackle the problem of insecurity
and youth restiveness in the Niger Delta, and by implication,
to restore peace and stability to the region.
In light of the motive for establishing the amnesty pro-
gram by the Federal Government of Nigeria, this article
investigates whether the amnesty program can ensure the
successful reintegration of ex-militants back into their soci-
ety, as well as, whether and how the empowerment process
of ex-militants can stimulate peace and development in post-
conflict Niger Delta.
Theoretical Underpinnings
Conflicts caused by competition for oil and petroleum prod-
ucts, unjust exploitation of resources, environmental degra-
dation, and violence all have their roots in the quest to control
resources, thus engendering poverty, inequality, and injus-
tice. The Niger Delta conflict is a clear example of conflict,
which emanated from struggles over oil and the unjust and
exploitative tendencies of both state and non-state players in
the oil industry in Nigeria, resulting in widespread poverty,
environmental degradation, violence, and militancy.
The causes of violence and militancy in the Niger Delta
can be attributed to triangulation (Okonofua, 2013).
Triangulation can be used to explain the reasons for the
involvement of youths in violence and militancy in the
region. It occurs in family studies "when two people in a
family bring in a third party to dissolve stress, anxiety or ten-
sion that exists between them" (Charles, 2001, in Okonofua,
2013). It is a technique and process used for
transforming a 2-person, 2-group or person--group conflict into
a positive "friend" interaction and relationship by identifying a
3rd element in the interaction that can serve as a "target" or
focus toward which all negative feelings or expectations can be
shifted. (Moffa, 2014)
Triangulation originated from the study of dysfunctional
family setups, but can also be applicable to the study of
behavior in other setups such as workplace and conflict
situations.
Applying triangulation to the Niger Delta conflict sug-
gests the involvement of more powerful third-party stake-
holders in the conflict. This suggests that the youths were
pawns of these stakeholders who initially used them to pros-
ecute their political ambitions. Okonofua (2013) states that
these youths who were recruited from the creeks were used
as paid political supporters at political events.
Triangulation is also important to the conflict because it
helps to explain how dysfunctional family systems contrib-
uted to the upsurge in violence and militancy in the region.
The activities of IOCs and their workers negatively affected
the host communities and their peoples in different ways. For
instance, it is reported that the traditional roles of women in
the Niger Delta was to sustain their families through farm-
ing, fishing, and trading, all of which have become extremely
difficult on account of oil exploration and exploitation. The
consequence of this is that their economies are affected, and
prostitution became a means of survival for many (Iwuoha,
2012). Iwuoha (2012:25) continues, "The sex industry in
Niger Delta is directly linked to the petroleum industry since
it is petroleum company employees and the employees of
petroleum related service companies that patronize the pros-
titutes." The direct fallout of this sex industry is that there are
a lot of children sired by expatriates in the region, and more
importantly, the rate of abandonment of these children is
very high, thus contributing to the lop-sidedness of the fam-
ily system in the region and giving rise to poverty among the
people.
Youths who often get involved in militancy and violence
include those "who have no parents, youths who have
extremely poor parents (such that parents lose control over
their kids) and uneducated and unemployed youths desperate
for some kind of subsistence" (Okonofua, 2013).
Corroborating this position on parentless and poor youths
and violence and militancy in the Niger Delta is this state-
ment from an ex-commandant, also in Okonofua (2013):
It's easy for some youths to be sucked into the whole militancy
game. Many of these boys fend for themselves. They have no
education . . . They have no rich father or mother or uncle to look
up to. Many of them have no parents.
Other theories also suggest that conflicts in the Niger
Delta are caused by environmental factors. Scholars have
since established that the environment can be a source of
conflict and violence (Homer-Dixon, 1999; Kaplan, 2000;
Klare, 2001). The Niger Delta environment in which IOCs
operate has become a source of conflict because of the activi-
ties of these companies, which have negatively affected the
people. These activities have resulted in economic losses as
well as other health and social challenges and pushed the
people, especially the youths, into resorting to violence and
militancy.
Kaplan (2000) in Okonofua (2013) supporting the above
view states that "eco-demographic pressures have created
numerous emergencies within African states, including pov-
erty and malnourishment, and these challenges have forced
many African societies into acts of violence." The peoples of
4 SAGE Open
the Niger Delta have been forced into acts of violence
because of the unjust exploitation of their environment,
which has affected their sources of livelihood, thus leading to
widespread poverty in the region.
However, although some scholars believe that violence in
the region is a result of the unjust exploitation of the environ-
ment and its consequences on the lives of the people, others
attribute violence in the region to greed (Collier, 2000; Keen,
2005; Reno, 2005). It is believed that most resource-based
conflicts in Africa are caused more by greed than by griev-
ance (Collier & Hoeffler, 2004). They posit that armed con-
flicts are mainly caused by the desire of militants to enrich
themselves rather than any altruistic reasons. Greed in con-
flict is fueled by opportunities available in armed conflict.
These opportunities may be in terms of financing, recruit-
ment, or geography. Of relevance to this article is the issue of
recruitment as an element of greed in armed conflict--this is
in terms of the ability to attract fighting manpower; "some-
thing made easier when there is a high proportion of young
unemployed males in a population, in a setting of endemic
poverty and poor education" (Collier & Hoeffler, 2004: 563-
595). In the Niger Delta, majority of the perpetrators of vio-
lence are able-bodied youths who have no source of income,
are not educated, and have not gone through any form of
skills training.
David Keen (2000) does not support the position of
Collier and Hoeffler (2004) that greed is the major fuel for
armed conflicts, but that both greed and grievance are moti-
vations for armed conflict. He says that that because the two
are powerful incentives, the result is that "greed generates
grievance and rebellion, which in turn further legitimizes
further greed" (Keen, 2000:32). The conflict in Nigeria's
Niger Delta is a continuous cycle of both greed and griev-
ance. The grievance of the people toward IOCs and the
Nigerian state has resulted in the "struggle" being hijacked
by their leaders who exploited it to their own advantage.
The grievances exploited include injustices meted out to the
people and exploitation of host communities by oil companies
operating in the region; anger at the force and military action
used by the Federal Government of Nigeria against the people
of the region; desire for the creation of a distinct region with a
political and administrative structure for the Niger Delta; and
the desire for total control of their resources, with appropriate
tax paid to the federal government (Isumonah, 2003).
In checking restiveness in the communities, the federal
government employed the use of force and deployed security
agencies to restore "peace" in the region. Kuku (2012:119)
states,
In 2003, in an operation titled Operation Restore Hope, the
Federal Government of Nigeria set up a task force, the Joint
Task Force (JTF) in the Niger Delta to safeguard oil production,
secure oil installations, crush community protest and deal with
any activities of the oil companies or personnel within the oil
industry.
This drew the ire of youths in the region who were aggrieved at
the high-handedness of government.
However, despite the fact that the people had legitimate
reasons for their grievances, these factors are closely related
to greed, especially the desire by stakeholders to benefit per-
sonally from new opportunities that open from the "strug-
gle." An ex-combatant says in Okonofua (2013),
Let no one be deceived, it is all about oil. If there is a separation
between political power and oil, a lot of Niger Delta politicians
will not contest elections and there will be no militancy.
Militancy is the child of greedy and corrupt politicians who will
stop at nothing to make money for themselves, their families,
and their friends.
What this suggests is that the militancy in the Niger Delta
region is fueled by corrupt politicians who use the excuse of
environmental degradation and exploitation to incite youths
to further their own ambitions and interests.
Method
The study employed the use of both qualitative and quantita-
tive methods. The use of this mixed-method approach incor-
porating semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDIs) and a
structured questionnaire is the only way to understand the
deeply complex Niger Delta conflict and the amnesty pro-
gram. Six semi-structured IDI sessions were conducted with
ex-militants on the Amnesty Scholarship Program in1 pri-
vately owned Nigerian tertiary institutions to get their views
about the amnesty program as a veritable DDR tool and the
importance of empowerment of the delegates to lasting peace
and development in the delta region.
The structured questionnaire comprised 16 questions,
divided into 2 sections. Section A had three questions that
focused mainly on the gender, age, and educational qualifi-
cation of respondents. These variables are germane to the
study because the amnesty program is basically targeted at
youths in the Niger Delta. The other 13 questions examined
respondents' perception of the amnesty program, the DDR
process, and the importance of empowerment to the success-
ful rehabilitation of ex-militants.
A total of 100 questionnaires were administered to
respondents; out of these, 50 were administered to youths
in the amnesty program in privately owned universities.
The choice of youths in privately owned university was
hinged on the fact that one of the elements of the DDR pro-
gram is educational empowerment for ex-militants, and
majority of them were awarded scholarships to study at pri-
vately owned universities in Nigeria. The remaining 50
questionnaires were administered to youths who are indi-
genes of Niger Delta resident outside the region (in Ibadan).
This category of respondents was chosen because they are
youths of Niger Delta origin who also have a stake in the
Ajibola 5
future stability of the region. It aimed to find out whether
their opinions on the amnesty program, the DDR process,
and the importance of empowerment of youths to peace and
development deviated from the reasons for setting up the
program and the views of the direct beneficiaries, that is,
ex-militants.
Ninety-eight copies of the questionnaire were retrieved,
making it 98% retrieval rate. One copy out of the 98 was
rendered invalid because it was improperly filled. The data
were analyzed using the descriptive statistics and presented
using graphs and diagrams. Thematic analysis was per-
formed on the qualitative data (which includes secondary
open source data), and the results were used to frame the
discussion of findings, becoming the basis for the qualitative
analysis. In other words, the results of the qualitative study
were tested with the quantitative study, which helped to
strengthen the overall findings and conclusions of the study.
Finally, the results of the qualitative and quantitative studies
were combined at the initial stage by the theoretical dis-
course and later by the methodological approach known as
triangulation, which helped to anchor both the findings and
discussion of findings.
Brief Literature Review
Previous Approaches to the Niger Delta Problem
The Nigerian government had tried to address the problems
in the Niger Delta, before the problems escalated to conflict
and violence, prior to the intervention by the Yar'adua gov-
ernment in 2009. The report of the Technical Committee on
the Niger Delta (The Niger Delta Technical Committee
Report [NTDC] Report, 2008) highlights some previous
reports of committees and interventions. Some of these are
enumerated below:

10. 2006--Report of the Presidential Council on the
Social and Economic Development of Coastal States
In 1957, the colonial administration set up a commission
headed by Sir Willink to investigate the developmental chal-
lenges facing the region. The report of the Willink Minorities
Commission made a number of recommendations such as
the following:
·
· Setting up of a Board to attend to the peculiar devel-
opmental needs of the region;
·
· Creating the Niger Delta Development Board (NDDB)
and the Commission recommended the inclusion of a
clause in the Independence Constitution of 1960 that
would establish the NDDB (Kuku, 2012; Ogbogbo,
2005).
In line with the second recommendation, the Balewa
administration set up the NDDB in 1961 (Isumonah, 2003).
In 1992, the Babangida administration set up the Oil
Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission
(OMPADEC) to provide infrastructure for the Niger Delta.
In 2001, former President Olusegun Obasanjo set up a
Security Committee on Oil Producing Areas, chaired by
Lieutenant General Alexander Ogomudia. The committee
recommended short-term, medium-term, and long-term
measures (Kuku, 2012) to attend to the problem:
Short-term measures
·
· An upward review of the 13% derivation fund to a
minimum of 50%
·
· Government should enact laws that would make it
compulsory for manufacturing companies operating
in the delta to produce local content for oil producing
communities
·
· Communities should be made to diversify into agri-
cultural production unique to their environment
·
· Civic centers should be set up to develop sports and
extracurricular activities of youths
·
· Youths should be mobilized for community
development
·
· Indigenes of oil producing communities must be
trained for employment in oil companies
·
· Provision of marine/coastal mass transit transporta-
tion system
·
· The Eastern Obolo (Akwa-Ibom State), Ayetoro
water-way should be dredged
·
· Police stations should be established in oil producing
communities
Medium-term measures
·
· Swamps should be sand-filled to create new towns
·
· Erosion control
6 SAGE Open
·
· Provision of infrastructure such as electricity, water,
roads, and so on
·
· Control of ocean surge of coastal areas
·
· The National Boundary Commission (NBC) should
embark on and complete boundary demarcation to
avoid conflicts
Long-term measures
·
· Repeal all laws that dispossess oil producing areas of
their land
·
· Industrialize the entire Niger Delta area
In 2003, the FGN established a military task force, the
JTF, in the Niger Delta to safeguard oil production, secure oil
installations, crush community protests, and deal with any
activities [sic] that threaten the activities of the oil companies
or personnel within the oil industry (Kuku, 2012).
In 2004, the Niger Delta Regional Development Master
Plan (NDRMP) was also put in place. This master plan was
based on the inputs of stakeholders and experts in 25 sectors
of the region's economy. It aimed to encourage economic
growth, infrastructural development, and the peculiar needs
of communities and environmental preservation for the
developmental transformation of the region (Kuku, 2012).
In 2008, the NTDC was set up by the Yar'adua government.
It was chaired by Ledum Mitee, the leader of the MOSOP. The
recommendations made by the committee are as follows:
·
· An increase of derivation from the present 13% to 25%
and dedication of additional revenues largely to new
infrastructure and sustainable development of the region
·
· Open trial and bail for Henry Okah, a militant under
arrest
·
· Completion of the East­West road from Calabar to
Lagos, with at least one link road per state to the
coastline
·
· Payment of outstanding statutory funds owed to the
NDDC
·
· Disarming process for the youths involved in mili-
tancy through the creation of an enabling environment
and the establishment of a credible DDR process with
confidence building measures put in place
·
· Rehabilitate all existing health care facilities and pro-
vide free medical care for the vulnerable in the society
(persons older than 65 years, children under 5 years,
and pregnant women)
·
· Rehabilitate and equip all existing public primary and
secondary schools and staff them with well-trained
teachers
·
· The FGN should fully resettle all persons displaced
from Bakassi and stop the ongoing dispersion of the
Bakassi people
The recommendations of the NTDC are germane to the
setting up of the amnesty program.
The Amnesty Program
The amnesty program for the Niger Delta derived from the
recommendations of the Presidential Panel on Amnesty and
Disarmament of Militants in the Niger Delta. The panel was
set up on May 5, 2009, to implement the recommendations
made by the NTDC regarding the granting of amnesty to
Niger Delta militants. Subsequently, President Umaru
Yar'adua on June 25, 2009, made a proclamation on the
Amnesty for the Niger Delta militants.
The proclamation relied heavily on powers vested in the
office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as
enshrined in Section 175 of the 1999 constitution:
1. I hereby grant amnesty and unconditional pardon to
all persons who have directly or indirectly partici-
pated in the commission of offenses associated with
militant activities in the Niger Delta.
2. The pardon shall take effect on the surrender and
handing over of all equipment, weapons, arms, and
ammunition, and execution of the renunciation of
militancy forms specified in the schedule hereto, by
the affected persons at the nearest collection center
established for the purpose of government in each of
the Niger Delta states.
3. The unconditional pardon granted pursuant to this
proclamation shall extend to all persons presently
being prosecuted for offenses associated with mili-
tant activities.
4. This proclamation shall cease to have effect from
Sunday, October 4, 2009.
The amnesty program proclamation did not compel any of
the militants to accept the offer of amnesty. The government
signed a contract with only those who voluntarily accepted
the offer; and these were later taken through a proper and
non-forceful DDR process (Udeme, 2013).
The militants were given a 60-day window period to sub-
mit their weapons (i.e., to accept the offer of amnesty). The
60 days were between August 6 and October 4, 2009.
The amnesty program is made up of four components. These
are environmental, petroleum, infrastructural, and the DDR sub-
committees (Akinnaka, 2013). However, the DDR component
has direct bearing on stability and peace in the Niger Delta.
The DDR Process
The DDR process started with the disarmament phase. This
involved the voluntary surrendering of arms by ex-militants.
Boyloaf from Bayelsa State was the first militant leader to
embrace the amnesty program, followed by others, and
"between June 25 and 4 October, 2009, some 20, 192 mili-
tant agitators had accepted the offer of Amnesty and handed
in their firearms and ammunition which were in excess of
20,000 items" (Kuku, 2012:127).
Ajibola 7
The disarming phase was followed by comprehensive pro-
grams such as workshops and incentives aimed at positively
transforming the ex-militants. The Kernigan and non-violent
program that took place in Calabar in 2009 focused on coun-
seling and attitudinal change while agreements were signed at
the Obubra rehabilitation camp. Subsequently, the ex-militants
became known as the amnesty program delegates.
The amnesty agreement reached made allowances for the
delegates to be given a monthly stipend, the opportunity to
live as free citizens, and contest (political participation) and
freedom to travel out of the country if they so wished. They
also have the opportunity to undergo educational or voca-
tional training, depending on their preference, and these were
either within or outside the country.
Results and Discussion of Findings
There have been a number of previous approaches to the
Niger Delta problem, before the current intervention. These
have been highlighted in other sections of this article.
However, a major area in which the amnesty program appears
to be different from these other approaches is the introduc-
tion of educational and skills training (empowerment) for the
amnesty delegates. It is important to note that the Niger Delta
struggle was majorly spearheaded by unemployed youths in
the region.
Youth can be a phase or time when someone is young. It
can also be a young person within a specific age range gener-
ally believed to be between 18 and 35. Youth, according to
the United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), is
a period of transition from the dependence of childhood to the
independenceofadulthoodandawarenessofourinterdependence
as members of a community. A youth is a person between the
age where he/she leaves compulsory education, and the age at
which he/she finds his/her employment (www.unesco.org/new/
en/social-and-human.../youth-definition/ ).
With this description of youth, it shows that youth is actually not
restricted to age.
The involvement of youths in militancy and violence in
the Niger Delta can be traced to powerful stakeholders within
the conflict zone who hid under the guise of the "struggle" to
brainwash young, unemployed youths in the region to fight
for what were regarded as genuine grievances by the youths
but a means of self-enrichment for their leaders. A respon-
dent in Okonofua (2013) said,
Let me tell you, for many years we fought someone else's war.
They gave us the guns and the bombs. They mark the targets and
tell us when to attack . . . They write the messages that we send
to the press to threaten or explain an attack. It is their war that we
were fighting . . . All those years; we fought their war thinking
that we were fighting for ourselves and our children.
It can also be traced to the fact that there are many
unemployed youths in the region who lacked academic and
vocational skills to improve their lives and who, because
they were jobless, were ready to take arms against per-
ceived enemies of their communities--the IOCs and the
Nigerian state.
Themes
The conflict is generally believed to be as a result of griev-
ances of the people. Both greed and grievance are motivators
for armed conflict (Keen, 2000). In this instance, grievance
against the state was a major reason why youths in the region
took to arms. However, although some schools of thought
believe that the conflict came up as a direct consequence of
the peoples'grievances, others say that greed cannot be sepa-
rated from the struggle, especially because it is believed that
most resource-based conflicts in Africa are caused more by
greed than by grievance (Collier & Hoeffler, 2004). Greed in
conflict is fueled by opportunities available in armed con-
flict. And in the instance of the Niger Delta crisis, opportuni-
ties in terms of recruitment and resources abound because of
the allure crude and the availability of able-bodied young
people who are poor and who come from dysfunctional
backgrounds to be used as instruments of violence. Okonofua
(2013) aptly captures it:
It's easy for some youths to be sucked into the whole militancy
game. Many of these boys fend for themselves. They have no
education . . . They have no rich father or mother or uncle to look
up to. Many of them have no parents.
If the empowerment process fails, there will be more
than enough manpower to prosecute violence in the
region. A respondent says, "About 80 percent of the ex-
militants have not been carried along. There are still many
that have not benefited from the program." If these 80%
go back to the creeks, or if they are employed by more
powerful third-party stakeholders in the guise of continu-
ing the "struggle," then there is no hope for peace in the
region.
A recent survey conducted by the researcher with benefi-
ciaries of the amnesty program and young people of Niger
Delta extraction shows that the people believe that the con-
flict is majorly about resource control (62.8%) and develop-
ment (77.6%), and development in this instance includes
environmental security and empowerment (57.4%). The sur-
vey also indicates that (79%) respondents believe that the
amnesty program addressed the agitation of the people of the
region (Figure 2).
Environmental security has also been adduced to be a
major source of conflict and violence (Homer-Dixon, 1999;
Kaplan, 2000 & Klare, 2001) as it can lead to economic,
health, and social challenges as it has been the case for the
people of Niger Delta.

Peace and Development
Opinions are almost divided equally about the amnesty pro-
gram as it is currently implemented being able to sustain
peace and development in post-conflict Niger Delta.
Respondents who believe that it will help achieve sustain-
able peace are 48%, whereas those who do not believe it will
help achieve sustainable peace and development are 46%
(Field Survey: 2014). Reasons given for either stand are
wide and multi-faceted. Respondents believe it will help
achieve sustainable peace basically because of the DDR pro-
cess. The DDR process involved counseling and training
workshops to re-orientate ex-militants, the voluntary sub-
mission of arms by ex-militants, and the withdrawal of these
arms from circulation, provision of monetary incentive,
empowerment programs (education and skills acquisition),
and the provision of job opportunities for ex-militants in the
future.
All these things have led to the positive transformation of
the conflict. As it stands presently, violence has reduced
drastically in the region.
Other respondents who do not share the opinion of the
previous group gave reasons why the amnesty program can-
not spur sustained peace and development in the region as
corruption in the process (respondents claim that the process
had been hijacked by politicians and funds siphoned through
the programme); it is only one component in the program,
that is, the DDR, that is effective; the other components that
address infrastructural development, environmental degra-
dation, and petroleum have not been tackled with as much
seriousness as it had been done with the DDR component. It
is believed that the Niger Delta conflict is not about mili-
tancy in the region but about core developmental issues as it
affects the daily existence of the people. Other reasons given
are that not all the ex-militants benefitted from it, and there
are still about 80% ex-militants who were excluded. What
this portends is that, because the program revolves basically
round the ex-militants, the 80% that have been excluded
might take up arms in the nearest future and at the slightest
excuse.
Educational and Vocational Skills Training
The reason for embarking on educational and vocational
skills training as rehabilitation and socialization strategies in
the amnesty program (Figure 3) is because, according to a
respondent, "it is only through education and skills training
that the Niger Delta people can be truly and fully empow-
ered." With education and skills acquisition, a majority of the
youths will become gainfully employed on graduation, and
they will be able to provide for themselves and their families.
The provision of educational and vocational skills will also
keep Niger Delta youths busy and out of the clutches of pow-
erful third-party stakeholders who normally use them to
prosecute their own political and personal agenda.
Making use of both education and vocational skills acqui-
sition as instruments of rehabilitation and reintegration of
youths is a positive in the DDR process; however, out of the
two strategies, respondents prefer education (55.3%, skills
acquisition--31.9%, both--12.8%) because there is an
almost 70% chance of ex-militants getting good jobs on
graduation (IDI: 2014).
Of the respondents, 44.7% feel that empowerment of ex-
militants will stimulate peace and development in post-con-
flict Niger Delta as indicated in Figure 4 below. This is
because presently, the level of violence in the region and
militancy has decreased as a result of the intervention. The
energies of ex-militants who are the major beneficiaries have
been re-channeled into other avenues. They have been
engaged positively through the empowerment program.
However, it should also be noted that the empowerment
will only work if opportunities for employment and setting
up their own small scale businesses are provided after train-
ing. A respondent shares this view that "provision of jobs for

delegates by the Federal Government . . . that is the only way
that lasting peace will be restored in the Niger Delta."
However, and more importantly, more than half of the
respondents (yes--44.7%, no--53.1%, partially--1.1%, no
response--1.1%) feel that empowerment is not enough to
stimulate peace and development in post-conflict Niger
Delta because the problem in the Niger Delta is multi-dimen-
sional (Figure 4). Other areas pertaining to the development
of the region, which are very fundamental to the problem,
have not been addressed. It is also believed that the program
is selective, in that it catered only to ex-militants rather than
to the generality of youths in the region; environmental chal-
lenges such as gas flaring and improving the lives of the
people in the Niger Delta have not been addressed, and alle-
gations of corruption have dogged the entire amnesty pro-
gram. The only area that the intervention addressed is
militancy, and it did not extend to all the ex-militants in the
region. This is a major potential problem because other ex-
militants who have not benefitted from the program might
once again resort to violence and militancy to attract atten-
tion and get what they want from the federal government and
multi-national oil companies operating in the region. So,
from that perspective, the empowerment of ex-militants is
not enough to stimulate peace and development in post-con-
flict Niger Delta.
Corruption
Corruption has been identified as one of the reasons the
empowerment process of the DDR component might not
work. Of the respondents, 72.4% believe that it will not
work, whereas 29.6% feel that it might work.
The program has been dogged by allegations of corrup-
tion leveled against some top ranking officials in government
and the fact that the amnesty agreement between the govern-
ment and ex-militants was signed by the ex-generals on
behalf of the militants, and a majority of the militants were
not privy to the content or details of the agreement, espe-
cially the part that pertains to the empowerment process does
not indicate transparency in the process. This supports the
position of Collier and Hoeffler (2004) that greed is the moti-
vating factor for armed conflict, especially in the Niger
Delta. These scholars believe that armed conflicts are mainly
caused by the desire of militants to enrich themselves rather
than any altruistic reasons.
Conclusion
This article examined the role of the empowerment process
in the DDR component of the amnesty program on the suc-
cessful reintegration and rehabilitation of ex-militants in the
region. According to Ball and van de Goor (2006), DDR is
"the process of demilitarizing official and unofficial armed
groups by controlling and reducing the possession of arms,
by disbanding non-state armed groups and rightsizing state
security services and by assisting former combatants to rein-
tegrate into civilian life" (www.clingendael.nl/sites/default/
files/20060800_cru_paper_ddr.pdf). In line with this sub-
mission by Ball and van de Goor, the DDR component of the
program was used to disarm, rehabilitate, and reintegrate
militant youths in the region. The inclusion of the empower-
ment of ex-militants in the component has direct bearing on
peace and stability in the region because DDR is used to con-
solidate peace and to promote stability within conflict-
affected communities.
As shown in the findings, youths were the perpetrators of
violence and militancy in the Niger Delta, and their involve-
ment can be traced to the influence of powerful third-party
stakeholders in the region. These powerful stakeholders,
which included politicians and elites, incited youths to take
up arms against IOCs and Nigerian State. Okonofua (2013)
discusses this as triangulation to include the deliberate inser-
tion of youths into stakeholder political and economic
disagreements.
Applying triangulation to the Niger Delta conflict sug-
gests that youths involved in militancy were victims of more
powerful third-party stakeholders who initially used these
youths for political brigandage. Triangulation also helps
explain how dysfunctional family systems in the Niger Delta
contributed to the upsurge in militant activities in the region.
Iwuoha (2012) notes that the activities of oil companies
operating in the region and their staff have negatively
affected the family system in the region. These activities
made a number of women and young girls go into prostitu-
tion. "The sex industry in Niger Delta is directly linked to the
petroleum industry since it is petroleum company employees
and the employees of petroleum related service companies
that patronize the prostitutes" (Iwuoha, 2012:25). The
women and young girls often gave birth to children for expa-
triates, many of whom were abandoned. These children often
grew up to become instruments of terror and violence, and as

Okonofua (2013) says, youths who often get involved in
militancy and violence include those "who have no parents,
youths who have extremely poor parents (such that parents
lose control over their kids) and uneducated and unemployed
youths desperate for some kind of subsistence."
The involvement of youths in militancy can also be traced
to the fact that the region is populated by many unemployed
youths who lack academic and vocational skills to improve
their lives. The DDR component has tried to address this by
providing academic and vocational training opportunities for
vulnerable youths in the region.
Other findings indicate that the DDR component is rela-
tively successful, despite the shortcoming highlighted by
Okonofua (2013) where he states that the "Niger Delta DDR
component of the Amnesty Programme might not achieve
the desired results which stakeholders expect or desire
because it failed to address the causes of the conflict." The
DDR component, however, has been able to address areas of
counseling and training, re-orientate ex-militant, facilitate
the voluntary submission of arms by ex-combatants and the
withdrawal of these arms from circulation, and put an
empowerment process in place. This has spurred the de-
escalation of violence in the region. There are concerns,
however, that the empowerment process might not fully
achieve its objectives if employment opportunities are not
provided for these ex-combatants after their training. If the
empowerment process fails, then youths in the region might
revert to violence and militancy.
There are also concerns that many of the ex-combatants
have not been catered for by the program. A respondent says,
"About 80 percent of the ex-militants have not been carried
along. There are still many that have not benefited from the
program." If these 80% go back to the creeks, or if they are
employed by more powerful third-party stakeholders in the
guise of continuing the "struggle," then there is no hope for
peace in the region.
Respondents also allege that core developmental issues in
the region, which led to the aggravation of conflict, have not
been addressed. Theories underscore the importance of envi-
ronmental factors to resource conflicts (Homer-Dixon, 1999;
Kaplan, 2000; Klare, 2001, in Okonofua, 2013). The activi-
ties of IOCs had negative effects on the delta people and their
communities. Kaplan (2000) in Okonofua (2013) corrobo-
rates this statement when he states, "eco-demographic
pressures have created numerous emergencies withinAfrican
states, including poverty and malnourishment, and these
challenges have forced many African societies into acts of
violence."
Because environmental factors also contributed to mili-
tancy in the region, it is important to nip in the bud issues
pertaining to environmental degradation and underdevelop-
ment in the region that might make youths revert to militancy
and violence.
Based on the above, this article submits that the empower-
ment process of the DDR component has contributed to the
partial successes recorded in the reintegration and rehabilita-
tion of ex-militants in the Niger Delta. However, the reinte-
gration and rehabilitation can only be considered fully
successful if there is no recourse to violence and militancy in
the region. To fully achieve peace and stability in the region,
ex-militants undergoing training must be provided with
opportunities for gainful employment and enabling environ-
ments to apply their acquired vocational skills after training,
the influence of powerful third-party stakeholders in the
region must be whittled down, the impact of political control
on the empowerment activities of ex-militants must be inves-
tigated and addressed, core developmental issues pertaining
to environmental degradation and infrastructural develop-
ment which might make youths return to militancy should, as
a matter of urgency be addressed.
There is still need for further research because of the con-
stantly changing contexts of the conflict. It will be ideal to
investigate the consequences of political control, monetiza-
tion, contracting of pipeline security to ex-militants and
political contestation to the success of the amnesty program,
and by extension, the future peace and stability of the Niger
Delta.
