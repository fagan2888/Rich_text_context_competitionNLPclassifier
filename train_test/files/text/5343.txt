Abstract
Contagious yawning--the urge to yawn when thinking about, listening to, or viewing yawning--is a
well-documented phenomenon in humans and animals. The reduced yawn contagion observed in
the autistic population suggested that it might be empathy related; however, it is unknown whether
such a connection applies to nonclinical populations. We examined influences from both empathy
(i.e., autistic traits) and nonempathy factors (i.e., individuals' perceptual detection sensitivity to
yawning, happy, and angry faces) on 41 nonclinical adults. We induced contagious yawning with a
5-minute video and 20 yawning photo stimuli. In addition, we measured participants' autistic traits
(with the autism-spectrum quotient questionnaire), eye gaze patterns, and their perceptual
thresholds to detect yawning and emotion in human face photos. We found two factors
associated with yawning contagion: (a) those more sensitive to detect yawning, but not other
emotional expressions, displayed more contagious yawning than those less sensitive to yawning
expressions, and (b) female participants exhibited significantly more contagious yawning than male
participants. We did not find an association between autistic trait and contagious yawning. Our
study offers a working hypothesis for future studies, in that perceptual encoding of yawning
interacts with susceptibility to contagious yawning.

Introduction
Contagious yawning, the urge to yawn when thinking about, listening to, or viewing yawning
(Baenninger, 1987), is a well-documented phenomenon observed in human beings, primates
(Anderson, Myowa-Yamakoshi, & Matsuzawa, 2004), and dogs (Harr, Gilbert, & Phillips,
2009). Despite research efforts across more than three decades, the underlying mechanism of

contagious yawning remains unclear. However, an expanding range of hypotheses have been
proposed, including an innate releasing mechanism (Provine, 1986, 1989), respiratory or
circulatory, thermoregulation, the arousal hypothesis, and the social communication view
(for a review, see Guggisberg, Mathis, Schnider, & Hess, 2010). Among them, the most
intriguing hypothesis that has aroused many researchers' interest is the link between empathy
and contagious yawning. For instance, Platek, Critton, Myers, and Gallup (2003) found that
contagious yawning could be understood as a social behavior that involves mental attribution
(i.e., the propensity to understand another's mental state). They found that individuals with
higher susceptibility to contagious yawning are better at recognizing their own faces (i.e., self-
face recognition) and theory of mind tasks that capture one's social understanding.
If contagious yawning is indeed a social behavior, what is its purpose? Guggisberg and
coworkers (2010) attempted to explain the social function of contagious yawning by
proposing yawning as a communication signal that spread to other people for survival
purposes (i.e., the social or communication hypothesis of yawning). While the biological
foundation of yawning might be a change in physiological state (e.g., lung oxygen levels
decrease or brain temperature increases) in response to our environment, they proposed
that the contagious effect of yawning allowed us to communicate with our social group
and promotes behavioral synchronization for facing potential threat. Indeed, this idea is
not entirely novel--in an earlier study, Provine (1989) stated that ``the chain reaction of
contagious yawning synchronizes the physiological as well as behavioral state of the
group'' (p. 213). Similarly, Brothers (1990) introduced the idea that yawning could be a
form of social signaling akin to laughter that is contagious. Although speculative, the
social or communication hypothesis helps explain the social function of contagious
yawning and suggests an account for the relationship between contagious yawning and
social understanding.
Neuroimaging studies have found that brain regions associated with contagious yawning
are also related to social understanding and empathy. Activation in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, which is known for the processing of social cues and recognition of
complex emotional expression (Eslinger & Damasio, 1985; Wager, Phan, Liberzon, &
Taylor, 2003), increased during free viewing of a yawning video but not when the video
stimuli displayed gaping, coughing, or expressionless faces (Nahab, Hattori, Saad, &
Hallet, 2009). Schu
¨ rmann et al. (2005) showed that BOLD response signals in the superior
temporal sulcus, a region known for being involved in facial expression recognition and
empathy (see Narumoto, Okada, Sadato, Fukui, & Yonekura, 2001; Calder & Young,
2005, for a review), increased significantly when participants watched yawning videos, but
not mouth opening videos, and was positively associated with the urge to yawn. Platek,
Mohamed, and Gallup (2005) also revealed that watching yawning videos evoked unique
activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, which play important roles in
theory of mind and social processing (Blakemore, Rees, & Frith, 1998; Fletcher et al., 1995).
These studies together suggest that brain regions involved in social processing may be heavily
involved in contagious yawning.
Clinical reports also suggest that individuals' social understanding may relate to their
susceptibility to contagious yawning. Children aged 7 to 15 years who had been diagnosed
with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)--a range of developmental disorders characterized
by deficits in social interaction--showed reduced contagious yawning compared with
typically developing (TD) individuals when watching a yawning video but not when
watching a smiling video (Senju et al., 2007). Helt, Eigsti, Snyder, and Fein (2010)
matched mental ages between ASD and TD children aged 5 to 12 years and replicated the
finding that children with ASD were significantly less likely than TD children to yawn after
2 i-Perception
being exposed to the experimenter's yawn. In addition, Giganti and Esposito Ziello (2009)
compared the frequency of contagious yawning between ASD children with varied severity
(characterized by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale) and found that children with low
autistic severity elicited more contagious yawning than those with high autistic severity.
The clinical reports signified a possible relationship between autistic characteristics and
susceptibility to contagious yawning (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985; Platek et al.,
2003). Nonetheless, it is unclear whether this connection applies to a nonautistic
population that can be viewed as a continuous spectrum or exists only in the autistic
population.
Previous studies have indicated that even among nonautistic populations, not all
individuals were susceptible to contagious yawning. Only 40% to 60% of the nonautistic
population display contagious yawning in response to a yawn stimulus (Hoogenhout, van der
Straaten, Pileggi, & Malcolm-Smith, 2013; Platek et al., 2003), indicating individual
variability in susceptibility to contagious yawning. However, little is known about factors
that determine such individual differences. To our best knowledge, only one recent study
assessed a comprehensive range of factors in explaining individual variation in susceptibility
to contagious yawning (Bartholomew & Cirulli, 2014). Among all variables (i.e., basic
demographics, empathy, sleep, cognitive performance, testing conditions, and time of day),
age, not empathy, was the only factor that could significantly predict individual variation in
susceptibility to contagious yawning: Older participants yawned less than younger
participants. Yet, age only explained 8% of the variation, which leaves a huge amount of
variation unexplained. Therefore, studies of other variables beyond the commonly studied
social factors (e.g., empathy) are warranted.
Apart from social difficulties, one well-known characteristic of autistic people is their
atypical eye-gazing pattern during face processing, that is, looking at the mouth more than
the eyes (Blair, 2005; Gepner, Gelder, & Schonen, 1996; Golarai, Grill-Spector, & Reiss,
2006). This perceptual distinction was proposed as an alternative account for the notable
social deficits in the ASD population: Their proclivity for not attending to regions containing
the most social information (e.g., eyes) might create a perceptual bottleneck for the
subsequent processing of social interactions (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, & Jolliffe, 1997;
Dawson et al., 2004).
Interestingly, two recent findings indicated that directing attention to the eyes could
effectively restore susceptibility to contagious yawning in autistic individuals to the same
extent as nonautistic individuals. Senju et al. (2009) instructed both participants with and
without autism to fixate on a location where the eyes of face stimuli would appear.
The participants were asked to count the number of female faces while watching video
clips of yawning or control mouth movements. When autistic individuals directed their
attention to the eyes, they displayed equally frequent yawning responses toward yawning
stimuli as did nonautistic individuals. Yet, this study lacked objective measurement (e.g., an
eye tracker) of the actual eye gaze to validate whether the effect was truly from gaze
redirection. With the assistance of an eye tracker, Usui et al. (2013) initiated yawning or
control videos only after participating ASD children had continuously fixated on the eye
region of the actor for 500 ms. In the task, participating children counted the number of
actors wearing glasses, and Usui et al. (2013) replicated the results from Senju et al.'s (2009)
study. The importance of access to the eye region of an inducing stimulus was reported in
nonclinical participants (Provine, 1989). When participants viewed a variety of yawning
stimuli including a complete-face yawn, no-mouth yawn, no-eyes yawn, and a control
stimulus (smile), complete-face yawns evoked significantly more yawners than a control
smiling face (Provine, 1989). The ``no-mouth'' yawn was the only stimuli with deleted
Chan and Tseng 3
facial features that generated as many yawners as the complete-face yawn. Conceivably,
removing facial features of a yawn increases the detection difficulty. This in turn
diminishes the contagion effect of yawning and evokes fewer yawners. This finding also
suggests that the eye region may contain more fundamental information to evoke
contagious yawning than the mouth region.
Other than experimental manipulation to increase detection difficulty by reducing
accessibility of facial parts to viewers, does an individual's inherent detection sensitivity to a
yawning expression preclude his or her susceptibility to contagious yawning? This question is
currently unanswered. Similar to contagious yawning, emotional contagion is well documented
as a highly unconscious and automatic behavior of mimicking others' emotional expression.
Studies have shown that individuals especially susceptible to emotional contagion are those
who can read others' emotional expressions and are sensitive to others' emotions (Doherty,
1997), and that those who mimic others' expressions are better at recognizing others' emotions
(Oberman, Winkielman, & Ramachandran, 2007; Stel & van Knippenberg, 2008). Although
yawning is not considered an emotion and contagious yawning is not understood as an
example of emotional contagion, it is possible that a similar mechanism contributes to the
individual variation of both contagion phenomena.
The contagion effect occurs not only unintentionally in higher level imitation such as
action or emotional contagion but also in lower level nonemotional responses such as
heart rate (Dimascio, Boyd, & Greenblatt, 1957), pupil size (del Valle Loarte & Garcia
Ruiz, 2009; Harrison, Singer, Rotshtein, Dolan, & Critchley, 2006), and temperature
contagion (Cooper et al., 2014). The temperature of a participant's hand has been found
to decrease significantly after s/he observed and rated the perceived temperature of actors
whose hands were immersed in ice-cold water. Since one possible function of yawning is to
lower our body temperature to protect us from critical brain temperature rises, it is possible
that both contagious yawning and temperature contagion are important for temperature
regulation (Gallup & Eldakar, 2013; Gallup & Gallup, 2008). Notably, the link between
sensitivity to temperature contagion and empathy is not clear. A negative correlation
between sensitivity to temperature contagion and the Mehrabian balanced emotional
empathy scale (a 30-item questionnaire, including items such as ``It upsets me to see
someone being mistreated'' rated on a 9-point agree­disagree scale that assess individual's
emotional empathy) was found. However, a positive correlation was found with the empathy
concern subscale of the Davis interpersonal reactivity scale rated on a 5-point scale (7-item
Empathy Concern subscale e.g., ``I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less
fortunate than me''). This suggests that the relationship between individual differences in
empathy and low-level contagion phenomena may not be a simple one.
In this study, we contributed to the little-investigated area of individual differences in
contagious yawning in a nonclinical population by observing individuals' autistic traits,
and perceptual detection sensitivity to yawning expressions. We aimed to investigate the
interplay between one's yawning detection sensitivity and contagious yawning. We first
attempted to extend the clinical findings of the link between autistic traits and contagious
yawning to a nonclinical sample by examining the association between autism-spectrum
quotient (AQ) scores and contagious yawning. Then, we tested the association between
sensitivity to emotional/yawning expressions and contagious yawning. The study of
individuals' susceptibility to contagious yawning could provide insight into psychiatric
disorders such as schizophrenia and autism, as well as general human functioning related
to yawning and the contagion effect. Our hypotheses are as follows:
(1) Individuals with higher autistic tendency will display less contagious yawning.
4 i-Perception
(2) Individuals with higher sensitivity to yawning expressions will display more
contagious yawning.
Methods
Participants
Twenty male and 21 female Cantonese-speaking participants ranging from 19 to 26 years old
(mean ¼ 21.3, SD ¼ 1.89) participated in exchange for course credits. Written informed consent
was obtained from all individual participants. Although there were no exclusion criteria during
the recruitment of participants, in a postexperiment interview, 34 participants (out of 41)
reported that they were not taking any medication at the time of experiment and did not
have any history of psychiatric disorders including autism, which could affect one's
perception and expression of one's own and others' emotions. We could not contact the
remaining seven participants after the experiment.
Stimuli
Video stimuli to induce yawning. We recruited six actors and recorded two 5-minute videos while
they talked about their university lives. In one video, actors yawned 10 times in total with a
gap of approximately 20 seconds in between. Each yawn lasted for 3 to 6 seconds. In the
other control video, actors smiled 10 times with a gap of 20 seconds, and each smile lasted for
2 to 4 seconds.
Photo stimuli to induce yawning. We took screenshots of 20 actors yawning at the maximum
intensity from a video aimed to induce yawning made available to the public by
AsapSCIENCE online (https://youtu.be/AJXX4vF6Zh0). Half of the actors were female.
Due to availability, all actors were Caucasian except for one Asian male.
Perceptual detection sensitivity task. We tested participants' detection thresholds in three
expression categories: happiness, anger, and yawning. We first selected stimuli that would
allow us to generate a complete psychometric function to estimate the thresholds. Therefore,
at one end of the spectrum were the expression that needed to be obviously present (so that
participants would always report positive detection); at the other end of the spectrum were
the expression that needed to be obviously absent (so that participants would never report
detection). Later we describe how the tested images were selected.
Yawning. Because there were no standardized images for yawning available, we first took
screenshots of a total of 29 potential yawning photo stimuli from the same video used for
creating photo stimuli to induce yawning. We took screenshots of four actors in the video who
displayed gradual yawns with various intensities. All photos were then rated twice in an online
questionnaire pilot study by 22 individuals (11 male) on a 5-point rating (1¼ completely
disagree, 5 ¼ completely agree) to answer the question ``The person in the photo is yawning.''
The average rating of each photo ranged from 1.05 (strong disagreement) to 4.50 (strong
agreement), mean¼ 3.19. Based on the average rating for each image, we classified the
photos into four levels of intensity: High (4Æ 0.5), medium (3 Æ 0.5), low (2Æ 0.5), and not
yawning (1 Æ 0.5). For easy reference, we labeled the four conditions with numbers (1¼ not
yawning to 4 ¼ high). We selected three photos at each intensity level (see Figure 1). Six of the
12 photos were of females, and the other six were of males.

Happy. We used FaceGen Modeler (Singular Inversions Inc., 2010), a data-driven statistical
model based on three-dimensional laser-scanned face database (Blanz & Vetter, 1999) for
generated face stimuli. This allowed us to parametrically adjust along multiple dimensions
including age, gender, ethnicity, and emotional expression. We chose to use FaceGen because
it has been validated by human participant rating (Roesch et al., 2011) and has been widely
used in studies related to emotional expression (e.g., Hass, Weston, & Lim, 2016; N'Diaye,
Sander, & Vuilleumier, 2009; Oosterhof & Todoro, 2009). To prepare the final 12 face stimuli
to test participants' sensitivity to detect happy faces, we first generated 36 happy faces from
four identities (two females) with FaceGen Modeler by varying expressiveness at 0%, 12%,
25%, 32%, 50%, 62%, 75%, 87%, and 100%. All faces were centered at 30 years old, and
three ethnicities were selected for diversity (i.e., two European females, one East Asian male,
and one South Asian male). The same group who rated the yawning photos rated these
photos using the same procedure by answering the question ``The person in the photo is

happy.'' The average rating of each photo ranged from 1.17 (strong disagreement) to 4.76
(strong agreement), mean ¼ 3.07. We used the average rating to classify the photos into four
intensity levels based on the following criteria: high (> 4.5), medium (3.5­4.5), low (2.5­3.5),
and not happy (< 2.5). For easy reference, we labeled the four intensities as follows: high ¼ 4,
medium ¼ 3, low ¼ 2, and not happy ¼ 1. The final selection of 12 photos (three in each
intensity, six female) is shown in Figure 2(a).
Angry. An identical procedure was applied to produce angry face stimuli. We first generated
36 angry faces from four new identities (two females) of three ethnicities (i.e., two European
male, one East Asian female, and one South Asian female) using FaceGen Modeler.
The average rating of each photo ranged from 1.25 (strong disagreement) to 4.75 (strong
agreement), mean ¼ 3.09. The final selection of 12 photos (three in each intensity, half female)
is shown in Figure 2(b).
Apparatus and Procedure
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Hong Kong.
All participants were tested individually in a quiet room between 2 and 6 p.m. to avoid the
peak hours of yawning among young adults (Zilli, Giganti, & Uga, 2008). All participants
were informed that the study was on impression formation and they had to select a suitable
drama character candidate from each video that fit the requirements of the character role.
The cover story aimed to disguise the true purpose of this study. All participants were asked
to sign an informed consent form.
Participants first completed the AQ questionnaire (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner,
Martin, & Clubley, 2001) and the Perceived Arousal Scale (PAS; Nicassio, Mendlowitz,
Fussell, & Petras, 1985) followed by 1 minute of music to relax. To induce yawning,
participants watched one 5-minute yawning and one 5-minute control smiling video, in
counterbalanced order before they viewed an additional 20 yawning photos. The 5-minute
video stimuli included neutral expressions of 20 to 23 seconds alternating with 3 to 6 seconds
of yawning or smiling for 10 times in total. Twenty yawning photos were shown after both

yawning and control videos were watched. Each photo appeared for 5 seconds in random
sequence. After viewing all photos, participants rated their urge to yawn on a 5-point scale in
response to the statement ``The photo made me want to yawn'' (1 ¼ completely disagree,
5 ¼ completely agree). A Tobii T120 eye-tracking system was used to present stimuli and
record observers' eye-gazing patterns while a separate hidden webcam recorded the
participants' yawning. The area of interest (AOI) for eye-gazing pattern is the eye and
mouth region of the actor (Figure 3(a) and (b)). At the end, participants were debriefed,
and the purpose of the research was explained in detail. The experimenter informed
participants that their yawning behavior was recorded by a hidden webcam and asked
their permission for later behavioral coding. All participants granted their permission to
the experimenter to use their video in addition to the consent form signed at the beginning
of the experiment.
Observers' detection sensitivity was estimated from their judgment of whether the person
in a photo was yawning or not by pressing a yes or a no key. Similarly, in a separate block,
their sensitivity to anger was obtained by judging whether the person in a photo was angry or
not. The same applied for the sensitivity to happiness. Each expression contained 60 photos
(4 intensities Â 3 identities Â 5 repeats). Each photo was shown for 2 seconds on a 19-in.
ViewSonic G90fB monitor and displayed in random sequence. Three practice trials were
given prior to the real experiment to familiarize participants with the response keys.
Coding of Yawning
The yawning responses of participants were later encoded offline by a coder blind to the video
sequences. The coder would record the presence of yawning when the subject displayed
gaping of the mouth with a long inspiration and short expiration (Usui et al., 2013). Since
inhibition of yawning may occur due to politeness (Provine, 2005), which was also reported
Figure 3. Stimuli marked with areas of interest (eyes and mouth). (a) 5-minute video stimuli alternated
between neutral expression and yawning (10 alternations in total). (b) A yawning photo with the highest
intensity. The eye and mouth regions of actor's yawning were marked as area of interest (AOI; the red
outlines in the figures did not appear in the real experiment).
8 i-Perception
by participants in the pilot study, a hint of yawning with opening of nostril without mouth
opening or eyes closing was also counted as yawning. Participants were also asked to report
their urge to yawn on a 5-point scale after the yawning photo stimuli, to assess their
subjective feelings in addition to their overt behavior. This way of measuring ``yawning
susceptibility'' has also been used in past studies (e.g., Schu
¨ rmann et al., 2005).
Results
Since our count data of contagious yawning are highly skewed and contained an excessive
count of zeros (55%), we examined the association between contagious yawning and other
variables using a Poisson regression (Hoogenhout et al., 2013), which is well suited for this
kind of count data.
To facilitate cross-study comparison, we reported effect size of each statistical test.
Effect size (r) of nonparametric test, including Mann­Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed
Rank test, is calculated with the formula,
r ¼
Z
ffiffiffiffi
N
p
where Z represents z value of the Mann­Whitney U or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, and N
represents sample size. The effect size of Poisson regression is reported in odd ratios (labeled
as eB; e ¼ Exp; B ¼ standardized coefficient).
AQ Score
The AQ score of our participants ranged from 7 to 38 (mean ¼ 18.34, SD ¼ 6.80). In a study
with individuals with ASD, 80% obtained an AQ score higher than 32 (Baron-Cohen et al.,
2001). Although in our sample two participants obtained an AQ score higher than 32 (37 and
38, respectively), neither subject had been diagnosed with ASD.
An independent t test indicated that there was no significant gender difference in total AQ
score, p ¼ .493, Cohen's d ¼ 0.22. We used a nonparametric Mann­Whitney test to examine
gender differences in AQ subscales as the scores in each scale were not normally distributed.
All AQ subscales (i.e., communication, social skills, attention switching, attention to details,
and imagination) had no significant gender differences.
Perceived Arousal Scale
The PAS score indicates the arousal level of participants before starting the experiment
(Anderson, Anderson, & Deuser, 1996; Anderson, Deuser, & DeNeve, 1995). The PAS is a
scale developed to measures participants' overall arousal with a high internal reliability
(Anderson et al., 1995) and has been widely used in studies of hostile or aggressive
behavior (e.g., Anderson, Carnagey, & Eubanks, 2003; Glascock, 2015; Ivory & Kaestle,
2013). Participants rated 24 adjectives on a 5-point scale including 10 adjectives reflecting
high arousal and 14 adjectives reflecting low arousal. A total arousal score is derived by
reverse scoring the low arousal subscale and summing the high arousal subscale score with
the low arousal subscale score. Thus, a higher total score indicates higher arousal. The
possible range of the score is 24 (lowest arousal) to 120 (highest arousal). The PA score of
our participants ranged from 53 to 107 (mean ¼ 82.92, SD ¼ 15.60), which is similar to the
baseline condition average (86.1) in Anderson et al. (1995). The PA score was not associated

with the counts of yawning, Poisson regression: 2(1, N ¼ 40)¼0.00, p ¼ .99, eB ranged from
.99 to 7.22Eþ11, or urge to yawn (Spearman's correlation: rs
¼ À.15, p ¼ .40).
Contagious Behavior
We examined the participants' yawning behavior. Nineteen of the 41 participants (46.3%)
yawned contagiously at least once in either the yawning video or the photo section, which fell
into the range reported in previous studies (i.e., 45%­60%; Hoogenhout et al., 2013; Platek
et al., 2003). The average frequency of contagious yawning obtained in both the yawning
video and photo stimuli was 0.91 (SD ¼ 1.80, max ¼ 10). Of the participants, 45% reported
that the yawning stimuli made them want to yawn (a score of 4 or above on a 5-point scale),
similar to a past study that used the same measure of yawning susceptibility (i.e., 40%;
Nahab et al., 2009). The median score of urge to yawn reported after watching all the
yawning stimuli was 3 out of 5.
One subject was excluded from the analysis as her contagious yawning frequency exceeded
2 SD (i.e., an outlier). Therefore, data of 40 participants were entered into the final analysis.
All statistical analyses were completed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS, 2012).
Yawning-Induction Stimuli Validation
To validate our yawning-induction stimuli, we conducted a nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed
Ranks test to compare the frequency of yawning during the presentation of control versus
yawning stimuli. The frequency of yawning during the presentation of yawning stimuli,
Mdn ¼ 9.50, was significantly higher than during the presentation of control stimuli,
Mdn ¼ 0, Z ¼ À3.85, p < .001, r ¼ À0.61.
Furthermore, a difference in yawning behavior was observed between the two types
of yawning stimuli (i.e., video vs. photo stimuli). A one-sample t test revealed that
the percentage of participants that yawned when watching the photo stimuli (40%)
was significantly higher than that of those who yawned when watching the video
stimuli (12.5%), t ¼ 2.78, p < .01. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test showed that the frequency
of contagious yawning induced by yawning photo stimuli, Mdn ¼ 9.11, was significantly higher
than that of the yawning video stimuli, Mdn ¼ 8.50, Z ¼ À2.59, p ¼ .01, r ¼ À0.41. It is possible
that this was due to the presentation strength (20 consecutive yawns without a time gap in the
photo stimuli and 10 yawns with a 20-s interval in between yawns). The sporadic nature of
yawning in the video stimuli may have caused its decreased effectiveness in provoking
contagious yawning in participants. In addition, some yawning moments in the video were
covered by hands as this was a natural gesture, which might also contribute to possible
reduction when compared with full view of yawning in photo condition.
Table 1 presents a summary of autistic traits, eye-gazing patterns, and sensitivity to
emotional expression.
Detection Sensitivity Measurements
To derive the detection sensitivity of expression, we defined the threshold as the
expressive intensity level at which participants reported detection of an expression half of
the time (i.e., 50%). In other words, a higher intensity of expressiveness indicates a lower
sensitivity. The psychometric curves for detecting yawning, happiness, and anger are shown
in Figure 4.

Gender, Age, and Contagious Yawning
A recent study reported a female advantage of susceptibility to contagious yawning (Norscia,
Demuru, & Palagi, 2016a). Therefore, we examined if there were any gender differences
before analyzing the relationship of AQ and contagious yawning. The Poisson regression
indicated that there was a significant gender difference in yawning frequency, 2(1,
N ¼ 40) ¼ 7.96, p ¼ .005, eB ¼ .27: Females showed more yawning than male. Moreover,
since Bartholomew and Cirulli (2014) found that age is the only variable that contributes
to individual variation of yawning susceptibility, we also examined the relationship between

nonsignificant (Appendix A).
Autistic Traits and Contagious Yawning
We examined the association between autistic traits and contagious yawning using a Poisson
regression (Hoogenhout et al., 2013).
Participants were grouped into one of two categories based on their AQ score: Those
whose AQ score was higher than the median (i.e., 18) and those whose score was lower than
the median. Individuals with higher autistic tendencies (i.e., low AQ score) tended to show
less contagious yawning (0.5 for high AQ and 1.31 for low AQ), but the Poisson regression
shows that AQ is not significantly associated with count of contagious yawning, 2(1,
N ¼ 40) ¼ 2.22, p ¼ .14, eB ¼ 1.8.
Detection Sensitivity and Contagious Yawning
We separated participants into two groups, one with high perceptual detection sensitivity
(i.e., requiring a lower threshold to detect yawning) and one with low perceptual detection
sensitivity to yawning expression based on the median (1.3). We ran a Poisson regression to
test whether detection sensitivity to yawning expression (high vs. low) could predict the count
of contagious yawning. The result indicated that detection sensitivity to yawning expression
(low sensitivity as the reference point) was significantly associated with the count of
contagious yawning, 2(1, N ¼ 40)¼6.34, p ¼ .016, eB ¼ 3.00, suggesting that individuals
with higher detection sensitivity to yawning expression tended to have more counts of
contagious yawning (see Table 2). Even after controlling for gender detection sensitivity
to yawning was still significantly associated with the count of contagious yawning (see
Table 2). We did not find a significant association between count of contagious yawning
and sensitivity to happy expression, 2(1, N ¼ 40)¼1.53, p¼.216, eB ¼ 1.63, and sensitivity to
angry expression 2(1, N ¼ 40)¼.14, p ¼ .71, eB ¼ 1.15.
Eye-Gaze Pattern
Participants' eye-gaze patterns were collected during their observation of yawning stimuli.
Results of 11 participants in the video session and 9 participants in the photo session were

missing because of technical failure. Therefore, the reported results here only included 29 and
31 participants for the video and photo sessions, respectively. This number is below
the average participants in similar eye-tracking studies (N ¼ 47 in Armstrong & Olatunji,
2012; N ¼ 46 in Usui et al., 2013); as such, we provide these observations as a
supplementary result only.
To assess the eye-gaze pattern of the participants, the fixation durations on the AOI
(i.e., eyes and mouth region of the actors) during yawning were recorded, and the eye-
mouth fixation duration ratio was calculated. We separated participants into two groups
(``more at eyes'' and ``less at eyes'') based on the eye-mouth fixation duration ratio median
(1.55 in the video session, 1.32 in the photo session). We examined the relationship between
the eye-gaze tendency and autistic traits. As the data for eye-mouth fixation ratio were not
normally distributed, a nonparametric analysis, the Mann­Whitney test, was applied.
Participants who looked more at the eyes in the video session had significantly lower
autistic tendency than those who looked less at the eyes (U ¼ 70.5, p ¼ .031, r ¼ À.38).1
However, there was no significance difference in the photo session (U ¼ 102.5, p ¼ .34,
r ¼ À.05). We also observed that participants who looked ``more at the eyes'' in the photo
session had significantly higher sensitivity to yawning (i.e., a lower intensity threshold to
detect yawning) than the ``less at eyes'' group (U ¼ 44.5, p ¼ .001, r ¼ À0.55)2 but not in the
video session (U ¼ 87.0, p ¼ .432, r ¼ À.14). We did not find a similar result for happiness
(U ¼ 120.5, p ¼ .794) or anger (U ¼ 83.5, p ¼ .097). The effect sizes are À.05 and À.29,
respectively.
We did not find evidence from our observations that eye-gaze patterns modulated
contagious yawning. The Mann­Whitney test indicated that the urge to yawn of the group
looking ``more at eyes'' was statistically equivalent to the group looking ``less at eyes'' in both
video session, U ¼ 85.5, p ¼ .099, r ¼ À.29 and photo session, U ¼ 93.5, p ¼ .151, r ¼ À05.
Again, when comparing the ``more at eyes'' group with the ``less at eyes'' group, there was
no significant difference for frequency of yawning, 2(1, N ¼ 40)¼.06, p ¼ .81, eB ¼ 1.10.
Discussion
This study revealed that an individual's susceptibility to contagious yawning was associated
with his or her yawning detection sensitivity. More specifically, people with higher perceptual
detection sensitivity to yawning are especially susceptible to contagious yawning. We did not
find that autistic tendencies in this nonclinical population were associated with contagious
yawning. We found an unexpected gender effect: Females displayed more contagious
yawning than males. In summary, gender and yawning detection sensitivity were the two
variables associated with individuals' susceptibility for contagious yawning.
Our hypothesis that perceptual detection sensitivity to yawning expression contributes to
the susceptibility of contagious yawning was supported. Although the underlying mechanism
remained unclear, sensitivity to yawning could be a possible precursor of contagious yawning
and might be facilitated by gazing at the eye region of the inducer. This is in line with the view
from the perceptual perspective that sensitivity to others' expressions (Provine, 1989) and
proclivity to look at the eyes (Senju et al., 2009; Usui et al., 2013) play a role in determining
the individual's susceptibility to contagious yawning. These intriguing findings directed the
study of contagious yawning from exploring a higher level of processing (e.g., empathy) to a
lower level of processing (e.g., eye scanning patterns and perceptual detection sensitivity).
Our findings add to the body of research showing that perceptual detection sensitivity
to facial expression may alter one's social processing. For example, Kuusikko et al. (2009)
used a computer-based emotional recognition test and asked participants with autism to
Chan and Tseng 13
select the correct upper facial basic emotion for each picture. They found that autistic girls
scored lower in recognizing happiness and anger than nonautistic girls. This implies a lower
sensitivity to emotional expressions and that more cues may be required to detect an emotion.
This impedes their social processing and might lead to inappropriate responses in social
interactions. Past studies found that patients with depression also exhibit biased emotion
perception in emotional recognition tasks, in which they demonstrated lower sensitivity than
controls when asked to distinguish happy from neutral expression (Gur et al., 1992;
Mikhailova, Vladimirova, Iznak, Tsusulkovskaya, & Sushko, 1996; Surguladze et al.,
2004). This reduced ability could have a significant impact on a person's social processing,
which in turn could affect their own emotion experiences. While earlier research on
contagious yawning highlighted its social and empathetic components by showing that
poorer social understanding (e.g., in autism, Senju et al., 2007; and schizophrenia, Platek
et al., 2003) depleted one's susceptibility to contagious yawning, here we offered another
possible early perceptual origin. Hence, our finding implied that the later processing of the
social information delivered by a yawn may be precluded by low sensitivity to yawning and
results in a lower susceptibility to contagious yawning.
In addition, our hypothesis that gaze to eye regions enhanced one's perceptual detection
sensitivity to expressions including yawning was partly supported by the positive association
between fixation duration to the eye region and perceptual detection sensitivity to yawning.
This finding is consistent with a study in which eye-gazing patterns of autistic and nonautistic
children were recorded when they viewed morphing facial expressions of six different
emotions and labeled the emotions (Bal et al., 2010). Results showed that looking more at
the eyes was associated with fewer errors in recognition of disgust and surprise and faster
reaction times for recognizing fear but not other emotions. This suggested that attention to
the eye region increased sensitivity to emotion recognition, at least for fear, surprise, and
disgust. Our study extends this finding beyond emotion recognition to the recognition
of yawning.
Our study also reported a female advantage in susceptibility to contagious yawning,
which could originate from several possible sources. First, a female advantage in yawning
susceptibility could come from a female bias in empathetic ability (for a review, see Christov-
Moore et al., 2014), which is known to be related to contagious yawning (Helt et al., 2010;
Nahab et al., 2009; Platek et al., 2005; Schu
¨ rmann et al., 2005; Senju et al., 2007). Females
score higher on self-reported empathy questionnaires than males (Rueckert & Naybar, 2008)
and show stronger neural activation in empathy-related brain regions such as the amygdala
(Schulte-Ru
¨ ther, Markowitsch, Shah, Fink, & Piefke, 2008). However, in our sample, autistic
tendency measured by the AQ did not differ between the two genders. Second, females were
reported to excel in emotion recognition tasks (Hall & Matsumoto, 2004; McClure, 2000;
Montagne, Kessels, Frigerio, de Haan, & Perrett, 2005; Thompson & Voyer, 2014) and were
identified as being better at expressing their own emotions than men. Neuroimaging studies
also find that females, but not males, show increased activation of the right inferior frontal
cortex, which is known for being involved in emotional contagion (Derntl et al., 2010). In our
sampled population, our female participants had marginally significant higher sensitivity
than men in detecting happy faces (p ¼ .063), but not in angry or yawning faces.
Therefore, there was no direct evidence to connect this possibility to our finding. Finally,
females are more sensitive to nonverbal cues in social communication than men
(Hall & Matsumoto, 2004; McClure, 2000; Montagne et al., 2005; Thompson & Voyer,
2014). It is possible that females are more susceptible to contagious yawning than males
due to their higher abilities in understanding others' intention through nonverbal cues like
yawning. We have no direct measurements to test this hypothesis, and this will be a direction
14 i-Perception
for future studies. Norscia and coworkers (2016a) observed the natural occurrence of
contagious yawning among 92 nonstranger dyads and found that female participants
yawned more frequently than men in response to others' yawning. As the understanding
of gender difference in the contagion effect is still at its infancy, future studies are warranted.
There are at least 15 negative reports on gender differences in contagious yawning, and it is
worth noting the differences between them and our study. First, 3 of the 15 studies
investigated children with autism (Helt et al., 2010; Senju et al., 2007, 2009; Usui et al.,
2013), a population known to have a low yawning frequency (Senju et al., 2007). This may
limit any detectable gender effect. Studies with nonclinical populations (e.g., the current
study and Norscia et al., 2016a) might offer a bigger observable range. Moreover, a
sexually immature group like children is not a good sample group for studying gender
differences (Norscia, Demuru, & Palagi, 2016b). Second, 5 of the 15 studies did not
include a baseline condition to control for spontaneous yawning (Bartholomew & Cirulli,
2014; Eldakar et al., 2015; Gallup, Church, Miller, Risko, & Kingstone, 2016; Gallup &
Eldakar, 2011; Massen, Dusc, Eldakar, & Gallup, 2014). A control condition (i.e., in our
case, a smiling video) or a baseline measurement (e.g., spontaneous yawning in Norscia et al.,
2016a) offers an assurance that the recorded yawning was not predominantly spontaneous
yawning, which is known to have no gender difference (Schino & Aureli, 1989), but
contagious yawning which was our central research interest. Lastly, contagious yawning
could be significantly diminished by social presence (Gallup et al., 2016), and females are
more sensitive to social etiquette (Baron-Cohen, O'Riordan, Jones, & Plaisted, 1999). It is
possible that the initial female advantage to yawning susceptibility was counterbalanced by
the higher inhibition of yawning behavior in females. Participants in 4 of the 15 studies were
aware of experimenters' observation of their yawning behavior as they viewed the yawning
photos directly in front of the experimenter (Eldakar et al., 2015; Gallup & Eldakar, 2011;
Gallup & Gallup, 2007; Massen et al., 2014). This makes it possible that the gender difference
was absent due to the pressure to inhibit yawning behavior, especially in females, due to the
social presence of the experimenters. To reduce participants' awareness of having their
yawning behavior observed, our cover story disguised the real study purpose and a hidden
webcam was installed to record their yawning for later analysis. In summary, our control
baseline, cover story, and experimental design may offer a more suitable combination to
observe a female advantage in susceptibility to contagious yawning.
While a previous study reported that age is the only variable contributing to individual
susceptibility to contagious yawning (Bartholomew & Cirulli, 2014), we did not find similar
evidence for older individuals being less susceptible to yawning when they watched yawning
video clips and still images. Our sample had a relatively narrow age range (i.e., 19­26 years
old) compared with Bartholomew and Cirulli's study (i.e., 18­83 years old), hence, it may not
be large enough to reflect similar age effect.
Our finding that participants with more autistic traits have a lower tendency to gaze at eyes
adds to recent reports of an association between autistic traits and eye gazing in nonclinical
populations. Individuals with more autistic traits (assessed using the Broad Autism
Phenotype Questionnaire) tended to look less at the faces of experimenters who asked
participants questions (Vabalas & Freeth, 2016) and had shorter and less frequent
saccades on the face during a face-to-face interaction with the experimenters (Freeth,
Foulsham, & Kingstone, 2013) compared with participants lower in autistic traits. In a
recognition task of artificial faces, Davis et al. (2017) discovered that those who had
higher AQ scores on the AQ-social subscale tended to look less at eye regions of the facial
stimuli. Our results extend the findings to human face photos and videos and indicate that
nonclinical individuals lower in autistic traits tend to gaze more at the eyes. This is
Chan and Tseng 15
supplementary to the well-established report of individuals with autism looking less at the
eyes (Blair, 2005; Gepner et al., 1996; Golarai et al., 2006).
However, we did not find an association between eye-gaze patterns and contagious
yawning. This is possibly because the face studying patterns among the nonclinical
population were consistently concentrated on the key features. The aforementioned studies
revealed the connection with contagious yawning through comparisons between autistic
and nonautistic children (Senju et al., 2009; Usui et al., 2013), which might cover a bigger
range of differences.
There are several possible directions for future studies. Despite our efforts in disguising the
main purpose of our study and minimizing participants' awareness of their own yawning,
some participants still reported that they suppressed their yawning due to social etiquette.
This could potentially affect subjects' yawning frequency in response to the yawning stimuli.
We included a question on the subjective urge to yawn as a supplementary tool for measuring
yawning tendency. In addition, a more objective method, such as myography that measures
muscle activity, could be helpful to measure subjects' yawning tendency, including those that
are suppressed and undetectable to observation. Moreover, it is worth noting that our
yawning stimuli produced a flatter psychometric curve than happy and angry stimuli.
All stimuli selected to construct psychometric curves for the three expressions were based
on the same intensity rating method, so it is unclear what constituted this difference. While
the faces considered as the happiest or angriest in the rating task were always considered as
``YES-presence'' in the detection ask, and the neutral faces are always considered as
``NO-presence'' in the detection ask, such connection was less clear in yawning. One
possibility is that participants have adopted a different criterion in the Yes-No detection
task for yawning from that for happy or angry faces, possibly due to the lack of
experience on yawning presence judgment. It is still an unsolved puzzle to us why this
occurs, and it may be a possible direction for future study. Lastly, a more extensive
screening to exclude participants with clinical conditions and trait-like alexithymia
(the lack of own emotion understanding) could be applied in future studies. Individuals
with psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia could have lower susceptibility
to contagious yawning, and individuals with alexithymia (which could be measured with the
Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Bagby, Parker, & Taylor, 1994; Bird, Press, & Richardson, 2011)
may be limited to report accurately on their urge to yawn. Our postexperiment questionnaire
showed that our participants were not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorders, and it may
be desirable to employ a more extensive pretest screening to rule out factors that could affect
sensitivity and susceptibility to yawning in future studies.
Conclusion
Our study revealed that participants with higher yawning sensitivity (but not emotional
sensitivity) are more susceptible to contagious yawning, which adds to the growing
literature that suggests perceptual deficits, such as atypical eye-gaze patterns, might
contribute to reduced behavioral contagion. In addition, females were found to display
more contagious yawning than males, and the underlying mechanism awaits elucidation
by future studies. These findings have important theoretical implications for
understanding the mechanism of contagious yawning for a nonautistic population. It
will be interesting to see whether similar associations exist in a clinical population such
as people with autism.
In conclusion, our study offers a working hypothesis for future studies to investigate how
the perceptual encoding of yawning interacts with susceptibility to contagious yawning.
