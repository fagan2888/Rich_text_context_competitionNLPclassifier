Context.--Health values (utilities or preferences for health states) are often in-
corporated into clinical decisions and health care policy when issues of quality vs
length of life arise, but little is known about health values of the very old.
Objective.--To assess health values of older hospitalized patients, compare
their values with those of their surrogate decision makers, investigate possible de-
terminantsofhealthvalues,anddeterminewhetherhealthvalueschangeovertime.
Design.--A prospective, longitudinal, multicenter cohort study.
Setting.--Four academic medical centers.
Participants.--Four hundred fourteen hospitalized patients aged 80 years or
older and their surrogate decision makers who were interviewed and understood
the task.
Main Outcome Measures.--Time­trade-off utilities, reflecting preferences for
current health relative to a shorter but healthy life.
Results.--On average, patients equated living 1 year in their current state of
health with living 9.7 months in excellent health (mean [SD] utility, 0.81 [0.28]). Al-
though only 126 patients (30.7%) rated their current quality of life as excellent or
very good, 284 (68.6%) were willing to give up at most 1 month of 12 in exchange
for excellent health (utility 0.92). At the other extreme, 25 (6.0%) were willing to
live 2 weeks or less in excellent health rather than 1 year in their current state of
health (utility 0.04). Patients were willing to trade significantly less time for a
healthy life than their surrogates assumed they would (mean difference, 0.05;
P=.007); 61 surrogates (20.3%) underestimated the patient's time­trade-off score
by 0.25 (3 months of 12) or more. Patients willing to trade less time for better health
were more likely to want resuscitation and other measures to extend life.
Time­trade-offscorecorrelatedonlymodestlywithquality-of-liferating(r=0.28)and
inversely with depression score (r=-0.27), but there were few other clinical or de-
mographic predictors of health values. When patients who survived were asked the
time­trade-off question again at 1 year, they were willing to trade less time for bet-
ter health than at baseline (mean difference, 0.04; P=.04).
Conclusion.--Very old hospitalized patients who could be interviewed were
able, in most cases, to have their health values assessed using the time­trade-off
technique. Most patients were unwilling to trade much time for excellent health, but
preferences varied greatly. Because proxies and multivariable analyses cannot
gauge health values of elderly hospitalized patients accurately, health values of the
very old should be elicited directly from the patient.

LIFE EXPECTANCY has increased
dramatically even among elderly adults
over the past few generations. Cur-
rently, an 80-year-old man can expect to
live 7 years and an 80-year-old woman,
9.1 years.1 But because the elderly dis-
proportionately have both acute and
chronic illnesses, quality of life has as-
sumed increasing importance.
There are 2 approaches to assessing
health-related quality of life. The health
status approach describes functioning
and well-being in 1 or more domains,
such as physical functioning, mental
health, social function, role function,
pain, vitality, and health perception.2-5
Health status has been assessed in the
elderlyforover30years,mostoftenwith
measures of ability to perform activities
ofdailyliving(suchasbathing,dressing,
eating,toileting,andtransferring)6,7 and,
increasingly, with brief, multidimen-
sional surveys.3
Theotherapproachtoassessinghealth-
related quality of life, known as utility,
preference, or value assessment, ascer-
tainsthedesirabilityofastateofhealth.2,8
Onesuchhealthvaluemeasureisthetime
trade-off, which quantifies a person's
preference for quality vs quantity of life.
Healthvaluesareusedinindividualclini-
cal decision making as well as in health
policy formulation.2,5,8,9 In clinical deci-
sion making, they can provide a general
sense of how patients feel about quality
vs quantity of life, and they can be used
in clinical decision analyses to optimize
treatment for an individual.2,10 Ex-
amples of using health values in clinical
practice include helping couples decide
whether to have amniocentesis11 and de-
ciding when a patient with human im-
munodeficiency virus infection should
start zidovudine therapy.12 In addition,
utilityassessmenthasdemonstratedthat
clinical guidelines for management of is-
chemic heart disease may not conform to
preferences of affected patients.13
Utilities are most commonly used as
quality-of-life adjustments to life expec-
tancy in the calculation of quality-ad-
justed life years (QALYs), which, in
turn, are used in clinical decision analy-

cateusingQALYsforsuchpurposes,not

raised ethical concerns over the use of
QALYsinhealthpolicyformulation,one
being that the "old-old" cannot or will
not provide health values and are thus
disenfranchised.
Although much work has been done in
geriatric health status assessment, little
is known about the health values of the
very old. Health value assessment in the
elderly is particularly important because
elderly patients receive fewer invasive
procedures and less resource-intensive
hospitalcarethanyoungerpatients,even
whendifferencesinseverityofillnessand
preferences for life-extending care are
taken into account.18 Whether this differ-
ent approach is with the assent of the pa-
tient or caregivers is not clear. Given the
importance of health values, if in fact
health values cannot be ascertained from
frail elderly patients, it would be impor-
tant to know whether their health care
proxiescouldprovideaccurateestimates
orwhetherhealthvaluescanbepredicted
onthebasisofhealthstatusorothervari-
ables. Another important issue is
whether health values change over time.
METHODS
Study Participants
The Hospitalized Elderly Longitudi-
nal Project (HELP) was a prospective
studyoftheprognoses,preferences,and
decision making of hospitalized patients
aged 80 years or older, their surrogate
decision makers, and their physicians.
The HELP study took place from Janu-
ary1993toNovember1994at4academic
medical centers (HELP was related
closely to a concurrent study, the Study
to Understand Prognoses and Prefer-
ences for Outcomes and Risks of Treat-
mentsproject19).Toqualify,patientshad
to be at least 80 years old and hospital-
ized. Patients were excluded if they did
not speak English; were foreign nation-
als admitted specifically for a medical
procedure; had the acquired immunode-
ficiency syndrome (AIDS); had sus-
tained multiple trauma; were admitted
for hospice care, to the psychiatry ser-
vice, or for an elective operation; were
admitted to a hospital ward after trans-
fer from another hospital; died or were
discharged within 72 hours of hospital-
ization; or were scheduled for discharge
within 72 hours of admission. For most
patients, a surrogate was identified.20
Interviews and Instruments
For each patient, severity of acute ill-
ness was ascertained using the acute
physiologyscore(APS)componentofthe
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation III prognostic scoring sys-
tem.21 Patients who were not intubated,
wereabletocommunicate,andwereable
to pass a cognitive screening test22 were
eligible to be interviewed. Trained inter-
viewers interviewed patients and surro-
gates approximately 4 days and 12
months after study entry.
Thehealthvaluemeasureusedwasthe
time­trade-off score.22-24 Patients and
their surrogates were independently
askedinasystematicfashionwhetherthe
patient would prefer living only 1 year in
the patient's current state of health or
less time in excellent health, until an in-
difference point was ascertained. The
time­trade-off score was then calculated
asthefractionofayearinexcellenthealth
that was equivalent to a year of current
health. For example, if the patient were
indifferent about choosing between liv-
ing 12 months in their current state of
healthorlivingonly9monthsinexcellent
health, their time­trade-off utility would
equal 9 divided by 12 or 0.75. Possible
scoresrangedfrom0.04(equivalenttoin-
difference between 2 weeks in excellent
healthand1yearincurrenthealth)to1.0.
After the respondent completed the
time­trade-off question, the interviewer
judged whether the respondent under-
stood the task; respondents who did not
understand were excluded.
Healthstatusinstrumentsincluded(1)
a global quality-of-life question, in which
the respondent was asked to rate the pa-
tient's quality of life as excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor22; (2) a revised
measure of dependence in activities of
daily living over the previous 2
weeks6,22,25; (3) a revised version of the
Duke Activity Status Index,22,26,27 which
assesses ability to perform strenuous ac-
tivities;(4)ashortenedversionofthePro-
file of Mood States,28,29 which assesses
anxiety and depression; and (5) a mea-
sure of frequency and severity of pain.19
In addition, we asked questions concern-
ing preferences regarding cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation (CPR); willingness to
tolerate each of 6 potentially lifelong ad-
verseoutcomes--pain,mechanicalventi-
lation, tube feeding, coma, confusion, and
living in a nursing home; preferences for
care focused on extending life as much as
possible, even if it means having more
pain and discomfort, vs care focused on
relieving pain and discomfort as much as
possible, even if it means not living as
long; and perceived prognosis for surviv-
ing for 2 and 12 months and for function-
ing independently in 2 and 12 months.22,30
We assessed the effect of the patient's
illness on family members in terms of as-
sistanceneededandsavingsdepleted.28,31
For the Duke Activity Status Index,
missing items were imputed from surro-
gate responses for 5 patients.32
Statistical Analysis
Means are expressed as mean (SD),
and medians are given with 25th and
75th percentiles. Continuous variables
were compared using the Wilcoxon rank
sum test. Within-patient changes over
time were assessed with the Wilcoxon
signed rank test. Concordance between
patients' and their surrogates' time­
trade-off scores was assessed using the
Wilcoxon signed rank test. Univariate
associationsbetweenthetime­trade-off
and the health status measures, mea-
sures of perceived prognosis, willing-
ness to tolerate adverse outcomes, and
demographic variables were assessed
usingSpearmancorrelationcoefficients.
Because time­trade-off scores were
not normally distributed, we used multi-
variable ordinal logistic regression to
identify significant predictors of time­
trade-off scores at day 4 and month 12.
Variables significantly associated with
time­trade-offscoresinunivariateanaly-
ses (when P.10) and variables found to
have been related to time­trade-off
scores in the Study to Understand Prog-
noses and Preferences for Outcomes and
Risks of Treatments study33 were en-
tered into the model and retained
through backward elimination, if P was
less than .05. A summary statistic for the
ordinal logistic regression models is
Somers D, which measures the models'
ability to predict time­trade-off utilities.

ties)thestatisticisalinearfunctionofthe

Within-patient changes in time­
trade-off scores were compared with
changes in other measures using the
Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman cor-
relationcoefficients.Analyseswereper-
formed using SAS statistical software
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patients and Interviews
The HELP study enrolled 1266 pa-
tients. Many patients could not be inter-
viewed: 25 patients (2.0%) were coma-
tose or intubated or both; 272 (21.5%)
were unable to communicate for other
reasons; 204 (16.1%) failed the cognitive
screening test; 29 (2.3%) died or were
discharged within 72 hours; and 2 (0.2%)
were ineligible for other reasons. Of the
734 eligible for interview, 622 (84.7%)
participated.Ofthose622,62(10.0%)ter-
minated the interview before the time­
trade-off question was asked. Of the re-
maining 560 patients, 43 (7.7%) refused

to answer the time­trade-off question,
answered "don't know," or had missing
or incomplete answers. Of the 517 pa-
tients completing the time­trade-off
question at their initial interview, inter-
viewers provided judgments regarding
the patient's understanding in 475 cases
(91.9%);414(87.2%)werejudgedtohave
understood the task. Those 414 patients
formed our main analytic sample (Table
1). In-hospital and 12-month mortality
rates and APS scores were significantly
higher(higherAPSscoresindicatemore
severe illness) for the 852 excluded pa-
tients than for the 414 who completed
the time­trade-off question.
Among the 414 patients, 319 also had
time­trade-off questions completed by
their surrogate at day 4. For the 319 sur-
rogates' interviews, interviewers' judg-
ments regarding understanding of the
time­trade-off question were available
for 311 (97.5%), and the interviewer be-
lievedthat300(96.5%)ofthosesurrogates

tients who had a matching surrogate in-

Health Values
Themean(SD)time­trade-offscorefor
the 414 patients at their initial interview
was 0.81 (0.28) (median [25th, 75th per-
centile],0.92[0.83,1.0]).Thisindicatesthat,
onaverage,patientsequatedliving1year
in their current state of health with living
9.7 months (0.8112 months) in excellent
health. But time­trade-off scores varied
widely from patient to patient (Figure 1):
169(40.8%)hadutilitiesof1.0,meaningthat
they were unwilling to give up any time
in exchange for a shorter life in excellent
health, and another 115 (27.8%) had utili-
ties of 0.92, meaning that they were will-
ing to give up only 1 month of 12 ([1-
0.92]12months)inexchangeforexcellent
health. Thus, more than two thirds of the
patients(284[68.6%])werewillingtoforgo
at most 1 month of 12. At the other ex-
treme, 25 (6.0%) had utilities of 0.04, indi-
cating that they preferred living 2 weeks
or less in excellent health to living 1 year
in their current state of health.
Patients Compared
With Their Surrogates
Time­trade-off scores given by surro-
gates,whowereaskedtoanswerasthey
thought the patient would, also varied
widely. For the 300 patient-surrogate
pairs, the mean (SD) patient utility was
0.80 (0.30) (median [25th, 75th], 0.92
[0.83, 1.0]) and was higher than the
mean surrogate utility by 0.05 (0.38)
(median difference, 0 [0, 0.17]; P=.007);
61(20.3%)ofsurrogatesunderestimated
the patient's time­trade-off score by
0.25 (3 months of 12) or more. The cor-
relation between patients' and their
paired surrogates' health values was
modest (r=0.36).
Relationship of Heath Values
to Other Measures
Time­trade-offutilitieswererelatedto
patients' preferences for CPR (Table 2).
Patients who desired CPR had a mean
(SD) time­trade-off score at day 4 of 0.86
(0.23)(median[25th,75th],0.92[0.83,1.0]);
whereas,patientswhopreferrednottoun-
dergoCPRhadslightlylowermeanscores
of 0.75 (0.34) (median [25th, 75th], 0.92
[0.63, 1.0]; P.001). Higher time­trade-
off scores were also related to patients'
preferences for care that focused on ex-
tending life: patients who preferred care
that focused on extending life had higher
time­trade-off scores (ie, they were not
willing to trade away as much time) than
patients who preferred care that focused
on relieving pain and discomfort.
Health values correlated only mod-
estly (r=0.28) with overall quality of life
(Figure2).Atotalof126patients(30.7%)
rated their current quality of life as ex-
cellent or very good. For the patients
with utilities of 1.0, indicating an unwill-
ingness to trade any time in current
health for a shorter but healthier life,
only 29 (17.3%) considered their quality
of life to be excellent as is; 39 (23.2%)
rated it as very good, 61 (36.3%) as good,
32 (19.0%) as fair, and 7 (4.2%) as poor.
For the patients with utilities of 0.04 or
less, 2 (8.0%) rated their quality of life as
excellent, 3 (12.0%) as very good, 6
(24.0%) as good, 3 (12.0%) as fair, and 11
(44.0%) as poor. Health values corre-
latedmodestly(andinversely)withlevel
of depression (r=-0.27); but they corre-
lated poorly if at all with other health
status measures, willingness to tolerate
the 6 adverse outcomes, and perceived
prognosis for survival and independent
functioning (Table 3). Among the demo-
graphic variables, time­trade-off scores
werenotrelatedtoage,sex,race,orlevel
ofeducation.Inamultivariableanalysis,
on average, patients who preferred
treatment that extended life were more
likely to report high time­trade-off
scores (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 1.8-4.4); in addition,
health values were positively related to
quality of life (OR, 1.2 for each level of
better quality of life; 95% CI, 1.0-1.5) but
wereinverselyrelatedtolevelofdepres-
sion (OR, 0.6 for each level of more se-
verely depressed mood; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7;
Somers D=0.343).
Health Values 1 Year Later
For the 176 patients who completed
the time­trade-off questions at both day
4 and month 12, scores increased over
the year by an average of 0.04, from 0.84
to 0.88 (SD of change, 0.30; median, 0;
25th percentile, -0.08; 75th percentile,
0.08; P=.04). This means that, a year af-
ter hospitalization, on average, the time
patients would give up in their current
state of health to be able to be in excel-
lent health had declined by 2 weeks. As

were not significantly related to the de-

as excellent or very good, but time­
trade-off scores correlated only moder-
ately (r=0.24) with quality of life. In a

COMMENT
Would an elderly person who is frail
and ill prefer living as long as possible
over a shorter but healthy life? This
study ascertained the health values vis-
a
`-vis quantity vs quality of life of a co-
hort of 414 hospitalized patients aged 80
to 98 years. On average, patients indi-
cated a fairly strong "will to live": 40.8%
were unwilling to exchange any time in
theircurrentstateofhealthforashorter
life in excellent health, and 27.8% were
willing to give up at most 1 month of 12
in return for excellent health. The vari-
ance was large, however, with 6.0% of
patients willing to live 2 weeks or less in
excellent health rather than 1 year in
their current state of health. One year
later, surviving patients who could be
interviewed had higher utilities than
during the index hospitalization, but
again there was widespread variation.
The matter of how elderly patients
weigh quantity and quality of life, then,
is highly individualistic. Importantly, our
study demonstrated that the majority of
patientswhocouldbeinterviewedunder-
stoodandcompletedthetaskathand.This
finding, coupled with the findings that
surrogatescouldnotaccuratelygaugepa-
tients' health values and that health val-
ues could not be predicted from demo-
graphicorclinicalvariables,signifiesthat,
when possible, health values should be
ascertained directly from patients.
We are unaware of other studies of
time­trade-off utilities focusing solely on
hospitalizedveryoldpatients.IntheBea-
ver Dam Health Outcomes Study, mean
time­trade-off scores for patients older
than 75 years with any of a variety of
chronic conditions were very similar
(0.79-0.84, depending on age and sex) to
those we report (mean, 0.81); wide indi-
vidual-to-individual variation in utilities
was also seen.34 Compared with previ-
ouslystudiedyoungerpatients,themean
time­trade-off utility of our elderly co-
hort was slightly lower than that of sur-
vivors of myocardial infarction (0.87)35
and slightly higher than that of patients
with the acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (0.79)36 and of seriously ill pa-
tients (0.73).33 The findings that time­
trade-offscoresdonotcorrelatewellwith
health status,13,36-39 are higher than sur-
rogatesbelieve,33 andincreaseovertime33
are by no means unique to the current
study, however.
There are several possible explana-
tions for the abundance of high time­
trade-off scores. First, patients may
have been unwilling to trade much time
for "excellent health" because they
thought that their health was excellent
at the time; yet, when asked directly,
only 13.2% rated it as excellent, and only
17.3% of patients with utilities of 1.0
rated their health as excellent. Second,
we used a short time horizon (1 year) in
the time­trade-off scenarios. It is pos-
sible that, if presented with a longer life
expectancy in current health, patients
would be willing to trade away a larger

proportion for a shorter but healthy life.
Also, the sequence of the time­trade-off
questions or noise in the instrument
could have affected the results.40 Fur-
ther study of such issues and of other
health value measures8 in elderly pa-
tients, sick or healthy, is warranted.
Findings from this study are relevant
for decision making in both clinical prac-
tice and policy making.2,5,10,13 For deci-
sion making at the individual patient
level,time­trade-offutilitiescanbeused
in a general sense to gauge the patient's
"will to live" or, more precisely, as qual-
ity-of-life weights in calculating QALYs
foruseindecisionanalysesassessingthe
risks and benefits of various diagnostic
or therapeutic options.2,11,41,42 For deci-
sions involving the allocation of health
care resources, QALYs form the de-
nominator of cost-effectiveness (cost-
utility) analyses for calculating the in-
cremental costs per incremental QALY
gained for various programs, which may
in turn be compared with each other.2,14
Butweshouldbecautiousaboutpromul-
gating health policy that neglects to in-
corporate the wishes of individual pa-
tients. A recent study of patients with
angina by Nease and colleagues13 that
also found wide interpatient variation in
health values (for their angina) con-
cluded that guidelines for managing is-
chemic heart disease should be based on
individual patients' preferences rather
than symptom severity. Similarly, with
wide variation in the health values of the
very old, there is a risk that guidelines
developedfortheircarewillnotconform
to their preferences.
In summary, health values, as mea-
sured by the time trade-off, of very old
hospitalized patients who can be inter-
viewed (1) can be elicited in most cases;
(2)indicatethatpatientsareunwillingto
trade much time in their current health
state for excellent health; (3) correlate
with few other measures; (4) are higher
thansurrogatesbelieve;and(5)riseover
1 year among surviving patients who
could be reinterviewed. Because health
values vary from patient to patient,
when possible, health values should be
ascertained directly from the patient.
