Introduction
Financial inclusion promotes economic growth. Rural peo-
ple get payments and services at affordable costs. With tech-
nology intervention in financial inclusion, electronic banking
activity in rural India leads to increased savings and better
living standards (The Economist, 2004). Good living stan-
dard paves way to balanced regional development (Donner,
2008; Duncombe & Heeks, 2002; Hudson, 2006). Financial
inclusion campaign routes organized financial system to
low-income strata in a rural region enabling inclusive growth.
Inclusive banking gained pace after 1969 bank nationaliza-
tion further supplemented by micro finance in the 1990s.
Government of India (GOI) commenced financial inclu-
sion campaign in 2006 and established 96,828 Customer
Service Points (CSPs) by March 2012. Banking correspon-
dents (BCs) visited remote locations to give bank services.
Unable to pursue campaign on a large scale, GOI in 2008
constituted Rangarajan committee to assess facts in rural
region. Rangarajan committee defined financial inclusion as
"the process of ensuring access to financial services provid-
ing timely and adequate credit required by vulnerable groups
such as weaker sections and low-income groups at an afford-
able cost" (Vijaya Bhaskar, 2013). Rangarajan committee's
report was an eye opener for banks. Union Budget report of
2007 to 2008 suggested imminent need for financial inclu-
sion. Banks spotted the opportunity in rural regions. Reserve
Bank of India (RBI; 2007) estimated population with no
bank accounts at 41%. One third of Indian population with
51.4% farmer households were not aware of formal finance,
and 73% of excluded rural households had no reach to credit
(Rangarajan Committee, 2008).
Well-planned campaigns educate, train, and clear anxiety
(Carter & Bélanger, 2005). Worldwide, governments have elec-
tronically reengineered their conventional public services to
reach underprivileged segments (Schaupp & Bélanger, 2005).
Developing countries need technologies for economic growth
(Avgerou, 2008). So far, low trust level on government cam-
paigns has hampered e-governance success (Belanger & Hiller,
2006; Carter & Bélanger, 2005; Gefen & Heart, 2006; Shim
etal., 2002; Welch, Hinnant, & Moon, 2005). Low technology
adoption rates and resistance are a matter of concern in develop-
ing countries where high utility and value-based technologies
were resisted (Bélanger & Carter, 2008; B. Gupta, Dasgupta, &
Gupta, 2008; Qian & Dongdong, 2011; Schuppan, 2009).
Planning commission of India, through carefully planned
financial inclusion, vast coverage, and information gaps on
ground realities, hampered progress. As rural people get
farm yield, it is sold for cash. This time spectrum was best

An Empirical Investigation on Mobile
Banking Service Adoption in Rural
Karnataka
S. V. Krishna Kishore1 and Aloysius Henry Sequeira1
Abstract
Government of India (GOI) initialized financial inclusion campaign to quell exclusion. The campaign did not gain expected
progress. Government employed technologies to speed up the process. Among banking technologies, mobile banking
appeared as a possible solution for financial exclusion with wide mobile phone coverage. Inputs on rural people's intention
toward technologies for effective financial inclusion were essential. Technology adoption factors, performance expectancy,
effort expectancy, social influence, attitude, perceived risk, and behavioral intention (BI), were short listed after literature
review. Factors were subjected to reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multiple regression, and interaction analysis.
Rural provinces in Karnataka state were surveyed. We used mixed sampling technique to reach 959 samples. Multiple
regression­interaction analysis revealed age and gender moderated attitude's path toward BI.

for banks to approach farmers. Dasgupta, Paul, and Fuloria
(2011) found that saving habits results in better cash manage-
ment skills among rural people.
Without banks, rural farmers do not save (Sunil, 2013).
Indian banks covered metropolitan areas in the last 30 years,
except rural areas (Manjule & Arunkumar, 2014). For a suc-
cessful inclusive banking, acceptance of banking technology
is imperative (Chugh, 2014).
Problem Identification
Banking sector used technology in 1960. Researches related
technology to economic development. Banking industry
experienced technological changes in information manage-
ment and money transfer. Unnithan and Swatman (2001)
studied technology-mediated banking service. Previous stud-
ies did not give groundbreaking facts. Information technol-
ogy (IT) was widely associated with economic development
strategies in 2003 (World Bank, 2003). According to Khan
Commission Report (2004), India had the second highest
financially excluded households in the world. Initially, RBI
used micro finance institutions (MFIs), business facilitators
(BFs), and BCs to reach remote rural regions. Inclusion cam-
paign did not gain expected success. RBI aimed rules for
mobile banking transactions in 2008. Daily transactions limit
was raised to INR 50,000 (US$1,000; RBI, 2009). RBI
aimed IT and banking services to 600 million new customers
(Ketkar etal., 2012). Mobile banking guidelines emphasized
safety, efficiency, and accessibility (RBI, 2014).
Donner (2008) found more mobile phones possessions
than bank accounts in the world. According to Jiang (2009),
rural areas represent real India. Even after urban migration
trend, 69% of the population are still in rural areas.
Indian government reports show increase in rural branches
from 8,000 in 1969 to 89,000 in 2011. These numbers made
no difference in rural regions. Potnis and Deosthali (2012)
pointed the need to find factors that explain electronic bank-
ing resistance.
Data comparison of the world with two growing nations,
India and Bangladesh, confirms that mobile phones outnum-
ber bank accounts (Table 1). Dahotre (2009) already observed
India as a potential market for mobile banking service imple-
mentation. Business Monitor International (BMI) in 2011
estimated positive trend for e-banking services supported by
Sachin (2012). Fully implemented mobile banking service
offers mini statement, account history check, SMS alerts,
access to card statement, balance check as well as mobile
recharges (Vinayagamoorthy, Sankar, & Sangeetha, 2012).
Bihari (2012) found mobile banking as a valuable addition to
traditional services. Mobile phones are available at just
US$15 (~INR 900) in India. This favored mobile phones dif-
fusion among rural people. However, widespread coverage
and large mobile phone use in Delhi did not result in mobile
banking adoption (S. Singh, 2014).Annesha (2014) observed
a consistent increase of wireless subscribers from 2012 to
2014. Recent developments in the mobile banking domain
are as follows:
·
· Philippines started Smart Money and G-Cash mobile
money transfer services (Wishart, 2006).
·
· MTN offered mobile banking, and WIZZIT money
transfer was also introduced in South Africa
(Richardson, 2008).
·
· Mobile-based DrumNet application was launched in
Kenya and e-diary in Sri Lanka. Farmers earned
US$262 per month (Qiang, Kuek, Dymond, &
Esselaar, 2011).
·
· With 43% of the population in the financially excluded
group, telecom companies and banks in India tied up
to offer mobile savings accounts.
·
· Vodafone and Safaricom started M-PESA in Kenya
around 2005. Initially, there were 2.37 million sub-
scribers. Number of subscribers in 2012 increased to
15 million. This figure comprised 70% of the Kenyan
population. Presently, M-PESA accounts half of the
world's mobile money transfers (CGAP, 2010; Maitrot
& Foster, 2014; Maurer, 2012).
·
· According to Central Intelligence Agency World
Factbook (2013), in the year 2010-2011, nonbank
financial institutions (NBFIs) eyed more market share
as BCs. RBI denied permission for NBFIs.
·
· RBI issued Aadhaar cards to 510 million people and
enabled 182 million information and communication
technology (ICT) bank accounts (RBI, 2014).
·
· Twelve Indian banks in 2010 offered mobile banking
services. Another 61 banks added up by 2014 (RBI,
2014; TRAI, 2013).
Bina and Giaglis (2007) concluded mobile phones as the
best alternatives for financial inclusion. This finding was
already supported based on location free access, real-time
information, and improved control on bank accounts (Krishna

& Walsham, 2005; Laukkanen & Lauronen, 2005; Rao &
Prathima, 2003; Scornavacca & Hoehle, 2007; Varshney &
Vetter, 2002). Archer, Hollingworth, and Halsall (2007) with
Naqvi and Al-Shihi (2009) pointed post 2009 as apt for banks
to look beyond traditional banking. C. Vyas (2009) observed
India and Australia as potential markets for mobile banking
implementation. Mobile banking enables service delivery
from any place, any time (Jonathan, 2010). McKay and
Pickens (2010) concluded branchless banking as 19% cheaper
than traditional banking practices. Potnis and Deosthali
(2012) observed first 1 billion mobile phones slowly moved
in the market until 20 years worldwide. Next 2 billion phones
circulated in 4 years and next 3 billion vanished within a year.
According to 2012 Telecom Regulatory Authority of
India (TRAI; 2012) press release, as of April 7, 2012, wire-
less phone subscribers in India were 911.17 million. Out of
911.17 million, 594.11 million (65.20%) accounted for urban
cities, and rural subscribers were 317.06 million (34.80%).
Indiscriminate service delivery was the prime objective of
public policy. Statistical details such as 17 million out of
143.2 million using mobile Internet in 2011 remain a concern
where telecom and banking industry need to reach unbanked
population (Archana, 2012; R. Gupta & Jain, 2014, 2015;
Ketkar etal., 2012).
Research Gap 1
According to Basu (2005), Dev (2006), and Mohan (2006),
rural institutional credit was extended ignoring facts on rural
people's saving intention. Mobile phones helped drive
growth in saturated markets (Donner & Excobari, 2010).
Hudson (2006) recognized mobile phone's productive role in
agricultural development. Jensen (2007) highlighted the dig-
ital divide as a major issue in developed and developing
countries. Burrell and Anderson (2008) brought out advan-
tages of mobile phones in constrained situations. Indian
banks used business correspondents for inclusive banking
with less success. Banking technology is essential for effec-
tive inclusion (Chung & Kwon, 2009; Duncombe & Boateng,
2009; C. S. Yu, 2012; T. Yu & Fang, 2009).
Research Gap 2
According to Ravichandran and Rai (2000), technology
adoption requires active user participation. Developing
nations face resistance in technology implementation
(Kleijnen, Wetzels, & de Ruyter, 2004). Suoranta and Mattila
(2004) expressed concern on low mobile banking adoption
rates in the world. Riivari (2005) and Y.-S. Wang, Lin, and
Luarn (2006) concluded technological advances and service
availability do not trigger adoption. Mallat, Rossi, and
Tunainen (2004) and Y.-S. Wang and Liao (2007) empha-
sized reason behind fewer mobile phone transactions to be
studied. Mobile banking with convenience, ubiquity, and
interactivity solves coverage problem (Bihari, 2011). In
India, mobile phones have penetration than computers.
Vaishnavi (2011) and Dash (2014) observed India lags
behind other countries in mobile payment adoption with a
very large potential.
Research Gap 3
The mobile phone is simple compared with computers.
Carroll (2005) pointed mobile phones diffusion in urban,
suburban, and rural areas unexpectedly fast. Widespread
mobile phones diffusion did not result in mobile banking
adoption (Laforet & Li, 2005; Luarn & Lin, 2005;
Scornavacca & Hoehle, 2007). H. Kim, Chan, and Gupta
(2007) recommended more studies on mobile banking adop-
tion. Indians have consistently resisted new technologies
(Chaipoopirutana, Combs, Chatchawanwan, & Vij, 2009;
Laukkanen & Pasanen, 2008; Maurer, 2008; Puschel,
Mazzon, & Hernandez, 2010; Zarifopoulos & Economides,
2009). Knowledge on motivators and inhibitors of mobile
banking technology is required (Ashta & Assadi, 2011; H. F.
Lin, 2011; Thakur & Srivastava, 2014).
Research Gap 4
Wareham, Zheng, and Straub (2005) attracted information
system (IS) researchers toward mobile commerce. Observing
mobile commerce growth, more e-payment feasibility stud-
ies by Harle and Beresford (2005); H. Wang, Cao, and Zhang
(2005); Gianluigi, Strangio, and Schuster (2006); and Huang
and Boucouvalas (2006) surfaced. Kendall, Kendall, and
Kah (2006) supporting Ravichandran and Rai (2000) high-
lighted necessity of people's participation in technology
adoption campaigns. Laukkanen and Cruz (2009) and K. Lee
and Chung (2009) observed mobile banking idea gaining
awareness in the world. International Telecom Union (ITU)
stated, out of 5 billion users worldwide, India had already
500 million telecom subscribers by December 2009.
According to R. Singh (2009) and S. Singh, Srivastava, and
Srivastava (2010), low-cost mobile phones sold well in
Indian markets supported by Zainudeen and Ratnadiwakara
(2011). Khalifa, Cheng, and Shen (2012) predicted the
mobile industry would surpass US$119 billion mark from
tiny US$18.3 billion industry. Every year in India, after
2008, more than 100 million mobile subscribers added to
telecom density (Vishal, Pandey, & Sanjay, 2012).
Research Objectives
The article investigates mobile banking service adoption in
rural Karnataka. Subobjectives assess the relationship of
independent variables, performance expectancy (PE), effort
expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), attitude, and per-
ceived risk (PR), with dependent variable, behavioral inten-
tion (BI). The study also attempts to measure moderation of
age and gender on PE, EE, SI, and attitude's path toward BI.

Prior Research and Theoretical
Background
In literature review, various theoretical models in IT/IS
domain were reviewed. Conceptual models had roots in psy-
chology and sociology explaining technology acceptance
(Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). Technology adoption was a dis-
tinguished area in IS research (Benbasat & Barki, 2007;
Venkatesh, Davis, & Morris, 2007).
Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) introduced "Theory of
Reasoned Action" (TRA). TRA had three variables, namely,
BI, attitude, and subjective norm. In 1980, Ajzen and
Fishbein revised TRA as "Theory of Planned Behavior"
(TPB) later known as "Decomposed Theory of Planned
Behavior" (DTPB). DTPB used relative advantage, compat-
ibility, and risk variables. These variables belonged to
Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, also known as
Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). Rogers (1995) intro-
duced DOI with five attributes: relative advantage, complex-
ity, trialability, compatibility, and observability. Out of five
variables in DOI, relative advantage, complexity, and com-
patibility were consistently related to innovation adoption.
Davis in 1986 studied computer-usage behavior. Davis
(1989) improved TRA framework to Technology Acceptance
Model (TAM) with perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived
ease of use (PEOU) as basic factors. Venkatesh and Davis
(2000) improved TAM to TAM2. TAM2 examined PU and
usage intention from SI perspective.
TAM was influential and famous. Various empirical plat-
forms tested TAM for measurement validity. Adoption stud-
ies based on TAM investigated simple technologies. TAM
studies used teenagers and students in universities.
Generalization of findings was questionable (Legris, Ingham,
& Collerette, 2003).
Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis (2003) had already
introduced Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
Technology (UTAUT). UTAUT explained the adoption of
complex technologies like online bulletin boards and instant
messengers, online stock trading (Yang, 2005), electronic
marketplaces (Y.-S. Wang et
al., 2006), and mobile com-
merce adoption in Finland (Carlsson, Waiden, & Bouwman,
2006; Park, Yang, & Lehto, 2007). Fruhling and Vreede
(2006) and Lucas, Swanson, and Zmud (2007) reviewed IS
adoption studies on TAM and stressed on the need to look
beyond TAM. UTAUT is a powerful framework (Goodhue,
2007). There are limited studies on UTAUT investigating
mobile banking adoption (Samudra & Phadtare, 2012).
Research Gap 5
UTAUT condenses 32 variables not only from TAM but also
from Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) by Bandura (1977) and
Compeau and Higgins (1995), Model of Personal Computer
Usage (MPCU) by Triandis (1977) and Thompson, Higgins,
and Howell (1991), and Motivational Model (MM) by Davis,
Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1992). UTAUT helped to study
mind-sets of people at organizational and nonorganizational
environments. Johns (2006) and Alvesson and Kärreman
(2007) suggested borrowing and experimenting variables
improve a theory. Moderating variable (MV) inclusion in
UTAUT boosts its ability to measure interaction effects
(Bagozzi, 2007). Three types of UTAUT extensions are as
follows:
1. Studying new users (Yi, Jackson, Park, & Probst,
2006), new technologies (Chang, Hwang, Hung, &
Li, 2007), and new cultural settings (B. Gupta etal.,
2008);
2. The new addition of constructs to test endogenous
variables (K. Y. Chan, Gong, Xu, & Thong, 2008;
Sun, Bhattacherjee, & Ma, 2009);
3. Addition of exogenous variables (Neufeld, Dong, &
Higgins, 2007; Yi etal., 2006).
Al-Gahtani, Hubona, and Wang (2007) and Armida
(2008) pointed out the requirement of systematic investiga-
tion of technology adoption as earlier studies did not research
moderators. Initially, UTAUT catered to technology accep-
tance explanation in organizations. Later, the framework was
also used to study consumer technologies as it was a multi-
billion dollar industry (Llamas & Stofega, 2010). Basic con-
structs of UTAUT, PE, EE, SI, and facilitating condition
consistently measured BI. Innovations and perceived enjoy-
ment constructs effectively measured actual usage (Thakur,
2013).
Hypothesis Development
Variables PE, EE, SI, and BI are from UTAUT. Study
dropped facilitating condition variable as its items measured
after sales service aspect. Study has added attitude and PR
variables to theoretical framework from TAM as each exper-
iment is a quest for more knowledge (Alvesson & Kärreman,
2007).
PE. PE describes the extent of benefits technology offers in a
job. Nysveen, Pedersen, and Thorbjørnsen (2005a, p. 252)
stated, "If a system doesn't assist its users performing jobs, it
is not received." PE consistently relates to BI at voluntary
(nonorganizational) and involuntary (organizational) settings
(Al-Qeisi, 2009; Jack, Suri, and Townsend (2010); Venkatesh
etal., 2003).
We can compare PE with relative advantage (McCloskey,
2006; Plouffe, Hulland, & Vandenbosch, 2001; Rogers,
2003), convenience, affordability (H. F. Lin, 2011), and PU
in TAM (Venkatesh et
al., 2003). Previous studies of
Pikkarainen, Pikkarainen, Karjaluoto, and Pahnila (2004)
and Cheong and Park (2005) uphold PU's role in technology
adoption studies. Eriksson, Kerem, and Nilsson (2005);
Luarn and Lin (2005), and Chiu, Hsu, Sun, Lin, and Sun
Kishore and Sequeira 5
(2005) linked PU to BI supported by Guriting and Ndubisi
(2006). PU helped to study performance aspects in technol-
ogy adoption. Venkatesh and Bala (2008), Chung and Kwon
(2009), Daud and Yusoff (2011), T. Zhou (2011), and
Padashetty and Krishna (2013) studied and validated PU
performance.
PE was consistently related to BI in adoption studies of
online context (Koufaris, 2002; J. C. C. Lin & Lu, 2000),
productivity in the workplace (O'Cass & Grace, 2004; Yang,
2005), Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), phones
(Nysveen, Pedersen, & Thorbjornsen, 2005b), and mobile
commerce (Y.-S. Wang etal., 2006). Lai, Lai, and Jordan
(2009); Luo, Li, Zhang, and Shim (2010); T. Zhou, Lu, and
Wang (2010); Bumguardner, Strong, Murphrey, and Dooley
(2014); and Marchewka and Kostiwa (2014) concluded PE
influences BI. This leads us to hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): PE about mobile banking service
technology has a positive impact on user's intention to
adopt it.
EE. EE was consistently related to BI in both organizational
and nonorganizational settings. EE effectively measures
technology adoption behavior in pretechnology implementa-
tion stages. Postimplementation studies cannot access details
of product/service features (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000). EE
is ease of learning a technology (Meuter, Ostrom, Roundtree,
& Bitner, 2000; Venkatesh & Brown, 2001; Venkatesh etal.,
2003). EE evolved from PEOU and complexity variable.
Complex technologies face resistance (Y. E. Lee & Benbasat,
2004; Meuter, Bitner, Ostrom, & Brown, 2005; Venkatesh &
Zhang, 2010).
Usability characteristics explain PEOU (Lederer, Maupin,
Sena, & Zhaung, 2000). Plouffe etal. (2001) and Venkatesh
etal. (2003) have linked EE to PEOU as they both measure
complexity levels in technology usage. Better ease of use
promotes usefulness (Au & Kauffman, 2008; Mallat, 2007;
Ondrus & Pigneur, 2006; Venkatesh & Davis, 2000;
Vrechopoulos, Constantiou, Sideris, Doukidis, &
Mylonopoulos, 2003). Ease of use in mobile services is a
crucial factor for adoption (C. Kim, Mirusmonov, & Lee,
2010; H. F. Lin, 2011).
According to Venkatesh (2000), inexperienced people in
surveys respond based on beliefs. PEOU was strongly related
to BI in TAM, TAM2, and combined technology acceptance
model and technology planned behavior (C-TAM-TPB;
Venkatesh et
al., 2003; Y.-S. Wang, Wang, Lin, & Tang,
2003). There are various aspects of experience (Luarn & Lin,
2005; Venkatesh & Davis, 2000; Y.-S. Wang & Liao, 2007).
Amin, Hamid, Lada, and Anis (2008) observed the PEOU's
relationship with BI in mobile banking service adoption.
PEOU was also used by AL Rawashdeh, Abu-Errub, Areiqat,
and Dbbaghieh (2012) to study e-learning adoption, Internet
pass delivery adoption (M. Y. Wu, Yu, & Weng, 2012),
e-books adoption (Gao & Deng, 2012), and interaction board
adoption (Wong & Dioko, 2013).
Foon and Fah (2011); Pappas, Giannakos, Pateli, and
Chrissikopoulos (2011); Yahya, Nadzar, Masrek, and
Rahman (2011); Govender and Sihlali (2012); Moghavvemi,
Salleh, Zhao, and Mattila (2012); and Jeong and Yoon (2013)
validated significant relationship of EE and BI. Hence, we
hypothesized the following:
Hypothesis 2 (H2): EE about mobile banking service
technology has a positive impact on user's intention to
adopt it.
SI. SI is an individual's belief on other's expectation of him
or her to use a system (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000). SI con-
struct consists of family, relatives, and friends items (Peder-
sen & Ling, 2002). SI has two facets. That is interpersonal
and external influence in DOI theory. Interpersonal influence
occurs from family, friends, neighbors, and relations,
whereas media externally influences (Bhattacherjee, 2001;
Teo & Pok, 2003). SI in UTAUT evolved from social factors,
social image, and subjective norms. S. Singh etal. (2010),
Puschel etal. (2010), and Riquelme and Rios (2010) noticed
the strong family and friends influence in technology adop-
tion. Social norm explains SI. SI is a perception an individual
holds on people important to him or her expecting a particu-
lar behavior (Puschel etal., 2010).
Karahana and Limayem (2000) validated social norm by
studying email acceptance (Hsu & Lu, 2004), online games
(S. C. Chan & Lu, 2004), Internet banking (Riquelme &
Rios, 2010; Schepers & Wetzels, 2007), and mobile banking
adoption. Dahlberg, Mallat, Ondrus, and Zmijewska (2008)
and Puschel etal. (2010) found a significant relationship of
social norm with BI. van Biljon and Kotze (2008) found two
facets of social pressure. They are neighbors and family as
well as relations. Puschel and Mazzon (2010) studied prod-
uct decision patterns for Internet service adoption using SI.
Rural people depend on opinion leaders for decision mak-
ing. In these situations, SI provides vital inputs on varied
belief structures and attitudes. Venkatesh and Davis (2000),
Cheong and Park (2008), Akour (2009), Lai etal. (2009),
Williams (2009), C. Kim etal. (2010), and Chen and Chang.
(2011) validated SI effect on BI. Therefore, we hypothesized
the following:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): SI about mobile banking service
technology has a positive impact on user's intention to
adopt it.
Attitude.Attitude variable was widely used in TAM (Fish-
bein & Ajzen, 1975). The attitude variable provides insight
on favorable and unfavorable beliefs about a specific behav-
ior (Xu, 2006). Attitude explained adoption leading to inten-
tion development for decades (Schepers & Wetzels, 2007).
Ajzen and Fishbein linked attitude to BI as early as 1980.
Their work garnered good support.
TRA and TPB models assume that intention exactly pre-
dicts an individual's behavior better. Ajzen in 1985 argued
6 SAGE Open
intention as a function of attitude and reiterated again in
2002. Attitude is an outcome of personal influence and SI
(Nysveen etal., 2005b). Later, Nysveen etal. (2005b) con-
cluded relationship between attitude and BI varies for tech-
nologies in service sectors. Tsang, Ho, and Liang (2004),
Park et
al. (2007), Gao and Deng (2012), and Asif and
Krogstie (2012) validated attitude's relationship with inten-
tion. This led us to hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Attitude about mobile banking ser-
vice technology has a positive impact on user's intention
to adopt it.
PR. PR is an insecure feeling about technologies (Bebko, 2000;
M. Kim & Lennon, 2000; Venkatesh & Brown, 2001). During
1960s, technology adoption studies used PR variable (Laroche,
McDougall, Bergeron, & Yang, 2004). Doubts augment risk
perception on technologies (Chen, 2008; Gewald, Wüllenwe-
ber, & Weitzel, 2006; I. Lee, Choi, Kim, & Hong, 2007;
Ndubisi & Sinti, 2006). Risk perception includes low trust,
technological anxiety, and behavioral introspection variables.
Security is a concern for banks in the mobile banking intro-
duction where data safety (Coursaris, Hassanein, & Head,
2003), security aspect (Luarn & Lin, 2005), and immediate
action on lost PIN codes (Kuisma etal., 2007; Poon, 2008)
need attention. Strategy plays an important role in managing
consumer anxiety (G. Kim, Shin, & Lee, 2009; Koenig-Lewis,
Palmer, & Moll, 2010). Banks need strong know your cus-
tomer (KYC) norms (Dasgupta etal., 2011). Privacy issues
fuel increased risk perception (Bansal, Zahedi, & Gefen, 2010;
Dupas, Green, Keats, & Robinson, 2012; Eastlick, Lotz, &
Warrington, 2006; Greenberg & Baron, 2008; Lim, 2003;
Malhotra, Kim, & Agarwal, 2004; Tan & Teo, 2000). PR
gained recognition from scholars in IS studies by providing
insight on hidden intentions behind a conduct. Service intangi-
bility makes consumer decision complex and sensitive (Bebko,
2000; J. Kim & Lennon, 2013; Laroche etal., 2004).
Pavlou (2003) described PR as user's expectation of loss
in the course of achieving targeted result. Coursaris etal.
(2003) observed 62,000 mobile phones lost by London taxi
passengers. J. H. Wu and Wang (2005) found a significant
relationship between PR and intention studying mobile com-
merce adoption at Taiwan. Furthermore, Gu, Lee, and Suh
(2009); Luo et
al. (2010); Safeena, Date, and Kammani
(2011); Monitise (2012); and Sathya and Sabhyasachi (2015)
found PR as a major barrier in mobile banking adoption.
Therefore, we can hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 5 (H5): PR about mobile banking service
technology has a negative impact on user's intention to
adopt it.
BI. BI is defined as the degree of user's willingness to use
new technology. Ajzen and Fishbein in 1980 introduced BI
as reliable predictor. Multiattribute models used BI. Ajzen
and Fishbein explored consumer belief, attitudes, and inten-
tions. Most of the technology adoption frameworks used BI
as the dependent variable. Predicting outcomes were better
(DeLone & McLean, 2003; Venkatesh etal., 2003).
Featherman and Fuller (2003); Cunningham, Gerlach,
and Harper (2004); and Lapointe and Rivard (2005) con-
cluded BI development patterns vary, and they depend on
features of technologies. BI played vital role in IS adoption
studies (Y.-S. Wang & Liao, 2007; T. Zhou etal., 2010).
UTAUT had voluntariness of use and experience as MVs.
They were only significant in organizational settings. Prior
experiences of mobile banking were nil in rural areas, and
therefore, study selected age and gender for moderation anal-
ysis. Age and gender are demographic variables. Baker,
Al-Gahtani, and Hubona (2007); Sulaiman, Jaafar, and
Mohezar (2007); Harma and Dubey (2009); and Alafeef,
Singh, and Ahmad (2011) validated importance of age and
gender role in IS research.
Gender (MV). Gender is one of the crucial variables in con-
sumer behavior research (Forsythe & Chun, 2000). Lack of
gender-based studies, especially in mobile banking adoption
research, was clear (Thomas & Taskov, 2007; Venkatesh &
Morris, 2000). Some isolated technology adoption studies
are found on email (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000), information
retrieval (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000), e-learning (Ong &
Lai, 2006), communication technologies (Laforet & Li,
2005), and online purchasing behavior (Thomas & Taskov,
2007).
Morris and Venkatesh (2000) identified gender and age
differences in technology adoption. Venkatesh and Morris
(2000) and Venkatesh (2000) concluded EE as a stronger
determinant for women than men supported by Venkatesh
etal. (2003). Kirchmeyer (2002) observed gender can give
psychological insight explaining mobile banking adoption
behavior. Perea y Monsuwé, Dellaert, and de Ruyter (2004)
found that men were interested than women in the online
shopping trail. Females preferred more catalog and mall
shopping. Consistent records of age and gender moderation
were found in the literatures (Nysveen et
al., 2005b;
Venkatesh etal., 2003).
According to Venkatesh, Morris, and Ackerman (2000),
PU affected attitudes at the workplace where external sug-
gestions shaped female attitude. Lynott and McCandless
(2000) observed that gender role depends on birthplace and
culture. Gender and age were widely acclaimed by Venkatesh
etal. (2003) as key determinants. Garbarino and Strahilevitz
(2004) and Nysveen etal. (2005a, 2005b) stated gender as
important demographic variable in technology adoption
studies. Li and Kishore (2006) theorized that gender moder-
ates the relationship in the path of PE, EE, and SI leading to
BI. We can hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 7a (H7a): The influence of PE on develop-
ment of BI is moderated by gender.
Kishore and Sequeira 7
Hypothesis 7b (H7b): The influence of EE on develop-
ment of BI is moderated by gender.
Hypothesis 7c (H7c): The influence of SI on develop-
ment of BI is moderated by gender.
Hypothesis 7d (H7d): The influence of attitude on devel-
opment of BI is moderated by gender.
According to Fernando and Porter (2002), men adopt tech-
nologies faster than women. Slyke, Comunale, and Belanger
(2002) found gender moderation in Internet banking adoption
supported by Lichtenstein and Williamson (2006). Sulaiman
etal. (2007) in a Malaysian study found 70% of men pre-
ferred mobile banking compared with 34.4% females as men
read more technology magazines. Females used more online
shopping than men. In the latest research on gender differ-
ences, L. Zhou, Dai, and Zhang (2007) identified gap reduc-
tion in gender behaviors. Porter (2008), further explaining
Fernando and Porter's (2002) findings, concluded that, in the
transportation sector, males adopted technologies faster as
their occupation demanded it. Kwiatkowski, Zettlemoyer,
Goldwater, and Steedman (2010) observed low-cost online
service drives mobile banking adoption.
Age. Affiliation needs increase with age. Elderly people with
low experience gave more importance for SI (Venkatesh &
Morris, 2000). Older people resisted scanners (Oumlil &
Williams, 2000). Age was preferred by psychology research-
ers and practitioners (Mattila, Karjaluoto, & Pento, 2003).
While reviewing age literature, the quest was on whether
young or old people prefer technology. Sulaiman etal. (2007)
found that younger age group was interested in technologies.
Laukkanen (2007a, 2007b) related education and income of
people with adoption. According to Rettie (2008), age
explained adoption than gender in Western geographies.
Venkatesh and Goyal (2010) theorized gender and age mod-
erating independent variables in UTAUT model. This lead us
hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 8a (H8a): The influence of PE on develop-
ment of BI is moderated by age.
Hypothesis 8b (H8b): The influence of EE on develop-
ment of BI is moderated by age.
Hypothesis 8c (H8c): The influence of SI on develop-
ment of BI is moderated by age.
Hypothesis 8d (H8d): The influence of attitude on devel-
opment of BI is moderated by age.
Moderation findings in UTAUT are reliable (Venkatesh
etal., 2003).Varied demographic patterns and cultural influence
make studying age complicated. Most researchers have found
aging results in low intellectual ability. Harma and Dubey
(2009) observed 20 to 30 age group corporate people had a low
PR on mobile banking. Needs and preferences change with age.
Age and gender are crucial in moderating paths of independent
and dependent variables (Y. C. Lee, Li, Yen, & Huang, 2010).
Research Methodology
The study probes prevailing mobile banking service adop-
tion problem by descriptive approach.
Data Collection
A questionnaire consisted of variables and their items.
Questionnaire measured items on a 7-point scale. Technology
adoption studies in nonorganizational setting measured vari-
ables on a 7-point scale. Survey method execution prompted
administering of questionnaire.
Sampling Design
The mixed sampling technique helped to reach 959 samples.
The technique combines probability and nonprobability sam-
pling methods. Absence of sample frame led to use of non-
probabilistic sampling method. Mixed sampling enhances
internal and external validity of a study. It facilitates general-
ization with less bias in procedure.
Probabilistic sampling methods randomly pick samples.
Probabilistic sampling requires a sample frame. Villagers'
list of names (sample frame) was not clearly available. The
Indian Census database as sample frame was a clear fit in
sampling process (see http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_
Data_2001/Village_Directory/List_of_Villages/List_of_
Villages_Alphabetical.aspx?cki=&ComboState_Code=29).
With systematic probability sampling, villages were ran-
domly selected. Nonprobabilistic sampling permits inclusion
or exclusion of population elements in a sample. Researcher
used judgmental sampling to include rural respondents in the
sample (see Figure 1).
Probabilistic sampling method randomly picked villages
from a vast exhaustive list of villages in Karnataka using
2011 census. Calculation of Kth element is as follows:
K
N
n
= ,
where N is the population size, and n is the sample size.
Rural population of Karnataka was 37,469,335 (N); 959 (n)
was sample size. When substituted, the result was 39,071. So
39,071 was kth element. Every 39,071th village in the exhaus-
tive list was a rural area for the survey. Judgmental sampling
helped in identifying the respondent depending on his or her
ability to understand and respond to queries. The survey col-
lected a total of 972 samples, out of which 959 samples were
eligible for editing, coding, and tabulating processes.
Data Analysis and Interpretation
Data analysis consisted of various steps. The procedure
examined coded data before analysis. The steps involved in
data analysis are as follows:
8 SAGE Open
1. Data screening for treatment (missing data, unen-
gaged responses, outliers)
2. Reliability analysis (for Cronbach's  values above
.70)
3. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) for validity
4. Multiple regression analysis
5. Mean centering instead of median split
6. Interaction/moderation analysis (Aiken and West's
approach, Jeremy Dawson's approach).
After treating data, constructs of theoretical framework
were subjected to reliability analysis. Convincing values of
Cronbach's alpha cleared the way for EFA. EFAwas conducted
to check sample adequacy by Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO)
test and convergent validity of the constructs. Principal compo-
nents analysis (PCA) extracted pure and true eigenvalues.
While performing EFA, multicollinearity was also examined to
decide on rotation pattern. As there was no correlation among
constructs, variables were orthogonally rotated with varimax
rotation. After confirming validity and successful extraction of
constructs, multiple regression analysis revealed relationship
strengths. In the interaction analysis, every data entry influ-
ences the output. Interaction approach followed mean center-
ing for accurate results. Previous studies used median split.
Median split, though widely followed, was not supported by IS
adoption researchers (Irwin & McClelland, 2003). Splitting
converts a continuous variable to categories (low, high) on the
basis of median. Studies that preferred median split were much
familiar using ANOVA not regression analysis. Median split
results in loss of predicting power in a continuous variable
(Aiken & West, 1991). Nearly one third of the data are lost
(MacCallum etal., 2002) and lead to false conclusions (Austin,
Barbir, Ferris, & Garg, 2004; McClelland, Lynch, Irwin,
Spiller, & Fitzsimons, 2015). Centering was essential in inter-
val scale measurement. Centering concentrates power in vari-
ables (Snijders & Bosker, 2012). Later interaction moderation
analysis output provided interesting insights on relationships.
Preanalysis Data Screening
The details of factor and reliability analysis are as follows
(see Table 2).
PCA method perfectly loads variables with small dimen-
sions (Berk, 2008). All items under six factors loaded on
their constructs. KMO test and Bartlett's test for sample ade-
quacy were significant at 0.853, explaining 62.75% of vari-
ance from six factors. Gorsuch (1983) recommended
minimum sample size of 100 for EFA. Comrey and Lee
(1992) suggested 100 samples are poor for EFA, 200 to 300
are good, 500 are very good, and 1,000 samples are excellent
supported by Pearson and Mundform (2010). Sample size
959 was convincing for EFA (see Table 3).
Reliability value of the model remained .798. Constructs
exceeded the acceptable norm of .50 to .60. Reliability score
of all constructs met Hari, Egbu, and Kumar's (2006)
required alpha value of mobile banking adoption constructs
(equal or more than .70).
In multiple regression analysis, we followed Aiken and
West's approach for mean centering of variables. Tables 4 to
6 represent a multiple regression analysis.
R and R2 values were .583 and .340. ANOVA was statisti-
cally significant. Independent variables, PE, EE, SI,Attitude,
and PR, were significantly related to dependent variable BI.
H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 were satisfied.
Centered variables were further subjected to interaction
analysis. Gender was not centered as it was a perfect categor-
ical variable. Attitude had interaction effect by age and gen-
der. Tables 7 to 9 and diagrams of interaction analysis are as
follows.
Gender moderated attitude's path to BI. R and R2 values
were .466 and .217. ANOVA was significant. Interaction was
significantly related (.028) with beta -.182. Figure 2 is an
interaction output.
The interaction plot follows Jeremy Dawson's approach.
Gender dampened positive relationship between BI and atti-
tude (see Tables 10-12).

Age moderated attitude's path to BI. R and R2 values were
.466 and .217. ANOVA was significant. Interaction variable
was significant (.032) with beta value .081 (see Figure 3).
Age strengthened the positive relationship of attitude and
BI, but the gender weakened relationship. Age provided vital
insight on mobile banking adoption behavior in rural
Karnataka (see Figure 4).
Among H6 and H7, only H6d and H7d were statistically
significant. H6a, H6b, H6c, H7a, H7b, and H7c were not sta-
tistically significant. Results are found in the online
appendix.
Implications
Technology, installed just as a part of the campaign, is aim-
less. Hands on training and demonstrations drive adoption
(Keengwe etal., 2008). By the findings, it was clear that if
mobile banking technology improves job performance com-
pared with traditional banking methods, it gets adopted as
PE was related to BI. If mobile banking service is easier to
learn, rural people would adopt it as part of EE's relationship
with BI. SI revealed a mild influence of family members and
friends on people in adopting mobile banking service. The
attitude was significantly related to the BI signaling presence
of favorable environment for mobile banking service. PR
had a negative relationship indicating risk perception of rural
people. In interaction analysis, age strengthened attitude's
relationship with BI. Higher the age of an individual, more
positive would be the individual's attitude leading to BI
development.
Implication on Academics
Generalization is tough for academicians in adoption and
interaction curve predictions due to uneven demographic

Kärreman (2007) and Johns (2006), geographical variables
of various adoption stages (timelines) would give ground-
breaking knowledge on technology adoptions supported by
Stofega and Ilamas (2009). Survey projects funded by gov-
ernment research agencies such as the NCAER (National

financial inclusion. These projects improve financial literacy
among rural people. Rural people can learn the need of open-
ing and sustaining bank accounts. Bank transactions enhance
their cash management skills and increase national financial
depth.
E-Commerce offers bank opportunity in mobile banking
service. Mobile currency service providers can get a gist of
rural population's mind-set by academic studies. The cam-
paigns should communicate mobile banking advantages.
Ease of use variable gives product/service implication

information to corporate sector (Venkatesh, Thong, Chan,
Hu, & Brown, 2011). Mild SI relationship with BIs indicates
probability of opinion leader's influence to help technology
adoption. Corporates can target promotions of mobile bank-
ing services with opinion leaders. The issue of risk percep-
tion needs attention. Instilling confidence and trust eliminates
gossips and grapevines. As more aged people are with favor-
able attitude, people aged 30 years can also be targeted
based on mobile banking's valuable contribution to their
occupation and lifestyle. Academics can supplement corpo-
rate with crucial inputs to target campaigns. Companies can
design campaigns to diffuse mobile banking service technol-
ogy among rural people (Munongo & Chitungo, 2013;
Sathya & Sabhyasachi, 2015).
Conclusion
Mobile phones are the future of financial transaction. It
should reach average person (Sharma & Kansal, 2012).
Favorable attitude was found in rural people. These factorial
relationships hold crucial information for technology
diffusion.
Relevance of Findings
The findings were relevant with earlier studies conducted by
IS adoption scholars. List of supporting studies in chrono-
logical order is as follows:

PR was negatively related to BI in the study. PR was
found to be a barrier, supported by Gu etal. (2009), Luo
etal. (2010), Safeena etal. (2011), Monitise (2012), and
Sathya and Sabhyasachi (2015).
Gender moderated attitude's path to BI. Gender's moder-
ation was supported by Kirchmeyer (2002), Venkatesh
et
al. (2003), Garbarino and Strahilevitz (2004), and
Nysveen etal. (2005a).
The age moderated attitude's path toward BI. Mattila
et
al. (2003); Laforet and Li (2005); Laukkanen et
al.
(2007); Flinders (2008); Cruz, Filgueiras Neto, Muñoz-
Gallego, and Laukkanen (2010); and Venkatesh et
al.
(2010) supported age's moderation. Findings unsupported
by earlier studies are given in Table 13.
IS Studies from 2008 to present timeline supported our
findings. Compared with PE, EE, and attitude's strength, SI's
relationship with BI was weak. However, responses indi-
cated that surrounding people mildly influenced rural peo-
ple's choice in mobile banking service adoption. PR was
negatively related to BI. SI consistently did not influence BI
in the Venkatesh and Morris (2000) and Chau and Hu (2001)
studies. Venkatesh etal.'s (2003) study upholds varied demo-
graphic distributions as a reason. Kleijnen etal. (2004) and
S. C. Chan and Lu (2004) used SI construct to study wireless
finance adoption and Internet banking, where a significant
relationship with BI was clear. Gender dampened strength
between attitude and BI. Age strengthened the relationship.
The study did not support the Ben Oumlil and Williams
(2000). Laukkanen and Lauronen's (2005) findings were
older age resulted in lesser chances of technology adoption.
A study supported rare finding of Karjaluoto, Pakola, Pietilä,
and Svento (2003), where middle-aged people (30-49 years)
adopted technology faster than younger people. Furthermore,
Laforet and Li (2005) in china, Flinders (2008) in Japan, and
Cruz etal. (2010) in Brazil had similar conclusions. Study
concludes rural elders have a favorable attitude leading to BI
development adopting mobile banking service.
Future Scope of the Study
In Pune (Maharashtra), electricity payment, telephone bill
payments, and funds transfers are already launched as pilot
projects. Future studies can aim inclusion of more independent
variables and dependent variables with added moderators at an
expanded territory. SI apart from the present practice of mea-
suring in basic items can also be measured from social net-
work sources (Goldstein & Cialdini, 2009; Sykes, Venkatesh,
& Gosain, 2009). This can work well in an urban setting.
According to Central Intelligence Agency (2011), India is a
mixture of multilingual, multiethnic symphony. North and
South India are demographically different. Identical financial
inclusion campaigns all over the country may not yield suc-
cess. As moderations of age and gender have occurred, espe-
cially in the path of attitude to BI, more studies can also focus
on exploring attitude and its nearest components leading
toward development of BI.
