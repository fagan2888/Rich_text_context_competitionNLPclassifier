Abstract
Objective: To evaluate peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in adult women
with iron deficiency anaemia and healthy control subjects.
Methods: Women with iron deficiency anaemia and age- and sex-matched healthy control
subjects were sequentially recruited and underwent detailed ophthalmic examination, including
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Serum haemoglobin (Hb), iron and ferritin
concentrations, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and mean corpuscular volume were determined.
Results: Peripapillary RNFL thicknesses in the nasal and inferior quadrants were significantly
smaller in patients (n ¼ 40) than in controls (n ¼ 40). In the patient group, there were significant
correlations between inferior quadrant RNFL thickness and Hb, and between nasal quadrant RNFL
thickness and serum iron and ferritin concentrations, and TIBC.
Conclusion: Iron deficiency anaemia reduces RNFL thickness in adult women.

Introduction
Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common
form of anaemia, especially in women of
childbearing age.1 Iron is necessary for
normal myelination;2 auditory and visually
evoked potentials are reduced due to hypo-
myelination in patients with iron deficiency.3
In addition, iron is essential for structural
stability and maintenance of the optic
nerve.4 Optical coherence tomography

(OCT) is a noninvasive imaging method that
is widely used in the diagnosis of optic nerve
and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) dis-
eases.5 The spectral domain OCT technique
provides faster acquisition, better resolution
and improved imaging of retinal morph-
ology than traditional OCT.6
In children with thalassaemia major and/
or iron deficiency anaemia, OCT studies
found that RNFL thicknesses decreased,
relative to reduced haemoglobin and ferritin
concentrations.7,8 To the best of our know-
ledge, RNFL thickness in adult women with
iron deficiency anaemia has not been stu-
died. The aim of the present study, there-
fore, was to evaluate RNFL thickness in
adult women with iron deficiency anaemia,
and in age- and sex-matched healthy control
subjects.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study sequentially recruited women
aged 19­54 years who were diagnosed with
iron deficiency anaemia at the haematology
polyclinic of Recep Tayyip Erdogan
University School of Medicine Research
and Training Hospital, Rize, Turkey,
between May 2014 and July 2014. Iron
deficiency anaemia was defined as haemo-
globin (Hb) concentrations <12 g/dl and
ferritin concentrations <15 mg/l.
Women without iron deficiency anaemia
who were attending the Internal Medicine
outpatient clinic of Recep Tayyip Erdogan
University School of Medicine Research and
Training Hospital, Rize, Turkey for routine
check-up procedures were recruited as con-
trol subjects. Control subjects were required
to be free from major disease (including solid
cancers, haematological, renal and hepatic
diseases and rheumatological disorders).
Exclusion criteria for both patients and
control subjects were glaucoma, strabismus,
retinal disease, corneal abnormalities,
intraocular pressure >21 mmHg in either
eye, previous ophthalmic surgery or ocular
trauma, age-related macular degeneration,
myopia, hyperopia !3 diopters, use of ster-
oid or antiglaucoma drugs.
This study adhered to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved
by the ethics committee of Recep Tayyip
Erdogan University School of Medicine,
Rize, Turkey. All participants provided
written informed consent before being
included in the study.
Ophthalmic examination
A detailed ophthalmic examination
(including assessment of refractive error
and intraocular pressure, slit-lamp examin-
ation, and fundoscopy) was performed for
each study participant. All participants
underwent peripapillary RNFL thickness
measurement via CirrusÕ HD spectral-
domain OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin,
CA, USA). OCT was performed without
pupil dilatation and by a single investigator
(K.T.). Peripapillary RNFL thicknesses of
the temporal, nasal, inferior and superior
quadrants, as well as average RNFL thick-
ness, were assessed using an optic disc
200 Â 200 cube scan protocol. Cube average
thickness (CAT), central subfield thickness
(CST) and cube volume (CV) were mea-
sured. Scans with signal strength <8 and
those during which blinking occurred were
excluded from the study.
Laboratory analyses
Full blood count was determined using
standard methods and automated haema-
tology analyser (CELL-DYN Ruby; Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).
Serum iron and iron-binding capacity were
evaluated photometrically with an Architect
c16000 analyser (Abbott Laboratories)
and serum ferritin was assessed via chemi-
luminescent microparticle immunoassay
(Architect i2000; Abbott Laboratories).

Statistical analyses
Data were presented as meanÆSD.
Following Kolmogorov­Smirnov testing
for normality of distribution, between-
group comparisons were made using
Student's t-test or Mann­Whitney U-test,
as appropriate. Relationships between
RNFL thickness and serum haemoglobin,
iron and ferritin concentrations, total iron-
binding capacity and mean corpuscular
volume (MCV) in the patient and control
groups were assessed separately using
Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ, and P-values < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 40 female patients with
iron deficiency anaemia (mean age
38.8 Æ 9.2 years; age range 19­54 years)
and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy control
subjects (mean age 38.2 Æ 9.6 years; age
range 19­52 years). Clinical characteristics
of the patient and control groups are given
in Table 1. There were significant between-
group differences in haemoglobin, serum
iron and ferritin concentrations, MCV and
total iron-binding capacity (P < 0.001 for
each comparison; Table 1).
Data regarding OCT parameters are
shown in Table 2. RNFL thickness in both
the nasal and the inferior quadrants were
significantly thinner in the patient group
than in the control group (P ¼ 0.042 and
P ¼ 0.047, respectively). There were no other
statistically significant between-group
differences.
In the patient group, there were signifi-
cant positive correlations between inferior
RNFL thickness and Hb concentration
(r ¼ 0.221; P ¼ 0.049), and between nasal
RNFL thickness and serum iron (r ¼ 0.263;
P ¼ 0.018), total iron-binding capacity
(r ¼ 0.238; P ¼ 0.033) and serum ferritin
(r ¼ 0.284; P ¼ 0.011). There were no other
statistically significant correlations in the
patient group. There were no statistically
significant correlations between RNFL
thickness and any parameter in the control
group.

Discussion
The present study found that women with
iron deficiency anaemia had significantly
smaller RNFL thicknesses in the nasal and
inferior quadrants compared with healthy
matched subjects. In contrast, children with
iron deficiency anaemia have been found to
have lower average, superior and inferior
RNFL thicknesses compared with controls.7
A further study evaluating RNFL thick-
nesses in children with thalassaemia major
or iron deficiency anaemia showed that
RNFL thicknesses were decreased in all
quadrants in children with thalassemia
major, but in the inferior quadrant only in
children with iron deficiency anemia.8 The
inconsistencies between these studies and
our own may be a result of differences in the
study populations. It is possible that the
continuing development of the nervous
system in children may render their nerve
fibres more sensitive to changes in serum
iron concentrations.
It is well established that iron per-
forms important functions in the central
nervous system, including nerve myelination
and neurotransmitter synthesis.9
Oligodendrocytes are crucial for mye-
lination, and iron deficiency adversely
affects the normal functioning of these
cells.10 Iron affects myelin synthesis, both
directly as a cofactor of cholesterol and lipid
biosynthesis and indirectly as an oxidative
metabolism component in oligodendro-
cytes.11 The high iron and transferrin levels
present in newborns underline the import-
ance of iron in the development of the
nervous system.4 RNFL thicknesses in
anaemic women were correlated with Hb,
iron and ferritin concentrations as well as
with total iron-binding capacity in the pre-
sent study.
The reduced RNFL thickness in patients
with anaemia compared with control sub-
jects observed in the present study is likely
due to hypomyelination caused by iron
deficiency. Iron deficiency is known to play
an aetiological role in neurally-mediated
syncope and restless leg syndrome.12,13
Correction of anaemia led to improvements
in brain function independent of iron levels
in patients with anaemia unrelated to iron
deficiency, however.14,15 The decreased

RNFL thickness in children with thalassae-
mia major8 suggests that hypoxia may have
contributed to the reductions in RNFL
thickness seen in the present study. In
patients with sickle-cell disease, vascular
occlusions can lead to ischaemic retinop-
athy, and these patients have thinner peri-
papillary RNFL than healthy control
subjects.16 This may explain the correlation
between ischaemic status and peripapillary
RNFL thickness. Iron deficiency anaemia is
known to reduce spontaneous blinking rates
by triggering dopaminergic dysfunction.17
Since dopamine is the major retinal neuro-
transmitter,18 it would be logical to assume
that dopaminergic dysfunction was an add-
itional factor for the RNFL reductions
observed in our study.
Malnutrition and deficiencies in trace
elements (including iron, zinc and copper)
cause detrimental changes in the optic
nerve.4 Trace element status in iron defi-
ciency anaemia is mainly influenced by
metabolic interactions between these elem-
ents.19 Decreases in peripapillary RNFL
thickness may therefore be influenced by
deficiencies in other trace elements besides
iron.
The present study has several limitations.
The sample size was small and it was not
possible to subdivide groups according to
severity and duration of anaemia. In add-
ition, we did not re-evaluate peripapillary
RNFL thickness after iron supplementation
treatment.
The present study shows that iron defi-
ciency anaemia reduces RNFL thickness in
adult women. Further studies are necessary
to reveal the clinical importance of these
findings, and to determine whether these
changes could be reversed by treating the
anaemia.
