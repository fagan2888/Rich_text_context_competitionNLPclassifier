of the Course of Disability

Does religious involvement influence changes in physical health? We perform a longitudinal analysis of the effect
of religious participation on functioning over a 12-year follow-up period, in a large, prospective, representative
sample of elderly persons from New Haven, Connecticut, a religiously diverse community. To examine the possi-
bility that disability or changes in disability may be affecting religious involvement, we perform a second longitudi-
nal analysis of changes in religious practices. Finally, we ask whether psychosocial correlates explain the effect of
religious involvement on disability. Findings are (a) that attendance at services is a strong predictor of better func-
tioning, even when intermediate changes in functioning are included, (b) that health practices, social ties, and in-
dicators of well-being reduce, but do not eliminate these effects, and (c) that disability has minimal effects on sub-
sequent attendance. The findings illustrate the short- and long-term importance of religious participation to the
health and well-being of elderly people, and suggest a particular significance for religious participation in the lives
of disabled elders.
WHAT is known about the relationship between reli-
gion and health over time? One of the most common
findings in the sociology of religion is that attendance at
religious services declines in old age. Cross-sectional
(Ainlay, Singleton, and Swigert, 1992), retrospective (Bahr,
1970), longitudinal (Blazer and Palmore, 1976), and even
age-period-cohort analyses (Ploch and Hastings, 1994)
show that attendance at religious services declines among
elderly persons, beginning at about age 70.
Discussion of these findings assumes, or the data even
demonstrate (Ainlay, Singleton, and Swigert, 1992; Levin
and Markides, 1985), that the declining pattern is due to the
poorer health of the most aged respondents. The causal
model of the relationship between health and attendance at
religious services that underlies these studies is one in
which poor health precedes, and causes a decline in, reli-
gious observances. Such studies often conclude that mea-
surement of religious involvement in old age is incomplete
if it focuses solely on attendance at religious services, for
which a certain level of functional ability is presumably
necessary. The small study by Mindel and Vaughan (1978)
is cited so often because it was the first to distinguish be-
tween organizational (attendance at services) and nonorga-
nizational dimensions of religious practice (praying, listen-
ing to religious programs or music, etc.) and to show that
they were differentially associated with health impairment.
Somewhat at odds with this research tradition in the so-
ciology of religion is the increasingly substantial body of
work in religion and health which includes, but is not lim-
ited to, elderly populations. Recent reviews of research on
religion and physical and mental health have appeared in
Koenig (1995), a special issue of the Journal of Social
Issues (1995), and Levin (1994). While the majority of
studies in this field have been cross-sectional, and are thus
inconclusive with respect to causal direction, all find that
the evidence is relatively strong that mental and physical
health are better among sample subjects with current reli-
gious involvement. Our theoretical framework for the lon-
gitudinal analyses in this article draws on the classical
insights of Durkheim (1897 [1951]), Weber (1922 [1964]),
and James (1901-2 [1978]) and recent empirical work
(Dwyer, Clarke, and Miller, 1990; Idler and Kasl, 1992;
Koenig et al., 1992; Pressman et al., 1990) to argue that the
many dimensions of religion are beneficial for the many di-
mensions of human health, physical and mental. As the
classical sociological theorists understood a century ago,
religious groups regulate and integrate the individuals who
make them up, and offer a view of life that may be particu-
larly comforting in old age. The results in the first article
provided solid empirical support for this theoretical posi-
tion. As we argued and demonstrated in the first of these
two articles, elderly people who attend religious services
take better care of themselves in the sense of several pre-
ventive practices, they have more opportunities for socializ-
ing with family and friends, and they have a more positive,
optimistic outlook on life.
We would also trace the intellectual lineage of the sec-
ond of these articles to the large population studies of so-
cial networks and mortality that began to appear in the late
1970s (Berkman and Syme, 1979; House, Robbins, and
Metzner, 1982; Idler and Kasl, 1990; Schoenbach et al.,
1986). None of these studies had a focus on religion, but all
of them included at least one item on attendance or mem-
bership; membership in religious groups was treated con-
ceptually as a form of social network tie. In each study, re-
ligious attendance or membership was an independent
S306
RELIGION AND THE DISABLED II S307
predictor of mortality from all causes, although not always
in all gender and race subgroups. The study undertaken
here has a similar design in that it is a large, prospective
study of a representative sample with extensive health sta-
tus data at baseline and follow-up, and also with somewhat
limited measures of religious involvement.
Four other studies are particularly relevant to the present
effort. The first use of the religious involvement items later
employed in the New Haven Established Populations for
the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) sample
was a study by Zuckerman, Kasl, and Ostfeld (1984),
which showed lower mortality rates among religious el-
derly persons in poor health when they were compared with
others who were less devout. Colantonio, Kasl, and Ostfeld
(1992) showed, in the same EPESE sample employed here,
that religious involvement was associated with lower in-
cidence of stroke, but this association disappeared when
additional predictor variables were considered. Our 1992
study (Idler and Kasl, 1992) of the same population showed
that public religious involvement had an effect on both
functioning and depression up to three years later. Most re-
cently, similar measures of religious involvement were used
by Oxman, Freeman, and Manheimer (1995) in a study
which showed that cardiac patients who felt they received
no strength and comfort from religion had a higher risk of
death in the 6 months following surgery than those who did
perceive such comfort.
Hypothesis 1: Religious involvement will be associated with
better functioning over time when initial levels of function-
ing are held constant.
Notwithstanding our theoretical framework, we do not
wish to disregard the plausible and empirically demon-
strated pattern of disability's effect on subsequent atten-
dance at religious services. Thus, in the first article, we ex-
amined the 1982 health and disability status determinants
of both attendance and subjective religiousness. Our find-
ings (in Table 2 of that article) were that attendance at ser-
vices was strongly associated cross-sectionally with lower
levels of disability, and conversely, that subjective religious
feelings were weakly associated with higher levels of dis-
ability. These two views, often referred to as causation vs
selection, are not mutually exclusive. Evidence supporting
both causal directions could be found in longitudinal obser-
vational data; it would be evidence that the relationship be-
tween religion and health is layered with complexity and
may evolve over time in people's lives. One way of ad-
dressing these issues is by looking at change in religious in-
volvement over time; another way is by differentiating or-
ganizational and nonorganizational aspects of religious
involvement. Selection effects may keep disabled people
from attending services, but they should have no diminish-
ing effect on subjective feelings of religiousness.
Hypothesis 2: Disability will be associated with short-term,
but not long-term, declines in attendance at religious services.
We have chosen functional ability as our outcome mea-
sure, rather than disease-specific morbidity criteria, for
several reasons. Conveniently, annual follow-ups were
available; measuring changes in functioning was a central
goal of the EPESE studies. The design of the EPESE stud-
ies has proven to be foresighted; these measures are as-
suming an acknowledged role as summary measures of
health status in older populations in that they capture the
cumulative effects of pathologies, impairments, and their
comorbid interactions with each other (Pope and Tarlov,
1991; Verbrugge and Jette, 1994). Studies of change in
functioning over time in population samples are appearing
with increasing frequency, from the Alameda County
Study (Strawbridge et al., 1992), the National Long-Term
Care Surveys (Boaz, 1994; Manton, Corder, and Stallard,
1993), the Longitudinal Retirement History Study (Mad-
dox and Clark, 1992), the Longitudinal Study of Aging
(Crimmins and Saito, 1993), and the EPESE studies
(Guralnik et al., 1993). Two findings from these studies are
important for our study design. First, most find that, de-
spite a general downward trend in functioning for elderly
samples followed over time, there are significant minori-
ties that improve in functioning (Boaz, 1994; Crimmins
and Saito, 1993; Strawbridge et al., 1992). Second, pat-
terns of functional disability vary for many subgroups in
the population, both in baseline levels and in change over
time (Crimmins and Saito, 1993; Maddox and Clark, 1992;
Strawbridge et al., 1992). These findings suggest that mul-
tiple endpoints over a long follow-up period would be the
most sensitive to change -- which could be improvement
one year, and deterioration the next. They also underscore
the importance of taking baseline measures into account,
and of carefully examining relationships within subgroups.
Both of these observations are critical to our focus on
baseline-disabled elderly persons.
Few of these studies have included psychosocial vari-
ables, or even health practices (LaCroix et al., 1993, is an
exception), as predictors of change in functioning. How-
ever, given the now generally accepted role that social ties
play in predicting mortality (House, Landis, and Umberson,
1988), it would appear fruitful, from the point of view of
disability research, to pursue these ideas. Our central hy-
pothesis for this study is that religious involvement, which
promotes individual well-being through regulation, integra-
tion, and the provision of meaning, will be positively asso-
ciated with better functional ability over 12 years, even
when baseline functioning and health status are taken
into account.
While we were interested in examining findings for spe-
cific subgroups, our intent was more to confirm the overall
findings in these subgroups than to search for differences.
Both levels of functioning and levels of religiousness could
be expected to differ among men and women, Whites and
Blacks, the young-old and the oldest-old, and Protestants,
Roman Catholics, and Jews; however, we hypothesize a
general effect within the sample and do not expect to see
differences by subgroup, with the exception of the group
which already had some measurable disability at the start of
the study. While much of the literature appears to presume
that disabled elderly people are often unable to attend wor-
ship services, our findings in the cross-sectional analyses
were that disabled elderly persons who did attend services
had substantial benefits. Because some of these benefits --
in the form of more social ties and higher levels of well-
S308 IDLER AND KASL
being -- accrued especially to the disabled respondents in
the sample, our third hypothesis is that there will be stronger
effects of religious attendance on disability for those who al-
ready have some loss of functioning at the start of the study.
Hypothesis 3: There will be stronger beneficial effects of
religious attendance on subsequent disability for those who
already have some disability at baseline (interaction effect).
Our three remaining hypotheses could contribute to our
understanding of mechanisms in the religion-health rela-
tionship. First, we theorized in the first article that religious
groups control the behavior of their members. We found
empirically that greater attendance at religious services was
indeed associated with higher levels of physical activity,
less alcohol use, and a greater likelihood of never having
smoked. These baseline correlations could be taken as evi-
dence of confounding in the relationship: If poorer health
practices have already resulted in poorer health status, then
absence from services could simply be a function of both of
these. On the other hand, the alternate causal arguments are
that better lifelong health habits promoted by religious
groups could preserve health in old age (primary preven-
tion), or that religious groups could provide assistance and
social support to those changing habits of alcohol consump-
tion, for example (secondary prevention). Our data do not
allow us to disentangle those relationships that evolved dur-
ing adulthood and middle age; we can only adjust for these
factors at baseline and look at their relationships prospec-
tively. This said, Hypothesis 4 is that we expect better
health practices among the religiously-involved to explain
part of the effect of religiousness on functioning.
Hypothesis 4: Some of the effect of religious attendance
on functioning will be explained by the better health prac-
tices of thefrequent attenders.
Hypothesis 5 is that supportive, integrating social ties,
which are also strongly associated with religious atten-
dance, and to a lesser degree, subjective religiousness,
will partly explain the effect of religiousness on function-
ing. The higher levels of social engagement in daily ac-
tivities and yearly holiday celebrations of the religiously-
active, and their greater density and intensity of kinship
and friendship networks, act as barriers against social iso-
lation and loneliness. Like the health practices, their role
could be one of primary prevention or secondary preven-
tion, or both.
Hypothesis 5: Some of the effect of religious attendance on
functioning will be explained by the larger and more active
social networks offrequent attenders.
Hypothesis 6 is that higher levels of well-being among
the actively-religious will also be partly explanatory. We
saw that attendance at religious services was associated
negatively with most of the components of depressive feel-
ings, and positively with optimism, and again the associa-
tion was particularly strong among the currently disabled.
If religious group participation acts to maintain feelings of
hope, and reduces enervating sadness, it may facilitate re-
covery by giving the disabled participant more motivation
for rehabilitation and return to full functioning.
Hypothesis 6: Some of the effect of religious attendance on
functioning will be explained by the higher levels of well-
being of thefrequent attenders.
In sum, the hypotheses predict a strong longitudinal as-
sociation between greater religious involvement at the in-
ception of the study, and better functional ability measured
repeatedly during the course of the follow-up. We expect
this association to be pronounced among, but not limited to,
the already-disabled, and we expect that the greater re-
sources of the religiously-active, i.e., their better health
practices, more extensive social ties, and higher levels of
subjective well-being, will partially explain the effect.
METHOD
Sample and Study Design
The New Haven site of the EPESE project has been de-
scribed in detail in other publications (Cornoni-Huntley et
al., 1986) and in the preceding article. Our additional de-
scription here emphasizes the longitudinal aspects of the
design. Annual interviews were conducted by telephone or
in person from 1982 to 1989; a final in-person interview
was conducted in 1994. Response rates for 1983 through
1988 averaged 95 percent; for 1994 the figure is 91 percent
(942 completed interviews out of 1,037 sample members
not known to be deceased). Less than 1 percent of the sur-
viving sample was not traced for the 1994 follow-up. For
this longitudinal analysis, we use the annual measures of
functioning, creating multiple endpoints for 1983 through
1988, and for 1994. Functional disability data could be pro-
vided by respondents or their proxies. Attrition due almost
entirely to mortality causes the sample size with complete
data for the dependent variable to decline annually to N =
1,621 by 1988, and to N = 922 by 1994. This is a prospec-
tive study of a heterogeneous sample with close follow-up
over an extended period, high response rates, and multiple
measures of health status.
Cross-tabulations of survival status at the time of the
1994 follow-up show that attrition from the sample came
primarily from groups one would expect to have a higher
risk of mortality: the one-third of the sample with the high-
est disability scores, those aged 75 and older, and males.
For each of these tables (not shown), Mantel-Haenszel chi
squares had p-values of less than .001. There were no dif-
ferences in mortality by religious affiliation; Catholics,
Protestants, Jews, and others all had approximately equal
risk. Frequent attendance at services in 1982 was strongly
associated with lower mortality by 1994 (M-H x2 P < -001),
but subjective religiousness was not (M-H \2 P = -376).
These bivariate, unadjusted associations tell us that losses
to the sample will come primarily from the most disabled,
but also that our primary independent variable (attendance
at services) is associated with retention in the sample.
Measures
Functional disability. -- The construction of the 1982
scale has been previously described. We created additional
scales for all years of follow-up with identical methods.
RELIGION AND THE DISABLED II S309
Characteristics of these scales are shown in Table 1. Means
for the seven years of follow-up range from just over 20, to
almost 42, out of a possible maximum of 150. Cronbach's
alphas for the 15-item measures range from .91 to .95.
Proxies provided some reports of disability; hence, the
sample sizes are larger for the disability measures than for
the religiousness measures. The 1994 disability measures
have the largest number of proxies reporting (13.5%).
Other variables. -- All other variables in the analysis are
scored as in the preceding article. We have included in Table
1 descriptive statistics for the later measures of religious in-
volvement, available in the 1985, 1988, and 1994 interviews.
The items in those years were identical to those in 1982.
Analysis
As in the preceding article, all multivariate regression anal-
yses were performed with SUDAAN to adjust for the com-
plex, stratified, and clustered nature of the study design. First,
we regressed each of the 1983-1994 disability measures on
religious involvement, disability, the set of health status co-
variates, and demographic factors from the 1982 survey. We
then examined the alternative causal process by regressing the
follow-up religion measures on the same set of independent
variables. Returning to the analysis of follow-up disability as
the dependent variable, we tested a series of interactions be-
tween attendance and a number of important characteristics,
including sex, age, denomination and, particularly, baseline
disability. Then we asked if any of the behavioral or psy-
chosocial correlates of religious involvement in 1982 might
help explain any of its effect on disability. As a final step, we
examined post-baseline change in disability by introducing
later measures of disability as covariates. All coefficients re-
ported in Tables 2 to 6 are unstandardized; they can be inter-
preted directly as units of change in the dependent variable at-
tributable to one unit of change in the independent variable.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows that mean functioning levels decline over
the period; the average score more than doubles. Indeed,
there is a linear increase in scores from one year to the next.
This finding is in agreement with other longitudinal studies
of functioning (Maddox and Clark, 1992; Strawbridge et
al., 1992). The standard deviations in Table 1, however, re-
flect a great deal of individual variation in scores in the
sample, and these increase over time.
Table 1 also shows the bivariate relationships between
disability values for each of the years of the study, and
the baseline measures of religious involvement.
Attendance at services in 1982 is consistently and nega-
tively associated with disability over the follow-up pe-
riod; subjective religiousness has no significant associa-
tion. The association with attendance declines over the
period as the measures become more distant from each
other; nevertheless, attendance in 1982 is still signifi-
cantly correlated with lower levels of disability 12 years
later.
The table also shows that 1982 attendance and subjec-
tive religiousness are well correlated with the later mea-
sures of the same concepts. The bivariate correlations of
.43 to .60 for the measure of attendance at services, and
.61 to .63 for the measure of subjective religiousness, sug-
gest moderate stability in religious practices and beliefs.
Despite the attrition in the sample due to mortality, and the
previously noted increasing levels of disability among sur-
vivors, 40 percent of the sample report attending services
once a week or more often in 1982, 1985, and 1988, and
this figure drops only to 38 percent in 1994. It is interest-
ing that the decline in functioning in the sample is steeper
than the decline in attendance, suggesting that in older age
a particular level of disability may diminish somewhat as a
barrier to attendance.

Does religious involvement have an effect on subsequent
functional disability? (Hypothesis 1)
Our analysis in Table 2 takes each annual measure of dis-
ability as its dependent variable. Disability in 1982 is in-
cluded in each model to partial out the level of functioning
at the start of the study; it is highly correlated with disabil-
ity levels in each of the following years. As Table 2 shows,
attendance at religious services is strongly associated with
changes in disability that take place through the follow-up
period. The associations are statistically significant through
1988, and although the size of the coefficient does not
change much by 1994 (in fact, it is just about the average
for the preceding years), the coefficient no longer reaches
statistical significance. Note that until 1988, the association
actually appears to grow in strength as the follow-up period
lengthens. Subjective religiousness, on the other hand, is
not significantly related to disability levels in any year, and
the coefficients vary a good deal. The affiliation categories
also were tested in these models, with Roman Catholics the
reference category; as in the attrition analyses, no signifi-
cant effects were found (in any year), and these models are
presented without them.
With respect to the other variables, many of the health
status measures are associated with change in disability; the
models, which originally included all health status measures
in Table 1 of the preceding article, have been trimmed to in-
clude just those that are significantly associated with disabil-
ity in one or more years of follow-up. Stroke victims (those
with remaining difficulties), diabetics (those on medication),
respondents reporting amputations of the leg, those report-
ing symptoms of congestive heart failure or angina, and
those with impaired cognitive function all have poorer func-
tional ability during at least some period of the follow-up.
Broken bones (since age 50) in 1982 are associated with im-
provements in functioning, an unusual association that has
been noted in these data before (Idler and Kasl, 1992).
The demographic factors show expected associations.
Age is related to increasing disability over the period, as is
being female. In several of the follow-up years, higher lev-
els of education are related to lower disability, as is being
married. Neither race nor low income is related to disability
in any year of follow-up.
The sizes of the regression coefficients for religious atten-
dance and their associated significance levels do not diminish,
but vary somewhat without an obvious trend. The one excep-
tion is the coefficient for 1994, which is no longer significant.
Overall, in the full sample, we see a persistent relationship of
religious attendance, but not subjective religiousness, to better
functioning that appears to last for at least 6 years.

RELIGION AND THE DISABLED II S311
some years, we were able to evaluate the reverse causal
model, for changes in attendance that took place from 1982
to 1985, 1988, and 1994. As with the analysis of disability,
we include the baseline measure of attendance in all models
to account for differences existing at baseline. As Table 3
shows, functional disability in 1982 is not related to change
in attendance in any of the years, once baseline levels of at-
tendance, other measures of health status, and sociodemo-
graphics are controlled. As the waves of data measuring re-
ligion were 3 years apart, we wondered if this was not too
long a period for an effect to be detected; we then added
additional measures of disability for the year just prior to
the religion measure, and here we do see effects. Disability
does appear to have a strongly significant short-term nega-
tive effect on attendance, but it is one that cannot be de-
tected 3 years later. We would also note that the addition of
these post-baseline disability measures adds little or noth-
ing to the R2 for these models.
With respect to the other variables in the model, by far the
largest effects are from previous levels of attendance, as one
would anticipate from the high correlations between waves
in Table 1. Subjective religiousness also has strong effects
throughout the follow-up period. The few other variables
that have an effect are: an inexplicable positive effect of
non-leg amputations; a negative effect of age (note that this
is independent of disability); race (Whites are less likely
than Blacks to be attending by the end of the period); and
education (a consistently positive effect). Overall, it appears
that later attendance patterns in the sample are primarily ex-
plained by previous attendance patterns and subjective reli-
giousness and only fleetingly by changes in disability.
We also conducted a longitudinal analysis of change in
subjective religiousness (not shown). The results were simi-
lar to Table 3, in that both attendance and subjective feelings
were the strongest predictors of later feelings, but they were
dissimilar in that 1982 disability had small but significant
effects on higher levels of religious feeling in 1988 and
1994. Interim measures of disability had no effect. Together,
these results underscore the differences between attendance
and subjective religiousness, but they provide little or no
support for the reverse causal model. We conclude that,
while the effect of new disability on declining attendance is
detectable, it is overshadowed by the consistency, size, and
significance of the evidence in the other direction.
Is the effect of attendance on disability a general one in the
population studied or is it limited to certain subgroups?
(Hypothesis 3)
To evaluate the possibility that the effects may be concen-
trated in a particular subgroup, we tested models with interac-

tion effects for attendance by sex, affiliation (White
Protestants vs all others), age (continuous), and baseline dis-
ability (continuous). We also tested main effect models in the
subset of the sample who survived to 1988. Our tests showed
no significant effects for interactions of attendance with sex,
affiliation, or age, but they did show associations that were
significant or borderline significant for 4 of the 7 years of fol-
low-up for the disability interaction. In Table 4 we illustrate
these findings with a stratified analysis for three equal-sized
disability groups. The first group, with disability scores of 0,
shows effects in just 2 years; these effects must represent pre-
vention of decline for attenders, because their condition could
not improve. The group with moderate disability (scores of 1
to 21) shows effects in 4 of 7 years, and a notably strong ef-
fect for 1994. The most disabled group (with scores of 22 to
150) has the largest coefficients and strongest significance
levels of the three groups. The results provide support for
Hypothesis 3, that the effects of attendance on subsequent dis-
ability will be greater for those with some existing disability,
although the effects are not absent in any group.
Table 4 also shows the subgroup of 1988 survivors. They
echo the bivariate findings we presented in the attrition
analyses. Although just over half of the sample survives to
1988, we see a persistent effect among this subset of the
sample, with relatively large coefficients.
Do any of the behavioral or psychosocial factors associ-
ated with religiousness explain its effect on disability?
(Hypotheses 4,5,6)
Table 5 tests Hypotheses 4, 5, and 6. In an intermediate
step, we tested each of the health practice, social activities,
and well-being measures that were significantly associated
with either of the religion measures in Tables 2, 3, and 4
(preceding article), one by one as independent variables in
the full models. Our reasoning was that only variables that
were associated with religiousness at Time 1 could serve as
explanatory variables. Of course, this criterion did not
shrink our pool of candidate mediating variables by very
much; only self-rated health and negative affect were
clearly not associated with either indicator of religiousness.
We found that physical activities, leisure activities, close
friends, friend contact, close kin, kin contact, interpersonal
distress, and optimism were all associated with disability in
the longitudinal models. Because we wanted to combine
these factors to test the hypotheses, and because the two
pairs of social contact/closeness variables were highly cor-
related with each other, we chose to use only the friend and
kin closeness measures, rather than the contact measures,
which had had weaker effects.
The three hypotheses are tested separately and then in a
combined model. The results are abridged to show just the
coefficients for religiousness and the candidate mediating
variables; they can be compared directly to the first two
lines of Table 2 (this article). The test of the health practices
hypothesis contains only the measure of physical activity,
as alcohol use, obesity, and smoking were not related to
follow-up disability. Physical activity has lasting effects
that remain strong throughout the period, even until 1994. It
also consistently reduces the size of the coefficients for reli-
gious attendance, but by minimal amounts, usually less

than 10 percent. Thus, a modest amount of the variance in
disability initially explained by attendance at religious ser-
vices is due to the higher levels of physical activity of fre-
quent attenders, providing some support for Hypothesis 4.
Certainly physical activity is a strong predictor of better
functioning over the long run.
Close friends and kin, and leisure activities, in combina-
tion, provide a test of Hypothesis 5. Leisure social activities
in 1982 are a strong predictor of functioning during the pe-
riod, and number of close kin is to a lesser extent. Number
of close friends has no main effect. Activities and kin re-
duce the size of the attendance coefficients somewhat, by as
much as 30 percent, and for 1984 and 1986 the effect loses
significance. Thus, we can say that the better functional
ability of the more religious respondents is to some extent
due to their higher levels of activity overall, and their larger
and closer family, but not friendship, networks. Never-
theless, a significant effect of religiousness remains, even
after social activities have been considered.
Hypothesis 6 is that better well-being among the
religiously-active will partly explain their better function-
ing. Optimism and the CES-D scale were the only two
well-being indicators that were associated with religious-
ness, and also predicted change in functioning. When intro-
duced together, only optimism is significantly associated
with later functioning, in both the short-term and the long-
term. It adds 2 percent to the R2 for 1994, but changes the
coefficients for religious attendance very little. While opti-
mism is clearly a predictor of better functioning, it does lit-
tle to help explain the effect of religiousness.
As a final step, we introduced all the mediating variables
that had been significant in the three hypothesis-testing
models, to see if together they would eliminate the effect of
religiousness. These results are shown in the bottom panel.
Coefficients for religiousness are reduced in all years, and
effects become nonsignificant in two years, marginal in an-
other one. However, some robust effects remain through
1988. Thus, while we successfully identify some of the
mechanisms of attendance at worship services, the higher
associated levels of physical and leisure activities, close
kin, and optimism do not eliminate the effect of religious
attendance on disability.
Do the effects persist even after adjusting for post-baseline
changes in functioning?
Finally, we were interested in the persistence of the ef-
fects of attendance in a different way from that seen in
Table 2. Specifically, we wondered whether introducing
post-baseline measures of disability would eliminate the ef-
fect of attendance on disability in the years following. Table
6 shows all possible combinations of intermediate measures
and later follow-ups. Again, these coefficients are abridged
S314 IDLER AND KASL
from the complete models, given in Table 2. The first panel
shows results for all later years when 1983 disability re-
places 1982 disability in the model. The significant, even
larger, coefficients for attendance tell us that 1982 reli-
giousness continues to have an effect on changes in disabil-
ity that take place between 1983 and 1984, and between
1983 and 1985, etc., and even marginally between 1983 and
1994. This is remarkable, in that the post-1982 levels of
disability are themselves influenced by baseline attendance,
and yet our analysis controls for this influence. The second,
third, fourth, and fifth panels tell us that the effect persists
when we move the starting time for change, even to change
that occurs between 1987 and 1988. Significant effects do
not persist into 1994, although again the size of the coeffi-
cients does not decline much. These very consistent find-
ings were something of a surprise. Our interpretation rests
on the fact that religious attendance is relatively stable over
the period, especially through 1988, as we saw in Table 1.
The sample size shrinks every year due to mortality, aver-
age disability levels of the survivors increase, and yet a vir-
tually constant proportion are attending services once a
week. It appears as if religious attendance has defined a tra-
jectory that is consistent when viewed from many windows.
DISCUSSION
Could Social Selection Explain These Findings?
Many of the studies in the field of religion, health, and
aging that find better health associated with religious practices
have been open to the interpretation that elderly people who
have fewer disabilities and better health are simply able to
continue attending services or, in other words, that selection,
and not causation, is responsible for the association. As we
noted in the beginning of the first article, we intended to make
an argument that religious involvement precedes changes in
health and functioning and that this is compatible with a
causal interpretation of the role of religious involvement.
The primary finding of the study is that attendance at re-
ligious services has long-term effects on functioning that
persist strongly through 1988 and are reduced in signifi-
cance, if not size, by 1994. The models in Table 2 contain
the baseline level of the respondent's functioning, sociode-
mographic characteristics known to be associated with
change in functioning, and a quite extensive set of health
status covariates which might be expected to cause deterio-
rating function in the future. Thus, these are causal models
that consider numerous possible confounders, and this is
one argument against the possibility that it is selection, and
not causation, at work. Our longitudinal models take not
only current levels of disability into account, but also the
existence of conditions and symptoms, as well as the more
or less advantaged social locations of respondents.
A second argument in favor of causation is that we tested
the selection scenario straight-on, and found small, short-
term effects only. New disability that was measured at the
immediately prior round of interviews (one year prior), and
reflected change since the baseline, did have a negative ef-
fect on later attendance at services, but 1982 disability had
no effect on any attendance measure, including 1983 atten-
dance. One might argue that the effects we did see would
have been stronger if we had had measures for disability
that came even closer to the measurement of attendance,
but this is at most an argument for short-term selection, and
the long-term picture in Table 3 is clear.
The third finding underscoring the causal interpretation
was presented in Table 6, which showed that, even when in-
termediate changes are removed from the model, atten-
dance continues to predict later changes. The focus on the

later periods of change, which are in effect detached from
the baseline, sharpens the time order of attendance and
change in disability.
Are Behavioral or Psychosocial Characteristics the Causal
Pathway?
The first of these two articles demonstrated quite dramati-
cally that attendance at religious services is linked to a broad
array of positive health behaviors, and social and psycholog-
ical resources, many of which could be considered causal
pathways. Overall, our results suggest that they explain
some but not all of the effect. The combination of activities,
close family relationships, and optimism does reduce the ef-
fect of religious attendance in the short term. We might say
that the effects of religious attendance in the early follow-up
period are largely due to the greater optimism and higher
levels of leisure activities of the religious attenders.
However, even when these factors are included in the mod-
els, a significant effect of religious attendance reappears in
1985, after which the effects of leisure activities and opti-
mism are marginal at most. Physical activity, and to a lesser
extent, family closeness, remain predictors of disability
throughout the follow-up, but the effects of attendance per-
sist as well until 1988, so we cannot entirely attribute the ef-
fect of religious activities to physical activity or family ties,
either. Our conclusion is that attendance at religious services
plays an independent role in predicting the course of disabil-
ity that is not accounted for by prior disability or health sta-
tus, or by the differing participation rates of various demo-
graphic or religious groups, or by better health practices, or
by the substantial group of psychosocial factors with which
religious involvement is clearly associated.
Limitations
This study has the strengths and the weaknesses of an
analysis of a large, regional longitudinal data set. It al-
lows us to establish time order, to measure health status
and disability with considerable detail, and to generalize
to the population of the area from which it comes.
However, it has a number of limitations related to sam-
pling, measurement, and analysis. First, it has rather few
indicators of religious involvement, and for this analysis
we have primarily relied on a single item indicator of a
single construct, the organizational aspects of religious-
ness. Moreover, it relies on data from a single commu-
nity, a small metropolitan area in the northeastern United
States, whose respondents are diverse with respect to
Roman Catholics, Jews, and African Americans, but
which had few elderly Hispanic or Asian Americans. A
third limitation is the age restriction: All respondents
were 65 or older in 1982, and thus represent cohorts
whose lifelong religious experiences stretch back into an
earlier era. These findings provide us with little basis for
generalizing to more recent cohorts or other parts of the
country, or for speculating about other dimensions of reli-
gious experience which might play a role. Finally, we
have taken a relatively simple approach to modeling;
more sophisticated approaches such as reciprocal effects
modeling or structural equation modeling could perhaps

Conclusions
Religion is a very important aspect of many elderly peo-
ple's lives, although it is often ignored in gerontological re-
search. National data show that elderly people are highly
likely to say religion is "very important" in their life (76%),
compared with just 44 percent of those under 30 (Princeton
Religion Research Center, 1994). Our findings from the
first article showed that, particularly for disabled respon-
dents, religious attendance appeared to be a kind of lynch-
pin that connected observant respondents to other networks
of friends and relatives, to holiday celebrations, and to
other social and cultural activities. It is not a scarce re-
source, but a widely available one in this community, and it
is all the more important because it appears to make other
resources available.
Our focus on religion in the lives of disabled elderly per-
sons has been a fortuitous one in several respects. Two-
thirds of the sample reported some amount of difficulty
with at least one disability item, so the disabled represent a
majority of the sample. In the first article, we saw that reli-
gious attendance made a special difference for this group in
terms of social activities and well-being. And in this article
we saw somewhat stronger prospective effects of religious
attendance on disability for the already-disabled. The latter
finding strengthens the causal interpretation of the data, and
the first article directs our attention in certain ways as we
think about the mechanisms of causation. Future work in
this field might profitably focus on the meaning of religious
involvement for disabled elderly persons, particularly the
manifold dimensions of the experience of attendance at re-
ligious services. Worshipping together with the religious
congregation may offer the disabled elderly person a route,
through prayer, or receiving the sacraments, or appreciation
of the beauty of the place, to a transcendent state in which
the body and its frailties don't matter that much. The moti-
vation to return to this state, and to the accompanying so-
cial support and pleasant pastimes that religious groups
provide, may be a strong factor influencing the recovery of
elderly people with new disabilities. In any event, our find-
ings tell us that future work in this field should not neglect
the role of traditional, organizational religion in favor of
nonorganizational or subjective dimensions of religion.
We began our two articles with a question about how the
lives of religious and nonreligious elderly people differed.
We found in the first report that they differed with respect
to almost everything we looked at, including physical activ-
ity, smoking, alcohol use, friendship and family ties, social
activities and holiday celebrations, depression, and opti-
mism. In every instance those who attended services more
also did better in these other areas. Now we can add that at-
tendance at services presages better disability outcomes as
well, partly because of these corollary benefits, but also be-
cause of something which is apparently unique to the
experience of attendance at religious services. Religious in-
volvement appears to invigorate everyday life in the pres-
ent, and to be a source of help for troubles in the future.
The abundance of this resource in American communities,
its overwhelming importance to the majority of current co-
horts of elderly persons in the U.S., and its apparent effects
on a fundamental measure of functioning in daily life

should make it incumbent upon gerontologists to turn their
attention to this often-overlooked aspect of the lives of el-
derly people.
