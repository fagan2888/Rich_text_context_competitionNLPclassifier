Introduction
About one third of the independently living elderly aged 65
years and above fall at least once a year (Gill, Taylor, &
Pengelly, 2005; Gillespie et al., 2012). Studies have identi-
fied multiple risk factors (Rubenstein, 2006). Physical limi-
tations, such as visual impairments, hearing disabilities, and
difficulties with performing activities of daily living (ADL),
are possible risk factors for falling accidents (Sai, Gallagher,
Smith, & Logsdon, 2010; Stalenhoef, Diederiks, Knottnerus,
Kester, & Crebolder, 2002; Tromp et al., 2001; Yokoya,
Demura, & Sato, 2007). There are multiple fall risk factors
related to mental health, including fear of falling. This is an
important predictor for falls: Older people who are afraid of
falling are more likely to fall, while those who fell in the past
have a significantly higher level of fear (Pluijm et al., 2006).
Furthermore, common mental conditions among the elderly
(such as depression) may cause an increase in instability (Turcu
et al., 2004) and a higher risk of falling (Sai et al., 2010;
Stalenhoef et al., 2002). Although studies on lifestyle-related
risk factors present different results, there is clear evidence that
insufficient physical activity and the use of sedatives and tran-
quilizers increase the risk of falling accidents (Askari et al.,
2013; Evans, 2003). With regard to alcohol use, the magni-
tude of the associated risk of fall accidents among older
adults is uncertain. Many studies found no association
between increased alcohol use and falls, whereas others
reported a higher risk when consuming more than the
"acceptable" alcohol standard (Reid, Boutros, O'Connor,
Cadariu, & Concato, 2002). The relationship between smok-
ing and falling accidents has hardly been studied.
Besides the above-mentioned risk factors, another aspect
associated with an increased risk of fall accidents to be taken
into account is fall history. Recurrent fallers are often older
and frailer because of comorbidity and/or other risk factors.
This group is considered a high-risk group that needs more
stringent follow-up than those without fall history and may
benefit most from targeted treatment. In addition, specific

Gender Differences in Risk Factors for
Single and Recurrent Falls Among the
Community-Dwelling Elderly
Yu Mei O1 and Fatima El Fakiri1
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to identify gender differences in risk factors of fall accidents among older people, and whether
these factors differ between single and recurrent fallers. A total of 4,426 individuals aged 65 years from two large-scale
health surveys provided data. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors and to determine the risk model
for falling and recurrent falling in men and women separately. Three major risk factors for falling regardless of gender or fall
history are fear of falling, limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), and age 75 years. Fear of falling remains one of the
common modifiable risk factors. Among those without a fall history, the use of sedatives or tranquilizers increases the risk of
falling. Regarding gender differences, ADL limitations and fear of falling appear to be stronger fall risk factors for men than for
women. Among women, alcohol use and educational level are significant risk factors for falling, while loneliness is associated
with recurrent falling. Men with fear of falling or ADL limitations are at higher risk to have a recurrent fall accident than
women with these conditions. Having a visual impairment or living with someone is associated with recurrent falling among
men. Our findings emphasize the importance of multifactorial fall interventions, taking into account a variety of subgroup
characteristics such as gender and fall history.

characteristics of the subgroup such as gender may be rele-
vant risk factors of falling. Fear of falling is more common in
women than in men (Lach, 2005; Yamashita, Noe, & Bailer,
2012). With aging, hearing sensitivity declines more than
twice as fast in men compared with women. Also, a low body
mass index (BMI) is associated with hip fractures only among
older women (Bernstein, Grisso, & Kaplan, 1999). Despite
considerable research in this field, there is no consensus
regarding the main independent risk factors. Intervention pro-
grams should focus on these factors to prevent (recurrent)
falls among the elderly. Although not all fall accidents can be
prevented, it may be possible to mitigate the risk factors.
Risk factors for falls can be divided into modifiable and
unmodifiable ones, but only modifiable risk factors can be
targeted by preventive interventions to reduce fall risk in the
future. Taking into account the severity of the problem and
the need to tailor intervention strategies, possible risk factors
related to falls among older men and women should be exam-
ined separately and whether there are differences in risk fac-
tors for single and recurrent fallers need to be investigated.
Many studies on falling accidents among the elderly focus
only on a few risk factors, have a small study population,
and/or focus on elderly living in nursing care facilities and
hospitals. Our study is unique in that we explore gender dif-
ferences in falling accidents in relation to multiple different
risk factors within one large population.
The aim of this study is to provide more insight into the
relation between the most common risk factors and falling
among a representative sample of community-dwelling
elderly who participated in the Health Monitor in 2008 and
2010 (two large-scale health surveys among adult inhabit-
ants of Amsterdam and its surroundings).The acquired data
can be used to better tailor interventions in specific groups.
The following research questions are addressed:
Research Question 1: Which individual factors are
related to fall accidents among older men and women?
Research Question 2: Are there differences in fall risk
factors between single fallers and recurrent fallers?
Design and Method
Sample Selection
The Public Health Service of Amsterdam conducts periodic
large-scale health surveys to gain insight into the determi-
nants of the health of citizens of Amsterdam and its sur-
roundings. There were two large-scale surveys of interest:
the Amsterdam Health Monitor 2008 of the city of
Amsterdam, and the Health Monitor 2010 of the surround-
ings Amstelland and Diemen consisting of the five small
municipalities Aalsmeer, Amstelveen, Ouder-Amstel,
Uithoorn, and Diemen (for more information, see Dijkshoorn,
El Fakiri, Janssen, Ujcic-Voortman, & Verhagen, 2009 and
http://www.ggd.amsterdam.nl/beleid-onderzoek/gezond-
heidsmonitors/gezondheidsmonitor).
The design was according to the stratified design and
weighting in Dutch regional health surveys (Uitenbroek, 2009;
for English translation, see http://www.quantitativeskills.com/
sisa/papers/paper7.htm). Independently living participants
were drawn from the population registry, divided in groups
according to gender, age, and neighborhood. Each stratum
consisted of 200 participants in the city of Amsterdam
(GMA, 2008) and 250 in the surroundings, respectively.
More participants were drawn in strata with expected low
response. The resulting total numbers of correctly completed
questionnaires were weighted with respect to the response
and total population in these groups.
The resulting total data were as follows: AGM 2008 (n =
6,644; response rate = 50.4%) and GM 2010 (n = 3,817;
response rate = 55.5%). For the present analysis, data of
4,579 respondents aged 65 years were used. The response
rates among these groups were 59% and 74%, respectively.
In both surveys, there were no significant differences with
regard to age group and gender between the non-respondents
and respondents.
Questionnaire
Self-completion questionnaires were sent to the selected par-
ticipants. For specific groups, the questionnaires were provided
in their own language. Questionnaires could also be filled-out
online, and if required, assistance by an interviewer was pro-
vided. Non-respondents were encouraged by a reminder, and if
needed a second reminder or even by phone or visit.
The questionnaire was based on the national standard for
the Netherlands "Local and National Public Health Monitor"
(in Dutch: Lokale en Nationale Monitor Volksgezondheid
[LNMV]; GGD Nederland, ActiZ, & Rijksinstituut voor
Volksgezondheid en Milieu, 2005). It included a wide range
of health issues including physical and psychological health,
health care use, and lifestyle. Specific attention was paid to
the health of older people, including additional questions on
falling accidents.
Measures: Outcome Variables
Participants were asked whether they had experienced a fall in
the previous 12 months, how many times they had fallen, the
location of the last fall accident, if they had an injury due to the
last fall, and whether and from whom they had received medi-
cal attention after their last fall accident. Elderly persons who
experienced one or more falls in the past 12 months are defined
as "fallers" (individuals with no fall history) and those who
experienced more than one fall in the past 12 months as "recur-
rent fallers" (individuals with a fall history).
Measures: Independent Variables
·
· Demographics and socioeconomic characteristics
included age groups of 65 to 74 and 75 years, living
situation (alone or with someone), and level of
O and El Fakiri 3
education. Level of education is based on the highest
acquired education level and divided into three cate-
gories: low (elementary school or less), moderate
(lower vocational, general intermediate, intermediate
vocational or general secondary school), and high
(higher vocational education, college or university).
·
· Lifestyle included use of sedatives or tranquilizers
(use in the past 2 weeks), smoking (yes or no), alcohol
consumption (meeting the standard acceptable alco-
hol consumption or not), and physical inactivity
(respondent meets the Dutch Healthy Exercise Norm
or not). The standard acceptable alcohol consumption
in the Netherlands is defined as a maximum of two
glasses/drinking day for men and a maximum 1 glass/
drinking day for women (Nederlands Instituut voor
Alcoholbeleid [Dutch Institute for Alcohol Policy],
2009). The norm for healthy exercise is defined as a
minimum of 30 min of moderately intensive physical
activity per day (Wendel-Vos, Schuit, Saris, &
Kromhout, 2003).
·
· Physical health and limitations. For BMI (defined as
an individual's self-reported body weight divided by
the square of the person's height--typically given in
units of kg/m2), four categories were distinguished
following the World Health Organization BMI classi-
fication (World Health Organization, 2014): under-
weight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (18.5  BMI <
25), overweight (25  BMI < 30), and obesity (BMI 
30). Visual impairment was measured with two ques-
tions on the ability to read small letters and to recog-
nize the face of a person at a distance of 4 m. Hearing
disability was also measured by two questions about
following and having a conversation with a person or
group (Dijkshoorn et al., 2009). When one of these
questions is answered with "yes, very difficult" or
"no, I can't," a respondent is considered as having a
visual impairment or a hearing disability, respectively.
Ten questions assessed whether respondents had
problems with personal care, such as bathing, dress-
ing, eating, and mobility (e.g., getting out of bed and
walking across a room with limitations; Katz, Ford,
Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963). When a question
is answered with "very difficult" or "only with help of
others," this is reported as an ADL limitation
(Dijkshoorn et al., 2009).
·
· Psychological health. The following three variables
were examined: loneliness, depression, and fear of
falling. The scale of de Jong-Gierveld was used to
measure loneliness (de Jong-Gierveld & Kamphuls,
1985), categorized into three conditions: (a) based on
the total score (0-11), the respondents are divided into
two groups: "not/moderate (0-8)" and "severe/very
severe (9-11)" burden of loneliness; (b) emotional
loneliness: low emotional loneliness (0-3) and high
emotional loneliness (4-6); and (c) social loneliness:
low social loneliness (0-3) and high social loneliness
(4-6). The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)
was used to measure the level of distress and severity
associated with psychological symptoms (Kessler
et al., 2002). Low scores indicate low levels of psycho-
logical distress and high scores indicate high levels of
psychological distress.Two groups were distinguished:
respondents with a score 15 were considered as hav-
ing no or a low risk of depression, and respondents
with a score of 16 were considered as having a mod-
erate to high risk of depression. With regard to fear of
falling, one question asked about the extent to which
respondents experience fear of falling (answered on a
5-point Likert-type scale; Dijkshoorn et al., 2009).
Analysis
Participants aged 65 years and participants with missing data
on falling accidents were excluded from the analysis.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the frequency and
proportion of outcomes of non-fallers, fallers, and recurrent
fallers. Univariate logistic regression analyses were conducted
to determine the relationship between the variables of interest
and falling accidents in the last 12 months. Fallers were com-
pared with non-fallers, and recurrent fallers were compared
with participants who experienced no falls or only one fall.
Crude odds ratios (OR) were calculated for women and men
separately and for fallers and recurrent fallers. In addition, vari-
ables with a significant relation were used to conduct multivari-
ate logistic regression analyses to create risk models for women
and men separately, and for falling and recurrent falling.
The data were weighted on the basis of age and sex
according to the distribution of the population in Amsterdam
and surroundings at the time of data collection (2008 and
2010, respectively).
Statistical analyses were conducted with the SPSS ver-
sion 19.0. For all analyses, a p value .05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Of the 4,579 participants, 4,426 (97%) provided data on
falls: 2,552 females (58%) and 1,874 males (42%). The mean
age of women is 76.9 (SD = ±7.1) years and of men 75.7
(SD ±6.8) years. In the 12 months prior to the study, 34% of
the respondents had experienced at least one fall and 14%
had fallen multiple times (2 times).
Risk Factors for Female and Male Fallers and
Recurrent Fallers
For both women and men, significant relationships between fall-
ing and risk factors are found, except for smoking and BMI
(Table 1).The risk of falling is higher for men than for women on
all the significant factors, except for social loneliness (women:
4 SAGE Open
OR = 1.64; men: OR = 1.25). Education level is related with
fall accidents in men with a moderate education level (OR =
0.75), while consuming more than the acceptable alcohol
standard is a risk factor for women (OR = 1.29).
The results for recurrent fallers are similar to those for the
fallers but show a stronger relationship for nearly all signifi-
cant variables (Table 2). Both men and women with physical
limitations, who use sedatives or tranquilizers, and/or suffer
from depression, loneliness, or fear of falling, are more likely
to have recurrent falls than those not having these problems.
Elderly who are living with someone are less likely to fall
than those living alone. Similarly, physically active individu-
als are less likely to fall than the physically inactive. In gen-
eral, respondents with a moderate (or higher) educational
level are less likely to have a recurrent fall than those with a
low education level. However, this association is not signifi-
cant among highly educated women.
Risk Model for Falling and Recurrent Falling
Multiple logistic regression analysis shows that elderly aged
75 years who have an ADL limitation or experience fear of
falling, or use sedatives or tranquilizers are more likely to
fall than those aged 65 to 74 years without these factors
(Table 3). ADL limitations and fear of falling appear to be
stronger risk factors for men than for women (OR = 2.02 vs.
1.60 for ADL limitations, and OR = 2.66 vs. 1.65 for fear of
falling). In addition, alcohol use and educational level are
significant risk factors for women.
In general, the results of recurrent fallers are similar to
thosewhoexperiencedoneormorefalls(Table4).Individuals
who are afraid to fall or with ADL limitations are more likely
to have a recurrent fall accident than those who are not
afraid to fall or are not ADL limited, respectively. Especially
men with these conditions are at higher risk than women

(OR = 3.49 vs. 2.56 for fear of falling, and OR = 3.17 vs.
1.86 for ADL limitations). Also, loneliness is associated with
recurrent falling among women (OR = 2.91). Older men with
visual impairment are more likely to have recurrent falls than
those without this limitation (OR = 2.75).
Discussion
This study has identified three important risk factors that
increase the risk of falls in older people, regardless of their
fall history or gender; that is, age 75 years, having an ADL
limitation, or fear of falling. Elderly with a fall history and
one of the above-mentioned risk factors have a higher risk of
falls than those with no fall history. The use of sedatives or
tranquilizers increases the risk of falling for both men and
women, but appears to have no effect on recurrent falling.
Other risk factors of significance in this study are gender
related, such as alcohol use in women and visual limitation in
men.
These results support earlier studies reporting that about
one third of the people aged 65 years will fall during a
12-month period, and that fall accidents are associated with
multiple risk factors. Similar to other reports, in the present
study, age is a significant risk factor: As people get older,
balance reactions, increasing physical impairment, and other
age-induced changes (such as vision) may increase the risk
of falling (Gill et al., 2005; Rubenstein, 2006). Our finding
that functional limitations (as defined by ADL limitations)
are significantly associated with the risk of falling is also
consistent with previous research (Yokoya et al., 2007).
Fear of falling is a prominent symptom experienced by
many older people. In line with other research (Lach, 2005),
our findings show that fear of falling is consistently associ-
ated with a higher risk of falling, and in case of a fall history,

this risk increases even more for both males and females.
Many factors are associated with the development of fear of
falling, including having previous falls (Lach, 2005).
Consequently, elderly people who are afraid to fall tend to
avoid physical activity (Wijlhuizen, de, & Hopman-Rock,
2007). This reduced mobility may in turn increase the risk of
falling and social isolation and, in the long term, may lead to
loss of quality of life (Austin, Devine, Dick, Prince, & Bruce,
2007; Bruce, Devine, & Prince, 2002). As fear of falling is a
modifiable risk factor, preventive activities need to be
introduced early on, and intervention strategies should take
this risk factor into account, for example, by increasing
knowledge on how to reduce falls (Austin et al., 2007).
It is reported that use of certain medication, such as ben-
zodiazepines and sedatives, is a significant risk factor for
falls (Askari et al., 2013; Evans, 2003). Surprisingly, in the
present study, this risk factor only applies to individuals with
no fall history. This is in accordance withAskari et al. (Askari
et al., 2013), who found a relation between the use of several
different drugs and recurrent falls, whereas no such relation

was found between sedatives and recurrent falls. Additional
research is required to examine the effect of using these
drugs, as this is a modifiable risk factor that can be targeted
by interventions. Contrary to expectation, the association
between education level and risk of falling remains unclear.
Educational level appears to be a significant factor for falling
only among women. Earlier studies also reported contradic-
tory results: For example, whereas one study found that
highly educated elderly are less likely to fall (Gill et al.,
2005), another showed that a high education level is a risk
factor for falling (Pluijm et al., 2006).
Females consuming more than the acceptable alcohol
standard have a higher risk of falling than women drinking
no more than this standard, whereas this relation is not sig-
nificant in males. This difference between men and women
may be explained by the smaller gastric alcohol metabolism
in females, which increases the vulnerability of women to
the effects of ethanol (Baraona et al., 2001). Female recur-
rent fallers who are lonely are more likely to fall than those
who do not feel lonely. This may be attributed to a reciprocal
causation; a fall accident may increase the feeling of being
lonely and vice versa. Elderly males with a visual impair-
ment have a significantly higher risk of having 2 fall acci-
dents in the past 12 months. Also, among elderly males,
living with someone appears to be a risk factor for recurrent
falling. We have no explanation for this unexpected result.
Further research is required to examine this issue.
Strengths and Limitations
This study is cross-sectional and therefore susceptible to
reverse causality. Another limitation is the reliance on self-
reports for all measurements. However, we believe that socially
desirable answers are unlikely to play a role when reporting
risk factors/fall accidents. Also, although participants' answers
may be affected by recall bias (e.g., they may not remember the
exact number of fall accidents in the previous 12 months), our
data on fall accidents are in line with data from cohort studies
on falling among elderly (Stalenhoef et al., 2002).
It is known that neurological disorders are related to falls
(Allan, Ballard, Rowan, & Kenny, 2009; Marshall, 2012).
The present study provides no information on the relation-
ship between chronic disorders, for example, neurodegenera-
tive conditions and fall accidents. Chronic diseases were part
of the questionnaire, but three neurological diseases
(Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy) were
grouped in one item. The risk factors in this study were
selected based on modifiability (e.g., lifestyle, fear of fall-
ing) and/or targetability by preventive interventions. It is
possible that some individuals in the study sample may have
one of these disorders. Nevertheless, we are convinced that
the influence of this small proportion is negligible.
Strengths of the present study are the large sample of
elderly men and women, the high response rate, and the
considerable amount of information obtained on different
risk factors from the same sample. In addition, we investi-
gated the risk factors for single and recurrent falls, taking
into account differences between men and women; these
items have rarely been addressed in previous studies.
Implications for Practice
Based on these results, multifactorial interventions focusing
on the risk factors for fear of falling and on ADL limitations
may help in preventing falls. There is evidence that multi-
component cognitive behavioral interventions can be effective
in reducing concerns about falling (Zijlstra et al., 2009; Zijlstra
et al., 2011). Based on our findings with regard to gender dif-
ferences in risks for falls, more attention should be paid to men
with a visual impairment and to women who are lonely or who
drink more than the acceptable alcohol standard. Although
physical activity was not significant in the multiple logistic
analyses, fall prevention exercise programs for older people
not only reduce the rate of falls but also help to prevent injuries
caused by falls, including the most severe ones (El-Khoury,
Cassou, Charles, & Dargent-Molina, 2013; Karlsson,
Vonschewelov, Karlsson, Coster, & Rosengen, 2013).
Conclusion
The present study has identified several fall risk factors,
including three major risk factors for falling and recurrent
falling, regardless of gender, that is, fear of falling, ADL
limitations, and age 75 years. In all subgroups, fear of fall-
ing remains one of the common modifiable risk factors for
falls. The use of sedatives or tranquilizers increases the risk
of falling, but only among elderly with no fall history.
Regarding gender differences in fall risk, ADL limitations
and fear of falling appear to be stronger risk factors for men
than for women. In addition, alcohol use and educational
level are significant risk factors for women. Men with fear of
falling or ADL limitations are at a higher risk to have a recur-
rent fall accident than women with these conditions.
Loneliness is associated with recurrent falling among
women. Having a visual impairment or living with someone
is associated with recurrent falling among men.
Our findings emphasize the importance of multifactorial
fall interventions for fallers and recurrent fallers and of tak-
ing into account gender differences in the aim to reduce falls
among older people.
