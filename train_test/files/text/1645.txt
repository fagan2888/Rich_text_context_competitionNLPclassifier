Little of the literature on crime at the neighborhood level examines whether and
why some crime types predominate in a given neighborhood over other types.
Many macro-level theories do make predictions about the sort of crimes that
occur in some neighborhoods, although they remain largely untested. This study
focuses on one of these theories, differential opportunity, and its predictions
about the making of violent neighborhoods. Drawing on various data sources, this
inquiry determines whether crime profiles differ across Chicago neighborhoods--
that is, whether there is significant variation across neighborhoods on ratio of
violent crimes to other crime types. Next, it also investigates whether the struc-
tural factors implicated in the differential opportunity perspective distinguish
these neighborhoods or only predict the incidence of crime. The results reveal
significant differences in the distribution of crimes across neighborhoods, as well
as show that certain factors identify neighborhoods that favor violence over
other crimes.

Introduction
The study of crime at the macro-level has generally focused on establishing why
some neighborhoods have higher rates of crime than others. The social disorga-
nization tradition is perhaps the most well-known and developed piece of this
research. Beginning with the pioneering work of Shaw and McKay (1942), an
extensive literature has linked weakened neighborhood structures with more
crime. Shaw and McKay concluded that variation in delinquency across
geographic areas was a function of the variations in social disorganization,
defined as the breakdown in social institutions such as families, schools, and
churches. In Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas, they also observed that a
variety of social problems clustered in space along with delinquency, including
truancy, infant mortality, tuberculosis, and mental disorder. They subsequently
concluded that delinquency is not an isolated problem, but rather that the
physical, social, and economic conditions of neighborhoods impact many social
ills (see also Faris & Dunham, 1939; Silver, Mulvey, & Swanson, 2002). Thus, the
social disorganization tradition leads researchers to expect a generality, or vari-
ety, of behaviors and social outcomes in socially disorganized neighborhoods.
Yet macro-theories of crime occasionally speak to variation in crime types
within a geographically delimited unit, not just differences in the crime rate.
Consider, for example, that the hypothetical distribution of offenses for all areas
is approximately 40% violent and 60% nonviolent crime. Those areas featuring
70% violent and 30% nonviolent crime would represent a substantial departure
from the prevailing pattern. The literature examining the factors responsible for
the balance of violent to nonviolent crime within neighborhoods is quite scant,
however, especially compared to what is known about the antecedents of overall
neighborhood crime rates. Research has linked the key concepts of a number of
macro-level theories, including differential opportunity (Cloward & Ohlin, 1960),
with greater violence, yet this literature leaves open the possibility that the
constructs theorized as facilitating higher rates of violent crime in fact lead to
higher levels of crime across the entire spectrum of offense types, with no
particular tendency toward violence (i.e., the count of violent crime is higher,
but so too is property crime). An analysis that is specifically designed to study
the contrast in violent and nonviolent crime rates across neighborhoods could
clarify this issue and offer insight about the unique conditions that give rise to
violent neighborhoods, thereby commenting on the need for theories to articu-
late violence-specific mechanisms. Should the factors purportedly fueling
greater neighborhood violence in fact promote myriad outcomes, then violence-
specific theories would have to be expanded to account for them. But the
greater the differences between relatively violent high-crime neighborhoods and
relatively nonviolent high-crime neighborhoods, then the greater justification
VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOODS 773
there is for theories that disaggregate the mechanisms underlying various crime
types in neighborhoods. Put another way, the answer to the question of whether
neighborhoods significantly vary in the extent to which violence is responsible
for their crime rates can have a profound effect on the evolution of macro-level
theories of crime.
The current study attempts to fill this empirical void by investigating the
extent to which neighborhoods in Chicago demonstrate a relative proclivity for
violence over other crime types. Thus, this inquiry will comment on whether
systematic variations in crime exist across neighborhoods, not just with regard
to crime incidence, but also crime type. It also determines whether particular
factors traditionally implicated as producing high levels of violence in neighbor-
hoods (e.g., social disorganization) predict a differential tendency for violence
as opposed to universally high crime rates across all types of crime. In order to
do so, the current study uses data from the 1995 Project on Human Develop-
ment in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) Community Survey, the 1990 Census,
and officially reported crime data from the Chicago Police Department (CPD). It
also relies on an extension of a recently developed analytic technique that
detects both the extent and form of differential crime profiles (Osgood &
Schreck, 2007). These data and this method afford the opportunity to investi-
gate the theoretical expectations of the differential opportunity thesis with
respect to the types of crimes which cluster in space.
Theory and Research on Differentiating Violent versus
Nonviolent Neighborhoods
Whereas there is extensive literature on crime rates at the neighborhood level,
little of it directly bears on the extent to which some neighborhoods favor
particular crime types over others. The void of research explicitly addressing
differential crime profiles at the neighborhood level, with regard to crime type
rather than rate, is somewhat surprising since empirical work suggests that such
patterns may exist. Early cartographic work that, in part, served as the founda-
tion for the development of neighborhood-based theories demonstrated such
patterns. For example, Balbi and Guerry mapped official crimes across France
during the early part of the nineteenth century, noting that property and
violent crimes tended to concentrate in different regions (see Weisburd &
McEwan, 1998). More recently, research on crime at micro-level places (i.e.,
hot spots) also demonstrates that crime not only clusters at places, but that this
concentration can be of particular crime types (Sherman, Gartin, & Buerger,
1989). The premise underlying hot spots draws heavily from environmental
criminology (e.g., Cornish & Clarke, 1986) and routine activity theory (Cohen &
Felson, 1979), suggesting that opportunities for crime vary across locations,
whether because they provide differential access to crime targets, concentra-
tions of motivated offenders or gaps in supervision/guardianship. In some cases,
the opportunities for crime are ubiquitous, supporting a concentration of high
774 SCHRECK ET AL.
crime rates that cut across all crime types. In other cases, however, hot spots
reflect specific opportunities and crimes (e.g., Braga, Weisburd, Waring, &
Mazerolle, 1999; Weisburd & Green, 1995). Because opportunities for crime are
not solely dependent on the physical environment, but are also socially struc-
tured (Cloward, 1959), one may expect to see a similar pattern emerge at a
slightly higher level of aggregation from hot spots: neighborhoods.
In addition to these empirical patterns, some core theoretical treatises on
neighborhoods and crime discuss, explicitly or implicitly, how different social
structures facilitate different crime patterns. These viewpoints arguably include
subculture of violence perspectives, strain theories, and opportunity theories
that focus on how the proximate environment affects the nature of crime.
Perhaps the most explicit theory on this score is Cloward and Ohlin's (1960; see
also Cloward, 1959) differential opportunity theory--indeed, a core contribution
of this theory is its assertion that neighborhood characteristics mediate and
shape the expression of crime. In an attempt to bring together the contempo-
rary dominant theoretical traditions--anomie and differential association--into a
single explanation, they proposed that crime arises because of frustration asso-
ciated with unequal access to legitimate means to achieve success. For this
reason, there is systematic variation in crime rates across places and popula-
tions, with neighborhood disadvantage being a key indicator of where high
crime rates tend to cluster. Scholars often rely on this part of their proposition
to label Cloward and Ohlin strain theorists, but the unique contribution of their
argument is in their clear statement that "the pressures that lead to deviant
patterns do not necessarily determine the particular pattern that results"
(Cloward & Ohlin, 1960, p. 40; Cullen, 1988). They argue that, just as legitimate
means are not equally distributed, nor are illegitimate means; opportunities to
learn and engage in various types of crime are differentially distributed across
neighborhoods. Thus, Cloward and Ohlin (1960) suggested that in disadvantaged
neighborhoods, strain provides the motivation for crime and generally leads to
higher crime rates. But a neighborhood's social structure channels this motiva-
tion so that the higher crime rates manifest in differential crime-type profiles
(i.e., they anticipate both fluctuation in the incidence and distribution of crime
proportions across neighborhoods). In particular, "criminal" subcultures situ-
ated around property crimes form in neighborhoods characterized by dense,
though unconventional, social ties and cohesion while "conflict" subcultures
situated around violence form in areas lacking integrated social relations and
networks.
Just as differential opportunity theory implicated the role of social ties in the
production of crime, so too does social disorganization theory, though with
contrasting predictions. In socially disorganized areas, characterized at the
macro-level by factors such as residential mobility and economic disadvantage,
social networks are sparse or weak and formal and informal social controls are
constrained (Bursik, 1986, 1988; Sampson & Groves, 1989). Under the social
disorganization perspective, the void of stable and cohesive social networks in a
neighborhood leads to a generalized increase in crime, of which violence is
VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOODS 775
part. From this standpoint, structural factors should affect the incidence of
crime but not necessarily the differential distribution of its form; factors indica-
tive of social disorganization should not be implicated in shaping crime patterns
that favor one type (e.g., violence) in any systematic way. To be sure, the
original data with which Shaw and McKay (1942) illustrated their premise
focused on a variety of delinquent offenses, not particular crime types (see also
the complementary work of Thrasher, 1927).
In contrast, Cloward and Ohlin's (1960) differential opportunity perspective
proposes that social disorganization leads to the emergence of a conflict
subculture, not to generalized and universally high crime rates. As per their
argument, in socially disorganized areas, there is a void of both legitimate and
illegitimate means to deal with strain, and violence becomes the only way to
achieve status and success. Cloward and Ohlin argued that socially disorganized
neighborhoods provide neither the opportunities nor the learning models for
skills oriented around property crime enterprises, which would limit the
incidence of property-related offenses. The fractured social cohesion and insta-
bility of the neighborhood, however, curtails its ability to manage and control
violence, thereby allowing violent offending to comprise a greater share of the
neighborhood crime distribution. Whereas some theorists find it paradoxical
that socially organized areas can have high crime rates, Cloward and Ohlin
(1960; Cloward, 1959) argued that criminal enterprise subcultures can flourish
in economically deprived neighborhoods that have sufficient social cohesion and
interconnectedness of legitimate and illegitimate social networks, which bears
out in some empirical work (Chin, 1996; Whyte, 1943). In this way, they also
imply that some neighborhoods may have crime profiles that favor nonviolent
crime.
Importantly, it does not appear that differential opportunity suggests that
only violent crime will occur in neighborhoods devoid of social organization;
offenders may channel frustration and seek status though occasional vandalism
and theft, for example. Still, Cloward and Ohlin are clear in their assertions
that, relative to other neighborhoods, violence should be a defining characteris-
tic of socially disorganized areas and not merely part and parcel of high crime
rates. In the end, therefore, the traditional social disorganization perspective
asserts that structural indicators such as instability and weak social networks
should identify high-crime neighborhoods, whereas differential opportunity
argues that they should identify neighborhoods dominated by violence.
The literature does highlight an empirical connection between social disorga-
nization and violence. For example, Sampson (1987) found that the key mediator
between black unemployment and city-level violence was family breakdown,
since it impacted social control and stability at both the neighborhood and
individual levels. In this way, the argument is that economic deprivation does not
inherently promote violent crime, but rather its effect operates primarily through
weakened family and neighborhood social structure. More recent work echoes
this point. Ousey (2000) found that deindustrialization, which amplifies economic
disparity, promotes violent crime (juvenile homicide) because it increases the
776 SCHRECK ET AL.
amount of female-headed households, which also affects social controls at the
neighborhood level. Like Sampson (1987), he argued that neighborhoods with
higher rates of female-headed households tend to have lower levels of formal
social control, since single mothers tend to be less involved in neighborhood
organizations, as well as informal social control, since single parent households
tend to be less involved with neighbors. Furthermore, Ousey (2000) hypothesized
that fathers who abandon family roles and are also deprived of economic oppor-
tunities because of deindustrialization are essentially excluded from legitimate
social networks, increasing the odds of violence in the neighborhood. Sampson
et al.'s work on collective efficacy also clearly draws a connection between a
vacuum of social organization, residential stability, cohesion, and violent crime
(Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997; see also Clear, Rose, Waring, & Scully,
2003; Rosenfeld, Messner, & Baumer, 2001; Taylor & Covington, 1988).
Collectively, such studies demonstrate that disadvantaged neighborhoods
characterized by social instability and a void of cohesion will have higher rates
of violence. These notions certainly evoke Cloward and Ohlin's (1960) argu-
ments that a void of integrated and cohesive social networks can promote a
violent subculture, since it limits opportunities for other criminal enterprise and
the neighborhood has a limited capacity to control youth violence. But it
remains unclear whether these factors (1) truly underlie a neighborhood procliv-
ity for violence over other crime types, or (2) instead affect crime in a universal
manner. Studies that only focus on violence as an outcome (e.g., Ousey, 2000;
Sampson, 1987; Sampson et al., 1997) may miss complementary high nonviolent
crime rates. Indeed, studies that do account for property crime often find it too
has a relationship with macro-level social instability and social disorganization
(Crutchfield, Geerken, & Gove, 1982; Kposowa, Breault, & Harrison, 1995;
Raudenbush & Sampson, 1999; Sampson & Groves, 1989). In this way, there
remains the question as to what degree malfunctioning neighborhood structure
specifically favors violence relative to other crime types or whether neighbor-
hood conditions fuel proportionate growth in all crime.
There are a few indications that structural and organizational factors may
affect violent and property crime in different ways. For instance, Stark, Doyle,
and Kent (1980) and Stark, Bainbridge, Crutchfield, Doyle, and Finke (1983)
found that certain measures of social integration, such as church membership,
were more strongly related to property crime than violent crime (see also
Kposowa et al., 1995). Hipp's (2007) recent analysis of police data across 19
cities offers perhaps the best evidence on the factors responsible for crime-type
differentiation across neighborhoods. One of the research questions he explored
was the impact of various structural dimensions of neighborhoods on violent and
property crime rates. Running separate models for violent (murder, aggravated
assault, robbery) and nonviolent crime (burglary, motor vehicle theft), Hipp
found that greater inequality and ethnic heterogeneity resulted in higher crime
rates overall, but the effect coefficients were typically more salient for violent
crimes than property crimes. Like previous studies investigating both property
and violent crime, however, Hipp's (2007) results are still suggestive, as his
VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOODS 777
primary focus was on explaining overall crime rates and not on defining or
directly measuring the contrast in violent versus nonviolent offending at the
neighborhood level. Thus, extant literature cannot address the key point at
which social disorganization and differential opportunity diverge. Disorganiza-
tion scholars generally assume that disorganized neighborhoods will produce a
variety of crimes whereas differential opportunity adopts a view that the same
structural and organizational conditions would promote a distribution of crime
where violence comprises a much larger share of the criminal activity. Findings
to date reveal that a variety of crime and social problems are associated with
disorganization, but it is not yet certain if disorganization predicts a relative
tendency for violent crimes over other types.
The Current Study
While there is considerable empirical evidence that neighborhood social ties and
disorganization influence rates of crime (see e.g., Bursik & Grasmick, 1993;
Sampson & Groves, 1989; Sampson et al., 1997), it remains unclear whether a
void of integrated and cohesive social networks (1) underlie a neighborhood
proclivity for violence over other crime types, or (2) instead affect crime in a
universal manner. A proclivity for violence may occur because certain condi-
tions give rise or permit violent crime but not property crime, or because these
conditions affect violent and property crime to different degrees (i.e., weak
social networks may increase both crime types, but the magnitude may be
greater with regard to violence). In this way, neighborhood factors may not only
impact the local crime rate, but also predict variations in the relative portion of
crime types that comprise this rate.
The current study addresses this issue by using a newly developed analytic
method that can detect differential crime profiles at the neighborhood level,
drawing on official crime reports from the Chicago PD. After assessing whether
there are significant differences in the relative distribution of crime types (i.e.,
violence and nonviolence) across neighborhoods, this inquiry will determine
whether structural factors reflective of a void in social organization predict this
differential tendency, independent of local crime rates. If disorganization
produces a significantly greater preponderance of violence, then differential
opportunity theory is supported, but if the indicators of disorganization do not
result in a significant differential impact on the contrast of violence to nonvio-
lence in the neighborhood, then the notion that social disorganization has
general effects would be supported.
Data and Measures
Data utilized in this study come from three sources: the PHDCN, the 1990 U.S.
Census, and the CPD. Measures of neighborhood social processes come from the
778 SCHRECK ET AL.
PHDCN 1994­1995 Community Survey of 8,782 Chicago residents. For the
purposes of the PHDCN, neighborhood boundaries were operationally defined by
combining 847 census tracts into 343 neighborhood clusters, constructed to be
internally homogeneous with respect to socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity,
housing density, and family structure (Sampson et al., 1997).1 Survey questions
include items about the social organization of neighborhoods, including an
emphasis on neighborhood social ties.
Recall Cloward and Ohlin's (1960) assertion that criminal subcultures
oriented toward property crimes form in neighborhoods characterized by dense
social ties while conflict subcultures situated around violence form in areas
lacking integrated social relations. Thus, we utilize a measure of neighborhood
social ties in our analyses and hypothesize that violence will be relatively more
prevalent compared to nonviolent crime in those neighborhoods characterized
by weak neighborly social ties. We construct a scale of neighborly ties with the
following survey items related to the frequency (i.e., how often) of contact and
support among neighbors: (1) Do you and people in your neighborhood do favors
for each other? (2) Do you and other neighbors watch over someone's property
when they are not home? (3) Do you and people in your neighborhood ask each
other for advice? (4) Do you and people in your neighborhood have parties
where other people in the neighborhood are invited? and (5) Do you and other
people in your neighborhood visit in each other's home or on the street?2
Our measure of neighborhood social ties was constructed via a multilevel
regression model, with item responses to each survey question nested within a
respondent, and respondents nested within neighborhood clusters (see also,
Raudenbush & Sampson, 1999; Sampson & Bartusch, 1998). The first level of the
model represents an item response model with scale scores adjusted for missing
data and unreliability. At the second level of the model, scale scores are
adjusted for the individual characteristics of respondents in neighborhood clus-
ters (gender, age, race and ethnicity, marital status, education, employment
status, homeownership, years of residence in neighborhood, and the number of
residential moves in the five years leading up the survey). At the third level of
the model, each neighborhood-specific mean for a given scale is allowed to vary
around the mean score for the city as a whole. From this three-level regression
1. In analyses, we follow the standard practice of many PHDCN studies of excluding the neighbor-
hood cluster which contains O'Hare airport.
2. We specifically use this measure in lieu of collective efficacy, which is a combination of social
cohesion (e.g., people around here are willing to help their neighbors) and informal social control
(which focuses on neighbors' willingness to intervene upon witnessing deviance). In theory, collec-
tive efficacy can be applied to achieve any collective goal; yet in practice, measures of collective
efficacy are infused with a prosocial and conventional quality. Thus, the traditional measurement of
collective efficacy does not match the key point at which differential opportunity and social
disorganization differ, which is the notion that neighborhood ties and cohesion are not inherently
prosocial. Because some scholars may not view social disorganization in this systemic way, but
rather see it as focusing on legitimate ties and networks, we also estimated models with collective
efficacy. Supplemental analysis, available upon request, demonstrates that collective efficacy
behaves in a manner similar to the neighborhood ties measure. Still, because it is more consistent
with our theoretical framework, we present the results with the neighborhood ties variable.
VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOODS 779
model, a neighborhood-specific empirical Bayes residual is output, which is the
neighborhood-specific scale we use in analyses (see Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002,
chap. 3).
Neighborhood structural data come from the 1990 U.S. Census. Consistent
with research in the social disorganization tradition, we utilize three measures
of neighborhood structure: concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, and
immigrant concentration. A meta-analysis of the social disorganization literature
indicates that these measures generally are predictive of neighborhood crime
and disorder (Pratt & Cullen, 2005). These scales are created via factor analyses
from resident responses to multiple census questions, where items included in
each factor are weighted by their factor loadings. Concentrated disadvantage
refers to a scale of economic disadvantage influenced by poverty, family status,
age, employment, and race. Specifically, the following census indicators are
used to construct the measure: the percentage of families below the poverty
line, percentage of families receiving public assistance, percentage of unem-
ployed individuals in the civilian labor force, percentage of female-headed fami-
lies with children, percentage of residents under age 18, and the percentage of
black residents. Residential stability is derived from the following census indica-
tors: percentage of residents five years old and older who lived in the same
house five years earlier, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied.
Finally, immigrant concentration is derived from two census indicators: the
percentage of Latino residents and the percentage of foreign-born residents.
Incident-level reported crime data for the years 1995 and 1996 were
obtained from the CPD.3 Address information from each incident was used to
geocode the location of the crime to the corresponding PHDCN neighborhood
cluster. Readers should note that the available data for these two years contain
slightly different assortments of offenses. For 1995, violent crimes included
assault, homicide, and robbery. Nonviolent crimes included burglary, vandal-
ism, auto theft, theft, drugs, and vice. The 1996 data reported aggravated
assault, assault, homicide and robbery (for violence) and vandalism and burglary
(for property offending). As detailed in the next section, we combine these
measures into latent variables using measurement modeling techniques, which
should reduce variations in the results arising from measurement errors. The
relevant items and their descriptive information are reported in Appendix A.
Though many studies investigating crime at the neighborhood level have relied
on official records (e.g., Bursik, Grasmick, & Chamlin, 1990), scholars nonethe-
less recognize their limitations and provide appropriate caution. Although we
know some about individual-level determinants of reporting crime, the extent
to which neighborhood level factors impact reporting, and in which direction it
operates, remains clouded (see Baumer, 2002). For this reason, even though we
believe the current data are the best suited to the question at hand, we
acknowledge the limitations of using official records.

Analytical Methods
Our analytic strategy consists of two steps: first we employ a modified version
of a statistical model developed by Osgood and Schreck (2007) to detect
differential crime profiles. Second, after estimating each neighborhood's crime
profile (i.e., the relative proportion of violent to nonviolent crimes), we model
that profile as a function of neighborhood structural predictors and social ties in
a spatial regression model. As the aforementioned article provides a detailed
explanation of the technique, this presentation is limited to the main features
(see also, Schreck, Stewart, & Osgood, 2008) and our modifications.
Detecting Crime Profiles
Osgood and Schreck's (2007) method derives from an item response theory (IRT)
conception of measurement (Osgood, McMorris, & Potenza, 2002) in a multilevel
regression framework (Raudenbush, Johnson, & Sampson, 2003). This model
provides some important benefits for the current investigation relative to a more
traditional regression or, for instance, a geographically identified system analysis
that either treats violent and nonviolent crime as separate dependent variables
or else uses the ratio of violent to property crime. First, our analysis can assess
whether there are significant differences in the crime distributions across neigh-
borhoods, relative to population base rates for each offense type. This allows us
to determine the extent to which neighborhoods truly vary and are unique in their
crime distributions, as opposed to demonstrating differences generated by
chance. Second, our approach addresses any potential confounding between over-
all crime rates and the tendencies of neighborhoods to differentiate by crime
type, as well as controls for the measurement precision of the data. Taken
together then, the model can distinguish between (1) neighborhoods with high
levels of violence, but where there are also concomitantly high levels of nonviolent
crime, and (2) neighborhoods that are significantly different from the mode with
regard to the portion of their criminal repertoire that comprises violent crime.
At Level 1, the multilevel regression model specifies a measurement model
defining two indices, the first reflecting the combined violent and nonviolent
crime rates within neighborhoods and the second reflecting the differential
tendency among neighborhoods toward either violent or nonviolent crime. This
level therefore will provide insight as to whether there is any evidence of
systematic differences in crime type across neighborhoods, or simply differ-
ences in crime incidence. The Level 1 unit of analysis is the rate of offending
within a neighborhood for a specific type of crime, and the Level 2 unit of anal-
ysis is the neighborhood. Integrating these two levels of analysis in a single
model enables us to address the variation across neighborhoods in the overall
rate of crime as well as the relative proclivity of violent to nonviolent crimes.
In the notation of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; Raudenbush & Bryk,
2002), our Level 1 regression equation is:
VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOODS 781
The Level 2 regression equations are:
The Level 1 equation serves as the measurement model and it establishes the
meaning of the Level 2 equations. IRT models often employ dichotomous item-
level data (Osgood et al., 2002); however, neighborhood-level crime rates are
continuous measures. HLM can accommodate non-dichotomous data in several
ways: via ordinal logistic, Poisson, or linear regression models. Given the contin-
uous nature of our data, we specified linear regression and log-transformed the
crime rates in order to normalize their distribution. This converts the Level 1
measurement model from the more complex linear form of IRT models to the
more straightforward linear form of classical measurement models (see Baker,
2001). The Level 1 outcome measure thus is neighborhood j's rate or offense
type i. Should neighborhood j report, for instance, that 50 offenses occurred for
every 100,000 residents for offense i, then Yij = 50.
Overall crime rate
In Equation (1), the rate for each offense within the neighborhood will depend
on three factors. The first is the equation's constant term, 0j, which applies
equally to all offense types. This coefficient varies randomly across neighbor-
hoods, as indicated by the residual term in its Level 2 equation (u0j of Equation
(2)). Accordingly, 0j is a latent variable that captures neighborhood differences
in crime rates across all offenses, or the overall crime rate. The variance of the
residual term u0j, or 00, reflects the extent of neighborhood differences in this
tendency. The amount of variance depends on the degree to which higher offense
rates for each offense are associated with higher rates for all other offense types.
Differential in violence versus nonviolence
In Osgood and Schreck's (2007) basic model, the second factor determining the
rate for a given offense is the neighborhood's level of favoring violent crime. 1j
takes on this meaning when the variable Vio is coded with a positive value for
measures of violent crimes and a negative value for measures of nonviolent crime.

crime, Vio is coded to have a mean of zero for every neighborhood (i.e., a group-

tendency calibrated to reflect the difference between a neighborhood's log rate
of violent crime versus its log rate of nonviolent crime.
Neighborhoods with a relative preponderance of violent crime to nonviolent
crime would have a higher rate of offending for crimes with positive values on
Vio, and thus a positive value on 1j. Where the distribution of crime rates
favors nonviolent crime, the opposite pattern will occur and result in a negative
value on 1j. Because the Level 2 equation for 1j includes a residual term, this
index of neighborhood violence is a latent variable that varies across neighbor-
hoods, and the corresponding variance term (11) will reflect the extent to
which neighborhoods systematically differ in their tendency toward violent
versus nonviolent crime. An absence of variance would indicate a complete
overlap in violent and nonviolent crime, with observed variation across neigh-
borhoods due only to chance. A high level of variance, on the other hand, would
be indicative that the two are quite distinct.
Item base-rates
The third factor contributing to the magnitude of a neighborhood's crime rate
for a given offense is the base-rate of offenses, expressed by the parameters
ij. Relatively rare forms of crime, which typically are more serious as well
(Osgood et al., 2002; Raudenbush et al., 2003), will have lower values of ij and
more common crimes will have higher values. These parameters are incorpo-
rated in the model through a series of dummy variables coded to reflect which
item is associated with each response (i.e., a value of 1 for that dummy variable
and 0 for all others). These base-rate parameters are constant across the
sample rather than varying across neighborhoods, as reflected in the absence of
a residual term in Equation (4).4
Spatial Regression
Neighborhoods are interdependent ecological units, such that the conditions
in one neighborhood are influenced by the conditions of spatially proximate
neighborhoods. Spatial dependence among neighborhoods arises, in part, because
we are artificially dividing a continuous geographic space (i.e., Chicago) into sepa-
4. Our measurement model is a Rasch model, which assumes that all items are equally related to
the latent variable, and we assessed the plausibility of this assumption in the same manner as
Osgood and Schreck (2007). Consistent with this assumption, (1) all items were positively correlated
with each other and had high positive loadings on a first factor in a factor analysis, and (2) violent
crime items generally were more strongly associated with one another than with nonviolent offense
items (Osgood & Schreck, 2007; Raudenbush et al., 2003). The model also assumes that the residuals
of the latent variables (u) have a multivariate normal distribution, and our tests indicated no viola-
tions of this assumption.
VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOODS 783
rate neighborhoods. Thus, it may be the case that: (1) the crime rate in a given
neighborhood is influenced by the extent of crime in proximate neighborhoods,
and (2) that the proportion of violent to nonviolent crime in a given neighborhood
is influenced by the proportion in proximate neighborhoods. Accordingly, prior
research suggests that ignoring spatial dependence may lead to biased parameter
estimates and erroneous conclusions about statistical significance (Anselin, 1988;
Baller, Anselin, Messner, Deane, & Hawkins, 2001; Messner et al., 1999).
In order to estimate a spatial model, we output the Level 2 residuals from
Equations (2) and (3) from the multilevel framework previously described, and
import those residuals as dependent variables into a software program designed
for undertaking spatial regression analyses.5 With a spatial lag model, we
estimate two separate regression equations, one for the overall crime rate (0j)
and another for the violence differential (1j).6 In these equations, we model
the respective dependent variable as a function of concentrated disadvantage,
residential stability, immigrant concentration, and neighborhood ties, while
also controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Thus, through such an analytic
framework, we are able to detect the association between our four measures of
neighborhood characteristics and our dependent variables, net of spatial depen-
dencies. Readers should be aware, however, that using predicted scores derived
from latent variables in a basic regression analysis has some potential problems
of its own, as a large number of items is needed to reduce potential bias in the
predicted scores (see Lu, Thomas, & Zumbo, 2005).7
Results
Our initial question concerns the significance of the contrast of violent to nonvi-
olent crime across neighborhoods, or whether any observed variations in the
patterns can be ruled out as plausibly a byproduct of chance. To address this,
Osgood and Schreck (2007) used a z test, which employs the relevant variance
components (11) to assess whether adolescents had different violent offending
histories. Here, we use the same strategy to see if individual neighborhoods reveal
significantly different violent crime profiles. Note that the information reported
in Table 1 omits explanatory (i.e., Level 2) variables, as we are interested in the
5. All spatial models reported to follow were estimated in the GeoDa program.
6. Given the existence of spatial autocorrelation, it must be determined how to incorporate spatial
dependence into model specification. There are two general approaches for introducing spatial
dependence into regression models: spatial lag terms and spatial error terms. In preliminary analy-
ses, we employed a Lagrange Multiplier test to assess spatial autocorrelation, and to assess the
exact form of spatial dependence. We find evidence of spatial autocorrelation with respect to crime
(0j) and violence differentials (1j), and that a spatial lag model is most appropriate for modeling
these dependent variables.
7. To provide some speculative information about whether the bias might affect our substantive
results, we also ran a latent variable regression with predictors (as shown in Osgood & Schreck,
2007). This does not control for spatial autocorrelation, however. Even so, the results of this analysis
are consistent with those reported here, indicating that the bias does not affect the significance of
our key variables.

full variances. The ratio of the variance components for the latent variables to
their standard errors must exceed 3.3 if they are to be significant at the .001
level. Since the ratios for both years are 6.8 and 6.3, respectively, for 1995 and
1996, our results show that there is significant differentiation in crime patterns
across neighborhoods, and that this is unlikely to have been generated by chance.
Moreover, a comparison of the variances of the violent crime differential
measures to those for overall crime rates shows that they account for a substan-
tial portion of the overall crime rate within the average neighborhood.8
The variance components also speak to the degree of this systematic variation
in the proportion of violence for a neighborhood's reported crime rate. The vari-
ance in 1995 was .54 with a standard deviation of .74. Exponentiating the standard
deviation indicates how much each standard deviation increase in the tendency
for violence multiplies the ratio of the rate of violent crime to the rate of nonvi-
olent crime. For 1995, this meant that each standard deviation increase in the
violent crime differential resulted in the rate of violent offenses growing by more
than two for every unit increase in the rate of nonviolent offenses (exp(.74) =
2.10). For 1996 ( = .69, s = .83), the pattern was very similar (exp(.83) = 2.29).
To provide another perspective on the magnitude of differential distributions
of violence, we report in Table 2 the average violent and nonviolent crime rates
(per 100,000 people) for all neighborhoods based on their classification as either
"violent," "neither violent nor nonviolent," or "nonviolent" neighborhoods.9
HLM scores each case based on how far that neighborhood's distribution of
violent to nonviolent crime deviates from population base rates. Those neighbor-
hoods with a positive score for Vio and, moreover, are one standard deviation or
greater from the mean are the "violent" neighborhoods. Neighborhoods that are
at least one standard deviation from the mean in a negative direction are the
"nonviolent" neighborhoods. The remaining cases are classified as "neither,"
with a distribution of crime generally approximating the overall distribution of
8. Table 1 also reports reliabilities for both latent variables across each wave. The measure for over-
all crime rates is highly reliable, exceeding .80 for both years. In contrast, the differential violence
variable is considerably less reliable (.50 for each wave). A measurement model approach is there-
fore valuable with respect to addressing limited measurement reliability.
9. The rates reported in Table 2 are not log-transformed. The rates shown here reflect the average
rate for the violence and nonviolence items for each year.

violence to nonviolence. These classifications are somewhat arbitrary in that
Osgood and Schreck's (2007) technique treats differential crime profiles as a
continuous variable, but they are sufficient to provide a rough comparison of
crime rates. Within each category, there will not be uniformity among neighbor-
hoods in terms of their distribution of crime.
Table 2 reveals several interesting patterns. The neighborhoods we classified
as "violent" tend to have higher crime rates across the board than the other two
types of neighborhoods. That is, "violent" neighborhoods had high rates of
nonviolent as well as violent crimes. Note, however, that for 1995, the ratio of
violent to nonviolent crimes was 1.41 to 1 (and 1.36 to 1 for 1996). For every
property crime that the police learned about from these neighborhoods, roughly
1.4 violent crimes were reported. The neighborhoods that tended toward
neither violence nor nonviolence typically had a somewhat more even balance
of violent to nonviolent crimes, and lower rates of crime overall relative to the
"violent" neighborhoods. "Nonviolent" neighborhoods comprise the remainder
of cases, and not only did they have the lowest rates of crime generally, the
ratio of violent to nonviolent crime distinctly favored nonviolent crimes (i.e.,
.86 and .50 violent crimes for every nonviolent crime in 1995 and 1996, respec-
tively). In short, as we mentioned earlier, it would be a mistake to characterize
violent neighborhoods as places where only violent crime takes place. Rather,
such neighborhoods reveal a lot of crimes of all types; however, there is a
differential clearly tending toward violence.10
If these results are to justify further study, then crime-type differentiation
should be an enduring property of the neighborhood and not a transient finding.
10. As discussed earlier, this model detects differential crime profiles/distributions relative to popu-
lation base rates. This means that if the modal ratio of violent to nonviolent crime was .3 to 1, then
neighborhoods that averaged .8 violent crimes for every 1 nonviolent crime might have significantly
different profiles and therefore be deemed the relatively "violent" neighborhoods. This may not
strike some scholars as having face validity, certainly in comparison to the differential ratios that
emerged in the current investigation. Still, because the "average" proportion of violence in the
crime rate likely varies from location to location (much like the average crime rate would), having
some objective scale of what constitutes relatively violent neighborhoods may be misleading. Such a
scenario remains hypothetical, but we nonetheless urge replication of our inquiry outside Chicago in
order to frame an empirically informed discussion of this issue.

Given that we have multiple years of crime data, we are able to examine the
stability of these differential tendencies for violence. We obtained stability
estimates by correlating the latent variables for overall crime and Vio with
themselves, and these results are reported in Table 3. Overall crime rates for
1995 and 1996 were nearly perfectly correlated, meaning that neighborhoods
reported levels of crime virtually identical in magnitude from one year to the
next. This result is consistent with those reported in the earliest literature on
social disorganization (Shaw & McKay, 1942). The stability of the differential
between violence and nonviolence, however, is not as well documented. Our
results showed that there is impressive consistency in the tendency of neighbor-
hoods to favor violence between the years 1995 and 1996. Recall that 1995 and
1996 employed slightly different measures, so this correlation probably reflects
correction for measurement error. Thus, not only do the "violent neighborhood"
crime ratios look remarkably similar from year to year despite some measure-
ment differences, but the neighborhoods are nicely consistent in these ratios
over time. The remaining coefficients in Table 3 report the intercorrelation
between overall crime rates and crime differentiation for both years. The strong
positive correlation values verify what Tables 1 and 2 indicated earlier, which is
that neighborhoods with higher crime also tended to have an increasing prepon-
derance of violence within their overall pattern.
Table 4 shows how measures central to social disorganization and differential
opportunity theories perform with respect to predicting overall (logged) crime
rates and differential distributions of violence, net of our control for spatial
autocorrelation. The results for the overall crime models are consistent with
earlier work based on PHDCN data using the same or similar measures (e.g.,
Browning, Feinberg, & Dietz, 2004; Sampson et al., 1997), and we report them
here primarily to replicate earlier research and verify that our measures are
performing as expected. The coefficients in Table 4, under the "violence differ-
ential" columns, report the log-rate differential for violent and nonviolent
crime for each unit increase in the independent variable. Should a coefficient

here not be statistically significant, that would only signify that its effect does
not disproportionately influence the log-rates for either violent or nonviolent
crime and would thus support the generality of the effects of social disorganiza-
tion. Variables with differential effects will achieve statistical significance, and
thus support differential opportunity theory's predictions. Again, the effects
of the coefficients in the violence differential models are independent of over-
all crime rates.
For both 1995 and 1996, two of the indicators of social disorganization consis-
tently had significant differential effects (with 1995 being a cross-sectional
analysis for most measures and 1996 being an analysis with lagged predictors).
Recall that differential opportunity theory would predict that stronger social
ties within the neighborhood should produce a higher relative incidence of
nonviolent crime, where the opposite would be true of neighborhoods where
such ties were weak. Our results show that even as stronger neighborhood ties
are associated with lower crime rates (based on the overall crime model), the
negative coefficient in the violence differential model means that of the crimes
that do take place, each unit increase in neighborhood ties corresponds with a
greater proportion of nonviolent crime. Greater concentrated disadvantage and
residential mobility should result in similarly noticeable differentials of violence
to nonviolence. For both 1995 and 1996, increasing concentrated disadvantage
was associated with a greater preponderance of violence to nonviolence in a
neighborhood's crime distribution. Residential stability, oddly, was associated
with violence having a greater share of the crimes in 1995, but its failure to
predict a differential in 1996 indicates that this effect might be an artifact of
chance. The general tenor of the results indicates that disorganized areas not
only have more crime, but they have more violent crime relative to property
crime than in organized areas. Reported crime in the more highly organized
neighborhoods disproportionately tends to be of a nonviolent nature. The

general consistency of both the significance and direction of the effects of the
independent variables across waves of data adds credibility to these measures
as true predictors of a differential crime profile favoring violence.11
Discussion
Park (1936), a forefather of social disorganization theory and the Chicago
School, used the term "web of life" as a metaphor for human communities. He
argued that the disruption of this web (i.e., the interdependence of people)
would result in a complex and maladaptive chain of effects. Research starting
with that of Shaw and McKay (1942) would confirm this characterization, as
social problems of almost every stripe seem to coalesce in areas of disorganiza-
tion. Clearly then, social disorganization theory is designed to explain how
neighborhood failure yields cascading, yet undifferentiated, varieties of hard-
ship and adversity upon residents (e.g., Browning et al., 2004; Sampson, 2003;
Sampson, Sharkey, & Raudenbush, 2008).
At the same time, research far older than that of Park or Shaw and McKay
demonstrated that patterns of violence and nonviolence were not homogeneous
across areas. Later, scholars, such as Cloward and Ohlin and a string of subcul-
ture of violence theorists, would address this inconsistency and implicate
factors they saw as specific to explaining violence in the neighborhood. Cloward
and Ohlin's differential opportunity theory takes the clearest position with
respect to the types of crimes that occur within neighborhoods, going so far as
to argue that neighborhoods "specialize" in some types of crime, in much the
same way that individuals might.
The objectives of this investigation were to better understand the properties
of differential patterns of crime across neighborhoods and to explain why
violence might predominate in some neighborhoods but not in others. Specifi-
cally, we were interested in documenting the extent, stability, and antecedents
of neighborhood crime patterns. Osgood and Schreck's (2007) statistical method
is ideal for our purpose, as it is explicitly designed to analyze the balance of
violence to nonviolence independently of overall crime rates. In order to study
crime rates, it was necessary to modify their technique slightly in order to
accommodate continuous interval-level data. One contribution of this research
is thus to introduce a new statistical tool to macro-criminology, and one that is
well capable of addressing questions that are of substantive importance.
Using data from over 300 Chicago neighborhoods, we found that neighbor-
hoods do clearly distinguish themselves based upon the types of crimes that
occur there. Specifically, certain neighborhoods demonstrated crime rates that
favored violent crime with ratios that were unlikely due to chance, just as some
11. Though the models predicting 1995 crime data are vulnerable to causal order criticisms,
replicating results for the lagged (1996) analysis nonetheless provide a sense of how stable the
predictors are.
VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOODS 789
favored nonviolent crime significantly more so than did the "average" neighbor-
hood. Moreover, there was remarkable stability in both overall crime rates and
the distribution of crimes taking place in these neighborhoods over the two
years of crime data analyzed. Neighborhoods that had a preponderance of
violence to nonviolence in 1995 very often had a similar preponderance in 1996.
Although future research should consider longer time windows in order to verify
the stability findings reported here, these results are evidence that the contrast
of violence to nonviolence across neighborhoods is both distinct from crime
incidence and substantively meaningful, which should open up an additional line
of empirical inquiry with regard to neighborhoods and crime.
The results predicting these differential crime profiles have some interesting
theoretical implications. Our investigation suggests that social disorganization
fuels both violent and nonviolent crime, attesting to the notion that the theory
does have general effects on the crime rate. At the same time, however, factors
indicative of disorganization rather clearly act as accelerants for violent offend-
ing (and less so for nonviolent crime). Social disorganization theory, as presently
formulated, does not speak to why this might be the case. Alternatively, Cloward
and Ohlin's differential opportunity theory, long viewed with skepticism among
leading theorists (Hirschi, 1979; Kornhauser, 1978), generally finds support from
this finding. To the extent that the PHDCN's measures of disorganization imply
weakened collective social control, our results indicate that neighborhood disor-
ganization has clearer implications for the social control of violence than for
nonviolence. From our results, we would expect that programs designed to
lessen social disorganization (e.g., starting neighborhood organizations) would
address local violence more effectively than property crime. Indeed, as social
organization improves, there may come a point at which nonviolent crime
becomes the dominant crime type (in all likelihood as the levels of both decline
generally).
If one were to interpret Cloward and Ohlin's (1960) description of a conflict
subculture as defined solely by violence, then this is not supported in our
results. The void of social organization does not impede nonviolent crime,
perhaps because much crime does not require social networks for illegitimate
learning and opportunities as Cloward and Ohlin (1960) suggested (e.g.,
Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990). Cloward and Ohlin were correct in their assertion
that concentrated disadvantage serves as a general risk for crime (i.e., the
generalized motivation), but apparently so too does social disorganization. Still,
their assertion that social disorganization has a particular tendency to foster
and support violence to a degree greater than other crimes finds support. Given
our focus on violence, we did not attend to their assertions regarding the other
two subcultures (e.g., we did not investigate whether and why drug use might
represent a unique neighborhood subculture). In order to provide a broader
commentary on differential opportunity as a whole, future research could
examine whether Cloward and Ohlin's predictions specifically hold for criminal
and retreatist subcultures as well. This would likely be a productive direction,
since much literature on differential opportunity has largely lumped it in with
790 SCHRECK ET AL.
strain theories and tended to ignore the proposition that the response to strain
is socially structured (Cullen, 1988). By revisiting the unique propositions it
offers with regard to both the volume and type of crime across neighborhoods,
criminology may well find there is something to Cullen's (1988, p. 233) senti-
ment that "Cloward and Ohlin's insights ... are much ado about something."
Still, like any study, this investigation is not without limitations. Accordingly,
we advocate for future research on this topic, both to replicate and expand the
current inquiry. In doing so, scholars should first turn to other locations for
research sites. A good portion of our theoretical and empirical knowledge about
neighborhoods and crime stems from Chicago data and this inquiry joins that
group. Thus, it is limited with regard to external validity, and, since this is the
first inquiry of crime differentials with the current method, it is important to
see whether the results generalize to other locations and contexts. Future
research can also productively expand the scope of predictor variables. Earlier,
we presented research on opportunity factors and crime differentials (e.g.,
Sherman et al., 1989). Future work should focus on how opportunity intersects
with the balance between violence and nonviolence in a neighborhood. We
should also note that this study has not exhausted all of the theoretical possibil-
ities for studying the unique origins of neighborhood violence, relative to other
forms of crime. Depending on the availability of suitable data, scholars could
derive and test additional relevant predictions from subculture of violence
perspectives and strain theories.
Finally, as we noted earlier, our neighborhood crime data come from official
reports. The limitations of official data are well known but they have special
implications for understanding the patterning of crime within the neighbor-
hood. For crimes to "exist," at least for official purposes, someone must
report them to the police. Warner (1992) indicated that the reporting of prop-
erty crime (but not violence) might depend to some degree on neighborhood
disorganization. We do not know if Warner's results persist in Chicago in 1995
and 1996, largely because she indicated in her narrative that crime reporting
might be substantially influenced by period effects attributed to levels of
intensified social conflict between elites and the lower classes during the
Vietnam War and its aftermath (she analyzed 1972 and 1982 crime data). Still,
it is noteworthy that Baumer (2002) recently illustrated that the reporting of
violent crime does not seem to depend on neighborhood characteristics. Neigh-
borhood biases with respect to nonviolent crime reporting remain unknown,
however. Future research should examine neighborhood crime data based upon
a broad range of aggregated self-reports of violent and nonviolent offending or
victimization.
In the end, despite these limitations, our investigation contributes to the
dialogue of macro-level theories of crime, as well as expands knowledge about
crime patterns across space. It joins other work in demonstrating that there are
numerous dimensions of spatial crime patterns, much like there are for individ-
ual-level criminal careers (e.g., Weisburd, Bushway, Lum, & Yang, 2004). We
hope it will spark more specific discussions and inquiries about neighborhood
VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOODS 791
crime profiles that extend past the frequency of crime, since this has clear
impact for both theory and crime control policy.
