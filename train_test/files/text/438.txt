Abstract
Based on the unique longitudinal data of the elderly aged 65+ with a sufficiently large
sub-sample of the oldest-old aged 85+ from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy
Longevity Survey, we construct a resilience scale with 7 indicators for the Chinese
elderly, based on the framework of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Cox
proportional hazards regression model estimates show that, after controlling for socio-
demographic characteristics and initial health status, the total resilience score and most
factors of the resilience scale are significantly associated with reduced mortality risk
among the young-old and oldest-old. Although the causal mechanisms remain to be
investigated, effective measures to promote resilience are likely to have a positive effect
on longevity of the elderly in China.

Shen & Zeng: The association between resilience and survival among Chinese elderly

1. Introduction
Resilience, a psychological construct, has been defined differently in extant literatures.
In this paper, we adopt the straightforward definition specified in Lamond et al. (2009),
that resilience connotes the ability to adapt positively to adversity.
Resilience scores have been demonstrated to be positively correlated with mental
health and physical functioning of the elderly (Wagnild 2003; Hardy, Concato, and Gill
2002), as well as with self-rated successful aging (Lamond et al. 2009) in developed
countries. Other studies have explored how resilience ameliorated the negative effect of
adverse events on health and well-being. For instance, Windle, Woods, and Markland
(2008) discovered that psychological resilience moderated the negative effect of chronic
illness on subjective well-being among the elderly aged 60+ in England. Furthermore,
several researchers have shown that resilient elderly people were more likely to
experience positive emotions (Block and Block 1980; Masten 2001; Ong et al. 2006),
which were found to promote health and longevity (Levy, Slade, and Kasl 2002; Giltay
et al. 2004).
However, three aspects of the previous studies limited the development of research
on resilience in aging. Above all, most of the prior studies were based on small
samples, with especially limited numbers of the oldest-old subjects (Wagnild 2003;
Lamond et al. 2009), which restricted the estimation efficiency. Second, many studies
were cross-sectional (Hardy, Concato, and Gill 2002; Windle, Woods, and Markland
2008; Lamond et al. 2009) and few were based on longitudinal survey data. The cross-
sectional design could not provide time of death, which would be the key to exploring
the association between resilience and survival. Third, almost all previous studies on
this topic dealt with developed countries. However, the elderly populations in
developing countries such as China, South Korea, India, and Mexico are increasing at a
much faster rate and on a much larger scale than that in the developed countries (U.N.
2005). Our current study tried to make contributions in these three aspects to enhance
research on resilience in aging.
2. Data and measurements
The data used in this paper were from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity
Survey (CLHLS). The CLHLS was carried out in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2008-
2009 in a randomly selected half of the counties, smaller cities at county level and
districts under the large cities at prefecture or provincial level in 22 Chinese provinces,
covering 85% of the total population (Zeng et al. 2008). The 1998 baseline and the
Demographic Research: Volume 23, Article 5
http://www.demographic-research.org 107
2000 follow-up waves interviewed the oldest-old aged 80+ only; since the 2002 wave,
younger elderly individuals, aged 65-79, were also included in the sample.
This study was based on the 2002-2005 longitudinal sample to explore the impact
of resilience on survival among the elderly aged 65+ over a 3-year interval. The main
advantage of applying a longitudinal dataset in this study is to learn about the influence
of the resilience on mortality among the elderly who participated in 2002 survey, while
controlling for various confounding factors including initial health status. We excluded
those who were lost to follow-up in the 2005 survey (11.9% of the initial sample) and
the 61 deceased who had missing information on the time of death.3 The final sample
size in this study was 13,800 elderly people, consisting of 5,896 men (42.72%) and
7,904 women (57.28%).
As CLHLS was a demographic survey rather than a specific psychological study,
we did not have as many indicators as the resilience scale typically used in the
psychological studies, such as the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)
proposed by Connor and Davidson (2003). Furthermore, considering that few Chinese
elderly people were Christians, and all of our subjects were not formally employed, the
indicators such as "sometimes fate or God can help", "you work to attain your goals"
and "you prefer to take the lead in problem solving", etc. in CD-RISC were not relevant
in our application. Thus, we selected 7 available items in CLHLS to measure resilience
(See Table 1). The respondents were asked whether the item statements fit them
(denoted as 1) or not (denoted as 0). As questions concerning items 1-4 and item 7 were
regarding feelings about self, and were required to be answered by the elderly person
him/herself in the survey, 13.5% of the respondents were unable to answer these
questions due to poor cognitive capacity. Simply excluding these cases might lead to
sampling bias. Thus we conducted multiple imputations for the missing values of these
five resilience items based on the respondents' age, gender, race, education, physical
and mental health measured by activities of daily living (ADL) and the Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) (Royston 2005). The total resilience scores ranged from 0
to 7, with higher scores reflecting greater resilience.
3 Gu and Zeng (2004) conducted careful evaluation and suggested that sample attrition in CLHLS did not
yield significant bias.

As shown in Table 2, age, race (Han or minority), current residence (urban or
rural), primary occupation before age 60 (non-manual job or manual job), education
(literate or illiterate), and marital status (currently married or not) were included as
socio-demographic controls. Because the follow-up mortality risk and resilience were
both correlated with the initial health status, we further controlled for physical and
mental health status in 2002 (see Table 2). Physical health was measured by ADL,
consisting of eating, dressing, moving around the residence , using the toilet, bathing
and continence. If the individual could complete all six activities without another's
assistance, he/she was classified as "ADL independent"; if the individual needed help in
at least one activity, he/she was classified as "ADL dependent." Mental health was
measured by the MMSE, which included 24 items regarding orientation, registration,
attention, calculation, recall and language, with a total score ranging from 0 to 30. We
used the same cutoff as the MMSE international standard to define a total score 24 as
"normal mental health" and a score <24 as "impaired mental health."

3. Methods
We conducted item-total correlations to test the internal consistency of the resilience
scale as well as principle component analysis to assess its factor composition. We
estimated Cox proportional hazards regression models controlling for the potential
confounding variable to explore the association between resilience and survival of the
elderly. Survival time from the 2002 interview to death (for those died) or to the 2005
interview (for those who survived who were considered as surveyed) was measured in
months. We included the common factors of the resilience scale and the total score of
resilience separately, to examine the impact of each factor and the overall effect of
resilience. To better understand how the impact of resilience on mortality was
moderated by confounding variables, we adopted a step by step approach.
4. Results
The item-total correlations ranged from 0.31 to 0.68, implying that none of the 7 items
should be dropped from the resilience scale (Field 2005). Principle component analysis
generated 3 factors with eigenvalues 1. These 3 factors could be interpreted as
follows: Factor 1 contains 3 items reflecting self-approval, calmness and the social
connection; Factor 2 contains 3 items reflecting close relationship with family and
friends; Factor 3 contains 2 items reflecting optimism and control of own life (Table 3).

The estimates in Tables 4 showed that, without controlling for any confounding
factors, the elderly who were more self-approving, calm and sociable had a 14% lower
mortality risk (Model 1). The effect was ameliorated after adjusting for socio-
demographic characteristics and initial health status (Model 2 and 3), but remained
significant at the P<0.01 level. Close relationship with family and friends significantly
reduced the mortality risk by 13.5% (Model 1). After socio-demographic characteristics
and initial health status were added to the model (Model 2 and 3), intimate relationship
with family and friends reduced the mortality risk by 4.0-7.0%, and both estimates were
highly significant. However, optimism and control of own life had no significant impact
on mortality risk with and without controlling for other covariates (Model 1-3).

As shown in the Model 1 in Table 5, without controlling for any covariates, the
elderly with a high total resilience score (6) were faced with 31.5% lower mortality
risk, as compared to those with a lower resilience score (<6). After adjusting for various
covariates including physical and mental health, higher resilience reduced mortality risk
at old ages by 9.2% and the estimate was still highly significant (Model 3 in Table 5). It
was clear that a large part of the effect of resilience was moderated by socio-
demographic characteristics and initial health status.

Notes: the same as in Table 4
In order to explore differences in relationship between resilience and survival
among different age ranges, we further conducted survival analyses among the young-
old aged 65-84 and oldest-old aged 85+ separately, while also controlling for single-
year-age (Model 4 and 5 in Table 5). As compared to the young-old, the positive effect
of high resilience on mortality was somewhat smaller among the oldest-old, and it was
highly significant among both the young-old and oldest-old (P< 0.01).
5. Discussion and conclusions
The present study was unique as it explored the association between resilience and
longevity at old ages based on the unique longitudinal data with a sufficiently large sub-
sample of the oldest-old in a developing country. Survival analyses showed that the
total resilience score and most factors of the resilience scale had significantly positive
Shen & Zeng: The association between resilience and survival among Chinese elderly
112 http://www.demographic-research.org
impacts on longevity of the elderly, after controlling for socio-demographic
characteristics and initial health status. The effect of resilience on survival among the
young-old was somewhat larger than that among the oldest-old.
Although to our knowledge, few published studies have explored the relationship
between resilience and survival, previous studies obtained comparable findings that
resilient elderly have better mental health and physical function in developed countries
(Wagnild 2003; Hardy, Concato, and Gill 2002). Resilience is considered as an
important attribute in recovery from illness and other stressful event (Hardy, Concato,
and Gill 2002; Lamond et al. 2009). When individuals reach advanced ages,
accumulated negative conditions throughout the long process of aging, such as health
deterioration and the loss of loved family members, represent serious challenges. The
elderly of better resilience may have stronger capacity and potential for dealing
successfully with constraints and adversity (Jopp and Rott 2006) to gain better health
and longevity. The findings from the present study are in general consistent with the
findings from the western world, which indicates that resilience performs as a source of
protection for the elderly in both developing and developed countries.
Why was resilience positively associated with survival at old ages in China? One
possible explanation was that resilience was positively correlated with better health, and
better health lowered the mortality risk. This hypothesis was supported through our
survival analyses, which showed that the effects of each resilience factor as well as the
total resilience score on mortality risk shrank substantially after variables of initial
health status entered the model. Prior investigations also lent support to this explanation
(Wagnild 2003; Lamond et al. 2009; Ong et al. 2006). However, our analysis
demonstrated that, even after controlling for the initial health status, the protective
effects of the total resilience score and most of the resilience factors on mortality risk
still remained significant. These results indicated that resilience may have independent
effects on mortality risk.
The findings presented in this paper should be interpreted with caution given the
limitations of our study. First, as the CLHLS was a demographic survey focusing on
demographic characteristics, socio-economic status, life style, health status and
mortality risk of the elderly, we did not have as many resilience indicators as specific
psychological surveys did. Second, we have only examined the association between
resilience and mortality, but we were unable to explore the causal relationship and the
detailed mechanisms on how resilience works, due to data limitations. More detailed
data and advanced methods such as instrumental analysis are called for to explore the
causal relationship and the mechanisms in further studies.
In conclusion, the present study provided evidence to support the conclusion that
better resilience was associated with reduced mortality risk among the young-old and
oldest-old in a developing country, China. Policies aiming to promote resilience such as
Demographic Research: Volume 23, Article 5

organizing group activities and encouraging individual expression (Waaktaar et al.
2004) are likely to have long-reaching effects on longevity of the elderly.
