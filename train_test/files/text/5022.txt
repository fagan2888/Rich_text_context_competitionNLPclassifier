Post-Disaster Housing Reconstruction
in Sri Lanka
The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, which was a result of the fifth
largest earthquake of the last century, caused great devastation
in Sri Lanka, making more than 1,000,000 people homeless. The
task of reconstruction after the 2004 tsunami was an onerous
challenge to a developing country like Sri Lanka, which required
the deliberate and coordinated efforts of all stakeholders for
effective and efficient recovery of the affected community. This
resulted in a large number of post-disaster housing reconstruction
(PDHR) projects. A wide array of stakeholders came together on
such projects to execute the final outcome. In the aftermath of
early reconstruction efforts, dissatisfaction was expressed by some
stakeholders. The areas of criticism included time, cost, quality,
coordination with infrastructure, and linkage to livelihoods (Haigh
& Amaratunga, 2010; Hidellage & Pullenayegem, 2008;
Karunasena & Rameezdeen, 2010; Keraminiyage, Amaratunga,
& Haigh, 2008; Lyons, 2009; Mulligan & Shaw, 2007; Nissanka,
Karunasena, & Rameezdeen, 2008; Perry, 2007; Ratnayake &
Rameezdeen, 2008). Nevertheless, the reconstruction provided an
opportunity for the development of Sri Lanka. Thus, the industry
sector of Gross National Product before and after the 2004 tsu-
nami stood at 5.4 and 8.0, respectively. This was mainly due to
the growth of housing output. Moreover, several acts stipulate
that housing is one of the three basic requirements necessary for
a standard of living and personal security. Furthermore, Nissanka
et al. (2008) and Ratnayake and Rameezdeen (2008) identified
stakeholder expectations in PDHR as an under-researched
domain and where further in-depth studies are required. Only a
few studies have been carried out to explore the expectations and
of stakeholders caught up in disasters in Sri Lanka.Accordingly,
this study was undertaken to achieve the objectives as stated in
the section "Aim, Objectives, and Research Questions," using an
appropriate methodology.

Post-Disaster Housing Reconstruction in
Sri Lanka: What Methodology?
Nuwani Amaratunga1, Richard Haigh2, and Bingunath Ingirige3
Abstract
Research methodology is the procedural framework within which the research is conducted. This includes the overall
approach to a problem that could be put into practice in a research process, from the theoretical underpinning to the
collection and analysis of data. Choice of methodology depends on the primary drivers: topic to be researched and the
specific research questions. Hence, methodological perspectives of managing stakeholder expectations of PDHR context
are composed of research philosophies, research strategy, research design, and research techniques. This research belonged
to social constructivism or interpretivism within a philosophical continuum. The nature of the study was more toward
subjectivism where human behavior favored voluntary stance. Ontological, methodological, epistemological, and axiological
positioning carried the characteristics of idealism, ideographic, anti-positivism, and value laden, respectively. Data collection
comprises two phases, preliminary and secondary. Exploratory interviews with construction experts in the United Kingdom
and Sri Lanka were carried out to refine the interview questions and identify the case studies. Case study interviews during
the secondary phase took place in Sri Lanka. Data collected at the preliminary stage were used to assess the attributes of
power, legitimacy/proximity, and urgency of stakeholders to the project using Stakeholder CircleTM software. Moreover,
the data collected at secondary phase via case studies will be analyzed with NVivo 8. This article aims to discuss these
methodological underpinnings in detail applied in a post-disaster housing reconstruction context in Sri Lanka.

What Is Research Methodology?
Saunders, Lewis, and Thornhill (2009) describe that methods
are techniques and procedures used to obtain and analyze
data, and methodology is the theory of how research should
be undertaken. However, Oliver (2008) included both theo-
retical and practical matters of data collection in the term
methodology. The Oxford Dictionary definition uses the
term method, to represent both the terms: method and meth-
odology. It states that "a method is a way or order of doing
something where theory and practice of acting in which the
actor seeks to achieve a true interpretation of his part by
mentally identifying himself with the character he is play-
ing." Therefore, it can be concluded that methodology is an
umbrella term where methods are a part.
Aim, Objectives, and Research Questions
The aim of this research is to explore and investigate how to
identify, classify, capture, and address the needs of stake-
holders, and manage their expectations of reconstruction
projects, to deliver effective PDHR in Sri Lanka.Accordingly,
the following objectives and questions were devised
(Table 1).
Research problems lay the foundation for the decision of
selecting an appropriate philosophy, which is discussed in
the section "Research Positioning."
A research paradigm is a philosophical framework that
guides how research should be conducted, based on people's
philosophies and their assumptions about the world and the
nature of the knowledge (Collis & Hussey, 2009). They
introduce philosophies as the use of reason and argument in
seeking truth. Thus, any research would belong to a philoso-
phy. Research positioning in Figure 1 is the diagrammatic
representation of this premise.
Research Positioning
Easterby-Smith, Thorpe, and Lowe (2012) identify research
philosophies as the base for effective research design and argue
that failure to adhere to philosophical issues can affect the qual-
ity of the research negatively. They highlight three important
reasons behind understanding philosophical issues in the
research process. First, it helps to clarify the research design.
Second, it helps the researcher to identify which research
designs will work and which research designs will not work
under different circumstances. Finally, it helps the researcher to
identify and create research designs that may be outside his
past experience. Furthermore, it may also suggest how to use
different research designs within different subject areas and dif-
ferent knowledge structures. Figure 1 diagrammatically posi-
tions the research in a philosophical continuum.
Social science is a branch of science that studies society
and the relationships of individuals within a society. It
extends its knowledge toward human behavior and its impact
on the outside world. Society does indeed possess an objec-
tive facility and is built up by subjective meaning. Research
on managing stakeholder expectations in PDHR revolves
around "human relationships," and PDHR activities include
a socio-psychosocial element, which has a link to the outside
world. Therefore, this research belongs to social sciences.
This study combines the views of Burrell and Morgan
(1979) with Collins (1998) and Guba and Lincoln (1998).
Burrell and Morgan (1998) have stipulated four sets of
assumptions: ontology, epistemology, human nature, and
methodology. Collins and Guba and Lincoln underline axiol-
ogy in their assumptions apart from ontology and epistemol-
ogy. Accordingly, this research takes an account of human
nature, ontology, methodology, epistemology, axiology, and
the nature of the society. These help to position the research
within the philosophical continuum, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Objectivity and subjectivity. If the reality is an observable phe-
nomena, with evidence it is said to be objective. The other
extreme of the continuum, subjectivity, refers to the percep-
tion of reality by individuals, which is influenced by per-
sonal beliefs. Thus, Saunders et al. (2009) assessed that
social entities exist in a reality external to social actors.
Disasters triggered by natural hazards are most of the time
unpredictable and do not exist to be perceived objectively.
However, man-made and human-induced disasters are not
unexpected all the time. The PDHR process, procedures, and
policies, however, are regularized but subject to change.
Therefore, the study is more toward subjective axis of the
continuum.
Human nature.Human nature is the subject and object of
enquiry (Burrell & Morgan, 1979). These can identify the
perspectives in social science, which entail a view of human
beings responding in a mechanistic or even deterministic
fashion to the situations encountered in the external world
(Burrell & Morgan, 1979). Human beings cannot be divorced
from their natural environment. For example, during PDHR,
a variety of stakeholders emerge. Thus, these stakeholder
expectations vary from each other. This may depend on the
type of house they received, education and socio-economic
background, values, and attitudes. Human behavior in the
social scientific theory too varies between determinism and
voluntarism (Burrell & Morgan, 1979). Deterministic nature
depends completely on the situation, environment, or the
organizational factors, which affects the behavior and activi-
ties of a human being. In voluntarism, it is expected that the
human enjoys the autonomy and is free willed.
If PDHR is taken as a situation, the strategies to manage
the stakeholder expectations are determined partly by free
will and partly by the government and organizational/project
policies and procedures. Nevertheless, voluntary mecha-
nisms could emerge because of the urgent and chaotic atmo-
sphere after a disaster. It can be concluded that human nature
in this study is a blend of determinism and voluntarism.
Ontology. Ontology refers to the assumptions that we make
about the nature of reality (Easterby-Smith et al., 2012).
Social scientists are faced with a basic ontological question:
whether the "reality" to be investigated is external to the
individual--imposing itself on individual consciousness
from without--or whether it is a product of individual con-
sciousness; whether "reality" is objective nature or the prod-
uct of individual cognition; or whether reality is given out
there in the world or the product of one's mind (Burrell &
Morgan, 1979).
Burrell and Morgan (1979) hold a viewpoint on realism,
which is at one end of ontology that social world is external
to individual cognition and is a real world made up of tangi-
ble and relatively immutable structures. The individual is
seen as being born into a living, within a social world that has
a reality of its own, which exists out there. Idealists believe
that reality is made up of ideas or thoughts and individuals
have differing viewpoints. Thus, what counts for truth can
vary from place to place and from time to time. Hence,
names, concepts, and labels created are regarded as artificial
creations whose utility is based on convenience for descrip-
tion, making sense and negotiation in the external world
(Burrell & Morgan, 1979). Accordingly, Morgan and
Smircich (1980) recently developed a six-way classification
of the nature of the social world: reality as a concrete struc-
ture, reality as a concrete process, reality as a contextual field
of information, reality as symbolic discourse, reality as social
construction, and reality as projection of human imagination.
Reality as a social construction is the most suited classifica-
tion to this research due to the reasons stated below.
In this study, identification and classification of stake-
holders of PDHR, exploring their relationships based on
salience, and strategies to manage the expectations depend-
ing on the type of housing project, are perceived differently
depending on the situation and usage. The researcher ana-
lyzed the subject matters by being an observer of the project.
Furthermore, the research environment is not expected to
control and simplify with assumptions. Thus, observation
partially contributes in developing explanations and theories
in relation to PDHR in Sri Lanka. Hence, this research favors
idealism.
Method. Methodology is the technique used by the researcher
to investigate the reality and obtain the knowledge (Burrell
& Morgan, 1979; Healy & Perry, 2000). Carter and Little
(2007) explained it as theory and analysis of how research
should proceed. As such, for this study, it is presumed to be
the process by which the research is carried out.

continuum.

The philosophical underpinning of methodology falls
between Nomothetic and Ideographic stances. Nomothetic
theory depends on the scientific method, where the researcher
follows a protocol and testing of hypotheses by using quanti-
tative techniques. The ideographic approach assumes that
one can understand the social world only by obtaining first-
hand knowledge of the subject under investigation.
Gill and Johnson (2002) present a comparison between
the Nomothetic (realist) and Ideographic (idealism) method-
ologies, as summarized in Table 2.
Accordingly, this research requires the researcher to be a
part of the environment, and interaction with the stakehold-
ers is needed to unearth the viewpoints in relation to PDHR
projects. In this process, it is important to identify stakehold-
ers of PDHR projects and the strategies to manage the expec-
tations of different type of housing projects. Hence, the
researcher cannot be an independent actor from the context.
Furthermore, the research necessitates an in-depth analysis
to gather detailed facts about the research environment.
However, this study favors social constructivism and takes
an ideographic stance.
Epistemology. This is the relationship between that reality and
the researcher (Healy & Perry, 2000). Burrell and Morgan
(1979) perceived it as how one might understand the world
and communicate this knowledge to fellow human beings. A
question can be posed as to whether the knowledge can be
acquired or it has to be personally experienced. In other
words, what constitutes acceptable knowledge, either past or
present, in a field of study?
Positivism is based on the assumption that there are uni-
versal laws that govern social events, and uncovering these
laws enables researchers to describe, predict, and control
social phenomena (Wardlow, 1989). Positivism assumes
implicitly or explicitly that reality can be measured by view-
ing it through a one-way, value-free mirror (Healy & Perry,
2000). In positivism, the researcher can replicate the findings
and emphasize on quantifiable observations that lend them-
selves to statistical analysis (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill,
2007). As Burrell and Morgan (1979) explain, anti-
positivism has different forms such as hermeneutics, inter-
pretive structuralist perspective but firmly set against utility
of laws or underlying regularities. In contrast, this study was
subject to underlying laws and regulation of PDHR in Sri
Lanka. Furthermore, they state that social world is relativis-
tic and can only be understood from the point of view of the
individual who are directly involved in the activities to be
studied. Also anti-positivistic researchers reject the stand-
point of the "observer," a position that characterizes positiv-
istic study.
Social constructionists believe that the reality is socially
constructed, where differing viewpoints have emerged. Thus,
positivists believe that observer must be independent, human
interset must be irreevant, explanations demonstrate causalty,
resaerch progresses through hypotheses and deduction, con-
cepts need to be operationalized where these can be mea-
sured, units of analysis should be reduced to the simplest
terms, generalisation through statistical probability, sam-
pling is required where large numbers are selected randomly
(Easterby-Smith et al., 2012). According to Easterby-Smith
et al., (2012) in social constuctionism observer is a part of
what is being observed, human interests are the main drivers
of the science, explanations aim to increase general under-
standing of the situation, research progresses through gather-
ing rich data where ideas are induced, concepts should
incorporate stakeholder perspectives, units of analysis may
include the compexity of "whole" situation, generalisation
through theoretical abstraction and sampling requires small
number of cases chosen for specific reasons. These set the
scene for main differences between positivism and social
constructionism in this research too.
By considering the aforementioned characteristics, a
social constructionism approach has been deemed to be more
appropriate to this research than a positivist philosophy.
Berger and Luckmann (1967) viewed that social constructiv-
ism as a blend of a social reality and symbolic interaction,
where the reality we collectively experience has, in fact,
been constructed by our social interactions. As set out in the
"Aim, Objectives, and Research Questions" section, this
research aimed to explore how to identify, classify, and man-
age stakeholder expectations, so that construction enterprises
can deliver effective disaster housing reconstruction in Sri
Lanka, which necessitates the researcher to be a part of the
environment. Thus, it is the journey of creating the reality
with and through relationships or interactions (with stake-
holders) of the external environment, as it is believed that

reality is multiple, and there is no pre-existing reality. As
such, it invalidates embracing a strong positivist approach.
Axiology.Axiology discusses the values that are attached to
knowledge and help to determine what are recognized as
facts and the interpretations that are drawn from them (Collis
& Hussey, 2009). Positivists believe that science and the pro-
cess of research is value free, in contrast to the social con-
structionists' viewpoint of research, which accepts values. In
value-free research, the choice of what to study and how to
study is determined by objective criteria, while in value-
laden research, the choice is determined by human beliefs
and experiences (Easterby-Smith et al., 2012). As this
research is of an exploratory nature and interpretation of
stakeholders forms a major component of understanding the
reality, it is value laden. Hence, a social constructionist
approach is more suitable.
Research on stakeholder expectations in a PDHR scenario
revolves around human (stakeholders) and organizational
activities (strategies and mechanisms), and thereby can be
found under the social science end of the research contin-
uum. The research is positioned within the philosophical
continuum in terms of human nature, ontology, epistemol-
ogy, methodology, and axiological assumptions. To capture
the reality (ontology) and human nature, certain methodolo-
gies should be used. However, the tool of acquisition and
dissemination of knowledge (epistemology) is the methodol-
ogy. The assumptions can be placed on two extreme ends,
depending on the objective or subjective nature of the study.
Positioning of this study is not completely at one end because
a subjective as well as objective element is embedded in the
philosophical assumptions.
Research Strategy
Research strategy describes the directions or ways in which
research is conducted (Remenyi, Williams, Money, &
Swartz, 2003). A method is a way or order of doing some-
thing in theory and practice, whereby the actor seeks to
"achieve a true interpretation of his part by mentally identi-
fying himself with the character he is playing" (Oxford
English Dictionary, 1989). Hence research methods refer to
ways of testing the validity of phenomena, or theory(ies) or
hypothesis(es). Yin (2009) identifies three conditions that
have to be considered when selecting the appropriate research
strategy. They are the type of research question posed, the
extent of control an investigator has over the actual behav-
ioral events, and the degree of focus on contemporary event.
Research strategy also depends on the philosophical stances
on human nature, ontology, methodology, epistemology, and
axiology. The research on managing stakeholder expectations
of post-disaster housing projects in Sri Lanka favors social
constructivism as the research can be positioned due to the
subjective nature of the study. In addition to the research ques-
tions and objectives, and the philosophical underpinnings of
the research, the choice of research strategy will be directed
by the extent of existing knowledge, and the amount of time
and other resources available (Saunders et al., 2009).
Research strategies commonly used by business and man-
agement researchers are experiment, survey, case study,
action research, and ethnography (Easterby-Smith et al.,
2012; Remenyi et al., 2003; Saunders et al., 2009).
Experiment and survey methods reside closer to the posi-
tivism end of the continuum. Experiments are widely used in
natural science research where a test of hypothesis, theory,
and law are involved. An experiment involves controlling
one "input" variable, holding all others constant (to the best
of your ability), and measuring the effect on an output vari-
able of a change in the control variable. Stakeholder expecta-
tions of PDHR cannot be tested in a laboratory environment
and cannot be manipulated. Thus, this strategy is not appro-
priate for this study. However, a survey does not need a con-
trolled environment. The meaning of results from a survey
will be enhanced if an analysis plan is generated prior to data
collection; then interpretations of the results will more likely
be a reflection of patterns in the data and a basis for knowing
more about the essential "what is" of the world being sur-
veyed. However, research on stakeholder expectations in
PDHR requires in-depth study of construction project stake-
holders. The survey method is therefore not a compatible
option. In action research, the researcher tries to solve the
problem by being a part within the problem environment
with the goal to change the status quo of the situation by
changing attitudes or the behavior of participants (Waser &
Johns, 2003). This needs partial control of the environment,
again making it unsuitable.
Ethnography is a holistic research method where the
researcher becomes a part and parcel of the environment
being studied as a participant observer interacting with social
groups. These observations and interactions enable the eth-
nographer to understand how the group develops a skein of
relations and cultural constructions that tie it together over a
prolonged period of time. The time factor and the need to be
a participant observer are significant constraints that prevent
its use for this study. Due to the constraints stated, the most
appropriate approach for this research is case studies. Yin
(2009) defines a case study as "an empirical inquiry that
investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real life
context, especially when the boundaries between phenome-
non and context are not clearly evident." Both "what" type of
exploratory questions and "why" types of explanatory ques-
tions are covered by this approach. Research on stakeholder
expectations from construction projects, in the context of
PDHR, does not intend to control/manipulate the environ-
ment under examination and does not intend to interfere with
the attitudes, perceptions, or the procedures of the environ-
ment (as in the case of action research), but does analyze
contemporary events and requires an in-depth study on the
selected environment. It will be advantageous to rely on mul-
tiple sources of evidence, and the selection of a small sample
6 SAGE Open
to allow an in-depth study requires exploring and analyzing
the "real-life" context of stakeholder expectation of disaster
reconstruction. Therefore, case study qualifies as the most
appropriate strategy. Accordingly, the case study design is
explained in the next section.
Research Design
Yin (2009) created a 2 × 2 matrix for the basic types of case
study designs, determining the choice between single versus
multiple case studies and a holistic versus embedded unit of
analysis. A single case study is appropriate over a multiple
case when the circumstances are critical, unique, representa-
tive, revelatory, or longitudinal. The study in question does not
fall under these categories, and thus multiple case studies are
preferred over a single case study. Multiple case studies pro-
vide a rich ground for the usage of replication logic through
multiple sources of evidence. Literature review supports the-
ory building via research questions. Thus, multiple case stud-
ies will verify them. It is intended to claim literal replication
by comparing the findings from the multiple case studies, and
the study in question addresses generalization through analyti-
cal generalization, rather than statistical generalization.
The second choice between holistic versus embedded
case study designs is based on the selection of the unit of
analysis of the study. The research questions of the study
mainly reflect the requirement of delivering stakeholder
expectations, in PDHR leaving stakeholder expectation as
the main unit of analysis and housing reconstruction projects
form the boundary of the study. The research questions are
composed of "what" type of exploratory questions and
"how" type of explanatory questions. However, the objec-
tives on the whole are of an exploratory nature. Hence, the
design adopted in this study is multiple, holistic exploratory
case studies. The next section elaborates on the research
techniques used in the case study.
Research Techniques
Research techniques can be described under two major
phases of the study: the data collection and data analysis
techniques.
Data Collection Techniques
Three principles for data collection can be identified in case
study research (Yin, 2009). The first principle emphasizes the
importance of multiple sources of evidence, where six sources
of data collection have been identified. Those are documents,
archival records, interviews, direct observation, participant
observation, and physical artifacts. The rationale for using the
multiple sources of evidence has been described as the
Triangulation (Yin, 2009). Data triangulation eliminates
problems related to construct validity that is an important
aspect when determining the quality of case study research.
Yin (2009) further states the fact that, the benefits from the
above six sources of evidence can be maximized, if the two
principles--to create a case study database and to maintain a
chain of evidence--are adhered to. The main purpose of the
case study database is that it provides the critical reader with
an opportunity to go back to the raw data as and when required
(Yin, 2009). The chain of evidence makes the case study more
reliable where the case study reviewer is allowed to follow the
derivation of the evidence from the research question forma-
tion to the case study conclusions.
Data collection comprises two phases, preliminary and
secondary. Exploratory interviews with construction experts
in the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka were carried out to
refine the interview questions and identify the case studies.
Case study interviews during the secondary phase took place
in Sri Lanka.
Data collected at the preliminary stage was used to assess
the attributes of power, legitimacy/proximity, and urgency of
stakeholders to the project using Stakeholder CircleTM soft-
ware. Moreover, the data collected at secondary phase via
case studies will be analyzed with NVivo 8.
Coding of textual data collected from interviews were
carried out through content analysis. This is a method that
compresses many words into fewer content categories
(Krippendorff, 1980). Guthrie and Abeysekera (2006) eluci-
date that it involves codifying qualitative and quantitative
information into pre-defined categories to derive patterns in
the presentation and reporting of information. Furthermore,
Guthrie and Mathews (1985) noted that, content analysis has
been widely used in corporate social responsibility (CSR)
and corporate governance (CG) research (Ryan & Ng, 2000).
Cognitive mapping was used to display and identify relation-
ships of concepts derived from interviews and observations.
Conclusion
Research methodology is the key to conduct a social research.
Research philosophies are the core to a seminal piece of
research. The discussion on Post-Disaster Housing
Reconstruction in Sri Lanka: What Methodology? has identi-
fied social constructivism or interpretivism as the best-suited
philosophy. Multiple, holistic case studies form the research
strategy. Pilot interviews with experts who got involved in
PDHR projects are used to formulate the research questions,
and case study interviews were conducted to validate the
same. Data analysis will be carried out in aid of software,
NVivo 8 and Stakeholder CircleTM.
