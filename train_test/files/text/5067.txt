Introduction
The renin­angiotensin system (RAS) is well known to play
an important role in the initiation and amplification of ather-
osclerosis damage that clinically results in cardiovascular
disease. In previous studies1 we demonstrated that in patients
with unstable angina the cardiac RAS is activated and sus-
tains an increased de novo production of cardiac angiotensin
(Ang) II. Upregulated cardiac RAS participates in the coro-
nary microvessel inflammation of unstable angina and
strengthens the immunomediated component of myocardial
inflammation. Indeed, in unstable angina myocardium-
positive immunostaining for angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) co-localised with T cells and endothelial cells. In
agreement with this finding, experimental and human stud-
ies showed that Ang II may be produced by T cells that are
fully equipped with RAS components and specifically can
express the gene for key components of the RAS, such as
ACE and angiotensinogen.2­4 According to these findings,
Ang II acts on and is produced by inflammatory cells,5 can
affect T-cell behaviour by angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1-

Abstract
Introduction: Unstable angina is associated with an acute systemic inflammatory reaction and circulating T lymphocytes
are activated. We investigated whether in unstable angina with marked immune system activation a selective upregulation
of the circulating T-cell renin­angiotensin system, modulated by angiotensin II, could occur.
Methods: We studied 13 unstable angina patients, 10 patients with stable angina and 10 healthy subjects. After
T-lymphocyte isolation, mRNAs for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1-R)
were quantified at baseline and after angiotensin II stimulation. ACE activity in cell pellet and supernatant and angiotensin
II cell content were measured.
Results: Plasma renin activity was similar in controls, stable and unstable angina patients. At baseline ACE and AT1-R
mRNA levels were higher (P<0.05) in T cells from unstable angina patients than in T cells from stable angina patients and
controls, and further increased after angiotensin II addition to cultured T cells. ACE activity of unstable angina T cells
was significantly higher than that of T cells from controls and stable angina patients. Only in T cells from unstable angina
patients did angiotensin II stimulation cause the almost complete release of ACE activity in the supernatant.
Conclusions: The circulating T-cell-based renin­angiotensin system from unstable angina patients was selectively
upregulated. In vivo unstable angina T cells could locally increase angiotensin II concentration in tissues where they
migrate independently of the circulating renin­angiotensin system.

autonomous from circulating and various tissue-based RAS
and can synthesise Ang II that acts as a positive feedback
loop on inflammatory cells to amplify the inflammatory
reaction further.7­9 In our previous paper we showed that in
hypertensive patients with low grade inflammation the T-cell
RAS response to Ang II is amplified in comparison with T
cells from controls and hypertensive individuals without
inflammation. Our findings gave strong support to the
hypothesis that T-cell RAS activity was strictly related to
inflammatory lymphocyte activation. In unstable angina
patients, circulating T cells are activated and sustain the
acute systemic inflammation that precipitates plaque insta-
bility. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is
a sensitive indicator of inflammation, which is closely related
to the progress of plaque and markedly increases in acute
coronary syndrome (ACS). The increase in hs-CRP is slight
or absent in patients with stable coronary plaques. Up to
now, no data are available about the behaviour of circulating
T-cell RAS of patients withACS or stable angina. This study
was aimed at investigating whether an activation of cell-
based RAS could be present in circulating T cells from
patients with unstable or stable angina with increased or nor-
mal hs-CPR levels. We also investigated whether in vitro the
addition of Ang II could stimulate or inhibit cultured T-cell
RAS from unstable or stable angina patients.
Materials and methods
We examined 13 patients with unstable angina in classes
IIB (n=5) and IIIB (n=8) and 10 patients with stable angina
in Canadian classes II (n=4) and III (n=6), who had been
admitted to the cardiological intensive therapy unit of
Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy.
We excluded those patients on ACE inhibitors and/or
Ang II receptor antagonists and those with acute or chronic
diseases accompanied by evidence of circulating RAS acti-
vation. Ten subjects in apparent good health comparable for
age and sex to unstable and stable angina patients formed
the control group.
The protocol of the study complies with the principle of
the Helsinki declaration and was approved by the ethical
committee of our institution. All patients gave written
informed consent to participate and to have blood samples
taken for the study.
The main demographic and clinical characteristics of
enrolled patients are shown in Table 1.
Experimental procedures
T-lymphocyte isolation
Venous blood was drawn from the antecubital vein, col-
lected in a sterile flask containing 3.8% sodium citrate
(9/1, vol/vol); the method for T-lymphocyte isolation was
detailed in our previous report.6 Magnetic beads conju-
gated with antihuman CD 3 (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany)
were used for the positive selection of T lymphocytes. In
each incubation experiment mRNA expression of ACE,
AT1-R, IFN- and ACE activity and Ang II concentrations
were evaluated in T-cell pellets. ACE activity was also
investigated in the supernatants, because ACE can be shed
by T cells.6 To study the effect of stimulation by Ang II on
ACE and AT1-R T-cell gene expression, ACE activity and
Ang II concentrations, T lymphocytes had been cultured in
a cell incubator in humidified atmosphere with 5% carbon
dioxide for 6, 18 or 24 hours, with and without the addition
of 10­13.5 M/ml Ang II to the culture medium.

(ACE Hs00174179_m1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) and for the housekeeping gene -actin
(Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) were used. ACE gene expression
was calculated as 2Ct (Ct
= Ct
of the target gene minus Ct
of -actin); mRNAs for AT1-R and IFN- were semi-
quantified versus the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT­PCR) (Applied
Biosystems) using specific primers at annealing tempera-
ture and cycle number as reported in Table 2.
Measurement of pellet and supernatant ACE
activity
T-cell ACE activity was measured by the quantification of
hippuric acid, produced during the enzymatic reaction of
ACE on a synthetic substrate hippuryl­histidyl­leucine
and assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis using a spectrophotometric detector at
228 nm absorbance as previously described.6 Ang II levels
were expressed as fmol/mg proteins.
Measurement of plasma renin activity, Ang II
and hs-CRP
Plasma renin activity (PRA) measurement was performed
with a commercial kit (Sorin Biomedica, Saluggia,
Vicenza, Italy). Ang II levels were determined by radio-
immunoassay after C18 Sep-Pak cartridge extraction
and HPLC separation and were expressed as fmol/mg
proteins.6 hs-CRP was measured by a commercial kit
(Beckman, Brea, CA, USA) with the lowest detection
point of 0.1 mg/dl.
Statistical analysis
Data have been stored in a dedicated database and ana-
lysed by IBM-SPSS 20 for Windows statistical software
(IBM-SPSS Inc., USA). Variables were reported as
mean±SD and frequencies (percentage). Between-groups
gender comparison was assessed with the chi-square test.
Within-groups comparisons (data with and without Ang II
stimulus ) were made by paired Student's t-test analysis. In
order to analyse differences in ACE and AT1-R gene
expression and ACE activity throughout the time course
among the three groups, an analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used. Statistical significance was taken as P<0.05 for
all calculations.
Results
PRA and hs-CRP in controls, stable and
unstable angina patients
In control subjects, PRA in venous blood was 10.5±1.5
pmol/L per minute (range 4.5­15.2 pmol/L per minute).
PRA levels in stable and unstable angina patients were
9.8±1.2 pmol/L per minute (range 4.4­14.7 pmol/L per
minute) and 10.4±1.7 pmol/L per minute (range 4.0­15.8
pmol/L per minute), respectively, without significant dif-
ferences among groups.
hs-CRP was significantly higher in unstable in stable
angina patients and controls (Table 1).
T-cell IFN- gene expression with and without
Ang II stimulation
T cells from UApatients showed an IFN- gene expression
significantly higher (P<0.01) than those of T cells from
controls and stable angina patients (densitometric ratio
mRNA/mRNA GAPDH 1.37±0.29 vs. 0.71±0.16 and
0.68±0.13, respectively) (Figure 3).
The addition of Ang II to the T-cell culture was associ-
ated with a significant increase in control and stable angina
T-cell IFN- mRNA levels, which peaked at the 24th hour
without differences between the two groups. Twenty-four
hours after Ang II stimulation the increase in IFN- mRNA
levels in unstable angina T cells was significantly higher
(P<0.01) than those observed in T cells from controls and

T-cell ACE and AT1-R gene expression from
controls, stable and unstable angina patients
with and without Ang II stimulation
In T cells from controls ACE gene expression was detect-
able at baseline and did not significantly change at 18 and
24 hours of cell incubation. The addition of 10­13.5 M/ml
Ang II to the culture medium caused a significant (P<0.01
vs. no Ang II stimulus) increase in the T-cell ACE mRNA
level at the 24th hour of incubation (Figure 1). Similarly,
T-cell AT1-R gene expression was detectable under base-
line conditions and did not significantly modify at 18 and
24 hours of incubation without the addition of Ang II, but
significantly increased (P<0.01 vs. no Ang II stimulus) at
the 24th hour when T lymphocytes were stimulated by
Ang II (Figure 2).
In stable angina patients T-cell ACE gene expression
was detectable at baseline, did not change throughout cell
incubation and was significantly higher (P<0.05) than that
observed in the control group. The addition ofAng II to the
culture medium caused a significant (P<0.01 vs, no Ang II
stimulus) increase in the T-cell ACE mRNA level that

peaked at the 24th hour (Figure 1). Similarly, T-cell AT1-R
gene expression was detectable under baseline, did not sig-
nificantly modify in the absence of Ang II stimulus but
significantly increased (P<0.01 vs. no Ang II stimulus) 24
hours after Ang II addition (Figure 2). The pattern of T-cell
ACE and AT1-R gene expression did not differ between
controls and stable angina patients.
At baseline unstable angina T cells showed signifi-
cantly higher (P<0.001) ACE and AT1-R mRNA levels
than those expressed by T cells from controls and stable
angina patients. Unstable angina T cells, ACE and AT1-R
mRNA levels further increased (P<0.001 vs. no Ang II
stimulation) after Ang II addition; the highest peak value
for ACE mRNA was observed at the 18th hour and for
AT1-R gene at the 24th hour.
ACE activity and Ang II concentration in T
cells from controls, stable and unstable angina
patients
At baseline, ACE activity was detectable and similar in T
cells from controls and stable angina patients; Ang II stim-
ulation induced in both groups a significant increase in
pellet ACE activity that peaked at the 24th hour and was
associated with the release of about 35% of total activity
into the supernatant without differences between the two
groups (Table 3).
Unstable angina T-cell pellet ACE activity was signifi-
cantly higher (P<0.01) than that found in T cells from con-
trol subjects and stable angina patients and further
increased after Ang II stimulation that determined an
almost complete release of enzymatic activity in the super-
natant (Table 3).
The Ang II concentration in the pellet of T cells from
controls and stable angina patients was detectable under
baseline conditions, did not change throughout the 24
hours of incubation, but significantly increased at the 24th
hour after Ang II addition. In cultured unstable angina T
cells the Ang II concentration was significantly higher
(P<0.01) than that assayed in controls and stable angina
patients, both at baseline and after Ang II stimulation
(Table 3).
Discussion
Our data show that in unstable angina patients with high hs-
CRP levels but not in stable angina patients with low hs-
CRP levels, circulating T-cell RAS was upregulated under
baseline conditions, independently of Ang II stimulation.
The exaggerated upregulation of unstable angina T-cell
RAS was mainly sustained by the high levels of ACE gene
expression and resulted in a marked increase in T-cell ACE
activity and Ang II concentration associated with an
increased baseline AT1-R gene expression. In T cells from
stable angina patients a slight increase in ACE gene expres-
sion was found, but it did not result in higher ACE activity.
Stimulation of unstable angina cultured T-cell RAS by Ang
II further amplified the T-cell ACE and AT1-R gene activa-
tion and resulted in a higher intracellular Ang II concentra-
tion and in the almost complete release of T-cell ACE
activity in the supernatant. These findings strongly suggest
that in vivo in unstable angina patients T-cell RAS could
increase the local Ang II concentration inside plaques or in
microvessels of left ventricular myocardium where they
migrate. T cells are involved in the process of endothelial
dysfunction contributing to plaque destabilisation10 and the

increased production ofAng II by T cells could play a major
role in inducing endothelial damage. In a previous study we
demonstrated that the cardiac RAS acts locally and sustains
generalised inflammation in the smaller coronary vessels of
patients with unstable angina11 by the novo production of
Ang II; in unstable angina patients the heart can contribute
Ang II to the circulation and play a role in maintaining sys-
temic inflammation of unstable angina. The demonstration
of the upregulation of circulating T-cell RAS in unstable
angina patients shows that T cells are actively involved in
the microvessel inflammation and can further amplify the
systemic and cardiac activation of the immune system, also
by the cell-based synthesis of Ang II. In agreement with our
data, previous research indicated that inflammation and
immune cell infiltration are associated with cardiovascular
diseases and play a major role in the development of athero-
sclerosis.12,13 Clinical trials have shown that early adminis-
tered ACE inhibition improves prognosis in patients with
myocardial infarction and unstable angina14 and indirectly
suggests a role of RAS in ACS. The Heart Outcomes
Prevention Evaluation study showed that an ACE inhibitor
reduced cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction15 and
the need for revascularisation after stenting, and reduced
subsequent events in patients with angina pectoris.16 In
patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarc-
tion, enalapril and ilbesartan treatment started at admission
or at discharge was associated with a decrease in the levels
of markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and
ischaemia at 60 days.As a whole, these findings support that
RAS activation is involved in the inflammatory stress asso-
ciated with atherosclerotic damage of coronary vessels.Ang
II is one of the most potent mitogens that induce monocytes
entering into vessel walls to cause inflammatory response in
vascular smooth muscle cells,17 and might be associated
with the development of atherosclerosis via regulating spe-
cific T-cell phenotypes.18
In the past few years, a lymphocytic-based RAS was
shown in humans that operates as an autonomous source of
Ang II, independent of circulating and tissue RAS.19­21
According to these findings, lymphocytes are endowed not
only with ACE activity, as first reported,20 but also with all
RAS genes necessary for Ang II synthesis and can autono-
mously modulate the intracellular Ang II concentration.
Under physiological conditions, Ang II upregulates lym-
phocytic RAS throughAT1-Rs.6 In our previous paper about
hypertensive patients with low grade inflammation, the
T-cell RAS response to Ang II is amplified in comparison
with T cells from controls and hypertensive patients with
hs-CRP less than 2mg/dl, suggesting that T-cell RAS activ-
ity is strictly related to inflammatory lymphocyte activa-
tion.21 In T cells from hypertensive patients with low grade
inflammation, no activation of T-cell RAS was found under
baseline conditions withoutAng II stimulus. Remarkably, in
T cells from unstable angina patients with high hs-CRP lev-
els, T-cell RAS was activated also under baseline conditions
independently of Ang II stimulus. The amount of Ang II
synthesised by unstable angina T cells could not modify
Ang II concentration in plasma, as shown by normal PRA
and Ang I and II levels found in this and previous work,22
but they could affect the local Ang II concentration in tis-
sues where they migrate. In vitro we showed that Ang II
stimulation caused the almost complete release of ACE
activity by T cells in supernatant; this finding strongly sup-
ports the concept that the upregulation of unstable angina T
cells is aimed at increasing extra (plaques and coronary
microvessels) more than intra T-cell Ang II concentrations.
The in vitro marked release of ACE enzymatic activity
into the supernatant by cultured T cells from unstable
angina patients could translate in vivo into the local activa-
tion of other cells endowed with AT1-R, such as endothe-
lial cells and monocytes localised inside coronary plaques
or coronary microvessels.23

A role for inflammatory mediators during the evolution
of ACS is indicated by the widespread coronary inflamma-
tion found during unstable angina, throughout the entire
coronary artery bed, and not only in the artery containing
the culprit lesion shown by us and by other groups.3,4 The
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying a worse evo-
lution of ACS patients with systemic inflammation are still
under debate. Our findings show that in unstable angina
the activation of T cells is associated with the selective
upregulation of T-cell RAS. Unstable angina T cells can be
the key step between inflammation and RAS activation
that can reciprocally potentiate according to a positive
feedback loop.
According to our findings the role of culprit lesion
played by unstable plaques could be mediated by the
increased Ang II production by activated circulating T
cells migrated inside those plaques.24,25
Study limitations
ACE and Ang II can induce or suppress specific classes of
T cells. In an experimental model proinflammatory T
helper (Th)1 and Th17 cell induction was associated with
increased Ang II in both CD4 T cells and monocytes.
Different T-cell populations are known to operate with
opposite roles on the immune system; we did not make
distinctions betweenT-cell subtypes so we cannot specify
to what T-cell subpopulation Ang II upregulation was
linked. However, in experimental models 8 weeks of
exogenous Ang II treatment accelerated the development
of atherosclerosis and prompted a switch from a stable to
unstable plaque that was associated with a change in
CD4+ T-lymphocyte activity; valsartan inhibited the
effect of Ang II and significantly increased the frequency
of Th2 and Treg cells.26 In different atherosclerotic-prone
models the proatherogenic properties of Th1 were shown
and evidence from clinical investigations was collected
that the upregulation of the Th1 immune response was
overwhelming in patients with ACS,27,28 and that an Ang
II-due imbalance between Th1 and Th2 response might
play a role in plaque rupture.29,30 Recently, in healthy sub-
jects, cultured Th1 and Th17 cells, as well as related
cytokines including IFN-, were notably increased by the
addition of Ang II in a dose-dependent manner, and the
promoted effects were significantly inhibited after treat-
ment with Ang II antagonists.18 As a whole, these findings
strongly suggest that the activation of T-cell RAS found in
angina patients is part of the dysregulation in T-cell popu-
lation underlying ACS.
Conclusions
Our findings strongly suggest that the activation of T-cell
RAS found in unstable angina and not stable angina
patients is part of the dysregulation in T-cell population
function underlying ACS. T-cell RAS could play a major
role in the promotion of the widespread coronary inflam-
mation and plaque destabilisation in UA patients.
