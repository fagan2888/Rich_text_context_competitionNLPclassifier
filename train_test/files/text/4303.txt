Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the combined diagnostic value of two serum osteoarthritis (OA)
markers and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of the cartilage volume
of the tibial plateau in a canine model of experimental OA.
Methods: A total of 18 male Beagle dogs were used in this longitudinal study. OA was surgically
induced via anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) of the right knee in 10 dogs. The
remaining eight dogs formed the sham operation control group and underwent the same pro-
cedure without ACLT. At various times after surgery, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was
used to measure serum C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) and type X collagen (ColX)
levels. Quantitative evaluation of the tibial plateau volume was undertaken using MRI and ImageJ
software.
Results: The serum CTX-II levels were significantly higher in the OA group at weeks 8, 12 and
16 after surgery, but not at week 4, compared with the control group. The serum ColX levels in
the OA group were significantly higher than in the control group at weeks 8 and 12. The tibial
plateau cartilage volumes in the OA group were significantly lower than in the control group at
weeks 8 and 16.

Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenera-
tive joint disease involving the hip, knee,
spine, and other weight-bearing joints. It
seriously affects the activities of daily
living and often leads to disability.1 At pre-
sent, joint replacement is the most effective
treatment for OA; no other method is effec-
tive to improve subchondral bone and car-
tilage structure.2 The majority of treatments
are symptomatic, being designed to relieve
pain, but they do not stop or delay disease
progression, so ultimately, many patients
require artificial joint replacement surgery.
Therefore, early diagnosis of OA and accu-
rate prediction of disease development is
extremely important.
With the rapid development of molecu-
lar biology, considerable research has been
undertaken in the evaluation of biochemical
markers for the early diagnosis of knee OA
and disease prediction. To date, markers of
cartilage metabolism, C-telopeptide of type
II collagen (CTX-II)3­5 and type X collagen
(ColX),6 have been identified. These
markers are important for medical and
pharmaceutical research. CTX-II is a spe-
cific degradation product of cartilage colla-
gen type II catabolism that can be released
into the blood.7Research has found that
patients with hip OA exhibit significantly
increased urine CTX-II levels than do
healthy individuals; and patients with
rapid OA progression presented with urine
CTX-II levels that were significantly higher
than those of patients with slow progres-
sion.8 In addition, CTX-II was associated
with radiographic OA progression in dis-
eased knee and hip joints.9,10 The specific
expression of ColX in OA has attracted
considerable attention from researchers in
this field as another potential serum bio-
marker for cartilage degradation.6 ColX,
a non-fibrillar collagen consisting of three
identical alpha 1 chains transcribed from
the COL10A1 gene, is a well-established
marker for hypertrophic chondrocyte dif-
ferentiation.11 Research has demonstrated
that ColX mRNA and protein levels are
significantly increased in patients with
OA.12 ColX is also a specific marker of
hypertrophic chondrocytes in OA.13­15
This evidence supports the theory that
ColX might have potential as a specific
diagnostic biochemical marker for OA.11­16
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
being increasingly used for the accurate
evaluation of articular cartilage injury.
Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of
knee OA have confirmed notable sensitivity
and accuracy when using quantitative MRI
analysis of structural joint changes.17,18
Long-term structural changes and associat-
ed morphological changes in knee OA can
be accurately assessed via an OA model
through quantitative analysis using MRI
software.
This current longitudinal study aimed to
evaluate the combined diagnostic value of

markers (CTX-II and ColX) and the quan-
titative evaluation of tibial plateau cartilage
volume using MRI software in an anterior
cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)
animal model of OA.
Materials and methods
Animal model induction
This longitudinal animal study was con-
ducted in the Department of Joint
Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of
Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi,
China and it was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Xinjiang Medical University
(no. 20150507-05). It was undertaken in
strict accordance with the regulations out-
lined by the Animal Protection Committee.
All procedures complied with the guidelines
of the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care,
and the protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital
of Xinjiang Medical University (protocol
no. IACUC20160616-08).
A total of 18 male Beagle dogs, aged
2.0­2.5 years and weighing 15­18 kg, were
used in the study. The dogs were weighed
and organised into increasing weight order
from 1 to 18. They were then randomly
assigned to either the experimental
(n ¼ 10) or control group (n ¼ 8) using a
random number table. The animals were
housed in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle
with free access to water and food. In the
experimental group, the 10 randomly
assigned dogs underwent ACLT of the
right knee joint under general anaesthesia
following induction of anaesthesia using
an intramuscular injection of ZoletilV
R 50
(0.5 ml/kg) mixed with Su-Mian-Xin
(0.5 ml/kg) as described in brief here.
As dogs have spontaneous breathing,
there was no need for mechanical ventila-
tion during surgery. Intravenous antibiotics
were administered to prevent infection.
Along the medial patella skin incision, the
subcutaneous tissue was opened, and the
capsule and fat pad were fully exposed in
order to cut the anterior cruciate ligament
(ACL) (Figure 1). Close attention was paid
to ensure no damage was caused to the sur-
rounding tissue when the ACL was cut.
A medial lateral stress test and drawer test
were performed and the success of the
ACLT was confirmed by a positive result.
The articular capsule, subcutaneous tissue
and the skin were sutured layer-by-layer,
paying attention to haemostasis. A further

eight male Beagle dogs formed the control
group and received sham surgery. Sham
surgery involved opening the knee joint
capsule, fully exposing the ACL without
any treatment, and closing the joint capsule
before suturing the subcutaneous tissue and
the skin. Oxygen saturation, blood pres-
sure, and heart rate were continuously
monitored during surgery. Postoperative
follow-up was performed to determine
whether infection or gastrointestinal com-
plications occurred. Following surgery, the
two groups of dogs underwent the same
forced twice daily walk (1 h each time) for
16 weeks.
Biochemical marker measurements
At different time-points after surgery,
venous blood samples (approximately 5
ml) were collected from the necks of all
dogs. The blood samples were labelled, set
aside for 1 h, and then centrifuged at room
temperature (1000 g, 10 min) using a Sigma
1-15K centrifuge (Sigma Laborzentrifugen
GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany)
prior to the storage of serum at ­80°C.
Serum levels of CTX-II and ColX were
determined using enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) kits following the
manufacturer's instructions (Canine CTX-
II ELISA Kit and Canine COL-X ELISA
Kit; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA). In brief, the microplates provided
by these kits were precoated with anti-
canine CTX-II- and ColX-specific antibod-
ies. Using a purified polyclonal antibody to
the coat the microtiter plate wells, a solid-
phase antibody was used, then the biochem-
ical marker was added to the wells and
combined with a horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-labelled polyclonal antibody. This
formed an antibody-antigen-enzyme-
antibody complex that, after washing
completely, was supplemented with
3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine substrate
solution that became blue as the HRP
enzyme catalysed the reaction. The reaction
was terminated by the addition of a sulphu-
ric acid solution and the colour change was
measured spectrophotometrically at a
wavelength of 450 nm using a full wave-
length Benchmark Plus microplate reader
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The con-
centration of the two biochemical markers
in the serum samples was determined by
comparing the optical density of the sam-
ples to the standard curve. The minimum
detectable concentrations were 6ng/ml for
CTX-II and 0.1 pg/ml for ColX. Intra-
and interassay coefficients of variation
for all ELISAs were<9% and <11%,
respectively.
MRI protocol and image processing
High resolution MRI using a wrist coil and
a Siemens 1.5 T scanner (MAGNETOMV
R
Avanto 1.5T; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany)
was undertaken preoperatively and at post-
operative weeks 4, 8 and 16 to examine the
right knee joints. After checking the stan-
dard equipment used, the dog was placed in
the supine position, the right leg was
stretched and fixed, and the knee joint was
placed in the wrist circle for scanning. In
addition, a cushion was used to assist the
dog in maintaining the supine position and
the right hind leg in a slightly internal rota-
tion hold. MRI was undertaken under gen-
eral anaesthesia using ZoletilV
R 50 (0.5 ml/
kg) mixed with Su-Mian-Xin (0.5 ml/kg).
As dogs have spontaneous breathing,
there was no need for mechanical ventila-
tion during the MRI. The dogs were mon-
itored under the supervision of a
veterinarian.
The MRI examination of the right knee
joint included two image acquisition
sequences. The left knee was not checked.
A sagittal 3-dimensional volume interpola-
tion T1-weighted (t1-vibe-we-sag) MRI
with fat saturation (TR, 14.8ms; TE, 6.5
ms; flip angle, 10 u; slice thickness, 1mm)
2026 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
was used for cartilage analysis (cartilage
volume and defects). A coronal fast spin
echo T2-weighted (t2-tse-cor) with fat satu-
ration (TR, 2000 ms; TE,36 ms; slice thick-
ness, 2 mm; flip angle, 180 u) was
utilized for the subchondral bone lesions.
The total acquisition time was approxi-
mately 60 min.
Evaluation was performed in a blinded
fashion by two physicians experienced
with musculoskeletal system MRI. The
final diagnosis was made by a consensus
following evaluation of the changes of the
articular cartilage and subchondral bone
structure of the knee joint between the
operation and sham-operation groups.
The presence and location of bone
marrow oedema and cartilage of tibial pla-
teau alterations were used as the indicators
for MRI evaluation. The cartilage volume
of the lateral and medial tibia was assessed
by quantitative measurement, which was
performed using the 3-dimensional
FLASH images and ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health) as previous-
ly described.19,20 The volume of the tibial
plateau cartilage was measured using
ImageJ at different time-points after sur-
gery. The absolute volumes at each time-
point were compared with those obtained
prior to surgery (baseline) and expressed
as a percentage difference (%).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSV
R statistical package, version
22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsV
R . Quantitative data are expressed
as mean Æ SD. Serum CTX-II and ColX
levels and MRI tibial plateau cartilage vol-
umes in the OA group were compared with
those of the control group using an inde-
pendent sample t-test (2-detailed, 95% con-
fidence interval). Using Shapiro­Wilk for
normality testing, P > 0.1 was considered
to indicate that the data were normally
distributed. A P 0.05was considered sta-
tistically significant.
Results
Changes in the levels of the two serum bio-
markers at multiple time-points after sur-
gery are shown in Figures 2 and 3. ColX
levels peaked at week 8 in the group with
OA, after which the levels decreased.
The difference between the two groups
was significant at weeks 8 and 12
(P ¼ 0.005 and P ¼ 0.018, respectively).
The highest serum CTX-II level was
observed at week 12 in the group with
OA, after which the levels decreased, but
remained significantly higher than the con-
trol group (P 0.05). The difference
between the two groups was significant at
weeks 8, 12 and 16 (P ¼ 0.012, P ¼ 0.001,
and P ¼ 0.002 respectively).
Over the course of 16 weeks post-
surgery, there was a progressive loss of car-
tilage volume on the tibial plateaus in the
group with OA (Figure 4; Table 1). These
changes were first detected at week 8 post-

surgery and became more apparent over
time. The difference between the two
groups was significant at weeks 8 and 16
(P < 0.001 for both comparisons).
According to the gross morphology
(Figure 5), the cartilage lesion that
increased over time predominantly
occurred on the central and posterior por-
tion of the tibial plateaus, which included
the weight-bearing areas.
The changes in subchondral bone
marrow oedema over time are illustrated
in Figure 6. At week 4, MRI revealed sub-
chondral bone marrow oedema in the post-
eromedial tibia in three dogs (OA group),
causing a hyperintense signal on the t2-tse-
cor sequences. No bone marrow oedema
was detected in the sham-operated knees.
Discussion
Articular cartilage degeneration is the pri-
mary concern in patients with OA, as the
homeostasis and integrity of the articular
cartilage rely on its biochemical and
biomechanical interplay with the subchon-
dral bone and other joint tissues.21
Subchondral bone provides the mechanical
support for the overlying articular cartilage
during the movement of load-bearing
joints, and undergoes constant adaptation
in response to changes in the mechanical
environment through modelling or remod-
elling.22 As a result of the instability of
mechanical loading on such joints, the sub-
chondral bone and calcified cartilage zone
undergo changes.23During the progression
of OA in its early stage, the abnormal pro-
liferation of subchondral bone and the
overlying articular cartilage are subjected
to the combined effects of abnormal
mechanical pressure, biochemical and
other complex factors leading to the occur-
rence of hypertrophic degeneration of chon-
drocytes.21 Hypertrophic degeneration of
chondrocytes results in the secretion of
large amounts of ColX when attempting
to repair damaged chondrocytes.24

The critical role of hypertrophic chondro-
cytes has been summarized in several nota-
ble reviews.25,26 Due to patients with OA
continuously suffering from abnormal pro-
liferation of subchondral bone and the
comprehensive effect of complex abnormal
biochemical factors, this may finally lead to
the death of the chondrocyte and result in
further degradation of articular cartilage.23
Type II collagen is localized almost exclu-
sively in cartilage, where it is a major struc-
tural component of the tissue.7With the
deterioration of OA, type II collagen
degradation increased in the cartilage, and
CTX-II is the specific degradation fragment
of type II collagen that is released into the
blood.27 Therefore, the combined detection
of hypertrophic chondrocyte specific
markers, ColX and type II collagen degra-
dation marker CTX-II, as joint cartilage
metabolism markers has a solid theoretical
basis.6
Type X collagen is a well-established
marker for hypertrophic chondrocyte dif-
ferentiation, which is a non-fibrillar colla-
gen consisting of three identical alpha 1

chains.28 Each chain has three domains: a
short triple helix domain flanked by a
bigger globular domain (NC1 domain) at
the carboxyl end and a short non-
collagenous domain (NC2 domain) at the
amino end. ColX is thought to be specifi-
cally synthesized by hypertrophic chondro-
cytes of the growth plate during the
development of long bones.23 Normal
chondrocytes do not secrete ColX, but
articular chondrocytes undergoing abnor-
mal hypertrophic degeneration secrete
large amounts of ColX.24 A previous
study found that anti-ColX monoclonal
antibody was produced by using the specific
peptide (SFSGFLVAPM), the truncated
peptide (SFSGFLVA) without the last two
amino acids and the nonsense peptide
(DMDYLPRVPNQ), and through the
detection of serum ColX levels in 261
cases of knee OA patients and 10 normal
subjects, it was found that the serum levels
of ColX in the knee OA group were signif-
icantly increased.6 This present study found
that the levels of serum ColX in the dogs
with the ACLT model of OA were signifi-
cantly higher than those of the sham oper-
ation control group at weeks 8 and 12. At
week 16, the levels of serum ColX in the OA
group were increased slightly compared
with the control group, but the difference
was not significant. These current findings
suggest that in the OA group at week 4, the
early stages of hypertrophic degeneration of
the chondrocytes resulted in the secretion of
ColX in an attempt to repair damaged
chondrocytes, leading to a gradual increase
in the secretion of ColX into the serum. By
weeks 8 and 12, a large number of chondro-
cytes exhibited hypertrophic degeneration
and ColX secretion markedly increased.
At week 8, detection of ColX in the circu-
latory system was significantly increased
and reached its peak. At week 16, as a
result of the persistent effect of the mechan-
ical instability of the articular cartilage, the
number of chondrocytes that died due to
the hypertrophy and degeneration gradual-
ly increased. Similarly, the volume of artic-
ular cartilage gradually reduced, leading to

subchondral bone exposure and joint space
narrowing. Cartilage loss is a serious health
risk, thus the secretion of ColX began to
decline, and the level of ColX in the periph-
eral blood also decreased. Therefore, these
current findings support the use of ColX as
a potential marker of OA disease
progression.
C-telopeptide of type II collagen is a
micro-molecule polypeptide produced by
the cleavage of type II collagen by activated
protease, which finally accumulates in the
urine via the circulatory system.29,30 With
the aggravation of articular cartilage
injury, serum CTX-II levels may be
increased.31­34 Therefore, CTX-II is well-
suited as a quantitative biomarker of OA
cartilage degeneration and is a sensitive
method for the detection of type II collagen
degradation in patients with OA.35 A pre-
vious study investigated the changes of
serum CTX-II levels in OA induced by
ACLT for up to 5 months.3 The study
found that the CTX-II concentration first
peaked at 3 weeks post-surgery; but from
the sixth week, a second peak in CTX-II
concentration was noted during week 12
after surgery, which was then followed by
a decline until the end of the study.3As a
result, the authors concluded that OA
began to deteriorate from the sixth week
post-surgery.3 Moreover, the peak value of
CTX-II concentration may be significantly
correlated with the aggravation of articular
cartilage lesions.3 Another study found that
the CTX-II concentration in the synovial
fluid of patients with knee joint injury is
increased.30 Other researchers have also
reported a transient increase in CTX-II
levels in the rabbit model of OA.36,37 In a
canine OA model, serum CTX-II levels
were significantly higher than those of the
control group.38 The current investigation
demonstrated that serum CTX-II levels
were higher in the OA group compared
with the control group at week 4 but the
difference was not significant. At weeks 8,
12 and 16, serum CTX-II levels in the OA
group were significantly higher than those
of the control group. These findings suggest
that, in the early stages of cartilage injury,
type II collagen undergoes no obvious deg-
radation. In the early stages of articular car-
tilage damage, compensatory hypertrophy
of the chondrocytes occurs in an attempt
to repair the damage, but with the increas-
ing severity of OA, hyperplastic chondro-
cytes from the early stage undergo cell
death and necrosis. As the chrondrocytes
continue to die, there is also the continuous
degradation of type II collagen, so that
increasing amounts of CTX-II are released
into the blood leading to an increase in
CTX-II levels between weeks 8 and 16.
Therefore, CTX-II has potential as a bio-
chemical marker of cartilage type II colla-
gen degradation for monitoring the
progression of OA.
In recent years, with the improvements
in the spatial resolution of MRI technology,
the software that can quantitatively evalu-
ate MRI cartilage volume has increased in
accuracy. ImageJ software is a Java-based
public image processing and analysis pro-
gram developed by Professor Wayne
Rasband at the National Institutes of
Health. It supports image stacks, a series
of images that share a single window in
image processing, and is multithreaded.
This present study used lmageJ software
to measure the cartilage volume of the
tibial plateau of the knee joint in a canine
MRI T1-vibe sequence. The results showed
that in the control sham operation group,
the cartilage volume of the tibial plateau
was similar before and after the sham sur-
gery. In the OA group at week 4, the carti-
lage volume of the tibial plateau increased
by 1.4%compared with the preoperative
baseline values, although there was no sig-
nificant difference between the two groups.
At weeks 8 and 16, the cartilage volume of
the tibial plateau in the OA group
decreased by 8.8% and 22.8%, respectively,
Ren et al. 2031
compared with the preoperative baseline
values; and the difference between the two
groups was significant. We hypothesize
that, at week 4, in the early stages of carti-
lage injury, ACLT leads to mechanical
instability of the knee joint and injury to
the articular cartilage surface.
Simultaneously, the articular chondrocytes
undergo compensatory hypertrophy when
trying to repair the damaged chondrocytes.
Therefore, the volume of the tibial plateau
cartilage was slightly increased compared
with the preoperative values. However, as
time goes on, with the death of articular
chondrocytes from compensatory hypertro-
phy due to decompensation gradually
increasing, the thickness of the articular
cartilage gradually reduced. Therefore, at
weeks 8 and 16, the volume of the tibial
plateau was significantly decreased com-
pared with the preoperative baseline
values. However, at week 4, the differences
were not significant when compared with
preoperative baseline values. The restricted
sample size may be a limitation of the pre-
sent study, so these conclusions require fur-
ther investigation.
Although the ACLT model has been fre-
quently used in the past, there are fewer
studies on the pathological mechanism of
cartilage damage in OA from the viewpoint
of serology and imaging. This present
study, from the serological point of view,
explores the compensatory hypertrophic
degeneration of chondrocytes after injury,
which attempts to repair damaged chondro-
cytes. However, the continuous mechanical
instability acting on the articular cartilage
alters the mechanism from compensatory
hypertrophy to decompensated death and
subsequently leads to the degeneration of
articular cartilage.39 The current quantita-
tive MRI analysis of the tibial plateau car-
tilage volume also found that the cartilage
volume increased lightly during the early
stage of injury because of the compensatory
hypertrophy of chondrocytes. However,
under the continuous pressure of mechani-
cal instability, the death of cartilage cells
gradually increased, eventually resulting in
a markedly decreased articular cartilage
volume compared with the preoperative
values (baseline). The changes in articular
cartilage volume were also consistent with
the serological test results. It should be
noted that a potential limitation of this
study is the fact that subchondral bone
marrow oedema is not a common occur-
rence detected using MRI in Beagles.
Among the dogs that exhibited bone
marrow oedema in the current study, the
oedema was not increased with the degen-
eration of the cartilage. Some dogs exhib-
ited obvious oedema after week 4 in the
medial tibial plateau. Although the
oedema was reduced by postoperative
week 8, the oedema markedly increased
again after week 16. One dog presented
with oedema at postoperative week 4 and
the oedema was resolved at the week 8 and
16 scans, with no obvious presentation
during follow-up. A previous study found
that the degeneration of articular cartilage
is closely related to bone marrow injury.40
However, the present study found that
there was no universal prevalence of sub-
chondral bone marrow oedema in this
canine model of cartilage degeneration
OA. Furthermore, in the small number of
dogs that exhibited oedema, the oedema did
not gradually increase with the deteriora-
tion of OA disease. Therefore, the present
study did not demonstrate an obvious syn-
ergistic relationship between bone marrow
oedema and OA cartilage degeneration.
Additional research is required to investi-
gate the latter stages of OA in terms of
bone marrow oedema.
In conclusion, these current results indi-
cate that combined serum marker changes
and quantitative MRI evaluation of the car-
tilage volume of the tibial plateau in a
canine model of experimental OA may
potentially be used to detect and monitor

the progression of OA. Moreover, the
results of this study suggest a novel direc-
tion for follow-up analysis of the biochem-
ical pathogenesis of OA cartilage
degeneration.
