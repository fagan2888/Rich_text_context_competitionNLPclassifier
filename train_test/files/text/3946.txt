Abstract: Pilot data from eye-tracking research suggest that each male participant has his
own gaze pattern, usefully regarded as an individual difference, when viewing female
targets whom they are rating for attractiveness. Gaze patterns appear to be consistent within
a given male participant across a variety of target models, and these individual differences
may override characteristics of the model in determining fixation points, body region focus,
and other eye-tracker variables. The goal of the present study was to elucidate these
variations of gaze pattern by assessing the extent to which systematic "types" of gaze
patterns exist among a group of male participants. Latent class analysis was used to place
60 men into groups based on their gaze pattern. A two-cluster solution produced the most
interpretable analysis, and groups formed by this clustering were significantly different
from each other on variables of interest. Cross validation of this solution across three
additional female models resulted in some support for generalization, though exceptions
were noted.
Keywords: eye tracking, attractiveness appraisal, gaze patterns

Introduction
Evolutionary psychology offers many predictions about determinants of sexual
attractiveness for both men and women. Classically, men attend most to cues associated
with fertility, whereas women, to a much greater degree than men, attend to cues associated
with resource accrual (Buss, 1994). Much behavioral data exist to provide support for these
hypotheses. In a previous study (Melnyk and McCord, 2012) the authors examined hair
color as a potential determinant of male judgments of female attractiveness, using eye-
tracker technology to assess male gaze patterns. An unexpected finding was that men
tended to differ notably from each other with regard to gaze pattern, although each

individual male participant tended to utilize the same gaze pattern across different female
images. The present study was designed to investigate this serendipitous finding.
Although a full review of the mate attraction literature is beyond the scope of the
current paper, key findings are relevant. Thornhill and Grammer (1999) credit
Westermarck (1921) with first linking attractiveness determinants to evolutionary
functionality. He proposed that judgments of sexual attraction are species typical and
evolved by natural selection, as attractiveness gives visual cues to health and reproductive
fitness. The same suggestion was proposed by Ellis (1926), focusing on the evolutionary
function of the perception of attractiveness. Symons (1979) also stressed the association of
health and fertility with cues that we find attractive. Symons documented that, as predicted
by sexual selection theory, men pay more attention to physical attractiveness than do
women. Buss's (1994) large cross-cultural studies of 37 countries assessing the importance
placed on the attractiveness of a partner is a landmark in this literature. In all cases men
placed more value on physical appearance in a potential mate than women did.
Two broad features that span much of this literature are youth and beauty. Both
function as core aspects of female attractiveness, and both have been clearly linked to
numerous biological markers of health, fertility, and reproductive value. Cross-cultural
studies show that, to a near-universal degree, men prefer women who are younger than
themselves (e.g., Buss, 1994; Symons, 1995). A more precise evolutionary prediction is
that men prefer not just younger women, but women closer to the age of maximum fertility,
the early to mid-20's. Kenrick, Keefe, Gabrielidis, and Cornelius (1996) explored this
concept by gathering data from teenagers. Their data show that adolescent males actually
preferred females in their 20s, who in some cases were up to seven years older than the
male participant.
With regard to beauty, many variables have been examined, including body size and
shape, facial femininity and symmetry, skin tone and clarity, and length and quality of hair.
As noted above, a full review of all research in this very active field is beyond the scope of
this introduction, but key findings in areas most relevant to the current project will be
summarized below.
Devendra Singh has contributed significantly to the evolutionary psychology
literature with a series of studies on women's waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (Singh, 1993;
Singh and Randall, 2007; Singh and Young, 1995). Reproductively healthy women have a
WHR between .67 and .80 (whereas healthy men have ratio in the range of .85 - .95).
Diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart-attack, stroke, and gallbladder disorders have
been shown to have a link to fat distribution in regards to the WHR, more so than the actual
amount of fat, which may help to explain the signal value of this particular index. In
addition to indicating possible health problems, WHR has also been empirically linked to
fertility factors. In one study, researchers found that women with a low WHR (indicated by
a small waist) and relatively large breasts had 26 percent higher levels of estradiol, an
ovarian hormone that is a good predictor of fertility (Jasienska, Ziomkiewicz, Ellison,
Lipson, and Thune, 2004). In another fascinating study, even blind men were able to
demonstrate a preference for lower WHR by feeling mannequins (Karremans, Frankenhuis,
and Arons, 2010). Across studies, men rated women with an average WHR of .70 as more
attractive than either smaller or larger values.

In recent years researchers have begun to question the specificity of WHR as an
indicator of attractiveness. A number of studies suggest Body Mass Index (BMI) may be a
greater predictor of attractiveness than WHR. Results have shown that WHR and BMI are
positively correlated, as WHR goes up so does BMI; however, when statistically
controlling for BMI, WHR was not a significant determinant of attractiveness (Cornelissen,
Tovee, and Bateson, 2009). These results suggest WHR is only important because it gives
information about BMI. Similar results were found in an eye-tracking study that found gaze
patterns fixated on the waist and breasts, but not on hips or pelvis (Cornelissen, Hancock, et
al., 2009). Rilling et al. (2009) found that both BMI and WHR were significant predictors
of attractiveness; however, waist circumference was an even greater predictor. There is still
much research needed to distinguish which of these factors plays the bigger role or what
other variables may be relevant.
Skin quality is another important factor as it not only gives an indication towards
current health, but also acts as a part time record of previous health. (Sugiyama, 2005).
Skin quality has been linked to facial attractiveness (Fink and Neave, 2005). Homogeneous
skin is seen as younger and more attractive than splotchy skin (Fink, Grammer, and Matts,
2006; Fink et al., 2008). Clear and unblemished skin shows the absence of parasites, skin
damaging diseases, and possibly good genes to heal without infection (Singh and Bronstad,
1997). Faces figure prominently in attractiveness research. A more feminine face is seen as
more attractive, defined by features including full lips, relatively larger eyes, thinner jaws,
small chin, high cheekbones, and a relatively short distance between mouth and jaw
(Gangestad and Scheyd, 2005). Feminine faces are likely to be an attractiveness
determinant for two reasons. First, as women age their facial features tend to become less
feminine; thus, facial femininity offers cues regarding youth. Second, facial femininity is
also linked to higher levels of estrogen, the ovarian hormone linked to fertility (Schaefer et
al., 2006). Meta-analysis reveals that facial femininity is one of the most powerful cues to a
woman's attractiveness (Rhodes, 2006). Other cues offered by the face involve symmetry,
hypothesized as an indicator of developmental stability, a signal of "good genes" and the
capacity to withstand environmental challenges. Symmetrical faces have been positively
correlated with judgments of attractiveness compared to non-symmetrical faces (Fink,
Neave, Manning, and Grammer, 2006).
Not all researchers agree on the importance of facial symmetry. Derek Hodgson
(2009) suggests that an attraction to symmetry is not a sexually driven desire, but a
perceptual bias. He argues that while symmetrical faces are perceived as attractive, they are
not reliable cues to an individual's actual quality of health.
The length and quality of hair is yet another cue that can be read when assessing a
woman's attractiveness. A study was conducted interviewing 230 women at various public
locations about their age, subjective health, and relationship status. Researchers also
collected measures for hair length, and hair quality (Hinsz, Matz, and Patience, 2001). Hair
length and quality were strong cues to youth. Younger women tend to have longer hair than
older women; furthermore, observers' judgments of the quality of women's hair were also
positively correlated with women's subjective judgments of their own health. Fink, Neuser,
Deloux, Roeder, and Matts (2013) found that healthy hair was rated as younger, healthier,
and more attractive than damaged hair. Hair can also significantly increase or alter female

facial attractiveness.
With the increasingly widespread availability of eye-tracker technology, these
evolutionary predictions may be tested in more precise ways and at a deeper level. Whereas
eye-tracking has existed in some form for more than 100 years, only within the past decade
has this technology been applied to evolutionary psychology and the study of determinants
of attractiveness.
Recent research has indicated that both men and women have a higher number of
fixations and longer viewing times when viewing erotic versus non-erotic stimuli (Lykins,
Meana, and Strauss, 2008). Similarly, heterosexual males pay more attention to adult
females than to adult males or to children of either sex (Fromberger et al., 2011). Hall,
Hogue, and Guo (2011) had male participants view pictures of women ranging in age from
birth to 60. Men exhibited more fixations and longer overall gaze time when viewing 20-
year-old women as compared to any other age group, consistent with evolutionary
predictions regarding peak fertility.
A number of recent studies have used eye-tracking to explore more specific
determinants of attractiveness. Hewig, Trippe, Hecht, Straube, and Miltner (2008) reported
that both male and female observers gazed primarily at people's faces. After initial scan of
the face, men then gazed longer at women's breasts, whereas women gazed at men's legs.
Similar results had been reported early by researchers using sexually explicit stimuli (Rupp
and Wallen, 2007).
As noted above, female WHR has been associated frequently with attractiveness
ratings. Dixson, Grimshaw, Linklater, and Dixson (2011) used eye-tracker technology to
explore this common finding. Men viewed frontal view images of the same woman,
computer-morphed to vary her WHR (.7 or .9) and breast size (small, medium, large). Both
breasts and hips received more first-fixations than any other body region. Men gazed longer
at breasts than at any other region, but, consistent with prevailing literature, they rated the
.7 WHR as most attractive, independent of breast size. Cornelissen, Hancock et al. (2009)
conducted an eye-tracker study to address the distinction between WHR and overall body
fat (BMI) in attractiveness judgments. They used three different groups of raters: the first
was asked to judge attractiveness, the second to judge WHR, and the third to judge BMI.
The fixation patterns for the attractiveness group were very similar to those of the BMI
group, and different from the WHR group. This finding adds to a growing literature that
suggests BMI, rather than WHR per se, is the key issue in rating female attractiveness. The
Cornelissen, Hancock et al. study also serves as a clear example of how eye-tracker
technology can help to test competing hypotheses in evolutionary psychology.
In a previous study (Melnyk and McCord, 2012), the current authors explored the
hypothesis that blonde hair was a signal of youth, predicting that heterosexual male
participants would gaze at hair earlier, and for a higher proportion of total time, with
blonde models, compared to brown-haired, black-haired, or red-haired models. However,
no differences in predicted eye-tracking variables were found. Observation of participants
during the session, confirmed by subsequent data analysis, indicated that a high level of
individual variation occurred on each of the eye-tracker metrics. Statistically, then, the
within-group variance overshadowed any mean differences between models that might
have been found. The present study was designed to follow up on this unexpected finding.

Specifically, we re-examined our data with regard to the possibility that "types" of gaze
patterns might exist in a group of male participants. Our informal observation was that each
participant appeared to exhibit a consistent strategy of gaze across models, regardless of
experimental condition. We wondered if there might be systematic patterns shared by
clusters of men.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Sixty male participants were recruited for this study from the Department of
Psychology human subject pool at a regional comprehensive state university in the rural
Southeast. All were of traditional college age (M = 19.03, SD = 2.73, min = 17, max = 36)
and 80% indicated their ethnicity as White (11.67% African American, 5% Multiracial,
1.67% Native American, 1.67% Asian). The last item on the brief demographics
questionnaire asked if the participant was romantically attracted to women; this was
intended as an exclusion criterion, but no participants answered negatively.
Materials and apparatus
The study was conducted using a Tobii TX 300 Eye Tracker to measure various
aspects of eye movement (300 Hz gaze capture frequency). The eye-tracking device looks
very similar to a large computer display screen, and therefore the eye-tracking hardware is
not readily apparent to participants. The device captures eye position remotely with
cameras embedded in a module below the display screen, which is used to present
experimental stimuli (23 inch diagonal, 1920x1080 resolution widescreen LCD). Viewing
distance for the device was 66 cm. We used a velocity-threshold fixation identification
algorithm provided with the Tobii Studio software to classify eye gaze points as either
belonging to a fixation or a saccade (Komogortsev, Gobert, Jayarathna, Koh, and Gowda,
2010; Salvucci and Goldberg, 2000). In our application of the algorithm, gaze samples
were classified as belonging to a fixation if the velocity of the movement to the gaze point
was less than or equal to 30 degrees/sec, a value that typically provides good results for
psychological research (Olsen and Matos, 2012). The eye-tracking system provides a
software reading of the sampling accuracy rate for each participant (i.e., the percent of gaze
samples that provide adequate data to identify the position of left and right eye gaze
points). We used a threshold of 80% sampling accuracy to retain subject data for further
analysis, a standard setting for eye-tracker systems without head restraint (Poynter, Barber,
Inman, and Wiggins, 2013).
Procedure
Participants were recruited through the University's research pool. All students in
general psychology have the option of participating in experiments within the department
or, alternatively, writing a research paper on a psychological topic of their choosing. Since
the paper is a viable option that some students do choose, no one was coerced to participate
in this study.
Participants arrived for the study in groups and completed a brief demographic
Gaze pattern variations among men when assessing female attractiveness

questionnaire. They were then tested individually in the eye-tracker lab. Once seated, the
eye-tracker was calibrated for the specific participant, who then viewed a series of
photographic images of female models (full body, fully dressed). The original study
utilized four different females, with hair color systematically varied by computer-morphing
across models. The models were rated first for attractiveness and, in a second series of
viewing, for estimated age. The present analysis utilized only the attractiveness data, and
for only the first model. Participants viewed all four models, each with a varying
randomized hair color, since the original study used hair color as a variable. Representation
of hair color was also controlled for so at the end of the 60 participants each model had
been shown an equal amount of times in each hair color.
Analyses
Our general hypothesis was that male subjects may be meaningfully grouped into
categories based on eye-gaze patterns when viewing female models. This hypothesis was
tested using latent class analysis (Mplus; Muthen and Muthen, 2010), with key "areas of
interest" (AOIs) serving as grouping variables. The eye-tracker device allows the
researcher to predefine specific AOIs on which eye-tracking variables are based. In this
study, AOIs were: hair, face, breasts, waist, hips, and full picture acting as a total value.
Specifically, grouping variables for the latent class analyses were defined as the amount of
gaze time spent on each of the first five AOIs expressed as a percentage of total time.
Results
We ran 1-, 2-, and 3-class analyses and tested for best model fit (see Table 1). The
statistical indices clearly revealed that a 2-class solution fit the data best. Specifically, the
LRT value for the 2-class solution indicated that it was statistically superior to a 1-class
solution, and the LRT for the 3-class solution was not significantly better than that for the
2-class solution. The 2-class solution provided an excellent fit to the data with the entropy
value being relatively close to 1.00 (entropy = .866) and all mean posterior probabilities
being larger than .70 (see Table 2). Approximately 70% of respondents were in class 1 and
30% in class 2. We then had Mplus calculate probable class membership for each
participant, forming two groups. A MANOVA was conducted to examine group
differences on all five dependent variables as a group, followed by univariate analyses for
each AOI. The multivariate test was significant (Wilks' (5, 54) = .266, p = .000, partial
eta square = .734), indicating that the five dependent variables differed overall between the
two groups. Univariate tests indicated that the groups did not differ significantly with
regard to the hair AOI, but they differed significantly on all of the other four dependent
variables (see Table 3 for means and mean-difference test results). Class 1 males exhibited
a strong orientation toward face, with only minimal gaze time at other AOIs, whereas Class
2 males, while still spending the majority of gaze time on face, distributed time much more
evenly among the other AOIs. Figures 1a and 1b provide examples of individual subjects'
tracking data for each class.

Discussion
The current study was designed to explore the possibility that "types" of gaze
patterns exist among male subjects when viewing female images, and to this extent the
study was successful. Latent class analysis revealed that the data were best described by
two classes of subjects. Class 1 subjects ("face only") focused almost exclusively on the
facial area when making attractiveness judgments, whereas Class 2 subjects also relied
heavily on facial features, but to a lesser extent than Class 1 subjects, including other areas
of interest as well. The overall dominance of facial gazing in both groups is consistent with
the body of literature on mate attraction (e. g., Rhodes, 2006). Despite the literature on hair
length and quality as a predictor of youth and attractiveness, hair was the only area of
interest on which the two latent classes did not predict youth and attractiveness. It is
possible that tampering with the models' hair colors may have had an effect; however, in
debriefing, none of the participants indicated knowledge of tampering with the hair, and
most seemed rather surprised by the fact when told.

The systematic gaze pattern differences revealed in this analysis are highly relevant
to evolutionary psychological research, and possibly to researchers in other areas who
employ eye-tracker technology. This source of individual differences raises the possibility
of Type II error, failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The
systematic variation among subjects is treated statistically as error variance, lowering
statistical power. Isolating systematic individual differences in gaze pattern may allow
researchers to quantify it, and perhaps use pattern groupings as covariates, in order to
increase the statistical power of the design.
Limitations of the current study include the low to modest sample size (60) and the
general homogeneity of the sample (all college males taking introductory psychology at a
rural state university). Latent class analysis with larger and more diverse samples may well
identify more and/or different gaze patterns. Future research should, thus, include larger
samples, and perhaps utilize a larger number of AOIs.

A key issue is the nature of the stimulus material. Assuming that our findings do, in
fact, generalize meaningfully, to what extent would the identified gaze patterns emerge
with different stimuli? Using erotic stimuli, we would certainly expect variations in gaze
patterns overall, but would latent classes of gaze pattern emerge? Similarly, using non-
sexual stimuli, such as landscapes or other pictures, with tasks totally different from rating
attractiveness (or age, etc.), would systematic clusters of individual differences in gaze
pattern occur?
The current findings should be seen as preliminary, but researchers working with
eye-tracker technology should certainly take note of the differential gaze patterns identified
here. These results are especially relevant with regard to evolutionary psychological
research.
