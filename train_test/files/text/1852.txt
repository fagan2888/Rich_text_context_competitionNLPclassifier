Previous research has reported reduced serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD), although the relationship between vitamin D
status and insulin resistance (IR) in patients with CKD has not
been examined in the general population. We examined the
association that kidney function, based on glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) estimated from serum creatinine, has
with serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and components
of the metabolic syndrome among 14679 participants in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III). In this analysis, adjusted mean serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly lower only in the
participants with a severe (15­29ml/min/1.73m2) decrease in
eGFR compared to those with normal kidney function (61.6
vs 73.3 nmol/l, P ¼ 0.0063). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamnin D
(P ¼ 0.0018) and level of kidney function (P ¼ 0.0003) were
inversely associated, independent of each other, with
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR), adjusting for confounders. Participants with
high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (481nmol/l) had lower
HOMA-IR. We conclude that 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency
is not as prevalent in the US general population with
decreased eGFR as previously reported in patients with CKD;
and that vitamin D and kidney function have independent
inverse associations with IR.

Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are the measure of
body stores of vitamin D.1 A reduction of serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D levels, the substrate for the kidney and
other tissues for the generation of calcitriol (1,25(OH)2
D3
),
produces secondary hyperparathyroidism,2­4 reduced bone
mineral density,4 and increased rates of hip fracture5 in
individuals with normal kidney function. The parathyroid
hormone­vitamin D axis plays a central role in calcium and
phosphate homeostasis in patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD).6 The recent Kidney Disease Outcomes
Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Bone
Mineral Metabolism and Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease
have recommended the measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin
D levels in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4|the rationale
being that low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are likely to
play a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyr-
oidism by limiting the synthesis of calcitriol (1,25(OH)2
D3
).7
Vitamin D has also been recognized to have numerous
non-calcemic functions.8 Specifically, there is increasing
evidence that vitamin D metabolism affects the risk of
insulin resistance (IR), diabetes, and of the metabolic
syndrome,9­11 although the underlying molecular mechanism
of this association remains to be elucidated.
Recently, human studies have shown diminished insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake in uremic patients.12 IR in patients
with kidney disease is accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and
glucose intolerance.13,14 Chen et al.15 identified a significant
relationship between IR, insulin levels, and risk of CKD
defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
o60 ml/min/1.73 m2 among 6453 persons without diabetes.
Thus, kidney dysfunction appears to be associated with a
syndrome of IR and several explanations have been proposed,
including, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, or uremic tox-
ins.16,17 Given that a number of investigators9­11 have shown
that low vitamin D levels are associated with various
measures of impaired glucose metabolism and diabetes risk
in people with normal kidney function, it seems reasonable
to propose that IR in patients with CKD may also be
associated with reduced levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

population level. Previous reports come from small clinic-
based samples6,18,19 and may not represent the true associa-
tion between vitamin D status and kidney function in the
general population. However, the survey with the largest
number of people with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
measurements (nearly 20 000) appears to be the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), a national cross-sectional survey representa-
tive of the US population carried out in 1988­1994. The large
number of people with concurrent blood measurements of
25-hydroxyvitamin D, fasting glucose, insulin, and kidney
function provides an ideal opportunity to determine whether
vitamin D status is related to IR in participants with CKD.
RESULTS
Variables associated with vitamin D
Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were
higher in males than females and declined with increasing
age. There were significant ethnic variations in 25-hydro-
xyvitamin D levels, reflected in means that were higher in
non-Hispanic whites, intermediate in Mexican Americans,
and lower in non-Hispanic blacks (Table 1). Mean serum
vitamin D levels decreased with increasing body mass index
(BMI) quintile, and increased with increasing frequency
in the last month of physical activity and of drinking milk
or having milk on cereal, and with increasing daily dose
of vitamin D supplements (Table 1). The weighted percent
of participants with mild, moderate, and severe kidney
dysfunction taking vitamin D of 4400 IU/day was 22.6%
(95% confidence interval 20.8, 24.5), 24.6% (95% confidence
interval 20.7, 28.5), and 11.2% (95% confidence interval 0.5,
22.0), respectively.
Vitamin D levels in participants with decreased kidney
function
The adjusted mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were
mildly increased in participants with mildly decreased kidney
function (eGFR, 60­89 ml/min/1.73 m2) and decreased in
those with severely decreased kidney function (eGFR,
15­29 ml/min/1.73 m2), compared to participants with nor-
mal kidney function (eGFR490 ml/min/1.73 m2) (Table 1).
The decreased mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in those with
severe kidney dysfunction, being 61.6 (4.1) nmol/l remained
after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, BMI, physical
activity, intake of milk, and vitamin D supplements and
month of year ­ indicating that none of these variables
explained the low mean vitamin D level in this group.
Components of the metabolic syndrome, fasting insulin
levels, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin
resistance in participants with decreased kidney function
The components of the metabolic syndrome: (1) abdominal
obesity, (2) blood pressure, (3) high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, (4) triglycerides, and (5) fasting glucose as well as
insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment of insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) were evaluated by eGFR category
(Table 2). Mean BMI and waist circumference, both measures
of body fat, were raised in participants with mild, moderate,
and severe kidney dysfunction compared to those with
normal kidney function. The fasting insulin concentration
was significantly higher in participants with mild, moderate,
and severe kidney dysfunction, reflecting a state of hyper-
insulinemia. Concomitantly, there was an inverse relationship
between eGFR and insulin sensitivity after adjusting for age,
sex, ethnicity, and BMI (Table 2). Thus, HOMA-IR was
significantly higher in participants with mild, moderate, and
severe decrease in kidney function, compared to those with
normal kidney function, independent of obesity level.
Furthermore, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were
higher in participants with kidney dysfunction, whereas high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower only in
participants with moderate and severely impaired kidney
function, compared to those with normal function. Both
systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly
higher in participants with moderate decrease in eGFR
compared to those with normal eGFR. Participants with and
without antihypertensive treatment had significantly higher
HOMA-IR and insulin levels at all stages of kidney
dysfunction when compared to patients with normal kidney
function (eGFR490 ml/min/1.73 m2) (data not shown).
Decreased kidney function, vitamin D, and HOMA-IR
To further evaluate the relationship between eGFR, 25-
hydroxyvitamin D levels, and IR, we stratified participants
according to level of kidney dysfunction and quartile of
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Table 3). Stage of kidney
dysfunction and quartile of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were each
inversely associated with levels of HOMA-IR and fasting
insulin, adjusting for demographic variables and BMI,
indicating that eGFR function and 25-hydroxyvitamin D
have independent associations with IR. No evidence of a
statistical significant interaction between these two variables
in level of IR was observed (P40.05).
DISCUSSION
There are several important findings in this study. In this
analysis, we have demonstrated in a large sample representa-
tive of the adult US population that significant vitamin D
insufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D 40­75 nmol/l), as defined
by the recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative
Clinical Practice Guidelines for Bone Mineral Metabolism
and Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease, is only present in
participants with severely decreased kidney function (GFR,
15­29 ml/min/1.73 m2) and that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
in those with mildly (GFR, 60­89 ml/min/1.73 m2) and
moderately (GFR, 30­59 ml/min/1.73 m2) decreased kidney
function are not lower than levels in participants with normal
kidney function (GFR490 ml/min/1.73 m2). Moreover, the
decreased serum vitamin D levels in people with severely
decreased kidney function is independent of age, gender,
ethnicity, and lifestyle variables known to affect vitamin D
status, such as BMI, physical activity, and intake of milk and

vitamin D supplements. In conjunction with previous
studies, this analysis highlights the direct relation-
ship between kidney disease, IR, and other components of
the metabolic syndrome. This analysis suggests that the
association between kidney disease and IR is independent
of vitamin D status.
To our knowledge, there are few reports of 25-hydro-
xyvitamin D levels at varying degrees of decreased kidney

CKD patients, median values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
in those with GFR of 60­90, 40­60, and 20­40 ml/min/1.73 m2
were 30, 47, and 45 nmol/l. In a Japanese cohort19 of 76
CKD patients with GFR of 20­50 ml/min/1.73 m2, 47% had
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 40 nmol/l and 76% had
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 65 nmol/l. Most recently
in a US study,6 which only included 43 CKD patients not
requiring dialysis with a calculated GFR of 111­11 ml/min/
1.73 m2, 86% had 25-hydroxivitamin D levels consistent with
vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Interpretation of
previous work is complicated by the lack of uniform
definition of the categories of kidney dysfunction and by
the diversity in the ethnicity of the patient population.
Evidence7,20 exists that calcitriol (1,25(OH)2
D3
) levels
may be more dependent on the availability of 25-hydro-
xyvitamin D in patients with impaired kidney function than
in patients with normal kidney function. Our data would
suggest that 25-hydroxyvitamin D stores in patients with
kidney disease appear to be sufficient for calcitriol synthesis
until severe decreased kidney function (GFR, 15­29 ml/min/
1.73 m2) is established.
Recent studies15,16,21 have shown that IR correlates linearly
with decline in kidney function. In our analysis, we have also

demonstrated that kidney function is associated with IR and
other components of the metabolic syndrome, such as blood
pressure and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, even when
the eGFR is above the severe range. Although no differences
were noted in fasting glucose levels between the eGFR groups,
triglycerides showed the same pattern as insulin, with levels
increasing as eGFR declined, after adjustment for BMI. The
presence of IR in patients with kidney dysfunction is of
interest because it may contribute to preglomerular vaso-
dilatation and glomerular hypertension.22,23 Moreover, the
association of IR and hypertriglyceredemia in patients with
kidney disease might also explain the excessive cardiovascular
risk of patients with CKD.16,17,24
Epidemiological studies of the general population have
indicated a close association between insulin sensitivity,
diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome with serum levels of
25-hydrovitamin D.9­11 We have shown an inverse association
between 25-hydroxyvitamn D levels and HOMA-IR in the
general population. The lack of interaction between 25-
hydroxyvitamin D and degree of kidney dysfunction on level
of IR suggests that both variables affect IR by independent
mechanisms. HOMA-IR was only decreased in participants
with serum 25-hydrovitamin D 481 nmol/l. This cutpoint is
well above the 25-hydrovitamin D level recommended by the
recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical
Practice Guidelines for Bone Mineral Metabolism and
Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease. Almost all tissues and
cells in the body possess vitamin D receptors, including
brain, heart, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle cells, pancreas,
activated T and B lymphocytes, and monocytes.8,25,26
Pancreas and skeletal muscle,27 key components of the IR
syndrome might be a potential explanation of the association
of IR and 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency.
The current study has several strengths. First, NHANES III
used uniform methods to collect data on 25-hydroxyvitamin
D, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR. Second, the NHANES III
design allows results to be extrapolated to the entire US
civilian non-institutionalized population of the early 1990s.
Despite the comprehensive nature of the data set, there are
limitations inherent in cross-sectional design. We cannot be
certain that vitamin D status affected IR rather than vice
versa. Further, there are no direct measures of GFR and
insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose
clamp) in this study. However, the measurement error from
estimating these two variables is likely to have been non-
differential, resulting in attenuation of associations with
other variables observed in this report.28
In summary, our study has shown that significant 25-
hydrodyvitamin D insufficiency, as defined by the recent
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative mineral meta-
bolism guidelines, is encountered in people with CKD stage
4, and that 25-hydroxyvitamin D stores in early stages of
kidney disease appear to be adequate. In addition, IR is
present in early stages of kidney dysfunction and has an
inverse association with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. As IR is
a known cardiovascular risk factor, the correlation found in
our study would suggest the hypotheisis that low serum levels
of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is a potential cardiovascular risk
factor and that serum calcidiol levels higher than those
presently reccomended for CKD patients might decrease the
risk for cardiovascular disease.29 Further studies are needed
to confirm our findings and to determine possible mecha-
misms of any preventive effect from 25-hydroxyvitamin D
against IR in patients with kidney dysfunction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention carried out a cross-sectional survey
representative of the US civilian non-institutionalized population
during 1988­1994 (called NHANES III). A stratified, multistage
sampling design was used, with over-sampling of non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican-Americans. Participants were recruited from
household clusters, and initially interviewed at home, followed by an
extensive physical examination carried out at mobile examination
centers. Full details of the survey methods, including sampling,
interview, examination, and laboratory measurement of blood
samples, have been published.30
In the home interview, information was collected on a wide
range of variables including: age, sex, ethnicity (self-assigned as
either non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American,
Other), past history of ever being told by a doctor or other health
professional of having hypertension or diabetes, and whether
currently taking antihypertensive medication.30 Information was
also collected at the home interview on the following covariates: the
frequency of intake of milk and supplements (including vitamin D)
in the previous month; and the number of times a range of common
physical activities were undertaken during leisure time in the
previous month. Metabolic equivalents were assigned for each
physical activity, and participants classified as doing moderate or
vigorous activity based on their age.31
At the mobile examination centers, participants were dressed in
underpants, disposable light clothing, and slippers while being
weighed on electronic scales in kilograms, to two decimal places.
Height was measured with a fixed stadiometer to the nearest
millimeter. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters. Blood pressure was measured at the
mobile examination centers by physicians with mercury sphygmo-
manometers using a standard protocol.30
Blood samples collected during the examination were centri-
fuged, aliquoted, and frozen to À701C on site, and shipped on dry
ice to central laboratories where they were stored at À701C until
analysis.30 Serum creatinine measurements were performed at a
central laboratory (White Sands Research Center, Almogordo, NM,
USA) by means of the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction using a Hitachi
737 analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) and reported using conventional units (1 mg/dl ¼ 88.4 mmol/
l). The levels of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total
cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured enzymatically with a
Hitachi 704 Analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indiana-
polis, IN, USA). The serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
concentration was calculated using the Friedewald equation (i.e.,
low-density lipoprotein ¼ total cholesterolÀhigh density cholesterolÀ
triglyceride/5).30
eGFR was estimated using the following equation from the
Modification of Diet in Kidney Dysfunction Study, after subtracting

GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) ¼ 186.3*(serum creatinine)À1.154*ageÀ0.203*
(0.742 for women)*(1.21 if African-American).
Plasma glucose was measured by a modified hexokinase
enzymatic method, and separate radioimmunoassay methods used
to measure serum insulin.30 HOMA-IR was calculated using fasting
glucose and insulin measurements ((fasting insulin (mU/ml)*fasting
glucose (mmol/l))/22.5).33 Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was mea-
sured by a radioimmunoassay after extraction with acetonitrile.30
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ranged from 8.7 to
243.6 nmol/l not including one person with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D
value of 400.1 nmol/l.
A total of 16 573 adults X20 years attended mobile examination
centers. Data in this report are restricted to non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American adults X20
years who attended the mobile examination centers (n ¼ 14 679).
The following participants were excluded: `Other' ethnicity
(n ¼ 662), missing serum creatinine (n ¼ 1019), GFR category 5
(n ¼ 24), calculated GFR abnormally high (4200 ml/min/1.73 m2;
n ¼ 117), and missing 25-hydroxyvitamin D including one indivi-
dual with a very high outlying 25-hydroxyvitamin D value of
400.1 nmol/l (n ¼ 72).
Statistical analyses were carried out with SUDAAN (version 9.0),
using the sampling weights for the mobile examination centers to
adjust for over-sampling of non-Hispanic black and Mexican-
Americans, so that the data were representative of the US civilian
non-institutionalized population, and to correct standard errors for
any design effect arising from clustered sampling. For analyses of the
blood variables (glucose, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-IR) collected
from those who attended the morning examination after fasting
more than 8 h, analyses were restricted to those without diagnosed
diabetes and with a sampling weight for the morning examination
(n ¼ 6072). The REGRESS procedure was used to estimate adjusted
means of continuous outcome variables. For variables with skewed
distributions (triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR), the natural
logarithm was used in statistical analyses and tolerance factors (anti-
loge
(1.96 Â s.e.)) calculated in place of standard errors. The Wald
F-test was used to assess dose­response.
