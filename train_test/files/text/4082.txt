Introduction
Since the Ottawa Charter and the Epp Report in the 1980s,
Canadian official documents and academic literature have
strongly emphasized the need for individuals, communities,
and organized groups to participate in initiatives related to
their health and well-being (Goodman et al., 1998). The
axiomatic argument behind this emphasis is that, for these
programs to be effective, the people for which a program is
intended should have a voice in the design and implementa-
tion of these interventions, as people's participation depends
on what they consider meaningful and relevant in the con-
text of their visions, experiences, and values (Jackson et al.,
2003; Minkler & Wallerstein, 2007; Smith, Littlejohns,
Hawe, & Sutherland, 2008).
Public institutions have echoed these community and par-
ticipatory principles throughout Canada, and they are part of
most official documents. For example, the Provincial Wellness
Plan (PWP) in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) asserts that
it "reflects an increased focus on a shared responsibility for
health and provides direction for promoting health, preventing
illness and injury, and increasing the capacity of individuals,
groups, communities and sectors to take action for wellness"
(Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2006).
Although practitioners and researchers in the fields of
health promotion and disease prevention have earnestly
embraced the rhetoric of community capacity building and
the related notions of community organizing, community
development, and social capital, working with a community
approach is not as straightforward a task as some literature
might lead us to believe (Labonte, 2007; Syme, 2004). This
article addresses some of these challenges through a case
study of two projects funded by the Provincial Wellness
Grants in NL, a province where community ties and support
systems have been traditionally strong and important. Our
research aim was to explore how this sense of community
would respond to proactive involvement in health and well-
ness activities as suggested by the PWP, and how this cor-
responds to our academic notions of community capacity
building.

for Health:A Critical Look
at the Practical Implications
ofThis Approach

Abstract
There is a great deal of literature examining the benefits and relevance of community participation and community capacity
building in health promotion and disease prevention endeavors.Academic literature embracing principles and commitment to
community participation in health promotion practices often neglects the complexities involved and the flexibility required
to work within this approach.This article addresses some of these challenges through a case study of two projects funded by
Provincial Wellness Grants in Newfoundland and Labrador, a province in Canada with a strong tradition of community ties
and support systems. In addition to addressing the unique circumstances of the community groups, this research allowed the
authors to examine the situational context and power relations involved in the provision of services as well as the particular
forms of subjectivity and citizenship that the institutional practices support. Recognizing this complex interdependency is an
important step in creating more effective intervention practices.

TheVarious Meanings
of Community and
Community Capacity Building
Chaskin (2001) defines community capacity building as "the
interaction of human capital, organizational resources, and
social capital existing within a given community that can be
leveraged to solve collective problems, and improve or main-
tain the well being of that community" (p. 295). Most related
literature elaborates on the multiple dimensions involved in
community capacity as well as discusses pathways for its
implementation and/or evaluation (Baker & Teaser-Polk,
1998; Chaskin, 2001; Smith, Littlejohns, & Thompson,
2001). Where the positivist approach prevails, the goal is
mainly the measurement of these dimensions (Goodman
et al., 1998; Hawe, King, Noort, Jordens, & Lloyd, 2000;
Maclellan-Wright et al., 2007). The participants in most
empirical, quantitative studies have usually been volunteers
or staff from health promotion agencies or organizations
structured in coalitions (Berger, 2005; Chavis, 2001; Cramer,
Atwood, & Stoner, 2006; Francisco, Paine, & Fawcett, 1993)
and have rarely involved grassroots members of society
(Jackson et al., 2003).
From a more critical perspective, other authors have ques-
tioned the use of the community capacity building approach
in research and intervention, highlighting the contested
aspects of community and community capacity building
(Craig, 2007; Diamond, 2004; Mowbray, 2005; Simpson,
Wood, & Daws, 2003; Williams, 2004). One of the criticisms
is that projects that promote "capacity" and "self-sufficiency"
may be guises through which governments minimize their
accountability for larger social ills. Community capacity
building projects may act as a means to boost the reputations
of politicians and government officials, playing upon the well-
intentioned connotations that surround the concepts of com-
munity, community capacity, and social capital (Mowbray,
2005). This diverts attention from the larger causes of socio-
economic disparities to the responsibility of the individuals
living in lower income communities, thereby placing blame
on the victim and focusing on "defective" populations (Craig,
2007; Mowbray, 2005; Williams, 2004).
An intermediate position considers that community capac-
ity and its various dimensions are operational guidelines to
be monitored or evaluated with participants (Labonte &
Laverack, 2001a). From this perspective, the ideas of pro-
cess and outcome are interdependent, mutually benefiting
the outcomes of health promotion programs and the partici-
pants involved (Labonte & Laverack, 2001a, 2001b; Labonte,
Woodard, Chad, & Laverack, 2002). According to Labonte
and Laverack (2001a), community capacity can be more
adequately defined as a descriptor of "social and organiza-
tional relationships . . . with dynamic qualities rather than
static properties" (p. 112). This creates an extra challenge for
the health promotion planning process, as it involves incor-
porating a capacity building relationship. This relationship
implies a kind of interaction that favors values of equity and
respect, and facilitates participation, leadership, organiza-
tional structures, resource mobilization, and critical assess-
ment. These qualities depend not only on internal aspects of
individuals and social groups but also on the availability and
quality of public infrastructure (Hawe et al., 2000; Labonte
& Laverack, 2001a; Laverack, 2006a, 2006b).
The underlying assumption of community in most com-
munity capacity building endeavors is of a definable, homo-
geneous group or a social unit with some kind of affiliation
(geographical, social/institutional, and psychological), work-
ing with external agents that provide support. The problem
with this assumption is the romanticized way the term com-
munity tends to be used (Labonte, 2007). As expressed by
Labonte (2007), "community ceased to be a subject (a group
of people acting with their own intent), and became an object
(community as a target of health programs) or an adjective
accompanying the real subjects" (p. 83).
This objectification of the term community usually under-
estimates cultural complexities existing in any group of peo-
ple, such as different interests, perspectives, and experiences.
It also ignores the power relations as well as the fluid and
situational nature of human groups (Chiu, 2008). We agree
with Walter (2007), who suggests approaching community
as a "multi-dimensional-dynamic system (people and orga-
nizations, consciousness, actions, and context) of which we
are a part" (p. 68). This approach, Walter asserts, "enables us
to see ourselves and each other as part of a dynamic system
that is continually being created and re-created and that
affects and is affected by our consciousness and actions" (p.
70). Consciousness, as part of our subjectivity, involves life
stories, sense of identities, language and cultural values, as
well as awareness of power relations. All of these play a cen-
tral role in our social interactions and the kind of social com-
mitments we get involved in (Freire, 1974). It is also clear
that by living in social relations, every person or organiza-
tion is potentially a part of different communities.
For the purpose of this research, we defined community
as an orientation for action, as the research dynamic was
intended to be a facilitating process to foster assets, resources,
and networking possibilities (Simpson et al., 2003; Smith
et al., 2008; Walter, 2007).
Method and Methodology
Methodology:A Qualitative
Research Paradigm
Considering that every community group has unique cir-
cumstances, we chose to study local dynamics through a
participatory action-research agenda that was framed as
strengths-based, focused on the process, and sustained in
notions of sharing power or power/with through open dialog
(Minkler & Wallerstein, 2007; Walter, 2007). Three particu-
lar features characterize participatory action research: shared
Traverso-Yepez et al. 3
ownership of the research project, community-based identi-
fication and analysis of social problems, and an orientation
toward using research results to facilitate community action
and change (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000). Incorporating
these features ensures that research is conducted in a manner
consistent with community values and that the research pro-
cess and findings are relevant to the people involved.
Method:The Research Process
In the first stage, we performed a literature review, with a
special focus on the different community capacity building
frameworks and evaluation tools that have been developed
both in Canada and internationally. We also contacted pro-
vincial and regional health and wellness authorities to form
an advisory committee to support the research team. This
research was approved by the Human Investigations
Committee of Memorial University in August 2009.
Selecting community group participants. The selection criteria
as defined in the research proposal were (a) a community group
that is fairly conscious of/experienced in the affirming and
challenging elements inherent in the process of community
capacity building and that will welcome additional support
from the research-intervention process and (b) a community
group relatively inexperienced in community capacity building
and uncertain of how to form relationships that will enhance
their initiative, contribute to its successful execution, and dis-
seminate the knowledge and experiences acquired.
Notably, within these criteria, the selection of the pro-
grams submitted was solely based on the quality of the
funded proposals, as evaluated by the Provincial Wellness
Committee. After a thorough study of 32 health promotion
initiatives from the region funded by the PWP for 2010, we
selected two community initiatives from one of the nine rural
regions in the province: (a) one focused on a community
kitchen program at a community center in a social housing
neighborhood of the largest town (about 4,000 inhabitants)
in the region and (b) another more generally focused on
wellness activities developed at the community center of a
small town in an isolated area of the same region. To pre-
serve the confidentiality of the individuals and their places of
residence, we refer to the two participating community
groups as "Site A" and "Site B."
A Provincial Wellness consultant facilitated initial con-
tact, and we prepared a two-page informative summary for
our first meeting with the two groups. The meeting included
a motivational presentation of the research and objectives,
highlighting the tenets of the participatory-action research
approach and an open discussion to enable the groups to
determine their interest in participating in the research
project.
Research methods. In addition to the literature review, we
collected data through participant observation, informal con-
versations, group interviews, and individual interviews. Two
key informant interviews provided the opportunity for
service providers from the region to expand on their personal
experiences (Murray, Pullman, & Rodgers, 2003).
Participants signed informed consent forms before every
group discussion at both sites. The attendants were usually
divided into smaller groups of three or four to discuss the
questions and later presented their answers to the entire group.
The data from this later group discussion were recorded
and transcribed. In each new meeting, the principal investi-
gator (PI), responsible for the data collection process, sys-
tematically presented the main points from the previous
meeting for participants to confirm or comment on. From
May to December 2010, we held four group discussions
and six individual interviews at Site A, with a variable
number of participants ranging from 6 to 13. At this site, in
addition to the PI and a research assistant, the community
kitchen facilitator and a staff member from the neighbor-
hood attended the group meetings. Most of the group par-
ticipants at this site were female, with the exception of
three males in one of the sessions (1 staff member and
2 participants).
At Site B, all participants were female and the two mem-
bers of the research team were the only nonresidents.
Participants at this site decided to have only group sessions,
and we jointly planned and held four meetings with a vari-
able number of participants (5-34). A possible explanation
of this preference may be that they felt they had greater
control and confidence over setting the agenda by publicly
revealing the extent to which their views were shared by
peers. However, a known drawback to group discussion and
focus groups is that participants may not be as candid in
group settings as they would be in private, clinical settings
(Wilkinson, 1998). Also, the moral dimension of health
tends to limit the degree of disclosure in public settings, as
opposed to private, face-to-face interactions (Radley &
Billig, 1996).
Considering the differences between the sites, we have
organized the data from each place according to the guid-
ing themes: participants' ideas about personal and com-
munity health, how they framed community capacities or
strengths, and how they felt with regard to their funded
program.
From the beginning, we realized that although we
expressed our openness to work with the participants in a
participatory action-research agenda and they accepted,
this was still our idea rather than theirs. Because the
research was not an initiative coming from the partici-
pants, we were seen as authority figures no matter how we
framed our role in the research process. On occasion we
felt that participants' responses were being tailored to fit
what they believed the researchers wanted to hear.
Therefore, the analysis of the data will explore interactions
between participants' accounts and the research context,
the institutional health agenda, and the ways the social and
institutional environment has built particular forms of sub-
jectivity and citizenship.
4 SAGE Open
Overview of Findings
General Social Background
The area where both research sites are located is one of the
nine regions of the Rural Secretariat in NL. Almost half of
the population is concentrated within the two central towns,
located near one another, and the other half is widely dis-
persed in the vast region. The main economic activities
include tourism, seafood processing plants, and one medium-
sized industry. Like other rural areas, the region faces many
challenges, including a stagnant economy, increasing out-
migration rates, decreasing employment levels, and an aging
population (Eastern Health, 2006).
Interviews with regional service providers highlighted
that members of communities in the region generally adopt a
skeptical attitude toward newcomers. This is most noticeable
among the older population. Communities tend to remain
isolated due to geography and shy away from talk of amalga-
mation. We found that mistrust came from the struggle to
allocate scarce resources. However, participants recognized
that the amalgamation of schools has promoted contact and
acceptance among youth from different communities.
Another barrier they identified was the lack of public trans-
portation in the area. Specifically, public transportation was
restricted to a local taxi service. In addition, people do not
want to travel after dark or in the winter due to road condi-
tions and isolation. In other cases, individuals are unable to
afford travel due to cost or limited access to vehicles.
Relevant social networks are limited to family and friends.
The only grassroots organization at Site A is the Tenants
Association, but members asserted that participation was
rather limited. At Site B, there is a "Recreation Committee"
and a "Come Home Committee," but the two committees
consist of many of the same people.
Most participants recognize that the older generation experi-
ences technological barriers, as knowledge of the Internet is
generally limited to the younger generations. The inconsistency
of Internet access and a lack of computer skills were acknowl-
edged as problems by participants from both research sites.
Program at Site A
The program's main focus was on a community kitchen, but it
also examined other areas related to health and well-being such
as physical activity, tobacco control, and environmental health.
The community center, mainly funded by the Newfoundland
and Labrador Housing Corporation, was responsible for run-
ning the program. The center provides services for approxi-
mately 110 families living in the neighborhood, of which fewer
than 25% of the family heads are employed.
Summary of the Collected Data
Program Background. The community kitchen program was
started by volunteers in 2007, with a small group of consistent
participants both from within the neighborhood and from
without. The program was, at the time of the research (2010),
facilitated by a paid community kitchen coordinator in
biweekly sessions with four to six participants per session due
to the limited size of the kitchen. Although they received the
funding from the Provincial Wellness Grants Program, partici-
pants emphasized that the main problem was the sustainability
of the kitchen due to the loss of momentum when funding
expires. This was a permanent concern, as organizations can
only apply for grants once per program. A staff member
expressed that for the past 3 years, each time the community
kitchen exhausted its funding it also lost connections with the
people who had been attending its cooking sessions. A lack of
funding might result in the loss of the kitchen program coordi-
nator, which could be another setback to maintaining relation-
ships with participants of the program.
Health Concerns. The first session focused around the ques-
tion "What things are most important to me in terms of my
health?" The main issues identified by the group interviews
included (a) quitting smoking, (b) healthy eating, (c) more
volunteering and involvement in community life, (d) exercise/
active lifestyle, and (e) access to sports and recreation activi-
ties. In all of the sessions, people highlighted how important
the kitchen gatherings were for their mental health. Other
aspects mentioned included a good social life, caring for older
people, having regular checkups, laughter, meditation, being
careful to prevent injuries, and knowledge and awareness.
Throughout the research, participants emphasized healthy
eating as a priority, but it became clear that the social envi-
ronment plays a strong role in defining eating habits and
food choices. In one interview, we learned that a participant
in her late 50s had never eaten uncooked greens in her life
and was not about to begin. Another interviewee explained
that she had a preference for boxed macaroni and cheese
because it tasted good and was affordable. In a group discus-
sion, it was also emphasized that not having private transpor-
tation (and having no public transport available in town)
results in many people in the neighborhood relying on frozen
or canned food rather than fresh items.
With regard to health in the community ("What things are
most important when we think about health in our communi-
ties?"), participants mentioned both the high number of
"youth with problems" and vandalism as ongoing issues.
Concerns about youth were mainly related to substance abuse
problems. Arguments to explain substance abuse included
easy access to drugs and alcohol in the neighborhood and lack
of services to help people with addiction problems. The com-
munity center staff hope to counteract the problem through
information sessions with local police and health authorities.
They noted that they expect things to improve with the
arrival of a new addictions and outreach counselor recently
hired by the regional health authority.
Concerns over the health and isolation of some seniors
were also expressed, remarking that seniors often find it too
Traverso-Yepez et al. 5
difficult "to cook just for themselves." Participants also dis-
cussed the need for outdoor and indoor spaces for physical
activity and recreation. However, one participant commented
on the difficulties of engaging people in healthy lifestyles:
despite the existence of gym equipment in the same building
where the kitchen sessions were held, the equipment was
rarely used. There is also a walking trail about six blocks
down the hill from the community center, but most partici-
pants have only taken short walks in the past, complaining
that they suffer from "shortness of breath," due to smoking
and being overweight. When one of the youngest women in
the group was vocal about her success in quitting "because
of medical advice regarding lung problems," a few others
expressed a wish to stop smoking as well, which shows the
relevance of local role models.
In two of the four group sessions, participants lamented
the lack of involvement of many people in the neighborhood,
arguing that "there is a lack of community togetherness."
Issues of trust were mentioned, for example, while discuss-
ing the failure of the Block Parent program for promoting
neighborhood safety, commenting that getting involved
"could be dangerous."
CommunityAssets.The second group meeting focused on the
strengths and assets of the community. When participants were
asked about what they considered to be positive community
resources, it was difficult for them to reflect on "community
strengths or assets." When we prompted them to express their
personal strengths, a different range of ideas came easily, from
being a supportive/caring person and volunteering to helping
elders and having good housekeeping abilities.
However, the only thing that the group mentioned with
regard to "community capacity" was "community together-
ness," referring to the large event Come Home Year 2008,
which brought many of the people in the town together.
During this event, the community kitchen set up a booth to
provide snacks, increasing the group's visibility in the com-
munity. As in the previous session, participants felt events
and gatherings are needed "to catch the interest of others in
community actions to promote health" and to make a con-
centrated effort in finding alternative funding to sustain the
community kitchen. They also emphasized as positive a
6-week program designed by the community center staff to
prepare people for working opportunities, which has been
beneficial "in raising self-esteem."
When prompted again to think of other community
strengths, group participants highlighted needs instead, includ-
ing (a) more personal commitment and community participa-
tion; (b) finding ways to help the community; (c) helping kids
to stay in school, achieve higher education, and have better
job opportunities; (d) knowing how to get a job or having
more incentive for people to get off income support; (e) a new
literacy program for all ages; (f) skills development for all
ages; (g) supporting elders, youth, single parents, and minori-
ties; (h) a neighborhood watch; (i) education for parents/
policy support; (j) social outings and recreational activities
for all ages; (k) home support for new mothers; (l) more
involvement in community well-being from government,
general population, and youth; (m) fighting against drugs
and alcohol; and (n) implementing a community van or pub-
lic transportation. Their lack of power to tackle these com-
plex issues themselves was evident throughout the research.
The Challenges of CommunityTransportation and Par-
ticipatory Engagement. During the third meeting, we
invited participants to choose a priority out of the main areas
of interest discussed in the previous session. Participants
chose to discuss the need for a community van, as the lack of
public transportation is a major issue for the people in the
neighborhood. However, it was a challenge to get people to
tackle this issue and engage in the solutions to their own
problems. The common response was "let's talk to [the direc-
tor of the center] about it to see what he can do." Participants
felt discouraged: in a previous attempt a couple of years
before, they had had a van serving the neighborhood for a few
weeks, but the service was shut down due to the influence of
the local taxi company. Events such as this illustrate how
institutionalized power relations hamper a community's sense
of control and reinforce a "why bother" attitude.
Self-evaluation survey. The final session involved a written
evaluation of the kitchen program and brainstorming of ways
to add the community garden idea to the community kitchen
project to apply for a further institutional grant. The evalua-
tion and consultation with community members was sug-
gested by the researcher, but only five participants and three
staff members were present in the final session.
The community kitchen was not only valued as a space for
health education and nutrition, but more importantly, it also
acted as a place for socializing and recreation, which might be
a far more relevant outcome to judge from people's expres-
sions and experiences. Still, a main drawback was the pro-
gram's sustainability due to the lack of consistent funding.
Participants considered the greenhouse and the community
garden positive adds-on to the community kitchen program.
They recommended that the garden be located close to the
community center so that everyone would benefit from it.
However, they also suggested fencing the garden due to pos-
sible vandalism and a lack of trust in some of their neighbors.
Reflection on Research Site A
The community center staff care about the community par-
ticipants, and community members consider staff "nice at
doing their jobs." In the service provider­client dynamic
that we observed, community members tended to rely on
community center staff to handle problems, as was noted
with the transportation issue and, previously, with the addic-
tions and vandalism problems in the area. Another evidence
of the participants' lack of initiative is the way the kitchen
6 SAGE Open
program is organized. To guarantee participation in the
kitchen sessions, the kitchen coordinator telephones to ask
who is available for the next day as a sort of invitation or
reminder. When there is only a calendar of sessions or when
there is no reminder, people tend to simply forget.
Staff members feel immense pressure to show the results of
their hard work. With inconsistent, limited, short-term fund-
ing, service providers tend to develop proposals based on what
is offered by the funding agencies. With this in mind, they
often write proposals for neighborhood programs with little or
no consultation from the potential participants. As they cannot
be sure that they will get the funding, they argue that they pre-
fer not to create expectations in the participants. Considering
the institutional setting of social assistance, the risk of devel-
oping patronizing relationships with participants is perma-
nent, perpetuating the cycle of dependency. The complexity of
this dynamic is clearly expressed by a staff member:
Here, their parents were in the system, they're in the
system, their children are in the system. And that cycle
never seems to be broken . . . they can't live without
the government now because they do not make
enough. If they go out to work for minimum wage,
they're making less than being home on social ser-
vices because then they got to pay their own rent, their
own drugs, their heat and lights.
For different reasons, lack of trust among neighbors is com-
mon, and although some families live in the neighborhood for
generations, mobility is also high due to the transient nature of
the subsidized housing program. This poses another problem in
gaining consistent participation, as some people may move as
soon as they can afford a different living arrangement.
Due to the complexity of problems arising from low-
income sectors, a focus on healthy eating proved to be very
limited in its approach, and thus it is also important to explore
ways to improve the unequal distribution of access to social
and economic resources.
Program at Site B
Following the call for grant applications, the program at Site B
focused on all the priorities of the Provincial Wellness Grant
Program, seeking to promote general good health and well-
being. The Recreation Committee, who presented the proposal,
welcomed the research project and expressed its decision to use
the grant money to support wellness activities such as seniors'
mobilization, catering for outreach events, buying sports equip-
ment such as basketballs, and for transporting people to and
from a swimming pool in another community.
Summary of the Collected Data
Program Background. The Recreation Committee, formed
by 12 women in this small community of about 200 persons,
was determined to keep the community center running and
to provide wellness activities, as the center is the only
place for socializing in the area. About 25 years ago, the
church donated the community center building to the town
and for a long time, it was used only occasionally for danc-
ing or darts.
The community is one of a group of four very small iso-
lated towns in the area with a total population of 870 people.
Although there is no history of cooperation between these
communities, things may change for the new generation as
children from all four communities now share a K-12 school.
Almost half of the population between ages 18 and 64 have
not finished high school. Out-migration has been high, and
personal income per capita (after tax) was Can$10,800 in
2006. The unemployment rate for people aged 15 and older
was 45.6%. Employment during the full year was only 13.8%
in the region. A total of 65.9% worked seasonally and sup-
plemented this income with employment insurance, whereas
12.5% received income support. The 2006 self-reliance
ratio--a measure of the community's dependence on gov-
ernment transfers--was 54.8% (Newfoundland and Labrador
Statistics Agency, 2010).
Health Concerns. As at the other research site, the focus of
the first session was to discuss the question "What things are
most important to me in terms of my health?" The three dis-
cussion groups during this session noted three areas of impor-
tance: (a) getting exercise; (b) enjoying outdoor activities,
such as gardening--a self-sustaining activity for some of the
participants; and (c) eating healthy, home-cooked food. Other
important aspects included being around their children and
doing activities with them, getting enough sleep, volunteer
work, cooperative living and support for each other, access to
community services, socializing, stress-free life, and the free-
dom of living in a small community: "a safe place for chil-
dren to grow up." Some participants smoked, but only one of
the participants, in private, mentioned quitting smoking.
In response to the question "What things are most impor-
tant when we think about health in our communities?" par-
ticipants focused on caring for their physical environment
and the outdoors. A couple of gardeners who grew vegetables
and flowers every summer suggested starting a community
garden to get children and seniors engaged in active living.
Participants also considered organizing a wellness fair to
share their ideas and experiences with the other communities
nearby, with the expectation that people in these towns may want
to join in on activities at the local recreation center or set up well-
ness activities in their own towns. Like in Site A, they also con-
sideredsocialeventsagoodstrategyforbringingpeopletogether,
as a recurrent complaint was the lack of participation.
CommunityAssets.During the second meeting, there were 25
participants and the focus was on strengths and assets in the
community. They felt positive about (a) the Entertainment/
Recreation Committee; (b) the fire brigade; (c) a small church
Traverso-Yepez et al. 7
group; (d) the "Come Home" Committee, which was organiz-
ing a gathering for 2012; (e) celebrating holidays with dances
(i.e., Halloween, Canada Day, Christmas, New Year's Eve,
Valentine's, and St. Patrick's Day); and (f) hobbies such as
fishing and gardening. In addition, they were glad that (thanks
to the community center) seniors, who were rarely active, had
become engaged in activities such as storytelling and Bingo.
A significantly gendered attitude toward active living was
highlighted. Participants asserted that when men retire or are
without work, they tend to be more sedentary than women.
As some of the women commented, they "just watch TV or
hang with friends." They spoke fondly of a now-defunct
softball team in the community, and shared the concern of
trying to engage men and youth in outdoor activities.
Conflict and Loss of Leadership. In an informal meeting
at Memorial University with the two leaders of the Recre-
ation Committee before the next scheduled group meeting,
the leaders expressed great expectations about the following
group discussion to define the activities to be developed dur-
ing the next months. Unfortunately, the scheduled meeting
was canceled because of conflict and division in the Recre-
ation Committee. These two leaders and primary contacts, as
well as two other members, resigned and stepped down from
the committee, creating a leadership void.
Meeting the Remaining Members.After the PI contacted
the remaining committee members, we organized a new
meeting with them. They discussed the positive outcomes of
the Wellness Grant, which had given them resources for
keeping the community center functioning, allowing them to
develop activities with seniors and children, to celebrate
events, and to hold an exercise class on Mondays and Thurs-
days. They emphasized that seniors enjoy meeting at the
community center and it may be the only activity outside
their home available to them. Committee members insisted
on the idea of bringing in more participants and encouraging
community members to become vocal about the future of the
Recreation Committee. They suggested a forum, decided in
favor of a written evaluation, and anticipated a high number
of participants to the event. The date was set for a week later,
and they agreed to invite a well-known regional physical
educator as a motivational guest speaker. However, without
leadership, there was less enthusiasm.
Site B self-evaluation survey and public forum. It was
notable that instead of doing the organizing themselves, the
committee decided to hire a former committee chair not liv-
ing regularly in town to organize and facilitate the public
forum, prepare the draft of the survey, and be responsible for
the reports for the Wellness Grant authorities. The limita-
tions for engaging participants were again evident, as only
13 local adults and 6 children attended. They handed in the
self-evaluation survey at the end of the meeting. All the
community members considered the community center a
positive asset, and with different expressions agreed that
they enjoy the community center events and the sense of
community these events provide. When asked about
improvements to community programs and events or sug-
gestions for new programs, most participants requested the
traditional programs and information sessions encouraging
healthy lifestyles, such as healthy cooking classes and exer-
cise programs.
Participants acknowledged in the survey that structured
programs and improvements to the community center require
participation in and commitment to administrative tasks.
However, only 2 out the 13 participants expressed willing-
ness to help in the tasks involved, and none of the partici-
pants wanted to assume a leadership role.
Reflection on Research Site B
When visiting the areas near Site B, there is a sense of how
isolated these rural communities are. Many of the houses are
only inhabited in the summertime. However, among those
who stayed year-round, it was evident that they enjoy the
isolation of the community and "living their way." At the
beginning, a sense of mistrust was expressed in informal
conversation, as a couple of participants asked the PI, "Why
do you bother coming this far?"
Except for the most outspoken leaders (who resigned), the
other members openly resisted getting involved in leadership
positions. However, despite the conflicts within the Committee
Board, a sense of community is evident in the informal rela-
tionships they maintain. They all know their neighbors, who
are often family related and are open to help in critical situa-
tions, especially with the elderly population.
Discussion of Research Findings
Although Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are often known
for their sense of community, we questioned whether this sense
of community held the same connotations as the rhetoric
around the often reified terms of community and community
capacity found in some academic definitions and official docu-
ments. This research endeavor faced limitations: the geograph-
ical distance of the research site, the short-term funding of the
programs, and the ambivalence of the programs' funding
agency with regard to involvement in the research. Our status
as "outsiders" placed additional limits on our research with
both funding agencies and community groups.
Other research efforts conducted in this rural area (Eastern
Health, 2006; Gibson & Vodden, 2010) as well as in other
regions of rural NL (Close, Rowe, & Wheaton, 2007; Gray
& Sinclair, 2005; House, 2003) have observed the locals'
cautious attitude toward outsiders as well as an evident
aversion to formal community involvement and/or assum-
ing leadership roles. Critical international literature on this
topic argues that organized grassroots groups are usually
part of the "better-off" sectors of society, whereas in many
small communities and low-income sectors, informal cul-
tures of engagement prevail (Williams, 2004).
8 SAGE Open
The evaluations of the Newfoundland and Labrador
Heart Health Program (2002; Holmes, Neville, Donovan,
& MacDonald, 2001) and the subsequent PWP (Department
of Health and Community Services--Government of
Newfoundland and Labrador, 2008) also identified that
there is a need for continued resources and efforts to
enhance leadership and the capacity to mobilize communi-
ties, to recruit and train participants, and to maintain ongo-
ing communication of shared knowledge and experiences.
As these concerns remain part of the PWP's rhetoric, the
researchers juggled this challenge with the main research
agenda, focusing on whether the PWP programs could ade-
quately engage local people within the unique context of
each group. Instead of simply accepting the official rhetoric,
the social complexities of community groups prompted the
main researcher to focus on studying the particular commu-
nity dynamic (i.e., geographic and social background) of
each program in these two different sites and explore the spe-
cific situational context as related to both institutional public
health practices and to the way services and programs are
provided. We also investigated how much participation is
influenced by the particular forms of subjectivity and citi-
zenship that the sociocultural environment is generating with
regard to health (Bunton, 2008; Lupton, 1999). We argue that
social context, institutional practices, and forms of subjectiv-
ity are intricately interdependent, and recognizing this com-
plexity might help us to reflect on ways to develop more
efficient intervention practices.
The Social Context
In the case of Site A, the program was designed as a service
to a particular neighborhood, characterized by low-income
residents and exposure to different degrees of social exclu-
sion and vulnerability (Stephens, 2008). Our research shows
that a sense of cohesion and a sense of control are very lim-
ited among people living on social assistance. Although their
health is highly influenced by the conditions in which they
live, people often seemed powerless to make any kind of
change about "the way things are," as clearly evidenced in
the case of the public transport issue. Dependency on others
to provide for them is a learned behavior and influences their
ability to make changes in their lives. They usually rely on
what paid community center staff, as intermediaries in the
provision of these programs, can provide.
We witnessed that the most popular programs in the
neighborhood are those addressing more vital services for
families, such as early childhood and children's school sup-
port, and those that provide work experience, as most of our
participants wanted to find a job. Nonetheless, the way fund-
ing is provided forces community center staff, as much as
other service providers, to offer the services within a top-
down relationship. As funding is not always guaranteed, they
are hesitant to consult with community members for fear of
creating expectations that may go unfulfilled.
Staff are usually constrained by limited economic resources
as well as by the complexity of the problems involved. People
open to receiving services tend to passively avail of what is
offered. Still, for some socially disadvantaged groups, health-
focused programs may even be perceived as an additional
source of stigma and therefore a space for resistance; this is
likely one of the reasons why some people refuse to partici-
pate (Stead, McDermott, MacKintosh, & Adamson, 2011).
The sense of community was often expressed in informal
ways through "looking out for the elderly people in the neigh-
borhood" and "caring for family and friends in need." The fact
that grassroots members in these community groups often do
not fit with our academic conceptions does not by any means
imply a lack of skill on the part of residents or even staff. More
vulnerable sectors of society are more likely to engage in
"informal" community relationships (Chappell, Funk, &
Allan, 2006; Rapport, Snook, Evans, & Tee, 2008; Williams,
2004). While these informal supportive interactions are not
often identified by community members as social capital or
community capacity, they still have beneficial effects for the
people involved. Failing to see this different kind of engage-
ment, as Williams states, "not only underemphasizes a culture
of community participation that is widespread but also ends up
imposing onto less affluent groups a relatively foreign form of
community involvement that does not mirror their current par-
ticipatory cultures" (pp. 737-738).
Similarly, there are challenges often faced by rural, iso-
lated communities in NL that were observed at Site B. One
difficulty encountered is community members conditioned
to staying within small, familial networks, "minding only
their own business." While we uncovered much evidence of
how important informal social relationships have been for
the well-being and survival of community members, there
was an overt rejection of engagement in the Recreation
Committee's tasks, which ended with the resignation of the
main leaders of the organization.
However, as Mowbray (2005) argues, government-funded
community programs may not be adequately tailored and/or
appropriate for populations with low levels of formal social
cohesion. In these cases, capacity building strategies to
engage people in the programs must be part of the human
investment, both in the case of nongovernmental organiza-
tions as well as less-structured groups lacking the necessary
organizational skills (Labonte & Laverack, 2001a, 2001b).
This fact moves us to analyze the institutional background.
The Institutional Public Health Practices
Research findings reveal that there are challenges to
participatory-action endeavors without structural support,
local resources, and contextual considerations of the manner
in which health promotion services and programs are pro-
vided (Carr, Lhussier, Wilkinson, & Gleadhill, 2008).
The broad mandate of the government funding agency
and the prevailing biomedical model of public health have
Traverso-Yepez et al. 9
institutionalized vertical forms of intervention (Bunton,
2008; Lupton, 1999). An institutional deficit-focused
approach prevails, and both service providers and lay peo-
ple have in mind this expert­health consumer relationship.
While participants were discussing the youth with prob-
lems in the neighborhood, for example, the focus was on
pathologizing the condition, disregarding the social, eco-
nomic, and political environment of the issue. The expec-
tation for a solution was then placed upon the addictions
expert. Also evidenced in the selection process and the
official literature of the PWP is the fact that the health pro-
motion interventions that receive funding are mainly
addressed to change individual lifestyles and behaviors.
The challenge remains to incorporate the role of the socio-
economic and cultural environments influencing the
"unhealthy" choices.
During the research process, we experienced firsthand
that without a joint commitment with programs' funding
agencies, our ability to support the capacity building of both
research sites was limited, as the two groups were only
accountable to the agencies from which they received fund-
ing. Although Wellness Consultants maintained sporadic
contact with both community groups throughout the research
process, Newfoundland's geography and other structural
limitations (i.e., consultants' workloads and other institu-
tional priorities) prevented the consultants from being per-
sonally involved with the researchers and participants in
these communities and from developing a parallel "empow-
ering" track, as suggested by Labonte et al. (2002), Laverack
(2004), and Laverack and Labonte (2000, 2006a, 2006b).
We contend that the level of commitment for capacity
building should function both ways: a political, top-down
conviction on what is facilitated and a bottom-up involve-
ment in what is likely to be achieved. This relationship is
always interdependent, as neither group can achieve its
goals without the other (Laverack & Labonte, 2000). To
visualize this experience, Figure 1 depicts the research
environment.
The Social Environment and Forms
of Subjectivity and Citizenship
Having highlighted the local and institutional constraints, we
would also like to highlight the strong macroeconomic forces
at work against the formation of meaningful relationships in
the society. Globalization has made governments more likely
to submit to the pressures of transnational market forces,
where policies tend to be neoliberal/market driven, encourag-
ing people to see themselves as consumers of services, rather
than as participant citizens with rights and responsibilities. In
addition to consumerism, wherein well-being is expected to
come from external sources--for example, buying and using
products and services produced by professionals and
experts--individualism is another stronghold of the market-
driven economy, as human beings are considered self-made
agents whose plans, intentions, and behaviors take place in
isolation from others and their broader environment
(Traverso-Yepez, 2008). As Bauman (2001) argues, the more
we lose a sense of being able to work with fellow citizens
toward a common goal, the more the notion of community
becomes nothing more than an idealized dream.
There is a contrast between the health promotion rhetoric
of participation and capacity building and the individualism
and consumerism trends encouraged by the economic sys-
tem. Apart from health care, vital services and programs
related to wellness in neoliberal societies like Canada's are
treated as an individual/private concern, and the current
institution of health promotion programs with limited, short-
term funding seems to mainly target the most vulnerable sec-
tors of society. This minimalistic approach does not favor the
creation and development of a sense of community.
There is also a culture of dependence on government ser-
vices, which reflects the unanticipated effect of the provision
of the social safety net in the postwar period of the 1950s; and
more importantly, in the case of rural NL, after the collapse of
the cod fishery and the moratoria imposed by the federal
government in 1992 (Ommer, 2007). Those who stayed in
rural communities moved away from self-sufficiency and
became more dependent on services provided by govern-
ment agencies.
Final Considerations
Our research demonstrates that communities are dynamic,
mobile systems formed through the specific motivations of
participants, with the power to avail (or not) of organiza-
tional resources and human and social capital to engage in
higher levels of commitment. Consequently, it is clear that
community capacity building cannot be designed or planned
from outside, but must be consensually built by the stake-
holders involved.
In our work with Sites A and B, we witnessed a demand
for a broader approach to health and more intersectoral part-
nerships at the local, municipal, regional, and provincial
Figure 1.Visualization of relationship between researchers and
other parties

levels. Distant/isolated communities and low-income sectors
of NL may benefit from partnerships between the health sec-
tor, the Rural Secretariat, and local municipalities to support
more integrated capacity building efforts. However, the
health sector and the Rural Secretariat continue working
within their own domains.
As these expectations were also beyond our power as
researchers, we experienced firsthand the importance of a
flexible program structure in addressing the unique circum-
stances of the two specific community groups (Carr et al.,
2008). We learned once again that, considering the power
relations and conflicts that are present in any social interac-
tion, whenever immersed in community actions and working
toward a common good, it seems more appropriate to think
about "community capacity building" in terms of a dynamic
set of values involving different degrees of commitment,
solidarity, and, most importantly, openness to negotiating
differences.
