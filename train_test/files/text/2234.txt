Neighborhoods have become the focus of questions about how
they affect the families that live within them. A current working
assumption of some federal policies is that, with help, households
can escape poverty neighborhoods and change their spatial con-
text. How true is this, especially for low-income households, and
does changing neighborhoods have measurable benefits? The
study uses data from the Moving to Opportunity program, initi-
ated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to
test whether policy interventions by means of housing vouchers
have aided moves away from low-poverty areas and into inte-
grated residential settings. By examining the neighborhood de-
mography of the initial and subsequent locations of the samples,
it is possible to assess the success of the objectives of decreasing
poverty and increasing integration. Although the program has
shown some success in assisting households to live in lower-
poverty neighborhoods, the findings here emphasize just how
difficult it is to intervene in dynamic processes such as housing
choice and mobility to create policy outcomes.
housing vouchers  poverty  integration
In the past decade, there has been a concerted effort to
understand just how a neighborhood can affect individual
lives. Does living in a low-income neighborhood or deprived
neighborhoods in general have an effect on people's lives, the
jobs that they have, and the health that they enjoy? Of particular
interest have been outcomes for children. Does growing up in a
poor neighborhood inhibit later life chances? This literature has
been stimulated in part by observations that poverty concentra-
tions have been increasing, and that the fixed inner-city public
housing projects of the past do not seem to have helped
low-income and minority households in their search for suitable
and safe housing. These questions about neighborhoods and
their effects have generated a substantial and growing literature
that examines the additive marginal effects of neighborhoods on
residential outcomes for inner-city poverty populations (1, 2).
That is, after controlling for the socioeconomic and demo-
graphic characteristics of the household, how much additional
variance in outcome measures do neighborhood characteristics
explain? The literature has struggled with questions of how much
variance is attributable to the neighborhood and how much is
related to family composition. Although the consensus is still
forming, evidence does appear to suggest that place of residence
does matter, certainly an outcome that is consistent with much
geographic literature on residential location and the impacts of
particular places on households (3).
Several specific studies of residential moves between neigh-
borhoods, including studies of the outcomes of residential moves
in the Gautreaux program in Chicago, the Hollman settlement
in Minneapolis, and the extensive experimental program Moving
to Opportunity (MTO), have attempted to evaluate whether
households make gains when they change neighborhoods (4).
These investigations have used a variety of approaches to
examine whether mobility can lead to improved life chances.
However, evaluations to date have focused primarily on the
initial move and have failed to recognize the impacts of ongoing
residential mobility. In this paper, I extend the analysis of
previous studies of the outcomes of residential mobility by
examining two broad sets of questions about long-term gains
from the MTO program. I use Baltimore as a case study. First,
is there evidence of living in lower-poverty neighborhoods after
residential mobility, and are the gains from residential mobility
sustained over time with subsequent moves? Second, do the
housing choices lead to living in integrated settings, and again,
do these moves to greater residential integration persist over
time? Also relevant to neighborhood outcomes are questions
about the quality of the neighborhood (including lower crime
rates), educational achievement levels, and levels of employ-
ment, but these are not examined in this study.
Neighborhoods and Mobility
Residential mobility is a highly structured process with impacts
on both the households who move and the places that they
choose in their relocation behavior. It is the basic process
whereby households improve the quality of their housing and the
type of neighborhoods that they inhabit and is intimately con-
nected with urban change as a whole (5). Moves are transitions
in people's lives, and neighborhood transitions are the conse-
quences of aggregated individual mobility transitions. Thus, over
time, the sum of the myriad decisions by individual households
leads to basic changes in the urban structure. Neighborhoods and
communities change as people move in and out of them. Over
time, these individual moves and the changes that they bring
eventually establish the population composition of neighbor-
hoods, and the patterns of land use and the associated patterns
of commuting and traffic flows. Mobility is ``a consistent and
pervasive behavior forming a major element of the policy
context; it affects the conditions under which policies are
developed and exerts a strong influence on their outcomes'' (6).
It is important to distinguish, both in new research and reviews
of past research, between individual behaviors that affect neigh-
borhoods and neighborhood effects on individuals. In the first
sense, we view mobility as the proximate cause of change,
although areas may have high mobility but be stable in popula-
tion composition. This conceptualization emphasizes individuals
as agents who move between places and who change the neigh-
borhoods that they choose. If a large number of minorities
choose a neighborhood, they change the ethnic composition of
that neighborhood, for example, although the changes also may
be more subtle, such as shifts from a neighborhood without
young families and children to a neighborhood with them.
Within this framework, we can conceptualize neighborhood
change as the outcome of individual mobility decisions. Of
course, neighborhoods change from factors other than residen-
tial mobility; planning decisions with respect to the location of
positive and negative externalities and private-sector decisions
with respect to capital expenditure also play a role.

SOCIAL SCIENCES SPECIAL FEATURE
In a second conceptualization, the focus is specifically on the
neighborhood impacts on individuals who move to that neigh-
borhood. Does the household gain from moving to a particular
neighborhood? In this conceptualization, we are asking whether
the individual benefits from the context effects of the new
neighborhood. If individuals move to a low-poverty neighbor-
hood, do they improve their lives in some sense? The emphasis
on context effects arose originally from public health concerns;
i.e., reducing concentrated poor-quality housing was seen as
necessary to improving public health. It is now clear, however,
that health has more to do with poverty than with housing per se.
Recent work on neighborhood conditions emphasizes the role
that the neighborhood plays in shaping outcomes for individuals
and households. Indeed, as we might expect, other things being
equal, people want to live in ``good'' neighborhoods and to have
their children grow up in safe environments. Thus, it is not
surprising to find the strong and growing perception among
academics and households themselves that growing up in a ``bad''
neighborhood will likely reduce children's life chances. The
reviews of neighborhood effects have tended to emphasize the
negative effects of poverty and low-income neighborhoods and
concluded that indeed there are outcomes on childhood achieve-
ment (7) and on victimization in unsafe neighborhoods (8). In
addition to examining neighborhood socioeconomic character-
istics, studies also have assessed the impact of neighborhood
environmental quality on the well-being of residents. Pauleit (9)
emphasized the role and value of ``green space'' in European
cities, and it is clear that in the Netherlands, with its long
tradition of concern with neighborhood environments, the rural
aspects of neighborhoods are often cited by residents as impor-
tant factors in residential choice (10). Work has demonstrated
that the amount of green space in the living environment also
positively affects people's (self-reported) health (11).
Anecdotal discussions of neighborhood effects on health
outcomes seem to suggest that, even after controlling for socio-
economic status, people in poor neighborhoods fare less well in
health outcomes than those in nonpoor neighborhoods (12), or
as geographers are fond of saying, geography matters. One
explanation suggests that poor neighborhoods create stress,
especially for African Americans. The day-to-day stresses of
living in areas with poor safety, violence, noise, and housing
decay create internal stresses that, in turn, lead to anxiety and
depression. Another view emphasizes that actual neighborhood
deprivation (i.e., too many bars and fast-food outlets and not
enough quality supermarkets) creates the poor health that seems
to characterize inner-city minority populations. At the same
time, much of the research concern in examining the role of
neighborhood effects is to separate out the effects of neighbor-
hood independent of family socioeconomic characteristics. This
separation is difficult because of the strong links between
household social class and neighborhood status: residents of
poor neighborhoods are likely to be poor themselves. As middle-
class African-American households left inner-city neighbor-
hoods, they left behind the most impoverished minority house-
holds; it is these households who are often most affected by both
their socioeconomic status and the neighborhoods that they
live in.
It is in this context that the mobility programs have directly
investigated the actual effect of neighborhood on the outcomes
for those who move into new, more desirable neighborhoods. In
broad terms, the mobility programs have a central policy aim to
move households from perceived bad neighborhoods to per-
ceived good neighborhoods. Such studies have attempted to
separate the true effects of neighborhoods from the effects of
families or social networks on the outcomes (13). Tentative
results indicated that those who moved to suburban neighbor-
hoods were more likely to be employed and experienced greater
neighborhood safety.
At least some of the stimulus for the refocus on neighborhood
effects was increasing concern with high poverty concentrations
(14). Although why and how poverty concentrations arise remain
contested, there has been a consensus that the concentration of
households with housing assistance in specific neighborhoods has
not only a negative life-course outcome for such households, but
also an overall neighborhood effect beyond the impacts on indi-
vidual households. The increasing emphasis on geographically
dispersing housing-subsidy recipients is thus based on the assump-
tion that residence in concentrated poverty neighborhoods abets
socially dysfunctional behavior, or more simply, that poverty house-
holds will do better outside of poverty neighborhoods (19). The
evidence from an analysis of several studies supports the view that
overall, participating tenants do gain from the dispersed moves.
However, the gains seem to come not from the lower concentration
of poverty per se but from the ``structural advantages of the
suburban areas, such as schools, public services, and job accessi-
bility'' (13). Moreover, there is at least case-study evidence that the
suburbs may not be better locations for less educated job seekers
(20). The case study of Boston concludes that residential dispersal
also is unlikely to be an effective strategy for removing spatial
barriers to access to employment for low-income workers. In terms
of access to jobs, central cities still provide greater opportunities for
these workers.
Mobility, Poverty Dispersal, and Changing Neighborhoods
The concern with neighborhood effects on households crystal-
lized around the notion that concentrated poverty generates
negative social effects and thus that reducing concentrated
poverty, or dispersing concentrated poverty, would have positive
effects on both individuals and neighborhoods (21). Households
will gain from their improved neighborhoods, and fewer poor
people in a single neighborhood will increase the social status of
the neighborhood and, by extension, perhaps make that neigh-
borhood more attractive to potential in-movers. The ideas may
not yet have a solid theoretical basis (22), but they have led to
substantial investment in measuring such outcomes; in particu-
lar, three mobility programs have provided data to examine the
outcomes of actual movement through urban neighborhoods.
The mobility programs are, in turn, a reflection of the
changing notions of how to provide housing to low-income
households. Whereas once the focus was on providing specific
projects for low-income households in need of assisted housing,
now the emphasis is on giving low-income households a choice
within the residential fabric. Whereas once the aim was to
provide help at fixed locations, now the Housing Voucher
Program, the largest assisted housing program within HUD,
aims to help households access housing in the private housing
market. The Housing Choice Voucher program grew out of the
Experimental Housing Allowance studies of the 1970s and was
first initiated as the Section 8 Certificate program. In the 1980s,
the Housing Voucher Program was initiated, and the two
programs were merged as the Housing Choice Voucher program
in 1998.
The first of the evaluations of the effects of moving from a
high-poverty neighborhood arose out of litigation over discrim-
ination in the provision of public housing. The outcome of the
Gautreaux decision in 1976 was to provide a metropolitan-wide
mobility program in which Section 8 subsidies were provided to
On the one hand, several studies (15­17) emphasize the impact of macroeconomic
structural changes that have taken jobs away from the inner city and thus disadvantaged
inner-city minority residents. On the other hand, there are studies that argue that the
concentrations of poverty are the outcomes of historic patterns of discrimination, includ-
ing the intentional citing of public housing in inner-city areas (18).
Nationally, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has funded 1.26
million public housing units, 1.4 million units in assisted housing programs, and 1.5 million
households in the Housing Voucher Program (4).

public housing residents so that they could move from the inner
city of Chicago to suburban white communities. Studies of the
Gautreaux program provided some evidence that those who
moved to suburban communities were more likely to be em-
ployed (although the salaries were not necessarily higher) and
that suburban youth did better on several educational measures
(23, 24). Although these findings could not be considered
conclusive evidence in favor of such programs, they did offer
insights into the shape of a possibly successful program, one that
would require substantial additional housing services if the
program were to succeed. At least one of the problems in
assessing the Gautreaux program was the substantial dropout
rate from the program (23, 24).
A more recent program was focused on the redistribution of
low-income public housing residents in Minneapolis and pro-
vided some positive findings among the generally mixed out-
comes of the program (21). As part of a consent decree in
Minneapolis, a large public family complex in the inner city of
Minneapolis was demolished (25). The residents of that project
created a substantial number of relocated households. An
analysis of the data from the Hollman case suggests several
important findings for the study of how relocation from inner-
city minority neighborhoods will play out at the larger urban
scale. Not all residents of the projects that were demolished were
willing participants in the relocation project; Southeast Asian
households were much more resistant to forced relocation than
were African-American households. The study showed that
displaced families did not want to move far away from their
former homes and most wanted to stay in Minneapolis (21).
Those families who indicated a desire to leave the city preferred
to move only to the inner ring of suburbs directly north of the
city. Preferences for familiar neighborhoods were especially
strong among the project residents.
Special Mobility Program participants (a group specified in
the Hollman consent decree) were much more likely to move to
the suburbs, but the preference of most families (about half of
participants) was to stay within Minneapolis. Moving to places
near to their original location was an important outcome of the
intervention process. More than half of all participants (but 90%
of Southeast Asian participants) in the Special Mobility Program
stayed in the central city. For this group, neighborhood quality
did not change. Those families who moved out of central city
neighborhoods gained in quality of living.
Such pilot mobility projects called for more systematic eval-
uation, and the aim of the MTO program was to find out, in a
controlled experiment, what happens when very poor families
have the chance to move out of subsidized housing in the poorest
neighborhoods of large American cities (26). The program was
initiated in 1992 with a mandate from Congress to HUD to test
the usefulness of housing vouchers for generating moves away
from low-poverty areas and into integrated residential settings.
Five cities (Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New
York) were selected to participate in the program. MTO divided
voucher holders into three groups. The control group did not
receive a voucher and initially continued to live in public or
assisted housing. The Section 8 group received a voucher and
regular housing assistance counseling. The experimental group
received a voucher and special mobility counseling but was
required to move to a low-poverty neighborhood (10% pov-
erty, according to the 1990 Census).
The most recent summary report of the MTO project (26)
suggests that the program has had substantial effects on housing
and the neighborhood conditions of participants, especially on
perceptions of safety, but mixed effects for educational gains,
employment, earnings, and public assistance. Two studies in
progress provide analyses showing that experimental households
had gains in perceived safety of the neighborhood and that they
actually lived in safer neighborhoods (27, 28). But as we will see,
although there are sometimes gains for those who moved, in the
context of the whole sample, the results may not be quite so
positive. Ensuing mobility, after the initial move, reiterates the
great difficulty of intervening in the dynamic of household
relocation. As Tiebout (29) observed, households vote with their
feet, and decisions by governments are always embedded in the
dynamic demography of the city. Households move again after
their initial relocation, and those moves often undo the advan-
tages of the initial residential move.
The strong gains in self-reported safety and housing quality for
MTO and Section 8 movers must be offset with the mixed results
with respect to living in reduced-poverty neighborhoods. The
final report states that MTO experimental members did not, on
average, spend much time in census tracts with lower poverty
levels, although there are differences in the neighborhood
characteristics for the experimental group and the control group.
In addition, nearly half the MTO movers chose neighborhoods
that increased in poverty during the 1990s. Perhaps even more
telling, but consistent with our knowledge of mobility in general,
subsequent moves by the MTO group were often to neighbor-
hoods like the ones they came from and, in some cases, back to
their old neighborhoods. Once again, we can identify two forces
at work, the changing demography of the city (increases in
poverty in inner-city tracts as their demography changed), and
housing choices and preferences that favor known neighbor-
hoods where there are friends, family, and support relationships.
To reiterate, the preliminary analyses of the MTO programs have
neither focused in detail on the relocation behavior of households
over time nor examined the extent to which assisted households
have been able to access more integrated residential environments.§
Both questions are relevant in light of discussions about using
vouchers to improve neighborhood opportunities and, specifically,
the intent of the MTO program (following Gautreaux) to address
the residential segregation of minority households. Thus, the fol-
lowing analysis focuses on these questions: Are there long-term
gains from the MTO voucher program and especially increases in
levels of integration? The findings of this analysis reiterate (i) the
difficulty of intervening in the residential mobility process, (ii) the
tendency of households, all other things being equal, to move to
nearby neighborhoods, (iii) the constraints of moving to more
expensive neighborhoods for low-income households, and (iv) the
difficulty of creating greater residential integration through housing
vouchers.
Research Questions and Analysis
The current research is built around three questions: What are
the differences in access to low-poverty neighborhoods between
initial and long-term residential relocations for assisted and
unassisted households? What are the differences in accessing
more-integrated residential neighborhoods between initial and
long-term residential relocations for assisted and unassisted
households? How do households who did not receive assistance
fare in their housing-market decisions?
The Findings from Baltimore: Access to Low-Poverty Neighborhoods.
Experimental movers (MTO movers) in Baltimore made signif-
icant initial gains in entering lower-poverty neighborhoods in
their first lease-up¶ (Table 1). Of course, this outcome is to be
expected, because the program specifically required leasing in a
§The reports also have tended to aggregate data across the five cities rather than examining
individual metropolitan outcomes.
¶``Lease up'' is the terminology to describe the process of successfully using the housing
voucher to rent a housing unit and move. The program was initiated and the sample
selected in the period 1994­1997. To reiterate, there are three groups in the study:
experimental movers who are given a housing voucher and special counseling, regular
Section 8 movers who are given a housing voucher, and the baseline or control group who
are not provided with assistance.

low-poverty neighborhood. Whereas nearly all experimental
movers chose neighborhoods that were 20% poverty neigh-
borhoods, only 23% of the regular Section 8 movers did so. The
question that is central here is to what extent the experimental
and Section 8 movers sustained the original gains after subse-
quent moves. Households moved, and, of course, neighborhoods
change over time.
The outcomes at the current survey time (2002) are signifi-
cantly more mixed in terms of the poverty levels of the neigh-
borhoods in which the households live (Table 1). Several dif-
ferent comparisons are possible. The current distribution of the
experimental movers is somewhat like the current distribution
for the Section 8 movers; even so, the distributions are still
significantly different from one another on a Kolmogorov­
Smirnov two-sample test (P  0.01). That is, overall, experi-
mental movers have a higher probability of being in a lower-
poverty neighborhood than do regular Section 8 movers. When
we compare the distributions of the experimental movers in their
initial locations and their current locations, we find that the
distributions are significantly different from one another on both
2 and Kolmogorov­Smirnov tests (P  0.01) We can conclude
that although there are initial gains, those gains decline over
time. Both additional moves and the changing dynamics of
neighborhoods affect the ability to sustain the gains made
through the original move to lower-poverty neighborhoods. The
contribution of this analysis is to demonstrate that initial gains
are difficult to sustain. As I noted earlier, households do not stay
put. They move as their life-course needs change, and those
moves may not sustain the initial gains made by moves to
low-poverty neighborhoods.
An additional issue is that not all households are able to use
their vouchers and so do not move. A full test of the program
should set the gains for a subset of the sample moves in the
context of all households. Only 58% of all experimental house-
holds were able to lease up. Of those who were not able to use
the experimental voucher, a large number moved anyway. Reg-
ular Section 8 voucher holders, who were not constrained to
choose a low-poverty neighborhood, were more successful in
finding a unit. In Baltimore, 72% of the Section 8 group moved.
If we measure the success of the program by including house-
holds who were not able to use the experimental voucher and
compare their distribution with regular Section 8 voucher hold-
ers, the differences across the distributions are quite minor. That
is, the overall gains from the MTO program virtually disappear
(Table 2). There is no significant difference between the MTO
experimental sample of movers plus nonmovers and the control
sample, comprised of those who did not receive a voucher. There
is no significant difference between experimental movers plus
nonmovers and Section 8 movers plus nonmovers. In sum, the
special counseling and extra effort to aid experimental movers
did not produce gains for the group as a whole, over and above
the gains for those who did not receive special help. Interestingly,
there is a marginally significant difference (at the P  0.05 level)
between Section 8 movers and nonmovers and the control
sample. Clearly, there are differences between movers and
nonmovers as we would expect, but to truly evaluate the success
of the voucher program, it is essential to consider the total
outcome for those who were successful (in moving to a low-
poverty neighborhood) and those who were not. It is trouble-
some for a policy of poverty dispersal that, overall, the current
distribution of control households, who received neither vouch-
ers nor experimental help, is only marginally more likely to show
households in high-poverty neighborhoods than the aggregate of
experimental and control group movers.
The Findings from Baltimore: Access to Integrated Neighborhoods. An
implicit argument that grows out of the Gautreaux litigation was
that mobility would give minority families an opportunity to live
in less segregated neighborhoods; the idea was that requiring
families to move to low-poverty neighborhoods also would result
in desegregation. The title of the MTO program is, in fact,
``Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration Pro-
gram,'' emphasizing the link of providing support to increase
access to integrated housing. In general, as reported by the latest
MTO report, the program seems to have been only partially
successful in meeting this aim (26).
A specific analysis of the effects of moving on racial patterns
in Baltimore confirms the difficulty in using vouchers to increase
racial integration. Much of the difficulty is that initial moves to
more integrated settings are not sustained over time. Although
the moves to integrated, sometimes suburban, neighborhoods
seem to provide some evidence of more integrated settings for
those who could lease up, the patterns for the sample as a whole
are not different for experimental (MTO) and regular Section 8
movers. Moreover, although the patterns of the experimental
and Section 8 movers are visually different from the control
sample, they are not visually different from one another (Fig. 1).
As for the discussion of access to low-poverty neighborhoods, the
questions that are central to any conclusion about outcomes are
(i) whether there are distinct gains from the experimental
program (above those for regular Section 8 voucher holders),
and (ii) how do the gains for the MTO group compare with the
control group who did not receive help at all.
By evaluating the current patterns of residences for experi-
mental and Section 8 voucher holders (after any subsequent
moves after the initial lease-up), we can evaluate the outcomes
of the movement behaviors of the two groups. Experimental

households who were able to find a unit in a low-poverty
neighborhood are more dispersed and are somewhat more likely
to live in suburban integrated neighborhoods (Fig. 1). There are
significant numbers of MTO experimental movers in the western
suburbs of Baltimore County, and there are many experimental
voucher holders in the Baltimore City communities of Hamilton,
Morgan Heights, and Lauraville (in the northeast sections of the
city). Similar results are apparent in the report on the MTO
program from Abt Associates (26). Regular Section 8 moves also
are widely distributed in the western suburbs and in the northeast
sections of the city. Visually the patterns are quite similar.
Clearly, although the program had initial success, it is hard to
sustain the patterns of dispersal. Many more MTO households
are now located in Baltimore City at the end of the evaluation
period. We can infer a return to familiar neighborhoods in the
city.**
The total MTO sample was comprised of self-selected house-
holds who expressed a desire to move. Thus, it is not surprising
to find that members of the control group, who were not given
vouchers, also had significant mobility. In the five-city study, the
control group actually had higher mobility than did either the
experimental participants or the regular Section 8 participants
(26). Their geographic mobility also emphasizes the housing
opportunities available to all households, experimental and
nonexperimental. Although many households in the control
group moved nearby, some households also were able to move
to neighborhoods in the northeastern communities of Baltimore
City and to the suburbs (Fig. 1). Still, the patterns are visually
different from the experimental and Section 8 movers.
Table 3 shows that the initial moves of the MTO experimental
group did result in greater integration. The pattern for Section
8 movers shows less overall integration but still some gains in
living in less segregated settings. Examination of current resi-
dential locations for MTO movers, however, reveals that these
gains have been eroded (Table 3). There is no significant
difference between the current residence distribution for exper-
imental movers and Section 8 movers. Both 2 and Kolmogorov­
Smirnov two-sample tests failed to detect any difference between
the distributions of current residence locations for these groups.
That the Section 8 and MTO distributions are not statistically
different from each other suggests that, on the issue of racial
integration, we must treat the gains from the experimental
program with some caution. Although the distributions for
Section 8 movers and experimental movers are significantly
different from the control sample, overall the results reiterate
the difficulty of intervening in residential choice. Mobility
decisions are complex and are set within family, neighborhood,
and work contexts.
Even without vouchers and the special counseling of the MTO
program, the control-sample households moved away from
An interim analysis of the total MTO program suggested that MTO movers were staying in
their new communities (30).

SOCIAL SCIENCES SPECIAL FEATURE
housing projects in the inner city. Clearly, housing demolition in
the central city displaced some of these households, and in this
sense, they were forced movers. In the past decade, 1,000
public housing units have been removed in Baltimore, and some
of the residents in these projects were part of the control group.
Even so, insofar as many of them made choices that are not
dissimilar to the assisted households raises questions about the
policy effectiveness of the special subsidy MTO program.
Conclusion
Overall, it seems that the special MTO program, although
partially successful and clearly an indication of HUD's concern
to find mechanisms for diffusing the geographic concentration of
minorities, also is a telling indication of how difficult it is to
intervene in the complex process of housing choice. Income and
assets are critical and integral parts of the choice process, as are
neighborhood composition preferences. Simply providing a
housing voucher does not negate the powerful forces of concerns
with neighbors, friends, and access to work in the choice process.
Nor does it negate a tendency, as we know from a large body of
research on residential mobility, for households to move short
distances and often to neighborhoods with which they are
familiar. The evidence of return to known and familiar neigh-
borhoods is an indicator of the way in which housing choices are
embedded in the larger urban structure. There are data, too, that
nonmovers also make gains. Nonmovers with more time in the
community and the possibility of tapping into the opportunity
structure of the neighborhood are actually likely to have higher
employment rates than do movers (26). Perhaps unsurprisingly,
moving is not a simple solution to problems of poor families,
even though the overall picture suggests gains from movements
out of poverty areas.
To reiterate, the increasing emphasis on geographically dis-
persing housing-subsidy recipients is based on the assumption
that residence in concentrated poverty neighborhoods abets
socially dysfunctional behavior, or more simply, that poverty
households will do better outside of poverty neighborhoods.
Although the tentative evidence points in this direction (i.e.,
overall, participating tenants do gain from the dispersed moves),
the gains seem to come not from the lower concentration of
poverty per se but from the ``structural advantages of the
suburban areas, such as schools, public services, and job acces-
sibility'' (13). Clearly, neighborhood effects, to the extent they
exist, are complex and not easily transferred to in-movers. There
are real questions about whether we can see neighborhoods
themselves as socializing agents. Thus, the mere existence of a
dispersed pattern of assisted households will not guarantee
moves out of poverty or success in the labor market.
In the most recent presentation of the results from the five
sample cities, the review of the MTO program tends to be
favorable and positive. It is a natural response of the stakehold-
ers to find that, in general, the MTO treatment led to significant
differences in where families moved with the program vouchers
(ref. 26, p. 46). The conclusion that the differences had narrowed
only marginally over time may be an overly optimistic conclusion
based on the research in this paper. Although the mobility
patterns of the experimental families may have placed them in
significantly better environments than those of the control
group, the lack of differences between experimental and regular
Section 8 movers at their current locations raises questions about
the cost benefits of the intervention policy.
