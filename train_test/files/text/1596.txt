Trihalomethanes (THMs) can form as byproducts during drinking water disinfection, which is crucial for limiting human exposure to disease-causing
pathogens. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), recognizing both the importance of water disinfection for public health protection and
potential risks associated with THM exposure, developed disinfection byproduct rules with the parallel goals of ensuring safe drinking water and limiting
the levels of THMs in public water systems. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) THM blood data can be used as a
means for assessing US population exposures to THMs; biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) can provide human health risk-based context to those data.
In this paper, we examine the blood THM levels in the 1999­2004 NHANES data to (i) determine weighted population percentiles of blood THMs,
(ii) explore whether gender and/or age are associated with blood THM levels, (iii) determine whether temporal trends can be discerned over the 6-year
timeframe, and (iv) draw comparisons between population THM blood levels and BEs. A statistically significant decrease in blood chloroform levels was
observed across the 1999­2004 time period. Age-related differences in blood chloroform levels were not consistent and no gender-related differences in
blood chloroform levels were observed. The concentrations of all four THMs in the blood of US residents from the 2003 to 2004 NHANES dataset are
below BEs consistent with the current US EPA reference doses. For bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane, the measured median blood
concentrations in the United States are within the BEs for the 10À6 and 10À4 cancer risk range, whereas measured values for bromoform generally fall
below the 10À6 cancer risk range. These assessments indicate that general population blood concentrations of THMs are in a range considered to be a low
to medium priority for risk assessment follow-up, according to the guidelines for interpretation of biomonitoring data using BEs.

Introduction
Trihalomethanes (THMs, including chloroform, bromodi-
chloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform)
are short-lived chemicals to which there is widespread human
exposure. THMs are produced when chlorine-based chemi-
cals are used to disinfect public drinking water; the goal of
disinfection is to protect human health by reducing human
exposure to disease-causing pathogens. However, toxico-
logical studies have demonstrated the potential for adverse
health effects from THM exposure at elevated levels,
including toxicity to the liver and kidneys and carcinogenicity
under chronic bioassay conditions (USEPA, 2005, 2006c). In
addition, epidemiological studies have suggested potential
associations between exposure to THMs and adverse
reproductive outcomes (Bove et al., 2002; Windham et al.,
2003; Tardiff et al., 2006). Thus, the US Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA), recognizing both the impor-
tance of water disinfection for public health protection and
the potential risks associated with THM exposure, developed
Disinfection Byproduct Rules (USEPA, 2001, 2006a, b) with
the parallel goals of ensuring safe drinking water and limiting
the levels of THMs in public water systems.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
has released nationally representative data on blood levels of
THMs in the United States, collected during three sampling
periods (1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004) as part of
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) (CDC, 2003, 2005). The NHANES data can be
used as part of a population-based exposure assessment.
However, limited tools are available for linking the
biomonitoring exposure data to human health risk.

Various approaches have been used to attempt to interpret
the NHANES biomonitoring data in terms of human health.
One approach involves deriving correlations between the
biomonitoring levels and health effects from epidemiological
studies. These efforts have difficulty reconciling the transient
and variable nature of the short-lived biomarkers with
chronic effects/diseases (LaKind et al., 2008). Another
approach involves estimating the plausible distribution of
doses that would yield the resulting distribution of biomo-
nitoring data. The estimated doses can then be compared
with established exposure guidance values derived by
regulatory agencies, like the reference dose (RfD) established
by the USEPA (Tan et al., 2006, 2007). However, this
approach is complex, especially for compounds with short
half-lives, multiple routes of exposure, and intermittent
exposure patterns, and the inherent uncertainties of the
reverse dosimetry approach for short-lived compounds have
been noted (Sohn et al., 2004; Hays et al., 2007).
The concept of biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) was
introduced to provide a method for conducting a screening-
level human health risk evaluation of biomonitoring data
(Hays et al., 2007). BEs, developed to serve as an interpretive
and risk management tool, are concentrations or ranges of
concentrations of a chemical in a biological medium such as
blood or urine consistent with existing health-based exposure
guidelines like the RfD (Hays et al., 2007, 2008; LaKind
et al., 2008). BEs are screening tools for assessing whether
biomonitoring data indicate a large, small, or no margin of
safety compared with existing health-based exposure guide-
lines. In general, BEs are derived from chemical-specific
human or animal pharmacokinetic data in a manner that
reconstructs the risk assessment's underlying exposure
guidance values (e.g. RfDs, reference concentrations) on an
internal dose basis. Detailed guidelines for the derivation and
communication of BEs are available (Hays et al., 2008;
LaKind et al., 2008) and BEs have been developed for
THMs (Aylward et al., 2008).
In this paper, we examine the blood THM levels in the
1999­2004 NHANES data to (i) determine weighted
population percentiles of blood THMs for each sampling
period, (ii) explore whether gender and/or age are associated
with blood THM levels, (iii) determine whether temporal
trends can be discerned over the 6-year timeframe, and (iv)
draw comparisons between population THM blood levels
and health-based BEs for individual compounds as well as
mixtures.
Methods
Analysis of NHANES Blood Data
THM levels in blood were measured using solid-phase
microextraction coupled with gas chromatography and
high-resolution mass spectrometry (Bonin et al., 2005).
These blood THM data are available for the time periods
1999­2000 (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/
lab99_00.htm), 2001­2002 (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
about/major/nhanes/nhanes2001-2002/lab01_02.htm), and
2003­2004 (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/
nhanes2003-2004/lab03_04.htm). For each of the time
periods, percentiles for the sampled population were
computed using weights given by CDC (CDC, 2006). For
weighted quantiles, an R package called Hmisc that contains
a weighted quantile function was used (Harrell et al., 2008; R
Development Core Team, 2008). Confidence intervals for
quantiles were calculated using a weighted bootstrap method
described by Chamberlain and Imbens (2003). For examina-
tion of percentage non-detects for each of the sampling
periods, unweighted data were used. Data on individuals
aged 20­59 years were given by CDC, and percentiles for the
different age groups within the population were estimated.
Temporal trends for the three timeframes were assessed. The
hypothesis test used is based on finding the largest value of a
such that simultaneous confidence intervals with coverage
probability 1-a (based on asymptotic normal approximation
to the distribution of the median estimates) for the 3 year's
medians fail to overlap. Measurements below the limit of
detection (LOD) were assigned a value of the LOD/
ffiffiffi
2
p
. In
general, detection limits ranged from 0.2 to 2.4 pg/ml for all
three sampling periods. Throughout this paper, the units
for blood THMs are pg/ml, or parts per trillion (ppt). A
small number of participants within each sampling period
had levels of THMs that were above the calibration range
(1999­2000: chloroform at 455 and 1570 pg/ml; 2001­2002:
chloroform at 623, 693, and 22,000 pg/ml; 2003­2004:
bromoform at 310 pg/ml). These values were included in
the analyses.
Development of BEs for THMs
Detailed information on the method for deriving BEs for
THMs is given in Aylward et al. (2008). The BE derivation is
based on reproducing the existing cancer and non-cancer risk
assessments on an internal dose basis to derive estimates of
average blood concentrations consistent with external dose
benchmarks for cancer (risk-specific doses corresponding to
10À6 and 10À4 risk levels) and non-cancer (human-equivalent
point of departure and RfD). Each BE is derived through
consideration of the toxicological data underlying the
respective exposure guidance value, understanding of the
pharmacokinetics of THMs in humans, and application of
appropriate uncertainty factor components to the toxico-
logical point of departure. The BEs can be used as screening
tools to identify whether the measured population concen-
trations are in the region of low, medium, or high priority for
risk assessment follow-up (Hays et al., 2008; LaKind et al.,
2008). In accordance with the BE derivation and commu-
nication guidelines (Hays et al., 2008; LaKind et al., 2008),
biomarker concentrations below the BERfD

concentration consistent with the RfD) indicate ``low
priority'' for risk assessment follow-up, whereas concentra-
tions in excess of the BERfD
but below the BEPOD
(biomarker
concentration consistent with the human-equivalent point of
departure) indicate medium priority, and those in excess of
the BEPOD
indicate high priority for risk assessment follow-
up. For cancer endpoints, the corresponding regions of
priority are delineated by the BEs associated with the 10À6
and 10À4 risk levels. The BEs for the four THMs based on
the currently available exposure guidance values are sum-
marized in Table 1. If alternative risk assessments based on
different underlying toxicological or epidemiological data are
conducted, different evaluations of BE values would be
required. Details regarding the assumptions and approaches
used in their derivation, as well as detailed discussion
regarding their limitations and appropriate uses, are pre-
sented in Aylward et al. (2008).
Evaluation of THM Mixtures in Blood
Multiple THMs tend to be formed during water disinfection
and likely lead to simultaneous exposure to more than one
THM. Therefore, a mixtures risk assessment approach is
needed. Regulation of THMs in drinking water is based on a
sum of the concentrations of the four compounds; however,
the differing toxicological potencies among the four com-
pounds necessitates understanding which compounds
contribute to the mixture of THMs in blood. One approach
used for mixtures risk assessment in environmental settings
for non-cancer endpoints is the hazard index (HI) approach.
Briefly, the ratio of the measured dose of each compound
in a mixture to the chemical-specific reference value (RfD, for
example) is calculated, and these hazard quotients are
summed to obtain an HI for the suite of chemicals
considered. The current mixtures risk assessment paradigm
implies no excess risks when the HI is below 1. Such
an approach is most defensible when the chemicals of interest
have similar modes of action and target organ toxicities
(USEPA, 2007), and when non-additive interactions
among the chemicals of interest are neither known nor
suspected.
The BEs present an opportunity to attempt a similar
approach to the mixtures biomonitoring data available
in the NHANES data. For each individual in the NHANES
2003­2004 dataset, we calculate an HI as
follows:

As discussed in the text, the BE values are used to delineate concentration ranges corresponding to low, medium, or high priority for risk assessment follow-
up. The values presented here are 24-h average concentrations consistent with the exposure guidance values (reference doses or cancer risk-specific doses). Full
details on the derivation, limitations, and appropriate application of these BE values are presented in Aylward et al. (2008).

aFrom USEPA, 2008, further discussion is provided: ``ythe RfD for non-cancer effects is derived from the most sensitive endpoint in the most sensitive
species. The RfD is based on fatty cysts [sic] formation (fat accumulation) in the liver and elevation of SGPT in dogsy. Hepatic fat accumulation and
elevated SGPT [serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase] are considered early signs of impaired liver function resulting from chloroform-induced cytotoxicity.
This effect occurs at doses at or below those that cause increased labeling index, morphological changes, or cellular necrosis, so protection against this effect is
believed to protect against cytolethality and regenerative hyperplasia. Accordingly, the RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day presented in Section I.A.1 can be considered
protective against increased risk of cancer.''

Results
Weighted Population Percentiles of Blood THM Levels for
Each Sampling Period and Temporal Trends
Selected weighted population percentiles (pg/ml, 95% CIs)
for three NHANES sampling time periods are given in
Table 2. Median levels of chloroform show a statistically
significant decline from 1999­2000 to 2003­2004
(Po0.0002). Median levels of bromodichloromethane in-
creased across the first two sampling periods, but then
declined in 2003­2004 compared with the earliest data. An
overall decline in median dibromochloromethane levels was
found. Levels of bromoform seem to have first increased and
then declined.
Gender and Age Differences for Blood THM Levels within
Sampling Periods
Focusing on chloroform (which had the lowest percentage of
non-detects of the THMs across all three sampling periods;
Table 2), there are no consistent trends by age or between
men and women across the three sampling periods (Table 3).
The difference in median blood chloroform levels for both
men and women decreased considerably between 1999­2000
and 2003­2004 (Table 3). For 1999­2000, whereas the trend
seems to be one of decreasing concentration with increasing
age in aggregate, no consistent decrease by age group was
found when the sampled population was analyzed by gender
(data not shown).
Comparison of Blood THM Levels to BEs
To provide public health perspective on the blood THM
levels from the NHANES study, the most current data (the
2003­2004 sampling period) were compared with the BEs
developed for each of the four THMs. For chloroform, the
BE is based on a value derived for non-cancer effects that is
also considered to be protective for cancer (USEPA, 2008).
For the three other THMs, BEs are available for both non-
cancer and cancer endpoints. The 2003­2004 NHANES
median and 95th percentile blood THM values are compared
with their respective BEs in Table 4.
Median and 95th percentile chloroform levels are approxi-
mately 20 and 4 times lower, respectively, than the BERfD
.
Median and 95th percentile bromodichloromethane and
dibromochloromethane levels are both below the respective
non-cancer BERfD
but within the 10À4 to 10À6 range BE for
cancer. Median and 95th percentile bromoform levels are
below the non-cancer-based BE and below the cancer-based
BEs at the 10À6 level. Figure 1 (adapted from Aylward et al.,
2008) illustrates the measured NHANES data for bromodi-
chloromethane in the context of the estimated BEs based on
the cancer risk endpoint for this compound. In accordance
with recommendations presented in the guidelines for
communication using BEs (LaKind et al., 2008), regions of
low, medium, and high priority for risk assessment follow-up
are defined based on whether measured concentrations are
below the BERfD
and/or the 1 Â 10À6 risk level (low priority),
in the range of 1 Â 10À6 to 1 Â 10À4 risk (medium priority) or
in excess of 1 Â 10À4 risk (high priority). For bromodichlor-
omethane, the median and 95th percentile measured
concentrations in the NHANES 2003­2004 fall into the
``medium'' priority range. The measured concentrations of
all four THMs are below their respective BERfD
values,

solely on comparison to the non-cancer endpoints).
The non-cancer mixture assessment for the four THM
compounds using the additive HI approach for each
individual resulted in HIs below 1 at the median (0.2) and
95th percentile (0.8) of the population based on the
NHANES 2003­2004 dataset.
Discussion
The availability of nationally representative data on blood
THM levels in the United States over multiple years allows
for a first look at temporal, gender, and age trends for these
chemicals. In addition, with the use of BEs, public health
interpretation of these levels can be provided.
A statistically significant decrease in blood chloroform
levels was observed across the 1999­2004 time period. This
decrease in blood chloroform levels coincides with the
implementation of the Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection
Byproducts Rule, which required water systems to reduce the
annual average of total THM levels to less than 0.08 mg/l
(USEPA, 2001) from a previous limit of 0.1 mg/l. Large
surface water systems were required to comply with the Stage
1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule by
January 2002 (USEPA, 2001). This regulation was imple-
mented to reduce THM exposure and is likely to have
contributed to the desired effect. Indeed, we find decreasing
blood chloroform between 1999­2000, 2001­2002 and
2003­2004. Although the relationship between the Stage 1
Rule and decreasing levels of blood chloroform levels could
be a causal one, decreases in blood chloroform levels could
have resulted from differences in a variety of other factors
(e.g. changes in non-disinfected private well use, rate of
swimming, source water bromide levels) across the three
sampling periods.
Consistent declines were not observed for blood levels of
the other THMs, but the analyses were impeded by the fact
that levels were closer to or below limits of detection. For this
reason, we focused on chloroform in our analyses of age- and
gender-related trends. Age-related differences in blood
chloroform levels were not consistent. For example, median
levels generally decreased with increasing age group for
the 1999­2000 period, but this was not observed for the
2001­2002 data; there was a small, non-significant difference
in levels between youngest and oldest age groups in the
2003­2004 time period. We did not find gender-related dif-
ferences in blood chloroform levels for any of the time periods.
The derivation of BE values is one effort to provide
context and information useful for interpretation of

biomonitoring data; these values are not regulatory risk
assessments or determinations. The US blood THM levels
from the 2003­2004 dataset are below BEs consistent with
the current USEPA RfDs for these compounds, and indicate
levels between the 10À6 and 10À4 cancer risk range for
bromodichloromethane and bromodichloromethane (and
below the 10À6 risk level for bromoform). The non-cancer
mixture assessment for the four THM compounds using the
additive HI approach for each individual resulted in HIs
below 1 at the median and 95th percentile of the population
(HIs of 0.2 and 0.8, respectively) based on the NHANES
2003­2004 dataset. These assessments indicate that, based on
the NHANES 2003­2004 data and the BEs derived from
EPA guidance values, general population blood concentra-
tions of THMs are in a range that would be considered to be
a low to medium priority for risk assessment follow-up.
The statistical evaluation of biomonitoring data from
NHANES and the comparison of these data to BEs for the
THMs presented here must be considered in the context of
the characteristics of THM compounds. THMs are volatile
and are rapidly metabolized and eliminated from blood after
exposure. Exposures to THMs in water can occur from
consumption of water but also after inhalation or dermal
exposure during use of water for showering, cooking,
dishwashing, and other activities (Ashley et al., 2005). Such
exposures can result in rapid increases in blood concentration
followed by rapid declines (Ashley et al., 2005). Thus,
measurement of THM concentrations in blood at any given
time does not provide information for an individual
regarding either long-term or peak exposure levels. However,
the cross-sectional nature of the NHANES study does
provide a broad overview of the range of values likely to be
encountered in the general US population on a typical
ongoing basis.
The BEs used here to provide a screening level evaluation
of the NHANES data are based on time-weighted average
(not peak) daily blood concentrations consistent with the
current RfDs and cancer risk-specific values for the various
compounds (changes in those reference values would
necessitate reconsideration of the BEs). These BEs and their
underlying reference values are based on an assumption of
ongoing, lifetime exposures, and interpretation of cross-
sectional data (whether biomonitoring data or data on
concentrations in drinking water) must always be made with
this limitation in mind. In comparison, someone experiencing
a single, bolus, once per day exposure equivalent to an RfD
could experience a peak blood concentration of chloroform
approximately five times the 24-h theoretical average blood
concentration at that same exposure, which is the concentra-
tion reported as the BE. Thus, comparison of the cross-
sectional data with these BEs based on the lifetime exposure
assumption must be made cautiously, given both the inherent
within-day variability as well as the potential for variation
over longer time frames for these types of data. Comparison
of the NHANES data to the BEs provide a rational basis for
a screening-level assessment of the public health risks
indicated by these data, but results at the upper or lower
tails of the NHANES dataset distributions (which may
represent transient peak or minimum blood concentrations,
respectively) should be interpreted in comparison with the
BEs only with a great deal of caution.
The analytical sensitivity achieved in the NHANES
1999­2004 datasets was sufficient to allow detection of the
THM compounds in the majority of sampled individuals,
and so avoids the limitations of the earlier NHANES III
analyses (sampling conducted from 1988 to 1994; Ashley
et al., 1994). However, given the highly transient nature of
these compounds, public health interpretation of ongoing
exposures would be enhanced by the development of
biomarkers of THM exposures that have longer half-lives.
Such biomarkers might include urinary metabolites (if stable
and selective markers could be discovered) or protein adducts
resulting from the reaction of the THM compounds or their
metabolites with proteins in blood. Biomarkers that represent
more of an integrative measure of exposure would reduce
some of the issues with interpreting the tails of the current
THM in blood biomarkers.
The NHANES study design is a complex, multistage,
probability sample designed to represent the civilian, non-
institutionalized population and, as such, is not designed to
necessarily capture individuals who may be occupationally
exposed (e.g. people who work in recreational facilities with

Figure 1. Measured National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) blood concentrations (median, 95th percentile) in
the context of estimated biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) for
bromodichloromethane (BDCM) based on cancer risk-specific doses
at levels consistent with the 10À6 and the 10À4 risk-specific doses
(adapted from Aylward et al., 2008). The measured blood bromodi-
chloromethane concentrations fall within this range, indicating a
``medium'' priority for risk assessment follow-up in the framework
established in the BE guidelines for communication (LaKind et al.,
2008).

swimming pools or in water treatment facilities) or special
populations such as frequent or competitive swimmers. Thus,
conclusions drawn from examination of the NHANES blood
concentration data are limited to members of the typical
general population and may not apply to these special
population groups. Furthermore, studies that attempt to
measure potential peak levels of THMs in blood of
individuals experiencing temporary and intermittent activities
that might be associated with high THM exposures (taking a
shower and/or swimming in a chlorinated swimming pool)
should not be interpreted using the BERfD
as these BEs are
designed to be associated with interpreting steady-state life-
time average blood levels of THMs. Rather, the biomonitor-
ing levels associated with these types of intermittent and
temporary elevated exposures may be more appropriate to
interpret using a BE associated with an acute exposure
guidance value such as the acute duration minimal risk level
set by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
Such BEs would likely be several fold higher than the BEs
based on lifetime chronic RfD values.
The mixture evaluation presented here is drawn from
methods used in risk assessments for situations involving
exposure to multiple compounds. In the case of THM
compounds, the similarities in non-cancer response endpoints
across compounds (liver toxicity) supports, at least in theory,
consideration of the mixture using an HI approach, and
incorporates an assumption that the exposure levels encoun-
tered in the general population are not likely to approach
levels in which metabolic interactions and inhibition would
occur (Haddad et al., 2006). We recognize that this approach
has not been validated for assessments based on biomonitor-
ing data, but present this analysis as a potential application of
an existing risk assessment approach. Other approaches to
mixtures can be contemplated, and the BEs may be useful in
those approaches as well.
