Abstract
Sandhoff disease (SD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by a mutation in the gene for the
b-subunit of b-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Hex), resulting in the inability to catabolize ganglioside GM2 within the lysosomes.
SD presents with an accumulation of GM2 and its asialo derivative GA2, primarily in the central nervous system. Myelin-
enriched glycolipids, cerebrosides and sulfatides, are also decreased in SD corresponding with dysmyelination. At present, no
treatment exists for SD. Previous studies have shown the therapeutic benefit of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-
mediated gene therapy in the treatment of SD in murine and feline models. In this study, we treated presymptomatic SD
cats with AAVrh8 vectors expressing feline Hex in the thalamus combined with intracerebroventricular (Thal/ICV) injections.
Treated animals showed clearly improved neurologic function and quality of life, manifested in part by prevention or attenu-
ation of whole-body tremors characteristic of untreated animals. Hex activity was significantly elevated, whereas storage of
GM2 and GA2 was significantly decreased in tissue samples taken from the cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and cervical spinal
cord. Treatment also increased levels of myelin-enriched cerebrosides and sulfatides in the cortex and thalamus. This study
demonstrates the therapeutic potential of AAV for feline SD and suggests a similar potential for human SD patients.

Introduction
Sandhoff disease (SD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disorder caused by a deficiency of -N-acetylhexosamini-
dase (Hex, EC 3.2.1.52; Sandhoff et al., 1968). Hex com-
prises two subunits,  and , that dimerize to form separate
isozymes: HexA () and HexB (). Mutations in the gene
for the -subunit of Hex cause SD, leading to excessive
accumulation of the ganglioside GM2 and its asialo deriva-
tive GA2 within lysosomes (Gravel et al., 1995). Disease
onset ranges from infancy to adulthood and is marked by
progressive neurodegeneration, brain dysfunction, and
death. In addition to ganglioside accumulation, SD is also

characterized by a reduction in myelin-enriched glycolipids,
cerebrosides and sulfatides (Sandhoff et al., 1971; Denny
et al., 2006; Baek et al., 2008).
Although the cause of SD has been known for decades,
the disease remains incurable today. Several experimental
therapies have been examined for the treatment of SD
including bone marrow transplantation, stem cell therapy,
substrate reduction therapy, caloric restriction, enzyme
replacement therapy, and gene therapy (Rattazzi et al.,
1982; Norflus et al., 1998; Jeyakumar et al., 1999;
Cachon-Gonzalez et al., 2006; Denny et al., 2006; Lee
et al., 2007; Arthur et al., 2013; Bradbury et al., 2013).
Recent studies revealing the success of adeno-associated
virus (AAV) gene therapy in treating murine and feline
SD models demonstrate the potential for successful treat-
ment of human GM2 gangliosidosis (Sargeant et al., 2011;
Cachon-Gonzalez et al., 2012; Bradbury et al., 2013).
AAV gene therapy in SD mice resulted in survival to
2 years of age, compared with approximately four
months of age for untreated SD mice (Cachon-
Gonzalez et al., 2006, 2012), which prompted testing in
SD cats. The naturally occurring feline model of SD has
been maintained as a research colony and thoroughly
characterized for more than 35 years (Cork et al., 1977,
1978; Martin et al., 2004; Baek et al., 2009; Bradbury
et al., 2009). The cat brain is >50 times larger than a
mouse brain and is more complex. Also, human anatomy
and lipid profiles are more similar to cat than mouse; thus
the treatment of cats was chosen to act as a bridge
between mouse experiments and human clinical trials
(Baek et al., 2009; Bradbury et al., 2013).
After bilateral injection of the thalamus alone, SD cats
treated with AAV1 vectors expressing human Hex had
reduced GM2 ganglioside storage and an increased lifespan
(Bradbury et al., 2013). However, a pronounced humoral
immune response was detected in treated cats, and restor-
ation of Hex activity to the cerebellum was minimal. Second-
generation vectors incorporating the AAVrh8 capsid and
feline Hex led to improved longevity with minimal immune
response (Bradbury et al., 2013). Here, we optimize therapy
of the cerebellum and spinal cord by adding intracerebro-
ventricular (ICV) injection of AAVrh8 vectors to the thal-
amic delivery route proven effective at treating the
diencephalon. Also, we examine the lipid profiles of
AAVrh8-treated SD cats to better assess therapy distribu-
tion throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and feasi-
bility of this approach for human clinical application.
Materials and Methods
Animal Surgery and Treatment Groups
The breeding colony of SD cats was maintained at
Auburn University, AL. The institutional animal care
and use committee approved the research described
herein. Affected SD cats were treated at 1.1 to 1.6
months of age (disease onset, 1.3 Æ 0.2 months).
Anesthesia was induced with ketamine (10 mg/kg) and
dexmedotomidine (0.04 mg/kg) through an intravenous
catheter and maintained using isoflurane (0.5% to
1.5%) in oxygen delivered through an endotracheal
tube. Cats were positioned sternally for intracranial injec-
tion using a Horsley­Clark stereotaxic apparatus (David
Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and injected with vector
bilaterally in the thalamus and in the left lateral ventricle.
Craniotomy sites were made with a 20-gauge needle at the
following distances (in cm) from bony landmarks on the
skull:thalamus (relative to bregma), anterior-posterior
(AP)À0.65, mediolateral (ML) Æ0.4, dorsoventral (DV)
À1.6 (from meninges); left lateral ventricle, caudo-
thalamic notch located by ultrasound guidance through
the bregma or median suture after a 1.5-cm incision of the
scalp. Vector was delivered using a Hamilton syringe
(Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) with a noncoring
needle (22-25 G). A total of 70 ml was injected into
each thalamus in 10 to 20ml boluses. Injection rate was
2ml/min, and the needle was raised 0.15 cm between boluses.
A total of 200ml was injected into the left lateral ventricle at a
rate of 15ml/min. The total vector dose was 1.1Â 1012 vector
genomes, which comprise a 1:1 ratio of AAVrh8 vectors
expressing the feline Hex  or  subunit, described previously
(Bradbury et al., 2013). Vectors included the hybrid chicken
-actin promoter (Cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhan-
cer fused to the chicken -actin promoter; Matalon et al.,
2003) and woodchuck hepatitis posttranscriptional regula-
tory element (WPRE). AAV-treated cats (n¼ 4) were eutha-
nized 16 weeks postinjection for biochemical analysis of
therapeutic effect. Controls were age-matched untreated
normal cats (n¼ 4 for all analyses) and untreated SD cats
(n¼ 5 for enzyme analysis, n¼ 6­7 for storage analysis, and
n¼ 14 for clinical analysis). Disease progression was scored
on a 10-point scale based on gait defects, compiled from
untreated SD cats over the last 5 years. Cats received the
following scores based on gait. Age of onset Æ standard
deviation are shown in parentheses: 10, normal
(<1.3 Æ 0.2 mos.); 9, hind limb muscle weakness
(2.1 Æ 0.0); 8, wide stance (2.2Æ 0.4 mos.); 7, ataxia
(2.5 Æ 0.3 mos.); 6, instability with occasional falling
(2.9 Æ 0.5 mos.); 5, limited walking (3.5 Æ 0.5 mos.); 4,
able to stand but not walk (3.9 Æ 0.5 mos.); 3, cannot
stand on 2 consecutive days (humane endpoint, 4.4 Æ 0.6
months for untreated SD cats, n ¼ 14); 2, lateral recum-
bency; 1, progressive disease. Also, tremor progression
was noted as no tremors, fine tremors, whole-body tremors,
hind limb spasticity, or fore limb spasticity.
Tissue Preparation
Brains were divided into coronal blocks of 0.6 cm from
the frontal pole through the cerebellum. Coronal blocks
2 ASN Neuro
from the right hemisphere were frozen in optimum
cutting temperature (OCT) medium and used for analysis
of Hex distribution by naphthol staining and Hex-specific
activity by 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) enzyme assays.
Coronal blocks from the left hemisphere were halved to
0.3 cm and fixed in 10% formalin or stored at À80C for
analysis of storage material by high-performance thin
layer chromatography (HPTLC).
Lipid Extraction for HPTLC
CNS tissue was homogenized in 3 ml dH2
O. An aliquot
(100 ml) of each homogenate was set aside for analysis of
Hex activity. The remaining homogenate was frozen at
À80C and lyophilized. The weight of the lyophilized
tissue was measured prior to lipid extraction.
Lyophilized tissues were transferred into 50 ml
glass screw capped test tubes and rehydrated with
0.5 ml of dH2
O. Lipids were extracted from the tissue
by adding 5 ml CHCl3
: CH3
OH 1:1 (v/v). A small mag-
netic stirring bar was added, and samples were placed on
a magnetic stirrer at room temperature overnight
(Seyfried et al., 1978; Hauser et al., 2004). Samples were
spun at 1200 Âg for 20 min, and the supernatant was col-
lected. Two milliliters of CHCl3
: CH3
OH 1:1 (v/v) were
added to the pellets prior to spinning a second time. The
second supernatant was collected and added to the first;
2.5 ml of chloroform, 8.5 ml of methanol, and 1.6 ml
dH2
0 were added to the supernatant creating a final
ratio of 30:60:8 CHCl3
: CH3
OH: dH2
O (v/v/v) (Baek
et al., 2010).
Column Chromatography
Ion exchange chromatography was performed to separate
neutral lipids and cholesterol from acidic lipids and gan-
gliosides as previously reported (Macala et al., 1983; Baek
et al., 2009). Total lipid extract was applied to a column
containing DEAE sephadex (A-25, GE Healthcare). The
column was washed twice with 20ml of solvent A, CHCl3
:
CH3
OH: dH2
O 30:60:8 (v/v/v), and the entire neutral lipid
fraction consisting of the initial eluent plus washes was
collected. This fraction contained the cholesterol, phos-
phatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, plasmalogens,
sphingomyelin, cerebrosides, and asialo-GM2 (GA2). The
column was then washed with 30ml of solvent B, CHCl3
:
CH3
OH: 0.8 M NaOAc 30:60:8 (v/v/v) in order to elute
and collect acidic lipids and gangliosides.
Neutral Lipid Purification
Neutral lipids were dried by rotary evaporation and
resuspended in 10 ml CHCl3
:CH3
OH 1:1 (v/v). To further
purify GA2, a 4 ml aliquot of neutral lipids was dried
under nitrogen and then base treated with 1 ml of 1 N
NaOH at 37C for 1.5 hr. The sample was Folch parti-
tioned as previously described (Kasperzyk et al., 2004).
The lower phase containing GA2 and cerebrosides was
evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in 4 ml
CHCl3
:CH3
OH 1:1 (v/v) (Baek et al., 2009).
Ganglioside and Acidic Phospholipid Purification
The acidic lipid fraction containing gangliosides was dried
by rotary evaporation and separated into acidic lipids and
gangliosides by Folch partitioning as described previously
(Folch et al., 1957; Seyfried et al., 1978; Kasperzyk et al.,
2005). After the upper aqueous phase containing ganglio-
sides was transferred, the lower organic phase containing
the acidic lipids was dried under nitrogen and resuspended
in 10ml CHCl3
:CH3
OH 1:1 (v/v). This fraction contained
fatty acids, cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidyli-
nositol, and sulfatides.
Resorcinol Assay
An aliquot of the upper aqueous phase containing
gangliosides was evaporated and analyzed for sialic acid
content using a resorcinol assay as previously described
(Svennerholm, 1957; Hauser et al., 2004; Kasperzyk et al.,
2004). N-acetylneuraminic acid was used as an external
standard. Samples were dissolved in 1 ml of resorcinol
reagent (40 ml concentrated HCl, 0.125 ml 0.1 M copper
sulfate, 5 ml 2% resorcinol stock, brought up to 50 ml
with dH2
O): dH2
O 1:1 (v/v). Samples were then boiled
for 17 min and cooled in an ice bath; 1.5 ml of butyl acet-
ate: 1-butanol 85:15 (v/v) was added to each sample.
Samples were vortexed and then centrifuged at 1200 Âg
for 1 min. The violet supernatant was removed and ana-
lyzed at 580 nm in crystal cuvettes in the Shimadzu UV-
1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan).
Base Treatment and Desalting
The remaining gangliosides were evaporated under
nitrogen. Dried gangliosides were base treated with 1 ml
of 1 N NaOH at 37C for 1.5 hr. Salts were removed from
gangliosides using a C18 reverse-phase Bond Elute
column as previously described (Hauser et al., 2004;
Kasperzyk et al., 2004; Baek et al., 2010). The samples
were applied to columns that were previously equilibrated
with 5 ml each of: CHCl3
:CH3
OH 1:1 (v/v), CH3
OH, and
0.1 M NaCl. The columns were washed slowly with 20 ml
dH2
0 to remove salts. Gangliosides were eluted from the
columns using 4 ml CH3
OH followed by 3 ml
CHCl3
:CH3
OH 1:1 (v/v) and then dried under nitrogen.
Gangliosides were resuspended in 5 ml CHCl3
: CH3
OH
2:1 (v/v), and an aliquot was analyzed for sialic acid
content.

Lipid Analysis by HPTLC
All lipids were evaluated qualitatively with HPTLC. Each
lane was spotted with 1.5 mg sialic acid for gangliosides,
70 mg of dry weight for neutral lipids, and 200 mg of dry
weight for acidic lipids and GA2. Purified lipid standards
were purchased from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA)
or were a gift from Dr. Robert Yu (Medical College of
Georgia, August, GA). To enhance precision, oleoyl alco-
hol was added as an internal standard to the neutral and
acidic lipid standards and samples. Lipids were spotted
on 10 Â 20 cm Silica gel HPTLC plates using a Camag
Linomat V semiautomatic TLC spotter (Camag Scientific
Inc., Wilmington, NC). Gangliosides were developed in a
single ascending run for 90 min in CHCl3
: CH3
OH: dH2
O
55:45:10 (v/v/v) containing 0.02% CaCl2
(aq). Plates were
sprayed with resorcinol-HCl reagent and heated at 95C
face down for 10 min and then face up for an additional
minute in order to visualize gangliosides (Ando et al.,
1978; Seyfried et al., 1978). GA2 was developed to the
top in a single ascending run in CHCl3
:CH3
OH:dH2
O
65:35:8 (v/v/v) containing 0.22% CaCl2
(aq). Plates
were sprayed with orcinol-H2
SO4
and heated at 95C
face up for 5 min to visualize GA2 (Svennerholm,
1957). Neutral and acidic lipid HPTLC plates were devel-
oped to a height of 4.5 or 6 cm, respectively, in
CHCl3
:CH3
OH: CH3
COOH:HCOOH:dH2
O 35:15:6:2:1
(v/v/v/v/v). Plates were dried and then developed to the
top in C6
H14
:C6
H14
O:CH3
COOH 65:35:2 (v/v/v). Lipid
bands were visualized by charring with 3% cupric acetate
in 8% phosphoric acid solution for 7 min as previously
described (Seyfried et al., 1984; Kasperzyk et al., 2004).
Quantitation of Individual Lipids
The quantitation of individual lipids was performed as
previously described (Arthur et al., 2013). Total brain
ganglioside distribution was normalized to 100%, and
the percentage distribution was used to calculate sialic
acid concentration of GM2. To calculate neutral lipids,
acidic lipids and GA2 density values were fit to a stand-
ard curve of known standard.
Determination of Lysosomal Enzyme Activity and
Distribution
Total Hex activity from samples homogenized for HPTLC
was determined as previously described using the synthetic
fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl--D-
glucosaminide (MUG; Hauser et al., 2004). For enzyme
assays on blocks A­O, several frozen sections (50 mm) were
cut from each coronal block, and lysosomal enzyme activ-
ity was measured as previously described using synthetic
4-methylumbelliferyl (4MU) fluorogenic substrates
(Bradbury et al., 2009): HexA, 4MU-6-sulfo-2-
acetamido-2-deoxy--D-glucopyranoside (MUGS); total
Hex, MUG; -mannosidase, 4MU--D-manopyranoside.
Specific activity was expressed as nmol 4MU/mg protein/
hr. Histochemical staining for total Hex activity was
performed on 40 mm frozen sections using 0.25 mM naph-
thol AS-BI-N-acetyl-B-D-glucosaminide in the presence
of pararosaniline as previously described (Lacorazza and
Jendoubi, 1995).
Statistics
HPTLC and corresponding MUG data were analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to calculate
statistical significance between groups using IMB SPSS
Statistics 21 software. For pairwise comparisons of lyso-
somal enzyme activity, statistics were performed in SAS
9.2 software using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. One-sided
testing is reported for directional significance (i.e., signifi-
cantly higher or lower), which may otherwise not be rea-
lized using two-sided testing due to low animal numbers
when using a feline model.
Results
Our objective was to determine the degree to which
AAVrh8 vectors expressing feline Hex  and  subunits
could correct the biochemical and behavioral symptoms
of ganglioside GM2 storage in SD cats when injected into
the thalamus combined with intracerebroventricular
(Thal/ICV) injections (Bradbury et al., 2013). Clinical
disease progression was monitored in animals using a
10-point scoring system based on gait defects in untreated
animals (see ``Materials and Methods'' section for
description). Untreated animals experienced hind limb
muscle weakness, ataxia, and whole-body tremors by
2.5 (Æ 0.3) months and progressed to humane end
point, defined by inability to stand and a clinical rating
score of 3, by 4.4 (Æ 0.6) months (n ¼ 14). Disease pro-
gression was delayed in treated animals. At the predeter-
mined end point of 16 weeks posttreatment
(approximately five months of age), treated animals
received an average score of 6.8 (Æ0.6) with some animals
experiencing mild whole-body tremors while others
experienced only fine tremors (Figure 1; Supplemental
videos 1 and 2).
To determine Hex distribution from the injection site
to other regions of the brain, naphthol staining and
enzyme assays (MUG and MUGS) were performed for
each coronal block and each region of the CNS examined
by HPTLC (Figure 2(a)). Histochemical naphthol stain-
ing revealed widespread distribution of Hex throughout
the brain and spinal cord of treated animals (Figure 2(b)
and (c)).
The synthetic substrates MUGS (-subunit preferred)
and MUG (for total Hex activity) were used to quantify
4 ASN Neuro
Hex activity in the CNS, which in untreated SD cats was
2% of normal. In AAV-treated SD cats, total Hex
activity in brain averaged 3.7 - to 56.6-fold greater in
the treated cats than in normal cats, whereas activity in
spinal cord was 6.1 - to 16.4-fold greater in treated cats
than in normal cats (Table 1). The greatest activity was
found in block D, which contains the thalamic injection
site. Similar elevations above normal were measured
using MUGS substrate (Table 1). Total Hex activity
was additionally measured in each brain punch biopsy
used for HPTLC analysis and ranged from 2 - to 234-
fold normal in the AAV-treated cats (Table 2). Of the
sites biopsied for HPTLC, enzyme activity was highest
in the thalamic injection site and in the cervical intumes-
cence of the spinal cord.
Thal/ICV AAV treatment reduced total ganglioside
content by 96%, 89%, 87%, and 95% in cortex, cerebel-
lum, thalamus, and spinal cord regions, respectively, to
levels comparable with those found in normal animals
(Table 2).
GM2 accounted for approximately 40% of the total
ganglioside in the various CNS regions of untreated cats.
Treatment with Thal/ICV AAV injections resulted in a
!92% decrease of GM2 storage in all CNS regions tested
with a 98% decrease in the thalamus (Figure 3).
Correction of GM2 storage varied for each animal
tested as well as between regions for each individual
cat. In some animals, AAV treatment decreased GM2
concentration to below detectable levels, as in the
normal cats.
Similar reductions were documented in the levels of
asialo GM2 (GA2) in AAV-treated cats. GA2 was
undetectable in the CNS regions examined in normal
cats but was a major storage material in SD cats. AAV
treatment reduced GA2 to undetectable levels in the
thalamus and cervical intumescence of all SD cats
(Table 2), while average reduction was $ 97% in the
cortex and cerebellum biopsy sites. Two Thal/ICV treated
animals had no detectable GA2 accumulation in any of
the regions tested (data not shown for individual animals)
while the remaining cats varied in the amount of correc-
tion in each region.
The concentration of cerebrosides and sulfatides was
significantly lower in the brain regions of untreated
SD cats compared with normal cats (Table 2, Figures 4
and 5). This is consistent with previous reports of lower
Figure 1. Clinical progression of AAV-treated Sandhoff cats. SD cats from 1 to approximately 5.5 months of age were assigned numerical
scores corresponding to discrete stages of clinical disease progression, as defined in the ``Materials and Methods'' section. Shown are
clinical rating scores of four AAV-treated SD cats (7-957, 7-960, 11-972, 7-981) and mean scores for 14 untreated SD cats (SD no tx). The
humane endpoint is triggered by a score of 3, which occurs in untreated SD cats at 4.4 Æ 0.6 months of age. Treated cats survived in good
condition to the predetermined experimental endpoint of approximately 5.5 months of age. Shading of individual symbols represents
tremor severity as follows: no shading, no tremor; gray shading, fine tremors; black shading, mild whole-body tremors. Untreated SD cats
developed fine tremors at 1.3 (Æ0.2) months of age and whole-body tremors at 2.4 (Æ 0.1) months of age. The mean clinical rating scores
and standard deviations for treated cats at each age are as follows: 1 mo, 10 Æ 0.0; 2 mo, 9.9 Æ 0.3; 2.5 mo, 9.9 Æ 0.3; 3 mo, 9.9 Æ 0.3; 3.5 mo,
8.8 Æ 0.6; 4 mo, 8.1 Æ 1.0; 4.5 mo, 7.1 Æ 0.5; 5 mo, 6.8 Æ 0.6; 5.5 mo, 6.8 Æ 0.6. Supplemental videos 1 and 2 depict representative untreated
and AAV-treated SD cats, respectively. AAV ¼ adeno-associated virus; SD ¼ Sandhoff disease.

myelin-enriched glycolipids in SD mice, cats, and humans
(Sandhoff et al., 1971; Baek et al., 2009). Treatment nor-
malized the level of cerebrosides and partially restored
sulfatides in the thalamus but was insufficient to restore
normal levels of these myelin-associated lipids in the
cortex or cerebellum (Table 2). No differences were
found for the concentration of cerebrosides or sulfatides
in the cervical spinal cord between normal and SD cats
regardless of treatment. However, unusually high
variability in all cohorts may have contributed to incon-
clusive findings from this region.
Elevation of nonmutant lysosomal hydrolases often
occurs in lysosomal storage diseases (McCurdy et al.,
2014). CNS -mannosidase activity was 5.6 - to 11.3-
fold higher in untreated SD cats than in normal cats
(p ¼ 0.01 for each block; Figure 6). AAV treatment sig-
nificantly decreased mannosidase activity in all CNS
regions, though levels remained significantly above
normal in three of eight brain regions and six of seven
spinal cord blocks.
Discussion
No effective treatments presently exist for persons with
SD. Recent studies in murine and feline models have
shown the potential for AAV treatment in the manage-
ment of ganglioside storage diseases (Cachon-Gonzalez
et al., 2006; Broekman et al., 2007; Baek et al., 2010;
Sargeant et al., 2011; Cachon-Gonzalez et al., 2012;
Bradbury et al., 2013; McCurdy et al., 2014). Here, we
examined the effects of thalamic injections, in combin-
ation with ICV injection, on disease progression of SD
cats using AAVrh8 vectors expressing feline Hex  and .
Hex activity and lipid concentrations were evaluated in
Figure 2. Therapeutic enzyme distribution in the CNS of Sandhoff cats after AAV treatment. SD cats were injected bilaterally in the
thalamus and the left lateral ventricle with AAVrh8-fHEXA and AAVrh8-fHEXB (1.1 Â 1012 vector genomes total), and tissues were
collected 16 weeks later. (a) Shown are injection sites (white circles) and 0.6 cm coronal blocks of the brain (A­H) and spinal cord (I­
O) collected at necropsy. Blocks were halved and analyzed for enzyme activity (right) or for storage material (left; black circles show biopsy
sites for HPTLC). Lysosomal Hex activity (red) detected with naphthol substrate at acidic pH was visualized throughout the brain (b) and
spinal cord (c) of a representative, treated SD cat (SDþAAV; 7-960). Corresponding Hex activity against MUGS substrate is shown below
each block as fold normal level (fold N). Representative control sections are shown from untreated normal cats along with untreated SD
cats, which express 0.02 fold normal Hex activity in the brain and spinal cord. The range of specific activities for normal control blocks
were brain, 28.1 (G) ­ 57.4 (D); spinal cord, 8.3 (M) ­ 17.3 (K) nmol 4MU/mg/hr. AAV ¼ adeno-associated virus; SD ¼ Sandhoff disease.

different regions of the SD cat CNS. Previous studies
showed that axonal transport could facilitate delivery of
lysosomal enzymes throughout the CNS (Passini et al.,
2002; Broekman et al., 2009). The highly interconnected
thalamus was chosen as the site for AAV injection to
maximize the distribution of Hex from vector-transduced
cells (Baek et al., 2010; Baxter, 2013; Constantinople and
Bruno, 2013). However, previous work (Bradbury et al.,
2013) demonstrated that thalamic injection alone was not
sufficient to restore Hex activity to the cerebellum.
Because of the vascularity of the posterior fossa and the
surgical risk associated with direct injection of the cere-
bellum, we selected ICV injections for cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF)-based treatment of the cerebellum, and potentially
the spinal cord. Enzyme activity in all regions of the trea-
ted CNS was significantly increased compared with both
untreated SD animals and normal animals, and Hex
reached 5 - to 7-fold normal in the cerebellum compared
with a maximum of 0.4-fold normal in animals treated by
thalamic injection only (Bradbury et al., 2013). Inclusion
of ICV injection or a similar route is required for effective
treatment of the cerebellum. The highest level of enzym-
atic activity occurred in the thalamic injection site, where
Hex activity was 234-fold above normal. While other
studies using AAVs have reported brain toxicity caused
by overexpression of proteins (Georgievska et al., 2002;
Klein et al., 2006), our previous study using this vector
found no evidence of neuron loss or clinical neurological
symptoms in normal cats >1.5 years postinjection indi-
cating no brain toxicity as a result of AAV-mediated
overexpression of Hex (Bradbury et al., 2013). For this
reason, we do not believe that the high levels of enzyme
cause pervasive cytotoxicity in the cat CNS.
In addition to axonal transport of Hex to areas of the
CNS remote from the injection site, the therapeutic mech-
anism in our study is likely to involve transmission of the
vector and enzyme through the perivascular space of
Virchow­Robin (Broekman et al., 2009; Cachon-
Gonzalez et al., 2012). Also, it is known that AAV vec-
tors transduce ependymal cells (Yamazaki et al., 2014;
Yang et al., 2014) and that lysosomal enzyme is distrib-
uted throughout the brain parenchyma after CSF-
mediated delivery of AAV (Liu et al., 2005; Haurigot
et al., 2013). However, because cats in the current study
were treated by both CSF and thalamic injection, we
cannot strictly determine the contribution of each indi-
vidual route to Hex activity in the brain parenchyma.
The storage of GM2 and GA2 in SD causes lysosomal
and neuronal swelling (Cork et al., 1977, 1978), cellular
apoptosis, and CNS inflammation (Huang et al., 1997;
Jeyakumar et al., 2003; Sargeant et al., 2011). To prevent
pathology, SD treatment should ultimately correct the

underlying defect by decreasing lipid storage in lysosomes.
Treatment with AAV decreased GM2 storage, as well as
GA2 storage, by greater than 92% in all regions tested.
Though ganglioside levels in SD cats after treatment were
not statistically different from normal, slight elevations may
have been caused by uneven Hex distribution, so that not all
cells had sufficient activity for complete clearance of storage
material. As seen in Figure 2, our treatment approach gen-
erated regions of intense activity that tapered to much lower
levels within the same coronal section. Nevertheless, neur-
onal morphology was normalized almost completely
throughout the brain (data not shown). Discrete areas of
persistent neuropathology were thought to coincide with
areas that received the lowest levels of Hex activity. Rare
areas of perivascular cuffing and cellular infiltrate were pre-
sent in the cerebral cortex of treated SD cats but were much
less pervasive than in our previous study in which mouse
Hex was used for treatment (Bradbury et al., 2013).
Although gangliosides are mostly stored in CNS gray
matter, histopathologic changes have been seen in white
matter of mice, cats, and humans with SD (Koelfen et al.,
1994; Kroll et al., 1995; Baek et al., 2009). The myelin-
associated lipids, cerebrosides and sulfatides, are also
decreased in mice, cats, and humans with SD (Sandhoff
et al., 1971; Baek et al., 2009), suggesting that
dysmyelination contributes to SD pathogenesis (Kroll
et al., 1995). Our results showed that AAV treatment
fully or partially restored the level of cerebrosides and
sulfatides in the thalamus. The lack of correction in the
cortex and cerebellum despite reduced ganglioside storage
requires further investigation but may improve at time
points beyond 16 weeks postinjection. If cerebroside/sulfa-
tide defects persist with time, it is possible that uneven Hex
distribution in the brain prevents full correction of the
disease phenotype in all cells. Alternatively, strong evi-
dence has been reported that an early myelin defect in
SD mice is refractory to standard gene therapy (Cachon-
Gonzalez et al., 2014), which could explain the lack of
cerebroside/sulfatide restoration distal to the injection
site in the current study. Focal rather than global normal-
ization of myelin defects may be responsible for the incom-
plete arrest of disease progression, though the disease
phenotype was dramatically improved by treatment.
The differences we found for total ganglioside concen-
tration between the various regions of the untreated cat
brain are consistent with observations from previous stu-
dies (Ueno et al., 1978; Byrne and Ledeen, 1983; Baek
et al., 2008) and from human SD patients (Baek et al.,
2009). Regardless of the concentration of storage material
across different sample locations of untreated animals,

total ganglioside content was significantly reduced in all
CNS regions after AAV treatment. When individual gan-
gliosides GM2 and GA2 were quantified, some variability
was noted between treated animals, though significant cor-
rection was seen in each region, and every animal had
substantial clearance of ganglioside.
Our study shows the effectiveness of AAV gene ther-
apy in restoring Hex activity to normal or above-normal
levels and attenuating the major lipid abnormalities in SD
cats. While the initial findings are unusually promising
for a large animal model of lysosomal disease, further
studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of
the treatment. Examination of clinical effect, enzyme
activity, and lipid concentrations of animals that are fol-
lowed long-term will allow us to better assess the poten-
tial for translation into human treatment.
