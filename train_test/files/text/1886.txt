Prevalence of the Metabolic Syndrome
Defined by the International Diabetes
Federation Among Adults in the U.S.
EARL S. FORD, MD, MPH
OBJECTIVE -- The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has proposed a new definition of
the metabolic syndrome that emphasizes central adiposity as determined by ethnic group­
specific thresholds of waist circumference. The objective of this study was to estimate the
prevalence of this syndrome using the IDF definition among U.S. adults and to compare it with
the prevalence estimated using the definition of the National Cholesterol Education Program
(NCEP).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 3,601 men and women aged 20
years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2002 were included in
the analyses.
RESULTS -- Based on the NCEP definition, the unadjusted prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome was 34.5  0.9% (percent  SE) among all participants, 33.7  1.6% among men, and
35.4  1.2% among women. Based on the IDF definition, the unadjusted prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome was 39.0  1.1% among all participants, 39.9  1.7% among men, and
38.1  1.2% among women. The IDF definition led to higher estimates of prevalence in all of the
demographic groups, especially among Mexican-American men. The two definitions similarly
classified 93% of the participants as having or not having the metabolic syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS -- In the U.S., the use of the IDF definition of the metabolic syndrome
leads to a higher prevalence estimate of the metabolic syndrome than the estimate based on the
NCEP definition.

In 1998, the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) was the first organization
to provide a definition of the metabolic
syndrome (1). In response, the European
Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance
countered with a modification of the
WHO definition (2). In 2001, the Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program
(NCEP) released its definition (3). Subse-
quently, the American Association of
Clinical Endocrinologists offered its views
regarding the definition of the metabolic
syndrome (4). The proliferation of defini-
tions suggested that a single unifying def-
inition was desirable (5). In the hope of
accomplishing this, the International Di-
abetes Federation (IDF) proposed a new
definition of the metabolic syndrome in
April 2005 (6).
The main focus in this new definition
is central obesity. To have the metabolic
syndrome, a person must have central ad-
iposity defined on the basis of waist cir-
cumference and two or more of the
following four factors: elevated concen-
trations of triglycerides, reduced concen-
trations of HDL cholesterol, elevated
blood pressure, and dysglycemia.
This new definition requires a fresh
assessment of the prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome as well as of the magni-
tude of the morbidity and mortality
associated with the metabolic syndrome.
The objectives of this article were 1) to
estimate the prevalence of the metabolic
syndrome using the new IDF definition
among U.S. adults, 2) to compare the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
with that based on the NCEP definition,
and 3) to examine the concordance of the
two definitions.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- In the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2002, the sample was
recruited using a multistage, stratified
sampling design. The survey was specifi-
cally designed to produce results that are
representative of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized U.S. population. The partici-
pants were interviewed at home and were
invited to attend the mobile examination
center, where they were asked to com-
plete additional questionnaires, to un-
dergo various examinations, and to
provide a blood sample. Details about the
survey may be found elsewhere (7).
According to the IDF definition,
someone has the metabolic syndrome if
he or she has central adiposity plus two or
more of the following four factors (6): 1)
raised concentration of triglycerides:
150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l) or specific
treatment for this lipid abnormality; 2) re-
duced concentration of HDL cholesterol:
40 mg/dl (1.03 mmol/l) in men and
50 mg/dl (1.29 mmol/l) in women or
specific treatment for this lipid abnormal-
ity; 3) raised blood pressure: systolic
blood pressure 130 mmHg or diastolic
blood pressure 85 mmHg or treatment
of previously diagnosed hypertension;
and 4) raised fasting plasma glucose con-
centration 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) or
previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
The IDF lists the following ethnic
group­specific thresholds for waist cir-
cumference to define central adiposity:
Europid, sub-Saharan African men, and
Eastern- and Middle-Eastern men, 94
cm; South Asian, Chinese, and ethnic
South- and Central-American men, 90
cm; Japanese men, 85 cm; women ex-

cept Japanese women, 80 cm; and Jap-
anese women, 90 cm. In this analysis,
the following thresholds for waist circum-
ference were used: white men, 94 cm;
African-American men, 94 cm; Mexi-
can-American men, 90 cm; white
women, 80 cm; African-American
women, 80 cm; and Mexican-American
women, 80 cm. For participants whose
designation was "other race­including
multiracial," thresholds that were once
based on Europid cut points (94 cm for
men and 80 cm for women) and once
based on South Asian cut points (90 cm
for men and 80 cm for women) were
used. For participants who were consid-
ered "other Hispanic," the IDF thresholds
for ethnic South and Central Americans
were used.
According to the NCEP report, partic-
ipants who had three or more of the fol-
lowing criteria were defined as having the
metabolic syndrome (3,8): 1) abdominal
obesity (waist circumference 102 cm in
men and 88 cm in women), 2) concen-
tration of triglycerides 150 mg/dl (1.7
mmol/l), 3) concentration of HDL choles-
terol 40 mg/dl (1.03 mmol/l) in men
and 50 mg/dl (1.29 mmol/l) in women,
4) a systolic blood pressure 130 mmHg
or a diastolic blood pressure 85
mmHg), and 5) fasting glucose: 100
mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l). The participants
who currently reported using antihyperten-
sive or antidiabetic medication (insulin or
oral agents) were counted as having high
blood pressure or diabetes, respectively.
The waist circumference was mea-
sured at the high point of the iliac crest at
minimal respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm.
Serum triglyceride concentration was
measured enzymatically after hydrolyza-
tion to glycerol, and HDL cholesterol was
measured after the precipitation of other
lipoproteins with a heparin-manganese
chloride mixture. Plasma glucose concen-
tration was measured using an enzymatic
reaction.
Up to four blood pressure readings
were obtained in the mobile examination
center. The average of the last two mea-
surements of blood pressure for the par-
ticipants who had three or four
measurements, the last measurement for
the participants with only two measure-
ments, and the only measurement for the
participants who had one measurement
were used to establish high blood pres-
sure status.
The prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome was examined according to strata
of BMI, degree of glucose impairment, hy-
pertension, smoking status, hypercholes-
terolemia, concentrations of C-reactive
protein, and coronary heart disease sta-
tus. BMI was calculated from measured
height and weight. Four categories of
glucose impairment were created: normo-
glycemia (fasting plasma glucose concen-
tration 100 mg/dl), impaired fasting
glucose (fasting plasma glucose concen-
tration 100 to 126 mg/dl), undiagnosed
diabetes (fasting plasma glucose concen-
tration 126 mg/dl without self-reported
diabetes), and diagnosed diabetes (based
on self-report). Hypertension was defined
as a systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg
or a diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg
or the current use of antihypertensive
medication. Current smokers were de-
fined as participants who had smoked
100 cigarettes during their lifetime and
were still smoking. Former smokers were
defined as participants who had smoked
100 cigarettes during their lifetime but
had stopped. Participants who had
smoked 100 cigarettes during their life-
time were classified as never having
smoked. Participants whose concentra-
tion of total cholesterol was 200 mg/dl
or who reported currently using choles-
terol-lowering medications were defined
as having hypercholesterolemia. C-reac-
tive protein was measured by a high-
sensitivity assay (latex-enhanced
nephelometry). Questions about doctor-
diagnosed coronary heart disease, myo-
cardial infarction, and angina pectoris
were used to determine the presence of
these conditions.
Concentrations of plasma glucose
and serum triglycerides were measured
using reference analytic methods only for
the participants who attended the morn-
ing examination. Therefore, the analyses
were limited to men and nonpregnant
women aged 20 years who attended the
morning medical examination and who
had fasted for 8 h. Because of limited
sample size for the racial or ethnic groups
designated as "other race­including mul-
tiracial" and "other Hispanic," no results
were reported separately for these sub-
groups. To age adjust statistics, direct ad-
justment to the U.S. population aged 20
years in the year 2000 was performed (9).
SUDAAN (Software for the Statistical
Analysis of Correlated Data) was used for
the analyses to account for the complex
sampling design.
RESULTS -- A total of 4,059 partici-
pants attended the morning mobile exam-
ination center. Excluding those who
reported fasting for 8 h and the women
who were pregnant left 3,821 partici-
pants. Of these, 3,601 had the data
needed to define their metabolic syn-
drome status.
Using the NCEP definition, the unad-
justed prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome was 34.5% (men 33.7  1.6%
[percent  SE]; women 35.4  1.2%)
and the age-adjusted prevalence was
34.6% (men 34.4  1.5%; women
34.5  1.4%) (Table 1). In comparison,
the unadjusted and age-adjusted preva-
lences of the metabolic syndrome defined
according to IDF criteria were 39.0%
(men 39.9  1.7%; women 38.1  1.2%)
and 39.1% (men 40.7  1.6%; women
37.1  1.3%). The IDF definition did not
change the sex and racial or ethnic pat-
terns other than that for Mexican-
American men having a higher prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome than Mexican-
American women. The largest difference
in prevalence was found among Mexican-
American men, among whom the age-
adjusted prevalence was 40.3% using the
NCEP definition and 50.6% using the IDF
definition. When the IDF criteria for waist
circumference are used with the NCEP
definition, the unadjusted prevalence of
the metabolic syndrome was 40.3%,
which was similar to the estimate pro-
duced by the IDF definition. Using NCEP
criteria for waist circumference in con-
junction with the IDF definition yielded
an unadjusted prevalence of 29.4% (Ta-
ble 1).
The two definitions identified 92.9%
(95% CI 91.6­94.0) of the participants as
either having or not having the metabolic
syndrome. The percent agreement was
89.8% (87.6­91.6) among the men and
96.0% (94.6­97.0) among the women. In
1.3% (0.9­1.9) of the participants, the
metabolic syndrome using the NCEP def-
inition but not the IDF definition was
present. Another 5.8% (4.8­6.9) of the
participants had the metabolic syndrome
using the IDF definition but not the NCEP
definition.
For both of the definitions, the prev-
alence of the metabolic syndrome in-
creased strongly with increasing levels of
BMI (P for linear trend  0.001 for both
of the definitions), levels of dysglycemia
(P for linear trend  0.001 for both of the
definitions), and concentrations of C-re-
active protein (P for linear trend  0.001
for both of the definitions) (Table 2). Par-
ticipants with hypertension had more
than twice the prevalence of the metabolic
syndrome than those who did not have

hypertension (P  0.001 for both of the
definitions). In addition, participants
with hypercholesterolemia had a higher
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
than participants who had concentrations
of total cholesterol 200 mg/dl (P 
0.005 for both of the definitions). How-
ever, the prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome did not vary by smoking status (P
for all comparisons  0.05 for both of the
definitions). In addition, the participants
who reported having coronary heart dis-
ease had more than twice the age-adjusted
prevalence as did those who did not re-
port having coronary heart disease (P 
0.001 for both definitions). However, the
participants who had experienced a myo-
cardial infarction had a similar prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome as participants
who had not had a myocardial infarction
(P  0.05 for both definitions). The par-
ticipants who reported having angina
pectoris were also more likely to report
having the metabolic syndrome than the
participants who did not have it (P 
0.020 for the NCEP definition and P 
0.073 for the IDF definition).
CONCLUSIONS -- With the most
recent national data from U.S. adults and
the definition of the metabolic syndrome
proposed by the IDF, almost 40% of U.S.
adults were classified as having the meta-
bolic syndrome, a prevalence that is
higher than that estimated by the NCEP
definition (34.5%). The IDF criteria for
defining central obesity appeared to ac-
count for much of this difference. The
change was larger among men than
among women and can be explained by
the fact that the NCEP thresholds for
waist circumference of 102 cm for men
and 88 cm for women reflect much differ-
ent percentiles of the distribution among
U.S. adults than the IDF thresholds of 90
cm for men and 80 cm for women (10).
The use of thresholds for waist circumfer-
ence that are specific to different popula-
tions around the globe has been
repeatedly advocated (11­16). Because
the differences in estimates of prevalence
were especially pronounced for Mexican
Americans, the application of the IDF def-
inition to estimate the prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome will probably have a
substantial effect on the estimates in Asian
and Latin American countries. In general,
the sociodemographic patterns in preva-
lence were similar for the two definitions.
The two definitions similarly classi-
fied 93% of the participants as having or
not having the metabolic syndrome. The
high degree of overlap is not surprising
considering the fact that the two defini-
tions use the same five components and
that four of the five criteria are defined
identically or nearly identically. However,
there are several noteworthy differences.
The IDF definition requires the presence
of central obesity. In contrast, the NCEP
definition makes central obesity one of
the five equally weighted criteria. Fur-
thermore, the thresholds for central obe-
sity under the IDF definition are far lower
than those under the NCEP definition and
vary according to ethnicity. The thresh-
olds for concentrations of triglycerides,
HDL cholesterol, and glucose and for sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure are the
same. However, the IDF definition explic-
itly allows for the treatment of hypertri-
glyceridemia, a low concentration of HDL
cholesterol, and hypertension to be
counted. Furthermore, under the IDF
definition people who have diagnosed
type 2 diabetes are automatically consid-
ered to have hyperglycemia even if their
concentration of glucose is 100 mg/dl.
Only three major ethnic groups in the
NHANES 1999­2000 dataset had suffi-
cient numbers to allow for results to be
presented separately. Identification of
participants of South Asian, Chinese, or
Japanese descent who were included in

Metabolic syndrome prevalence
2748 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 28, NUMBER 11, NOVEMBER 2005
the category "other race­including multi-
racial" was not possible. Although the Eu-
ropid waist circumference thresholds
were used for this ethnic group to gener-
ate the results shown in this article, the
unadjusted prevalence estimate changed
little (39.1%) when thresholds of 90 cm
for men and 80 cm for women were used.
Only time will tell whether medical
professionals and researchers will em-
brace this new definition of the metabolic
syndrome. Prospective studies will be
needed to determine the risks for adverse
events associated with the metabolic syn-
drome as defined by the IDF. Because of
the similarities between the NCEP and
IDF definitions, risk estimates for all-
cause mortality, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, and other adverse events based
on the IDF definition are likely to be sim-
ilar to those observed for the NCEP defi-
nition. The evolution of definitions of the
metabolic syndrome since 1998 suggests
that the future will probably bring further
changes. In addition, the development of
a classification scheme of the metabolic
syndrome that correlates with the degree
of risk of experiencing adverse events and
the development of a formal pediatric def-
inition merit consideration. Regardless of
which definition is used, large numbers of
U.S. adults have the metabolic syndrome.
This fact underscores the importance of
promoting healthy lifestyles (proper nu-
trition, weight management, and ade-
quate physical activity) among U.S. adults.
