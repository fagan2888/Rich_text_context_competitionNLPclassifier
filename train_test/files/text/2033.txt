Abstract
Objective: Bisphenol A (BPA) is found in plastics and other consumer products; exposure may lead to insulin resistance and
development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through over-activation of pancreatic b-cells. Previous studies using data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed an inconsistent association between
prevalence of self-reported T2DM and urinary BPA. We used a different diagnosis method of T2DM (hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c)) with a larger subset of NHANES.
Methods and Findings: We analyzed data from 4,389 adult participants who were part of a sub-study of environmental
phenol measurements in urine from three NHANES cycles from 2003 to 2008. T2DM was defined as having a HbA1c $6.5%
or use of diabetes medication. The weighted prevalence of T2DM was 9.2%. Analysis of the total sample revealed that a two-
fold increase in urinary BPA was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.08 of T2DM (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02 to
1.16), after controlling for potential confounders. However, when we examined each NHANES cycle individually, we only
found a statistically significant association in the 2003/04 cycle (n = 1,364, OR = 1.23 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.42) for each doubling
in urinary BPA). We found no association in either the NHANES cycle from 2005/06 (n = 1,363, OR = 1.05 (95% CI, 0.94 to
1.18)); or 2007/08 (n = 1,662, OR = 1.06 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.23)). Similar patterns of associations between BPA and continuous
HbA1c were also observed.
Conclusions: Although higher urinary BPA was associated with elevated HbA1c and T2DM in the pooled analysis, it was
driven by data from only one NHANES cycle. Additional studies, especially of a longitudinal design with repeated BPA
measurements, are needed to further elucidate the association between BPA and T2DM.

Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high-volume production chemical used
worldwide in the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastics
including numerous consumer products like food and water
containers and bottles. BPA is also found in the resin linings of
food and beverage cans and dental sealants [1], leaching readily
from many of these products and leading to exposure in large
segments of the population [2]. Biomonitoring data indicate that
93% of U.S. general population aged six and older has detectable
levels of BPA in urine [3].
While BPA has been evaluated as an endocrine disruptor, the
potential metabolic effects of BPA are also of interest. Studies using
rodent models have suggested that BPA can alter insulin
biosynthesis and secretion in pancreatic b-cells, potentially through
the over-activation of the estrogen receptor, ERa [4­6]. This may
lead to insulin resistance and the subsequent development of type-2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Other evidence of BPA's metabolic
effects include dysregulation of glucose transport in adipocytes [7]
and inhibition of adiponectin release [8].
Previous epidemiological studies using data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which
combines questionnaires and physical exams to assess health and
nutrition in the U.S. population (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes.htm) have shown an inconsistent association between the
prevalence of self-reported T2DM and urinary BPA levels. In
NHANES 2003­2004, T2DM was positively associated (odds ratio
(OR) = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21 to 1.60) with a 1
standard deviation increase in BPA) [9], but this association was
not found in the subsequent cycle of NHANES 2005­2006
(OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.38) [10].
Although self-reported diabetes is reported to be reasonably in
agreement with medication use and the clinical cutoff, as
determined by fasting glucose levels (126 mg/dL or higher) [11­
13], the possibility of an underestimation of diabetes in the
population by using this outcome measure still exists, since people
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 10 | e26868
may not be aware of their true clinical status [14]. Recently, the
International Expert Committee recommended the use of the
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a measure of glycated hemoglobin in
red blood cells, as an alternative method for the diagnosis of
diabetes [15].
In addition to potential problems with the diabetes outcome metric
used in previous studies, those previous studies also assumed linear
exposure-response relations between urinary BPA and the health
outcomes including T2DM [9,10]. Non-linear exposure-response
relations are frequently observed in environmental epidemiologic
studies when biomonitoring exposure data are used. Often, a higher
slope in the lower exposure region and a plateau in the higher
exposure region (log-linear exposure-response) is observed [16].
Therefore, a more thorough exploration of the shape of the exposure-
response curve may be warranted to aid assessment of the risks BPA
may pose to human health, and in particular, metabolic function.
Given the increasing burden of T2DM and the ubiquitous
exposures to BPA, determining if the two are associated may have
important implications for prevention. Here, we examined the
possible association between BPA exposure and T2DM, defined as
HbA1c greater than and equal to 6.5%, in an expanded NHANES
population combining three independent cycles from 2003 to 2008
as well as in individual cycles. We also explored exposure-response
relations using a smoothing method (natural splines).
Methods
Ethics Statement
NHANES is a publicly available data set and all participants in
NHANES provide written informed consent, consistent with
approval by the National Center for Health Statistics Institutional
Review Board.
Study Population
Data were from the U.S. NHANES 2003/04, 2005/06, and
2007/08 study cycles (continuous NHANES) [17]. NHANES is a
cross-sectional study designed to be representative of the health
and diet of the non-institutionalized U.S. population. NHANES
employs a stratified sampling design with accompanying design
weights. For the present study, 4,792 adults, aged 20 years or
older, who participated in the sub-study of the environmental
phenol measurement in urine, were eligible. Eight subjects with
urinary BPA concentrations greater than 80.1 ng/mL were
excluded, consistent with previous reports [9,10]. An additional
403 subjects were excluded because data were missing for
important covariates, decreasing the final sample size to 4,389
subjects (1,364 from NHANES 2003/04; 1,363 from NHANES
2005/06; 1,662 from NHANES 2007/08).
Urinary BPA
A one-third random subset of NHANES subjects was selected and
asked to provide spot urine samples for subsequent laboratory
analysis. Total urinary BPA, both conjugated and free, was measured
using online solid-phase extraction coupled to high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-isotope dilution tandem mass
spectrometry at the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences (National Center for Environmental Health, CDC).
Extensive quality assurance and quality control (QC) procedures
were followed, including confirmation that samples were not
contaminated during collection, handling and analysis [18,19]. The
coefficients of variation were 8.1­18.6% for the low BPA QC pools
and 5.7­12.1% for the high BPA QC pools. The lower limit of
detection (LLOD) was 0.36 ng/mL in 2003/04 and 0.4 ng/mL in
2005/06 and 2007/08 NHANES cycles. Urinary BPA concentra-
tions below LLOD were found in 8.5%, 9.6% and 7.8% of the
participants in the 2003/04, 2005/06 and 2007/08 cycles,
respectively. For these participants, we substituted a value equal to
the LLOD divided by the square-root of two. To be consistent with
the previous study by Melzer et al. [10], we assigned the value of
LLOD/!2 (0.28 ng/mL) used in the 2005/06 and 2007/08 cycles to
those participants from the NHANES 2003/04 cycle.
Hemoglobin A1c and T2DM
HbA1c was measured with HPLC by the Diabetes Diagnostic
Laboratory at the University of Missouri-Columbia using Primus
CLC 330 and Primus CLC 385 (Primus Corporation, Kansas
City, MO) in the 2003/04 cycle and the Diabetes Laboratory at
the University of Minnesota using Tosoh A1c 2.2 PlusGlycohe-
moglobin Analyzer (Tosoh Medics, Inc., San Francisco, CA) in the
2005/06 and 2007/08 cycles. Two types of QC were used: 1)
batch QC specimens placed in each run, and 2) sample QC
specimens (2% of the total specimens) were randomly selected
from each run and analyzed in a second run. The coefficients of
variation were 1.4­1.7% for normal HbA1c QC pools and 0.8­
1.1% for elevated HbA1c QC pools in all three NHANES cycles.
A crossover calibration study to compare the 2005/06 Tosoh
method to the 2003/04 Primus method revealed a significant
difference [20] which required the application of the following
adjustment, Y (Tosoh) = -0.5279 + 1.0781*X (Primus), prior to
undertaking statistical analyses. T2DM was defined as HbA1c
$6.5% or self-reported use of diabetes medication (insulin or
blood sugar-lowering pills).
Other covariates
Demographic information, medical history and physical and
laboratory assessment were obtained by self-report, computer-assisted
personal interviewing and physical examination, respectively. Gender
was categorized as male or female. Race/ethnicity was categorized
into five groups: Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic
White, non-Hispanic Black, and other. Self-reported educational
attainment was categorized into three levels: ,high school, high
school diploma, and some college and over. Self-reported annual
household income was categorized into five levels: ,$20,000,
$20,000 to $34,999, $35,000 to $64,999, $65,000 and over, and
unknown income (``over $20,000'' (n=92, 2% of the sample) was
classified into unknown). Smoking status was categorized into never,
former, and current occasional and daily smokers. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as measured weight in kilograms divided by
measured height in meters squared. Waist circumference was
measured in centimeters. Urinary creatinine, an indicator of renal
status, was measured on the Beckman CX3 using a Jaffe reaction in
the NHANES 2003/04 and 2005/06 cycles and on the Roche ModP
using an enzymatic (creatinase) method in the NHANES 2007/08
cycle. Because the Jaffe method is subject to more interference,
NHANES conducted a crossover study to identify the following
equations to adjust urinary creatinine assayed before 2007 [21]:

These adjustments were applied for the current analysis.
Statistical Analysis
NHANES implemented a complex cluster sample design to
include adequate representation from various socioeconomic
strata and minorities. In recognition of these design effects, we
computed weighted estimates according to the NHANES Analytic
and Reporting Guidelines [22] including six-year sampling
weights. We used the survey package (version 3.22-3) in R
software (version 2.11.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
http://www.r-project.org).
The distribution of urinary BPA was highly right-skewed, and
thus, we computed survey-weighted geometric means and
geometric standard errors (SEs). We used survey-weighted
generalized linear models to fit binary T2DM and continuous
HbA1c outcomes. The following variables were chosen a priori as
covariates in the models because of their biological relevance to
the outcomes: age (linear and quadratic terms), gender, race/
ethnicity, education, income, BMI, waist circumference, smoking
status and urinary creatinine [3,9,10,23]. We modeled urinary
creatinine with a natural spline (restricted cubic spline) with four
degrees of freedom (knots at 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) to
accommodate potential nonlinearity because log-transformation
or adding a quadratic term could not capture such nonlinearity
well. We constructed sequential covariate models: model 1
adjusted for urinary creatinine and age; model 2: further
adjustment for gender, race-ethnicity, education and income;
model 3 further adjustment for smoking status, BMI, and waist

circumference. BMI and waist circumference appeared collinear
but we kept both in the model because the effect estimate of
urinary BPA was not influenced by fitting either variable and in
order to make our model comparable to the models of the previous
two NHANES-based studies [9,10].
We examined the shapes of dose-response relations by fitting the
term for BPA using natural splines with four degrees of freedom.
Graphs of these natural splines showed that the association
between urinary BPA and both T2DM and HbA1c was close to a
log-linear association (Figure 1), so we chose a log-transformation
of urinary BPA for the final statistical model.
To evaluate the consistency of the relationships across the
NHANES cycles, we repeated the same regression models for each
cycle individually, using each cycle's sampling weight. Finally, we
assessed for effect modification by age (20­39/40­59/$60 years),
gender, race/ethnicity, education, household income, smoking
status and BMI (,25/25­29.9/$30 kg/m2) by adding an
interaction term between log-transformed urinary BPA and the
corresponding characteristics, along with the main effects from
model 3. We obtained p-values for linear trend of ordinal variables
(age, education, household income and BMI), as well as p-values
for comparisons of the other categorical variables.

(SE = 0.02). The prevalence of T2DM was 9.2%. The mean age
was 46.5 years (SE = 0.36) and 51.5% of the sample were females.
There was a statistically significant difference in the urinary BPA
concentrations across cycles. The geometric means of urinary BPA
were 2.4 ng/mL (95% CI, 2.1 to 2.7) in NHANES 2003/04,
1.7 ng/mL (95% CI, 1.6 to 1.9) in NHANES 2005/06, and
2.0 ng/mL (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.1) in NHANES 2007/08
(p,0.0001). The HbA1c level in NHANES 2007/08 (5.6%) was
significantly higher than that of the other two cycles (5.4%)
(p,0.001), and there was a marginally significant difference in the
prevalence of T2DM by the cycle (7.8%, 9.0%, 10.7% from
NHANES 2003/04 to 2007/08, respectively; p = 0.06). The un-
calibrated HbA1c level in NHANES 2003/04 was 5.5% (data not
shown). Urinary BPA concentrations were higher in younger
adults, males, participants with lower income, and current smokers
(Table 2).
Table 3 shows the logistic regression results for models with
various sets of covariate in the pooled data and by each cycle.
After adjusting for urinary creatinine, age, gender, race-ethnicity,
education, household income, BMI, waist circumference, and
smoking status (model 3), the ORs for T2DM for a two-fold
increase in urinary BPA were 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.16), 1.23
(95% CI, 1.07 to 1.42), 1.05 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.18), and 1.06 (95%
CI, 0.91 to 1.23) in the pooled data, NHANES 2003/04, 2005/06,
and 2007/08 cycles, respectively. The associations between
urinary BPA and T2DM seemed to be robust to the influences

of the demographic variables, obesity and smoking (Table 3,
models 1 and 2). Similar associations were found when urinary
BPA and continuous HbA1c outcome was examined (Table 4).
There were statistically significant associations in the pooled data
(0.017% change (95% CI, 0.001% to 0.032%) in HbA1c for a
doubling in urinary BPA in model 3), and in the NHANES 2003/
04 cycle (0.048% change in HbA1c (95% CI, 0.019% to 0.076%)),
but we did not observe statistically significant associations for
either the NHANES 2005/06 or 2007/08 cycles.
Figure 2 shows results of the effect modification analysis in the
association between urinary BPA and T2DM by participant
characteristics. No effect modification by age, gender, race-
ethnicity, education, household income, smoking status, or BMI
was observed.
Discussion
With remarkable increases in prevalence, T2DM is considered
an emerging pandemic in the 21st century and is an important
public health concern. Recently, attention has been paid to the
potential contribution of BPA to the etiology of this disease, and
the study by Lang et al., that reported statistically significant
associations between urinary BPA and self-reported, physician-
diagnosed heart disease and T2DM in the NHANES 2003/04
cycle [9], has catalyzed a hot debate on the potential role of BPA
as a ``diabetogen'' [24]. The present work complements the
analyses of Lang et al. [9] and Melzer et al. [10] by further
examining the question of whether or not BPA exposure may have
an adverse impact on glucose homeostasis, and by further
expanding the NHANES cycles through 2007/08. HbA1c was
used as a biomarker for glucose homeostasis and T2DM, rather
than the previously studied, self-reported, physician-diagnosed
diabetes measurement.
Here, we found that urinary BPA concentrations were signifi-
cantly positively associated with the prevalence of T2DM as well as
the continuous measure of HbA1c when all three NHANES cycles
were combined and analyzed together. However, when we
completed the analyses separately for each NHANES cycle, we
only found a statistically significant association between urinary
BPA and T2DM and HbA1c in the NHANES 2003/04 cycle.
Further, there was no consistency in the association among different
cycles. This suggests that the observed, statistically significant
association in the pooled data may actually be driven by data from
only one NHANES cycle. This may, in part, be due to the
significantly higher mean levels of BPA found in 2003/04 (2.4 ng/
mL) versus 2005/06 (1.7 ng/mL) and 2007/08 (2.0 ng/mL). It is
unclear whether this difference is due to random chance or some
variation in the sampling of the different cycles. It is unlikely that the
significantly lower mean urinary BPA concentrations for 2005­
2008 are due to a decrease in exposure to BPA, since it is only
recently that BPA has captured the public's attention thus leading to
an increased number of BPA-free products on the market. It may be
most likely, however, that the non-significant associations in 2005/
06 and 2007/08 cycles were due to lowered statistical power as a
result of the narrower range (less variation) of urinary BPA (95% CI,
2.1 to 2.7 ng/mL in 2003/04 versus 1.6 to 1.9 ng/mL in 2005/06
and 1.8 to 2.1 ng/mL in 2007/08, Table 1). Graphical examination
using natural splines revealed that the exposure-response relation-
ships were close to being log-linear rather than linear (Figure 1).
This suggests that the assumption of linearity in the association
between BPA and T2DM made in previously published work may
not be appropriate.

We chose HbA1c as the outcome for this study for two reasons.
First, HbA1c is relatively more stable compared to other markers
of glycemic indices, such as fasting blood glucose, because it
provides a measure of average blood glucose over the previous two
to three months [25]. Second, a continuous biomarker such as
HbA1c would better capture individuals with undiagnosed disease,
which could reduce outcome misclassification. Seven million
people in the U.S. are believed to have undiagnosed diabetes [26].
The absence of diagnosis is likely the biggest concern in
underserved populations, those of lower socioeconomic status,
and those with poorer access to healthcare. A study of newly-
admitted hospital patients in the Bronx, New York found that 35%
of patients had HbA1c levels that met the clinical definition of
T2DM but had never been diagnosed [27]. Therefore, we
considered HbA1c a favorable outcome measure for this study
because it would include individuals without a physician's
diagnosis who might otherwise have been excluded.
Some diabetes researchers and physicians argue that several
factors could potentially lead to inaccuracies in the HbA1c test and
a subsequent misdiagnosis. These include any kind of hemoglo-
binopathy, such as sickle cell anemia or other anemias, which tend
to be found more frequently in subjects of selected race/ethnicity,
gender or age [25,28]. This possibility is unlikely to have
influenced our results, because age, gender and race-ethnicity
did not modify the association between urinary BPA and T2DM
in the present study. An additional issue with HbA1c is that there
seem to be inconsistencies across laboratory equipment and
methods so that results vary based on the laboratory performing
the test [25,28]. In NHANES, the laboratory methods for HbA1c
were changed between 2003/04 (Primus method) and 2005/06
(Tosoh method). One may argue that the statistically significant
association found only in the NHANES 2003/04, but not in the
other two cycles, is due to the difference in the assay method for
HbA1c. This is unlikely, however, because we adjusted the 2003/
04 HbA1c values using the calibration equation suggested by
NHANES [20] (provided in Methods) and because our results are
consistent with those found using self-reported diagnosis of
T2DM. Lastly, T2DM is strongly associated with heart disease
and heart disease medications, such as diuretics, can affect the
clearance of BPA. Thus, because increased BPA levels in urine
could be a consequence of treatment of heart disease, the cross-
sectional association between BPA and T2DM could be capturing
the association between T2DM and heart disease. In our study,
subjects who took diuretics had significantly higher concentrations
of urinary BPA than those who did not (age, gender, race-
ethnicity, and urinary creatinine-adjusted difference in urinary
BPA = 1.19 ng/mL (95% CI, 1.08, 1.31), p,0.001). However,
inclusion of diuretic use in the model only slightly attenuated the
observed associations and did not change the overall patterns of
association (data not shown).
Although there is scant evidence of the association between BPA
exposure and T2DM or other relevant biomarkers in human

populations, the physiological plausibility of BPA's effect on
metabolic homeostasis has been explored in both rodent and
human tissue culture models and several mechanisms have been
proposed. The first is that BPA may lead to overstimulation of the
estrogen receptor ERa in pancreatic b-cells. ERa plays a role in
increasing insulin biosynthesis in response to increased physiolog-
ical concentrations of estrogen, such as during pregnancy [5].
Studies in male mice have shown that BPA may also stimulate
insulin biosynthesis and secretion through ERa, leading to
hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance [5,6]. Additionally, genetic
defects of ERa are associated with impaired glucose metabolism,
insulin resistance, T2DM and metabolic syndrome [29­31]. A
second proposed mechanism is that BPA mimics estradiol (E2)
which is also important to maintaining insulin sensitivity and b-cell
function during physiologically relevant periods [32,33]. Male
mice treated with either BPA or E2 show altered glucose tolerance,
insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia [6,34,35]. A third
mechanism suggested is that BPA may suppress adiponectin, an
adipocyte-specific hormone responsible for maintaining insulin
sensitivity [36], and that is known to be reduced prior to
development of T2DM [37]. Hugo et al. compared the effects of
low doses of BPA and E2 on adiponectin secretion from human
breast cells, adipose explants and mature adipocytes and found
that low doses of BPA and E2 were both effective at suppressing
adiponectin release in all tissue types [7]. Similarly, Ben-Jonathan
et al. also found that low doses of BPA inhibited adiponectin
release in human adipose tissue [8]. This body of evidence suggests
that exposure to BPA may lead to altered metabolic homeostasis
via multiple pathways.
The strengths of this study include 1) the use of three
independent representative samples of the U.S. general population
(including oversampled minority populations), which enables the
observed results to be generalizable; 2) the use of NHANES data
conducted with strict quality control procedures; and 3) the fact
that this is the first and largest study of BPA exposure and HbA1c,
a stable marker of glycemic index.
Despite HbA1c's benefits, the cross-sectional design used in the
NHANES survey may limit causal inferences. Only a single urine
sample and a single blood draw were taken for each patient
studied in this analysis. While HbA1c is considered relatively
stable over several months, BPA is believed to have a short half-life
in the human body, with generally all BPA being eliminated within
24 hours of exposure [38]. Exposure assessment using a single
urine sample makes it impossible to address the temporal
variability of a person's BPA exposure. In fact, BPA concentrations
in urine have been found to be highly variable from day to day and
the reproducibility has been low [39,40]. This variability would
lead to a non-differential misclassification and therefore bias the
association towards the null. Therefore, the use of a single urinary
measurement of environmental exposure as a predictor of chronic
disease may not be appropriate, especially when the exposure is
believed to be relatively short-lived in the human body. While a
recent study suggested that the half-life of BPA within the
population might be longer than originally believed, the observed
stability could also be an effect of continuous widespread exposure
in the population, including from non-food sources [41].
Therefore, longitudinal studies, with multiple measures over a
much longer time period, will be necessary in order to further
investigate if there is a true association between BPA exposure and
T2DM.
Additionally, because this study only examined concurrent BPA
exposure among adults, it was impossible to investigate any effect
that BPA exposure during critical growth periods, such as
prenatally, may be having on disease. This is an important
research aspect as evidence is mounting that is suggestive that
early life exposures may predispose an individual to developing
disease later in life [42­44]. A recent study in mice even suggested
that maternal exposure to BPA could lead to altered metabolic
homeostasis in offspring [45]. Male offspring who were exposed to
BPA in utero were found to have significantly reduced glucose
tolerance and increased insulin resistance compared to the
offspring of untreated mothers [45]. This would be an important
area of future research, given that BPA has been detected in
human breast milk, amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal and cord
blood [2,38].
Given their widespread prevalence in the environment,
investigating the role of environmental contaminants like BPA in
the pathogenesis of T2DM, obesity and metabolic syndrome is of
significant public health importance. While the results of this work
have limitations, further study of this possible association is
warranted, both to explore possible physiologic pathways involved
as well as to understand if long-term exposure and exposure
during critical periods of growth and development may play a role
in the development of T2DM and other metabolic diseases.
