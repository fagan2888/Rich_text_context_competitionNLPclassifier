ABSTRACT
To examine the mechanisms of drug relapse, we first
established a model for cocaine IVSA (intravenous self-
administration) in mice, and subsequently examined elec-
trophysiological alterations of MSNs (medium-sized spiny
neurons) in the NAc (nucleus accumbens) before and after
acute application of cocaine in slices. Three groups were in-
cluded: master mice trained by AL (active lever) pressings
followed by IV (intravenous) cocaine delivery, yoked mice
that received passive IV cocaine administration initiated by
paired master mice, and saline controls. MSNs recorded in
the NAc shell in master mice exhibited higher membrane
input resistances but lower frequencies and smaller ampli-
tudes of sEPSCs (spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic cur-
rents) compared with neurons recorded from saline control
mice, whereas cells in the NAc core had higher sEPSCs fre-
quenciesandlargeramplitudes.Furthermore,sEPSCsinMSNs
of the shell compartment displayed longer decay times, sug-
gesting that both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms were
involved. After acute re-exposure to a low-dose of cocaine
in vitro, an AP (action potential)-dependent, persistent in-
crease in sEPSC frequency was observed in both NAc shell and
core MSNs from master, but not yoked or saline control mice.
Furthermore, re-exposure to cocaine induced membrane hy-
perpolarization, but concomitantly increased excitability of

MSNs from master mice, as evidenced by increased mem-
brane input resistance, decreased depolarizing current to
generate APs, and a more negative Thr (threshold) for firing.
These data demonstrate functional differences in NAc MSNs
after chronic contingent versus non-contingent IV cocaine
administration in mice, as well as synaptic adaptations of
MSNs before and after acute re-exposure to cocaine. Re-
versing these functional alterations in NAc could represent
a rational target for the treatment of some reward-related
behaviors, including drug addiction.
Key words: intravenous self-administration, nucleus
accumbens, relapse, synaptic transmission.
INTRODUCTION
Relapse, the major challenge in the treatment of drug abuse,
has been modeled in rodents by reinstatement of extin-
guished drug-seeking behaviors (Steketee and Kalivas, 2011).
Similar to humans, this phenomenon can be precipitated
by exposure to a small dose of the abused drug. Local
administration of cocaine into the NAc (nucleus accum-
bens) reinstated drug-seeking, whereas microinjection into
the dorsal striatum or lateral septum did not (Park et al.,
2002), showing that the drug's effects on the behavior are

anatomically specific. Using a reinstatement model, in con-
junction with inactivation of different pathways involved in
drug addiction, the neural circuitry involved in reinstatement
of drug-seeking has been mapped (Kalivas and McFarland,
2003). In this circuit, reinstatement pathways converge onto
a final common output through the NAc.
Chronic cocaine-induced functional alterations in the NAc
contribute to cocaine-elicited addiction behavior, includ-
ing drug-primed relapse to previously abused drugs (Hy-
man et al., 2006). Extensive efforts have been directed at
elucidating neuroadaptations of MSNs (medium-sized spiny
neurons), the principal cell type in the NAc, after chronic ex-
posure to either non-contingent (response-independent) or
contingent (response-dependent) administration of cocaine
(reviewed by Wolf, 2010). MSNs in the NAc receive excitatory
inputs from the pre-/infra-limbic cortex, ventral subiculum
and basolateral amygdala (Voorn et al., 2004; Sesack and
Grace, 2009), mixed excitatory and inhibitory neuromodula-
tion from dopaminergic neurons and inhibitory inputs from
local and afferent GABAergic circuits (Voorn et al., 2004;
Yan and Nabeshima, 2009). Although there are some reports
on the influence of chronic cocaine exposure on inhibitory
synaptic adaptations (Meshul et al., 1998; Kushner and Un-
terwald, 2001; Yamaguchi et al., 2002; Frankowska et al.,
2008a, b), growing evidence supports adaptions in glutamate
receptor-mediated synaptic activity after chronic cocaine ad-
ministration. Thus, AMPA (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazole-propionic acid) receptors are up-regulated at NAc
synapses after withdrawal from cocaine administration (Wolf,
2010).
The two major determinants of the functional output of
NAc MSNs, i.e., synaptic transmission and intrinsic membrane
excitability, have been extensively examined after cocaine
administration (Dong et al., 2006; Ishikawa et al., 2009; Mu
et al., 2010; Wolf, 2010). During early withdrawal (within
1 week) from either non-contingent or contingent cocaine,
a decreased intrinsic excitability of MSNs has been demon-
strated (Zhang et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2004;
Hu et al., 2005; Hu, 2007) (reviewed by Wolf, 2010). After a
longer withdrawal period from cocaine exposure with a non-
contingent cocaine history, a decrease in intrinsic excitability
occurs in MSNs, at least in the shell compartment. How-
ever, previous studies have also suggested that the effects of
contingent and non-contingent cocaine administration may
differ quantitatively or qualitatively, which could limit the
generality and validity of laboratory studies that use primar-
ily non-contingent administration (Winsauer et al., 2003).
Only a handful of studies have examined the functional out-
put of NAc MSNs in the cocaine contingent administration
model (Mu et al., 2010).
Considering that relapse after a long period of abstinence
is a major clinical problem when treating people with a sub-
stance use disorder (Hyman et al., 2006), it is imperative to
develop a reliable model of reinstatement of drug-seeking
behavior. Contingent drug administration, e.g., IVSA (intra-
venous self-administration) in rodents, has been recognized
as the best model to mimic addiction behavior in humans
(Shaham et al., 2003). This model thus represents a powerful
tool to explore potential mechanisms of drug addiction and
the functional alterations of NAc MSNs. The present exper-
iments were designed to study electrophysiological adapta-
tions in NAc MSNs in the IVSA mouse model of drug-primed
reinstatement using a complex paradigm that better repli-
cates the human condition, consisting of repeated cycles
of extinction-reinstatement. After establishment of cocaine-
seeking behavior, in vitro slices from trained mice were used
to examine changes in membrane excitability and synaptic
transmission in two conditions: firstly, under basal conditions
before cocaine re-exposure and secondly, following acute
exposure to cocaine which in a way is the in vitro equiva-
lent of drug-primed cocaine-seeking behavior. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study using such drug IVSA
extinction-reinstatement procedure in mice, in conjunction
with examination of functional alterations in synaptic activ-
ity and excitability of NAc MSNs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and housing
Male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)
were obtained at the age of 8­9 weeks and housed four
per cage with food and water ad libitum. Ambient vivarium
temperatures were maintained at 22C, and illumination
was provided for 12 h/day (7:00 AM on). Experimental proce-
dures were performed in accordance with the United States
Public Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of Labo-
ratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committee at the University of California,
Los Angeles.
Operant conditioning apparatus
Each operant chamber (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) was
fitted with an AL (active lever) and an IAL(inactive lever, 7 mm
above the gridfloor), a cue light positioned 45 mm above the
center of the two levers and a house light on the opposite wall
of the chamber. The position of the AL was counterbalanced
across individuals and within each group. Chambers were
located in sound-attenuating containers, with a fan that
always was on during the training sessions.
Catheter implantation, maintenance and patency
We used methods previously described (Thomsen and Caine,
2005, 2007). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane vapor
mixed with oxygen and implanted with a chronic indwelling
silastic catheter (0.2 mm i.d., 0.4 mm o.d.) connected to a 26-
gauge guide exteriorized cannula for drug administration in

the right or left jugular vein. The catheter was tunneled sub-
cutaneously to the base located in the midscapular region.
Two subcutaneous injections of carprofen (5 mg/kg) were
given right before and 24 h after surgery. Mice were allowed
7 days to recover, during which 0.02 ml of 0.9% (w/v) saline
containing heparin (30 USP units/ml) and antibiotic (cefa-
zolin, 67 mg/ml) was infused daily through the catheter to
forestall clotting and infection. During the following exper-
imental procedure of cocaine IVSA acquisition, the catheter
was flushed with heparinized saline before and after each
training session. Catheter patency was confirmed before and
after completion of cocaine IVSA acquisition phase by the
infusion of propofol (0.02 ml; 10 mg/ml). Loss of muscle tone
and clear signs of anesthesia within 3 s indicated catheter pa-
tency. Catheterization of rodents for IVSA, particularly mice,
is technically challenging. In the present study, a total of
51 mice were used but eight were excluded due to catheter
leakage or clogging (n = 7) or surgery-associated infection
(n = 1). No mortality due to the catheterization procedure
occurred.
Behavioral procedure of drug-primed cocaine
seeking
The schematic of in vivo behavioral procedure for modeling
drug-primed cocaine seeking is shown in the upper panel
of Figure 1. It consisted of a multi-staged procedure, which
started with the acquisition of cocaine IVSA, followed by
several cycles of extinction and reinstatement.
Acquisition of cocaine IVSA behavior
One week after jugular catheter implantation, training of
mice in the operant conditioning chambers was initiated.
The training session lasted 2 h/day, 5 days a week for 3­
4 weeks. Each session started with a house light on and both
levers extended. For master mice, the training started with
an FR 1 (fixed ratio 1) schedule of reinforcement, during
which one response to the assigned AL resulted in the pro-
grammed consequences, i.e., an IV drug injection through
the pre-implanted catheter as well as illumination of the
central cue light on and the extinguishing of the house light
for 20 s (time-out, no more injection was delivered after
active response). The criteria for moving from FR1 to FR5
phase included: (1) earning a minimum of 20 reinforcers
per session in two consecutive sessions; (2) varying in the
number of infusions earned by no more than 20% in two
consecutive sessions; (3) making at least 70% of all re-
sponses on the AL; (4) the passage of at least 2 weeks in
the FR1 phase. The FR5 training phase, usually 1­2 weeks,
progressed to the extinction phase when no more than 20%
variation in the number of reinforcers earned between the
two sessions occurred. Mice in the saline control group were
trained with the same procedure except the cocaine solu-
tion was replaced with saline. The training procedure of
mice in the yoked group strictly followed that of the cor-

responding paired masters, except each drug delivery and
presentation of visual cues were initiated by the paired
masters.
Extinction of established cocaine IVSA behavior
Mice in all three groups were trained in operant chambers
with everything similar as in the acquisition phase except that
all lever presses were recorded but were without programmed
consequences. Subjects remained in extinction until no more
than 20% variation in the number of AL responses be-
tween two consecutive sessions occurred, with a minimum of
2-week extinction period.
Drug-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking
Four cycles of reinstatement testing were performed in all
subjects 24 h after meeting the extinction criteria (see above).

Y.Y. Ma and others
In each cycle, mice were tested for their propensity to rein-
state drug-seeking behavior after a challenge injection of
cocaine (0, 1, 3.2 and 10 mg/kg IP, in random order) followed
by at least 2-day re-extinction until they met again the ex-
tinction criteria. The in vitro electrophysiological studies were
performed 24 h after the last extinction session. Thus, the end
point of behavioral training was when the subjects were at
the extinction phase. Forty-one of 43 mice reached the es-
tablished criteria.
Slice preparation and localization of MSNs in
the NAc sub-regions
A schematic for in vitro NAc MSNs recordings is shown in
the lower panel of Figure 1. Mice were decapitated, and
brains were quickly removed. Coronal slices containing the
NAc (300 m thickness) were prepared with a vibratome (Le-
ica) and incubated for at least 1 h in standard ASCF (artificial
cerebrospinal fluid) composed of the following (in mM): 130
NaCl, 26 NaHCO3
, 3 KCl, 2 MgCl2
, 1.25 NaHPO4
, 2 CaCl2
and
10 glucose [osmolality, 300 mOsm; pH 7.3-7.4, equilibrated
with 95% (v/v) O2
and 5% (v/v) CO2
]. All MSNs included
in this study were located within the NAc, in coronal slices
taken from 1.7 to 0.8 mm anterior to Bregma (Ma et al.,
2012). The anterior commissure and the islands of Calleja
were used as landmarks for locating the NAc core and shell
sub-regions. Coordinates for recording in NAc core were 1.3­
0.8 mm anterior to Bregma, within 200 m from the edge of
the anterior commissure, whereas in NAc shell coordinates
were 1.7­1.0 mm anterior to Bregma, 200­500 m medial
to the anterior commissure and 100­800 m dorsal to the
islands of Calleja (Franklin and Paxinos, 2007).
Electrophysiological recordings
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of NAc MSNs were per-
formed using methods adapted from those described previ-
ously (Cepeda et al., 1998; Cepeda et al., 2008). Cells also
were identified by somatic size, basic membrane properties
(input resistance, membrane capacitance and time constant),
and by addition of biocytin (0.15%) to the internal solution.
The patch pipette (3­5 M ) contained one of the following
solutions (in mM): 1) KGluc (K-gluconate internal solution):
K-gluconate 140, Hepes 10, MgCl2
2, CaCl2
0.1, EGTA 1.1
and K2
ATP 2, for voltage and current clamp; 2) CsMeth (Cs-
Methanesulfonate) internal solution: Cs-methanesulfonate
130, CsCl 10, NaCl 4, MgCl2
1, MgATP 5, EGTA 5, HEPES
10, GTP 0.5, phosphocreatine 10, leupeptin 0.1, for voltage
clamp recordings (pH 7.25­7.3, osmolality, 280­290 mOsm).
Access resistances were <25 M . sEPSCs (spontaneous ex-
citatory postsynaptic currents) and sIPSCs (spontaneous in-
hibitory postsynaptic currents) were recorded by holding the
membrane at - 70 mV and + 10 mV, respectively, in ACSF.
In specific experiments, sEPSCs were recorded in the presence
of the GABAA
receptor antagonist, bicuculline (BIC, 20 M)
in the external solution, and by holding the membrane at
- 70 mV. mEPSCs (miniature excitatory postsynaptic cur-
rents) were recorded after addition of TTX (tetrodotoxin,
1 M).
Recordings with CsMeth internal solution
Passive membrane properties were determined in VC (volt-
age clamp) mode by applying a depolarizing step voltage
command (10 mV) and using the membrane test function
integrated in the pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments). This
function reports membrane capacitance (Cm, in pF), input
resistance (Rin, in M ) and decay time constant (Tau, in
ms). This was obtained from a single exponential fit to
the decay of the capacitive transient. After characterizing the
basic membrane properties of the neuron, EPSCs/IPSCs were
recorded for 3­6 min. The membrane current was filtered at
1 kHz and digitized at 200 s using Clampex (Foster City,
CA). Spontaneous events were analyzed off-line using the
Mini Analysis Program (Jaejin Software). The Thr amplitude
for the detection of a synaptic event (generally 6 pA for
EPSCs and 10 pA for IPSCs), was adjusted to be 2­3 times
above the root-mean-square noise level. This software was
also used to calculate EPSC frequency, amplitude for each
synaptic event, and to construct time-frequency histograms.
Frequencies were expressed as number of events per second
(Hz).
Recordings with KGluc internal solution
Recordings started in the VC mode to measure passive mem-
brane properties following the same procedure used with
CsMeth internal solution. Then recordings were switched to
current clamp (IC) mode and measurements of membrane
properties were obtained following published methods (Heng
et al., 2008). The RMP (resting membrane potential) was
measured 5 min after the seal was ruptured. For membrane
excitability assessment, the membrane potentials of all the
neurons were held at - 80 mV in IC mode to make the mea-
surements from different neurons comparable. The rheobase
was defined as the minimal depolarizing current necessary to
evoke APs (action potentials). The Rin was calculated from the
voltage response to a hyperpolarizing current pulse ( - 100
pA). For measurements of a single AP, a Thr was determined
by differentiating the AP waveform and setting a rising rate
of 10 mV/ms as the AP inflection point.
Values in the figures and tables are presented as
mean +
- S.E. of the mean. Two-way (Figures 2, 4(B) and 4(C),
and Figures 5­7) or one-way (Figure 4D) rm (repeated mea-
sures) ANOVAs were followed by multiple comparisons using
Bonferroni post-hoc tests, except two-way ANOVAs followed
by Bonferroni post-hoc tests in Table 1 and Figure 3 and
paired Student's t tests in Figures 4(E) and 4(F). Differences
between means were considered statistically significant if
P < 0.05.

RESULTS
Establishment of drug-primed reinstatement of
cocaine-seeking behavior
Without prior operant conditioning training or food restric-
tion, C57BL/6J mice in the master group readily acquired
IVSA of cocaine (1 mg/kg per infusion) when it was rein-
forced on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement. The number
of AL pressings was significantly higher than IAL pressings
from the 6th day of training (AL versus IAL, F1, 234
= 25.43,
P < 0.0001; lever×day, F9, 234
= 7.79, P < 0.0001; post-hoc
test: at least P<0.05, AL versus IAL, Figure 2C, left). The yoked
mice, trained to receive cocaine IV deliveries each time the
specific paired master mice initiated IV administrations of
cocaine by AL pressings, did not show any preference for
the AL versus IAL (Figure 2B, left). Similarly, neither oper-
ant response was reinforced by programmed IV deliveries
of saline in control mice, showing that the visual cue itself
was not sufficient to support operant responding (Figure 2A,
left). The specificity of cocaine-reinforced AL responding in

ule (FR1 versus FR5, F1, 26

of Figure 2C). However, the change in schedule did not affect
the lever pressing rates in yoked or saline groups (right panels
of Figures 2A and 2B).
After a minimum 10 days of extinction training, the num-
ber of AL responses made by master mice declined to a
level not different than IAL responses (days, F9, 130

both FR1 and FR5, P<0.001, AL versus IAL; for AL, P < 0.001),
suggesting that drug-seeking behavior was extinguished
by this procedure (Figure 2D). The drug-primed reinstate-
ment tests in master mice showed that the number of
AL responses was significantly higher than that of IAL re-
sponses when an IP injection of cocaine at 3.2 mg/kg, but
not at 1 or 10 mg/kg, was given before reinstatement test-
ing (dose×lever, F1, 45
= 8.97, P < 0.0001; post-hoc test,
P < 0.001, AL versus IAL, primed by cocaine at 3.2 mg/kg,
Figure 2E). This inverted U-dose effect is consistent with
past studies (Weissenborn et al., 1996; Rosenzweig-Lipson
et al., 1997). The lever pressing paradigm in the yoked
and saline controls was not changed by an IP priming
injection of cocaine (0, 1, 3.2 and 10 mg/kg, results not
shown).

performed 24 h after the last extinction session. MSNs in NAc
shell from master mice showed significant increases in mem-
brane Rin compared with cells in the core compartment mea-
sured in VC mode (sub-region, F1, 60
= 6.04, P = 0.0169; be-
havioral procedure, F2, 60
= 3.64, P = 0.0321; post-hoc test,
P < 0.01, shell versus core MSNs from master mice, Table 1).
Higher Rin in the shell of master mice suggested that MSNs
in this region could be more excitable.
Compared with saline controls, MSNs in the NAc core of
masters showed a significantly higher frequency and larger
amplitude of sEPSCs, whereas in the NAc shell, a lower fre-
quency and smaller amplitude of sEPSCs were observed (sub-
region×behavioral procedure, for frequency, F2, 63
= 4.53,
P = 0.0145; for amplitude, F2, 63
= 6.43, P = 0.0029; post-
hoc test, for both frequency and amplitude, P<0.05, master
versus saline in the MSNs of NAc core and shell). This up-
regulation of sEPSCs in the core was specifically related to
active, contingent drug use/extinction history as it did not
occur in yoked mice or saline controls. Interestingly, while the
frequency of sEPSCs in MSNs of the core region in yoked mice
was similar to that of the saline group, in the shell it was sim-
ilar to the master group, suggesting that down-regulation of
sEPSCs in the shell is the consequence of repeated exposure
to cocaine, either in a contingent or non-contingent manner
(Figures 3A­3C). Furthermore, the decay time and duration
at half-width of sEPCS of shell MSNs were longer in master
mice than in saline controls (sub-region×behavioral proce-
dure, for decay time, F2, 63
= 3.21, P = 0.0470; for half-width
duration, F2, 63
= 3.35, P = 0.0415; post-hoc test, P<0.05,
master versus saline in the MSNs of NAc core and shell for
both frequency and amplitude).
Changes in sIPSCs were observed as well. The sub-regional
bidirectional modification in the frequency of synaptic activ-
ity, decreased in MSNs from the shell but increased in MSNs
from the core compartment, was also observed. However,
the amplitude of sIPSCs remained unchanged in master mice
compared with saline controls (results not shown).
Response of MSNs in the NAc after re-exposure
to cocaine in vitro
Effects on synaptic transmission during and after cocaine
bath application
MSNs from master, yoked and saline control mice showed
dose-dependent responses to acute in vitro cocaine ap-
plication (F2, 105
= 3.30, P = 0.0406) that were related to
the specific behavioral procedure (F2, 105
= 4.97, P = 0.0086,
Figure 4C). Thus, NAc MSNs from saline controls showed no
response to increasing concentrations (0.1, 1.0 and 10 M)
of cocaine (left panels of Figures 4A and 4B). In contrast,
the average sEPSC frequency in MSNs from master mice was
increased during application of cocaine at 0.1 and 1.0 M,
but decreased to control levels at 10 M (right panels of Fig-
ures 4A and 4B). The average frequency of sEPSCs in MSNs
from yoked mice showed a response only to the high dose
of cocaine and this effect was inhibitory (middle panels of
Figures 4A and 4B). This dose-dependent response of NAc
MSNs did not show sub-regional differences and data from
shell and core were pooled together. The number of cells
from each compartment was roughly half and half. Addi-
tional experiments demonstrated that the modification of
sEPSCs frequency in master mice by low doses of cocaine (0.1,
1.0 M) was abolished in the presence of TTX (F3, 5
= 7.326,
P = 0.0030; post-hoc test, P < 0.05, cocaine at 10 versus
0, 0.1, 1 M, Figure 4D). Furthermore, after pharmacological
isolation of sEPSCs by addition of BIC to the perfusate, the av-
erage frequency of sEPSCs in master mice was also increased
by cocaine at 0.1 M (t4
= 5.670, P = 0.0048, Figure 4E),
and this up-regulation disappeared in the presence of TTX
(t6
= 0.3178, P = 0.7614, Figure 4F). No changes of sEPSCs
amplitude were observed in master, yoked or saline control
mice, suggesting an AP-dependent mechanism of changes
occurring in response to acute cocaine in NAc MSNs from
mice subject to different behavioral procedures. In addition,
the sIPSCs of NAc MSNs from mice in all groups did not show
any specific modifications by cocaine bath application (0.1,
1.0, 10 M) (results not shown). These results suggest that

long-distance, excitatory projections, but not local inhibitory
inputs, to NAc MSNs of master mice are involved in mediating
the acute response of cocaine.
Interestingly, after an initial depressing effect during ap-
plication of the high cocaine dose (10 M), cells from master
mice reverted to an increased level of sEPSC frequency shortly
after washout, i.e., the frequency was higher than before co-
caine application. This effect persisted for more than 40 min

versus saline at 40 min of cocaine washout, Figure 5B) sug-
gesting a sort of rebound synaptic excitation, as well as the
existence of persistent changes in synaptic activity of NAc
neurons after re-exposure to cocaine. This effect did not oc-
cur in cells from saline or yoked mice, as the frequency of
sEPCSs was similar before cocaine and after washout. In con-
trast to sEPSCs, no changes in the frequency of sIPSCs were
detected after acute cocaine re-exposure in vitro. This sug-
gests sensitization of synaptic activity after acute cocaine
only involved glutamatergic inputs.

DISCUSSION
This study used a complex behavioral training procedure that
better replicates the experience of voluntary drug intake, fol-
lowed by relapse, commonly seen in the human condition,
although it is worth noting that most addicts ex-
perience abstinence, but not extinction learning. Our
procedure included acquisition, extinction and repeated
reinstatement/extinction cycles in mice trained by contin-
gent cocaine IVSA. With this multi-staged paradigm it was
possible to explore functional alterations of NAc MSNs using
in vitro electrophysiological recordings in slices before and
after acute re-exposure to cocaine. Our data clearly demon-
strate differences in passive and active membrane properties
of MSNs, as well as synaptic adaptations before and after
acute cocaine application in slices from saline, yoked and
master mice. Some neuroadaptations were region-specific,
while others were observed in both compartments. In master
mice, MSNs displayed higher Rin in the shell of NAc un-
der basal conditions, i.e., before acute re-exposure to co-
caine, compared to yoked and saline controls. In addition,
cells from master mice showed an AP-dependent increase in
sEPSC frequency after re-exposure to a low dose of cocaine
in vitro. Acute cocaine also induced membrane hyperpolar-
ization, but concomitantly increased membrane excitability
of MSNs from master mice, as evidenced by increased Rin, de-
creased current required to induce firing and hyperpolarized
AP Thr. These changes were not observed in yoked mice or
saline controls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report of functional alterations of NAc MSNs after chronic
contingent versus non-contingent cocaine exposure using
IVSA in mice, and also the first to examine the effects of

extinction training in conjunction with an in vitro equivalent
of cocaine-primed drug-seeking behavior at the cellular and
synaptic levels.
Regional and non-regional differences in NAc
MSNs before and after acute cocaine application
in slices
Passive membrane properties and spontaneous synaptic
transmission of MSNs from master mice were different in the
NAc shell versus core before cocaine re-exposure, consistent
with previous observations using non-contingent administra-
tion (Martin et al., 2006), in which opposite changes in ex-
citability of MSNs were reported between shell and core. The
decrease in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous synaptic
activity in the shell occurred in conjunction with increases in
membrane input resistance. While this may appear paradoxi-
cal, this increase could represent another synaptic adaptation
in response to reduced glutamatergic input, a sort of synap-
tic scaling (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004). For example, in NAc
neurons it has been shown that postsynaptic membranes are
capable of adjusting excitability in response to basal shifts
in excitatory synaptic input, a phenomenon called homeo-
static synapse-driven membrane plasticity (Ishikawa et al.,
2009). In contrast to our findings, another study reported
increased frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in the shell
compartment (Kourrich et al., 2007). However, in this study
very young mice were used and the cocaine treatment was
non-contingent. The apparent discrepancy with our results
underlines that age and mode of administration play a crit-
ical role in defining the outcomes of electrophysiological
changes.
There was no difference between core and shell in re-
sponse to acute cocaine treatment. The prolonged effects
of acute treatment during cocaine washout were also ho-
mogeneous in both compartments. Moreover, acute cocaine
treatment-induced changes in the intrinsic cellular excitabil-
ity, including RMP, Rin, current necessary to induce fir-
ing and Thr for APs also did not show sub-regional dif-
ferences. These results suggest that although cocaine IVSA
mice show sub-regional differences in passive membrane
properties, the increased membrane input resistance of NAc
shell MSNs from master mice may not be responsible for
mediating the cocaine-primed drug-seeking behavior but
a result of the training or extinction procedure. The pos-
sible mechanism of this change is presently unknown but
may involve modifications in DA and second messenger
cascades that alter specific K+ conductances (Dong et al.,
2004; Dong et al., 2005). It is also possible that DA lev-
els play a role. For example, withdrawal from cocaine self-
administration decreases tyrosine hydroxylase levels in NAc
shell but not core (Self et al., 2004). The absence of sub-
regional differences in response to cocaine re-exposure of
MSNs in the core versus shell is consistent with previous
in vivo studies which showed no sub-regional difference in
the NAc in reinstatement of cocaine-seeking (Famous et al.,
2007).
Excitatory but not inhibitory synaptic
transmission of NAc MSNs was involved in
specific responses to cocaine re-exposure in
master mice
Our results showed that both sEPSCs and sIPSCs were mod-
ulated by the chronic cocaine exposure history. Under basal
conditions, i.e., before cocaine application in slices, NAc MSNs
from master mice showed lower frequency and smaller EPSC
amplitude in the shell, but significantly higher frequency
and bigger amplitude in the core. Similar changes in sIP-
SCs frequency, but not amplitude, were observed. However,
changes to acute cocaine re-exposure in vitro were only de-
tected in the frequency of sEPSCs, but not sIPSCs. In addition,
the alterations in the frequency of the sEPSCs from master
mice was AP-dependent, suggesting adaptations in excita-
tory projections from pre-/infra-limbic cortex, but not of
local inhibitory, GABAergic inputs, mediated cocaine-primed
reinstatement of drug-seeking. This is consistent with ac-
cumulating evidence that glutamate inputs are necessary
for drug-primed cocaine-seeking behaviors, which could be
blocked by ablating (Peters et al., 2008) or manipulating the
cortical-NAc glutamatergic projections either pharmacolog-
ically (Berglind et al., 2009) or optogenetically (Suska et al.,
2013). While an essential role for cortical inputs to NAc has
been acknowledged, other excitatory inputs can induce plas-
tic changes in NAc neurons. In particular, a strong and spe-
cific projection from the ventral hippocampus to the medial
NAc shell has been shown to enhance synaptic strength after
cocaine administration, albeit using a non-contingent ad-
ministration paradigm (Britt et al., 2012). As MSNs in both
compartments were sensitized by acute re-exposure to co-
caine in our IVSA paradigm, it is likely that inputs from
the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala also play an
important role. Although changes in NAc GABAB
receptor-
mediated activity in vitro from rats trained by either con-
tingent or non-contingent cocaine have been reported (Mu
et al., 2010; Wolf, 2010), a few studies have focused directly
on the involvement of GABAergic mechanisms in cocaine-
primed reinstatement of drug-seeking, except for one study
showing that administration of GVG, an irreversible GABA (-
aminobutyric acid) transaminase inhibitor, dose-dependently
inhibits cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking be-
havior in rats (Peng et al., 2008).
Sensitized synaptic activity was observed in NAc
MSNs from master, but not yoked or saline mice

transmission in the NAc MSNs. These findings are in agree-
ment with results in dorsal striatum using chronic adminis-
tration of metamphetamine (Bamford et al., 2008). A pro-
longed state of corticostriatal depression is followed by a
paradoxical pre-synaptic potentiation upon re-exposure to
the drug. Because adding BIC had no effects on the response
of sEPSCs to a low dose of cocaine, local inhibitory circuits
seemed not involved. However, this sensitized response in
master mice was abolished in the presence of TTX, suggest-
ing that an AP-dependent glutamate release was sensitized
at the pre-synaptic level and could be involved in mediating
the cocaine-primed drug-seeking behaviors. Although a tight
relationship between glutamate levels and cocaine-primed
reinstatement has been demonstrated in rats by in vivo co-
caine IVSA (Baker et al., 2003; Madayag et al., 2007), lack of
examination of glutamate synaptic activity in the yoked sub-
jects limits the relevance of these observations. Our current
data demonstrated that (1) increased AP-dependent release
of glutamate might be involved in cocaine seeking in the
mouse IVSA model; and (2) this sensitized glutamate synap-
tic activity probably resulted from the active drug-taking
history, not the prolonged effects of chronic cocaine ex-
posure history itself as it did not occur in yoked mice. An
additional mechanism that could contribute to sensitized
responses to cocaine is the well-known enhancing effect
of DA, via D1 receptors, on glutamatergic activity (Cepeda
et al., 1993; Ma et al., 2009), as re-exposure to cocaine pro-
duces an increase of DA concentration in slices (Ortiz et al.,
2010).
An interesting finding is that in the presence of TTX
sEPSCs frequency of NAc MSNs from master mice showed
a similar response to cocaine as that from yoked mice,
i.e., no response to low doses (0.1, 1 M), whereas fre-
quency was decreased by a high dose (10 M) of co-
caine. Thus, we hypothesize that pharmacological effects
of chronic IV cocaine administration after prolonged with-
drawal is encoded in the NAc MSNs by an AP-independent
mechanism, possibly mediated by postsynaptic mechanisms.
However, the long persistence of compulsive drug-seeking
behaviors was mediated by an AP-dependent mechanism,
which more possibly resulted from alterations in pre-synaptic
pathways. This AP-dependent mechanism showed a glu-
tamate sensitized response to low dose (0.1, 1 M) co-
caine treatments, but the AP-independent response was only
observed at the high dose (10 M). It appears that pre-
and postsynaptic mechanisms in the NAc play differential
roles in the long-persistence of emotional/motivational and
pharmacological-related effects, respectively. Indeed, it has
been demonstrated that the down-regulation of sEPSCs in
striatal MSNs occurs in response to a high dose of co-
caine (10 M) (Wu et al., 2007). However, at high concen-
trations cocaine may produce anesthetic effects by reduc-
ing the amplitude of Na+ currents (Crumb and Clarkson,
1990).
Could changes in intrinsic excitability of NAc MSNs af-
ter cocaine re-exposure be attributable to contingent versus
non-contingent cocaine administration, or route of adminis-
tration? Our data demonstrated that after a prolonged period
of drug withdrawal, no differences occurred in the basal val-
ues of RMP, Rin, current required to induce APs and Thr
for firing from mice with IVSA cocaine history versus saline
controls. This is consistent with the only previous study us-
ing contingent IV cocaine administration in rats, although in
this study a temporary decrease of MSN intrinsic excitability
during the early stage of cocaine withdrawal was observed
(Mu et al., 2010). However, there is evidence that during
both early (within 1 week) and late stage (after 2­3 weeks)
of withdrawal from repeated non-contingent IP injections
of cocaine significant decreases of intrinsic excitability of
NAc MSNs occur (Kourrich and Thomas, 2009; Mu et al.,
2010). More importantly, the NAc MSNs from IV yoked mice,
which serves as a better non-contingent administration con-
trol for IV masters than mice receiving non-contingent IP
injections, did not show any changes in RMP, Rin, depolar-
izing current necessary to evoke APs, and Thr of APs, which
is different from the controls with non-contingent IP in-
jections. This suggests that the intrinsic excitability of NAc
MSNs, although clearly related to the stage of withdrawal,
does not depend on contingent or non-contingent cocaine
administration. The way by which cocaine is delivered, IP or
IV, is hypothesized to be responsible for alterations of in-
trinsic excitability of NAc MSNs in mice with a history of
chronic cocaine exposure. For example, in Mu's study, after a
3-week cocaine withdrawal the membrane excitability of NAc
MSNs, which remained low in IP treated rats, returned to a
normal level in IVSA-treated rats. This can be explained by dif-
ferent pharmacokinetics of these two routes of drug adminis-
tration. The behavioral effects of IV administration of cocaine
has a more rapid onset and termination relative to IP admin-
istration (O'Dell et al., 1996). In humans, IV administration of
cocaine produces greater physiological changes and more in-
tense subjective effects relative to other routes (Resnick et al.,
1977).
Although the present methodology probably represents
the best way to examine changes in NAc MSN properties in
a mouse model of drug-seeking behavior, one limitation is
that, because of the complex training paradigm, it is difficult
to determine the exact source and timing of electrophysi-
ological changes in NAc MSNs in the in vitro studies. Thus,
permanent changes could be attributed to acquisition, ex-
tinction, and/or reinstatement phases. Notwithstanding this
limitation, our study opens new alternatives for a deeper
understanding of the mechanisms of drug-seeking behavior.
The availability of genetically modified laboratory animals,
e.g., mice expressing green fluorescent protein as a reporter
of specific neuronal populations of the striatum, will allow
defining better the contribution of the direct and indirect
pathways in drug addiction. Based on our previous work
(Cepeda et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2012) as well as the cur-
rent literature, we can speculate that sensitized responses to
cocaine occur mainly in D1 receptor-containing MSNs (see
also (Lobo et al., 2010; Pascoli et al., 2010; Lobo and Nestler,

Nucleus accumbens excitability and cocaine relapse
2011; Chandra et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013). For exam-
ple, it has been shown that overexpression of the transcrip-
tion factor FosB in direct, but not indirect, pathway MSNs
enhances behavioral responses to cocaine (Grueter et al.,
2013), and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phos-
phorylation after acute or chronic cocaine injections is con-
fined to D1 MSNs in NAc and dorsal striatum (Bertran-
Gonzalez et al., 2008). In addition, a selective increase in
spine density occurred in D1 MSNs after chronic cocaine ex-
posure (Kim et al., 2011). However, a role for D2 MSNs cannot
be ruled out (Lobo et al., 2010) although, for the most part,
adaptations in D2 MSNs generally oppose addictive behaviors
(Lobo and Nestler, 2011).
CONCLUSIONS
Using a complex paradigm of cocaine use consisting of
repeated cycles of extinction/reinstatement, a model that
closely resembles the human condition, we demonstrate elec-
trophysiological neuroadaptations in NAc MSNs due to either
contingent (IVSA in master mice) or non-contingent (yoked
mice) administration. Changes after a long withdrawal period
were compartment specific while those occurring after acute
re-exposure to cocaine occurred in both core and shell. We
also demonstrate sensitized glutamate transmission of NAc
MSNs from master mice in response to acute cocaine ap-
plication and suggest a promising strategy to counter drug-
primed cocaine-seeking. Disruption of glutamatergic inputs
onto MSNs or blockade of glutamate receptors in NAc could
prevent relapse induced by drugs that have been previously
abused.
