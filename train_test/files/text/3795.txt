within 90 days of hospitalization for acute
exacerbations of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease: a longitudinal study

Abstract
Background: Readmission after hospital discharge is common in patients with acute
exacerbations (AE) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although frailty predicts
hospital readmission in patients with chronic nonpulmonary diseases, no multidimensional
frailty measures have been validated to stratify the risk for patients with COPD.
Aim: The aim of this study was to explore multidimensional frailty as a potential risk factor
for readmission due to a new exacerbation episode during the 90 days after hospitalization
for AE-COPD and to test whether frailty could improve the identification of patients at high
risk of readmission. We hypothesized that patients with moderate-to-severe frailty would be
at greater risk for readmission within that period of follow up. A secondary aim was to test
whether frailty could improve the accuracy with which to discriminate patients with a high risk
of readmission. Our investigation was part of a wider study protocol with additional aims on
the same study population.
Methods: Frailty, demographics, and disease-related factors were measured prospectively
in 102 patients during hospitalization for AE-COPD. Some of the baseline data reported
were collected as part of a previously study. Readmission data were obtained on the basis
of the discharge summary from patients' electronic files by a researcher blinded to the
measurements made in the previous hospitalization. The association between frailty and
readmission was assessed using bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression
models. Whether frailty better identifies patients at high risk for readmission was evaluated by
area under the receiver operator curve (AUC).
Results: Severely frail patients were much more likely to be readmitted than nonfrail
patients (45% versus 18%). After adjusting for age and relevant disease-related factors
in a final multivariate model, severe frailty remained an independent risk factor for 90-
day readmission (odds ratio = 5.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.26­21.50). Age, number of
hospitalizations for exacerbations in the previous year and length of stay were also significant
in this model. Additionally, frailty improved the predictive accuracy of readmission by
improving the AUC.
Conclusions: Multidimensional frailty predicts the risk of early hospital readmission in
patients hospitalized for AE-COPD. Frailty improved the accuracy of discriminating patients
at high risk for readmission. Identifying patients with frailty for targeted interventions may
reduce early readmission rates.

Introduction
Hospitalization for acute exacerbations (AE) of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
is common in Europe.1 These hospitalizations
account for about 10% of all acute medical admis-
sions1,2 and are associated with high readmission
rates within 90 days of discharge.3 Because of
their relevance for patients and health care costs,
preventing hospital readmissions has assumed
high political importance.4 In this respect, identi-
fying risk factors may help clinicians screen
patients at high risk of readmission then intervene
to effectively reduce that risk.5
Several predictive factors for hospital readmis-
sions of patients with COPD have been described,
including demographic (e.g. age, sex) and dis-
ease-related factors, as well as the severity and
activity [e.g. forced expiratory volume (FEV1
),
comorbidities, exacerbations in the past year] and
its impact on functional limitations (e.g. dysp-
noea, dependence).6­9 Recently, novel predictors
from the area of frailty have been researched and
several studies have suggested that impairments
in some measures of physical performance (e.g.
gait speed and physical activity), regarded as sur-
rogate markers of physical frailty may increase the
risk of readmission following hospitalizations
because of AE-COPD.8,10,11
Frailty has been proposed as a state of decreased
physiologic reserve, conferring increased vulner-
ability to stressors such as acute illness or hospi-
talization.12 Frailty is a multidimensional concept,
which often includes physical, psychological, and
social components.13 Some authors have identi-
fied multidimensional frailty as a predictor of hos-
pital readmission in patients with chronic
nonpulmonary diseases.14 However, the role of
frailty on readmissions following hospitalization
for AE-COPD has only been studied by means of
markers of physical frailty (e.g. gait speed).8,10,11
Because of the potential importance of frailty for
readmission following hospitalization, the effect
of frailty on readmissions because of AE-COPD
was examined using a tool based on a multidi-
mensional frailty model.15
The aim of this study was to explore multidimen-
sional frailty as a potential risk factor for readmis-
sion due to a new exacerbation episode during the
90 days after hospitalization for AE-COPD. A
secondary aim was to test whether frailty could
improve the accuracy with which to discriminate
patients with a high risk of readmission. Our
investigation was part of a wider study protocol
with additional aims to determine rate and time
course of functional changes on the same study
population which were already reported in a pre-
vious manuscript.16
Methods
Study design and participants
A prospective observational design was used.
During a 12-month period from February 2014,
patients hospitalized with exacerbations of their
COPD were prospectively recruited from acute
medical wards at Morales Meseguer Universitary
Hospital, Murcia (Spain) and followed during 90
days after their discharge. Inclusion criteria were
a diagnosis of COPD according to the Global
Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) guidelines,17 admission with a diagnosis
of AE-COPD as determined by the specialist res-
piratory team. Admission was defined as a medi-
cal ward stay of greater than 24 h duration and
AE was regarded according to GOLD defini-
tion,17 for example, `...an acute event character-
ized by a worsening of the patient's respiratory
symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day vari-
ations and leads to a change in medication.'
Potential participants were excluded based on the
following criteria: significant cognitive deficits
(i.e. Mini-mental State Examination score < 20),
a terminal illness (expected survival of <4
months) or inability to answer self-report ques-
tions. Some of the baseline data reported in this
article were collected as part of a previously pub-
lished study.16 All participants provided written
informed consent. The Hospital's Ethics
Committee approved this study (EST-35/13).
All patients received a minimum 7 days of oral
corticosteroids, and we treated with nebulized
bronchodilators. Antibiotics were given for pre-
sumed infective exacerbation at the judgement of
the clinical team.
Measurements
Frailty. Frailty was measured within 48­96 h of hos-
pital admission by means of the Reported Edmon-
ton Frail Scale (REFS).15 A research assistant with
no formal medical training administered the REFS.
The REFS samples nine domains; cognition, gen-
eral health status, functional independence, social
R Bernabeu-Mora, G García-Guillamón et al.

support, medication use, nutrition, mood, conti-
nence and self-reported performance.The REFS is
based on a scale from 0 to 18, with higher scores
entailing more severe frailty.15 Scores were catego-
rized into four predefined categories of `Not Frail or
Vulnerable' (0­7), `Mild Frailty' (8­9), `Moderate
Frailty' (10­11), and `Severe Frailty' (12­18). We
hypothesized that patients with moderate-to-severe
frailty would be at greater risk for readmission
within that period of follow up and that frailty could
improve the accuracy with which to discriminate
patients with a high risk of readmission. These
hypotheses were prespecified in the original study
protocol.
Hospital readmissions.Hospital readmissions for
a new AE between 30 and 90 days after hospital
discharge were selected (the 0­29-day interval was
not considered because some patients do not
recover completely until 4 weeks from exacerba-
tion).18 Readmission data were obtained on the
basis of the discharge summary from patients'
electronic files by a researcher blinded to the mea-
surements made in the previous hospitalization.
Demographic and disease-related variables.A
total of 14 demographic and disease-related vari-
ables were selected, based on a search of the lit-
erature as covariates based on their potential
association with either the readmission following
hospitalization for AE-COPD5­7,9 or with frailty
COPD.12,13,19 The demographic variables
included age (years), sex and living with partner/
spouse (yes/no). Disease-related variables were
classified into three domains related to activity,
severity and impact of disease.20 The activity
domain included smoking status (being an active
smoker or not), history of smoking as pack years,
number of hospitalizations because of exacerba-
tions in the previous year and body mass index
[BMI (kg/m2)]. The severity domain included
FEV1
, requiring non-invasive ventilation during
hospitalization, length of stay in the hospital
(days), number of comorbidities measured using
the Functional Comorbidity Index21 and coexis-
tent cardiovascular comorbidity (yes/no). Finally,
the impact domain included the modified Medi-
cal Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale
and dependence. All these disease factors, except
dependence, were acquired from electronic files
either during hospitalization or at discharge.
Dependence was measured after 48­96 h of hos-
pital admission by means of an activities-of-daily-
living (ADL) scale as described elsewhere.22
Being unable to perform an ADL or requiring the
help of another person for any ADL was self-
reported.The score range for this scale (0­6) was
based on the number of dependencies, with a
score of 6 representing dependencies in all ADLs.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize
participant characteristics. We used analysis of
variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal Wallis to examine
differences in baseline characteristics with respect
to the ranges of frailty. For comparing categorical
characteristics between readmitted and not read-
mitted patients, we used Pearson 2 or Fisher's
exact test if numbers were low. Between-group
differences were assessed using the independent t
test or Mann­Whitney U tests (if non-normally
distributed data) for continuous variables.
A univariate logistic regression and a trend analy-
sis were used to assess the association between
frailty and readmission within 90 days after hospi-
talization. Additionally, two separate multivariate
models were first fit for demographics and
domains related to activity, severity and impact of
disease by including those in each domain that
showed a statistically significant association (p <
0.15) as independent variables in previous binary
analyses with either readmission or frailty. The
first model (Model 1) contained frailty as well as
demographics and variables concerning activity
domains of disease. Model 2 contained frailty and
variables concerning severity and impact domains.
A final multivariate logistic regression model was
chosen by including the most strongly predictive
factors from each of the individual models. All
multivariate models were produced using the
backwards stepwise method and variables
remained in the model if p < 0.10. Goodness-of-
fit and regression diagnostics for the models were
assessed using methods described elsewhere.23
The interaction between frailty and those varia-
bles that remained in the final model (age, length
of stay and number of exacerbations) were con-
sidered in that final model; however, no modifica-
tions were found and therefore subgroup analyses
were not performed.
Two methods were used to assess and quantify
whether frailty could improve the accuracy of the
ability to discriminate patients with early read-
mission. First, we constructed receiver-operating
characteristic (ROC) curves with the predicted
Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 11(10)
386 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar
probabilities from the final multivariate model,
with and without frailty, and calculated their area
under the curve (AUC). We used the overall dif-
ference between the two AUCs to determine
whether frailty added discriminative value.
Second, we selected the best cut-off points of
each ROC and calculated the sensitivity (Se),
specificity (Sp), positive (LR+) and negative
(LR-) likelihood ratios. Cut-off points were
defined as the value at which Se + Sp - 1 was
maximized.
No a priori sample size calculation was done for
these specific analyses, beyond that performed in
the original study protocol, which was based on
the rule of thumb that 15 subjects per predictor
are needed for a reliable equation in multiple
regression models.24 All analyses were performed
with the SPSS statistical software program (SPSS
version 19.0; IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, US).
Results
Patient characteristics
Of the 107 patients hospitalized with COPD
exacerbations, four were excluded because they
had a length of stay > 30 days. Therefore, 103
patients were included at baseline. After 90 days
of follow up after hospital discharge, 102 (99%)
participated in the study; one participant with
severe frailty died. At baseline, we had only five
(4.85%) missing values in the variable smoking
history by pack years and three (2.91%) missing
for dyspnoea.
Baseline characteristics of patients as a whole,
and stratified by subgroups of frailty are shown in
Table 1. The mean [standard deviation (SD)] age
of the total sample was 71.0 (9.1) years. The sam-
ple was predominantly male and evenly split
between patients living or not with a partner/
spouse. A total of 34% were still smoking. The
more frequent comorbidities were diabetes
(29%), cardiovascular disease (27.2%) and upper
gastrointestinal disease (20%). The means (SD)
of the ADL dependence and frailty scores were
1.4 (1.9) and 8.0 (3.3), respectively.
A total of 46 participants were `Not frail or
Vulnerable' (44.7%), 20 (19.4%) had `Mild
frailty,' 18 (17.5%) `Moderate frailty,' and 19
(18.4%) `Severe frailty.' Participants with moder-
ate-to-severe frailty at hospital admission had
significantly more exacerbations in the previous
year, higher comorbidity burden, worse respira-
tory disability (MRC), and a higher number of
dependencies (Table 1). No significant differ-
ences nor correlation were found between frailty
groups and severity by FEV1
(data not showed).
Frailty and readmission
In total, 32 of the 102 patients (31.4%) were read-
mitted for AE within 90 days of hospital discharge.
Baseline characteristics of those readmitted and
not readmitted within 90 days are compared in
Table 2. Participants who were readmitted were
older, more likely to be nonsmokers, had higher
MRC dyspnoea scores, a greater number of hospi-
talizations because of AEs in the previous year,
comorbidities and dependencies than those who
were not readmitted.
Figure 1 shows readmission rates according to
categories of frailty. The risk of 90-day readmis-
sion increased as frailty increased (`Not frail or
Vulnerable' 21.7%, `Mild frailty' 25.0%,
`Moderate frailty' 27.8%, `Severe frailty' 66.7%;
ptrend
= 0.002).
The first unadjusted model shown in Table 3 pro-
vides a relative measure of the odds of having a
readmission for AE within 90 days of hospital dis-
charge between participants with different levels
of frailty with respect to no frailty. According to
this model, the odds of readmission increased sig-
nificantly only when patients had severe frailty
[odds ratio (OR) = 7.20, 95% confidence inter-
val (CI): 2.16­24.0, p = 0.001]. These effect esti-
mates were slightly decreased after adjusting for
demographic and disease-related covariates in all
the multivariate models, but frailty persisted and
remained statistically significant. In the final
model, which also included demographic as well
as disease-related variables, frailty remained an
independent risk factor for 90-day readmission
(OR = 5.19; 95% CI: 1.26­21.50). Among the
covariates, only age, hospitalizations because of
AE in the previous year and length stay were
retained. All explained the higher percentage of
variance for 90-day readmissions (45.5%).
Accuracy with which to discriminate patients at
high risk of readmission

hospital readmission within 90 days. The AUC
was higher with the addition of frailty (0.831 ver-
sus 0.782) to the three demographic and disease-
related factors included in the final model (Table
3), implying that frailty adds value as a predic-
tive factor.
The cut-off scores yielded the most accurate dis-
crimination of patients with high readmission
risk, which were 24% for the full model and 27%
for the model without frailty. Frailty also improved
the accuracy of classifying patients using these
optimal cut-off points. The sensitivity, specificity,
and likelihood ratios calculated for these cut-off
points are shown in Table 4.
Discussion
In this study, we aimed to minimize possible con-
founders between frailty and readmissions by
controlling for key demographic and disease-
related factors. Frailty was a relevant and inde-
pendent risk factor for readmission within 90
days following hospitalization because of AE in
patients with COPD, even after accounting for
risk factors. Patients with severe frailty

experienced about five times more readmissions
than nonfrail patients. Furthermore, we also
demonstrated that frailty significantly improved
the accuracy with which to discriminate patients
at an increased risk of readmission when added to
those relevant risk factors.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies
showing that frailty is an independent predictor of
hospital readmission in patients with chronic
nonpulmonary diseases and transplant recipi-
ents.12,25,26 Nevertheless, to our knowledge this is
the first study to test whether frailty, as defined by
the REFS, predicts readmission in patients hospi-
talized with AE-COPD. A few previous studies
have also suggested that some markers of frailty
(e.g. gait speed and physical activity) may increase
the risk of readmission in these patients.8,10
However, these studies did not define frailty as a

multidimensional construct and examined only
markers of the physical frailty dimension. Our
study extends these findings, showing that a mul-
tidimensional model of frailty is also a predictor
of readmissions.
In this study, we explored together the relative
importance of frailty and multiple known factors
related to readmission. We used multivariate
analysis to control covariates of the frailty index.
Moreover, only the factors with statistically sig-
nificant contributions concerning both the expo-
sure (frailty status) and the outcome measure
(readmission) were entered and combined. The
disease-related factors, number of hospitaliza-
tions because of exacerbations in the previous
year and length of stay and age were consistently
associated with readmission. Therefore, it seems
reasonable to conclude that the occurrence of
readmission within 90 days after hospital dis-
charge is a complex and multifactorial process
mediated by both the patients' disease-related
status and their frailty. Surprisingly, other known
disease-related factors (e.g. smoking status,
requiring non-invasive ventilation, cardiovascular
comorbidity, and functional dependence) did not
differentiate themselves as predictors of readmis-
sion, which is somewhat contrary to the published
literature.5­9 A possible reason explaining these
findings is that these variables were added to the
models, along with other factors that were rela-
tively more significant to readmissions.

The predictors identified in the final model were
shown to demonstrate good accuracy (with a very
good AUC) in discriminating between patients
with COPD with and without readmission fol-
lowing hospitalization because of an AE.
Nevertheless, we found the AUC to be similar to
previous prognostic studies that did not use a
multidimensional measure of frailty,8 therefore,
our study did not provide a substantially better
prognostic model. However, our study highlights
that frailty adds value to well-known disease-
related factors in the accuracy for predicting read-
missions. This is a valuable finding that supports
including the measurement of REFS in the clini-
cal setting, where it may be useful to have a meas-
ure of frailty but where there may not be time to
perform a performance-based test (i.e. gait speed)
or when patients are unable to perform these tests
(i.e. walk 5 meters independently).
The real value of the findings on frailty presented
here is that it provides a strategy for targeting
interventions aimed at patients in most need (i.e.
frail patients) and to reduce readmission rates.
Because frailty is potentially reversible by pulmo-
nary rehabilitation in patients with lung disease,27
targeting frail hospitalized patients with a high
risk of readmission might be a determinant
for preventing readmissions. Table 4 provides
information needed to estimate the probability
that a patient having a specific age, length of stay,
number of hospitalizations and frailty level will be
readmitted within 90 days after hospital dis-
charge. However, in our opinion, there may be a
larger benefit in implementing readmission pre-
vention programs in patients with COPD and
moderate-to-severe frailty living in the commu-
nity rather than only in hospitalized patients.
Simple, combined interventions such as nutri-
tional, physical, and cognitive training were effec-
tiveinreversingfrailtyamongcommunity-dwelling
older people.27
Our study has several limitations. First, because
this was a single-centre study and only a few
females were included in the cohort, generaliza-
tion of the results to women or other clinical set-
tings should be made with caution. Data on
postacute rehabilitation services were lacking.
Nevertheless, we know that rehabilitation services
were not widely used by the patients as reported in
other studies.28 Second, patients with cognitive
deficits may be frailer and their exclusion may bias
the results. Our decision to exclude them was
based on the fact that self-reporting measures are
limited amongst these individuals. Third, it may
be speculated that other factors not included in
the final model could improve it (e.g. having a
close follow-up visit, postdischarge treatment,
psychosocial factors, hypercapnia, Long term

oxygen therapy (LTOT) prescription). Fourth,
we present a prognostic model that successfully
predicted readmission, but this model should be
validated in other populations to provide evidence
that the model performs well. Finally, we used
only severe AEs with readmission and did not use
other AEs. Because readmissions are very relevant
for patients and healthcare costs, our research
question was centered on them. Future studies are
needed that analyse a more representative sample
including females and patients with different
degrees of AE severity from several hospitals or
other healthcare systems. However, we believe
that the recruiting hospital was typical of many
other Spanish hospitals, and the observed read-
mission rates were similar to those seen in previ-
ous studies.3,8
In conclusion, frailty is an independent predictor
of readmission within 90 days following hospitali-
zation for AE in patients with COPD. This meas-
ure of physiologic reserve is predictive of early
hospital readmissions for AE regardless of age and
factors related to activity, severity and the impact
of the COPD. Accuracy to discriminate which
patients are at high risk of readmission is improved
by frailty, which may allow high-risk patients to be
identified at the time of hospitalization. Identifying
patients with severe frailty or high risk of readmis-
sion that could be targeted for rehabilitation pro-
grams prior to or after hospitalization could reduce
the very high rates of early readmission seen after
hospitalization for AE-COPD.
