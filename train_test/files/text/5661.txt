Introduction
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), characterized as glu-
cose intolerance firstly occurring or recognized during
pregnancy, is an important public health problem world-
wide.1,2 In China, the incidence increased during 1999­
2013, from 2.4% to 12.1%.3,4 Women with GDM possess
high risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes and several
maternal and perinatal complications, including neonatal
hypoglycemia and adiposity, metabolic syndrome and
future diabetes mellitus.5­9 Regarding risk factors for GDM,
several environmental triggers have been identified so far,
such as obesity, poor diet and physical inactivity.10­12 In
addition, genetic components have also been reported to
contribute to the development of GDM.13­15
Adiponectin (ADIPOQ) is a protein hormone involved
in regulating glucose levels and fatty acid oxidation.16,17
The hormone plays a key role in the metabolic derange-
ments that may lead to type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis,
obesity, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.16,18­20
The ADIPOQ gene, located on chromosome 3q27 in
humans, contains three exons. A single nucleotide

Abstract
Introduction: Adiponectin (ADIPOQ), involved in regulating glucose levels and fatty acid oxidation, plays key roles in
metabolic derangements such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Previously, several studies have been conducted to
assess the association between ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and risk of GDM. The results, however, are inconclusive.
We aimed to evaluate the effect of the polymorphism on the risk of GDM using a meta-analysis.
Materials and methods: After databases searching, eight records were identified. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with
their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the association between ADIPOQ +45 T/G
polymorphism and risk of GDM.
Results: No significant association was observed between the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and the risk of GDM
(heterozygote comparison: OR = 1.15, 95% CI, 0.70­1.89; homozygote comparison: OR = 1.21, 95% CI, 0.48­3.03;
dominant model: OR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.50­1.48, recessive model: OR = 1.21, 95% CI, 0.62­2.33, and allele comparison:
OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 0.79­1.76, respectively). Apparent heterogeneity was detected. However, no evidence of publication
bias was found.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence that the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism was not related to the
risk of GDM. Further multicenter, prospective studies with larger sample size would be valuable to confirm the result.

rs2241766) may influence the protein expression by affect-
ing RNA splicing and stability.21 The SNP has been shown
to be related to type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.22­24
Given the potential role of the ADIPOQ +45 T/G poly-
morphism in diabetes, several association studies have
been conducted to assess the association between the poly-
morphism and risk of GDM.25­32 The results, however, are
inconsistent and inconclusive. For example, Takhshid
et al. reported that the TG/GG genotypes had a 2.55-fold
increased risk of GDM compared with the TT genotype,31
whereas Beltcheva et al. reported that no association with
GDM was found for the polymorphism.25 One reason for
the conflicting results is small samples in a single study.
Meta-analysis is a useful tool to increase power by pooling
all the published data together. In this study, we performed
a meta-analysis to clarify whether the ADIPOQ +45 T/G
polymorphism is associated with the risk of GDM.
Materials and methods
Records selection
PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Weipu
and Wangfang databases were searched using the following
terms: "ADIPOQ or adiponectin" and "polymorphism* or
variant" and "gestational diabetes mellitus" or "Gestational
diabetes" (last search update October 30, 2015). Forty-one
articles were identified after database searching. We selected
publications using the following criteria: (a) studies evaluat-
ing the association between ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymor-
phism and the risk of GDM; (b) original genotyping data to
compute pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
interval (CI); (c) language was not restricted. Among them,
18 articles were removed for duplicate publication. After
full-text assessment, 12 articles were excluded for these rea-
sons: no ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism (n = 8), reviews
(n = 3), and not a study of GDM (n = 1). During data collec-
tion, we excluded three articles for repeated data. Finally,
eight studies were included in this meta-analysis. A flow
diagram of studies selection is presented in Figure 1.
Data extraction
The following information was extracted by two research-
ers independently: author, year of publication, country
(origin), ethnicity, study design, number of cases and con-
trols, matching criteria, genotyping method, and minor
allele frequency in controls. The information was checked
by a third researcher to confirm the accuracy.
Statistical analysis
The association between the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymor-
phism and the risk of GDM was evaluated by pooled ORs
and their 95% CI under a heterozygote comparison,
homozygote comparison, dominant model, recessive
model, and allele comparison. A fixed-effects model was
used to estimate summary ORs because p values for het-
erogeneity test were  0.10 in all comparison analyses.33
To identify the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analy-
ses were performed based on the Hardy-Weinberg equilib-
rium (HWE) and sample size (>100 vs. 100). Logistic
meta-regression was also performed according to ethnic-
ity, genotyping methods, HWE, and sample size. Begg's
funnel plot was used to test publication bias.34 All analyses
were conducted using STATA software (version 10.0,
STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Characteristics of studies
The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table
1. In total, eight studies were included in this meta-analysis
with 875 cases and 884 controls.Among them, seven studies
were of Asian descendants26­32 and one study was of
European descendants.25 The sample sizes were relatively
small in all the studies, with the least having 79 participants30
and the most having 436 participants.28 Most of the studies
(62.5%) reported a matched frequency of controls to
cases.25,27,29,31,32 Several genotyping methods were used,
including TaqMan, polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and DNA
sequencing. However, only two studies reported quality con-
trol to ensure the reproducibility of the genotyping assay.25,31
Most of the studies (75.0%) were consistent with HWE
except for one study departing from HWE27 and one study
without available data to assess HWE.25 Minor allele fre-
quency in controls varied greatly, ranging from 0.10 to 0.49.

(Figure 2). After excluding two studies with Hardy-
Weinberg disequilibrium, no significant association was
found. Additionally, we performed subgroup analysis
according to sample size (> 100 and 100); negative results
were also observed in both subgroups.
Heterogeneity analysis and publication bias.In overall and
subgroup analyses, we detected apparent heterogeneity
(p  0.10). Logistic meta-regression was used to explore
the sources of heterogeneity. We took the common variables
influencing heterogeneity into consideration: ethnicity, gen-
otyping methods, HWE, and sample size. However, none of
these factors affected the heterogeneity among studies.
Begg's funnel plot was used to test publication bias, and
no evidence of publication bias was found (p > 0.05) in the
meta-analysis (Figure 3).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis
to investigate the relationship of the ADIPOQ +45 T/G pol-
ymorphism with GDM. We failed to find any association
between the SNP and the risk of GDM, suggesting that the
ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism may not be a risk factor
for the etiology of GDM.
Previously, several SNPs have been performed to eval-
uate the association with GDM, such as rs2241766
(Gly15Gly, +45 T/G) in exon 2, rs266729 (-11377 C/G)
and rs17300539 (-11391G/A) in the promoter region, and
rs1501299 (+276 G/T) in intron 2.25­32 Among them, the
ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism is the most frequently
investigated. Controversial results, however, have been
obtained. In this study, we collected all previous publica-
tions and performed a meta-analysis to assess the associa-
tion of the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism with the risk
of GDM. Our meta-analysis provided evidence that the
polymorphism was not a risk factor for the development of
GDM although 75% (six of eight) studies reported a posi-
tive result.26,27,29­32 After subgroup analysis according to
HWE and sample size, null results were also observed.
Obvious heterogeneity was detected among studies. We
used logistic meta-regression to examine the sources of het-
erogeneity based on ethnicity, genotyping methods, HWE,
and sample size. None of these parameters could explain the
heterogeneity, indicating that other unknown reasons may
influence the heterogeneity. As most of the studies previ-
ously reported a significant association between the
ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism and susceptibility for
GDM, in this meta-analysis we used Begg's funnel plot to
test if there is a tendency of prior publication positive results.
However, no evidence of publication bias was found.
These are some limitations in this study. Firstly, sample
size is very small in each single study as well as in this
meta-analysis, which may result in false-negative result
due to insufficient power. Secondly, very limited data in the
Xu et al. 5
literature reported the association between the ADIPOQ
+45 T/G polymorphism and serum adiponectin level, which
prevented further genotype-phenotype analysis. Thirdly,
nearly all the studies included in this meta-analysis were of
Asian descendants, and thus the results cannot be directly
extended to other ethnicities. Further evaluation is war-
ranted, especially in multi-ethnic populations.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that
the ADIPOQ +45 T/G polymorphism was not related to
the risk of GDM. Further multicenter, prospective studies
with larger sample size would be of great value to confirm
the result. Additionally, gene-gene and genotype-pheno-
type analysis may help to comprehensively understand the
role of the SNP in the etiology of GDM.
