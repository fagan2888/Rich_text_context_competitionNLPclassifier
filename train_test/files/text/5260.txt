Introduction
Intractable neurological diseases are defined as those of
unknown etiology that have no established method of treat-
ment. This includes motor neuron diseases such as amyo-
trophic lateral sclerosis, spinocerebellar degeneration,
multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, and multiple
sclerosis. Most of these diseases are progressive and ulti-
mately prevent patients from living independently.
Individuals often feel that their life is not worth living when
they are diagnosed or when their condition progresses
(Toombs, 1993).
Policy and Practice for Intractable
Neurological Disease in Japan
The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare
(MHLW) has supported policies aimed at intractable dis-
eases since 1973. This effort has the following goals: (a) to
promote research, (b) to develop and maintain appropriate
health care facilities, (c) to reduce the burden of self-health
care costs, (d) to expand and improve available health care
by working with affiliated organizations and institutions, and
(e) to promote measures to improve the quality of life (QOL)
of individuals with 1 of the 27 neurological diseases included
(Japanese Intractable Diseases Information Centre, n.d.-a).
The health care facilities of interest are long-term care
and acute hospitals, advanced treatment hospitals, and
research institutes. People with intractable neurological dis-
eases may be living in one of these facilities or at home.
However, patients in advanced treatment hospitals or acute
care hospitals may not receive long-term care. Such hospitals
treat patients and educate health care professionals, but do
not have the facilities or abilities necessary for long-term
care. Thus, these hospitals are generally used for diagnoses,
treatment of acute symptoms, and outpatient care.
Japanese researchers have recently begun to address
patient experience, enhancement of home care systems, and
welfare development. "Welfare" refers to a social movement
that provides basic physical and material well-being and
financial support for these patients (Japanese Intractable
Diseases Information Centre, n.d.,-b, MHLW). Previous
studies reported that nurses caring for patients with intracta-
ble neurological diseases may be conflicted, but the reason
for this is unclear. One possibility is that these nurses may

Neurological Diseases

Abstract
This is a qualitative descriptive study examining nurses' attitudes about caring for patients with intractable neurological
diseases, with a focus on dedication and conflicts. Semistructured interviews were conducted on 11 nurses with more than 5
years of clinical experience in addition to more than 3 years of experience in neurology wards. Senior nursing officers from
each hospital selected the participants. In general, these nurses expressed distress over the inevitable progression of disease.
Nurses talked about the "basis of dedication," "conflicts with dedication," "reorganization for maintaining dedication," and
"the reason for the change from conflict to commitment." "Reorganization for maintaining dedication" meant that nurses
were able to handle the prospect of rededicating themselves to their patients. Furthermore, "the reason for the change
from conflict to commitment" referred to events that changed nurses' outlooks on nursing care, their pride as nurses, or
their learning experiences. They felt dedicated and conflicted both simultaneously and separately. While committing to their
patients' physical care, nurses were empowered to think positively and treat patients with dignity in spite of the care taking
much time and effort, as well as entailing considerable risk.

feel a sense of powerlessness due to the gap between the
ideal situation and reality.
Professionalization of Nurses
Why do nurses go through conflicts in caring for these
patients? Professionalization of nursing might be one reason.
According to Sandelowski (2000), nurses claimed to be pro-
fessionals because they introduced and used devices and new
technology; this change altered nurses' position of providing
"tender loving care." However, nurses who care for patients
with intractable neurological diseases do not use devices or
new technology. Therefore, there is no doubt that their work
is truly nursing.
While nursing may also involve spiritual care, many nurses
in Japan do not understand the concept of spirituality (Nagase
et al., 2013). In certain functional or acute care hospitals, nurses
who care for patients with intractable neurological diseases
may be aware that their patients suffer from spiritual distress.
However, they may believe that it is unnecessary or inappropri-
ate to provide "spiritual care." Rather, they are committed to
helping patients execute activities of daily living (ADLs).
By the late 1980s in the United States, despite historically
high salaries, multithousand dollar signing bonuses, wide-
open career ladders, work that produced immediately tangi-
ble results, great opportunities for learning, and visual
guarantees of employment for nurses who wanted to work,
nearly one third of the registered nurses in the United States
were not practicing nursing (Reverby, 1987). Part of the rea-
son may lie in the inherent contradiction of being "ordered to
care," which means that emotional work, usually spontane-
ous, is a required part of the job. Smith (1992) categorized
nursing as emotional labor.
Outcomes of Research in Social Science
Many theorists and researchers have addressed the issues of
health, illness, well-being, suffering, and caring. Galvin and
Todres (2013) attempted to show how a personal philosophy
toward life and research can offer valuable ways to approach
the relationship of health-related caring and well-being. The
lifeworld concept is used in philosophy and in some social
sciences, particularly sociology. An important and central
theme of work of Galvin and Todres is caring for well-being,
which refers to providing specific and delineated directions
for care. "Directions for care" means providing resources to
ensure the well-being of a patient based on symptoms and
disease progression.
The work of nurses has been described as both dirty and
good. McMurray (2011) considered what happened when
nurses established specific roles and hierarchically organized
professional divisions. Charting the struggles of a group of
advanced nurse practitioners, the article considered the ways
in which claims to license, place, and mandate are employed
to negotiate new occupational places. In a departure from
situations that place managerialism and entrepreneurialism
above professionalism, the article showed how the executive
authority that comes with entrepreneurial ownership could
bolster professionalizing claims, thus disrupting and revers-
ing hierarchically organized professional divisions. In addi-
tion, Simpson, Slutskaya, Lewis, and Höpfl, 2012) described
the complexity, fluidity, and contingency of dirty work--
how occupational boundaries, work practices, and the mean-
ings associated with dirt and cleanliness are accordingly
more fluid and subject to reinterpretation and change, rather
than being fixed, stable, and rooted in a job task--in addition
to how individuals manage and construct the "clean/dirty"
divide and how dirty workers negotiate taint in the manage-
ment of identity.
Mission
In the present article, we analyzed the narratives of 11 nurses.
Despite what was reported by Nagase et al. (2013) regarding
the spiritual distress of patients and the nurse's role in pro-
viding spiritual care, the nurses interviewed spoke eloquently
of their own nursing care, beliefs, policies, and so on. In the
study by Nagase et al., researchers believed that nurses pro-
vided spiritual care and could talk about their own spiritual
care; however, the nurses said that they did not provide spiri-
tual care that patients evidently needed.
We used these data (Nagase et al., 2013) to clarify nurses'
differing levels of dedication and conflict. We clarified that
nursing is a professional occupation even without the use of
new technology. In this study, we define nurses' dedication
as their strong love, care, and support for patients and their
families, as well as the expenditure of time or energy. In
addition, we define nurses' conflict as a situation in which
there are opposing ideas, opinions, feelings, or wishes on
nursing care for patients with intractable neurological dis-
eases in acute hospital setting.
Method
Semistructured interviews using our own interview guide
were conducted during this qualitative descriptive study. To
date, little research has focused on nursing for patients with
intractable neurological diseases in acute care hospitals. The
questions addressed to participants fell into the following
categories: the value of nursing, the patient's distress, and
what they did and felt at work. We also asked what, based on
their impressions and experiences, were the most important
parts of treating patients and whether they experienced any
internal conflicts. Individual interviews were conducted in a
quiet private room to protect privacy. One interviewer con-
ducted and recorded the interviews, which were then tran-
scribed. The transcripts were then analyzed by four
researchers. The interviews lasted approximately 60 to 90
min per person, and took place between August 2011 and
March 2012.
Before the interview, we explained the purpose of the
study, the methods, and ethical considerations, after which
Nagase et al. 3
each participant gave written consent. A withdrawal form
was also distributed in advance for participants who might
wish to leave the study after the interview. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee for the Faculty of Health
Care and Nursing, Juntendo University. The mention of the
transcripts was anonymized, and the transcripts will be
destroyed after the end of this study.
We interviewed 11 nurses with experience in caring for
patients with neurological intractable diseases; each had
more than 5 years of clinical experience in addition to more
than 3 years of experience in neurology wards. The senior
nursing officer at each hospital was asked to select the par-
ticipants. While the right to withdraw was offered, no partici-
pant withdrew from the study. In addition, two acute care
hospitals and three wards were involved.
We collected data through interviews and performed a
continuous comparative analysis of the data as they were
obtained.
Results
The nurses had worked for 6 to 20 years as a nurse and for 6
to 9 years of experience in a neurology ward. Five of all par-
ticipants had cared for only patients with brain or neurologi-
cal diseases. The remaining five nurses of all had worked in
a mixed ward, including ophthalmology, orthopedics, and
neurology facilities.
They talked about "the basis of dedication," "the conflict
with dedication," "reorganization for maintaining dedica-
tion," and "the reason for the change from conflict to com-
mitment" (see Table 1). They experienced dedication and
conflict both simultaneously and separately.
The Basis of Dedication
Commitment to Patient Hope
Nurses are aware that intractable neurological diseases grad-
ually reduce the ability of patients to perform ADLs and ulti-
mately render them unable to live independently. One
participant said, "There is limited time left for the patient and
his family. That's why we hope they value every minute of
the here and now." They thought that patients and their fami-
lies should concentrate on the positive aspects of the
situation.
It was often too difficult to provide disabled patients with
the level of personal care that allows proper performance of
ADLs. Time and physical effort is necessary to fully support
and care for these patients. For example, when a patient
wants to sit in a chair, the nurses do not simply transfer him
or her from the bed to a chair. Nurses must manage this trans-
fer safely while keeping the patient comfortable. By moving
to a chair, the patient can better talk with others, draw a pic-
ture, read a book, or use a computer. Thus, the nurses help
their patients with intractable neurological diseases to live
life with dignity. However, they said that there are not enough
personnel to provide sufficient support to maintain the QOL
of patients.
Pride in Their Own Nursing
All participants mentioned that they thought of the nursing
profession as more than just caring. One of the participants
expressed the following: "Our nursing care allows patients to
improve their conditions. Improvement in the quality of life
is the outcome of nurses' care, because nursing care is based
on nursing assessment."
Nursing care is also about recognizing the patient's pre-
ferred lifestyle and supporting that way of life and their val-
ues. Participants mentioned that nurses to help patients meet
the needs of daily life. The work is hard but also challenging
and rewarding. The reason behind the nurses' comments is
their belief that nurses are health care professionals. The
majority stated, "Because we are nurses, we provide care on
the basis of evidence and think that we should do our best."
Promoting the Progress of Recovery
Participants stated that an underlying belief in nursing care is
that neurological function will be restored and that nursing
care will use wisdom and innovative ideas to assist in the
recovery of the function. If nurses do not perform their
duties, patients'physical abilities will rapidly decrease; how-
ever, if nurses empower their patients, the patients may be
able to live independently for much longer, which would
promote patients' QOL. Nurses are deeply concerned about
having a negative impact on patients' QOL, such as causing

functional deterioration, making the patient bedridden, or
causing further disability.
Therefore, many of the participants may feel remorse-
ful after working with patients to accept their disease and
condition. The following quote is an example of such
remorse:
I thought that there might have been a better way to do it. For
example, it might have been better if we had worked in
collaboration with the physical therapists more, or if we had
asked a doctor for an adjustment of the medication. That way,
just maybe, she [the patient] could walk now . . . but we need
much more time, I think . . .
The Conflict With Dedication
Difficulty in Sustaining Interest in Patients
Nurses who care for patients with intractable neurological
diseases use a great deal of time and energy. Doing all this
work alone leads to burnout. One participant said, "If you
work in that ward long-term, or for a long time, you will lose
your mind." This was her concern; however, she also men-
tioned that nurses are emotionally wounded when the dignity
of their patient is not protected.
You think about how drastically the patient's life is altered when
he or she becomes unable to use the bathroom or to eat in
everyday life . . . to provide care is such an unglamorous task . .
. when you're changing diapers 30-odd times during a night
shift, you just wonder what you're doing . . . you think to
yourself, "What am I doing with my life?" . . . but, as difficult as
it may be to merely change diapers or take a patient to the
bathroom, I think you have to remember how important such
care is. Providing nursing care for patients with intractable
neurological diseases is a really unglamorous task, and it's not at
all dramatic . . . it really wears you down. (I know this might be
wrong, but) I honestly think I can empathize well with family
members who engage in abuse. For family members, care is a
24-hr job. If someone were to tell me, "You must stay in the
ward for 24 hours," I would quit. Without a doubt . . . so, in other
words, I'm up to my neck in working in this ward . . . when a
patient's human dignity, for example going to the bathroom or
eating, is threatened, it throws his or her psyche out of kilter, and
takes a toll on us staff, too . . . if a patient says, "I want to go to
the bathroom, but I can't" or "If I can't even go to the bathroom,
I don't want to live," it's understandable. But, when the patient
makes a nurse call saying "I want to go to the bathroom" on an
hourly basis, and you have to take the same patient to the
bathroom over 10 times each night, you get driven to the point
of insanity.
Some nurses were seriously worried about not making a
commitment to the patient and had a guilty conscience.
These narratives refer to it (being difficult to sustain an inter-
est in patients).
Powerlessness or Impatience
Participants said that it was difficult for patients to under-
stand that intractable neurological diseases are unlike cancer.
In the case of cancer patients, nurses can relieve pain and
other symptoms, and prepare for the patient's death.
However, in the case of patients with intractable neurological
diseases, the patient and their families, and even nurses and
physicians do not necessarily have to immediately deal with
the prospect of the patient's death. The patients try to stay
alive as long as possible and do not give up on the possibility
of further treatment, which can add to the time and energy
spent by nurses in caring for these patients.
Some of all participants also mentioned feeling helpless
about slowing the progression of the disease or preventing
the development of symptoms. Relapses disappoint patients
and nurses.
"I can no longer do things (for instance, walk, eat, sit during the
day, so on). Even though I want to go to the toilet, my legs don't
move! Then I don't want to keep living" one patient says. But
these demands are a patient's right and they deserve dignity. So,
we say to patients, "Shall we go to the toilet?" But it is very
difficult work, and we are driven almost to the brink if a nurse
call for needing the bathroom sounds every hour or 10 times a
night. It is just what does really the truth. Exactly!
However, one participant said, "Nurses in other wards say
that nursing care should be rationed because of a limited
workforce and time." They do not understand the point of
care and do not think that such care requires a professional.
This may be because they are in acute care hospitals, where
medical care requires the use of new technologies. "I often
feel bereft," said one participant.
Hesitation to Perform the Work
Caring for patients with intractable neurological diseases
makes nursing students feel good. However, the students
obtain a nursing qualification and begin to work with neuro-
logical patients, and the pleasure fades drastically. They
work desperately for the first few years instead of thinking
about better care. They mature as a nurse, and begin to doubt
whether the work they are doing is actually nursing. "I
couldn't believe that our work is nursing when I was an inex-
perienced nurse," some of the participants said.
In the first few years on the job, new nurses are working
frantically instead of thinking about providing better care.
After several years, many nurses begin to experience doubts
about whether they made the right professional choice.
Many complain that their responsibilities seem more similar
to a care worker than a nurse. There is a national qualifica-
tion in Japan for "care workers." Care workers assist with
the daily life of the older people and disabled, but they are
not involved in health care. Thus, while some of their work
Nagase et al. 5
overlaps that of nurses, care workers are not officially pro-
fessional nurses.
Reorganization for Maintaining
Dedication
Considering the Division of Roles Between Staff
Nurses
The participants in this study were all expert nurses. Their
difficult work was made easier by younger nurses providing
some of the necessary care for ADLs. "Younger nurses have
such patients (seriously ill patients), and older nurses can
take care of other seriously ill patients," some participants
said, in addition to, "it wasn't as difficult and tough because
of the younger nurses."
Information Sharing
Nurses share information regarding patient's care and cur-
rent conditions. Some of the participants said, "We want to
take care of any important needs for the patient."
When each of the nurses understands the patient's needs, a lot of
time isn't required for nursing care, and we have less stress. The
chief nurse is informed about the patient's needs and demands
from staff nurses and shares how to care for the patient. We have
conferences for such things.
Controlling Emotions
Nurses are dedicated to patients but not overly committed.
Participants said that they were able to shift certain emo-
tional gears to keep from feeling depressed or bereft.
Reasons for the Change From Conflict
to Commitment
Encounters With Many Patients
Participants met many patients with intractable neurological
diseases and some of these patients became aware of the
amount of work required.
At first, I wasn't particularly concerned about patients with ALS
(Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). The reason is, I was a less
experienced nurse, I think.After I gained experience and became
in charge of some ALS patients, the experience let me notice
their suffering or hope. It's something that I understood only
after I've been experiencing it.
Furthermore, participants commented that patients with
intractable neurological diseases have survived and are often
determined to defeat the illness. The reason for this is not
clear, but the participants feel full of vitality or passion
within the patients' own.
For example . . . if a patient catches pneumonia, physicians try
to give him treatment for as long as necessary. I thought it's just
that. But the people who expect treatment are really the patient
and his/her family. That's to say, the patient and his/her family
prefer to get treatment rather than give up . . . I have been
thinking that a person really survives until his end . . . that the
patient lets me feel his will to live such as he has the will to eat
something by mouth, or to walk or stand or sit.
Gaining Experience
Most of the participants said that it was difficult to maintain
dedication and concern. The majority of new nurses felt
"conflict with dedication" and most of them changed to feel-
ing a sense of commitment because they gained experience
and were at ease with themselves.
. . . When I became a nurse, a lot of doubts arose because of that
feeling of still being a student . . . Then I had resigned myself to
what cannot be helped . . . when I became competent in handling
my duties, and when I could understand our ward completely,
other doubts arose in my mind again, like the right to self-
determination or ethics.
Pride as a Nurse
The participants regained pride as nurses when they were
able to persuade themselves that their work was truly nurs-
ing. In other words, nurses need to understand the meaning
and effectiveness of nursing care, as well as persuade them-
selves that they fulfill patients' needs and demands.
"How are we nurses different from other caregivers without a
nurse's license?" I've thought that. But there is a difference,
clearly. Other caregivers help patients, but nurses attend to the
patient as a whole . . . the basic human needs are satisfied for
patients with intractable neurological diseases, and the
fundamental human rights are demanded for them . . . that's just
the nursing care at this ward, I think. We shouldn't forget it.
Discussion
Benner (1984) proposed a phenomenological nursing theory
comprising five stages in which nurses become experts. First
is the novice stage, which refers to focusing only on patient
data, such as vital signs, regardless of the situation. Next, in
the advanced beginner stage, nurses begin to recognize and
focus on meaningful situations that occur repeatedly. In the
competent stage, that is, the third stage, they can provide care
based on the nursing care plan. In this stage, nurses typically
have 2 to 3 years of experience in the same area or in similar
day-to-day situations. In the proficient stage, that is, the
fourth stage, nurses are able to understand the overall situa-
tion. Finally, in the expert stage, they can intuitively grasp
the situation, and their performance is now fluid, flexible,
and highly proficient.
6 SAGE Open
In the present study, all participants were expert nurses.
At university hospitals in Japan, nurses generally accumulate
experience through 2- to 4-year ward rotations. Rarely does
a nurse work in one ward for more than 6 years. There are
hardly any nurses limited to specific fields except advanced
practice nurses (APNs), certified nurse specialists, and certi-
fied nurses. Therefore, the present participants' experiences
are very valuable.
Participants talked about their experiences, including
what they thought, felt, and believed. They initially under-
took their jobs expecting to promote patient' needs and to
provide care to patients and their families; however, after a
few years, they were caught in a vicious cycle known as "the
conflict with dedication." They needed to find a reason to
become recommitted ("reasons for the change from conflict
to commitment"), and to develop their own strategies such as
"reorganization for maintaining dedication." Through this
process, they experienced "the basis of dedication."
The hospital nurse is fundamentally an organization
member; therefore, nurses are subordinate to hospital author-
ities and numerous physicians. In modern medicine, highly
technological practices, such as those used in intensive care
units, mechanical heart and lung units, dialysis units, and
medical research, are considered most important. In other
words, nurses' commitments to their patients and the profes-
sion's goals are not regarded as meaningful to medicine.
The MHLW, the Japanese Council of Nursing Universities,
and the Japanese Council of Nursing are considered creating
a new APN designation in Japan. The APN system may offer
professionalization and specialization for nurses within spe-
cific medical fields. This internal stratification of professions
is often rife with specialization. Professional tasks can be so
complex that they require considerable specializations, and
individual professionals develop enduring identification
with specialty work. Our feeling is that if APN is adopted,
other nurses may hold normal nursing in low regard because
it is "dirty work." The job of a nurse is both considered "dirty
work," as defined by Hughes (1951, 1969), and requires
"tender loving care," as pointed out by Sandelowski (2000).
If anyone is able to perform the majority of "unspecialized"
nursing tasks, nursing may no longer be considered profes-
sional work. This is just one of the changes that institutional-
ization and specialization will bring with the introduction of
an internal hierarchy (Hughes, 1951). This has been dis-
cussed by numerous sociologists as the theory of profes-
sions. It is difficult for nurses to accept this, and many nurses
have devised a stratagem to deal with professionalization.
However, patients still need nursing care--the "dirty
work"--especially patients with intractable neurological dis-
eases. They require a high level of nursing care to lead satis-
fying lives. Caring for these patients is really dirty work and
new technologies are not necessary. "Dirty work" refers to
work that nobody wishes to do. If the proposition that nurses
wish to become specialists is true, they would not think that
their work consists solely of taking care of patients. Some
believe that "advanced nursing practice" involves nursing
practice that utilizes the latest medical technology or is asso-
ciated with the latest treatment methods. As mentioned by a
number of participants, neurology wards are not a popular
choice in terms of wards that novice nurses who have just
graduated from university wish to be assigned to. This is
because the work performed in neurology wards appears at
first glance to be "simply providing care for patients," in
other words, to resemble the work performed by care work-
ers. However, as pointed out by Nagase et al. (2013), the
ability to make clinical judgments and assessment ability
among nurses are necessary for realizing a high patient QOL.
The nurses accepting these responsibilities should be rec-
ognized for performing "true nursing" and highly specialized
work. It is necessary to visualize and label nursing actions/
interventions, such as "true nursing." Labeled actions and
interventions are recognized as a form of technology by both
the public and health care professionals (including diagnos-
tic and spiritual care by nurses at the end of life); therefore,
spiritual healing that nurses usually provide through attend-
ing to patients' daily needs should be labeled "spiritual care"
and recognized as care by a nursing professional, as well as
highly specialized care. Presently, it is too easy to call spiri-
tual healing just "spiritual care," because the contents of
spiritual care are poorly understood and nonsystematic.
Conclusion
Nurses were empowered to think positively and treat patients
with dignity while remaining committed to the physical care
of their patients. Such care requires time and effort, as well
as considerable risk. Participants in the present study talked
not only about their current thoughts and experiences but
also about past experiences. They expected nursing to be a
good job and were dedicated to their patients; however, after
a few years, they got caught up in a vicious cycle known as
"the conflict with dedication." They had to rebuild pride as
nurses and recommit to the profession to find "reasons for
the change from conflict to commitment" and to develop
their own strategies, such as "reorganization for maintaining
dedication." Through this process, they acquired "the basis
of dedication."
