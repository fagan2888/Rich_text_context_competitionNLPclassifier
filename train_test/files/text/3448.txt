ABSTRACT
NSC (neural stem cells)/NPC (neural progenitor cells) are mul-
tipotent and self-renew throughout adulthood in the SVZ
(subventricular zone) of the mammalian CNS (central ner-
vous system). These cells are considered interesting targets
for CNS neurodegenerative disorder cell therapies, and un-
derstanding their behaviour in vitro is crucial if they are to
be cultured prior to transplantation. We cultured the SVZ
tissue belonging to newborn rats under the form of NS (neu-
rospheres) to evaluate the effects of Tf (transferrin) on cell
proliferation. The NS were heterogeneous in terms of the
NSC/NPC markers GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), Nestin
and Sox2 and the OL (oligodendrocyte) progenitor mark-
ers NG2 (nerve/glia antigen 2) and PDGFR (platelet-derived
growth factor receptor ). The results of this study indicate
that aTf (apoTransferrin) is able to increase cell proliferation
of SVZ-derived cells in vitro, and that these effects were
mediated at least in part by the TfRc1 (Tf receptor 1). Since
OPCs (oligodendrocyte progenitor cells) represent a signifi-
cant proportion of the proliferating cells in the SVZ-derived
primary cultures, we used the immature OL cell line N20.1 to
show that Tf was able to augment the proliferation rate of
OPC, either by adding aTf to the culture medium or by over-
expressing rat Tf in situ. The culture medium supplemented
with ferric iron, together with aTf, increased the DNA con-
tent, while ferrous iron did not. The present work provides
data that could have a potential application in human cell
replacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease and/or
CNS injury that require the use of in vitro amplified NPCs.

INTRODUCTION
The developing and adult CNS (central nervous system) of
higher vertebrates contains NPCs (neural progenitor cells)
that preserve the capacity to self-renew throughout most of
the adult life (Eriksson et al., 1998). Their most relevant prop-
erties reside in their unique ability to commit and mature into
any of the different CNS neural cell lineages, including neu-
rons and macroglia (Gould, 2007). One of the largest niches
in the CNS harbouring these cells is the SVZ (subventricu-
lar zone), although other regions within the brain contain
NPCs as well, such as the spinal cord subependymal zone,
the hippocampus dentate gyrus subgranular zone and the
previously described sub-cortical zone (Merkle and Alvarez-
Buylla, 2006; Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009; Miller and
Gauthier-Fisher, 2009).
The SVZ niche has been extensively studied in the past
few years and evidence shows that the cells residing in it
respond to injury (Picard-Ri´
era et al., 2002; Nait-Oumesmar
et al., 2007; Jablonska et al., 2010). The fact that SVZ NPCs ac-
tively engage in brain repair make them promising targets for
the design of neurodegenerative disease therapies (Lois and
Alvarez-Buylla, 1993; Kokovay et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2008).

Particularly, cells expressing the NG2 (nerve/glia antigen 2)
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan are in part derived from
the SVZ and are potential candidates that have been shown
to function as precursors for OL (oligodendrocyte) regenera-
tion in demyelinating diseases (Tripathi et al., 2010; Richard-
son et al., 2011). Progenitor proliferation and differentiation
are required during oligodendrogenesis and both processes
seem to depend on an adequate iron supply (Schonberg and
McTigue, 2009).
Mammalian iron metabolism is tightly regulated (Wang
and Pantopoulos, 2011) and involves, among many key regu-
lators, Tf (transferrin) and TfRc1 (Tf receptor) 1 and TfRc2
(Dautry-Varsat, 1986; Anderson and Vulpe, 2009). In the
brain, TfRc1 is mainly detected in neurons and endothelial
cells. It is also expressed in oligodendroglial precursors and
is down-regulated in mature OL (Leitner and Connor, 2012).
TfRc2 has also been detected in the brain (Kawabata et al.,
1999). On the other hand, Tf is mainly synthesized in the
liver and secreted into the blood stream from where it is able
to transcytose across the blood­brain barrier into the CNS
(Broadwell et al., 1996); however, the amount that effec-
tively reaches the brain parenchyma is insufficient to satisfy
the brain's iron metabolic demands. Therefore, most of the
Tf found in the CNS is endogenously synthesized by OL and
choroid plexus cells, and is required for iron mobilization
within the brain parenchyma and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)
(Espinosa de los Monteros et al., 1988; Morris et al., 1992;
Connor and Menzies, 1995; Moos et al., 2007).
Previous reports regarding Tf effects on the CNS demon-
strate this glycoprotein is able to increase myelin content
during the rat's early postnatal development (Escobar Cabr-
era et al., 1994; 1997; Marta et al., 2000), and suggest Tf is an
OL pro-maturating factor. Nonetheless, recent data support
the trophic effects of Tf on rat SVZ cells in vivo, where an aTf
(apoTransferrin) intracranial injection into the ventricles of
rats after hypoxia/ischaemia increases the expression of the
PCNA (proliferation cell nuclear antigen; Guardia Clausi et al.,
2010). Although these in vivo findings clearly show that Tf is
able to modulate both cell proliferation and differentiation,
they also suggest that Tf effects are mainly dependent on the
identity of the cells it targets.
The NS (neurospheres) culture assay has been widely used
as an in vitro model to study the progression of undiffer-
entiated cells to OL. We have recently examined the effects
of aTf treatment on young rat SVZ-derived NS and found
that during oligodendrogenesis aTf was able to control cell
proliferation, lineage commitment or cell differentiation de-
pending on the time point at which the treatments were car-
ried out (Silvestroff et al., 2012). Therefore, in this report, we
evaluated if the early event associated with the activation
of NPC proliferation was conserved in neonatal SVZ tissue
cultures and further investigated the molecular mechanisms
by which Tf is able to stimulate cell proliferation.
We determined that the increase in NS proliferation
rate was associated with the increment in NS size, and this
effect was mediated by the incorporation of Tf into cells
through TfR1. Since OPC (oligodendrocyte progenitor cell)
represented the highest proportion of proliferating cells in
the NS, we used the OL cell line N20.1 and confirmed Tf had
similar effects in this culture system. We conclude OPC is
responsible for the increase in NS size after Tf treatment.
Furthermore, Tf could be used to augment OPC numbers for
future cell replacement therapies, where NPC require in vitro
expansion in a serum-free culture medium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All animal procedures used in this study were performed
following the guidelines established by Buenos Aires Uni-
versity School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry. Albino Wistar
rats (Rattus norvegicus) were housed under 12 h light/12 h
dark cycles. They were fed rodent pellet chow and water ad
libitum.
The culture medium
DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/nutrient mix-
ture F-12; Gibco®) culture media was prepared with slight
modifications. We added 1.2 g of sodium bicarbonate (Cal-
biochem) and 4 g of anhydrous glucose (Sigma­Aldrich®)
per litre. Sodium penicillin G and streptomycin sulfate were
added to a final concentration of 20 units/ml and 20 g/ml
respectively, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. For SVZ-derived
NS cultures, B27 supplement (Gibco®) was added to the
medium at a final concentration of 2% (DMEM/F12-B27).
The B27 supplement used to prepare the culture medium con-
tains unknown-to-the-buyer Tf concentrations (Brewer et al.,
1993). The proliferation medium was prepared by supple-
menting the DMEM/F12-B27 media with the mitogens bFGF
(basic fibroblast growth factor; 20 ng/ml) and EGF (epider-
mal growth factor, 20 ng/ml) (Peprotech®). For N20.1 cells,
we used DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2% FCS (fetal calf
serum).
SVZ-derived free-floating NS cultures
Two- to four-day-old male and female rats were killed
and brains were removed. For SVZ-derived NS cultures, the
periventricular tissue was removed from the brains and me-
chanically dissociated to a single cell suspension with a
1 ml automatic pipette. Cells were expanded in proliferat-
ing medium in a humidified incubator at 36C and 5% CO2
.
Growth factors (bFGF and EGF) were added to the medium
every 2 days. Proliferating cells grew into free-floating aggre-
gates known as NS, which began appearing as from the third
day in vitro. NS were allowed to expand for 6 days before

dissociation. To dissociate whole NS into a single cell suspen-
sion, NS were allowed to settle for 10 min at room tempera-
ture (20C), and were then mechanically dissociated to a sin-
gle cell suspension by pipetting them up and down 15 times
with a 1 ml automatic pipette. Finally, the cell suspension was
resuspended in fresh proliferating medium. Alternatively, NS
were dissociated using the Neurocult® Chemical Dissociation
Kit protocol (Stem Cell Technologies). The cell suspensions
were either used to regenerate a new passage of NS, or
were directly sewed on to an adherent surface: a Petri dish
or a glass coverslip. For whole NS analysis, NS were plated
on PO (polyornithine)-coated coverslips for at least 4 h and
then fixed. For individual cell analyses, dissociated NS were
plated over night in a 100 l volume of culture medium on
PO-coated coverslips within a 24-well plate. Once individual
cells were attached, the wells were completed with 400 l of
fresh proliferating medium. For the culture treatments with
aTf, the NS-derived cells were incubated for 6 days in the
presence of mitogens.
The N20.1 cell line
The N20.1 oligodendroglial cell line used to evaluate Tf ef-
fects on cell proliferation was a gift from Dr Campagnoni's
laboratory. The cell line generation has been described by
Foster et al. (1993) and Verity et al. (1993). The cells were
generated from mouse OL cultures, and were immortalized
by infecting them with a viral vector that expresses the
simian virus large T antigen. The simian virus large T anti-
gen is capable of maintaining an immortalized phenotype
at a proliferation-permissive temperature (34C). At higher
temperatures (39C), the thermo-labile antigen is degraded,
forcing the N20.1 cells to exit the cell cycle and initiate their
maturation process. We used a constant cell culture tem-
perature of 36C at all times, as a compromise temperature
between the 37C needed for the SVZ-primary NS cultures
and the proliferation-permissive temperature needed for this
immortalized cell line. Under these conditions, these cells
continue to enter the cell cycle and remain as immature OL
progenitors. The N20.1 cells were grown attached to plas-
tic flasks in 2% FCS-supplemented DMEM/F12 medium. The
cell line was also cultured as free floating spheres in non-
adhesive plastic Petri dishes. The N20.1 spheres were called
OS (oligospheres), to differentiate them from SVZ-derived
NS.
aTf treatments
A human aTf (Sigma­Aldrich®) sterile 50×stock solution
(5 mg/ml) was used to treat the SVZ-derived primary cul-
tures and the N20.1 cell line at a final concentration of
100 g/ml. The culture medium was replaced every 2 days
during treatment. All the aTf treatments were performed in
parallel with control cultures (CTL) lacking aTf supplemen-
tation. For the SVZ-derived primary cultures, attached cells
were treated with aTf for 6 days, while N20.1 cells were ex-
posed to aTf for 2 or 6 days according to the assay performed.
For Tf uptake studies, attached cells were exposed to Tf-TR
(Texas Red-labelled Tf; InvitrogenTM) at a 100 g/ml final
concentration for 24 h prior to fixation. For the treatment
of free-floating NS with the Tf receptor blocking antibody
(clone 42/6), the antibody concentration was set at 5 g/ml
in the culture medium according to data published by Trow-
bridge and Lopez (1982).
Tf overexpression in the N20.1 cell line
Cells were plated overnight before the transfection. The
cells were transfected with circular pExpTf (pExpressTf; Open
Biosystems) to overexpress the secretable form of Tf by us-
ing LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h. The pExpTf
vector carries a rat Tf cDNA obtained from rat testis mRNA
(NCBI accession number BC087021). The control cells were
transfected with a circular pExpress vector lacking Tf cDNA
(pExp). For BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) incorporation assays,
cells were transfected with either vector (pExp or pExpTf) and
cultured for 2 days after the transfection protocol. For DNA
quantitative analysis, the cells were cultured for 6 days af-
ter the transfection protocol. In this last case, the cells were
transfected with linear plasmid vectors. We used a pExpTf
vector digested within the Tf coding sequence as a negative
control. Both linear vectors were treated with calf intestine
ALP (alkaline phosphatase) to avoid any re-ligation. Cells were
analysed 6 days post transfection to decrease the probability
of plasmid loss.
Culture medium supplementation with ferric
citrate or ferrous sulfate
For studies of iron supplementation in the culture medium of
the N20.1 cell line, we calculated the basal ferric and ferrous
ion status of the DMEM/F12 culture medium to be 0.125 M
and 1.5 M respectively. The 2% FCS was analysed for iron
content and showed to be 0.35 M. For an aTf concentra-
tion of 100 g/ml in the culture treatments, we estimated it
equalled 1.25 M if we considered Tf had a molecular mass of
80 kDa. Since aTf has two binding sites for iron, we explored
the effects of ferric citrate and ferrous sulfate at 2.5 M, a
concentration that equalled the amount of binding sites on
the added aTf. A 1000-fold lower concentration of 2.5 nM
for each iron source was added to the experimental design
as a low dose condition.
Fluorescent DNA quantitative analysis
DNA was quantified following the technique described by
Gallagher (2000). After the N20.1 cells were treated for
6 days, either with aTf in the culture medium or by overex-
pressing Tf, the wells were rinsed twice with pre-warmed PBS
and incubated in TNE (10 mM Tris base, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 M
NaCl and 100 ng/ml Hoechst 33258, pH 7.4). The fluorescence

was measured using the FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices) or
the VictorTM X Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). The ex
was set at 355 nm and the em
at 460 nm.
ICC (immunocytochemistry)
A 4% (w/v) PFA (paraformaldehyde)­PBS solution was used
for cell fixation of attached cultures. Fixed cells were
blocked overnight in 5% FCS. Primary antibodies were in-
cubated overnight at 4C (Table 1). Coverslips were rinsed
in PBS, and secondary fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies
were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. All antibodies
were prepared in a 1% FCS, 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS solution.
Secondary antibodies were diluted together with Hoechst
33258 nuclear dye. The fluorochromes conjugated to the sec-
ondary antibodies were the following: DyLight 488, DyLight
594, Cy2, Cy3 and FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.). Fi-
nally, coverslips were rinsed in deionized water and mounted
on glass slides with Mowiol® 4-88 anti-fade mounting so-
lution (Calbiochem). For BrdU incorporation analysis by ICC
in N20.1 cells or on attached dissociated NS cells, 10 M
BrdU (Sigma­Aldrich®) was added to culture media for 4 h
or 24 h before fixation respectively. BrdU incorporation on
whole NS was performed by exposing cultures to BrdU for 4 h
before fixation. All BrdU-treated cells were fixed in 4% PFA
for 20 min at room temperature. For BrdU immunodetec-
tion, the cells were rinsed in PBS after fixation and exposed
to 2 M HCl for 20 min at 37C, neutralized with PBS, and
blocked overnight in a 5% FCS-PBS solution. After the FCS
blocking step, the ICC procedure with primary and secondary
antibodies continued as described above.
ICC and cell number quantification
For Figures 2(P), 3(L), 3(P), 4(D), 4(H) and 6(J), cell pro-
portions were quantified from microscope images accord-
ing to the immunodetection of two different cell mark-
ers. The two cell markers simultaneously analysed on a
given cell preparation were identified using green or red
fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. The images
acquired with the different microscope filters for a given
field were merged to obtain a single three coloured im-
age, where blue always corresponded to the total cell nu-
clei that incorporated the Hoechst dye. Cells expressing
each one or both markers were manually quantified and
normalized to the total amount of Hoechst+ nuclei in
the field and expressed as the means +
- S.E.M. Number of
cells lacking the expression of both markers was calculated.

Tf promotes proliferation of SVZ cells
NS, an average of 4 (+
-1) epi-fluorescence microscopy
images were taken of the BrdU+ nuclei at different focal
planes within each NS (as shown in Supplementary Figure
S4 at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e107add.htm).
The number of images varied according to the size of the
NS. The BrdU+ nuclei were counted on the first image and
labelled, after which these digital labels were merged on the
second image. Then, the BrdU+ nuclei were counted and la-
belled on this second image. We avoided counting BrdU+
nuclei that already had a digital label (brought on from the
previous image). The labels of the second image were added
to the labels of the previous image and altogether merged on
the third image. The procedure was repeated for each addi-
tional image of a given NS to prevent the counting of BrdU+
nuclei more than once. The resulting number of BrdU+ la-
belled cells was finally normalized to the NS size. The NS size
(volume) was calculated from the NS radius (Supplementary
Figure S4A). At least 80 NS were counted from each condition
from two independent experiments.
Tf-TR intraventricular injections
Rat pups (P2­4
) were anaesthetized by hypothermia and sub-
jected to an intraventricular injection of 1 l of sterile Tf-TR
(100 g/ml). A 1 cm-long longitudinal and superficial inci-
sion was performed with a scalpel over the cranium skin. A 30
gauge needle was used to gently prick the cranium bones at
1 mm (posterior) and 1 mm (lateral) from the Bregma to ease
the access of the injection pipette needle. The rats were then
injected with the Tf-TR solution by inserting the injection
needle 4 mm deep into the CNS lateral ventricle.
Immunohistochemistry
The brains of the P2­4
rat pups were removed and rinsed in
PBS, and then fixed in a 4% (w/v) PFA overnight at 4C.
Whole brains were sequentially soaked for 24 h in 15% and
30% sucrose solutions. Finally, the brains were frozen at
- 80C. To obtain 30 m-thick coronal sections, the brains
were processed using a Leica CM 1850 cryostat. The brain
sections were collected in a 50% glycerol solution and kept
at - 20C. For the histochemistry procedure, brain slices
were rinsed thrice in PBS, mounted on to gelatin-treated
glass slides and air dried. The sections were blocked in 5%
FCS­PBS solution for 2 h and then sequentially exposed to the
primary and secondary antibodies, as described for the ICC
procedure. Finally, the sections were mounted with Mowiol
mounting solution.
SDS/PAGE and Western blotting
For cultured-cell protein analysis, adherent cells were washed
twice with pre-warmed 0.1 M PBS at 37C, scrapped off
the Petri dishes and lysed in TOTEX buffer [20 nM Hepes,
pH 7.9, 350 nM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Igepal®, 1 nM MgCl2
,
0.5 nM EGTA, 0.1 nM, 10 g/ml leupeptine, 10 g/ml pep-
statine, 0.5 nM DTT (dithiothreitol) and 0.5 nM PMSF] on ice
and kept at - 20C until processed. Whenever culture me-
dia were replaced on adherent cultures, samples of the old
culture media were retrieved for protein analysis. These cul-
ture media aliquots were centrifuged for 10 min at 6700 g
to remove any cell debris, and supernatants were recovered
for storage at - 20C. For 35-day-old rat brain tissue sam-
ples, animals were anaesthetized and perfused with PBS to
remove blood from vasculature before sample collection. The
rat brains were then homogenized in a volume of PBS equal
to the brain weight. The CSF samples were obtained from
non-perfused rats and were centrifuged. CSF sample con-
taining a red blood cell pellet were discarded due to serum-Tf
contamination.
The proteins belonging to the different samples were
quantified by the Bradford assay and electrophoresed in de-
naturing SDS polyacrylamide 12% gels. Proteins were then
transferred on to a methanol-activated ImmobylonTM PVDF
membrane and blocked in a 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed
milk powder, PBS solution for 2 h at room temperature.
Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4C (Table 1). After rinsing in a 0.1% Tween
20, PBS solution, membranes were incubated for 2 h at room
temperature with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated
secondary antibodies, and then rinsed in a 0.1% Tween 20,
PBS solution. Primary and secondary antibodies were di-
luted in a 1% FCS, 0.1% Tween 20, PBS solution. Protein
immunodetection was performed with a 0.1% 3,3 -DAB (di-
aminobenzidine), 0.1% NiSO4
, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffered
solution (pH 5), with freshly added H2
O2
(1 l/ml). After
colour development, membranes were rinsed in PBS, air dried
and scanned. Immunolabelled bands on membranes were
quantified with ScionImage software. In the case of Tf de-
tection in whole P35
and P4
rat brains, the Tf immunopositve
band was corrected by the dilution factor of the samples. For
Coomassie Blue stained gels, proteins were electrophoresed
in polyacrylamide gels and directly stained with the dye
(Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 0.25% in methanol:glacial acetic
acid:water 45:7:48) overnight at room temperature, and dis-
coloured at room temperature in methanol:glacial acetic
acid:water 45:7:48 until gel background was transparent.
RT­PCR (reverse transcription­PCR)
For the isolation of RNA samples from brain tissues we used
the Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen), and followed the proto-
col provided by the manufacturer. The retro-transcription
and PCRs were performed using MMLV (Moloney murine
leukaemia virus)­RT and Go-Taq from Promega, and the re-
sulting PCR products were run in 2% agarose gels. The primer
sequences used for the PCRs are listed in Table 2.

RESULTS
The culture medium analysis
We decided to evaluate if Tf enhanced cell division in the
neonatal rat brain-derived NS assay, since Tf has been de-
scribed as a key regulator of cell cycle. To avoid the use
of FCS-supplemented medium and the possible variations in
the culture medium composition, we used B27-supplemented
DMEM/F12 (DMEM/F12-B27) to culture SVZ-derived cells.
Although the B27-supplemented culture medium in which
these primary cultures developed contained Tf, the
manufacturers did not share information regarding its
concentration or the species it comes from or if it was
a recombinant molecule. Nonetheless, we analysed the
DMEM/F12-B27 culture medium by WB (Western blotting)
and observed a low Tf detection. Since the anti-Tf antibody
used for the WB was raised against rat Tf, it could have
had a low affinity for the B27 Tf, if the latter belonged
to another species different from rat. We performed an
SDS/PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining analysis of the culture
media proteins and confirmed that the B27-supplement pro-
vided negligible amounts of Tf to the culture medium com-
pared with the aTf-supplemented condition (aTf 100 g/ml)
we wanted to test (Supplementary Figures S1A and S1B at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e107add.htm).
The SVZ-derived NS culture system
In the absence of growth factors in the culture media, NS
were still able to develop although they reached smaller
sizes after 6 days in culture compared with the bFGF/EGF-
supplemented condition (Supplementary Figures S2A­S2D at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e107add.htm). These
results indicate that cells in this system are still capable of
proliferating in vitro in the absence of exogenously added
growth factors, suggesting the possibility of growth factor(s)
being endogenously synthesized in these cultures. Nonethe-
less, NS formation was performed from here on in the pres-
ence of the growth factors EGF and bFGF to enhance cell
amplification in vitro. We termed this a proliferating culture
condition, since it was more permissive to cell division than
the condition lacking exogenously added growth factors.
The basal proliferation rate of SVZ-derived cells in vitro
was analysed after mechanical cell dissociation and seeding
on PO-coated coverslips. As BrdU exposure time increased,
the proportion of BrdU+ nuclei increased as well (Supple-
mentary Figure S2E). However, due to cell heterogeneity in
this kind of culture, the cell cycle time of the culture as a
whole is not a representative measure of the cell cycle of
each different cell type derived from the SVZ. Nonetheless,
for dissociated NS cultures, the BrdU pulse was then set at
24 h.
Tf and TfRc expression in the CNS and cell
cultures
We were interested in comparing the Tf content in the CSF,
since this fluid bathes the enterity of the lateral ventricle

Tf promotes proliferation of SVZ cells
Figure 1 Tf and TfRc expression analysis in the CNS and in cell cultures
(A) The Tf protein content was quantified in serum, whole brain homogenates and the CSF of at least two 35-day-old rats (P35
)
and at least two 4-day-old rats (P4
) by WB, and compared with a culture medium sample supplemented with aTf (100 g/ml). The
absorbance of the WB bands was semi-quantified using a calibration curve containing different aTf concentrations, as indicated in
Supplementary Figure S3. (B) RT­PCRs were performed on RNA isolated from P35
and P4
rats using primers for Tf, TfRc1, TfRc2 and
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Testis, liver and choroid plexus were obtained from P35
rats, while liver, choroid
plexus and SVZ tissue samples belonged to P4
rats. The NS samples were obtained from culturing the SVZ of P4
rats, and N20.1 indicates

walls and is in intimate contact with the SVZ niche. Since
CSF without plasma contamination was only obtainable from
rats from a young adolescent age, we compared the Tf con-
tent of the CSF belonging to P35
rats with the whole brain
and plasma of age-matched animals, and with the Tf con-
tent in whole brain samples and serum belonging to newborn
rats (P4
). The Tf protein expression was analysed and semi-
quantified by WB, and its presence was confirmed in high
amounts in P35
and P4
rat serum (Figure 1A). Tf concentra-
tions in whole brain homogenates (P35
and P4
) and CSF sam-
ples (P35
) were notoriously lower than that observed in serum
samples but nonetheless detectable. The aTf concentration
used to supplement the NS culture medium (100 g/ml)
was similar to the Tf concentrations detected in the CSF
and brain tissue. The WB membranes, which were used to
build Figure 1(A), are shown in Supplementary Figure S3 (at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e107add.htm).
To confirm that Tf was synthesized in the rat CNS, the
Tf expression was analysed together with TfRc by RT­PCR in
tissues belonging to P35
and neonatal P4
rats (Figure 1B). The
RNA belonging to P35
rat testis, liver and choroid plexus were
used as positive controls, since all these samples expressed
Tf and both TfRc 1 and 2. TfRc2 showed the presence of a
major transcript, and a faint band corresponding to a larger
transcript. The liver, choroid plexus and the SVZ tissues be-
longing to P4
rats showed Tf and TfRc1 expression, similar to
those detected in samples belonging to the P35
rats. In the
case of TfRc2, a larger transcript was detected in neonatal
liver, choroid plexus and SVZ samples together with the clas-
sic isoforms, although at higher levels compared with the P35
rats. Furthermore, the proportions of both TfRc2 isoforms
were different depending on the neonatal tissue analysed.
These results indicate that besides the detection of various
TfRc2 isoforms, other than the already described  and 
isoforms, they were differentially regulated. The NS obtained
from the SVZ of P4
rats contained transcripts belonging to Tf
and to both TfRc1 and TfRc2. The N20.1 cell line belonging
to immortalized mouse OL progenitors contained transcripts
belonging to Tf and to both TfRc 1 and TfRc2, with a single
PCR amplicon for each primer set.
Sox2 and Olig2 expression in vivo and in vitro
The SVZ of P2­4
rats was analysed in vivo, where we searched
for cells expressing the NPC transcription factor Sox2 and
the glial transcription factor Olig2. Although Sox2 expres-
sion was expected to be restricted to the SVZ, Sox2+ nuclei
were identified in the CC (corpus callosum) and the CP (cau-
date putamen) as well (Figure 2A). Nonetheless, the greatest
concentration of Sox2-expressing cells was located in the
SVZ, confirming that this structure was enriched in NPCs. The
immunodetection of Olig2+ cells in the same brain sections
demonstrated that Olig2 was expressed by a minority of nu-
clei within the SVZ (Figures 2B­2D). Confocal images of the
SVZ confirmed that Olig2 was expressed by some cells within
the SVZ, and that some co-expressed Sox2 (Figures 2E­2H,
arrow in Figure 2G). However, most of the Sox2+ cells in the
SVZ were Olig2- .
Similar to the results obtained from histochemical anal-
ysis, the NS cells in the NS culture system expressed

Sox2 and Olig2. Furthermore, besides noticing that the ex-
pression of both these transcription factors was mutually
exclusive in some cells, many others were clearly
Sox2+ /Olig2+ (Figures 2I­2L, arrow in Figure 2K). Disso-
ciated NS cultures showed that 90% of the cells that make
up an NS expressed the transcription factors Sox2 or Olig2,
as a whole (Figures 2M­2P). Only a small fraction of the im-
munopositive cells expressed either one of the transcription
factors, while most co-expressed them both (Figure 2P). These
data confirmed there is a bias of SVZ NPCs in vitro towards
glial lineages compared with what occurred in vivo, and that
the large amounts of Sox2 and Olig2 double-labelled cells
might correspond to NPCs that were transitioning towards a
glial, or even OPC, phenotype.
Undifferentiated cells in NS
To further confirm that the cells in the SVZ-derived NS
contained NPCs, we analysed SVZ-derived primary cultures
with antibodies raised against acetylated -tubulin. Although
in vivo ependymal cells contain numerous cilia that are la-
belled for acetylated tubulin, a single immunopositive cil-
ium is characteristic of the SVZ type B NPC that protrudes

through the SVZ wall and contacts the CSF. A single acety-
lated tubulin+ cilium was detected in vitro on the cells within
whole NS and in dissociated NS cultures (Figures 3A­3D, ar-
rowheads in Figure 3B, arrows in Figure 3D).
The cell proliferation in whole NS was evaluated af-
ter a 4 h BrdU pulse. The NS cells incorporated BrdU and
confirmed that cells within the NS were able to prolifer-
ate in vitro. A large proportion of cells within the NS ex-
pressed the Sox2 transcription factor, indicating their undif-
ferentiated phenotype. Only a fraction of BrdU+ cells were
Sox2+ , demonstrating that NS contain proliferating cells
other than NPC (Figures 3E­3H). The considerable amount
of Sox2+ /BrdU- cells might be a consequence of the rela-
tively short BrdU pulse. NS were dissociated to a single cell
suspension and exposed to a 24 h BrdU pulse to analyse the
identity of proliferating cells. NS-derived cultures contained
GFAP+ (glial fibrillary acidic protein) cells (20%), although
only a small proportion of these cells were BrdU+ (Fig-
ures 3I­3L). In a similar manner, Nestin+ cells were also im-
munodetected, with small amounts of Nestin+ /BrdU+ cells
(Figures 3M­3P).
Glia and OPC-related markers in NS
A further characterization of the Olig2+ cells demonstrated
that only 25% of them expressed the OPC marker NG2
(Figures 4A­4D), while PDGFR (platelet-derived growth
factor receptor ) was detected in 15% of the Olig2+ cells

(Figures 4E­4H). Interestingly, some NG2+ cells lacked
Olig2 expression (Figures 4A­4C, arrowhead). No
Olig2- /PDGFR+ cells were detected. The presence of
large amounts of Olig2+ /NG2- and Olig2+ /PDGFR-
cells, together with the high proportion of cells co-expressing
Olig2 and Sox2, suggests that most Olig2+ cells might be
committed to the oligodendroglial lineage and have not
yet activated the expression of the NG2 or PDGFR genes.
Alternatively, they might be committed to other neural lines,
such as the astrocyte lineage, that do not express these
surface markers.
Both NG2+ and PDGFR+ cell populations grew in char-
acteristic clusters, rather than spread out evenly among other
cells. This might contribute to the knowledge that the SVZ-
derived cultures contain distinct immature progenitors that
are able to divide clonally, and give rise to groups of cells ex-
pressing the same cell surface markers as their progenitors.
Notwithstanding, we decided to consider NG2+ /PDGFR+
cells as cells committed to the oligodendroglial lineage.
Effects of aTf on SVZ-derived cell proliferation
Free floating NS were cultured in the absence or presence
of human aTf (100 g/ml) in the culture media. The culture
conditions were therefore termed CTL and aTf respectively.
The size of NS was studied as a function of time, and the
results indicated that NS were significantly larger in the aTf
condition compared with CTL condition as from the sixth
day in culture (Figure 5A). To confirm that the NS size in-
crement observed in the aTf condition was a consequence
of an increase in cell proliferation, the BrdU+ nuclei within
the whole NS (non-dissociated) were quantified and normal-
ized to the NS volume (Supplementary Figures S4A­S4F at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e107add.htm). The
data indicated that the cell proliferation rate was increased
after the aTf exposure in vitro (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the
use of a monoclonal antibody that blocked the TfRc1 in the
culture media was able to significantly dampen the aTf ef-
fects on the NS size, and demonstrated that the TfRc1 was
involved in the effects of aTf on cell proliferation in the NS
cultures (Figure 5C).
Tf was detected in dissociated NS cultures by ICC (Fig-
ures 5D and 5E). NS cultures grown in the CTL condition
did not show any appreciable Tf immunodetection. The aTf-
treated cultures showed an increase in Tf immunostaining
(Figures 5E and 5F). Since aTf was shown to increase the cell
proliferation rate in whole NS, we evaluated if there was a di-
rect and proportional correlation between proliferation and
Tf incorporation. We suspected cells undergoing the S phase
of the cell cycle, and that were therefore BrdU+ , would in-
corporate larger amounts of Tf compared with BrdU- cells.
However, we were unable to notice significant changes in
the Tf incorporation patterns of BrdU+ or BrdU- cells (Fig-
ures 5G). Nonetheless, these higher magnification images
of aTf-treated cultures that showed small immunopositive
puncta, suggested Tf was being incorporated into the cells via
the canonical TfRc-mediated endocytic pathway (Figure 5G).
The Tf incorporation in aTf-treated cultures was analysed
by confocal microscopy together with TfRc1 immunodetec-
tion (Figures 5H­5J). Tf was detected in all cells, and co-
localized with TfRc1. The differences found in Tf immunore-
activity between Figures 5(G) and 5(H) could be attributable
to the HCl treatment used for the BrdU antigen retrieval that
could have partially damaged Tf epitopes. Although all cells
expressed the TfRc1, this receptor was not evenly distributed
within the cells. Some cells expressed the TfRc1 restricted to
the soma, while others had TfRc1 expressed in both cell soma
and its ramifications (Figures 5H­5J). Tf was also detected in

cell ramifications where TfRc1 was not detected. This allowed
us to speculate that the immunodetected Tf could have ei-
ther been synthesized in those same cells, could have been
incorporated via the TfRc2 or could have been incorporated
by TfRc1 in the cell soma and then transported along the
TfRc1- cell processes.
Tf incorporation in SVZ-derived primary cultures
We decided to use Tf-TR to identify the Tf being incor-
porated into the cells in culture, and simultaneously ab-
rogate the detection of endogenously synthesized Tf. This
method allowed us to confirm that not only was Tf be-
ing incorporated into the SVZ-derived cells in vitro but it
was also specifically interacting with the ubiquitously ex-
pressed TfRc1 (CD71) (Supplementary Figures S5A­S5C at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e107add.htm). The
Tf-TR fluorescence was identified with the same punctate
pattern as the immunodetected TfRc1. Tf-TR was also shown
to be incorporated into BrdU+ cells (Supplementary Figures
S5D­S5F), as well as into Sox2+ and Olig2+ cells (Supple-
mentary Figures S5G­S5L). Since there were no apprecia-
ble differences in the quantities of Tf-TR incorporated into
BrdU+ or BrdU- cells, we interpret that Tf-TR was inter-
nalized into the cells regardless of their engagement in the
cell cycle S phase. Both NG2 and PDGFR were able to incor-
porate Tf-TR (Supplementary Figures S5M­S5R). Some cells
that did not express any of the cell makers previously men-
tioned incorporated great amounts of Tf-TR (Supplementary
Figure S5L, arrow). These data confirmed that Tf uptake in
SVZ-derived cells is detected with a punctate pattern, and
that it is a widespread phenomenon that is not restricted to

proliferating cells. Furthermore, it suggests Tf binding to cells
must be following the canonical TfRc-mediated iron delivery
pathway.
NG2 and PDGFR expression in NS and N20.1
cell cultures
Since the SVZ in vivo and the cultured SVZ-derived cells
contained Olig2+ cells, which are suggested to give rise to
NG2+ /PDGFR+ OPC, we decided to evaluate if they could
be a possible target of aTf in vivo. We injected Tf-TR into the
right lateral ventricle of P2­4
rats and evaluated the red flu-
orescence in the cells surrounding the SVZ and neighbouring
CC regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The rationale for
the use of 2­4-day-old rat pups for the injections was based
on the desire to evaluate the SVZ progenitors in vivo at the
same age as those used to isolate the SVZ for the NS cul-
tures. Furthermore, at this postnatal age the proliferating
progenitors in the SVZ-niche and surrounding parenchyma
are abundant and in a proliferative stage. Although there
was a generalized and faint fluorescence dispersed through-
out the tissue sections, some structures and cells incorporated
large amounts of Tf-TR that were observed as distinct red-
fluorescent puncta. Besides finding that the vasculature and
some microglial cells incorporated large amounts of Tf-TR
(data not shown), the NG2+ cells incorporated Tf-TR with
a characteristic punctate pattern consistent with the Tf-TR
endocytosis previously described in the in vitro experiments
(Figures 6A­6C).
The analysis of BrdU+ nuclei revealed that almost 40% of
all BrdU+ cells were positive for NG2, and to a lesser extent
were PDGFR+ (Figures 6D, 6E and 6J). When analysing the
proliferation rate of NG2+ and PDGFR+ cell populations,
50% and 60% of them were BrdU+ respectively. Besides
demonstrating that almost all NG2+ and PDGFR+ cells be-
longed to the Olig2+ cell population (Figure 4), we evaluated
the degree of co-localization of both these surface markers
on dissociated NS cultures (Figures 6F and 6K). The results
showed that the expression of these molecules overlapped
in most of the immunopositive cells (Figure 6F, arrows), and
we considered these double-labelled cells were OPC. We did
notice that a small fraction of them expressed either one of
the two markers (Figure 6F, whole and empty arrowheads).
On the basis of these results, we questioned whether the
NG2/PDGFR cell population could be responsible for the in-
creased proliferative response of NS-derived cells to the Tf
treatment. In order to test this hypothesis, we decided to
use N20.1 immortalized oligodendroglial cell line grown in
culture conditions in which cells are maintained in prolifer-
ation as undifferentiated progenitors. The N20.1 cells were
enriched as a whole in NG2+ and PDGFR+ cells when com-
pared with the NS primary cultures, and were considered an
appropriate system to evaluate Tf effects on the OPC pop-
ulation (Figures 6F, 6I and 6K). Interestingly, when PDGFR
was only partially expressed in some cells, this expression
was concentrated in areas where cell membranes contacted
each other (Figure 6I, arrowheads). We noticed that the po-
larized PDGFR expression took place when at least one of
the contact partner membranes expressed NG2, in agreement
with data suggesting PDGFR interacts with NG2 on surface
membranes of cells.
The proliferation capacity of both NG2+ and PDGFR+
cells in the N20.1 cell line was evaluated as well, since ap-
proximately half the NG2+ cells lacked PDGFR expression.
Besides confirming their high proliferative rate, there were no
distinct differences among them according to this parameter
(Figures 6G, 6H and 6L).
Effects of aTf on N20.1 cell cultures
We added 2% FCS in the culture media so that the ad-
dition of exogenous aTf (100 g/ml) would be appreciably
different from the untreated culture condition. The total
proteins present in the DMEM/F12 culture media were anal-
ysed by SDS/PAGE at different percentages of FCS supple-
mentation, and in the presence or absence of added aTf.
The optimal FCS supplementation percentage that allowed
us to identify a significant increase in Tf content in the cul-
ture medium proteins compared with the control condition
was 2% (Supplementary Figures S6A and S6B, available at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e107add.htm). We
made sure the N20.1 cells in the 2% FCS-supplemented cul-
ture medium were proliferating.
To analyse the effects of aTf on the OL cell line in a similar
assay as the one used with the SVZ primary cultures, we devel-
oped a method to grow N20.1 cells as free-floating spheres.
In this case, since the cells used to form the spheres belonged
to an OL-enriched culture, we decided to term the spher-
ical structures formed from N20.1 cells as OS (Figure 7A).
A 4 h BrdU pulse allowed us to observe a large number of
proliferating cells within the OS (Figure 7B). We detected
a significant increase in the mean size of the OS when aTf
was added to the culture medium compared with the CTL
condition (Figure 7C).
Due to the amount of proliferating cells within whole OS,
their quantification in this three-dimensional structure was
cumbersome. Therefore the proliferation rate of the N20.1
cell line was analysed by BrdU incorporation in dissociated
monolayer cultures. We first evaluated the increase in the
number of BrdU+ cells after exposing the cells to differ-
ent BrdU time pulses (Figure 7D). We decided to use a 4 h
BrdU pulse and confirmed by ICC that the proliferation of
the N20.1 cell line was increased when exposed to aTf for
48 h in the culture medium compared with the CTL condition
(Figure 7E). A fluorometric assay was used to quantify DNA.
This method was considered an indirect approach to mea-
suring the cumulative effects of an increased proliferation
rate, and could serve to complement the BrdU incorporation
experiments. The results showed that not only did the 6-day
aTf-treatment increase the DNA amounts but also indicated
that this response to aTf was dose dependent (Figure 7F).

Since the cell viability could be an additional variable re-
sponsible for the increase in DNA amounts and in the BrdU+
cell numbers in the aTf-treated cultures, we decided to evalu-
ate if cell death by apoptosis was decreased in these cultures
compared with controls. The immunodetection of activated
caspase III+ cells was used to quantify the number of apop-
totic cells in either CTL or in aTf-treated cultures. There was
no difference in the amount of Caspase III+ cells among the
different treatments, which allowed us to confirm that aTf
increased the cell proliferation rather than protected cells
from cell death by apoptosis (Figure 7G).
Tf incorporation in the N20.1 cell line
Similar to the rat NS primary cultures, we decided to make
sure that the added aTf in the culture medium was internal-
ized into the cells by using the ICC technique. Simultaneously,
we evaluated the Tf-TR fluorescent pattern in the same cul-
tures to discriminate the FCS-derived, or the endogenously
synthesized Tf, from the human aTf we added to the culture
media. When no aTf was added to the culture medium (CTL),
there was a faint red fluorescence background and signifi-
cant punctate immunodetection for Tf (Figures 8A and 8B).
The data in Figure 8(A) indicate that the Tf detected could
belong to that synthesized by the N20.1 cells or to the Tf of
bovine origin contained in the FCS. As expected, when aTf
was added to the culture medium (aTf condition), although
there still was no significant red fluorescence detection, there
was a noticeable increase in the amount and intensity of
Tf+ immunoreactive puncta (Figures 8C and 8D). This result
is in agreement with the SDS/PAGE analysis of the culture
medium proteins belonging to CTL and aTf-supplemented
culture medium (Supplementary Figure S6), where the overall
Tf content is appreciably increased in the aTf supplemented
condition compared with the control condition.
When Tf-TR was added to the culture medium, the TR flu-
orescence was detected at significantly higher levels than in
the previous conditions (Figure 8F compared with Figures 8B
or 8D). Furthermore, the red fluorescence had a punctate
pattern that coincided with that of the immunodetected Tf
(Figures 8E­8G). We performed a qualitative analysis to con-
firm that Tf-TR was co-localized in the same puncta as the
immunodetected Tf by plotting the intensity of the green flu-
orescent pixels of two-dimensional epi-fluorescence images
against the intensity of the red fluorescent pixels (Figure 8G ).
The region of the plot where most pixels contained red and
green fluorescence was selected and used to apply a mask
on the merged images of either experimental condition. The

results indicated that the pixels with the highest green and
red fluorescence had a punctate pattern, as expected for the
Tf internalization (Figure 8G ). Therefore these data rein-
force the fact that the significant increase in the Tf immun-
odetected in the aTf-treated cultures (Figure 8C compared
with Figure 8A) corresponds to the extracellular aTf that was
added to the culture medium.
Further image analysis revealed that some cells in the
Tf-TR treated cultures had a large round-shaped structure
adjacent to the nuclei that seemed to deform or indent the
normal nuclei ovoid shape (Figure 8G, arrowheads). The use of
confocal imaging allowed us to confirm that the Tf+ puncta
resembled the endosomal-mediated entry of Tf into the cells,
and that the Tf puncta was located within the cell cytoplasm
(Figure 8H).
The detection of Tf by ICC was hampered by the HCl
treatment used during the BrdU antigen retrieval protocol
(Figures 8I and 8J) compared with cells that had not been
exposed to the HCl treatment (Figures 8C and 8E). However,
Tf was still clearly detected in the aTf-treated cultures. The Tf
incorporation pattern was not homogenous between treated
cells, since some cells incorporated more Tf than others (Fig-
ure 8J). The BrdU incorporation did not strictly correlate with
the amount of Tf detected in the cells, since not all the
BrdU+ nuclei incorporated large amounts of Tf, nor were all
the strong Tf-labelled cells positive for BrdU.
Effects of Tf overexpression on N20.1 cell
proliferation rates
To evaluate Tf effects on cell proliferation in an alternative
system, we decided to overexpress rat Tf in the murine N20.1
cell line. For BrdU analysis, the cells were transfected and
cultured for 48 h until treatment termination. The Tf over-
expression was analysed by immunodetecting the Tf content
in whole-cell homogenates and in culture medium super-
natants, and indicated that Tf was not only synthesized by

the cells but also followed the canonical secretion pathway
(Figures 9A and 9B). As time progressed after the transfection
protocol, Tf increased in the cultures overexpressing Tf (pEx-
pTf) compared with the control condition (CTL). The amount
of Tf synthesized in the pExpTf cultures was semi-quantified
by WB where known amounts of human aTf were used as
standards. The amount of Tf in the culture medium was sim-
ilar to the aTf concentration used to treat the cell cultures in
the previously described experiments. The quantitative anal-
ysis of strongly labelled Tf+ cells by ICC 48 h after transfec-
tion revealed that the transfection efficiency with the pExpTf
plasmid ranged between 15 and 18% (Figures 9C and 9D).
The BrdU incorporation analysis showed that both Tf+ and
Tf- cells in Tf-overexpressing cultures (48 h after transfec-
tion) incorporated BrdU in similar proportions. As a whole,
Tf-overexpressing cultures had a higher number of BrdU+
nuclei compared with controls (Figure 9F). This suggested
that Tf was increasing the cell proliferation rate in Tf overex-
pressing cells, and paracrinally acting on the non-transfected
neighbouring cells as well.
We further decided to evaluate if the overall cell density
would eventually increase over time in response to the in-
creased cell proliferation. We therefore decided to transfect
the N20.1 cells with linear versions of the CTL and the pExpTf
vectors and culture the transfected cells for 6 days. After the
6th day, the total DNA content of the cultures was quantified
using a fluorometric assay. The DNA fluorometric assay indi-
cated that the cultures overexpressing Tf had increased DNA
amounts compared with the control cultures (Figure 9G).
Effect of iron addition to CTL and aTf-treated
cultures
The aTf treatment of NS and of the N20.1 cell cultures in-
dicated that Tf was able to increase cell proliferation in a
dose-dependent manner, and that at least TfRc1 was in-
volved in this process. However, little is known about the
mechanisms involved. We considered that iron was a plau-
sible candidate responsible for these effects. We used the

2.5 nM and 2.5 M. Datasets represented with white bars correspond to the
control (CTL) treatment, and the datasets in black belong to the aTf treated

quantitative DNA assay to study the effects aTf had on cell
cultures when increasing amounts of ferrous or ferric iron
were added to the N20.1 cells for 6 days. We used a multi-
factorial designed experiment to analyse the influence of iron
on the DNA content of the cells in this culture system. The
two-way ANOVA allowed us not only to analyse the indepen-
dent effects of aTf or iron, but also analyse if the different
iron sources had differential effects on Tf function according
to their concentration in the culture media.
Ferrous addition to cultures in the absence of aTf had a
significant and negative effect on DNA amounts, and was
considered the major source of variation (Figure 10A). The
aTf supplementation was considered a significant source of
variation as well, while there was no evidence to sustain
a possible interaction among the factors (ferrous iron and
aTf). The Bonferroni post-test indicated that the difference
between the CTL and aTf treatment was only significant at
the lowest ferrous iron concentration (asterisk in Figure 10A).
We suppose the ferrous iron addition to the culture media
might be generating an oxidizing environment due to the
free radicals generated from Fenton's reaction that overrides
the effects of aTf when added at the 2.5 nM and 2.5 M
concentrations.
In the case of the ferric citrate treatment, both aTf and
the ferric iron were a significant source of variation (Fig-
ure 10B). Although the effect aTf had on the DNA content
was previously considered significant when adding ferrous
iron, or when analysed by a one-way ANOVA (Figure 7F), the
multifactorial design with a Bonferroni post-test indicated
that the difference between the CTL and aTf treatment was
significant at the 2.5 nM ferric iron concentration (asterisks
in Figure 10B). However, similar to the highest ferrous iron
treatment, high ferric citrate concentrations decreased the
DNA content regardless of aTf supplementation.
DISCUSSION
We decided to evaluate in further depth the effects of Tf on
NS proliferation by using the SVZ tissue belonging to neona-
tal rat pups. We first made sure the amount of aTf added to
the culture medium (100 g/ml) was significantly different
from the endogenous Tf present in either DMEM/F12-B27 or
2% FCS-DMEM/F12. We also determined that the aTf con-
centration used for in vitro treatments closely resembled the
physiological Tf levels found in the brain.
We detected Tf mRNA synthesis in SVZ tissue in vivo as
well as in NS cultures by RT­PCR, suggesting an additional
source for Tf in the brain besides the previously reported
biosynthesis in OL and the choroid plexus (Bloch et al., 1985).
Furthermore, mRNA belonging to TfRc 1 and 2 were detected
as well. In the case of TfRc2, a higher molecular mass PCR
product, other than the expected classic isoforms  and ,
was detected in all tissue samples of neonatal rats, while
a single PCR product was detected in mRNA samples ob-
tained from in vitro cultures. Since the initial aim behind our
experiments was to study the effects of Tf on SVZ-derived
cells in vitro, the detection of the TfRc in the cell cultures
provided compelling evidence that there was an underlying
mechanism through which Tf could exert its effects. Falc~
ao
et al. (2012) have already demonstrated a close relationship
between the secretion of choroid plexus soluble factors to
the CSF and their influence on SVZ cells, including Tf.
The large amounts of Sox2+ nuclei in the SVZ in vivo in-
dicated the NPC identity of the cells in this niche. We found
that the expression of this transcription factor is also main-
tained in vitro. The acetylated -tubulin immunodetection,
together with GFAP and Nestin, provide further evidence
that cells contained within neonatal brain-derived NS are
NPCs, expressing the same markers as adult SVZ type B NPCs
(Mirzadeh et al., 2008).
Cells expressing Olig2 were detected within the SVZ and in
the NS. Although immunopositive cells for Sox2 or Olig2 were
not quantified in vivo, there was a noticeable difference in the
overlapping degree of both transcription factors between
the in vivo and the in vitro cell samples. The higher pro-
portions of Olig2+ cells in the NS suggest a considerable
bias of the SVZ-derived NPC towards glial lineages in vitro
compared with the default neuronal phenotype that pre-
dominates in vivo. This is in agreement with data published
by Brazel et al. (2005), who described phenotypically distinct
mouse brain-derived NS able to generate different propor-
tion of neurons and glia.
The addition of aTf to the culture medium, while NS were
under formation, demonstrated that the size of the NS in-
creased as a function of time compared with untreated cul-
tures. The BrdU incorporation analysis, after normalizing the

data to the NS size, proved that the increase in the sphere
size after aTf treatment was a direct consequence of an incre-
ment in cell proliferation. Besides the fact that Tf seems to be
sufficient to increment NS proliferation, Erickson et al. (2008)
provide additional results supporting Tf as a necessary factor
for NS formation. The use of the anti-TfRc1 antibody with
blocking activity in the NS culture medium demonstrated
that the aTf effects on cell proliferation in this culture sys-
tem were mediated, at least in part, by TfRc1. This finding
is in agreement with Chirasani et al. (2009) who described
a correlation in glioma cells between TfRc expression and
tumour proliferation.
Although we do not demonstrate TfRc1 is expressed at
the protein level in our cultures by WB, the RT­PCR and ICC
results we show are supported by that of Cao et al. (2012)
who used the NPC line C17.2 and stable isotope-labelled
amino acids to quantify membrane proteins under differ-
ent experimental conditions. They observed that one of the
various membrane proteins that significantly vary between
undifferentiated and differentiated cell conditions is TfRc1,
where the protein expression of this particular receptor is
highest in the cells in their undifferentiated state. Accord-
ing to Sergent-Tanguy et al. (2006), 50% of the NPCs that
were obtained from whole brains of 18-day-old rat embryos,
and that were cultured in the form of NS, showed TfRc1
expression.
Since GFAP+ and Nestin+ cells were demonstrated to
have negligible proliferation rates in vitro, we decided to
evaluate if there were other cell types in the SVZ-derived
cultures with higher proliferation rates. Olig2+ nuclei were
numerous in this system and are capable of giving rise to
glial restricted progenitors, among which are OPCs. Surpris-
ingly, besides finding Olig2+ nuclei co-expressing NG2 and
PDGFR, many other Olig2+ nuclei did not express either cell
surface marker, which suggests that Olig2+ cells might have
differentiated to the oligodendroglial lineage and silenced
the expression of NG2 and/or PDGFR. Alternatively, these
cells might be considered progenitors that have not entirely
committed to the oligodendroglial lineage and have not yet
activated the expression of NG2 and PDGFR. Dimou et al.
(2008) have demonstrated that the Olig2+ cells in vivo at
this postnatal stage can give rise both to OL or astrocytes. The
high degree of co-localization among NG2+ and PDGFR+
cells is in agreement with data published by Rivers et al.
(2008), although there were a small proportion of cells that
only expressed either of the two surface markers. These data
allow for speculation regarding the chronological order of
appearance of these two surface markers on OPCs. Further-
more, it highlights the heterogeneity of this particular cell
population in terms of the degree of specification and com-
mitment towards the oligodendroglial lineage. As a whole,
immunodetection of different markers demonstrate that the
SVZ-derived NS assay is a highly heterogeneous system con-
taining different cell types, and contains cells at different
stages along the differentiation pathway of a given neural
lineage.
The in vivo analysis in the brain demonstrated that NG2+
cells were one of the main cell types to incorporate Tf-TR, and
made them interesting putative targets to continue studying
in vitro. The BrdU analysis in dissociated NS cultures rein-
forced our interest in NG2+ and PDGFR+ cells since they
represented a significant proportion of the proliferating cells.
The use of the N20.1 cell line was decided because of the need
for a cell culture system enriched in NG2 and/or PDGFR ex-
pressing cells. The immature OL cell line N20.1 was shown to
respond to the added aTf in the culture medium by increas-
ing the proliferation rate. Moreover, the BrdU incorporation
rate was proven to respond to aTf in a dose-dependent man-
ner. We further included a quantitative DNA assay that could
detect the cumulative effects of the increased cell prolifer-
ation rate in response to aTf, and demonstrated that there
was a discrete increase in DNA amounts after the treatment
compared with the controls.
Besides analysing the expression levels of the TfRc by
RT­PCR in the N20.1 cell line, the use of Tf-TR confirmed
that Tf was readily incorporated into the cells, and was fur-
ther confirmed by the use of confocal microscopy. When Tf
was overexpressed in the N20.1 cell line, Tf was secreted to
the culture medium and continued to have a positive effect
on cell proliferation of neighbouring cells, similar to that
exerted by human aTf. These data imply that Tf has to be
secreted to the culture medium and bind to its receptors on
the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, rather than
acting directly within the cell cytoplasm of Tf-overexpressing
cells.
The role played by iron and its relationship with the aTf
used to supplement the culture medium was analysed by
iron supplementation experiments and evaluating the DNA
content in CTL and aTf-treated N20.1 cells. Previous reports
have demonstrated the negative effect of iron depletion on
cell proliferation in vitro (Renton and Jeitner, 1996; Fu and
Richardson, 2007; Nurtjahja-Tjendraputra et al., 2007)
and in vivo (Richardson, 2005; Steegmann-Olmedillas, 2011).
Iron must be in its ferric form to bind to the Tf protein.
Furthermore, Tf in its diferric form (holoTransferrin) has an
average affinity for its receptor at least 50 times higher than
aTf at a physiological pH. When ferric iron was added to the
culture medium at low doses together with aTf, the DNA
content increased compared with the same treatment lack-
ing aTf, and suggests that ferric iron was able to (i) bind to
Tf and increase its saturation and (ii) promote the binding
to its receptors. However, the addition of higher concentra-
tions of ferric iron to the culture medium did not have the
same effect, and may be indicative of cell damage due to iron
overload.
The possible negative effects of ferrous iron addition to
the culture medium might be related to an oxidative stress
burden mediated by free radical production through the Fen-
ton reaction. The fact that aTf addition to the culture medium
did not reverse the negative effects of the ferrous iron might
be highlighting the inability of iron in its ferrous state to bind
to aTf. It is possible that the cell line might lack an effective

Tf promotes proliferation of SVZ cells
ferroxidase system that oxidizes the ferrous iron to its ferric
form, such as that provided by astroglial ceruloplasmin.
However, further determinations will be needed in the
future to confirm if the effects of Tf on cell proliferation
are mediated in these culture systems by supplying the cells
with the much-required iron for cell cycle progression and
DNA replication (Yu et al., 2007). Other mechanisms might
be involved as well in the proliferation process, such as the
activation of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-
ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) transduc-
tion signalling pathways downstream of the Tf­TfRc2 com-
plex formation (Calzolari et al., 2006). Besides, it would be
interesting to neatly discriminate the weight each of the TfRc
have on proliferation after Tf treatment in culture. A possible
answer might be reached with antibodies with blocking ac-
tivity that recognize TfRc2, or by using interference RNA to
silence either TfRc. In addition, the different TfRc2 isoforms
might have differential roles in SVZ-derived cells in response
to Tf.
Overall, the data presented in this article provide evidence
for the use of Tf in the culture media to improve cell ampli-
fication of SVZ-derived cells, considering their implications
in the upcoming field of NSC (neural stem cell) replacement
therapies for CNS diseases (Low et al., 2008; Kim and de Vel-
lis, 2009; Buchet et al., 2011; Feng and Gao, 2012; G¨
ogel
et al., 2011; Potter et al., 2011). Some treatments have even
been suggested for clinical trials (Trounson et al., 2011). Fur-
thermore, in the industrial biotechnology field there is great
interest in finding alternate components that can replace
animal-derived supplements in culture media, and Tf is one
of them. Human Tf has proven to have a larger growth-
promoting effect than the bovine analogue on human cells
(Brandsma et al., 2011).
The aim of this work is to provide a contribution to the
culturing of neural cells and data that could be considered
when formulating the culture medium for NPC amplification
in vitro.
