Abstract
Background: Several studies have examined the association of biomarkers of iron metabolism
with measures of carotid artery atherosclerosis, with inconsistent results. Few studies, however,
have evaluated the association between biomarkers of iron metabolism and peripheral arterial
disease (PAD). The purpose of this study is to examine the association of ferritin and transferrin
saturation with PAD.
Methods: Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and PAD, defined as having an ankle-brachial
blood pressure index <0.9, were measured in 1,631 men and 1,031 postmenopausal women
participating in the 19992002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Results: The multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for PAD associated with
a two-fold increase in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were 1.18 (1.001.41) and 1.45
(0.832.51), respectively, for men and 1.04 (0.871.25) and 1.55 (0.982.45), respectively, for women.
After stratifying by cholesterol levels, the multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence
intervals) for PAD associated with a two-fold increase in ferritin and transferrin saturation was 1.04
(0.781.39) and 0.73 (0.351.50), respectively, for men with total cholesterol <200 mg/dL and 1.30
(0.991.72) and 2.59 (0.996.78), respectively, for men with total cholesterol  200 mg/dL (p-value
for interaction was 0.58 for ferritin and 0.08 for transferrin saturation). After stratifying by
cholesterol levels, the multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for PAD
associated with a two-fold increase in ferritin and transferrin saturation was 0.66 (0.411.05) and
0.75 (0.441.28), respectively, for women with total cholesterol <200 mg/dL, and 1.20 (0.951.51)
and 2.07 (1.014.22), respectively, for women with total cholesterol  200 mg/dL (p-value for
interaction was 0.05 for ferritin and 0.02 for transferrin saturation).
Conclusion: In this large nationally representative sample of men and postmenopausal women, we
found a modest association of ferritin and transferrin saturation with PAD, particularly among
those with high cholesterol levels.

Background
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a condition character-
ized by advanced atherosclerosis in the lower extremities
[1], affects 5% of US adults aged  40 years and 18% of US
adults aged  75 years [2]. Individuals with atherosclerosis
in the lower extremities are likely to have atherosclerosis
in other arteries placing them at an increased risk of coro-
nary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality [3-6].
Iron has been hypothesized to promote atherosclerosis
based on its ability to catalyze the generation of highly
reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals, through
Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions [7]. There is no consen-
sus in the literature regarding the role of iron in the devel-
opment of atherosclerosis [8]. Several studies have
examined the association of biomarkers of iron metabo-
lism with measures of carotid artery atherosclerosis, with
inconsistent results [9-13]. Few studies, however, have
evaluated the association between biomarkers of iron
metabolism and PAD [8].
The purpose of the current analysis was to evaluate the
association of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation
with the prevalence of PAD, assessed through the ankle-
brachial blood pressure index (ABI), using data from the
19992002 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES 19992002).
Methods
Study Population
NHANES 19992002 was a stratified, multistage probabil-
ity survey designed to select a representative sample of the
civilian non-institutionalized US population [14].
NHANES 19992002 measured ABI in participants aged 
40 years. Of 6,671 adults aged  40 years who participated
in the interview and examination, we excluded 1,475 pre-
menopausal women, 846 participants with anemia (non-
Hispanic black men: hemoglobin <12.5 g/dL; other men:
hemoglobin <13.5 g/dL; non-Hispanic black women:
hemoglobin <11 g/dL; other women: hemoglobin <12 g/
dL), 506 participants taking iron supplements, 10 partici-
pants with likely hemochromatosis (men: serum iron
>190 g/dL, serum ferritin >300 ng/mL, and transferrin
saturation >60%; women: serum iron >175 g/dL, serum
ferritin >200 ng/mL, and transferrin saturation >60%),
123 participants with an ABI  1.3 (a sign of severe arterial
stiffness) [4], 486 participants missing data for ABI, 50
participants missing data for ferritin, 23 participants miss-
ing data for transferrin saturation, and 490 participants
missing other covariate information, the final sample
included 2,662 participants (n = 1631 men and n = 1031
women). Using alternative cutoff points for excluding par-
ticipants with anemia did not materially alter the results
of the study. When participants excluded because of miss-
ing data were compared to those included in the study,
excluded participants were more likely to be older, non-
Hispanic black, and to have a higher body mass index,
lower cholesterol levels, and a higher prevalence of diabe-
tes. The protocol for NHANES 19992002 was approved by
the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention Institutional Review
Board. All participants gave written informed consent.
Data Collection
Data were collected during an in-home interview and a
subsequent visit to a mobile examination center. During
the in-home interview, information on demographic,
household income, education, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, and medication use was collected using a
standardized questionnaire.
Height and weight were measured and body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared. Systolic blood pressure was
determined based on the average of 3 blood pressure
measurements. Participants had a blood specimen drawn
from their antecubital vein by a trained phlebotomist
according to a standardized protocol. Serum C-reactive
protein (CRP) was quantified using latex-enhanced neph-
elometry, a high sensitivity assay. Alanine aminotrans-
ferase (ALT) and total serum cholesterol was measured
enzymatically. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol was measured using a heparin-manganese precipita-
tion method. Serum creatinine was measured by a kinetic
rate Jaffe method. We calculated estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet and
Renal Disease equation after aligning the serum creatinine
concentrations with the assay employed in the develop-
ment of the equation [15,16]. Individuals were classified
as having an eGFR  90, 6089, or <60 ml/min/1.73 m2.
We defined diabetes mellitus as a self-reported history of
diabetes with concurrent use of anti-diabetes medication.
Markers of Iron Metabolism
A detailed description of the measurement of ferritin and
transferrin saturation is available elsewhere [14]. Ferritin
was measured using a single-incubation two-site immu-
noradiometric assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). The software used was not able to quantify ferritin
levels below 5 ng/mL; therefore, participants with ferritin
levels below 5 ng/mL (n = 2) were assigned a value of 3
ng/mL. The inter-assay coefficient of variation ranged
from 2.4% to 5.7% in NHANES 19992000 and 3.8% to
5.1% in NHANES 20012002. Serum iron and total iron-
binding capacity were measured using a modification of
the automated AAII-25 colorimetric method on an Alp-
kem Flow Solutions IV system (Alpkem, Inc., College Sta-
tion, TX). Transferrin saturation was calculated as (iron/
total iron-binding capacity)*100%.

Peripheral Arterial Disease
Systolic blood pressure measurements for ABI determina-
tion were taken via blood pressure cuff on the right bra-
chial artery and both posterior tibial arteries with the
participant lying supine on the exam table. These meas-
urements were taken separately from the measurements to
determine blood pressure. Participants with conditions
preventing measurement in the right arm had the left bra-
chial artery systolic blood pressure measured instead (n =
8). ABI measurements were taken twice for participants
aged 4059 years and once for participants aged  60 years.
Right and left ABI were calculated as the ratio of the mean
systolic blood pressure in the respective ankle to the mean
brachial systolic blood pressure in the arm. Participants
with an ABI <0.9 in either leg were considered to have
PAD. The 0.9 cutoff value for ABI has 95% sensitivity for
detecting angiogram positive disease and almost 100%
specificity in excluding healthy individuals [17].
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted separately for men and post-
menopausal women. Participants were categorized into
gender-specific tertiles of ferritin and transferrin satura-
tion based on the weighted population distribution. Age
and race-ethnicity adjusted means and percentages were
calculated by linear regression for continuous covariates
and logistic regression for dichotomous covariates.
We calculated the odds ratios of PAD associated with ter-
tile of ferritin and transferrin saturation after multivaria-
ble adjustment using logistic regression. Initial models
adjusted for age (continuous) and race-ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American,
other). Subsequent models further adjusted for house-
hold income (<$20,000 and  $20,000), high school edu-
cation, smoking status (current, former, never), alcohol
consumption (<1 and  1 drink per week), and body mass
index (<25, 2529, and  30 kg/m2). Additional models
further adjusted for systolic blood pressure (continuous),
high sensitivity C-reactive protein (log-transformed, con-
tinuous), ALT (log-transformed, continuous), total cho-
lesterol (continuous), high-density lipoprotein-
cholesterol (continuous), estimated glomerular filtration
rate (<60, 6089, and  90 ml/min/1.73 m2), diabetes mel-
litus, use of blood pressure medication, diabetes medica-
tion, aspirin, and hormone replacement therapy (among
women). Tests for linear trend across tertiles of ferritin
and transferrin saturation were computed by including an
ordinal variable with the median of each tertile of ferritin
or transferrin in the regression models. Further analyses
included ferritin and transferrin saturation as continuous,
log-transformed variables. For these analyses, we present
odds ratios for PAD associated with a two-fold increase in
ferritin or transferrin saturation. The analysis of ferritin
and transferrin saturation as continuous, log-transformed
variables was repeated after stratifying by total cholesterol
levels above and below 200 mg/dL to investigate the
potential interaction with cholesterol levels as has been
reported in previous studies [11,18-20].
Data were analyzed using SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account
for the complex NHANES sampling design, including
unequal probabilities of selection, over-sampling, and
non-response.
Results
The geometric mean ferritin and transferrin saturation lev-
els were 148 ng/mL and 25.8%, respectively, for men and
81 ng/mL and 21.9%, respectively, for women. The prev-
alence of PAD was 4% for men and 8% for post-menopau-
sal women. Among men, PAD was associated with being
older, being non-Hispanic black, having low income,
being a current smoker, having higher CRP, having lower
ALT, and having an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (Table 1).
Among women, PAD was associated with being older,
being non-Hispanic black, being a former smoker, having
a lower HDL-cholesterol level, and having an eGFR <60
ml/min/1.73 m2.
Among men, the multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95%
confidence intervals) for PAD comparing the highest to
the lowest tertiles of ferritin and transferrin saturation
were 1.87 (0.963.63) and 1.48 (0.822.64), respectively
(Table 2). The multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95%
confidence intervals) for PAD associated with a two-fold
increase in ferritin and transferrin saturation were 1.18
(1.001.41) and 1.45 (0.832.51), respectively. After strati-
fying by cholesterol levels, the multivariable adjusted
odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for PAD associated
with a two-fold increase in ferritin and transferrin satura-
tion was 1.04 (0.781.39) and 0.73 (0.351.50), respec-
tively, for men with total cholesterol <200 mg/dL and
1.30 (0.991.72) and 2.59 (0.996.78), respectively, for
men with total cholesterol  200 mg/dL (p-value for inter-
action was 0.58 for ferritin and 0.08 for transferrin satura-
tion).
Among women the multivariable adjusted odds ratios
(95% confidence intervals) for PAD comparing the high-
est to the lowest tertiles of ferritin and transferrin satura-
tion were 0.77 (0.461.30) and 1.29 (0.792.10),
respectively (Table 2). The multivariable adjusted odds
ratios (95% confidence intervals) for PAD associated with
a two-fold increase in ferritin and transferrin saturation
were 1.04 (0.871.25) and 1.55 (0.982.45), respectively.
After stratifying by cholesterol levels, the multivariable
adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for PAD
associated with a two-fold increase in ferritin and transfer-
rin saturation were 0.66 (0.411.05) and 0.75 (0.441.28),

respectively, for women with total cholesterol <200 mg/
dL and 1.20 (0.951.51) and 2.07 (1.014.22), respectively,
for women with total cholesterol  200 mg/dL (p-value
for interaction was 0.05 for ferritin and 0.02 for transfer-
rin saturation).
Discussion
In this representative sample of US adult men and post-
menopausal women, ferritin and transferrin saturation
were not statistically significantly associated with PAD.
After stratifying the analysis by cholesterol levels, the
observed associations were consistent with a synergistic
interaction between ferritin and transferrin saturation
with cholesterol levels among men and women. Our find-
ings were consistent with a modest association of ferritin
and transferrin saturation with PAD, particularly among
those with high cholesterol levels, but we cannot exclude
a chance association.
In 1981 Sullivan [21] introduced the hypothesis that ele-
vated iron levels, below the levels found in hemochroma-
tosis, may increase cardiovascular risk. This hypothesis
was based on the observation that premenopausal women
had lower rates of heart disease compared to men and this
difference narrowed in concert with increasing iron levels
as women went through menopause. The human body
carefully maintains iron homeostasis, as both iron defi-
ciency and iron overload are harmful [8]. Nearly all iron
in the human body is bound to other molecules since free
ferrous iron is highly reactive and may catalyze free-radi-
cal oxidative reactions. Free ferrous iron may be involved
in the Fenton or Haber-Weiss reactions and catalyze the
formation of hydroxyl radicals, which have been impli-
cated in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol oxida-
tion. As a consequence, it has also been hypothesized that
excess iron may be more harmful in those with elevated
LDL cholesterol than those with lower LDL cholesterol
[8].
While there is limited information in the literature on the
association of iron with PAD, several studies have evalu-
ated the association of iron with carotid artery atheroscle-
rosis. In the Bruneck Study of 826 men and women, high
ferritin levels were associated with greater progression of
carotid artery atherosclerosis after 5 years [11]. In the Bru-
neck Study, the ferritin-carotid artery atherosclerosis rela-

tionship was significantly stronger at higher levels of LDL
cholesterol. Conversely, a cross-sectional study of 206
Finnish men [13] and a case-control analysis of 730 men
and women participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) study found no association
between ferritin and carotid artery atherosclerosis [12]. In
the ARIC study, there was no evidence to support a syner-
gistic interaction between ferritin and cholesterol; in fact,
the cholesterol stratified results indicated a lower odds
ratio of carotid atherosclerosis among those with higher
cholesterol levels.
The association of biomarkers of iron metabolism with
coronary heart disease or stroke has been a source of sub-
stantial controversy [18-20,22-28]. A meta-analysis of 12
prospective studies found no evidence to support an asso-
ciation between biomarkers of iron metabolism and cor-
onary heart disease [29]. Three prospective studies
investigating the association of measures of iron metabo-
lism and myocardial infarction have found evidence of
synergistic interaction with cholesterol levels [18-20], but
other similar studies have failed to find evidence of inter-
action [22,24]. Recently, a multicenter randomized con-
trolled trial was conducted with 1,277 men and
postmenopausal women randomized to either a control
group or to receive phlebotomy at six-month intervals to
reduce body iron stores; at the end of the six year follow-
up, all-cause mortality and the secondary endpoint of all-
cause mortality plus nonfatal myocardial infarction and
stroke were nonsignificantly lower in the phlebotomy
group [30].
The findings from the present study need to be considered
in the context of its limitations. Ferritin and transferrin
saturation are acute-phase reactants and may not accu-
rately reflect body iron stores. To minimize this potential

determine causality in any observed associations. There
were relatively few cases of PAD, limiting our ability to
detect modest associations and subjecting our findings to
substantial random variability. Also, when investigating a
possible interaction between ferritin and cholesterol lev-
els, the use of LDL cholesterol would have been preferable
to total cholesterol, but fasting LDL cholesterol was only
available in 47% of our study participants. Despite these
limitations, the present study maintains a number of
strengths. NHANES data were collected using a rigorous
study protocol with extensive quality control procedures
and with technicians trained and certified in all data col-
lection procedures. Additionally, the results are represent-
ative of the US noninstitutionalized civilian population.
Conclusion
In a large nationally representative sample of US adults,
we found a modest association of ferritin and transferrin
saturation with PAD, particularly among those with high
cholesterol levels, but we cannot exclude a chance associ-
ation. After stratifying the analysis by cholesterol levels,
the associations were also consistent with a synergistic
interaction of cholesterol levels with ferritin and transfer-
rin saturation. Prospective cohort studies with adequate
power to investigate ferritin-cholesterol interaction are
needed to fully characterize the relationship between
biomarkers of iron status, cholesterol, and measures of
atherosclerosis.
