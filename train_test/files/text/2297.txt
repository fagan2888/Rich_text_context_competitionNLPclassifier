Abstract
Background: Because of the magnitude of the global tobacco epidemic, the World Health Organisation developed
the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), an international legally binding treaty to control tobacco
use. Adoption and implementation of specific tobacco control measures within FCTC is an outcome of a political
process, where social norms and public opinion play important roles. The objective of our study was to examine
how a country's level of tobacco control is associated with smoking prevalence, two markers of denormalisation of
smoking (social disapproval of smoking and concern about passive smoking), and societal support for tobacco control.
Methods: An ecological study was conducted, using data from two sources. The first source was the Tobacco Control
Scale (TCS) from 2011, which quantifies the implementation of tobacco control policies in European Union (EU)
countries. Data on smoking prevalence, societal disapproval of smoking, concern about passive smoking, and societal
support for policy measures were taken from the Eurobarometer survey of 2009. Data from Eurobarometer surveys
were aggregated to country level. Data from the 27 European Union member states were used.
Results: Smoking prevalence rates in 2009 were negatively associated with a country's TCS 2011 score, although not
statistically significant (r = -.25; p = .21). Experience of societal disapproval was positively associated with higher TCS
scores, though not significantly (r = .14; p = .48). The same was true for societal support for tobacco control (r = .27;
p = .18). The TCS score in 2011 was significantly correlated with concern about passive smoking (r = .42; p =.03).
Support for tobacco control measures was also strongly correlated with concern about passive smoking (r = .52, p = .006).
Conclusions: Smokers in countries with a higher TCS score were more concerned about whether their smoke harms
others. Further, support for tobacco control measures is higher in countries that have more of these concerned smokers.
Concerns about passive smoking seem central in the implementation of tobacco control measures, stressing the
importance of continuing to educate the public about the harm from passive smoking.

Background
Tobacco use continues to cause death, disease, and
disability worldwide [1]. Rates of smoking have levelled
off or declined in the developed world, while they are
increasing in the developing world [2]. Because of the
magnitude of the tobacco epidemic, the WHO developed
the first legally binding international treaty on public
health, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
(FCTC) [3]. When this treaty went into force in February
2005, governments throughout the world committed to
implement a minimum set of tobacco control measures,
but were also expected to go beyond that, following add-
itional FCTC Guidelines. Governments now have a wide
range of interventions at their disposal to reduce tobacco
use, such as adopting high cigarette taxes, banning
tobacco advertising and promotion, creating smoke-free
public places and worksites, introducing health warnings
on cigarette packs, and implementing mass media cam-
paigns to educate about the harm from tobacco. How-
ever, more than five years after FCTC came into effect,

large differences in implementation levels exist among
FCTC ratifying countries [4].
A large and still growing body of literature exists
within public health and related disciplines, describing
the effectiveness and impact of tobacco control interven-
tions on smoking and health [5-8]. There also is a grow-
ing body of literature, predominantly from political
sciences, examining how these tobacco control interven-
tions come about in diverse social and political contexts.
Adoption and implementation of specific tobacco con-
trol interventions is thought to be primarily the outcome
of a political process [9-11], where social norms and
public opinion may play an important role. Jacobson and
Zapawa argue that changes towards more restrictive
civil norms regarding smoking facilitate the enactment
of legislation, while laws institutionalize nascent civil
norms and contribute to a social climate that dis-
courages smoking [12]. Kagan and Nelson, in a discus-
sion of the politics of tobacco regulation in the United
States, conclude that, on balance, US tobacco policy
reflects shifts in public opinion [13]. A central factor in
explaining both the effect of policies on smoking and
explaining how these policies originate in society is the
concept of denormalisation. Chapman recently argued
that "there is a dynamic, synergistic relationship be-
tween formal tobacco control interventions and policies,
falling smoking prevalence and the increasing range and
growth of markers [of denormalisation of tobacco]" [14].
An important aspect besides denormalisation is level
of support for policies in the general population. Support
for smoke-free legislation is an important determinant of
compliance with the legislation [15,16]. Studies found
that support for tobacco policies, particularly smoke-
free legislation, further increases after implementation
[16,17]. However, few studies looked at the association
between level of societal support for tobacco control
and countries' tobacco control policy level.
The objective of our study was to examine how a
country's level of tobacco control is associated with mar-
kers of denormalisation of smoking, smoking prevalence,
and societal support for tobacco control. We conducted
an ecological study, using country as the unit of analysis.
The European Union provides a good setting for such a
study, because tobacco control implementation data are
available from the Tobacco Control Scale (TCS) [18],
while Eurobarometer surveys [19] provide data on
denormalisation, smoking prevalence, and support for
tobacco control. A recent study reported on the associ-
ation between the 2007 TCS score and 2009 Eurobarom-
eter data on smoking prevalence, self-reported exposure
to passive smoking, and support for smoking bans [20].
They found that TCS scores were negatively (although
not statistically significant) associated with smoking
prevalence and positively (and significantly) associated
with public support for smoking bans in workplaces.
However, they did not examine support for other policies
nor markers of denormalisation. We investigated the
associations between the more recent 2011 TCS score
with Eurobarometer data on societal support for tobacco
control measures, smoking prevalence, and markers of
denormalisation of smoking.
Methods
The TCS is based on the six most effective and import-
ant tobacco control policies according to the World
Bank [18]. A questionnaire was sent to correspondents
in all European countries, using a scoring system [18].
This scoring system was developed by a panel of experts
who agreed on the allocation of points to the scale and
decided on what weight should be given to policies in
the scale, reflecting the relative effectiveness of each
policy. The maximum score is 100, with subscales for
price (maximum 30 points), public place bans (max-
imum 22 points), public information campaign spending
(maximum 15 points), advertising bans (maximum 13
points), health warnings (maximum 10 points), and
treatment (10 maximum points). For the present study,
the total score was used. Data were taken from the
2011 scale [21].
Smoking prevalence data were from the Special
Eurobarometer 332, which had fieldwork data conducted
in October 2009 [19]. Eurobarometer surveys are period-
ically conducted by the Gallup Organisation in the
27 countries of the EU, for the European Commission.
The Eurobarometer uses a multi-stage random sample
design. In each country, a number of sampling points
was drawn with probability proportional to population
size and population density. In each of the selected
sampling points, a starting address was randomly
drawn. Further addresses were selected by standard ran-
dom route procedures, from the initial address. In each
household, the respondent was randomly drawn, follow-
ing the closest birthday rule. Samples sizes varied
between 500 (Malta) to 1,550 (Germany), and included
all those aged 15 years and older. Interviews are con-
ducted via face-to-face in people's homes. For all coun-
tries, a national weighting procedure was carried that
took into account country distributions with respect to
gender, age, region and size of locality.
Smoking prevalence was measured in respondents
aged 15 years and older with the following question:
"Regarding smoking cigarettes, cigars or a pipe, which of
the following applies to you?". Respondents with an
affirmative answer to the option ". . .you smoke at the
present time" were regarded to be a smoker.
The Special Eurobarometer 332 includes two items
that can be regarded as markers of tobacco denormalisa-
tion. The first is Societal disapproval of smoking, which
Willemsen et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:876 Page 2 of 6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/876
is measured with the question: "Has any of the following
things led you to think about quitting in the last 12
months . . .. The society disapproves of smoking?" (Yes,
No). This item was also used in other studies as an indi-
cator of the social denormalisation of smoking [22-24].
The other item is Concern about passive smoking,
measured with the question "Has any of the following
things led you to think about quitting in the last
12 months . . .Concern about the effect of your smoke
on non-smokers?" (Yes / No). Both items were mea-
sured among smokers who made a quit attempt in the
last 12 months.
Data on societal support for policy measures were
obtained from the Eurobarometer with four questions:
"Would you be in favour of or opposed to any of the fol-
lowing measures?" (1) Banning display and advertising of
tobacco products in points of sales / shops; (2) Banning
the sales of tobacco products via the Internet; (3) Putting
picture health warnings on all packages of tobacco pro-
ducts; (4) Increasing taxes on tobacco products. Answer-
ing categories on these four questions were: "In favour"
and "Opposed". A scale was formed with a Cronbach's
Alpha of 0.77. These questions were answered by all
respondents.
The Central Committee on Research Involving Human
Subjects in the Netherlands requires no ethical approval
for non-medical survey research.
Analyses
The relationships between TCS scores, smoking preva-
lence, the two markers of tobacco denormalisation,
and societal support were first examined by means of
Pearson's correlation coefficient and scatter-plots. Next,
multiple regression analyses were conduced to examine
predictors of TCS 2011 score and predictors of support
for tobacco control. We checked for multicollinearity by
examining variance inflation factors. For all analyses,
SPSS statistical package version 19 was used.
Results
Smoking prevalence varied between 16% (Sweden) and
42% (Greece), with mean 29.5% (Sd = 5.8). Societal dis-
approval as a reason for quitting varied between 10%
(France, Slovenia) and 42% (Slovakia), with mean 21.3%
(Sd 8.4). Concern about passive smoking as a reason to
quit varied between 12% (Sweden) and 55% (Ireland),
with mean 32.9% (Sd 10.1). Societal support for tobacco
control policies was lowest in Austria (51) and highest in
Cyprus (80), with mean 62.2 (SD 8.1).
The correlations between the study variables are pre-
sented in Table 1. Smoking prevalence rates in 2009
were negatively associated with a country's Tobacco
Control Scale score in 2011, although not statistically
significant (r = -.25; p = .21). The TCS 2011 score was
significantly correlated with concern about passive
smoking (r = .42; p = .03), meaning that smokers who said
that they quit smoking due to concerns about how
their smoke affects others, were more likely to live in a
country with a more advanced 2011 TCS score. This
association is graphically illustrated in Figure 1. This
association remained borderline significant in a regression
analysis predicting 2011 TCS scores (p = .07), after con-
trolling for social disapproval, societal support, and smok-
ing prevalence (Table 2). Inspection of the scatterplot
(Figure 1) reveals that two countries have a strong
influence on the total distribution. These are the UK and
Ireland, both having a high TCS score and a high propor-
tion of smokers saying that they have quit because of con-
cern about passive smoking. The association is no longer
significant without these two countries.
The data presented in Table 1 further reveal that
experience of societal disapproval was positively asso-
ciated with higher TCS scores, but the correlation was
not significant (r = .14; p = .48). The same was true for
societal support for tobacco control (r = .27; p = .18).
Support for tobacco control measures was strongly cor-
related with concern about passive smoking (r = .52,
p = .006). This remained significant after controlling for
proportion of smokers and social disapproval of smok-
ing in a regression analysis (Table 3).
Discussion
A previous ecological study found that EU countries
with a higher overall TCS score have higher public sup-
port for smoke-free legislation (smoking bans) [20]. Our
study adds to this with two important findings. First,
smokers in EU countries with higher TCS scores are
more concerned about the effect of their smoke on

others, which can be regarded as a marker of tobacco
denormalisation. Second, support for tobacco control
measures is higher in countries that have more of these
concerned smokers. Together, these findings support the
idea that the issue of passive smoking is central to
tobacco control in Europe. Our data also suggest that
there are still large differences within Europe. The fact
that the association between TCS score and concern
about passive smoking depends heavily on two countries
(the UK and Ireland) which both have a very high TCS
score, suggests that these two countries have been much
more successful in advancing the implementation of the
FCTC measures alongside denormalizing tobacco use,
than the rest of Europe.
Despite the paucity of ecological data in the scien-
tific literature, the importance of level of concern
about passive smoking was already acknowledged dec-
ades ago by the tobacco industry. They initiated social
accommodation programs and started covert attempts
to deceive the public about the health risks from expos-
ure to tobacco smoke [25], creating controversy about
what they called `the smoking issue' [26]. In 1998, a
research firm drafted a report, commissioned by Philip
Morris, describing and comparing ecological data which
they had collected on attitudes towards smoking in a
large number of countries across the world [27]. They
looked at the relationship between concern about pas-
sive smoking and the desire for further restrictions on
smoking, finding a strong correlation between the two
factors. The authors commented that "this is much
stronger than any other driving factor such as social
acceptability or disliking the smell". The industry used
these data to tailor their efforts to normalize smoking
on a country-to-country basis.
Although the two markers of denormalisation were
strongly correlated (r = .47; p = .01), they were not
equally strongly associated with the TCS score. The item

`concern about passive smoking' showed a high correl-
ation (r = .42; p = .03), but the item measuring `social
disapproval of smoking' was only moderately and not
significantly associated with TCS scores (r = .14; ns).
This suggests that more elaborate measures of tobacco
de-normalization are needed. We therefore recommend
developing and including well validated, comprehensive
measures of tobacco de-normalization in future popula-
tion surveys.
We found a negative association between a country's
TCS score and the proportion of smokers (r = -.25),
albeit not statistically significant (p = .21). This com-
pares well to the results from a previous ecological study
using the same number of 27 countries, but comparing
the TCS 2007 data with Eurobarometer 2008 data, that
found a correlation of -.32 (p = .11) between TCS score
and proportion of daily smokers [20]. Both studies prob-
ably suffer from the small sample size (N = 27). Another
factor obscuring any true association between the two
variables might be the low reliability of Eurobarometer
surveys. A recent study comparing smoking prevalence
proportions from the Eurobarometer 2006 with data
from national bureaux of statistics of the 27 EU coun-
tries, found large discrepancies, probably due to the
inadequate sample sizes in Eurobarometer surveys which
hamper an accurate estimation of the proportion of
smokers [28].
The study has some limitations. Although the
tobacco control score was measured two years after the
Eurobarometer scores, it seems not justified to infer
strong causality from our ecological data. Although this
seems less likely, we cannot rule out the possibility that
adoption of more stringent tobacco control policies leads
to people becoming more aware and concerned about
the harmfulness of smoking. Longitudinal data with rep-
resentative samples of the population are needed to
really disentangle direction of causality and such studies
are very much needed. Nevertheless, the fact that the
Eurobarometer data preceded the tobacco control score
provides some reassurance that concern about passive
smoking does indeed drive the implementation of more
stringent tobacco control measures. Finally, we cannot
rule out the possibility that the association between TCS
score and level of concern about passive smoking
reflects common underlying factors which have not been
controlled for, such as political and cultural differences.
Conclusion
We used ecological data to examine tobacco denormali-
sation, an important emerging topic in the field of
tobacco control. Our assumption was that countries that
have higher levels of tobacco denormalisation would
have more advanced tobacco control policies. Our find-
ings suggest that this might be true for one marker of
denormalisation, i.e. level of concern about the harm
from passive smoking. This also suggests that it remains
vital to educate the public about the harm from passive
smoking. Even in some developed countries, the aware-
ness of the risks from passive smoking can still be
alarmingly low. For example, a recent study found that
in the Netherlands only 61% of smokers agree that
cigarette smoke is dangerous to non-smokers, whereas
this was 83% in the UK, and 96% in France [29].
