Sleep is a contributing factor to optimal health and vitality.
However, to date, no national study has evaluated the
simultaneous relationship between sleep disorders, quality,
and duration with hypertension. Using data from National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2005
to 2008), hypertension was defined by current use of anti-
hypertensive medication or systolic blood pressure
140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg.
Self-reported sleep disorders and duration were catego-
rized from a single household interview question, and sleep
quality was determined from several questions on sleeping
habits. The prevalence of hypertension was 30.2% and
7.5%, and 33.0% and 52.1% reported having sleep disor-
ders, short sleep, and poor sleep, respectively. After
adjustment for demographic characteristics and comorbid-
ities, having sleep disorders only was not significantly
associated with hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.73)3.77). However, this associa-
tion was modified by sleep duration: significant associa-
tions were observed among adults with concurrent sleep
disorders and short sleep (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.49)3.56)
and with sleep disorders, short sleep, and poor sleep (OR,
1.84; 95% CI, 1.13)2.98). These findings indicate an asso-
ciation between a combination of sleep problems and
hypertension, but prospective studies are needed to
understand the complex interplay between them. J Clin

An estimated 1 in 3 adults in the United States has
hypertension.1 Although the major risk factors for
hypertension, including family history, sedentary life-
style, poor diet, cigarette smoking, sex, race, and age,
have been widely established,1 one unconventional and
often overlooked risk factor is sleep. Sleep is essential
for optimal health and vitality, but a 2008 study by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
found, based on self-reports, that 11% of adults in the
United States got insufficient rest or sleep.2 Given its
importance, it is not surprising that researchers have
found an association between poor quality of sleep
and negative health behaviors and outcomes.3,4 For
example, several studies have shown a link between
short sleep and hypertension among adults, with this
association differing by sex (higher among women)
and age (no association among the elderly aged 58­
98 years).5­9 Furthermore, similar associations with
hypertension have been documented for specific sleep
disorders (apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome)10­13
and for the quality of sleep.14
To date, findings of the studies performed have been
somewhat limited because of variations in study popu-
lations and study designs, small samples, and a focus
largely on one sleep abnormality at a time and its rela-
tion with hypertension. Thus, the present study was
designed to describe the distribution of demographic
and health characteristics by hypertension status and
to examine the simultaneous association of sleep disor-
ders, the duration of sleep, and sleep quality on hyper-
tension among US adults.
METHODS
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES), a continuous series of cross-sectional
surveys based on nationally representative samples of
the US civilian noninstitutionalized population, uses a
complex, stratified, multistage sampling design to
recruit participants from clusters of households.15 In
NHANES, participants undergo a detailed home inter-
view, followed by a physical examination and labora-
tory evaluation at a local mobile examination center
(MEC). The present study analyzed NHANES data
from the 2005 to 2006 and 2007 to 2008 study cycles.
Among 11,791 eligible adults 18 years and older, 390
were excluded because of pregnancy, 1061 were
dropped because of missing data on blood pressure
(BP), and 32 were pregnant and lacking a measure-
ment of BP, yielding a final analytic sample of 10,308
men and women. Informed consent was obtained from
all participants, and the protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of the National Center for
Health Statistics.
Sleep disorders were identified by a response of
``yes'' to the household interview question ``Have you
ever been told that you have a sleep disorder?'' Indi-
viduals that answered ``yes'' were asked to specify the
type of sleep disorder (sleep apnea, insomnia, restless
legs, and other). The duration of sleep was assessed by

the reported number of hours and minutes usually
slept on weekday or workday nights. Based on the
national recommendations for sleep, a cutpoint of
<7 hours was used to categorize individuals as sleep
deprived (``short sleep'' in this study). Participants
were classified as having poor sleep (poor quality) if
they answered ``often'' or ``almost always'' (together
defined as 5­30 times a month) to any of the 6 items
on sleeping habits as follows: (1) having trouble falling
asleep; (2) waking up during the night and having
trouble getting back to sleep; (3) waking up too early
in the morning and being unable to get back to sleep;
(4) feeling unrested during the day, no matter how
many hours of sleep were obtained; (5) feeling exces-
sively or overly sleepy during the day; and (6) not get-
ting enough sleep. To assess the combined associations
of sleep disorders, short sleep, and poor sleep, a com-
posite sleep variable was created with 8 mutually
exclusive categories: (1) sleep disorder, short sleep,
and poor sleep; (2) sleep disorder and short sleep; (3)
sleep disorder and poor sleep; (4) sleep disorder only;
(5) short sleep and poor sleep; (6) short sleep only; (7)
poor sleep only; and (8) none of the above.
Participants were defined as having hypertension if
they met any of 3 criteria: mean systolic BP (SBP)
140 mm Hg, mean diastolic BP (DBP) 90 mm Hg,
or currently taking prescription medication to lower
high BP. The average of up to 3 brachial BP readings
was obtained at the visit for the physical examination.
According to the standard protocol for both NHANES
cycles, trained physicians measured the BP using a cuff
size appropriate for the participant.15 Additional vari-
ables of interest in this analysis were body mass index
(BMI; weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared), diabetes (participant had ever been told that
she/he had diabetes), and current smoker (reported
smoking cigarettes every day or some days).
Demographic information obtained from the inter-
view included sex, age in years (18­39, 40­59, and 60
and older), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other). The
poverty-income ratio (PIR), which is the ratio of a
family's income to the federally defined poverty
threshold for a family of the same size in the same
calendar year, was used as a proxy for socioeconomic
status. A cutpoint of 1.00 for the PIR was used to
differentiate persons living below the federal pov-
erty level (PIR <1.00) from those living at (1.00
PIR3.00) or above the federal poverty level (PIR >
3.00).
To assess the stability of our estimates, relative stan-
dard errors (RSEs) were calculated. Any estimates with
an RSE >0.30 were suppressed. Statistical hypotheses
were tested using chi-square tests (with a significance
level of P=.05), and logistic regression was employed
to estimate the likelihood of hypertension in adults by
individual and combined sleep problems. All statistical
analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC) to account for the complex design of the
NHANES sample.
RESULTS
Among the eligible 10,308 study participants, 3587
(30.2%) had hypertension, and the overall prevalence
of sleep disorders, short sleep, and poor sleep was
7.5%, 33.0%, and 52.1%, respectively (Table I). Of
those with sleep disorders, sleep apnea was the most
common type of sleep disorder (4.4%), followed by
insomnia (1.2%), restless leg syndrome (1.2%), and
other or unknown sleep disorders (0.7%) (data not
shown). In addition, 6.5% of those with a sleep disor-
der had concurrent short and poor sleep (data not
shown).
Compared with normotensive adults, those with
hypertension were more likely (P for all comparisons
<.001) to be obese (46% vs 28%) but less likely to be
current smokers (19% vs 24%) (Table I). In addition,
hypertensive adults had a higher prevalence of sleep
disorders (11% vs 6%; P<.001) and were more likely
to sleep <7 hours (35% vs 32%; P<.02), but there
was no difference in the prevalence of poor sleep
(P<.78) (Table I).
Among hypertensive adults (data not shown), find-
ings included the following: having a sleep disorder
was significantly more common among middle-aged
(15%, aged 40­59) than it was among young (10%)
or older adults (9%) (P=.01). No significant difference
in the presence of a sleep disorder was observed by
sex (P=.15) or race /ethnicity (P=.54), but short sleep
was significantly more common among older individu-
als (60 and older, 42.7%) and non-Hispanic whites
(37.3%) than it was in their comparison groups.
Finally, poor sleep was more common in women
(58.6%) than men and in non-Hispanic whites
(53.3%) than in the other groups.
The prevalence of hypertension differed by individ-
ual and combined sleep problems. Hypertension
among adults with sleep disorders, short sleep, and
poor sleep was 44.7%, 31.7%, and 30.3%, respec-
tively (Table II). Among combined sleep problems, the
prevalence of hypertension was the highest among
adults with sleep disorders and short sleep (61.5%),
followed by those with only sleep disorders (55.8%),
and sleep disorders, short sleep, and poor sleep
(49.7%) (Table II).
When taking into account individual associations,
adults with sleep disorders were 1.36 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.05)1.77) times more likely to have
hypertension as adults with no sleep-related issues
after adjustment for sex, age, race, poverty status,
BMI, diabetes, and smoking. No significant association
was observed among adults with short sleep or poor
sleep (Table II). On the other hand, after adjustment
for sex, age, race, poverty status, BMI, diabetes, and
smoking, adults with sleep disorders were only 1.65
(95% C], 0.77)3.77) times more likely to have hyper-
tension as adults with no sleep-related problems. No

only short sleep or poor sleep (Table II). Adults with
all 3 sleep-related problems (sleep disorders, short
sleep, and poor sleep) were 1.84 (95% CI, 1.13)2.98)
times as likely to have hypertension as adults with
none of these issues. Among adults with 2 sleep prob-
lems, only those with both sleep disorders and
short sleep were significantly more likely to have

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first national study to
examine the joint associations of sleep disorders, short
sleep, and poor sleep on the prevalence of hyperten-
sion among adults in the United States. We found no
relationship between having a sleep disorder and
hypertension if short sleep and/or poor sleep was not
also present. Among people with both a sleep disorder
and short sleep, however, we found that the likelihood
of hypertension was slightly more than twice that for
people with no sleep problems at all. This relationship
may, in part, be the result of biologic mechanisms,
suggesting that sleep deprivation may alter cortisol
stress hormones and the sympathetic nervous system,
resulting in elevated BP.16,17 On the other hand, our
findings may reflect the growing trends in obesity and
diabetes, as evidence indicates a high and increasing
prevalence of hypertension and sleep-related problems
among those with these conditions.14,16,18
The lack of association between having a sleep dis-
order (considered individually) and hypertension in
our study is inconsistent with findings from several
previous studies.10­13,17,18 This may be explained by
the fact that a large number of adults, in general, are
likely to experience and report an occasional short
sleep or poor sleep as compared with having a sleep
disorder, which often requires a physician diagnosis
based on the presence of a number of characteristic
symptoms. Further, the fact that we examined all types
of sleep disorders, collectively, rather than individu-
ally, may have diluted the magnitude of this associa-
tion. While evidence indicates that sleep apnea, the
most common sleep disorder identified in our study,
independently influences the development of hyperten-
sion by a factor of three,9,10,16 findings from recent
studies have shown that insomnia and restless leg syn-
drome are strongly (up to 5 times) associated with
hypertension.12,13
Although our results demonstrate that sleep prob-
lems are common, they are a potentially treatable risk
factor for cardiovascular morbidity. However, a recent
poll found that only 32% of adults have ever discussed
their problems regarding sleep with their health care
professional.19 In 1994, US consumers spent an esti-
mated $8.4 million on sleep clinics and $285 million
on benzodiazepines as sleep aids,20 demonstrating a
common problem that lowers quality of life. The fact
that only 54% of 116 US medical schools offer train-
ing in sleep physiology, and only 38% offer as much
as 1 to 4 hours of lecture on this topic, further indi-
cates that sleep-related problems may be overlooked in
primary care.20 Hence, it would be useful for health
care professionals to be educated on how to ade-
quately diagnose and manage both sleep disorders and
disturbances among adults. Moreover, findings from a
recent study showing that low efficiency of sleep is
highly associated with both prehypertension and
hypertension in adolescents suggests that screening
needs to start early in life.21

LIMITATIONS
The present study has several limitations. First,
because of the cross-sectional design we could not
determine a causal relationship or rule out bidirec-
tional relationships between sleep and hypertension. In
addition, it is likely that BP measurements were sub-
ject to the white-coat effect. Given that white-coat
hypertension may affect up to 20% of all diagnosed
cases of hypertension,22 the observed associations
between sleep disorders and hypertension may be
underestimated in this study. Further, sleep disorders,
duration of sleep, and sleep quality were elicited from
self-reported questions and thus they may have been
subject to recall bias. We note that a validity study
that compared self-reported and actigraph-measured
duration of sleep found only a moderate correlation
(0.47), and there was systematic overreporting by an
average of 34 minutes for each additional hour slept.23
Thus, there is a potential for misclassification and
underdiagnosis of the duration of sleep in our study.
CONCLUSIONS
As sleep habits may be a marker for health status and
quality of life, prospective studies are needed to better
understand the complex interplay between sleep and
hypertension. While some intervention studies to
improve the duration and quality of sleep have been
effective in reducing both daytime and nighttime BPs,9
additional studies that examine the effect of the length
and severity of any type of sleep-related problems on
hypertension may be of added value.
