Body fat distribution and hypertension
incidence in women and men
The NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study
RF Gillum, ME Mussolino and JH Madans
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD, USA
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that an elevated ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness (SFR), one
measure of truncal obesity, is associated with increased incidence of essential hypertension.
DESIGN: Data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) were analyzed.
SUBJECTS: A cohort of 4303 women and 2579 men with complete data who were normotensive at baseline in 1971±
1975.
MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of hypertension, blood pressure 160/95 mm Hg or greater or on blood pressure medica-
tion at follow-up in 1982±1984.
RESULTS: There was a statistically signi®cant increase in risk of hypertension over approximately 10 y follow-up in
white women aged 25±74 y with SFR in the ®fth compared to the ®rst quintile independent of age and body mass
index (BMI) (relative risk  1.52, 95% con®dence interval 1.13±2.06, P  0.006). The association was somewhat
diminished after controlling for baseline blood pressure, change in BMI and other risk variables. An even stronger
association was seen for subscapular skinfold and hypertension incidence. In white men aged 25±74 y, a signi®cant
association of high SFR with age-, BMI-adjusted risk of hypertension was seen (RR  1.41, 95% CI 1.01±1.96, P  0.04).
Data for black women or black men failed to reveal signi®cant variation in hypertension risk among quintiles of SFR or
subscapular skinfold except in black women with low baseline BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from NHEFS con®rm the association of higher truncal obesity with increased incidence of
hypertension in white women. Further studies are needed, especially in larger samples of black women.

Introduction
A number of cross-sectional studies have reported
associations of increased abdominal or truncal obesity
with higher blood pressure or increased hypertension
prevalence using several indicators of body fat dis-
tribution.1±4 However such studies cannot determine
whether increased abdominal or truncal obesity pre-
ceded blood pressure elevations. Only a few studies
have attempted to examine body fat distribution as a
risk factor for incidence of hypertension.5,6 In a cohort
of white women aged 55±69 y, increased self-mea-
sured waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) increased the risk of
self-reported hypertension over a 2 y follow-up.5 In
another study, incident cases of hypertension had a
higher ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thick-
ness (SFR) than persistently normotensive controls
selected from persons undergoing repeated health
check-ups.6 In both studies, the association of central
obesity with hypertension risk was independent of
body mass index (BMI). Dif®culties in interpreting
such studies arise from the existence of competing
schemes for measurement and classi®cation of body
fat distribution and the likelihood that skinfold ratio
and WHR may not measure the same aspect of body
fat distribution. Nevertheless, it is important to use the
few available large, longitudinal data sets to better test
the hypothesis that measures of body fat distribution
are predictive of future hypertension risk.
In order to replicate these ®ndings and to examine
variation in the association by gender, race and base-
line body mass, data from a longitudinal follow-up
study of a national sample were analyzed to test the
hypotheses that persons with a ratio of subscapular to
triceps skinfolds (one measure of body fat distribu-
tion) and subscapular skinfold thickness (one measure
of absolute truncal fat mass) in the highest quintile,
were at increased risk for development of hyperten-
sion over the follow-up period compared to subjects in
the lowest quintile independent of baseline BMI.

institutionalized population aged 1±74 y of age in the
United States, excluding Alaska, Hawaii and reserva-
tion lands of American Indians.7±9 Details of the
sample design, survey procedures and response rates
have been published previously, as were the proce-
dures used to obtain informed consent and to maintain
con®dentiality of obtained information.7±9 The aged,
women of childbearing age and persons residing in
poverty areas were oversampled.
The NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up study
(NHEFS) participants were those participants in
NHANES I who were aged 25±74 y at the time of
the survey in 1971±1975 (n  14 407).10 The personal
interviews, physical and laboratory examinations of
NHANES I in 1971±1975 provided the baseline data
for the NHEFS. This analysis was based on the
follow-up, which took place during 1982±1984 and
included the determination of vital status, personal
interviews in the home with each participant or a
proxy, and collection of death certi®cates and hospital
records. At the end of the participant interview in
1982±1984, the participant's pulse rate, three conse-
cutive blood pressure readings and a weight measure-
ment were attempted by the trained interviewer.
Blood pressure was measured with the subject
seated using a sphygmomanometer of the mercury
type. An arm cuff of child, adult or large adult size
was selected according to American Heart Associa-
tion criteria.10 If a proper ®t could not be obtained,
blood pressure measurement was not performed. For
diastolic pressure the level was recorded at the level of
complete cessation of Korotkoff's sounds or, if there
was no cessation, the point of muf¯ing. Measurements
were recorded to the nearest 2 mm on the scale. Blood
pressure was measured in the right arm with the bell
of the stethoscope used for auscultation. Blood pres-
sure measurement procedures were adapted from
those of the American Heart Association and Hyper-
tension Detection and Follow-up Program.10 No phy-
sical measurements were attempted for 303 subjects
who were incapacitated or completing an interview by
telephone. Blood pressure could not be measured for
an additional 264 subjects (not attempted in 184 due
to medical contraindications or other reasons and
unsuccessful in 80).10 The failure rate was related to
age, gender and race.10 The completeness of follow-
up data collection has been reported.11 People who
became institutionalized after the baseline examina-
tion were included in NHEFS. Age, race and gender-
speci®c mortality among the NHEFS cohort has been
quite similar to that expected for the US population.12
The length of follow-up in the NHEFS for this
analysis ranged from 6.7±12.6 y, average 9.8 y for
white and 10.2 y for black survivors.
This analysis is limited to 14 235 white and black
participants aged 25±74 y at baseline (172 persons of
other races excluded). Of these subjects, 992 (7%)
were lost to follow-up and deleted from the study. To
exclude participants with hypertension at baseline,
3808 subjects were eliminated who had baseline
blood pressure 160 mm Hg systolic and/or 95 mm Hg
diastolic, or were regular or occasional users of
medication for high blood pressure at baseline. Parti-
cipants who had ever been told by a doctor that they
had high blood pressure but who had blood pressure
` 160 mm Hg systolic and 95 mm Hg diastolic and
were not users of medication for high blood pressure
were considered at risk for development of hyper-
tension. However, baseline blood pressure was con-
sidered as a possible confounder in the analysis.
Participants were excluded who had no in-person
interview, for whom blood pressure was not measured
at follow-up and who had missing baseline data on
skinfolds, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse
rate, BMI, alcohol intake, recreational physical activ-
ity, education, diabetes history, or history of medica-
tion use for blood pressure. Women pregnant at
baseline were deleted. Also excluded were partici-
pants who did not survive until the follow-up
(n  915). After all exclusions, 6157 white and 725
black subjects remained for analysis.
Hypertension criteria
Incident hypertension cases met the following criteria:
(1) a follow-up blood pressure (®rst reading)
160 mm Hg systolic and/or 95 mm Hg diastolic or (2)
a follow-up history of currently taking medication for
high blood pressure. The date of incidence was
estimated as the date of follow-up examination in
1982±1984, since interim blood pressure measure-
ments were not available.
Baseline variables
During the baseline physical examination in a mobile
examination center, trained technicians measured
skinfolds on the right side of the body using a
Lange skinfold caliper. The subscapular skinfold
was measured at the inferior angle of the scapula.
The triceps skinfold was measured posteriorly at the
halfway point between the outer edge of the acromion
process and the olecranon process of the ulna. Tech-
nicians also measured height and weight.13 The ratio
of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness (SFR) was
used as an indicator of truncal vs peripheral distribu-
tion of body fat.6 Unfortunately, neither waist nor hip
girth were measured in NHANES I. Pulse was taken at
the beginning of the examination with the pulse
counted for 30 s and multiplied by two to give the
beats/min. Next, a physician measured blood pressure
once with the examinee seated using a standard
sphygmomanometer of the mercury type or aneroid
type.14 With a few exceptions, a standard mercury
sphygmomanometer was used. A 13 cm or 9.5 cm cuff
was chosen that was at least 20% wider than the
diameter of the arm. American Heart Association
guidelines were followed. A standardized protocol
was used for all participants. A history of doctor-
diagnosed hypertension, educational attainment (y),

recreational physical activity level (much, moderate,
little or no exercise), and alcohol consumption
(drinks/d) were obtained during the household inter-
view on all persons.2±4 History of pregnancy and
current use of oral contraceptives was obtained for
women. Smoking status (cigarettes/d) was obtained at
baseline for the subsample that received the detailed
examination.7±9 For the remaining persons, smoking
status and number of cigarettes smoked at baseline
was derived from questions on the follow-up inter-
view about lifetime smoking history or imputed.15,16
The validity of this approach has been documen-
ted.15,16 Other baseline variables were measured as
described elsewhere.7±9
Statistical analysis
Estimates of the risk of hypertension for persons with
greater SFR relative to those with lower SFR derive
from Cox proportional hazards models and the SAS
procedure PHREG.17 Gender- and race-speci®c quin-
tiles of SFR and subscapular skinfold were used in
these analyses performed within gender- and race-
groups, because of the well-known gender dimorph-
ism in body fat distribution and the race differences in
body fat distribution previously reported for
NHANES I and other studies.1,3,4,13 Quintile cut-
points are shown below. Because the number of
cases limited the power of such analyses in blacks,
Cox regression analyses with SFR entered as a con-
tinuous variable with and without a SFR6BMI inter-
action term were also performed. Persons who died
and hence could not be examined at follow-up were
excluded as described above. Survivors were censored
at the date of the follow-up examination. All models
included age at baseline in single years as a covariate.
Results are also presented for whites of models which
included baseline BMI, systolic blood pressure, pulse
rate and change in BMI, as continuous variables and
smoking status here categorized as never, former, 1±
10, 11±20, b 20 cigarettes/d, educational attainment
(` 12, 12, b 12 y), alcohol consumption (` 1, 1±2,
b 2 drinks/d), diabetes history (yes, no), and recrea-
tional physical activity (much, moderate and little or
no exercise) as indicator variables. For example, the
number of cigarettes smoked was controlled for by
using four indicator variables to denote ®ve exposure
levels. Due to the small sample size and computa-
tional requirements of PHREG, models for blacks
included age, smoking , BMI, pulse rate, systolic
blood pressure and diabetes history, only. A time-
dependent covariate and inspection of -log(-log) sur-
vival curves for parallelism were used to assess
proportional hazards assumptions.17 To assess the
effect of the sample weights on the results, regression
analyses were done using sample weights and taking
the complex survey design into account using the
SUDAAN procedure.18 The results were consistent
with minimal effects of weighting on the main con-
clusions derived from the unweighted estimates,
which have smaller variances. Therefore only the
data from the unweighted Cox regression models are
presented.
Results
Table 1 shows mean values or percents for baseline
variables by level of baseline SFR for each gender and
race group. Mean systolic blood pressure, age and
BMI tended to increase with increasing SFR. Table 2
shows the number of incident cases of hypertension
by gender, race and age at baseline. Compared to
noncases, cases of hypertension detected at follow-up
tended to have higher SFR, subscapular and triceps
skinfolds, BMI, age, systolic blood pressure, and a
greater frequency of baseline history of diabetes.
Figure 1 shows higher hypertension incidence rates/
1000 person-years in subjects in the top two quintiles
of SFR than in the lowest quintile in white women
aged 25±44 y.
In white women aged 25±74 y, age- and BMI-
adjusted relative risk (RR) were signi®cantly
increased for women with SFR levels in the ®fth
quintile compared to the ®rst quintile: RR  1.52,
95% con®dence intervals (CI): 1.13, 2.06, P  0.006
(Table 3). There was a dose-response relationship
(P  0.015). After adjusting for multiple other risk
factors, RR were somewhat diminished and of border-
line signi®cance (RR  1.30, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.77,
P  0.09) (Table 3). Age-speci®c analyses indicated
the effect of SFR was greatest below age 65 (Table 3).
In women aged 25±44 y, controlling for oral contra-
ceptive use at baseline did not alter the results (not
shown).
A similar but even stronger association with hyper-
tension incidence was seen for subscapular skinfold in
white women aged 25±74 y (Figure 2, Table 4). Age-
and BMI-adjusted risk was signi®cantly elevated in
the upper two quintiles compared to the lowest quin-
tile. For the age group 25±74 y at the top quintile
compared to the ®rst quintile, the age- and BMI-
adjusted RR was 1.70, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.48. For the
age group 25±74 y, the risk-adjusted RR was of
borderline signi®cance; however for the age group
25±44 y, a greatly elevated RR persisted: RR 2.32,
95% CI: 1.17, 4.59, P  0.02.
In white men, age- and BMI-adjusted relative risks
(RR) for hypertension were increased and reached
signi®cance in the age group 25±74 y in those in the
®fth quintile compared to men in the ®rst quintile:
RR  1.41, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.96, P  0.04 (Table 3).
Table 3 also shows RR for hypertension incidence
after adjusting for multiple baseline risk variables in
addition to age and BMI. RR for hypertension
remained increased but not signi®cant for white men
aged 25±74 y with SFR in the ®fth quintile:
RR  1.40, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.96, P  0.05. In contrast
to white women aged 25±74 y, a clear, consistent

does-response relationship between SFR and inci-
dence was not apparent for white men. In white
men, the association of subscapular skinfold with
hypertension incidence did not attain statistical sig-
ni®cance after controlling for age and BMI or all risk
variables (Table 4).
In black women aged 25±74 y, age- and BMI-
adjusted hypertension risk tended to be higher with
SFR b 0.70 (upper four quintiles) compared to ` 0.71
(lowest quintile) but the difference did not attain
statistical signi®cance (not shown). Age- and BMI-
adjusted risk tended to be highest in the third and
fourth quintiles of subscapular skinfold thickness. No
signi®cant positive association was seen between SFR
or subscapular skinfold thickness and hypertension
incidence controlling for age and BMI, or age, BMI
and other risk variables in black men overall or within
age groups.
Apparent interactions of SFR with BMI were
investigated further in women. In both white women
aged 25±44 y and black women aged 25±74 y, a
signi®cant interaction of SFR and BMI was observed
in regression models with SFR and BMI entered as
continuous variables with interaction terms. To better
illustrate this effect, these regression models were
used to compute the relative risks associated with a
one standard deviation increase in SFR (0.3) for
women with BMI below and above the 50th percen-
tiles for each group: white women aged 25±44 y with
low BMI, RR  1.28 95% CI: 0.96±1.70 or with high
BMI, RR  1.35, 95% CI: 1.16±1.56 and black
women aged 25±74 y with low BMI, RR  1.40 95%
CI: 1.06±1.83 or with high BMI RR  0.96 95% CI:
0.78±1.17. The relative risks decreased with increas-
ing BMI in black women.
Discussion
This paper reports one of the ®rst demonstrations that
truncal obesity predicts the subsequent development
of hypertension even after controlling for baseline
blood pressure, thus providing evidence for a temporal
sequence consistent with a causal association. Data
from NHEFS showed a statistically signi®cant
increase of about 50% in the age- and BMI-adjusted
risk of hypertension over approximately 10 years'
follow-up in white women aged 25±74 y with SFR
in the ®fth quintile compared to women with SFR in
the ®rst quintile. The age- and BMI-adjusted RR was
even greater comparing the ®fth to the ®rst quintile of
subscapular skinfold thickness. There was an apparent
dose-response relationship of SFR with age- and BMI-
adjusted risk in white women (Table 3). Effect mod-
i®cation of SFR by BMI level was observed in
women, effects being greatest at low BMI in black

women. No signi®cant associations were seen in
blacks with the exception of black women with low
BMI.
Mechanisms have been suggested for an association
of truncal/abdominal obesity with the incidence of
essential hypertension.1,2,19,20 Elevated SFR might be
a marker for a state characterized by increased visc-
eral fat leading to insulin resistance and increased
plasma insulin levels with resulting increased sympa-
thetic nervous system activity and decreased renal
sodium excretion. These latter may produce hyperten-
sion.21±24 Previous reports have demonstrated abdom-
inal obesity to be an independent risk factor for
coronary heart disease and stroke, diseases strongly
associated with hypertension.25,26
It is likely that SFR measures a somewhat different
aspect of relative body fat distribution than other
measures such as WHR.24,27 Although likely it is
not an optimal measure, its great advantages are
long-established standardized methods and wide
availability in data sets from large population surveys.
Subscapular skinfolds measure subcutaneous truncal
fat, a somewhat different aspect of absolute truncal
body fat than measures such as waist girth, which
measures subcutaneous and intraabdominal fat, or
intraabdominal fat on computerized tomographic
scanning for visceral fat. Unlike the girth or radio-
graphic measures, skinfolds do not directly re¯ect
visceral fat. However, reported associations with
blood pressure have been similar. The ®ndings of
the present study of SFR are consistent with those
of two previous reports of fat distribution and inci-
dence of hypertension in women5 or in a multiracial
population of both genders.6 Cross-sectional positive
associations of abdominal or truncal obesity and
hypertension prevalence and blood pressure, indepen-
dent of overall obesity, have been reported in many
studies, mainly among middle-aged or younger white
subjects.1±4,24,26 Data from the National Health Exam-
ination Survey indicated a signi®cant positive associa-
tion in black women but not black men after
controlling BMI.1 In NHANES I, for subjects aged
30±59 y, the positive association of subscapular skin-
fold with blood pressure was not found to vary
signi®cantly by race.3 However, no association of
WHR with hypertension was found in elderly
blacks.28
Limitations of this study include possible bias
arising from the relatively large number of subjects
excluded because of death, loss to follow-up and
missing data at follow-up. However, such losses are
inevitable in any study of hypertension incidence in
which blood pressure measurement is used to establish
incident case status. Rate of loss to follow-up and
missing data in this study compare favorably with
other published studies.5,6 Among subjects without
hypertension at baseline and complete baseline data,
915 died before the follow-up. Since cardiovascular
deaths would be expected to be more frequent in
upper than lower quintiles of SFR,25,26 bias arising

from exclusion of these deaths would tend to be
towards the null, that is towards showning no effect
of SFR on hypertension incidence. This could partly
explain negative ®ndings in blacks.
A further source of possible bias was misclassi®ca-
tion due to assessment of hypertension at a single visit
based on a single reading. Only the ®rst follow-up
reading was used for greater comparability with base-
line data in which only a subsample had multiple
readings.7 However, the choice of de®nite hyperten-
sion as the endpoint rather than de®nite and borderline
hypertension might reduce this problem. The criteria
selected also have the advantage of allowing direct
comparison with previous studies which used these
criteria with the NHEFS data base.29 In whites, over
500 subjects reported a history of hypertension at
follow-up interview without a matching elevated
blood pressure or medication history that established
the diagnosis.29 It should also be noted that bias due to
differing measurement methods at follow-up com-
pared to baseline (that is, blood pressure measurement
in the home vs examination center; blood pressure
measured by a physician vs an interviewer) cannot be
excluded; however, it seems likely that these systema-
tic differences would not affect the estimated associa-
tion of SFR with hypertension incidence.
It was not possible to assess changes in SFR over
follow-up, however, control for change in BMI may
have reduced bias due to such changes. Nevertheless,
bias from this source cannot be excluded. Nor was it
possible to validate SFR or skinfold thickness against
radiographic or ultrasound measures of subcutaneous
or abdominal fat mass or distribution. The relatively
large number of participants taking antihypertensive
medication at follow-up limited the ability of the
study to assess an association of baseline SFR with
change in blood pressure between baseline and
follow-up. For example, among white male hyperten-
sives at follow-up, the mean change in systolic blood
pressure was only 3.4 mm Hg in subjects on blood
pressure medication compared to 27.8 mm Hg for
hypertensives not on medication.29
In order to perform survival analysis, the year of
onset was taken as the year of follow-up examination,
this approximation being necessary because of the
lack of interim examinations. A limitation of this
estimate was that subjects were likely to develop
hypertension before it was recorded in the study.
This resulted in an increase in the number of
person-years, since the subjects were surviving

longer before experiencing the hypertension event.
Consequently, the effect of hypertension was under-
stated in survival analysis. Since such errors would
likely not be related to the SFR, the effect would
likely be bias towards the null (no effect of SFR) of
the observed association of SFR and hypertension
incidence. Survival analysis using Cox regression,
still had the advantage of taking into account the
considerable variation in intervals between baseline
and follow-up examinations. Bias due to use of
survival analysis techniques is unlikely since essen-
tially the same results were obtained in whites using
logistic regression analyses, in which date of onset
and length of follow-up play no role.
The analysis of effects of survey design and use of
sample weights on regression coef®cients, described
above, generally supported the validity of using
unweighted data. Confounding by variables not mea-
sured cannot be excluded; however most important risk
factors were available with the exception of parental
history of hypertension. No convincing evidence for
nonlinear (quadratic) effects was demonstrated.
Statistical power was lower for black than for
whites because of smaller sample sizes. Because of
the small sample of blacks, examination of RR by age
and SFR quintile had low statistical power and vari-
ables with several categories had to be omitted from
the models with SFR entered as a continuous vari-
able.17 Therefore, the results for blacks must be
interpreted with caution and the analyses repeated in
studies with larger numbers.
Conclusions
Data from NHEFS con®rm the reported association of
higher SFR with a mildly increased incidence of
hypertension in white women. Reasons that this asso-
ciation was limited to white women are unknown but
may include lower statistical power in blacks, gender
and/or racial differences in the pathophysiology of
essential hypertension. Several possible mechanisms
for such an association in white women have been
suggested. More studies of this association are needed,
especially in women and blacks. Studies are needed to
clarify the relationship of subcutaneous truncal fat to
intraabdominal fat and its relative importance in the
pathogenesis of hypertension and disorders of meta-
bolism.
