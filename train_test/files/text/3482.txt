Abstract
Objective: To measure the plasma concentrations of three endogenous opioid peptides and the
levels of preproenkephalin (PPE) and preprodynorphin (PPD) mRNA in peripheral blood
lymphocytes of patients during scheduled surgery performed under intravenous general anaes-
thesia combined with an epidural block.
Methods: Patients were anaesthetized and arterial blood was collected at 0 (baseline), 20, 40, 60,
and 80 min during surgery. The plasma concentrations of b-endorphin, leucine-enkephalin and
dynorphin A were measured using radioimmunoassay. Reverse transcription­polymerase chain
reaction was used to measure the levels of PPD and PPE mRNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes
collected during surgery.
Results: Fifteen patients participated in this prospective study. The plasma concentrations of
b-endorphin were significantly lower at all time-points compared with the baseline value. The
plasma concentrations of leucine-enkephalin and dynorphin A were significantly lower at 40, 60,
and 80 min compared with baseline. The PPD/b-actin ratio was significantly lower at 80 min
compared with baseline, while the PPE/b-actin ratio showed no significant change.
Conclusion: The level of mRNA from two pre-endogenous opioid peptide genes either
decreased or remained unchanged during surgery under intravenous general anaesthesia with
epidural block, suggesting that patients remained pain free during surgery.

Introduction
It is widely recognized that endogenous
opioid peptides, expressed by pre-endogen-
ous opioid peptide genes, are associated with
pain and stress.1 These genes are expressed
in response to pain, producing pre-endogen-
ous opioid peptides (pre-EOPs) that
undergo further cleavage and post-transla-
tional modification into the endogenous
opioid peptides (EOPs).2 For example,
dynorphin is derived from preprodynorphin
(PPD), b-endorphin is derived from proo-
piomelanocortin, and enkephalin is derived
from preproenkephalin (PPE).3­9 As power-
ful analgesics, EOPs are produced in the
central neurons, suprarenal glands, spleen,
thymus gland, lungs and lymphatic
cells.10­13 In mammals, EOPs are natural
endogenous substances that perform the
same function as opioids.2 For example,
dynorphin improves the pain threshold.14­16
It has also been reported that blood EOP
concentrations increased significantly when
the human body was exposed to acute
pain;17,18 and decreased with chronic
pain.19 EOPs, which were first discovered
in the pig brain by Hughes,20 are efficient
analgesics. For example, 200 ng of enkeph-
alin injected into the rat cerebral ven-
tricle showed obvious analgesic effects.21
EOPs are also associated with learning
and memory, cardiovascular activity, repro-
duction, the endocrine system and
immunity.22,23
It is well recognized that the intense pain
associated with surgical operations can acti-
vate the pre-EOP genes that encode for the
pre-EOPs.24 In our opinion, the expression
of the pre-EOP genes may reflect the par-
ticular type of anaesthesia in use during
surgery.24 Our previous research demon-
strated that some pre-EOP genes were
highly expressed in patients undergoing
surgery with the use of intravenous and
inhalational general anaesthesia, suggesting
that these surgical patients were still exposed
to pain and stress whilst being anaesthe-
tized.24 This finding could be explained by
the fact that somatosensory pain is still
being successfully conducted to the central
nervous system. It is well known that epi-
dural anaesthesia can block the transmission
of all somatosensory pain impulses towards
the central nerve system, thus ensuring pain
relief during surgery. In order to investigate
whether patients are truly pain free under
general anaesthesia with epidural block, this
current study investigated the changes in the
plasma concentrations of three EOPs and
the mRNA levels of two pre-EOP genes in
peripheral blood lymphocytes during
surgery.
Patients and methods
Patient population
This prospective study enrolled consecutive
patients scheduled to undergo pectoral
or abdominal surgery in the Department
of Anaesthesiology, Cancer Hospital,
Shanghai Medical College, Fudan
University, Shanghai, China between
January 2007 and December 2009. All
patients were American Society of
Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classifica-
tion System 1­2.25 All patients were inter-
viewed before enrolment to ensure that they
were not experiencing any cancer pain prior
to their operation.
Ethics approval was provided by the
Ethics Committee of Fudan University
(clinical trial registration number: 0331-
2006; Cancer Hospital, Shanghai Medical
College, Fudan University) and written

informed consent was obtained from all
study participants.
Anaesthesiology methods
Following epidural acupuncture, 10 ml of
0.5% bupivicaine was injected into the
cavity. With the epidural anaesthesia at full
effect, a GrasebyTM 3500 syringe anaesthesia
pump (Smiths Medical, Ashford, UK) for
target controlled infusion (TCI) and a
HXD-I series block-type multifunctional
monitor (Huaxiang, Heilongjiang, China)
to record the bispectral index (BIS) and
mean arterial pressure (MAP) were
installed. The feedback stopping indices of
propofol TCI were set at BIS <50 and
MAP <70 mmHg. The following drugs
were injected intravenously for tracheal
intubation: 0.04­0.06 mg/kg midazolum, 3­
4 mg/ml propofol TCI, 2­3 mg/kg fentanyl
and 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium. Anaesthesia was
maintained with 1.5­2.5 mg/ml propofol
TCI. Arterial blood (4 ml) was collected
from each patient at the surgical time
points of 0 (baseline), 20, 40, 60, and
80 min, and 0.3 M disodium ethylenediami-
netetra-acetic acid (80 ml) was added to each
sample to provide anticoagulation.
Aprotinin (2000 U; Livzon Pharmaceutical
Group, Zhuhai, China) was added to the
blood samples to prevent protein degrad-
ation and the plasma was processed imme-
diately by centrifugation at 2000 g for 15 min
at 25C using an L-500 centrifuge (Shanghai
Zhaodi Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).
Peripheral blood lymphocytes were sepa-
rated from 2.5 ml arterial blood drawn at the
surgical time points of 0 and 80 min. The
sample of arterial blood was mixed with
disodium ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid
(80 ml), 5 ml of lymphocyte separating
medium (Lymphocyte Separation Medium;
Biomars, Beijing, China) and 0.9% w/v
sodium chloride (2.5 ml), then centrifuged
at 2000 g for 20 min at room temperature
using an L-500 centrifuge (Shanghai Zhaodi
Biotechnology). The purified lymphocytes
were mixed with 1 ml of TRIzolÕ reagent
(Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) to
extract total RNA following the manufac-
turers' instructions, and then the samples
were stored at À70C until further analysis.
All the patients were asked if they had
experienced any pain or sensorium during
surgery or if they did so shortly after
palinaesthesia (i.e. waking up from
anaesthesia).
Radioimmunoassay and RT­PCR analysis
The plasma concentrations of b-endorphin,
leucine-enkephalin and dynorphin A were
measured using commercially available
radioimmunoassay kits following the manu-
facturers' instructions (The Second Military
Medical University, Shanghai, China).
Reverse transcription­polymerase chain
reaction (RT­PCR) was used to measure the
levels of PPD and PPE mRNA in peripheral
blood lymphocytes. Total RNA was
extracted from peripheral blood lympho-
cytes that were separated from 2.5 ml of
arterial blood as described above and
reverse transcribed to cDNA using an RT­
PCR kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions. The
PCR primers were prepared by one of the
authors (Z.-Y.C.) in the Department of
Anaesthesiology, Cancer Hospital,
Shanghai Medical College, Fudan
University, Shanghai, China using Primer
Premier 5 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto,
CA, USA). The PCR primer sequences for
PPD were: 50-GGTCCCAAACCTATCAA
TCC-30 (sense) and 50-TGGCACCATCG
TTCAGC-30 (antisense); producing a PCR
amplification product of 627 base pairs (bp).
The PCR primer sequences for PPE were:
50-TGGCTTGCGTAATGGAAT-30 (sense)
and 50-CTCTGGGCGACCTACTCTT-30
(antisense); producing a PCR amplification
product of 529 bp. The PCR primer
sequences for the internal control b-actin
Chen et al. 767
mRNA were: 50-TGTGGCATCCACGA
AACTA-30 (sense) and 50-TCATACTCCT
GCTTGCTGATC-30 (antisense); producing
a PCR amplification product of 275 bp. The
PCR was performed in a thermal cycler
(Shanghai Naze Instrument, Shanghai,
China). The cycling programme involved
preliminary denaturation at 94C for 2 min,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at
94C for 30 s, annealing at 60C for 60 s, and
elongation at 68C for 120 s, followed by
a final elongation step at 68C for 7 min.
The PCR products were separated by
electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, stained
with ethidium bromide and the density of
the bands was calculated using an
ImageMasterTM VDS-CL system (Amer-
sham Pharmacia Biotech, Little
Chalfont, UK).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. All data are presented as
mean Æ SD. The data collected at all of the
surgical time points after 0 min were com-
pared with the baseline data at 0 min using
analysis of variance or Student's t-test. A
P-value <0.05 was considered to be statis-
tically significant.
Results
Fifteen patients (13 male and 2 female) with
a mean Æ SD age of 45.31 Æ 7.23 years
(range 38­56 years) participated in this
study. The BIS was controlled at near 50
during surgery in all patients. None of the
patients complained of pain or sensorium
during surgery or shortly after palinaesthe-
sia. The changes in the plasma concentra-
tions of b-endorphin, leucine-enkephalin
and dynorphin A during surgery are pre-
sented in Table 1. The plasma concentra-
tions of b-endorphin were significantly
lower at all time-points compared with the
baseline value at 0 min (P < 0.05 for all
comparisons). The plasma concentrations
of leucine-enkephalin and dynorphin A were
significantly lower at 40, 60, and 80 min
compared with the baseline value at 0 min
(P < 0.05 for all comparisons).
From the results of RT­PCR, the PPD/b-
actin ratio decreased significantly at 80 min
compared with the ratio at 0 min (P < 0.05),
while the PPE/b-actin ratio showed no
significant change (Table 2).
Discussion
In recent years, controlling and monitoring
the depth of general anaesthesia has become
an important area of research.26 A number

of indices, including BIS, spectral edge fre-
quency, heart rate variability and auditory
evoked potentials, have been considered as
reflecting the depth of general anaesthe-
sia.27­29 To control the depth of anaesthesia
in the current study, BIS and MAP were set
as the feedback indices for stopping the
propofol TCI. No pain or sensorium were
reported to have been experienced during
the operation and following palinaesthesia
in all patients in this current study. The
plasma concentrations of b-endorphin, leu-
cine-enkephalin and dynorphin A were
either significantly lower or showed no
significant change from the baseline values
during surgery, which explains why the
patients reported experiencing no pain or
sensorium during surgery.
In the current study, the PPD/b-actin
mRNA ratio decreased significantly at
80 min compared with the baseline ratio at
0 min, while the PPE/b-actin mRNA ratio
showed no significant change. These current
findings suggest that the expression of these
two pre-EOP genes was not increased during
surgery performed under intravenous gen-
eral anaesthesia and an epidural block.
When the current results are compared
with those of our previous research,24
which showed a higher level of expression
of pre-EOP genes in peripheral blood
lymphocytes and a significant increase in
the plasma concentrations of b-endorphin,
leucine-enkephalin and dynorphin A during
surgery performed under intravenous and
inhalational general anaesthesia, they sug-
gest that the patients in the current study
were truly pain free when operated upon
under general anaesthesia administered with
an epidural block.
The active area of general anaesthetics
runs from the peripheral nerve terminal to
the cerebral cortex, where neurons are
densely packed. The centre of the nocicep-
tive reflex arc can be the neurons in the
spinal cord or other areas of the central
nerve system containing different types of

neurons. It is well known that various types
of neurons respond differently to anaes-
thetics. When a patient undergoes intraven-
ous and inhalational general anaesthesia,
the somatosensory impulses of pain, tem-
perature and touch can still be successfully
conducted towards the cortex. Surgical pro-
cedures can produce somatosensory
impulses that stimulate the reticular forma-
tion of the central nervous system.
Therefore, the electroencephalographic indi-
ces and depth of general anaesthesia can be
unstable, as indicated by the fact that the
BIS changes markedly when the skin is cut,
which might explain why there is no one
index that perfectly reflects the depth of
general anaesthesia.24
For the patient who is operated upon
under intravenous general anaesthesia com-
bined with an epidural block, no somato-
sensory pain impulses are conducted
towards the brain during surgery because
the active area of local anaesthetics is the
spinal nerve root. As a consequence, the
electroencephalographic indices would be
stable so that the depth of anaesthesia
could be readily controlled, as demonstrated
in the current study.
This current study had a number of
limitations. First, the half-life of EOPs in
plasma is not very long because they are
short peptides, so it might be more physio-
logically correct to measure the change in
their concentrations in the cerebrospinal
fluid. Secondly, the expression of the pre-
EOP genes in the brain might better reflect
the changes in response to surgery and type
of anaesthesia. This current study was
limited to the use of peripheral blood
lymphocytes from arterial blood. Future
research will focus on the expression of
pre-EOP genes in the brain during surgery
performed using different types of anaesthe-
sia in animal models.
In conclusion, this current study demon-
strated that the plasma concentrations
of three endogenous opioid peptides,
b-endorphin, leucine-enkephalin and dynor-
phin A, in patients during scheduled pec-
toral or abdominal surgery were either
significantly lower or remained unchanged
compared with baseline. In addition, the
relative level of PPD mRNA was signifi-
cantly lower at 80 min compared with base-
line, while the relative level of PPE mRNA
showed no significant change during sur-
gery. Taken together, these findings suggest
that the patients in this current study were
truly pain free when operated upon under
general anaesthesia administered with an
epidural block.
