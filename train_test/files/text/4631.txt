Introduction
Since the function of the (pro)renin receptor (PRR) was
proposed,1 it has been considered as a new component of
the renin­angiotensin system (RAS). Prorenin, which has
been generally assumed to be an inactive precursor of renin,
can bind to its cognate receptor, inducing a conformational
change that renders it enzymatically active.1-4 Prorenin syn-
thesis can occur at adrenal tissue, eye and ovaries,5-7 and
the physiological concentration of prorenin in plasma is in
the picomolar range. For as of yet unknown reasons, the
concentration of prorenin in human plasma is higher than
that of renin8 and is 100 times higher in microalbuminuric
diabetic subjects.5,9,10 High levels of prorenin in human
plasma may indicate that the body is in a pathological con-
dition, thus prorenin could be predictive of disease. The
binding of prorenin to PRR not only increases the produc-
tion ofAngII11,12 but also activates signal transduction path-
ways that elicit fibrotic13,14 and proliferative effects15,16
independently of AngII. AngII is the key component of the
RAS and can elicit proliferative, fibrotic and proinflamma-
tory effects through a series of mechanisms that are com-
monly linked to the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). ROS play an important role in cardiovascular dis-
eases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and heart fail-
ure.17 The struggle between proliferation and apoptosis of
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which participate
in the initiation and early progression of atherosclerosis,18
was demonstrated to be mediated by AngII through ROS

Abstract
Introduction: Since the discovery of the (pro)renin receptor (PRR), it has been considered as a novel bioactive molecule
of the renin­angiotensin system (RAS). The activation of PRR can elicit a series of angiotensin II (AngII)-independent
effects.
Materials and methods: In this study, we investigated the effects of prorenin and PRR on the proliferation of human
umbilical artery smooth muscle (HUASM) cells and explored the possible mechanisms underlying these effects.
Results: The binding of prorenin to PRR can promote proliferation and upregulate the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and
downregulate the pro-apoptotic protein Bax independently of AngII in HUASM cells. In addition, the binding of prorenin
to PRR can also increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the phosphorylation of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) independently of AngII. The pretreatment of HUASM cells with an NADPH oxidase
inhibitor DPI decreased the production of ROS and also decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Furthermore,
pretreatment of HUASM cells with DPI and the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 significantly attenuated the prorenin-induced
proliferation and regulation of apoptosis factors.
Conclusion: Binding of prorenin to PRR can induce HUASM cell proliferation via the ROS generation and ERK1/2
activation.

production, which depends on the activation of NAD(P)H
oxidase.19-23 However, whether prorenin could induce
apoptosis in human umbilical artery smooth muscle
(HUASM) cells has not been reported, and whether and
how prorenin and PRR affect the production of ROS in
HUASM cells remain unknown.
In this study, we hypothesized that the binding of
prorenin to PRR can promote proliferation and inhibit
apoptosis, and we investigated the role of ROS in the
prorenin-induced effects on HUASM cells. To evaluate the
PRR-mediated, AngII-independent effects of prorenin, we
used Valsartan (Ang II type 1 receptor blocker) and
PD123319 (Ang II type 2 receptor blocker) and PRR-
targeted siRNA.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Prorenin was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company
(Michigan, USA). PD123319 and DPI were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). Valsartan
was obtained from Beijing Novartis Company (Beijing,
China). The ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was purchased
from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). PRR siRNA and transfec-
tion reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (California,
USA).
Cell culture
Human umbilical cords were collected from healthy preg-
nant women at The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian
Medical University. The pregnant women gave written
informed consent prior to delivery. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated
Hospital of Dalian Medical University.
Under sterile conditions, umbilical arteries were iso-
lated from human umbilical cords. The arteries were dis-
sected longitudinally, and the intimas of the arteries were
scraped with scissors to remove the endothelium. Next,
the arteries were cut into small pieces of tissue (1×1×1
mm). The tissue samples were placed in 35 mm culture
plates and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2
. After 2 h, 3 ml
of Medium 231 (Gibco, California, USA) supplemented
with Smooth Muscle Growth Supplement (SMGS, Gibco,
California, USA) and 1× strength antibiotics/antimycotic
(HyClone, Logan City, Utah, USA) was gently trans-
ferred into the culture plates. The media were refreshed
every 3 days.
Cells began growing from the explants within 1 week
and became confluent in approximately 3­4 weeks. The
HUASM cells were cultured in Medium 231 with SMGS
for trypsinization, passage, or freezing, according to stand-
ard protocols. We used second-to-fourth passage HUASM
cells in our experiments.
Specific siRNA and transfection
The cDNA sequence of the PRR gene was obtained from
GenBank (NM_005765.2), and the targeting sequences of
the siRNAs were designed and chemically synthesized by
Invitrogen (California, USA). The nucleotide sequences
were as follows: 5'-GCUCCGUAAUCGCCUGUUU -3'
(sense), and 5'-AAACAGGCGAUUACGGAGC -3'(anti-
sense). As a negative control, a non-targeting scrambled
siRNA (control siRNA) was also purchased. Cells were
plated in 6-well plates, and the siRNAs were transfected
into the cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent
(Invitrogen, California, USA) according to the manufac-
turer's protocols.
Immunofluorescence
HUASM cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 5000
cells per well and grown in Medium 231 supplemented
with SMGS for 1­2 days. The cells were rinsed with phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde (30 min, 4°C), washed three times with PBS, and
permeabilized for 20 min with 0.3% Triton-X100. The
cells were washed with PBS and then incubated at room
temperature for 1 h in PBS with 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Labeling experiments were performed with a
mouse anti-human antibody against -smooth muscle actin
(1:100, BOSTER, Wuhan, China) or PRR (1:100, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). Fluorescein-conjugated AffiniPure goat
anti-mouse IgG antibodies (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) or
Rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-
rabbit IgG antibodies (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) diluted
1:100 in PBS (1 h, room temperature) were used for visu-
alization. Hoechst 33258 (37°C, 5 min) was used to stain
the cell nuclei. The cells were rinsed and assessed by fluo-
rescence microscopy.
Measurement of cell proliferation
The proliferation of HUASM cells was measured using a
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Beyotime, Shanghai,
China), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly,
the HUASM cells were cultured in triplicate at 2×103 cells/
well in 96-well plates. After different treatments, 10 l of
CCK-8 reagent was added to each well. After 1 h of incu-
bation at 37°C, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured
using a microplate reader. The relative levels of cell prolif-
eration for each group were normalized to the levels of the
control group, which represented 100%.
ROS measurement
ROS production was measured using a Reactive Oxygen
Species Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Briefly,
1×106 HUASM cells seeded into 6-well plates were treated
Liu et al. 101
with prorenin for 24 h.At the end of the treatment period, the
cells were washed once with PBS and then incubated with
DCFH-DA(5 M) in medium for 20 min at 37°C in the dark.
Next, the cells were washed with PBS three times, trypsi-
nized, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
The fluorescence intensity of the cells was measured at 488
nm using a flow cytometer (BD FACS AriaII, USA).
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol rea-
gent (Invitrogen, California, USA) according to the manu-
facturer's protocols. cDNA was synthesized from total
RNA using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China). mRNAexpression levels were evaluated by
real-time PCR using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics)
and SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The
amplification reactions were performed in a total volume of
20 l and cycled 40 times after initial denaturation (95°C
for 30 s) with the following parameters: 95°C for 5 s and
60°C for 20 s. GAPDH was used as the internal control. All
of the primers were designed by TaKaRa (Table 1).
Western blot
Cellular proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 2 mg/ml aprotinin and 1 mM
PMSF) for 30 min at 4°C. The extracts were centrifuged at
12,000×g for 15 min at 4°C. Then, supernatants containing
the total cellular protein were harvested. The protein con-
centrations were quantified using the BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Keygen, Nanjing, China). The total protein extracts
(30 g) were electrophoretically separated using 10% SDS-
polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically
onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45 m pore
size). The blots were blocked for 60 min at room tempera-
ture with 5% skimmed milk in PBS with Tween-20.
Immunoblotting was performed using anti-phospho-ERK
1/2, anti-ERK 1/2 (Bioworld Technology, Minneapolis,
USA, dilution 1:750), anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz, California,
USA, dilution 1:200), anti-Bax (Santa Cruz, California,
USA, dilution 1:500) and anti-PRR (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK, dilution 1:700) antibodies overnight at 4°C. After
three washes with PBST at 10 min, the membrane was
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second-
ary antibodies (dilution 1:1500, ZHONGSHAN, Beijing,
China) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were visual-
ized using ECL Plus according to the manufacturer's proto-
cols. Blotting with an anti--actin (dilution 1:1000, Bioss,
Beijing, China) antibody served as an internal control.
Statistical analysis
The data were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) using SPSS 16.0 software, and the least signifi-
cant difference (LSD) test or the Dunnett T3 test were used
for post-hoc subgroup analysis. All of the data are
expressed as the mean values ± SD of three independent
experiments. The data were considered statistically signifi-
cant when p < 0.05.
Results
Verification of vascular smooth muscle cells and
the location PRR in HUASM cells
We observed HUASM cells that appeared fusiform or
polygonal in shape by light microscopy (Figure 1(a)).
Because smooth muscle cells express the smooth muscle
myofilament protein -smooth muscle actin (SMA), we
evaluated -SMA(Figure 1(b­d)) by fluorescence immuno-
histochemistry and observed the uniform and filamentous
expression of -SMA in the HUASM cells. We also deter-
mined the distribution of PRR in HUASM cells by fluores-
cence immunohistochemistry and detected the cytoplasmic
expression of PRR (Figure 1(e­g)). We can see that the red
fluorescence represents the PRR expression, and find that
around the cell nucleus the PRR expression was higher.
Effect of prorenin on proliferation in HUASM
cells
Cell proliferation was assayed using a CCK-8 assay. We
treated HUASM cells with 0.1, 1 and 10 nM prorenin for

24 h in the presence of Valsartan and PD123319 and found
that 10 nM prorenin most significantly induced the prolif-
eration of HUASM cells independently of AngII (Figure
2(a)). Next, we observed the effect of prorenin on prolif-
eration at different time points and found that with increas-
ing time, the proliferative effect became more significant
(Figure 2(b)).
We next determined whether prorenin could affect the
expression of apoptosis-related factors.As shown in Figure
2, both protein and mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
and pro-apoptotic Bax were upregulated and downregu-
lated, respectively, in the 10 nM group compared with
none and con group. These results indicated that prorenin
can regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in HUASM
cells.
Downregulation of PRR inhibits the prorenin-
induced proliferation of HUASM cells
To determine whether the effects of prorenin are medi-
ated by the PRR in HUASM cells, HUASM cells were
transfected with PPR-targeting siRNA. At 72 hours after
transfection, the levels of PRR mRNA were the most sig-
nificantly reduced by 82% (Figure 3(a)), and the PRR
protein was reduced to barely detectable levels (Figure
3(b)).
Transfection with a PRR siRNA significantly decreased
the effects that prorenin (10 nM at 24 h) elicited on the
proliferation of HUASM cells (Figure 4(a)). The expres-
sion of Bcl-2 and Bax were also affected by PRR.As shown
in Figure 4, the upregulated expression of Bcl-2 and the
downregulated expression of Bax were altered, at both the
protein and mRNA levels, after transfection with the PRR
siRNA. These results indicated that the prorenin-induced
effects in HUASM cells were mediated by PRR.
Prorenin promotes the production of ROS in
HUASM cells
Although prorenin can promote the proliferation of
HUASM cells, the underlying mechanism remains unclear.
Thus, we first examined whether prorenin elicits an effect
on the production of ROS in HUASM cells. We found that
prorenin increases the production of ROS in a concentra-
tion-dependent manner and that the treatment with the
nitric oxide synthase inhibitor DPI could inhibit this ROS
production (Figure 5(a)). Transfection with a PRR siRNA
significantly reduced the effects of prorenin (10 nM at 24
h) on the production of ROS (Figure 5(b)). These data
indicated that prorenin can induce the production of ROS
through PRR.
Effect of prorenin on ERK1/2 phosphorylation
Prorenin significantly increased the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 independently of AngII, with peaks at 15 min and
30 min compared with the control (Figure 5(c)).
Furthermore, pretreatment with DPI (10 M) decreased
the prorenin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 to a
level that was similar to that observed with PD98059

(25 M) (Figure 5(d)). These results indicated that ROS
are involved in prorenin-induced phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 in HUASM cells.
Prorenin promotes proliferation via the
production of ROS and the activation of the
ERK1/2 pathways
Prorenin can induce the production of ROS and the phos-
phorylation of ERK1/2 in HUASM cells, but whether ROS
and ERK1/2 are required for prorenin-induced prolifera-
tion is unknown. As shown in Figure 6, pretreatment with
DPI and PD98059 significantly inhibited the production of
ROS, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the proliferative
effects of prorenin on HUASM cells. Moreover, the pre-
treatment also altered the prorenin-induced upregulated
expression of Bcl-2 and the downregulated expression of
Bax at both the protein and mRNA levels.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that prorenin can promote
the proliferation of HUASM cells and upregulate the
expression of Bcl-2 and downregulate the expression of
Bax through PRR independently of AngII. We also found
that ROS and ERK1/2 are involved in these prorenin-
induced effects.

First, we confirmed the expression of PRR in HUASM
cells, consistent with previous studies.1,13,24 The functional
PRR was first proposed by Nguyen et al.,1 who demon-
strated that PRR is present in several organs, including the
heart, brain, placenta, kidney and the liver. The role of
PRR has been investigated in many cell and tissue types.
The activation of PRR promotes the expression of fibrosis-
related genes in HEK cells14 and VSMCs,13,16 and induces
oxidative stress in neuronal cells.25 In animal models, PRR
has been shown to be involved in the regulation of myo-
cardial fibrosis and the deterioration of cardiac function.26
In diabetic rats, the expression of PRR is upregulated27 and
contributes to the development of glomerulosclerosis,28,29
diabetic nephropathy,30 and elevated blood pressure and
heart rate.31 Extensive evidence has shown that PRR is
associated with cardiovascular disease.32
Prorenin, which is considered as an inactive renin pre-
cursor, can bind to PRR within the nanomolar range1,2,33
and trigger a series of molecular events. The binding of
prorenin to PRR might not only promote the production of
AngII but also might play a role similar to, but indepen-
dently of, AngII. In this study, we demonstrated that
prorenin can promote the proliferation of HUASM cells
through PRR independently of AngII and can further regu-
late the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. Proliferation and
apoptosis are imbalanced processes during the early pro-
gression of atherosclerosis.
VSMCs have two types of phenotype: synthetic
phenotype and contractile phenotype. VSMCs undergo a
phenotypic change from contractile phenotype to syn-
thetic phenotype in response to external stimulation such
as growth factors and shear stress.34 This transformation
directly causes abnormal proliferation and migration of
VSMCs from the medial layer to the intimal layer, and
VSMCs can synthesize extracellular matrix which is
responsible for formation of atherosclerotic plaque.18
Phenotype modulation of VSMCs contributes to the
remodeling of vessels, which further leads to the occur-
rence of cardiovascular diseases. Apoptosis occurs at dif-
ferent stages of atherosclerosis. In the early progression of
atherosclerosis, phenotype-transformed VSMCs may
express adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhe-
sion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1
like endothelial cells, and these adhesion molecules could
promote VSMC proliferation and also prevent apoptosis
of these cells.18 The Bcl-2 family proteins are important
regulators of cellular apoptosis pathways, and Bcl-2 is an
anti-apoptotic protein, whereas Bax is a pro-apoptotic
protein.35 These proteins contribute to the balance between
proliferation and apoptosis.36 Our study showed that
Figure 4. Downregulation of PRR inhibits the prorenin-induced proliferation of HUASM cells.
HUASM cells were transfected with control (open bars) or PPR (filled bars)-targeted siRNAs. Then, the cells were exposed to prorenin (10 nM) for

prorenin can regulate the expression of apoptosis proteins
through PRR independently of AngII in HUASM cells,
and this anti-apoptotic effect may contribute to the forma-
tion of early atherosclerosis.
ROS are known to participate in the development of
many cardiovascular diseases.37 In VSMCs, various stim-
uli can induce the production of ROS, which might induce
further proliferation,38 increase inflammatory gene expres-
sion39 and modulate matrix remodeling.40 In endothelial
cells, ROS can regulate the expression of adhesion mole-
cules, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and
intracellular adhesion molecule-1.41 The production of
ROS, which can represent a second messenger, can trigger
a series of downstream signal transduction pathways, such
as those mediated by Akt22 or ERK1/2.42,43 A weakened
antioxidative defense system and oxidative stress can con-
tribute to the dysfunction of vascular cells, increasing the
relative inflammatory gene expression.44 Based on the
effect of ROS on VSMCs and endothelial cells, ROS can
participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Our
study showed that prorenin can promote the production of
ROS through PRR independently of AngII. In HEK14 and
neuronal25 cells, ROS are also involved in prorenin-
induced effects through PRR. In addition, the expression
of PRR is regulated by ROS in diabetic rats.27 In previous
studies, the prorenin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2
has been shown in VSMCs.15,16,45 Our study further con-
firmed that the prorenin-induced phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 is mediated by ROS production, and that the inhi-
bition of ROS production reduced the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2. Early studies have also reported that ROS can
mediate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to AngII.46
A recent study claimed that in neuronal cells, the produc-
tion of ROS through PRR is regulated by ERK1/2 and
PI3K/Akt.25 There may be a crosstalk between ROS pro-
duction and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which
remains to be elucidated. Overall, ROS and ERK1/2 play
pivotal roles in terms of prorenin-induced effects.
The RAS plays a key role in cardiovascular and renal
diseases, and the blockade of the RAS is considered to be
beneficial and to reduce cardiovascular risks, despite the
fact that its inhibition cannot completely inhibit the

development of these diseases. The answer to this question
might reside in the AngII-independent effects induced by
the binding of prorenin with PRR. Ichihara et al.47 devel-
oped a decoy-epitope peptide of the prorenin prosegment,
which is called the `handle-region peptide'(HRP) and
which can block the binding of prorenin to the PRR. In in
vivo studies, the subcutaneous administration of HRP sig-
nificantly attenuated renal and cardiac damage.48,49
However, certain studies have failed to find any effects
elicited by HPR in this regard.50,51 Although discrepancies
remain regarding HRP, PRR is clearly a key component of
the RAS, in addition toAngII, and PRR represents a poten-
tial pharmacological target.
In conclusion, our study has shown that prorenin can
promote the proliferation of HUASM cells, upregulate the
expression of Bcl-2 and downregulate the expression of
Bax through PRR independently of AngII. Moreover, we
demonstrated that ROS and ERK1/2 are involved in
prorenin-induced effects.
