Article
In 2007, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) initi-
ated an intensive effort aimed at reducing suicidal behavior
among Veteran populations (Kemp, 2014). At present, the
number of Veterans who die by suicide is estimated at 18 to
22 per day, accounting for approximately 18% of all suicide
completions in the United States (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2014; Kemp & Bossarte, 2013). These high
rates are thought to be due, at least in part, to the increased
incidence of diagnosed mental health disorders in this group
(LeardMann et al., 2013). Be that as it may, suicide is much
more than just a mental health issue (Department of Health
and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, &
National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, 2012).
Research finds that more than 50% of those who die by sui-
cide do not have a psychiatric diagnosis (Bertolote &
Fleischmann, 2002). This highlights the need for novel sup-
port options, not limited only to formal mental health ser-
vices, which can be accessed by at-risk populations.
All VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) staff clinical chaplains
who provide spiritual and pastoral care services when
requested by the Veteran. Pastoral care is sometimes defined
as "a therapeutic modality distinguished by the dialogue of
caregiver and careseeker that explores the possibility and
implications of a religious definition of the latter's situation"
(Furniss, 1994, p. 177). Spiritual care relates to "an apprecia-
tion of presence and purpose that includes a sense of
meaning" and is inclusive of pastoral care (VandeCreek &
Burton, 2001, p. 2). Most chaplains also provide a number of
services not directly affiliated with any faith tradition, such
as crisis intervention, emotional enabling, ethical consulta-
tion, deliberation, life review, patient advocacy, counseling,
bereavement, and empathetic listening (Handzo et al., 2008).
Unlike some community-level clergy or pastoral care pro-
viders, clinical chaplains are specially trained to support
patients in health care settings.
VA chaplains have assumed a unique place within the
structure of services provided at VAMCs. As a matter of pol-
icy, the comprehensive health care package offered to
Veterans is expected to include spiritual and pastoral care
(i.e., when so requested by the patient; Department of
Veterans Affairs, 2008a). Many Veterans will look to

Abstract
In recent years, identifying ways to mitigate the risk of suicidal behavior in Veteran populations has become a major public
health challenge of special significance. This has included identifying support options that can be used by Veterans in times
of distress or crisis. For example, Veterans at increased risk of suicide will sometimes voice complaints indicative of a need
for spiritual and pastoral care support. At U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, such support is provided to
Veterans by clinical chaplains. This discussion paper aims to present the contextual framework in which chaplaincy services
are provided to Veterans at increased risk of suicide, better conceptualize the spiritual and pastoral care needs of at-risk
Veterans who request chaplaincy services, and offer practical suggestions for framing the provision of spiritual and pastoral
care services.

chaplains for support in times of distress (Besterman-Dahan,
Gibbons, Barnett, & Hickling, 2012; Bonner et al., 2013;
Iversen et al., 2010; Kirchner, Farmer, Shue, Blevins, &
Sullivan, 2011; Kopacz & Karras, 2014; Sullivan, 2007).
Considering the broad cross-section of patients who seek
health care through VAMCs, most chaplains can also be
expected to have contact with Veterans considered to be at
increased risk of suicide (Kopacz, 2013). VA chaplains who
report such contact estimate that at-risk Veterans account for
upward of 10% of their total patient population (Kopacz,
McCarten, & Pollitt, in press).
Recent findings in prevalence, risk factor, and interven-
tion studies suggest that Veteran populations exhibit unique
health care needs and practices, including unique spiritual
and pastoral care needs among at-risk populations (Kopacz,
2013; Rice & Sher, 2012). Yet, examining how to most effec-
tively meet the spiritual and pastoral care needs of at-risk
Veterans is without precedent in the literature. Furthermore,
a paucity of literature exists describing the potential applica-
bility of chaplaincy services to at-risk Veteran populations.
This discussion paper aims to present the contextual frame-
work in which chaplaincy services are provided to Veterans
at increased risk of suicide, better conceptualize the spiritual
and pastoral care needs of at-risk Veterans who request chap-
laincy services, and offer practical suggestions for framing
the provision of spiritual and pastoral care services.
As the largest integrated health care system in the United
States (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2013b), VA pro-
grams reach Veteran populations recognized as being at
increased risk of suicide (Blow et al., 2012; McCarthy et al.,
2009). The experiences of VA chaplains included in this arti-
cle are meant to offer a degree of practical insight into at-risk
Veteran spiritual and pastoral care needs, which may also
serve to better inform the provision of such services in other
clinical and community settings.
A Contextual Framework for
Chaplaincy Services
Available literature and anecdotal evidence suggest that
many Veterans ascribe a degree of importance to religion and
spirituality (Chang et al., 2012; Goertz et al., 2013; House
Committee on Veterans' Affairs, 2012; LaPierre, 1994; Pew
Social and Demographic Trends, 2011). While "religion"
and "spirituality" are frequently used interchangeably, these
terms actually represent two distinct domains. Religion
refers to "the outwards and often social articulation of belief
in higher powers, often practiced in a community setting" (p.
345) and spirituality is thought to refer to "an individual's
quest for understanding the true meaning of life and the
desire to integrate with the transcendent or sacred" (Jonas,
2005, p. 380). A sense of well-being in either domain implies
having achieved "a positive outcome that is meaningful for
people and for many sectors of society" (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2013).
Achieving a sense of religious and/or spiritual well-being
is of practical significance to suicide prevention efforts as
these domains are thought to cut across the various behav-
ioral, physical, psychological, and social factors which might
lead one to suicidal behavior (Brown, Carney, Parrish, &
Klem, 2013; Koenig, King, & Carson, 2012). Such well-
being is considered protective against suicidal behavior (The
Assessment and Management of Risk for Suicide Working
Group, 2013; Department of Health and Human Services
et al., 2012; Simon, 2011; World Health Organization, 2012).
Available research suggests that some at-risk Veteran popu-
lations have a diminished sense of self-reported spiritual
well-being (Kopacz, 2014), highlighting the relevance of
these domains to Veteran suicide prevention efforts.
VA chaplaincy services draw on the principles of
meaning-making and look to enhance religious and/or spiri-
tual well-being by developing a sense of meaning and pur-
pose in the lives of Veterans (Department of VeteransAffairs,
2008a). VA chaplaincy services are meant to uncover mean-
ing and purpose in one's relationships with self, others, ideas,
nature, and, when relevant for the Veteran, with a higher
power, benevolent deity, or God. This is done by examining
one's relationships in the context of their spiritual and/or reli-
gious values. Meaning and purpose are considered vital for
ensuring a variety of positive physical and psychological
health outcomes (Schulenberg, Hutzell, Nassif, & Rogina,
2008; Stillman et al., 2009; Reker, Peacock, & Wong, 1987).
As suggested by Frankl (1984), "If therapists wish to foster
their patients' mental health, they should not be afraid to cre-
ate a sound amount of tension through a reorientation toward
the meaning of one's life" (p. 128).
Chaplains focus on relationships because they are thought
to form an intra-, inter-, and trans-relational web that houses
a person's sense of meaning and purpose (Snyder, Lopez, &
Pedrotti, 2011). A degree of distress, inclusive of spiritual
distress, may arise when one or more of these relationships
are threatened or broken. Table 1 presents examples of what
many chaplains understand to be indicative of spiritual dis-
tress. The more significant a particular relationship is, the
greater the spiritual distress. Spiritual wholeness is restored
when that which threatens or breaks the patient's relational
web of meaning is removed, transformed, integrated, or
transcended.
Veteran Spiritual Needs
VA chaplains will oftentimes provide care to at-risk Veterans
dealing with spiritual or moral injury arising from past mili-
tary experiences as well as a variety of life circumstances not
necessarily related to military service. These circumstances
challenge the Veteran's existing relationships, forcing him or
her to redefine their existing sense of meaning and purpose.
Just as the process of human development affords stages of
growth, so too does spiritual development afford the oppor-
tunity for living a life of integrity in which life experiences
Kopacz et al. 3
reflect a deepening of one's spiritual development. It is
expected that one's adulthood experiences will instill change
and transformation within one's spiritual journey. The pro-
cess of transformation reflects these experiences, experi-
ences that are not childhood experiences but, rather, those of
an adult. VA chaplains support the Veteran in his or her own
search for meaning as well as determination of what these
experiences may have contributed to their spiritual journey.
Advances in the organization and delivery of battlefield
health care mean that many service personnel are surviving
trauma, which would have otherwise proven fatal in combat
theaters from earlier eras (Beekley, 2006; Gawande, 2004;
Manring, Hawk, Calhoun, & Andersen, 2009). While bodily
wounds may heal, this has led to an increase in the number of
Veterans dealing with otherwise "invisible wounds."
Individuals with a history of military service in times of war
frequently suffer from psychological distress at varying
degrees of severity (Gray, Kaiser, Hawksworth, Hall, &
Barrett-Connor, 1999). The diagnostic status of Veterans
who served following September 11, 2001, may also be sig-
nificantly influenced by trauma exposure outside of warzone
traumatic stress (Dedert et al., 2009; Hankin, Spiro, Miller,
& Kazis, 1999). The VA expects that the number of Veterans
requiring mental health services will continue to increase in
the coming years (Department of Veterans Affairs, 2013a).
The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan differ from those of
past wars, among others, based on the all-volunteer force as
well as the types of warfare conducted in these regions (Hoge
et al., 2004). The unique nature of these conflicts--reflective
of theater-specific duties and experiences--could influence
symptom presentation and treatment (Tuerk, Grubaugh,
Hamner, & Foa, 2009). Besides experiencing situations
which may pose a threat to the life of the service member or
those close to them, the experience of active duty may also
include witnessing violence, experiencing a painful loss, or
having one's ethical or moral standards contravened (Nash
et al., 2013; Stein et al., 2012).
This has given way to the idea of spiritual or moral injury
in Veteran populations, conceptually defined as "perpetrating,
failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about acts
that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations"
(Litz et al., 2009, p. 700). Moral injury is representative of the
challenge of having to reconcile certain wartime experiences
with individual interpretations of right and wrong and is pur-
ported to increase the risk of suicide in some Veteran popula-
tions (Kohlberg, 1973; Litz et al., 2009; Maguen et al., 2012).
Interpretations of right and wrong may draw on individual
experiences related to religion and/or spirituality. In attempt-
ing to deal with different types of trauma, some Veterans
might turn to spiritual and pastoral care for support
(Greenawalt et al., 2011; Mihaljevi, Aukst-Margeti,
Vuksan-usa, Koi, & Milosevi, 2012).
Chaplains frequently also encounter at-risk Veterans deal-
ing with a variety of life events (e.g., divorce, illness, rela-
tionships), not necessarily related to military service. In
keeping with pastoral practice, VAchaplains help the Veteran
uncover a religious and/or spiritual definition in the difficult
circumstances they may be experiencing. In doing so, the
aim is to elicit an enhanced sense of meaning and purpose in
the life of the Veteran which can be used to better deal with
turbulent emotions (e.g., loss and grief, hope and despair, joy
and sadness) arising in the course of these life events as well
as help reaffirm the Veteran's understanding of self/
personhood.
Emotions frequently encountered in these life circum-
stances include guilt, sadness, and grief (Berg, 2011; Owens,
Steger, Whitesell, & Herrera, 2009; Urlic & Simunkovic,
2009). Guilt is conceptualized as a sense of remorse, regret,
or self-condemnation, most often linked to a concrete event
(Bryan, Ray-Sannerud, Morrow, & Etienne, 2013; Henning
& Frueh, 1997; Marx et al., 2010). In Veteran populations,
thoughts of self-harm (i.e., suicide ideation) may serve as an
expression of remorse for past actions (Bryan, Morrow,
Etienne,&Ray-Sannerud,2013;Singer,2004).Conceptually,
crisis situations may arise if a Veteran is unable to express his
or her guilt in a healthy manner or if he or she rejects social
support, leading to feelings of helplessness and isolation
(Singer, 2004; Wellen, 2010).
Sadness and grief are emotional reactions to loss that are
typically time-limited (Wellen, 2010). For some Veterans,
grief-specific symptoms are distinct from symptoms related
to war trauma (Pivar & Field, 2004). Nevertheless, if not
dealt with in a manner appropriate for the individual, grief
can become pathological or chronic, adding to one's emo-
tional burden (Aloi, 2011; Gort, 1984). To date, however,
only a small body of literature has directly examined the
relationship between Veteran experiences of grief and differ-
ent health outcomes.
The Spiritual Dimension of Suicide
Religion and suicide have been inextricably linked ever since
Durkheim's (1897/1997) seminal study. Consequently, most
clinicians see religion and spirituality as important to under-
standing suicidal behavior (Colucci & Martin, 2008). While
an extensive literature exists expounding on the many

biological, social, and environmental factors increasing
one's risk of suicide, a paucity of empirical literature exists
describing the religious and/or spiritual risk factors for sui-
cide (Sanchez, 2007). Religion and spirituality serve as
examples of "common, culturally generated personal traits,
social relationships, lifestyles, representations of illness and
treatments, and/or approaches to planning for prevention and
management of illness and illness risks" (Leventhal,
Weinman, Leventhal, & Phillips, 2008, p. 492). As such, bet-
ter understanding the relationship between religion, spiritu-
ality, and suicidal behavior should remain a focus of future
research.
Engel (1977) proposed a biopsychosocial model of med-
icine to serve as a conceptual basis for applying the scien-
tific method to better understand health and illness. This
model posits that health and illness are dependent upon an
interaction between biological, psychological, and social
systems (Engel, 1980). Spirituality is thought to fall under
the social domain of this model (Smith, 2002). Accordingly,
an enhanced sense of religious and/or spiritual well-being
may exact health benefits across all three of these systems
(Schaefer et al., 2013). For example, individuals who
ascribe a high degree of importance to religion and spiritu-
ality may be more resilient against depression due to ana-
tomical changes in their central nervous system (Miller
et al., 2014). Meaning and purpose have also consistently
been cited as influencing psychological well-being (Blaek,
Kamierczak, & Besta, 2014; Schütte et al., 2014). Finally,
positive social relationships, such as those leading to higher
social support, less loneliness, and less conflict, can be
built by applying interpersonal constructs frequently asso-
ciated with spiritual and religious tenets, such as gratitude
and compassion (Jordan, Masters, Hooker, Ruiz, & Smith,
2014).
Chaplaincy Services Applied
Frankl (1984) suggests uncovering meaning and purpose
"(1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing
something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude
we take toward unavoidable suffering" (p. 133). In the
same vein, VA chaplains are able to offer spiritual and pas-
toral care services aimed at uncovering meaning and pur-
pose in the life of the at-risk Veteran. All such services are
provided on a strictly voluntary basis (i.e., based entirely on
the private choice of the patient; Department of Veterans
Affairs, 2008b). The work done by chaplains typically
involves first meeting with the Veteran, assessing their reli-
gious and/or spiritual needs, and proposing a pastoral care
plan that can be adapted based on the Veteran's changing
needs. VA chaplaincy services do not include a religious
component unless expressly requested by the patient
(Department of Veterans Affairs, 2008b). Patients are at lib-
erty to discontinue any or all services, at any time, and for
any reason.
Ministry of Presence
The Ministry of Presence serves to facilitate spiritual heal-
ing. "Ministry of presence in the pastoral office means vul-
nerability to and participation in the life-world of those
served" (Hunter, 1990, p. 950). In simple terms, it describes
the physical presence of a chaplain and their willingness to
meet without preconditions (W. F. Sullivan, 2014). The pri-
mary goal of the Ministry of Presence is to reestablish a
sense of trust, safety, and consistency for the at-risk Veteran.
Chaplains frequently see those who experience spiritual dis-
tress as also losing a sense of hope in establishing meaning-
ful relationships. Having felt abandon, such Veterans may
also have issues with trust and safety. Ministry of Presence is
meant to establish rapport with the individual, leading to a
relationship based on consistency. In the context of clinical
chaplaincy, this involves following the patient's treatment
agenda and, when appropriate, being pro-active in his or her
provision of spiritual care (e.g., offering support after hear-
ing a diagnosis; being consistent and following through with
promises made; Fontana & Rosenheck, 2004, 2005; Hughes
& Handzo, 2010; Shaw, Joseph, & Linley, 2005).
Trauma Recovery
The search for meaning motivates many Veterans to look for
support from pastoral care providers and VA mental health
professionals (Fontana & Rosenheck, 2005; Hughes &
Handzo, 2010). Those presenting for VA chaplaincy services
will oftentimes look for the restoration of meaning specifi-
cally related to their trauma, which may "refer both to the
negative events that produce distress and to the distress
itself" (Briere & Scott, 2006, p. 3). VA chaplains frequently
help Veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) or those dealing with different types of trauma. A
diagnosis of PTSD has been significantly associated with
suicidal behavior (Sareen, Houlahan, Cox, & Asmundson,
2005).
Hughes and Handzo (2010) suggest,
as the person with PTSD is seeking to reframe his or her
assumptions that were held prior to the trauma to accommodate
the experience of that trauma, so grief is about redefining one's
understanding of the world, oneself, and others. (p. 56)
Chaplains assist individuals with PTSD to work through
their grief by identifying specific losses, providing a safe
place to grieve, providing grief education to normalize emo-
tional responses, and identifying coping strategies (Hughes
& Handzo, 2010). Fontana and Rosenheck (2005) conclude
that greater consideration should be given to addressing exis-
tential questions in the treatment of PTSD, stating "that reso-
lution of existential questions requires an examination of the
bases for moral judgments" (p. 135). VA chaplains help facil-
itate an examination of morality in the context of the
Veteran's own religious and/or spiritual background.
Kopacz et al. 5
Hughes and Handzo (2010) also propose eight specific
spiritual care interventions for those dealing with PTSD:
clinical use of prayer, healing rituals, confession (i.e., as a
means for guilt resolution and forgiveness-work), percentage
of guilt distribution, life review/spiritual autobiography
work, scripture paralleling/education, reframing God
assumptions/examining harmful spiritual attributions, and
encouraging connection with a spiritual community. Prayer
has been widely utilized as a coping strategy in clinical set-
tings (R. M. Brown & Niebuhr, 1987; Foster, 1992). Healing
rituals can also help one find a renewed sense of meaning
(Fontana & Rosenheck, 2005; Hughes & Handzo, 2010).
Confession helps with the release of feelings of guilt and
refocuses the individual on healing through the seeking and
giving of forgiveness and pardon (Drescher, Smith, & Foy,
2007; Grossman, 1996). Discussing the percentage of guilt
distribution helps one reappraise and reframe his or her feel-
ings of guilt by differentiating appropriate from inappropri-
ate guilt. This facilitates a greater ease in dealing with and
ultimately resolving guilt (Scurfield, 2006).
Life Review
Life review is defined as "the process of facilitation of the
life review experience or mental process of reviewing one's
life" (Butler, 1963, p. 66). Life review enables one to narrate
his or her spiritual autobiography. In doing so, one can redis-
cover insights, strengths, themes, and so on, and possibly
find resonance with his or her current situation following
traumatic stress (Fowler, 1995, 2001). Such integration of
experiences and understanding facilitates a deeper sense of
meaning-making. With scripture parallel, one finds scripture
passages that resonate with or parallel his or her own experi-
ences. This is expected to facilitate meaning, hope, and heal-
ing (Hughes & Handzo, 2010; Landau, Mittal, & Wieling,
2008). By reframing God assumptions, one reexamines their
own assumptions about God and God's character. This
includes reframing harmful spiritual attributions that may
contribute to spiritual distress (Harris et al., 2008; Shaw
et al., 2005). Finally, a chaplain can encourage connection
with a spiritual community. This is expected to facilitate
healing through connection with a healthy supportive com-
munity (Hautamäki & Coleman, 2001; Walsh, 2007).
Other Services
Mantra repetition is considered a spiritual care specialty
intervention (Hughes & Handzo, 2010). A mantra represents
a word, thought, or sensation--of religious or spiritual sig-
nificance or with no particular meaning--repeated by the
individual (Chan, 2014). A spiritual care provider can utilize
mantra repetition as a way to focus the patient's attention and
to bring clarity of the mind. Such an intervention can be par-
ticularly helpful with intrusive recollection, avoidance/
numbing, and hyper-vigilance (Bormann et al., 2005).
Creative writing is another specialty intervention for spiri-
tual care providers (Hughes & Handzo, 2010). Through this
intervention, at-risk individuals can discover insights, pro-
cess grief, and loss, and get in touch with difficult emotions.
Moreover, such interventions afford the opportunity to inte-
grate life experiences over time into a deeper understanding
of self and relationship to one's environment. The spiritual
care provider can facilitate a process in which the patient cre-
atively expresses his or her feelings about the trauma,
describing how it has affected his or her life. This may also
include exploration of the Veteran's feelings in the context of
religious and/or spiritual distress (Knaevelsrud & Maercker,
2007).
From Theory to Practice
There are certain common threads which link at-risk Veterans
who engage in chaplaincy services. VA chaplains note that
many at-risk Veterans report a history of abuse prior to their
time in the military. This would include emotional/psycho-
logical, physical, or sexual abuse, or frequently a combina-
tion of all three. Oftentimes, the Veteran's family of origin
was also dysfunctional.
This climate is thought to give way to a degree of negative
affect, including feelings of vulnerability, fear, self-image
issues, and an inability to trust. The Veteran's emotional
response to their circumstances typically includes anger,
shame/blame, or guilt. They adapt to this climate by develop-
ing several protective responses. What emerges is an inabil-
ity to be vulnerable after so many years of having one's
vulnerability violated. Chaplains observe that such individu-
als will actively seek out and pursue control whenever
stressed or placed in a trying situation. Security and protec-
tion are gained through manipulation. Many of these Veterans
will then begin to contemplate suicidal behavior after finding
themselves in circumstances devoid of the possibility of con-
trol, security, and/or protection.
A typical case will involve a VA chaplain responding to a
request for services made by a patient in a locked-down psy-
chiatric ward. The patient will most likely have a long his-
tory of suicide ideation, usually with at least one suicide
attempt. As related to his or her experiences of religion and/
or spirituality, the patient will typically profess anger with
and confusion about God, feelings of rejection by God, and
ambivalence toward life and living. They have skeptically
searched for some form of meaning in their lives and perhaps
tried to establish some type of relationship with a higher
power. The end result is that the idea of a loving God, who is
all-powerful, does not make sense to them. Either God does
not love him or her, or God is not all-powerful. Some will
move toward an atheistic or agnostic worldview as a means
of lessening their religious and/or spiritual pain.
An addictive cycle might develop as other coping skills
diminish and fail to provide relief. However, this cycle fails
to restore the sense of meaning and purpose that they seek
6 SAGE Open
(Allen, Nieuwsma, Pollitt, & Blazer, 2014). For some, their
failed search for meaning and purpose proves intolerable,
even more so than before their addictive disorder began. At
this stage, many patients will report contemplating suicidal
behavior.
In collaboration with other clinical mental health provid-
ers, VA chaplains help the patient rediscover the meaning
and purpose otherwise missing in his or her lives. A new-
found sense of religious and/or spiritual well-being, based on
a renewed sense of meaning and purpose, may help the at-
risk Veteran to better deal with his or her difficult circum-
stances (Baumeister, 1990). Select outcomes for spiritual and
pastoral care include increased self-acceptance, better con-
necting with others, and, when appropriate for the Veteran,
reestablishing a relationship with a higher power, benevolent
deity, or God.
Conclusion
The aim of this discussion paper was to provide practical
insight into the spiritual and pastoral care needs of Veterans
at increased risk of suicide and present the framework in
which VA chaplains attempt to address those needs. As
research examining the different correlates of suicidal behav-
ior among Veteran populations continues to develop, increas-
ing attention will most likely be drawn to the spiritual and
pastoral care needs of at-risk Veterans. Clinical chaplains
represent a professional group qualified to address these
needs in health care settings.
Making chaplaincy services the focus of empirical
research would invariably help provide an evidence base for
applying these services to at-risk populations. At present,
spiritual care constitutes a complementary and alternative
medicine modality (Barrett et al., 2003). However, no studies
or clinical trials have taken place to assess the clinical useful-
ness or applicability of spiritual care as part of suicide pre-
vention efforts. Of note is that chaplaincy services are rarely
provided as a stand-alone service, but rather as part of an
interdisciplinary team. Most individuals who seek pastoral
care support will also access clinical providers specially
trained to formally diagnose and treat mental health disor-
ders (Schindler, Berren, Hannah, Beigel, & Santiago, 1987).
Health care professionals are becoming increasingly
mindful of religious sensitivities among their patients, the
salutary benefits associated with religion and spirituality,
that most Americans and clinicians hold some type of reli-
gious beliefs, and the influence of such beliefs on the lives of
those who espouse them (Budd, 1999). As these professional
groups look to be more attentive to the needs of the at-risk
Veterans under their care, they should remain mindful that
some of the complaints voiced by at-risk Veterans may be
indicative of a need for religious and/or spiritual support
(Kopacz, Silver, & Bossarte, 2014). To this end, in collabora-
tion with other health care providers, clinical chaplains are
