Special Collection - Interest Groups
Introduction
In 2004, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda agreed to form a
Customs Union (CU) including the introduction of a
Common External Tariff (CET). Ten years later, countries
have to ask themselves how common their external tariff
really is. In 2014, countries applied unilateral exemptions on
more than a hundred tariff lines, among which were highly
traded goods such as vehicles, rice, and cement. The Union's
Director General for Customs and Trade, Peter Kiguta, com-
plains about this practice in an interview with the author
(Interview 91): "If the tariff keeps changing, this year it is
like this, this year this country asks for that, then this instabil-
ity brings unpredictability for investors and trade." This phe-
nomenon is part of a larger issue in trade policy. Trade
policy-making is rarely driven by considerations of welfare,
but is a popular tool for redistribution among different inter-
est groups (Rodrik, 1995).
However, when a country enters a CU, a level is added to
the process of negotiating tariff levels. Tariff levels towards
nonmember states are now determined in negotiations among
the member states of the CU. Interest groups that were influ-
ential in one state might not be in another while other groups
might be able to align their positions across countries.
Similarly, interstate bargaining and the CU's institutional
rules and structures will shape the way that tariffs are set.
Clearly, CUs provide interesting case studies for the field of
international political economy (IPE) to study the forces
behind trade policy-making. However, the relatively small
number of existing CUs has limited the number of case stud-
ies thus far. Especially, little attention has been paid to the
advances on the African continent. This article will address
the East African Community's (EAC) CU in particular, as it
has often been referred to as the most advanced regional eco-
nomic community (African Development Bank, 2014) and
may serve as a model for other CUs on the continent.
This article will study the political economy of the EAC's
CET after its establishment from 2005 to 2015. It focuses on
discussing how interest group behavior has contributed to
the instability of the CET in this period. Since 2005, coun-
tries have made increasing use of CET exemption schemes.
Guided by domestic interests, they often unilaterally applied
a different tariff rate from the CET and avoided the task of
consensus-formation on regional CET levels.
Both the changes of essential tariff lines in the CET and
the wide use of exemption schemes indicate that the CET

How Common Is the East African
Community's Common External Tariff
Really? The Influence of Interest Groups
on the EAC's Tariff Negotiations
Tobias Bünder1
Abstract
Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda founded a Customs Union in 2004 and apply a Common External Tariff (CET) on imports to
the region. However, the CET has been increasingly destabilized by countries using unilateral exemptions on a wide range
of strongly traded goods. This instability undermines progress in regional integration and creates an uneven playing field for
business. The article discusses evidence for the influence of interest groups on the observed instability. This study takes a
political economy perspective and tracks lobbying behavior from the domestic to the regional level. It looks at the influence
of business membership organizations and other interest groups on CET negotiations. The article applies an exploratory,
qualitative approach predominantly drawing on data gathered by the author in 25 interviews with experts in Kenya, Tanzania,
and Uganda in January 2016.

plays an important role in protecting certain interests. The
article will ask how the instability in the CET can be explained
and why member states tend to fall back into national exemp-
tion schemes for some industries, but agree on regional CET
changes for others. The article shows that domestic interest
groups are effective in proactively influencing member states
in their stance on external tariffs. The EAC's institutional
structure enables states to make use of exemption schemes
and to put national over regional interests in CET negotia-
tions. A regional approach to tariff-setting is only taken if
domestic interests overlap or transnational industries put
pressure on governments to stick to harmonized CET levels.
In its analysis, the article will track lobbying behavior
from the domestic to the regional level. The article will apply
a qualitative approach predominantly drawing on data gath-
ered by the author in 25 key informant interviews. To start,
the article will give an overview of the relevant literature.
Subsequently, the article will explain the framework of anal-
ysis and its methodology. Diving into the case study, the
article will provide background information on the EAC CU
and its CET. As a next step, the article will turn toward the
analysis of the application of the CET from 2005 to 2015,
discussing interest groups in the founding Member States of
Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, and then turn to the dynamics
of CET negotiations on the regional level.
Literature Review
Traditionally, the study of international institutions and
agreements looked at the level of interstate bargaining (Lake,
2009). However, literature shows that multiple factors of
domestic politics shape the national position in the interna-
tional arena (Aklin, Arias, Deniz, & Rosendorff, 2015).
Among them, interest group politics plays an important role.
This literature review will discuss the underlying structures
of interest group competition in trade policy-making and
interest group involvement in political processes, and present
some insights on interest group politics on the regional level.
Foundations of Interest Group Competition
To understand the dynamics of interest groups within trade
policy debates, one has to outline how losses and gains from
trade policy are distributed. Trade theories can give a first
hint. The Heckscher­Ohlin model predicts that trade patterns
depend on the factor endowments of an economy. Building on
these insights, the Stolper­Samuelson theorem suggests that
trade liberalization will benefit the owners of the relatively
abundant factor and leave the owners of the relatively scarce
factors worse off. Resulting from this theory is a class-based
division of policy preferences where owners of capital would
mostly clash with labor over liberalizing or restricting trade
(Rogowski, 1990). This seems to have been a reasonable
assumption in many industrialized countries like the United
States (Leamer, 1984; Persson & Tabellini, 2000).
The major challenge to the Stolper­Samuelson theorem
comes from the Ricardo-Viner model. Due to the immobility
of capital and labor, all actors' preferences for trade policy
depend on the industry in which they are situated. Thus, con-
flict is not along class lines or production factors, but along
sectors. In a study of industrialized economies, Hiscox
(2002) finds that trade conflicts have moved from class lines
to sectors with decreasing factor mobility since the mid-20th
century. Mayda and Rodrik (2005) also present evidence for
the Ricardo-Viner model. Conflicts also often occur within a
sector between manufacturers and traders at different stages
of the value-chain, which the article will also discuss in the
case of the EAC. Underlying all models is the assumption
that interests are defined by economic gain. However, other
drivers for trade preferences of individuals exist like the
degree of nationalist sentiments (Mansfield & Mutz, 2009)
or a population's education levels (Hainmueller & Hiscox,
2006). Likewise, other interest groups like civil society orga-
nizations or international donors in a developing country set-
ting are often overlooked.
Interest Groups in Trade-Policy Processes
The extent to which interest groups may influence trade
policy outcomes depends on how they are organized and
integrated into policy-making. Grossman and Helpman
(1994, 2001) show that policy outcomes depend on a com-
petition between lobbying activities of different groups.
This might include legitimate behavior (e.g., researching
on effects of trade policy options), as well as illegal aspects
(e.g., bribing ministers to protect special interests). The lat-
ter may be especially strong where institutions are weak
(Campos & Giovanni, 2008).
The main focus of trade policy analysis on this level has
been on firms and industries. The organizational strength of
consumers is limited by the free-rider problem and the wide-
spreadofpotentialwelfaregains(Baldwin,1989).Consumers
may only exert an influence on trade policy through their
voting behavior. In contrast, firms are often well-organized
entities that have resources and channels to engage in policy
discussions and are directly affected by policies. The strength
of industry lobbies depends on the motivation of the largest
firm (Bombardini, 2008) as well as industry characteristics
like a large capital stock, an inelastic demand function, a
small number of capital owners, and that the industry is geo-
graphically concentrated. The immobile factors in the manu-
facturing sector seem to be more concentrated in developing
countries (Hung & Quyen, 2007) than the mobile factor.
Hence, capital and land are often better organized in devel-
oping countries than labor or small-scale farmers. In devel-
oping countries, firm heterogeneity determines their
involvement in policy-making: Factors like employment
size, government ownership, age, or participation in business
associations matter for lobbying influence (Hall & Deardorff,
2006; Weymouth, 2012).
Bünder 3
Domestic political institutions will affect trade policy-
making by aggregating the preferences of interest groups and
determining if and how these groups can turn their interests
into policy. Here, political systems matter with some evi-
dence pointing to stronger business influence in democracies
than autocracies (Keefer, 2007; Weymouth, 2012). On top of
that, the type of representative framework plays a role.
Lobbying tends to target different institutions depending on
whether the country follows a majoritarian or proportional
representation system parties (Grossman & Helpman, 2001;
Persson & Tabellini, 2002). Yet, the structure of domestic
institutions in the EAC only partially reflects the political
realities including issues like ethnic voting, corruption, or
overly dominant political leaders. Thus, the article will not
go deeper into this issue when analyzing interest group poli-
tics in trade policy-making.
Interest Groups on a Regional Level
Moving up from the domestic level, the article will also
study the influence of regionally organized interest groups
on the CET negotiations. The European Union (EU) provides
an advanced case study of the impact of interest group influ-
ence in a regional integration context. Moravscik (1998) sees
domestic interest groups as the main driver of EU integra-
tion. Transnationally organized lobby groups often helped to
build bargaining agreements (Moravscik, 1993). With regard
to trade policy-making, Dür (2008) finds that EU trade pol-
icy strongly reflects the preferences of economic interest
groups. Business groups that are active on multiple levels of
EU policy-making and target domestic as well as regional
processes are the most successful in getting their voices
heard (Eising, 2004). Resource-rich groups are the most
effective lobbying groups in the EU context. Likewise, busi-
ness associations tend to be more active on the regional level
than civil society or other nonbusiness groups (Dür & Mateo,
2012). Michalowitz (2007) shows that interest groups were
mainly successful in targeting technical aspects of policy
rather than more fundamental political directions. Yet, over-
all there is no clear tendency in the literature if integration
has given interest groups better or worse access to political
processes (Eising, 2008). This article may contribute to the
overall discussion by discussing evidence from both the
domestic and regional level in the EAC.
Thoughts on Research Method and
Model
The article will connect the instability in the CET to the poli-
tics of interest groups discussed above. Given the very lim-
ited number of studies on interest group politics and the EAC
CET available, the article will adopt an exploratory approach
to research (George & Bennett, 2005; Stebbins, 2001).
Exploratory research can be a helpful approach to gain
insights into previously unstudied fields and understand
actors and processes in the background. Unlike confirmatory
research, it cannot test hypotheses, but helps to form assump-
tions and ideas (Stebbins, 2001). Thus, this article will limit
itself to setting out bold assertions (Emmel, 2013) for its
analysis. It will then present and discuss evidence for and
against those assertions gathered with exploratory methods.
The research is built around 25 semistructured expert
interviews that the author conducted in Kenya, Tanzania, and
Uganda. The existing literature on the EAC CU is limited and
focuses mainly on trade and welfare effects of the CU (Buigut,
2012; Busse & Shams, 2003, etc.). Thus, for information on
negotiation dynamics and industry-specific details, the author
needed to collect new data. Expert interviews are considered
an effective tool in exploratory research, as they provide fast
access to an unknown field and provide a high insight in
aggregated and specific knowledge (Bogner, Littig, & Menz,
2009). Experts according to Meuser and Nagel (1991) are
persons who have privileged access to information about
groups of persons or decision processes at stake.
In exploratory research, the selection of cases or inter-
viewees cannot be random, but rather follows a purposeful
sampling strategy, as one wants to analyze the richest and
most telling cases (Emmel, 2013; Reiter, 2013) available. In
the case of this article, the author talked to representatives of
ministries responsible for trade, revenue authorities, and pri-
vate sector stakeholders and selected other experts on the
topic in all three countries. In addition, interviews were held
with key officers at the EAC Secretariat as well as with the
East African Business Council. While some key informants
were selected based on their positions within organizations,
others followed by a snowballing method (Bogner et al.,
2009) meaning that already interviewed experts allowed
access to additional interviewees.
Interviewing experts as a layperson, as often the case in
exploratory interviewing, involves an asymmetry in knowledge,
which makes it difficult for the interviewer to follow a struc-
tured set of questions (Bogner & Menz, 2009). Thus, the author
used a basic set of interview themes tailored to the organization
and position of the interviewees. It is important to understand
that such exploratory interviews cannot generate completely
objective data. Hence, the article relies on anecdotal evidence
derived directly from the expert interviews, which the author
directly cites from the transcripts. To mitigate this pitfall of
exploratory research, the author triangulated interview state-
ments by asking for confirmation from other interviewees or
finding supportive information in the literature.
The author asked all interview partners for their consent to
be interviewed, recorded, and quoted in this article with their
name. Those who did not want to be named are referred to as
an anonymous representative of their organization. The
appendix provides an overview of all interviews conducted.2
Finally, for reasons of scope, resources, and political instabil-
ity, the author did not manage to visit Rwanda and Burundi.
Due to their small economic size and their presence in transi-
tion schemes, their omission should not distort results.

In the next section, the article will first outline the phe-
nomenon it seeks to explain: the instability in the EAC's
CET (composed of unilateral exemptions and CET changes).
Subsequently, it will explore evidence on how interest group
behavior contributes to the observed CET instability both on
domestic and on regional level. Looking at the domestic
level, the research will be guided by the following bold
assertion:
·
· If domestic interest groups are strongly organized and
lobby on tariff policy, government is more likely to
look out for special interests in tariff-setting leading to
more CET instability.
Next, the article will explore why states use unilateral exemp-
tions in some cases and regional solutions in others. Thus,
the article will look at both regional CET negotiation struc-
tures and the role of regional interest groups following two
bold assertions:
·
· If tariff-setting is intergovernmental, domestic interest
groups will have a higher impact on tariff negotiations.
·
· If regional interest groups are actively lobbying,
countries are more likely to prioritize regional solu-
tions leading to less CET instability.
The EAC CU and the CET
Design of the CU and the CET
The EAC dates back to colonial times when the British colo-
nial administration treated the region as one, building rail-
way lines and establishing a CU in 1919 between what is
now Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania (Reith & Boltz, 2011). In
1967, the newly independent countries formed the first EAC.
After only 10 years, the community collapsed in 1977 due to
structural and ideological conflicts (Kibua & Tostensen,
2005; Maasdorp, 1999; McKay, Milner, & Morrissey, 1998).
After Uganda settled internal conflicts and Tanzania moved
away from socialism in the 1990s, the three EAC states
restarted cooperation efforts culminating in the formation of
the CU in 2005.
It is governed by the Customs Union Protocol (EAC,
2004a) as well as the 2004 Customs Management Act (EAC,
2004b). Countries eliminated tariffs on intraregional trade
and have introduced a CET. All EAC states are members of
World Trade Organization (WTO), but had large room to set
tariff levels, as their bound tariffs lay far above the applied
rates. Nonetheless, negotiating the specifications of the CET,
the countries had signed up to the idea of open regionalism
aiming at a trade-friendly CET (Interview 9).
The EAC CET has three tariff bands: 0%, 10%, and 25%.
As an orientation, the first category incorporates raw materi-
als and capital goods and the second intermediate products.
The third band includes most final goods and agricultural
commodities produced in the region. Agricultural goods
attract a simple average tariff of 20.2%, while nonagricul-
tural goods lie at 12.7% only (WTO, 2012). In addition, there
is a list of sensitive products that included 58 tariff lines at
the beginning, but has shrunk since (EAC, 2004b, 2012). The
list contains mostly agricultural goods as well as a selection
of locally manufactured items. The list's items were widely
produced in the region and should hence receive special pro-
tection from imports.
The CU Protocol included one exemption to the CET, the
duty-remission scheme (DRS): For the purpose of export pro-
motion, countries can annually announce a selection of com-
panies that may import specific products duty-free as input
for manufacturing. In some cases (e.g., sugar for industrial
use), industries were chosen jointly as a region. Moreover,
countriesapplyforso-called"staysofapplication."Originally,
those were meant to smooth the implementation of the CET
and stay at some pre-CET levels for a transition period. Yet, it
became accepted practice to use the channel to derogate from
CET for other reasons. Theoretically, states have to prove that
they cannot source enough of a product regionally to be
allowed to apply a lower tariff rate or convince the other
countries that their industry needs special protection for a
limited time. In practice, derogations are rarely based on evi-
dence. EAC stakeholders see this third channel as especially
problematic and open for abuse (Interview 9).
Any change of CET or a unilateral derogation of the CET
has to be approved by the Council of Ministers, the main
executive body of the EAC. Member states prepare their
positions on the annual tariff negotiations in consultation
with domestic stakeholders. Regional negotiations begin
among technical staff. However, the political level regularly
makes amendments to their recommendations. Political
vetoes are powerful as the EAC works with consensus-based
decision-making. The EAC Secretariat has no supranational
power in trade and serves predominantly as a facilitator for
the negotiations and gives advice on what would be benefi-
cial for the Community.
Finally, countries have kept several national support
schemesthatarenotregulatedonregionallevel.Governments
do not have to notify Partner States which industries receive
rebates. Especially Kenya's "Tax Remission for Exports
Office (TREO)" has been named as causing distortions of the
regional market. Yet, this article will focus only on the dero-
gation channels that are accounted for in the CU. The lack of
regional oversight makes it hard to analyze schemes like
TREO.
Instabilities in the CET
This section will give an overview of the instability in the
CET stemming from both unilateral exemptions and CET
changes between 2005 and 2015. Representatives of the
Secretariat (Interview 1) argue that only a fraction of tariff
lines have been unstable since the beginning of the CU.
Bünder 5
However, the changes incorporate many of the most impor-
tant tariff lines for local industry and traders like steel,
cement, transport equipment, and even some agricultural
commodities. Private sector representatives also complain
that the CET is being undermined by exemptions and changes
(Interview 15; Interview 16). It is difficult to plan for the
long term if tariffs can change every year. The Secretariat's
Director General for Trade, Peter Kiguta, worries, "For me
as DG, I like to see stability in the CET. That it is predictable.
That would let EAC have a better environment for trade and
investors" (Interview 9).
Looking at Figure 1, one can see that the total instability
has increased since the founding of the CU. For further anal-
ysis, it is also interesting to focus on which industries have
been in the center of the fluctuations and in which countries
national approaches occur especially frequently.
In Table 1, one can see that unilateral derogations from
the CET have strongly increased from only about 15 to 20
tariff lines in the first 5 years to 56, 107, and 73 in 2013-
2015, respectively. Similarly, changes to the regional CET
have also been made more frequently.
Looking at the type of goods featured in Table 1, one can
identify several categories that appear prominently. First, the
agricultural commodities of wheat, barley, rice, and sugar
can be found in the unilateral derogations as well as in the
DRS. However, industrial goods make up the major share of
derogations. Three product categories appear to be especially
interesting to single out for analysis: paper and paper prod-
ucts, cement, and iron and steel products. Paper has been in
the DRS of all countries to provide their processing indus-
tries with cheap inputs. In 2014, 36 tariff lines of paper prod-
ucts were reclassified from final to intermediate goods. Yet,
Kenya as well as Tanzania immediately applied unilateral
exemptions. Iron and steel products saw a similar develop-
ment. After a short period of unilateral import protection in
the Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, the CET was increased on
17 tariff lines. Though, countries also made further unilateral
changes to iron and steel tariff lines. Kenya, Tanzania, and
Uganda unilaterally increased tariffs on additional products
for which no regional consensus could be reached. Cement
used to be initially on the list of sensitive items, but was
removed temporarily in 2008 and permanently in 2014.
When asked to name sectors with regionally active interest
groups, interviewees regularly came back to paper, cement,
and iron and steel products. Accordingly, the subsequent dis-
cussions in this article will often refer back to these indus-
tries and discuss connections between these product lines
and interest group behavior.
Overall, each derogation and CET change appears very
selective and industry- or even product-specific rather than
being part of a greater trade policy agenda. This indicates
that tariffs have increasingly been used to cater for domestic
or regional interest groups. The subsequent analysis will take
a closer look at this relationship.
Analysis
Domestic Level
This section will discuss several explanatory factors for the
instability of the CET within domestic politics of tariff nego-
tiations before moving on to study the regional negotiation
dynamics. It looks at evidence around the first bold assertion
presented earlier: If domestic interest groups are strongly
organized and lobby on tariff policy, government is more
likely to look out for special interests in tariff-setting leading
to more CET instability. The article will first give an overview
of major interest groups and their preferences on tariffs in the
three countries. Thereafter, it will analyze how interest groups
are organized domestically and to which degree that has
helped them to realize their preferences in tariff negotiations.
Mapping domestic interest groups and their tariff preferences.To
understand the landscape of interest groups, one has to estab-
lish how the interests in tariff levels are distributed among
stakeholders. For this, we look at the manufacturing sector,
the agricultural sector, and government interests. Most man-
ufacturing industries favor higher tariffs on goods similar to
their production profiles, as they struggle to compete on
price with imports. A competition between interests in manu-
facturing arises between vertically integrated companies and
processing companies. A product of Producer A might be an
input for Producer B. Producer A is interested in higher tar-
iffs to protect it from imports. Producer B, however, prefers
to import the same product cheaply and would like to see
lower tariffs. Kiguta (Interview 9) states that this was the
major line of conflict in the negotiations for the CET. Several
industries identified in the section "Interest Groups on a
Regional Level" as having a highly unstable CET experience
this upstream versus downstream conflict.
This was, for example, the case for the regional paper
industry. A small number of paper producers in Tanzania and
Kenya managed to secure high tariffs on imports of raw

paper, while paper converters had to resort to make use of the
DRS or lobby for unilateral derogation of the CET (Interview
15). In the iron and steel industries, a similar development
took place. The steel value-chain has four major production
steps (Interview 12): Most of the smaller producers in the
three countries are active in processing intermediate steel
products into construction material like roofing sheets or
wire mesh. Yet, a few larger companies are engaging in the
production of such intermediates from raw iron and steel.
These manufacturers have long been lobbying for protective
tariffs, but politicians kept tariffs at 10%, mostly for the ben-
efit of downstream processors, the construction industry and
their electorate, which tends to be particularly price-sensitive
in low-income countries.
For the agricultural producers, the interests are more
homogeneous. While there are larger producers in wheat or
sugar, most farms are small scale. However, all groups
depend on protection through tariffs. Lower tariffs on the
import of staple produce such as beans or maize would
threaten the livelihood of many. In this sense, food is more
sensitive than manufactured products, as the majority of pop-
ulation works in agriculture in all three countries (ILO,
2012). Competition between interest groups enters via the
food-processing industries, which are interested in cheap
imports of wheat, sugar, and barley. To give producers cheap
access to these inputs without opening the door for consumer
imports, all countries use the DRS for these goods in most
years. In addition, Kenya has been derogating from the CET
nearly every year since its existence by applying lower tariffs
on rice and wheat, while Tanzania and Uganda did the same
for wheat alone. This could be linked to urban consumers'
interests in lower food prices which can be enabled by reduc-
ing import tariffs on selected staple food.
Thinking about different interest groups among produc-
ers and consumers, one has to take into account the particu-
lar interests of governments regarding tariffs, too. Two
aspects could be especially relevant in this regard: consid-
erations of public revenue and private interests of govern-
ment officials. Revenue aspects were at the center of the
discussions of the CU, but ended up not being highly influ-
ential. Since the existence of the CU, the shares of customs
and other import duties of total government revenue have
decreased in all three countries. Yet, there was consensus
during the initial negotiations that revenue aspects should
not motivate CET decisions and undermine the policy of
open regionalism (Interview 9). The countries accepted that
they had to look for alternatives to replace revenue losses
from lower tariffs (Interview 17). While certain tariffs, for
instance, on vehicles (Interview 18), are still important
from a revenue perspective, the influence of these consider-
ations has fallen. For example, cement used to be on the
sensitive list with a rate of 55% and produced much reve-
nue due to high consumption. Yet, its tariff rate has been
gradually reduced, as the affordability of construction proj-
ects increased in importance.
An expert from the EU who was involved in the negotia-
tions on the EAC-EU Economic Partnership Agreement
(Interview 23) suggested that vested interests of govern-
ments are a decisive factor in EAC trade policy-making. It is
difficult to pinpoint where these interests are located exactly,
but it is possible to highlight some sectors in each country
that are prone to private investments by government offi-
cials. Transparency International's Country Director for
Kenya, Samuel Kimeu (Interview 10), argues that Kenyan
policy-makers often use trade policy to protect their own
business investments. Top statesmen in government and
opposition are often family members of business leaders.
Kimeu further argues, "In any conversation about trade there
is an uncle that will be missed" (Interview 10). Kenyan poli-
ticians often come from Kenya's richest families that have
invested in agriculture, as well as into certain areas of manu-
facturing (Interview 10; New World Wealth, 2014). Kenyan
president, Uhuru Kenyatta, in office since 2013, and his fam-
ily dominate the regional dairy market, for example. Jensen,
Strycharz, and Keyser (2010) argue that vested interests are
particularly visible in this area. Dairy received stable protec-
tion in the CET with yoghurt and cheese as the only products
to be added to the sensitive list since 2015.
In Tanzania and Uganda, politicians are less invested in
productive industries (Interview 20). Political stability in
Kenya brought about elite networks in which business and
political power are often combined in a family or single per-
son (Spooner & Ngunyi, 2006), while politicians in Uganda
and Tanzania have acquired wealth more recently. That also
affects in which sectors politicians have become economi-
cally active. In Uganda, the civil war of the 1980s has stopped
politicians from moving into long-term manufacturing
investments. They are rather interested in real estate, tour-
ism, or the transport sector (Interview 20; Interview 2). In
Tanzania, socialism made it difficult for politicians to
become players in business for a long time. Nowadays, poli-
ticians'personal interests can be found in construction, trans-
port and mining, as well as in former state-owned companies,
especially in cash crops like sugar, for example (Cooksey &
Kelsall, 2011). In comparison, the degree of proximity
between private and public sector in Kenya is unique.
Bagabo's (Interview 2) opinion gives you a glance into this
relationship: "When you are negotiating [with Kenya] you
don't know if you are talking to the government or the pri-
vate sector." Their closeness may allow private sector play-
ers a better access to the negotiation table than in Tanzania or
Uganda.
This section has given an overview of different stakehold-
er's preferences in tariff-setting, showing that manufacturing
interests are less homogeneous than in agriculture and that
revenue interests have lost importance for governments,
while their members' private business interests may affect
tariff levels substantially. Based on this landscape of interest
groups, the article will continue to study how the level of
organization of these groups contributed to CET instability.
8 SAGE Open
Organization of interest groups. In this section, the article will
analyze how the interest groups discussed above are orga-
nized and how that corresponds to the extent to which they
benefit from tariff-setting.
In Kenya, unilateral tariff increases imply higher protec-
tion from imports for a wide array of manufacturing indus-
tries including iron and steel processors, paper manufacturers,
or fishing net producers. The number of unilateral tariff dero-
gations has been higher than in the other two countries com-
bined (see Table 1). Even though its manufacturing sector is
the biggest in the EAC, with 12% of value-added to national
GDP and 7% of overall employment, it still makes up only a
small share of the economy. Thus, the sector receives a dis-
proportional amount of import protection. Part of the reason
may be that the Kenyan manufacturers are strongly orga-
nized and are highly engaged in the negotiations of the CET.
The Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) is the sole
representative for the manufacturing sector, and almost all
companies channel their lobbying efforts through the asso-
ciation (Interview 19; Interview 15). KAM is described as
politically well connected, having strong technical capaci-
ties, and usually being the first private sector actor for the
government to consult (Interview 24; Interview 2; Interview
17). Kenyan public sector representatives have unanimously
stated that KAM is the most influential domestic negotiation
partner on tariff issues (Interview 13; Interview 17). All
major CET changes favoring Kenyan industry can be traced
back to KAM lobbying efforts. Thus, the organizational
strength of manufacturers in Kenya helps to explain CET
changes to manufacturing's favor.
Agricultural tariffs have experienced less instability.
Kenya unilaterally decreased tariffs on wheat and rice in
many years and allowed companies to import cheap sugar for
industrial processing. Generally though, the tariffs remained
quite high. Yet, the Kenya National Farmers' Federation
(KENAFF) is less engaged in tariff negotiations compared
with KAM. The Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA)
represents agricultural interests on the CET, but in KEPSA,
agriculture is just one among many sectors (Interview 21).
The stable high tariff protection for farmers is more likely to
be connected to the political importance of agriculture in
Kenya. With 59% of the working population in agriculture,
farmers are a decisive electoral block that needs to be satis-
fied. The voice of consumer groups is completely missing in
tariff negotiations in Kenya, but politicians have an interest
in keeping essential goods affordable to appeal to voters.
This could help to explain the constant application of a
below-CET rate on rice which is cheaper to import from Asia
than from EAC partners (Interview 17).
In the case of Tanzania, the number of unilateral deroga-
tions was much smaller. In 2007 and 2008 pharmaceutical
manufacturers and in 2014 and 2015 paper manufacturers as
well as iron and steel processors received some tariff protec-
tion. This corresponds to the observation that no interest
group involved in the tariff negotiations is well organized.
The main representative for the manufacturing sector is the
Confederation of Tanzanian Industries (CTI). Yet, compared
with KAM, the organization has been less successful in unit-
ing the manufacturing sector. A source at CTI (Interview 14)
stated that they compete with the Chamber of Commerce,
Industry and Agriculture (TCCIA) and the Tanzanian Private
Sector Foundation (TPSF) over which organization speaks
on the industry's behalf on tariff issues. As a result, CTI
struggles with membership. Only about 300 of ca. 2000
industrial companies with more than 10 employees are part
of CTI. This creates free-rider problems and prevents a har-
monized lobbying approach. Moreover, government is seen
as less reliable and proactive in engaging with private sector
organizations on tariff matters. For instance, CTI complained
about the government agreeing to a CET increase on iron
products that were inputs for most local processors without
consulting CTI on such a proposal. According to CTI, some
firms thus prefer to lobby via their private connections with
political decision-makers (Interview 14). In these cases, it
might be easier for the government to protect cronies with
nontariff measures that also shield companies against Kenyan
competition. CTI sees Tanzania's local content clause on
tobacco for cigarette manufacturing as an example for that
practice (Interview 14).
Like in Kenya, agricultural interest groups are not as
involved in discussions about tariffs, but tariff levels have
remained consistently high with some exceptions: Wheat
and sugar for industrial production were repeatedly imported
at a below-CET rate. Moreover, the government issued zero-
duty import licenses for rice and sugar in 2011 and 2012
without gazetting at the EAC to decrease consumer prices
much to the disarray of local farmers (Cooksey, 2016). Yet,
most stakeholders are small-scale farmers and have limited
capacity to organize (Interview 6). Their political interest is
mainly represented through associations of producers of
export-oriented cash crops like horticulture, tobacco, or cof-
fee (Interview 2), as well as in the case of small-scale farm-
ers working in outgrowing schemes for politically better
connected food-processing industries like sugar, for exam-
ple. Nonetheless, given that 73% of Tanzanians work in agri-
culture, there is a political motivation for keeping agricultural
tariffs high even without organized pressure. Thus, for
Tanzania, the role of organized interest groups in tariff-set-
ting is less clear. Special interests find their way into the
negotiations, but rather via more informal networks. For
instance, Bagabo (2012) states that the unilateral tariff reduc-
tions on heavy-duty vehicles were mainly due to pressure
from powerful importers with direct links to government.
Finally, in Uganda, unilateral tariff increases were rare
besides protection for some iron and steel products. However,
Uganda has had the highest number of unilateral decreases
every year making imports cheaper. With the background of
Uganda being landlocked and dependent on imports, the
association of traders, Kampala City Traders' Associations
(KACITA), was observed to be influential in negotiations
Bünder 9
lobbying for lower tariffs (Interview 9; Interview 11). The
Uganda Manufacturers' Association (UMA) is also involved
in the tariff discussions, but faces capacity constraints. For
instance, a board member of Roofings, the largest Ugandan
manufacturer of steel products, told the author that he had
personally to sponsor UMA delegations to be able to join
regional tariff discussions. In the end, the only national excep-
tions achieved in the negotiations protected several products
of Roofings. Due to the weakness of associations, large com-
panies are also more prone directly to approach government.
Paul Bagabo, a local trade policy analyst, argues in an inter-
view: "The firms no longer see the apex body as important. If
you have an issue, you go directly. President Museveni will
handle it at that level . . . Most of the powerful private sector
people have access to him" (Interview 2).
Agricultural groups appear also as less strongly orga-
nized. A notable exception here is the sugar sector which is
well-connected in Uganda (Interview 25). In general, similar
to Kenya and Tanzania, the political importance of agricul-
ture helps to keep agricultural tariffs high (Interview 11).
To conclude this section, let's revisit the bold statement
from the beginning: If domestic interest groups are strongly
organized and lobby on tariff policy, government is more
likely to look out for special interests in tariff-setting leading
to more CET instability. The analysis has found some evi-
dence in its favor: In Kenya, where manufacturing was well
organized, CET derogations to the group's benefit occurred
frequently. In Uganda, organized traders coincide with a
large number of import-easing derogations. However, the
article also showed that tariff levels have been very favorable
to other interest groups that did not show high organizational
capacity: In agriculture, high tariffs are politically important
due to the large share of rural voters in all countries.
Moreover, a large share of fluctuations in the CET seems too
specific to be a result of organized group lobbying and might
be better explained by informal relationships between indi-
vidual companies and political decision-makers. Finally,
special interests of government individuals are harder to
detect, but highly influential in the negotiations nonetheless.
Regional Level
In the previous section, the article showed that tariff prefer-
ences in all EAC countries are heavily influenced by domes-
tic interest groups. All countries have strong domestic
interests on their mind when entering the annual CET nego-
tiations. Subsequently, the author will demonstrate how the
institutional structures of the EAC enable countries to stick
to these national positions and how regionally active interest
groups affect negotiations.
Institutional structure and derogations. The article will turn to
its second bold assertion: If tariff-setting is intergovern-
mental, domestic interest groups will have a higher impact
on tariff negotiations. This section will show how the
intergovernmental character of tariff negotiations allowed
for the CET instability to evolve, as it strongly facilitates
influence of lobbying on the domestic level.
All decision-making in the EAC remains completely
intergovernmental: The full authority for trade issues lies
with the EAC Council of Ministers (EAC, 2004b). While the
tariff negotiations are conducted on the level of technical
experts, the ultimate decision is taken by the national
Ministers or even Heads of States. This creates a bottleneck
prone to the influence of special interest groups which are
well connected with high-level decision-makers. Moreover,
all countries have to agree to any small amendment of the
CET: Every change of individual tariff lines needs full con-
sent from all member states. Thus, CET negotiations are
characterized by a quid pro quo of national exemptions.
There are several examples for this practice. In 2014, the
CET on paper was decreased from 25% to 10% for 36 tariff
lines making inputs cheaper for converters across the region.
In 2015, the tariff on 17 iron and steel tariff lines increased
from 10% to 25% protecting local manufacturers of these
products. While these were steps toward more regional solu-
tions, countries immediately undermined the agreements.
Kenya and Tanzania continued to apply high tariffs on paper
to protect politically well-connected paper manufacturers.3
On iron and steel, all countries unilaterally derogated depend-
ing on the production profiles of their own companies
(Interview 12; Interview 16) leading to the spike in overall
derogations notable in Figure 1. Hence, derogations and
exemption are used to build consensus. Tanzania could agree
to CET reductions without ceasing to protect its politically
important paper manufacturer. Similarly, countries could
settle for the lowest common denominator like in the iron
and steel case, as they have the security of falling back to the
exemption schemes.
While derogation and the use of the DRS are a tool to
build consensus, countries need consent to use them. For
instance, in the case of paper, Tanzania could not simply
decide to continue to apply higher tariffs, but needed the con-
sensus of all other states. Theoretically, that would give the
Council of Ministers the opportunity to allow derogations
only in rare and extreme scenarios, as specified in the
Protocol. According to the EAC Secretariat (Interview 1;
Interview 9), countries have to prove that they cannot source
enough of a product at an acceptable quality and price in the
region before applying a lower tariff. However, in practice, a
form of logrolling takes place in the Council with respect to
CET decisions (Interview 2): Countries will rarely veto the
request for an exemption, as each country has several similar
demands every year. The practice of mutually accepting uni-
lateral CET derogations goes back to the negotiations of the
CU when Kenya and Tanzania gave into a last minute
demand by Uganda's president Museveni even before the
Protocol had been signed (Interview 2). Since then, it became
virtually impossible to argue against national derogations.As
there is no supranational authority on tariff-setting, the
10 SAGE Open
existing decision-making structures and accepted practices
enable the pursuit of national interests and give room to
interest groups to affect CET policies by lobbying their
national representatives on the domestic level only. Anthony
Weru (Interview 21), of the KEPSA, suggests that lobbyists
have understood that there is no need to lobby regionally
when national decision-makers have means to achieve
almost all their objectives:
Of course, EAC is intergovernmental when it comes to
discussions. Decisions are made by government officials, so you
get them at the domestic level. By the time they will be moving
to Arusha, even the ministry will be interested in protecting its
private sector.
Regional lobbying and mutual interests.The previous section
has outlined reasons why EAC Partner States manage to
push for their national preferences and use exemption
schemes. Nevertheless, harmonized CET changes have hap-
pened in several cases. As unilateral derogations could be
connected to domestic lobbying, regional solutions might be
linked to the pressure of regional interest groups. Accord-
ingly, this section discusses the final bold assertion: If
regional interest groups are actively lobbying, countries are
more likely to prioritize regional solutions leading to less
CET instability.
Most of the CET changes observed have affected manu-
factured goods like iron and steel products, paper, or cement.
Manufacturing is still in its infancy in East Africa, but some
of the larger industries have reached enough capacity to
organize on regional level. Interviewees listed the iron and
steel manufacturers, paper converters, sugar refineries, and
cement producers as being especially active on the regional
level (Interview 1; Interview 16). In 2014, the EAC decreased
the CET on raw paper products, which was popular with
paper converters. In 2015, the EAC increased the CET on a
wide range of iron and steel products. Those were the first
two incidences of a comprehensive use of CET to support
regionalinsteadofnationalindustryinterests.Representatives
of the EAC Secretariat argue that this can mainly be contrib-
uted to the regional approach of the industries:
You would not believe it, but all the [iron and steel] associations
in Partner States had the regional approach. They all told us the
same things. Even when they are not manufacturing a product
they say there is a potential and you should protect. (Interview 1)
In the case of cement, the outcome is less obvious, as the
CET did not change to the industries' favor. However, the
industries' regional lobbying efforts lead to regional debates
about CET levels on their products. The level of cement tar-
iffs was one of the most contentious debates in the CET
negotiations in 2014 and 2015 after a regionally organized
lobby effort of the industry (Interview 16). The EAC even
conducted a study that proposed an increase in cement tar-
iffs, but Partner States ultimately decided against it.
Regional lobbying uses two approaches: On one hand,
national associations have harmonized their proposals on tar-
iff levels to their respective domestic ministries. On the other
hand, the regional association works through the umbrella
lobby, the East African Business Council (EABC), which
can also submit official proposals on the CET to the negotia-
tors. All in all, every important debate about wider CET
amendments can be connected to the effort of a regional
industry lobby. This finding supports what the article already
saw on domestic level: Private sector groups can actively
influence CET levels. Yet, most industries may find it easier
or less costly to lobby domestically. The existence of the
exemption regime makes this option more likely to succeed.
Industries that managed to organize regionally tend to be
characterized by larger companies that have invested in mul-
tiple EAC countries and a concentrated number of investors
(Interview 1; Interview 16). Especially, Kenyan companies
have established subsidiaries in Tanzania and Uganda.
Roofings, Uganda's largest iron and steel company, stated
that they used to focus on domestic lobbying, but started to
cooperate with regional players after they started to invest in
neighboring countries (Interview 12). In cement, several
investors have shares in companies across the region. For
example, the French company Lafarge owns shares in all
three countries (Lafarge, 2016). Thus, being active in multi-
ple countries facilitates regional organization, but also means
that a distorted CET through derogations makes it harder to
operate across countries. Hence, a regional presence
increases a firm's preference for a stable CET and against
national exemptions.
In agriculture, regional lobby groups also exist but are
overall less involved in CET negotiations. Nonetheless, there
are fewer cases of unilateral derogations by states than in
manufacturing. While in manufacturing production profiles
differ more strongly and national interests diverge, farmers
across the region grow similar crops facilitating govern-
ments' agreement on protective tariffs.
Conclusion
Since its introduction in 2005, the EAC's CET has been
increasingly destabilized by unilateral derogations from the
CET in a wide range of strongly traded tariff lines. This
instability in the CET worries private sector and EAC repre-
sentatives alike. The article has discussed how the influence
of domestic interest groups may affect tariff negotiations and
the resulting CET instability.
Countries enter tariff negotiations with a strong domestic
focus. Governments look out for organized business groups
and other vested interests. Institutions are susceptible to spe-
cial interests, and personal networks play an important role
for the outcome of policies. Kenya especially has a well-
organized manufacturing sector that manages to align its
interests with decision-makers in government. Yet, the pref-
erences of large and well-connected industries are accounted
Bünder 11
for in the tariff negotiation positions of all countries.
Likewise, all governments seem to be interested to keep
average agricultural tariffs high to protect a large rural elec-
torate despite repeated derogations for particular sectors like
rice or sugar. Vested interests of government representatives
also reflect in tariff fluctuations.
The strong influence of domestic interest groups projects
itself to the regional level. Discussing CET levels, govern-
ments focus on securing protection for their specific local
industries rather than considering what is best for the regional
economy. Countries are willing to destabilize the CET to
secure national tariff preferences by using exemption
schemes to an extent that was never foreseen in the CU
Protocol. Unilateral derogations from the CET have become
an accepted tool to reach consensus in tariff negotiations. As
there is consensus-based decision-making in the EAC, each
country has the power to block decisions if it does not get its
will. Accordingly, countries have developed a practice of
logrolling from the start. Requests for derogations from the
CET are usually granted, no matter if the criteria are fulfilled.
Nonetheless, in some cases, regional considerations tri-
umphed over the protection of national interests. This is true
for most of the agricultural tariffs, where domestic interests
overlap and countries agree that the CET should remain high
and stable to protect farmers and serve as an incentive to
invest in the sector. In manufacturing, a harmonized approach
to tariff levels mostly occurred where industry has managed
to organize regionally and prefers a harmonized tariff over
national protectionist schemes.
Finally, future research on the EAC CET could also take
into account other explanatory factors. Interviewees raised
issues like the impact of ideology, international market
prices, or international trade negotiations on CET dynam-
ics. Yet, the results of the paper already offer an interesting
insight into the deeper integration dynamics. While lack-
ing ownership of the private sector was one of the key rea-
sons for failure of the first EAC, it now actively shapes
EAC politics. Behind all major changes in CET (e.g.,
paper, steel), the article detected evidence for proactive
lobbying of private sector groups. The future success of
the EAC CU will depend on how well the member states
and the Secretariat balance the involvement of the private
sector in the negotiations between lack of interest and
lobby capture.
