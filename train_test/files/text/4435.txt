Article
Introductory Information
In this article, the researchers present a case study of servant
leadership being practiced in a network of family-owned com-
panies in Anoka, Minnesota. The companies are owned by
Larry and Marie McNeff along with their son, Clayton McNeff.
This research was inspired by a tour of their facilities at SarTec,
an agricultural specialty products and service company. The
visit was unrelated to research but the primary researcher was
impressed with the overall atmosphere of the company and
with the work being done at SarTec in creating biodiesel using
the recently patented Mcgyan® process (www.Mcgyan.com).
In July of 2009, the primary researcher began work at Bethel
Seminary on a doctor of ministry degree in servant leadership
for team and organizational effectiveness. He was, once again,
a guest of the McNeffs. Now looking at organizations through
a servant leadership lens he observed that the McNeffs were
practicing a number of servant leadership behaviors as owners
of their companies.
Focus of the Study
The focus of the study was to identify the servant leadership
behaviors of the company owners and to discover how their
servant leadership practices have contributed to worker satis-
faction in their companies. Together the McNeffs have
formed six family-owned companies that employ 65 people.
The companies are listed in Table 1.
Family Background
Larry McNeff holds a BS degree in chemistry from the
University of Nebraska. Marie McNeff holds an EdD degree
also from the University of Nebraska. Clayton McNeff holds
a PhD from the University of Minnesota in Analytical
Chemistry. From 1967 to 1979, Larry McNeff worked for a
large company doing research and development of cattle
feed formulas. From 1979 to 1983, he worked as a marketing
representative for another company. In 1983, he started the
first family company called SarTec, which produces a cattle
feed supplement using an extract from the yucca plant. The
"Sar" in the company name comes from sarsaponin which is

Job Satisfaction and the Priority of
Valuing People: A Case Study of Servant
Leadership Practice in a Network of
Family-Owned Companies
Michael E. McNeff1 and Justin A. Irving1
Abstract
The servant leadership literature has a growing body of evidence pointing to the positive relationship between servant
leadership and job satisfaction. Because many of these studies have focused on quantitative analyses of the subject, the
present study brings a complementary qualitative perspective. This article presents the findings of a case study focused on
the servant leadership practices of the McNeff family in their network of family-owned companies in Anoka, Minnesota. Using
the six servant leadership themes developed by Laub, the study focused on interviews with the owners and survey results
from employees. The researchers found that the servant leadership practices of the owners are contributing to the job
satisfaction of the employees. In addition, the researchers found evidence to suggest that the theme of valuing people may
have a disproportionately strong effect on the culture of a business or organization, and serve as the foundation on which
other servant leadership behaviors may occur.

a group of compounds in the yucca extract. The "Tec" stands
for technology. The company has grown and now produces
several animal feed products using this technology. The
products have proven to be a natural way to reduce bloat in
cattle and horses.
Marie McNeff retired from Augsburg College in
Minneapolis in 2000 after serving for 28 years as a faculty
member and for 5 years as the dean of faculty. Immediately
after retirement, she began the service of making lunch for
all of the employees in the SarTec facility. The company has
become known for this service.
ZirChrom Separations, Inc., is a company started by
Clayton McNeff in 1995 following his PhD work at the
University of Minnesota. ZirChrom manufactures zirconia-
based high performance chromatographic materials for the
analytical analysis of compounds primarily by high perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In 2006, because of
his work in separation sciences, Clayton was invited to help in
research being conducted at Augsburg College by a student
named Brian Krohn, who was working on a project to discover
a clean way to produce biodiesel fuel. This research brought
him together with Arlin Gyberg and Ben Yan. Gyberg is a pro-
fessor of analytical chemistry at Augsburg College and was
assisting Krohn in his project. Gyberg suggested bringing
McNeff into the research because of McNeff's work in separa-
tion sciences and catalysts. Yan was working as the chief sci-
entist at SarTec. This partnership resulted in the Mcgyan®
process which converts alcohol in combination with vegetable
oil or animal tallow into biodiesel in a continuous, no waste
process (Ever Cat Fuels, 2011). This discovery led to the cre-
ation of Ever Cat Fuels LLC and Mcgyan Biodiesel LLC. In
2009, the family opened a biodiesel plant in Isanti, Minnesota,
which uses the Mcgyan process.
The primary researcher is related to the McNeffs. This
possible bias was mitigated by the inclusion of another
researcher and by the use of an anonymous survey taken by
the employees of the McNeff companies.
Literature Review
Servant leadership has established a solid foundation in the-
ory and practice. Built upon the work of Robert K. Greenleaf
(1977), individuals like Laub (1999), Page and Wong (2000),
Spears (1995), Patterson (2003), Winston (2003), and Irving
(2011) have proposed theoretical models to capture the
essence of servant leadership. For Greenleaf (2002),
The servant leader is servant first. It begins with the natural
feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious
choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply
different from the one who is leader first. (p. 27)
Greenleaf followed this with questions to test servant leader-
ship: "Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while
being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autono-
mous, more likely themselves to become servants?" (p. 27).
Such questions serve as a foundation for the present study.
The researchers in this study were interested in observing the
impact of servant leadership on the employees of a network
of family-owned companies. Because of this, the theme of
servant leadership's impact on job satisfaction is of particu-
lar interest to the researchers.
Laub (2004) defines servant leadership as "an understand-
ing and practice of leadership that places the good of those
led over the self-interest of the leader" (p. 81). This emphasis
on "the good of those led" is what sets servant leadership
apart from other leadership models, and serves as a founda-
tion for theoretical connections between servant leadership
and variables like follower commitment, leader trust, organi-
zational trust, and job satisfaction.
On such connections, we note the following key argu-
ments from the literature.
Patterson (2003) presented a theoretical model that pre-
dicted servant leadership would produce a higher level of
service by the followers. Winston (2003) extended the work
of Patterson by predicting that servant leadership will not
only result in greater service by the followers, but will also
result in greater commitment to the leader by the followers.
Errol and Winston (2005) found that perceptions of servant
leadership correlated positively with both leader trust and
organizational trust and that organizations perceived as ser-
vant-led exhibited higher levels of both leader trust and
organizational trust than organizations perceived as nonser-
vant-led. In an important cross-cultural study, West and
Bocarnea (2008) found that the servant leadership constructs
of service, humility, and vision contributed to organizational
commitment and job satisfaction in American and Filipino
settings.
The servant leadership literature has a growing body of
evidence pointing to the positive relationship between ser-
vant leadership and job satisfaction. Laub (1999) pointed to
this relationship in the development of the Organizational
Leadership Assessment. Irving identified a positive relation-
ship between these variables in his study in the nonprofit sec-
tor (Irving, 2005), and in his study across multiple sectors
(Irving, 2004). Hebert (2004) found a positive relationship
between servant leadership and job satisfaction in her study

of 12 organizations from both the public and private sectors.
Amadeo (2008) found this relationship in the health care

Thompson (2002), Miears (2004), Anderson (2005), Van
Tassell (2006), and Svoboda (2008) all found positive rela-
tionships between servant leadership and job satisfaction in
the education sector. And Drury (2004) and Chu (2008)
found this positive relationship within the business sector,
with Drury focused in manufacturing and Chu focused within
a call center setting.
The present study expands this literature stream focused
on the relationship between servant leadership and job satis-
faction. Because all of the above noted studies have focused
on quantitative analyses of the relationship between servant
leadership and job satisfaction, the present study brings a
complementary qualitative perspective on this relationship,
and does so within a network of family own companies. As
the positive relationship between servant leadership and job
satisfaction has been confirmed in many previous studies,
the researchers in this study found it helpful to expand the
literature stream focused on this relationship by looking at
the qualitative dimensions to this positive relationship.
Method
This study focused on identifying servant leadership prac-
tices of the McNeff family in their network of companies in
Anoka, Minnesota. Through personal interviews with the
owners and survey data collected from organizational
employees, an approach of theoretical coding was used to
identify servant leadership practice in the McNeff companies
around Laub's (1999) six servant leadership behaviors.
Data Collection
The data were collected by personal interviews with the
owners, and by inviting organizational employees to a URL
containing a web-based survey. The web-based survey was
available for all employees in the organization beyond the
owners, and a total of 10 employees responded. Utilizing this
web-based format allowed for an electronically mediated
collection of the research data, and helped to provide both a
convenient and anonymous method through which employ-
ees could respond. Table 2 lists the survey questions focused
on Laub's (1999) servant leadership behaviors.
Data Analysis
The primary researcher approached the data obtained through
the interview from a narrative inquiry perspective (Clandinin
& Connelly, 2000; Polkinghorne, 1988). The primary
researcher adopted this style of research because narrative
theory is relational and admits to the phenomena of the
researcher moving from emotional involvement with the
subjects of the research to "slipping to cool observation"
(Clandinin & Connelly, 2000, p. 81). As a family member,
the primary researcher was fully involved emotionally with
the McNeffs. Through the interview transcript and through a
1-year time gap between the interview and writing, he was
able achieve a degree of objectivity. Additional objectivity
was gained by the inclusion of a second researcher who has
no relationship to the McNeff family. Polkinghorne observes,
"Narrative creates its meaning by noting the contributions
that actions and events make to a particular outcome and
then configures these parts into a whole episode" (p. 6). In
processing the interview experience, the primary researcher
was looking for actions and events (the parts) that contrib-
uted to the servant leadership behavior he was observing (the
whole). The researchers utilized theoretical coding of the
interview data to determine what authentic themes were
emerging that related to Laub's (1999) six servant leadership
behaviors of valuing people, developing people, creating
community, providing leadership, sharing leadership, and
displaying authenticity.
The second source of data was obtained from the online
survey completed by the employees of the McNeff compa-
nies. This provided another needed objective point of view
for the research process. The primary researcher felt he was
observing servant leadership in action on the part of the
McNeffs. The survey would provide a triangulated data
source to help confirm or refute the observations of the pri-
mary researcher. Furthermore, the responses to the survey

satisfaction and would provide qualitative data related to the
connection of the servant leadership being practiced by the
company owners and the job satisfaction being experienced
by the employees. Theoretical coding was also used for the
analysis of the survey data.
Findings
Servant Leadership Themes
The primary researcher used Laub's six servant leadership
behaviors to provide a framework for identifying servant
leadership behaviors in the interview transcript. Laub's first
servant leadership behavior is "valuing people." One of the
reasons Larry McNeff left a large company to start his own
company was because he felt that employees were not treated
well. He said that he would see people get "tossed out just for
the convenience of the company." He determined that when
he started his own company, he would give people "more
freedoms than they could have at a big company." Toward
the end of the interview, Larry said,
Having a culture where you can treat people like a family is
important. It makes it very difficult to part ways with family
members. Occasionally we do have to part ways with an
employee and that's not easy. And it shouldn't be easy. If it's an
easy thing something is way wrong and most likely it's
something wrong with management.
The McNeffs have been very successful in creating com-
munity in their companies. Marie McNeff makes lunches
every day for the 45 employees who work at the SarTec facil-
ity. Despite having been dean of faculty at Augsburg College
she does not consider cooking for people a "menial" task.
Rather she feels it is "one of the most important things you
can do for people." This practice has also served to build
community within the company as the employees sit around
a table daily with one another. Clayton added that this prac-
tice sets them apart. He said, "We've gotten a lot of mileage
out of it. There's almost like a folklore now about it." He
then related a story about a local newscaster who came to the
SarTec facility to interview the founders of the Mcgyan pro-
cess. When the reporter stepped out of his car the first thing
he said was, "Is this where the good meals are?"
The McNeffs articulated the importance of developing
people. Clayton McNeff remembers being included in family
business decisions at the age of 13 years. He said that he felt
empowered by his parents throughout his childhood and
early teens. He credits his mother who had an educational
philosophy of finding the strengths of students and then
allowing them to work in their areas of strength. Clayton felt
that his mother practiced this value with him. Clayton also
remembers being included and empowered by his father
when the family started the SarTec company. Clayton defi-
nitely feels he benefited from the development efforts of his
parents. This value of developing people has been continued
by the McNeffs in their companies. They have established a
policy of paying for the educational development of their
employees. Larry stated, "Our company pays for employee
educational improvement."
Providing leadership is another of Laub's servant leader-
ship behaviors. One of the ways the McNeffs demonstrate
this is through their insistence in product quality. When Larry
McNeff started SarTec, one of his negative experiences with
a larger company was that they were creating a cattle feed
product that was actually hurting cattle. He said, "The [prod-
uct] they were selling, the animals would over consume and
they would croak!"As a result, when he started his own com-
pany it was important to make a product that the company
could stand behind. When discussing company values he
added,
[It was a value] to develop something that was worthwhile. To
try to make the best product I could in the field that we're in.
And I think I did that. So we had something we could really get
behind.
Also related to providing leadership, Clayton McNeff
described the value of modeling the behaviors that the own-
ers desired from the employees. He also emphasized the
leadership quality of teaching and encouraging problem
solving on the part of the employees. Noting that several of
their employees had come from larger companies where the
culture discouraged independent thinking on the part of
employees, Clayton gave examples of how the McNeffs
encourage independent thinking to solve problems encoun-
tered by the employees on a day-to-day basis.
The McNeffs practice sharing leadership, which is another
of Laub's servant leadership behaviors. Clayton talked about
the importance of listening to employees and allowing their
ideas to have the same weight as those of the owners. He
said, "You don't always [have to] think that you're the per-
son in the room who knows everything. [The] best ideas
always go on the table and it doesn't matter where they come
from."
Displaying authenticity is the final servant leadership
behavior from Laub. In describing the importance of consis-
tency Clayton McNeff observed, "You have to let your
actions speak louder than your words." Larry McNeff said,
"if you listen to your employees, they'll tell you what they
think and you have to invite that and they'll be honest with
you. You gotta know what they actually think." Larry also
said, "Big companies are full of loopers and log rollers who
don't want the other person to succeed." When asked by the
interviewer what loopers and log rollers are Larry said,
A looper is a person who doesn't come straight with information
or even a question but rather "loops" his or her way to you. A log
roller is someone who doesn't want the guy over there to have
the advantage so he rolls a few logs to kill a good idea of another
person by questioning it to death.
McNeff and Irving 5
Very often the coding of the interview revealed two or
more of Laub's servant leadership behaviors in combination
with one another. For example, one of the statements in the
interview was, "You don't always think that you're the per-
son in the room who knows everything. The best ideas
always go on the table and it doesn't matter where they come
from." This statement reveals a combination of valuing peo-
ple, and practicing authenticity. When there were combina-
tions like this, the servant leadership behavior of valuing
people appeared more often than any other servant leader-
ship behavior. In fact, seven of the 15 occurrences of valuing
people appeared in combination with another theme. It
appeared 3 times in combination with developing people, 3
times in combination with building community, and once in
combination with displaying authenticity.
Table 3 lists Laub's (1999) six servant leadership behav-
iors and the number of times each behavior was identified in
the interview coding. The behaviors are listed in descending
order of their occurrence in the interview.
Antecedents of Servant Leadership Practice From
the Histories of the McNeffs
The interview revealed several contributing factors to Larry
and Marie McNeff becoming servant leaders. First were their
supportive family backgrounds that valued individuals and
encouraged achievement. Next was Larry McNeff's negative
experience working with a large food production company.
He was displeased with the lack of empowerment given to
workers and the lack of general care given to workers who
encountered problems in their lives. He determined, upon
starting his company, that his treatment of employees would
reflect the value of human beings. The next factor was Marie
McNeff's experience as an educator who approached her
role with a personal value of empowerment for students.
They also credited their servant leader attitudes to their
Christian faith.
Clayton McNeff's path to servant leadership was largely a
result of growing up in a home where he was encouraged to
participate in making decisions about the family business
when he was only 12 years old. As a child and teenager, he
was influenced and empowered by his mother who
approached his development as she would that of a student.
Another contributing factor was the chance he had to take a
business trip with his father and seeing how his father treated
others. He also was watching how his parents valued their
employees. One of the ways they show this is through the
lunches that Marie prepares every day. This willingness and
even eagerness to serve her family and her employees had a
great impact on Clayton.
Evidence of Servant Leadership Practices in the
Businesses
The employees of the McNeff's companies validated the
presence of all of Laub's servant leadership behaviors in
their survey responses. Below are the survey questions with
some representative comments from the employees.
Question 1 (Valuing People): In what ways do the own-
ers demonstrate that they value employees?
·
· "They never make you feel less, they take interest in
you and your family as people not just as an asset.
They make decisions for the company with their
employee's best interest in mind--not just the bottom
line."
·
· "I have always been treated with great respect and
always felt that my work was greatly valued."
·
· "The McNeff's treat employees like valued family
members. This includes providing free lunches and
paid health insurance benefits."
·
· "Owners show their employees that they are needed,
and praise them for a job well done."
·
· "Everyone is treated with respect."
Question 2 (Developing People): How do the owners
develop people within this organization?
·
· "Opportunities for growth and change are distributed
within the organization."
·
· "Tuition reimbursement."
·
· "Management will provide guidance and support in
order to encourage leadership development. Almost all
promotions come from within the existing employee
ranks."
·
· "They find employees strengths and assign job respon-
sibilities accordingly."
·
· "Scheduled performance appraisals."
Question 3 (Building Community): How have the own-
ers built a sense of community within this organization?
·
· "Annual Christmas party."
·
· "Birthday recognition."
·
· "By providing lunch every day. By always being
available."
·
· "Cultural celebrations like Chinese New Year."

Question 4 (Displaying Authenticity): How do the own-
ers of this company display authenticity (open and account-
able, willingness to learn, demonstrating honesty and
integrity)?
·
· "They value all suggestions for improvements and
encourage each employee to provide suggestions.
They deal honestly with all their employees."
·
· "Customers know if SarTec commits to a program or
plan of action they can plan on that commitment going
forward."
·
· "The owners are friendly and have made themselves
approachable."
Question 5 (Providing Leadership): How do the owners
of this company provide leadership for you and the
organization?
·
· "They continue to innovate and provide interesting
new challenges for their employees."
·
· "Implementations of employee's suggestions for
improvement fosters an environment where employ-
ees feel that it is their company."
·
· "Leading by example."
·
· "To show an inspiring vision of the organization's
future."
·
· "SarTec management is very accessible and encour-
ages communication with employees. As a result
employee turnover rate is very low."
·
· "Constant communication from top to bottom of
organization."
Question 6 (Sharing Leadership): In what ways do the
owners of this company share leadership?
·
· "They put a lot of trust in their employees. They dele-
gate tasks and trust that the tasks will be completed."
·
· "Once an objective or goal is established the owners
and employees tasked with completing the assign-
ment share in the leadership role in order to bring the
assignment to a successful conclusion."
·
· "[By] developing a culture of collaboration rather
than command and control where change is welcomed
as an opportunity rather than a threat."
Question 7: What additional thoughts would you like to
share about your experience in this company and the
owners?
·
· "SarTec has a great organization in terms of manage-
ment and employee staff. Everyone seems to get along.
Morale is high. Good place to work."
·
· "They are generous people and great to work for."
·
· "I think the numbers speak for themselves. Nobody
ever leaves this company."
Discussion
These findings revealed that there is great consistency
between the owners' and employees' perspectives of the
company. The employees' responses combined with the
interview data showed that the values verbalized by the own-
ers are validated by the employees' experience in the com-
pany. The responses of the employees confirm that servant
leadership was being practiced by the owners and experi-
enced by the employees. The responses also confirmed that
the employees who responded to the survey were experienc-
ing job satisfaction. This links, in the experience of these
employees, employee job satisfaction with the servant lead-
ership practices of the owners. This finding is consistent with
previous studies linking servant leadership to job satisfaction
(Hebert, 2004; Irving, 2004; Irving, 2005; Laub, 1999;
Mayer, Bardes, & Piccolo, 2008). Furthermore, Rath and
Conchie (2008) identified trust, compassion, stability, and
hope to be the greatest needs of followers that, when ade-
quately met, contribute to their job satisfaction. Participant
response previously noted supports the presence of such ser-
vant leadership.
This study also revealed the possibility that the presence of
valuing people is what drives the servant leadership of the
company owners. This emphasis on valuing people had the
most occurrences in the interview data and was also very well
represented in the survey data. These findings indicate the pos-
sibility that the theme of valuing people serves as a baseline
for the presence of the other servant leadership behaviors. On
the importance of valuing people, Laub (2011) argues,
Healthy organizations have a different view of people. People
are to be valued and developed, not used . . . Leaders accept the
fact that people have present value not just future potential.
People seem to have an innate ability to know whether or not
they are being valued . . . whether or not they are trusted.
Effective leaders accept a person's value up front. They give
them the gift of trust without requiring that they earn it first. As
leaders work with people in organizations they will serve them
by displaying the qualities of valuing people.
Based on such a perspective, it is not difficult to see why
valuing people may have a disproportionately strong effect
on the culture of a business or organization, and serve as the
foundation on which other servant leadership behaviors may
occur.
This study also found that the servant leadership behav-
iors of the owners were developed over time through family,
experience, training, and religious faith. Larry's servant
leadership behavior emerged through his family of origin,
his faith, and the negative experiences he had in a large
company that seemed to devalue the importance of individ-
uals. Marie's servant leadership behaviors flowed from her
family of origin, her faith, and her educational training and
experience. Clayton's servant leadership emerged from his
relationship with his parents, especially their empowerment
McNeff and Irving 7
of him in his developing years, his faith, and his own busi-
ness experience.
Study Strengths and Limitations
This study provides significant support for other findings
that have shown servant leadership is connected to employee
satisfaction. The scope of this research was limited by the
number of employees who responded to the survey. This also
translates into exercising caution when generalizing the find-
ings beyond the individual participants in the study. Because
the primary researcher is related to some of the subjects of
the research, there is a possibility of bias. This possibility
was recognized by the researchers and was moderated by the
inclusion of the online survey to gather data from the employ-
ees. In addition, the inclusion of a second researcher who has
no relationship with the McNeff family also served to address
the potential issue of researcher bias in the study. The anony-
mous nature of the survey allowed the employees to answer
freely without fear of identification. The final question of the
survey invited general responses from the employees.
Recommendations for Future Research
The present study suggests the possibility that the valuing
people is a baseline for the existence of the other servant
leadership behaviors. In light of this, future studies examin-
ing the relationship of valuing people to other servant leader-
ship behaviors are in order. In addition, the positive impact
of servant leadership on job satisfaction was evidenced in a
qualitative way in this study. Because of the extensive evi-
dence of this positive correlation in the quantitative litera-
ture, it would be helpful to have additional qualitative studies
providing rich description of this observation in a variety of
organizational sectors. In addition, because the sample size
in this qualitative study was limited, future studies that
engage a larger number of participants would help with logi-
cal generalizations of the findings. Finally, family, faith,
experience, and training all contributed to the servant leader-
ship practice of the company owners with the family being
the primary place in the lives of the owners where servant
leadership was modeled, nurtured, and learned. This research
invites future studies of the role of family relationships in the
development of servant leaders.
Summary
This research project focused on servant leadership practice
in a network of family-owned companies. Special attention
was given to the connection between servant leadership prac-
tice and employee job satisfaction, and provided qualitative
evidence of servant leadership's positive impact on employee
job satisfaction. In addition, the priority of valuing people
was observed to play a disproportionately significant role in
the development of an overall servant-oriented culture. Thus,
we argue that the behavior of valuing people is a founda-
tional servant leadership commitment that serves as a base-
line for other servant leadership behaviors focused on the
good of the led over the self-interest of the leader.
