Benefits of and Barriers to Large
Medical Group Practice in the United States

Many of the difficulties in present medical practice can be overcome, wholly or in part, by group organization. . . . Some of these
difficulties are: lack of coordination . . . lack of adequate supervision and control over the quality of medical care . . . the difficulty
experienced by patients in choosing qualified physicians; the unnecessarily large expenditure for overhead costs made by practitioners
in individual private practice; and the increasing complexity of medical service.
Committee on the Costs of Medical Care1
Background: For decades, reformers argued that medi-
cal groups can efficiently provide high-quality care and
a collegial professional environment. The growth of man-
aged care and the movement to improve quality provide
additional reasons for physicians to practice in groups,
especially large groups. However, information is lack-
ing on recent trends in group size and the benefits of and
barriers to group practice.
Objectives: To identify benefits of and barriers to large
medical group practice, and to describe recent trends in
group size.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Information on
benefits and barriers was obtained from 195 interviews
conducted during round 3 (2000-2001) of the Commu-
nity Tracking Study with leaders of the largest groups,
hospitals, and health insurance plans in 12 randomly se-
lected metropolitan areas. Information on recent trends
in group size was obtained from more than 6000 physi-
cians in private practice in 48 randomly selected metro-
politan areas via Community Tracking Study telephone
surveys in 1997-1998, 1998-1999, and 2000-2001.
Main Outcome Measures: Benefits of and barriers to
large group practice, as perceived by interviewees, and
changes in percentages of physicians in groups of vary-
ing sizes.
Results: Gaining negotiating leverage with health in-
surance plans was the most frequently cited benefit; it
was cited 8 times more often than improving quality. Lack
of physician cooperation, investment, and leadership were
the most frequently cited barriers. Survey data indicate
that 47% of private physicians work in practices of 1 or
2 physicians and 82% in practices of 9 or fewer, and that
the percentage of physicians in groups of 20 or more did
not increase between 1996 and 2001.
Conclusions: Current payment methods reward gain-
ing size to obtain negotiating leverage more than they re-
ward quality. However, barriers to creating large medi-
cal groups are substantial, and most private physicians
continue to practice in small groups, although the size
of these groups is slowly increasing.

DURING THE 7decadessince
the committee's 1932 re-
port,medicalreformers--
including physician
leaders in groups like the
Mayo Clinic,2 Palo Alto Medical Clinic,3
Scripps Clinic,4 and Permanente Medical
Group (Kaiser)5--have argued that group
practice, especially large multispecialty
group practice, can improve the quality of
health care, decrease costs, and provide
a professionally desirable working envi-
ronment for physicians6-11 (Table 1).
As medical care has become increasingly
complex and expensive, and as awareness
of medical errors12 and the possibilities
for using organized processes to improve
quality have grown,13 the problems iden-
tified by the committee have become
more salient than ever. Furthermore, the
growth of managed care appeared to cre-
ate new reasons for physicians to practice
in groups, especially large groups14-17
(Table 1).
Despite their potential importance,
relatively little is known about medical
groups, perhaps because they are more dif-
ficult to study than health insurance plans
(hereafter referred to as health plans) or
hospitals. Groups are much more numer-
ous, and standard data on them are scarce.
The limited data available on their perfor-
mance, although far from conclusive,18-21
suggest that groups have the potential to

ciently,23-26 contain medical care costs,27-30

tential does not appear to be fulfilled in many cases.29,33-35
Furthermore, although the number of physicians in
groups has been growing for decades, in 1996, 65% of
private practice physicians worked in practices of 4 or
fewer physicians, and 39% practiced solo.36
Although there are many potential advantages of
medical groups, and although the degree to which phy-
sician practice is organized may be important to pa-
tients, purchasers, health plans, policy makers, and phy-
sicians, no systematic knowledge exists of the benefits
of and barriers to group practice in the United States. Also,
it is unknown whether the prevalence of large medical
groups has increased since 1996 in response to man-
aged care. We present, to our knowledge, the first na-
tionally representative data on the benefits of and barri-
ers to large medical group practice and on recent trends
in the prevalence of groups of different sizes.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLE, AND
DATA COLLECTION
We used information from the site visit and survey components
of the Community Tracking Study (CTS).37,38
Since 1996, the CTS has conducted 3 rounds of site vis-
its, involving 1690 interviews, to the same 12 randomly se-
lected US metropolitan areas. We focus on 195 interviews con-
ducted during round 3 (June 2000 to March 2001) with leaders
of the 3 or 4 largest physician groups, hospitals, and health plans
in each area. Interviewees included medical directors, chief
executive and operating officers, and executives responsible
for contracting and network formation. These interviewees
were well positioned to know what was happening with
groups in their area and had differing perspectives from which
to offer perceptions of the benefits of and barriers to group
practice.
Interviews were conducted by 19 interviewers organized
into 4 teams. Each team visited 3 metropolitan areas. Inter-
viewers included university faculty and CTS researchers who
frequently worked in pairs to facilitate note taking. Interviews
lasted 60 to 90 minutes and were based on protocols that in-
cluded open-ended questions followed by specific probes. Af-
ter each interview, interviewers compared notes; the lead in-
terviewer then typed the notes, which were entered into the
qualitative analysis software program Atlas.ti.39,40
We defined medical groups as 3 or more physicians for-
mally organized as a legal entity in which business, clinical, and
administrative facilities are shared.41 We explained to inter-
viewees that we were primarily interested in large medical
groups. Since no standard definition of such groups exists, we
asked interviewees to indicate what size they considered such
groups to be. Most considered multispecialty groups of ap-
proximately 10 to 20 physicians to be of moderate size and those
of greater than 20 to be large; somewhat smaller numbers were
given for single-specialty groups.
We chose a qualitative study design to explore the ben-
efits of and barriers to group practice for 3 reasons. First, little
is known about this subject. Qualitative research is particu-
larly useful for developing an understanding of new subjects
and for generating hypotheses.42-44 Second, many of the fac-
tors that may affect medical groups (eg, managed care) are chang-
ing rapidly, making the perceptions of experienced leaders "on
the ground" essential for understanding what is happening.
Third, many factors (eg, the role of physician leadership in group
practice) may be multifaceted, difficult to quantify, and best
understood within the historical and organizational context that
interviews can provide.45
We obtained data on the percentage of physicians in groups
of varying sizes from 3 biannual telephone surveys conducted
by the CTS beginning in August 199646-49; each included in-
terviews with a nationally representative sample of greater than
12000 nonfederal patient care physicians. Response rates ranged
from 60% to 65%. In this analysis, we limited the sample to
the approximately 6000 physicians in each round who were
in private practice and situated in 48 randomly selected met-
ropolitan areas with a population of at least 200000. Physi-
cians employed by hospitals, health maintenance organiza-
tions (HMOs), academic medical centers, or governments were
excluded. The 48 areas include the 12 in which site-visit in-
terviews on barriers and benefits were conducted; results of the
analysis did not differ between the 48 and 12 sites.
DATA ANALYSIS
During and after the visit to each area, the site team met to dis-
cuss the issues identified. The team leader then wrote a de-
tailed summary, and other members wrote reports on the fol-
lowing 4 subject areas: physicians and hospitals, health plans,
employers, and the policy environment. Reports were re-
viewed by team members and revised. All 4 teams met peri-
odically to discuss findings across the 12 metropolitan areas.
Teams used triangulation, a qualitative analysis technique based
on the assumption that the credibility of results is increased if
multiple interviewees from competing organizations--in this
case, physician groups, health plans, and hospitals--present
what multiple interviewers with varying beliefs and back-
grounds record as consistent accounts.50,51 The longitudinal,
large-scale, nationally representative design of the CTS pro-
vides a strong opportunity for triangulation.
Round 3 protocols included questions about change over
time. We used responses to these questions and information
gathered during the first 2 rounds of the CTS to understand
interviewees' perceptions of trends in group formation. In ad-
dition, we searched the Atlas.ti database to produce counts of
the number of times specific benefits of and barriers to group
practice were stated by interviewees. This database includes

44186 text passages coded by CTS researchers. Since nearly
all comments about benefits and barriers were given in re-
sponse to general questions rather than specific probes, we com-
bined both types of response. Since interviewees rarely stated
that a particular benefit or barrier was not important, we re-
port only the number of positive responses.
Physicians in the survey reported on the number of phy-
sicians in their practice and were divided into 6 practice size
categories for this analysis. All survey estimates were
weighted to be representative of nonfederal physicians pro-
viding patient care in metropolitan areas with at least 200000
people; the weights account for the sample design and survey
nonresponse. Two-tailed z tests were performed to determine
whether statistically significant change occurred between
rounds.
RESULTS
TRENDS IN GROUP PRACTICE (1996-2001)
During round 1 of the CTS (May 1996 to April 1997),
interviewees in all 12 areas expected both enrollment in
HMOs with relatively narrow physician networks and risk
contracting to increase. They anticipated that physi-
cians would create primary care­based, multispecialty
medical groups large enough to gain negotiating lever-
age with HMOs and to spread the financial risk of risk
contracting.35 However, by round 2 (June 1998 to Feb-
ruary 1999), it was becoming apparent that HMOs and
risk contracting were not growing as anticipated and that
many groups were experiencing financial problems.52
By round 3 (June 2000 to March 2001), attempts
to create large multispecialty groups had ceased at all 12
sites, as groups' continued financial problems plus the
growing backlash against managed care led HMOs to pull
back from narrow provider networks and risk contract-
ing.53 Many interviewees stated, however, that single-
specialty groups, mainly in the range of 5 to 20 physi-
cians, were growing. For organizations engaging in risk
contracting, specialists are cost centers, to be used as little
as possible, but in a fee-for-service environment they be-
come major sources of revenue, particularly if they work
in well-reimbursed procedural specialties like orthope-
dics and cardiology.54 Furthermore, interviewees be-
lieved that relatively small single-specialty groups can gain
negotiating leverage with health plans while avoiding the
coordination problems and conflicts between primary care
and specialties in multispecialty groups. This was em-
phasized by the chief executive officer of a multispe-
cialty group in Boston, Mass, who stated, "Specialists
should ask themselves 1, 2, 3 times why they would join
a multispecialty group when they can reap more ben-
efits from a single-specialty group."
Consistent with interviewee perceptions about large
groups, the survey data suggest that the percentage of phy-
sicians in groups of 20 to 49, 50 to 99, and 100 or more
practitioners increased slightly between rounds 1 and 2,
but decreased slightly between rounds 2 and 3. Although
only the increased number of physicians in groups of 20
to 49 between rounds 1 and 2 was statistically significant,
the pattern across all 3 rounds, in all 3 large-group cat-
egories, is consistent with interviewee perceptions
(Table 2). In addition, the survey data indicate that many
physicians--47.0% in round 3--continue to practice solo
or with one other physician, but that this percentage de-
creased significantly from 54.0% in round 1, whereas the
number of physicians in groups of 3 to 9 (34.9%) and 10
to 19 (8.5%) increased significantly (Table 2).
INTERVIEWEES' ASSESSMENT OF LARGE
MEDICAL GROUP PRACTICE
Interviewees most frequently identified 6 benefits of and
7 barriers to group practice. Table 3 and Table 4, which
show the frequency with which each benefit and barrier
were cited by the 3 types of interviewee, should be read
with care. Because the interview protocols for physician
group interviewees focused more attention on groups than
did the protocols for health insurance plan or hospital
interviewees, the latter discussed benefits of and barri-
ers to group practice less often. Therefore, interpreta-
tion of the results in the columns of these tables should
be based on the rank order, rather than the overall preva-
lence, of responses. So Table 3, for example, should be
read as indicating that interviewees from groups, health
plans, and hospitals all cited gaining leverage with health
plans far more frequently than any other benefit, rather
than as indicating that interviewees from groups consid-
ered this more important than interviewees from health
plans or hospitals.
Gaining economies of scale, especially in purchas-
ing, management, and information systems, was the sec-
ond most frequently cited benefit. Although many inter-
viewees were aware of studies from the era before managed
care that suggested that groups achieved maximum scale

economies at 5 to 7 physicians,55-57 they argued that con-
temporary requirements for information systems and
skilled managers have increased the scale at which econo-
mies can be achieved. As a specialty group administra-
tor in Syracuse, NY, stated, "You just can't be a mom-
and-pop corner store anymore in medicine. There are too
many administrative issues to deal with; you need qual-
ity administrative staff that only a large group can pro-
vide."
Gaining leverage with hospitals was the third most
frequently cited benefit. Hospital interviewees in par-
ticular focused on this and on the related, fourth most
frequently cited benefit, ie, the potential of groups, es-
pecially single specialty groups, to profit from ancillary
services, particularly by operating outpatient diagnostic
and surgery centers in competition or as joint ventures
with hospitals.
Lifestyle (eg, collegiality and call and vacation cov-
erage) was the next most frequently cited benefit. Im-
proving quality was cited least frequently, at 8 times less
often than gaining leverage with health plans. Physician
group interviewees mentioned quality more often than
plan or hospital interviewees, but far less often than they
mentioned any other reason for forming groups. Many
interviewees criticized groups for their lack of emphasis
on quality. A health plan chief executive officer in Indi-
ana argued that "Groups have worked in terms of nego-
tiating leverage, but most have not done much for qual-
ity--nor have they been expected to by their constituent
physicians." An Indiana plan medical director, a strong
proponent of the potential of groups, stated, "I'm disap-
pointed that the movement toward groups has not been
accompanied by an emphasis on care management and
quality. They are just interested in economics." Inter-
viewees such as a hospital executive in Phoenix, Ariz, fre-
quently pointed out, however, that rewards for groups
for improving quality are scarce: "The benefits of coor-
dinated care are not sufficiently appreciated or valued in
the market."
Physicians' desire for autonomy and difficulty in co-
operating with each other was the most frequently cited
barrier to groups (Table 4). A group medical director in
Miami, Fla, explained, "Physicians are trained to make
independent decisions in the middle of the night. It's hard
to get them to work together." Lack of capital and infor-
mation systems and the reluctance of physicians to in-
vest in their group was next most frequently cited, and
was the most frequently cited barrier by hospital execu-
tives, as a Cleveland, Ohio, hospital executive for phy-
sician integration stated, "Physicians don't invest in their
practices to make them successful in the long run--
instead, they just take all the money out."
Lack of physician leadership was the third most fre-
quently cited barrier. Interviewees attributed this lack to
a paucity of physicians with management skills and to
physicians' reluctance to reward leaders who put time into
creating a group and/or helping it operate efficiently. "The
lack of physician leadership is a problem," stated a group
medical director in Phoenix, and "It's difficult to find
someone willing to step up to the plate and put in un-
compensated time." "Physicians don't think that admin-
istrative work is worth much," said another group medi-
cal director in Phoenix; the physician founder of a group
in Miami stated that "It's impossible to deal with doc-

tors. I tried to put together a quality improvement pro-
gram in our group, but it never happened. No physician
was paid to run the organization. Meetings were a night-
mare. I did so much for free, and all I got for it was a lot
of flack."
The failure of groups to manage the costs of care for
capitated patients and the added cost generated by regu-
latory mandates such as laws defining minimum hospi-
tal lengths of stay for obstetric patients were also cited
as barriers. Health plan interviewees focused on the dif-
ficulties groups had managing the costs of care, whereas
group interviewees, particularly in California, where
shared risk contracting and regulatory mandates are very
prevalent,58 focused on mandates. Fourteen of the 26 in-
terviewees who cited this as a barrier were from Orange
County, California; of these, 9 were from physician groups
(data not shown).
News of financial difficulties of other groups, lo-
cally and nationally, and problems with conflict be-
tween primary care physicians and specialists about in-
come distribution were also cited as barriers.
Triangulation of interviewee perceptions was quite
strong. First, the rank order of interviewees' percep-
tions of benefits and barriers was consistent across in-
terviewee type, with the exceptions noted above. Sec-
ond, the rank order of perceptions of benefits and barriers
was also consistent across metropolitan areas, with the
following exception (data not shown): As described, Or-
ange County interviewees were more likely to mention
regulatory mandates, the costs of taking capitation for
services (notably pharmaceuticals) not being ad-
equately under physician control, and the low health in-
surance premiums and correspondingly low capitation
rates paid to groups in California. Third, perceptions were
generally consistent between interviewees in the 4 met-
ropolitan areas (Indianapolis, Ind; Seattle, Wash; Cleve-
land; and Orange County) with the highest percentage
of physicians in groups in the 3 largest size categories
(11.5% in groups of 20-49, 50-99, and 100; mean,
16.2%) and the 4 areas (Greenville, NC; Syracuse; New-
ark, NJ; and Miami) with fewest physicians (5.6%; mean,
4.9%) in such groups (data not shown). There were only
2 exceptions. A better lifestyle was the second most fre-
quently mentioned benefit, and news of failures of other
groups was the second most frequently mentioned bar-
rier by interviewees in areas with relatively few physi-
cians in large groups, but were least frequently cited by
interviewees in areas with relatively more physicians in
large groups. Interviewees in sites with fewer large groups
may be relatively more focused on the lifestyle advan-
tages that even small groups can offer.
COMMENT
Most of the benefits traditionally thought to be pro-
vided by groups--economies of scale, profit from ancil-
lary services, and a better lifestyle--were cited by inter-
viewees. By far the most frequently cited benefit,
however--gaining negotiating leverage with health
plans--is new, ie, a creation of managed care. Accord-
ing to interviewees, however, groups do not have much
incentive to improve quality. Although many inter-
viewees expressed reservations about the performance of
groups at present, some argued that only groups of at least
moderate size, rather than physicians in solo or very small
practices, have the ability to create organized processes
to proactively improve care. Furthermore, with the ex-
ception of a few specialties (eg, cardiac surgery, in which
the same procedure is performed repeatedly), they ar-
gued that only groups can serve as units of analysis for
which statistically reliable and valid measurements of qual-
ity can be made.59 According to a physician group ad-
ministrator in Seattle, "Groups can better monitor clini-
cal performance and implement clinical protocols. As
demands for accountability in health care increase, so too
will the pressures for physicians to join groups." How-
ever, as long as purchasers and health plans fail to pro-
vide rewards for quality and emphasize relative negoti-
ating strength vs physicians as a method for determining
the level of physician payment, interviewees did not an-
ticipate that groups will focus on quality improve-
ment.60-62
Interviewees critically described physicians' lack of
cooperation, lack of investment in their groups, and lack
of support for leadership as barriers. Complementary or
alternative explanations exist for the lack of increase in
large groups: ie, many physicians may prefer a solo prac-
tice or small-group lifestyle, many patients may prefer
this setting,63-65 and/or larger groups may fail to provide
the benefits claimed for them. The increasing preva-
lence of small (3-9) and moderate-sized (10-19) groups
is consistent with this explanation, as is the small, sta-
tistically insignificant decline in the percentage of phy-
sicians in all 3 categories of large groups between rounds
2 and 3. However, it is also possible that larger groups
provide more benefits, but that collective-action prob-
lems66 limit the number of physicians willing to assume
the leadership role necessary to create and maintain such
groups. A medical group may benefit its physicians and
its patients, but if physicians are unwilling to compen-
sate leaders, the costs of creating and operating the group
would be paid mainly by the leaders, whereas all physi-
cians in the group benefit. In this case, relatively few lead-
ers and groups are likely to appear.
Interviewees stated that risk contracting made mul-
tispecialty groups more likely to form, but that fee-for-
service contracting increased the incentive to form single-
specialty groups to gain the economies of scale to invest
in and profit from ancillary services, often in competi-
tion with hospitals. Single-specialty groups were also de-
scribed as able to gain negotiating leverage with health
plans at sizes smaller than multispecialty groups, while
avoiding conflict between primary care and specialties
over income distribution.
Our study has several limitations. First, we report
interviewees' perceptions, not data purporting to dem-
onstrate the existence of, for example, economies of scale.
Second, we did not interview "rank-and-file" physi-
cians. Their perceptions may differ from those of lead-
ers and should be a subject of future research. Third, our
interviewees' responses were focused more on larger than
smaller groups. It is possible that their evaluation of the
relative importance of particular benefits and barriers
would be different for small groups. Finally, we do not

have survey data to compare with interviewees' percep-
tion of an increase in the number of moderate-sized single-
specialty groups.
Seventy years after the report of the Committee on
the Costs of Medical Care,1 the problems the committee
identified still exist. Medical groups, believed by the com-
mittee to be at least a partial solution to these problems,
are perceived by CTS interviewees--including group lead-
ers themselves--as much more focused on increasing their
incomes by gaining negotiating leverage and drawing all
available revenue out of their groups than they are on in-
vesting in improving the quality of care. Was the report
wrong to focus on groups? Should physicians, patients,
corporate and government purchasers of health care, or
government regulators care about the organizational forms
that physician practice takes? Does it matter whether phy-
sicians practice in single-specialty or multispecialty groups
orinsmall,moderate-sized,orlargegroups?Whateverpur-
chasers, health plans, regulators, and hospitals do, phy-
sicians care for patients. They are the final common path-
way through which care is delivered. Although little is

The size and specialty type of groups may matter, whether
groups have useful information systems may matter, and
whether groups implement organized health care man-
