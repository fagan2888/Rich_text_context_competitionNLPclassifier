Abstract
Limited data exists on alcohol, illicit drug, tobacco, gambling, and non-
marital
sexual intercourse among Muslim college students; behaviors which are either
prohibited or strongly discouraged in Islam. To provide preliminary baseline data,
we assessed prevalence of these risk behaviors using a U.S. 2001 national college
survey. Of the 10,401 students surveyed, 135 (1.3%) reported they were raised
in Muslim families. The past year prevalence of risk behaviors among the 135
students was 46.2% for alcohol, 24.6% for illicit drug use, 37.3% for tobacco use,
and 30.4% for gambling. Of the never married students, 53.8% reported ever hav-
ing had sexual intercourse. Gender differences were significant for tobacco use
and gambling. Most Muslim students (58.5%) reported engaging in at least one
risk behavior during the past year, of whom a majority (77.6%) engaged in two or
more behaviors. In multivariate analyses, higher religiosity was protective against
any past year risk behavior. These findings provide critical baseline data on risk
behaviors among Muslim students. They also underscore the need for updated
information and prevention programs.

College traditionally occurs during the transition from adolescence to adult-
hood and may be associated with changes in behavior, including risk behav-
iors (Boyd, McCabe, & Morales, 2005). Risk behaviors refer to those behaviors
which have the potential to negatively impact the psychosocial aspect of suc-
cessful adolescent development (Jessor, 1991). Risk behaviors, such as alcohol
and drug use, can have long term negative impact on public health and have
been associated with negative mental health outcomes for the individual (Glied
& Pine, 2002; Lawrence, Mitrou, Sawyer, & Zubrick, 2010; Mokdad, Marks,
Stroup, & Gerberding, 2004). Despite potential negative impact of risk behav-
iors, it is theorized that engaging in such behaviors are often purposive and
may serve a number of functions such as increasing peer acceptance, assisting
in individuation from family as well as community, and coping with anxiety
(Jessor, 1991). Thus, risk behaviors are rarely isolated but are often interrelated
and functional, highlighting the need for prevention efforts to focus on lifestyle
rather than individual risk behavior (Jessor, 1991).
Such a conceptualization of risk behavior may be particularly helpful in un-
derstanding religious minority emerging adults. As a religious minority in the
U.S., American Muslim college students may encounter and navigate between
multiple groups' behavioral expectations (i.e., societal, religious, and cultural)
as well as experience additional stressors (e.g., discrimination) (Ahmed, 2012).
These stressors coupled with a decrease in parental monitoring, common
among college students, may result in an increase in the prevalence of risk be-
haviors among Muslim college students. Previous research suggests differences
in prevalence of risk behaviors among ethnic minorities (Factor, Kawachi, &
Williams, 2011), which could potentially be extended to religious minorities.
However, many young people do not engage in risk behaviors due to the
buffering effects of protective factors. Religious involvement and religiosity,
across religious affiliations, has found to serve as a protective factor against risk
behaviors such as substance use (Ghandour, Karam, & Maalouf, 2009; Luczak,
Corbett, Oh, Carr, & Wal, 2003; Luczak, Shea, Carr, Li, & Wall, 2006; Mason
& Windle, 2002; Michalak, Trocki, & Bond, 2007). Still, it is also possible that
religiosity may simultaneously serve as both a protective and risk factor, as
evidenced by Zaleski and Schiaffino (2000), who observed that increased reli-
gious identification protected against initiation of sexual activity but resulted
in increased risk of unprotected sex among those who were sexually active.
Currently, scant data exist on the prevalence of risk behaviors among U.S.
Muslim college students. In our review of published literature, we found stud-
ies on risk behaviors of middle and high school Muslim students in Western
Prevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 7
Europe (e.g., Amundsen, Rossow, & Skurtveit, 2005; Chédebois et al., 2009;
Jayakody et al., 2011), but none on college students. The limited information
that exists suggests that Muslim students report low prevalence of most be-
haviors (e.g., Amundsen et al., 2005; Chédebois et al., 2009; Jayakody et al.,
2011), with female Muslim students reporting even lower prevalence than male
Muslim students (e.g., Islam & Johnson, 2003). Furthermore, previous research
did not explore whether Muslim engagement in risk behaviors were isolated
incidents of risk, or a cluster of behaviors, as suggested by Jessor (1991). Only
one study, to our knowledge, explored the protective influence of Islam on a
risk behavior in Western nations (Islam & Johnson, 2003).
Islam, Muslims and Risk behaviors
Alcohol and Drug Use. Alcohol use is strictly prohibited in Islam and any use
would be considered risky. However, alcohol use in the U.S. is prevalent with
63.3% of fulltime U.S. college students reporting past month use (Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMSHA], 2010), with
males reporting greater prevalence than females (O'Malley & Johnston, 2002).
Our previous work using secondary data analysis of a large representative col-
lege survey found 46.6% of Muslim college students drank alcohol in the past
year (Abu-Ras, Ahmed, & Arfken, 2010). However, in a pilot respondent-driven
sampling study of Muslim students at one university, 9% reported lifetime alco-
hol use (Arfken, Ahmed, & Abu-Ras, 2013). The differences may reflect tempo-
ral trends, characteristics of the sample, or the context of one university. To the
authors' knowledge, there are no other studies on the prevalence of alcohol use
among Muslim college students in the U.S.
Similar to alcohol, illicit drug use is prohibited in Islam and any use by a
Muslim is considered risky behavior. Among U.S. college students, 22.0% of full
time college students reported using illicit drugs at least once in the past month
(SAMHSA, 2010), with use higher among males (Johnston, O'Malley, Bach-
man, & Schulenburg, 2012). To the authors' knowledge, there are no studies
on illicit drug use among U.S. Muslim college students. The most comparable
study on illicit drug use among Muslim religious minorities living in Western
countries was conducted in Glasgow, Scotland among a cohort of South Asian
high school students and their classmates (Bradby & Williams, 2006). Of the
South Asians in the sample 79% of students identified as Muslim. Four years
after the initial survey, 29% of the males and 18% of the females (aged 18­20
years old), reported lifetime illicit drug use (Bradby & Williams, 2006). How-
ever, there is no mention if the participants were enrolled in college.
Tobacco Use. Within Islam, tobacco use can be considered a risk behavior
8 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken
as religious scholars' views on tobacco use range from prohibited to strongly
disliked (makruh). Anecdotally, due to the growing knowledge of the nega-
tive health impact of tobacco, scholars are increasingly prohibiting tobacco
use. Past month cigarette use among U.S. full time college students was 24.8 %
(SAMHSA, 2010), with no difference observed between genders (Johnston et
al., 2012). Our pilot respondent-
driven sampling of U.S. Muslim college stu-
dents at one university found 50% had ever consumed tobacco in some form,
including cigarettes and waterpipe (Abu-
Ras, Ahmed, & Arfken, 2012). In the
above mentioned study on South Asian Muslims from Glasgow, Scotland, 24%
of males and 14% females reported being current smokers (Bradby & Williams,
2006).
Gambling. In Islam, any form of gambling is prohibited and considered a
risk behavior. Researchers have referred to gambling as an emerging risk be-
havior among American college students, with a past year prevalence ranging
from 35% to 42%, with males reporting greater prevalence (Atkinson, Sharp,
Schmitz, & Yaroslavsky, 2012; LaBrie, Shaffer, LaPlante, & Wechsler, 2003). To
the authors' knowledge, there are no studies investigating gambling behavior
among Muslim college students in the U.S. or Europe.
Sexual Behaviors. In Islam any form of non-
marital intimacy, including
sexual intercourse, is prohibited and considered a risk behavior. In the U.S.,
the lifetime prevalence of non-
marital sexual intercourse was 76% of college
students according to one study; however gender differences were not report-
ed (Higgins, Mullinax, Trussell, Davidson, & Moore, 2011). To the authors'
knowledge, there are no studies reporting the lifetime prevalence of non-
marital sexual intercourse among U.S. or European Muslim college students.
Objectives
The focus of this study is to address the current gap in literature on the preva-
lence of risk behaviors among U.S. Muslims college students by establishing
a baseline for more detailed future research. We expand upon our previous
analysis examining alcohol use among U.S. Muslim college students (Abu-
Ras
et al., 2010) to explore illicit drug use, tobacco use, gambling, and non-
marital
intercourse. Based upon the literature among younger European Muslim stu-
dents, we hypothesize: (a) that the prevalence of risk behaviors among U.S.
Muslim college students will be low (b) that the prevalence of risk behaviors
among female Muslim college students will be lower than males, (c) those who
engage in risk behavior are more likely to engage in more than one risk behav-
ior, and (d) students reporting religious activities as important will have lower
prevalence of risk behaviors.
Prevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 9
Method
Survey
For this analysis, we used data from the 2001 Harvard School of Public Health
College Alcohol Study's (CAS) public access database (Wechsler, 2001, http://
www.icpsr.umich.edu). The database contains surveys from a national sample
of students at accredited four-
year colleges and universities (119 colleges in 38
states and the District of Columbia). Additional information regarding sam-
pling and methodology are available elsewhere (Wechsler, Lee, Kuo, & Lee,
2000b; Wechsler, Lee, Kuo, Seibring, Nelson, & Lee, 2002a; Wechsler, Lee, Nel-
son, & Kuo, 2002b; Wechsler, Nelson, Lee, Kuo, Seibring et al., 2003).
Measures
The 2001 CAS survey included self-
reported measures of alcohol, tobacco, il-
licit drug use, gambling, and sexual behaviors. The survey also included infor-
mation on religious heritage of the students and one question on religiosity.
Demographic measures were also used to contextualize the findings.
Demographic variables. Variables assessed included: age, gender, mari-
tal status, ethnicity and living arrangements. Racial identification was limited
to one of the following choices: White, Black/African American, Asian/Pacific
Islander, Native American, and Other. Ethnicities, such Arab or Persian, were
not a choice for participants. Living arrangements were assessed by asking par-
ticipants, "With whom do you currently live?" Participants could select one or
more of the following responses: alone, roommates or housemates, spouse or
partner, parents or other relatives.
Religious heritage and religiosity. Religious heritage was determined
based on the participant's response to the question, "In what religion were you
raised?" The answers included six categories: "None", "Catholicism," "Judaism",
"Islam", "Protestantism", and "Other". We refer to students who answered "Is-
lam" as Muslim students and students who responded with any other category
as Non-
Muslim students. No questions were asked about current affiliation or
specific religious behavior. Religiosity was assessed based on the participant's
self-
report on the importance of participating in religious activities in college
with answers range from "Very Important", "Important", "Somewhat Important"
to "Not at all Important". No other question in the survey assessed religiosity.
Alcohol. Participants were asked, "When did you last have a drink (that is
more than just a few sips)?" The questionnaire instructed participants to define
a "drink" in equivalent amounts of alcohol: a 12-
oz (360-
mL) bottle or can of
beer, a 4-
oz (120-
mL) glass of wine, a 12-
oz (360-
mL) bottle or can of wine
10 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken
cooler, or a shot (1.25 oz or 37mL) of liquor, either straight or in a mixed drink.
Possible responses included: "I have never had a drink"; "not in the past year";
"more than 30 days ago, but in the past year"; "more than a week ago, but in
the past 30 days"; and "within the last week". For the purpose of this study, the
responses were collapsed into the following categories: ever, past year, never.
In addition, participants were also asked "How old were you when you first
drank alcohol regularly." Three Muslim students did not answer the alcohol use
question.
Illicit drug use. Illicit drug use was assessed by asking participants "How
often, if ever, have you used any of the drugs listed below?" Participants were
specifically asked about the following substances: marijuana, crack or other
forms of cocaine, barbiturates (e.g. Seconal, Nembutal, downs, or Yellow Jack-
ets), Ritalin/Dexedrine/Adderall, other amphetamines (e.g. methamphet-
amines, crystal meth, speed, uppers, ups), tranquilizers (e.g. Valium, Librium,
Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin), heroin, other opiate-
type prescription drugs (e.g.,
Codeine, Morphine, Demerol, Percodan, Percocet, Vicodin, Darvon, Darvo-
cet), LSD, other psychedelics or hallucinogens (e.g., mushrooms, mescaline, or
PCP), ecstasy (MDMA), other "party drugs" (e.g., Ketamine, Special K, GHB),
anabolic steroids (either injections like Depo-
testosterone or Durbolin, or pills
like Anadrol, Dianabol, or Winstrol), and other performance-
enhancing drugs
(e.g., growth hormone, diuretics, fluid pills, ephedrine). Participants were in-
structed not to include drugs that were being taken under physician supervi-
sion. Information on marijuana use was obtained by asking participants, "How
often, if ever, have you used marijuana", and "How old were you when you first
used marijuana." For all illicit drugs, possible responses included: never used,
used but NOT in past 12 months, used but NOT in the past 30 days, used in the
past 30 days. For the purpose of this study, the responses were collapsed into
the following categories: ever, past year, and never. Eight Muslim students did
not answer the question on illicit drugs but all Muslim students answered the
questions on marijuana. The eight Muslim students with missing information
on illicit drugs reported that they had not used marijuana.
Tobacco use. Tobacco use was measured by asking participants "How of-
ten, if ever, have you used any of the drugs listed below?" Participants were
asked about their use of the following forms of tobacco: cigarettes, cigar, pipe
tobacco, bidis and chewing tobacco, dip, or snuff. Waterpipe use was not in-
cluded. Participants were also asked specifically about their cigarette use. "How
often, if ever, have you used cigarettes," and "How old were you when you first
used cigarettes." Possible responses for tobacco use were: never used, used but
NOT in past 12 months, used but NOT in the past 30 days, used in the past
30 days. For the purpose of this study, the responses were collapsed into the
following categories: ever, past year, never. One Muslim student did not an-
swer question about tobacco use, and eight Muslim students did not answer the
Prevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 11
questions about cigarette use. The one Muslim student with missing informa-
tion on tobacco use reported no cigarette use.
Gambling. Students were questioned about their gambling behaviors in
the past school year only. The following forms of gambling were specifically
queried: betting on professional sports; betting on college sports; betting on
horse or dog races; casino gambling; betting on the lottery or the "numbers;"
internet betting or gambling; and betting with a bookie, card, dice, or other
games of chance while at school. Possible responses included: never, a few
times a year, monthly but not weekly, weekly but not daily, daily. For the pur-
pose of this study, the responses were collapsed into the following categories:
ever, past year, never. Data was missing for two Muslim participants.
Sexual activity. Participants were asked, "If you have ever been sexually
active, has it been with . . ." Participants were given the following choices: "I
have never been sexually active", "opposite sex", "same sex partner", or "both
opposite and same sex partners". For the purpose of this study, the responses
were collapsed into the following categories: ever been sexually active or never.
In addition, participants were asked, "When you have sexual intercourse, how
often do you and your partner use a condom." Possible responses include: nev-
er, rarely, sometimes, and always. For the purpose of this study the responses
were collapsed into always or sometimes/rarely/never. Analysis was limited to
participants who said they had never been married. Data was missing for 16
Muslim students.
Procedures
The original researchers mailed the survey to students beginning in February
2001. Most students returned the surveys received by May 2001, with five stu-
dents returning the survey as late as August 2001. The reported response rate
was 52%.
Data analysis
The analysis used weights provided by the original researchers. Descriptive
statistics were used to describe the sample characteristics and prevalence of
risky behaviors. Chi-
square analyses were conducted to test for associations in
sample characteristics and prevalence by gender. For bivariate analysis, each
risk behavior was analyzed individually, which may result in slightly different
sample sizes due to missing data. For non-
marital intercourse, the analysis was
limited to students who had never been married. Imputation was not conduct-
ed as less than 10% of the data was missing and the sample size was relatively
small. For multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis was used to assess
the independent associations with any past year risk taking behavior. Data was
12 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken
missing for 2 Muslim students. Associations were summarized as odds ratios
(OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results
Demographic Characteristics
Of the 10,401 students in the sample, 135 (1.3%) reported they were raised
in Muslim families. The sample of Muslim students was predominately male
(65.2%) and had never married (88.9%). The sample of Muslim students con-
sisted of: 42.7% Other, 23.9% Asian American/Pacific Islander, 23.1% White,
and 10.9% African-
American. Half of the participants (50.4%) were under
21 years of age, whereas 30% were between the ages of 22­23, and 19.3% of
the participants were over 23 years. A majority of students (68.7%) lived with
friends or on-
campus housing, compared to the minority (31.3%) who lived
with parents/relatives. The responses on the importance of religious activity
varied: 21.8% not at all important, 18.0% somewhat important, 27.1% impor-
tant, and 33.1% very important.
Risk behaviors
Alcohol Use. As previously reported (Abu-
Ras et al., 2010), 46.2% of Mus-
lim students had consumed alcohol in the past year, with no significant differ-
ence by gender (males 44.8% versus females 47.7%) (Table 1). For the Muslim
students who reported drinking, 60% reporting regular alcohol use began at
age 18 or older. To contextualize these results, past year alcohol consumption
among non-
Muslim students was 80.7%, with over half of individuals (56.1%)
beginning regular consumption at age 18 or older. Among the non-
Muslim
students, no gender difference in prevalence of alcohol consumption was ob-
served. More in depth analysis of patterns of alcohol use among U.S. Muslim
college students within this sample can be found in Abu-
Ras, et al. (2010).
Illicit Drug Use. Muslim students past year prevalence of illicit drug use
was 24.6% with no significant difference by gender (males 27.9% versus fe-
males 19.1%). Similarly, past year reported marijuana use was 23.9%, with no
statistically significant gender difference (males 27.6% and females 17.0%). For
the Muslim students reporting marijuana use, 52.4% indicated their first expe-
rience using marijuana occurred before 18 years of age. In order to contextu-
alize these findings, past year prevalence rates for non-
Muslim students were
32.9% for illicit drugs (males 34.5% versus females 31.4%) and 29.8% mari-
juana (males 32.1% versus females 27.9%), with gender differences observed
for both illicit drugs (2=9.9, df=1, p<.005) and marijuana (2=21.0, df=1,
Prevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 13
p<.001). For non-
Muslim students, the majority began marijuana use (64.5%)
prior to turning 18 years.
Tobacco Use. Past year prevalence of tobacco use among Muslim students
was 37.3%, with males reporting significantly higher rates than females (43.7%
versus 25.5%; 2=4.30, df=1, p<.05). The prevalence of past year cigarette use
was 37.0%, with males more likely to report cigarette use than females (44.4%

versus 23.9%; 2=5.31, df=1, p<.05). For Muslim students reporting cigarette
use, 55.9% indicated their first experience began at 18 years or older. To con-
textualize these results, we also analyzed tobacco use prevalence among non-
Muslim students. Among the non-
Muslim students 41.4% report tobacco use
(males 47.3% versus females 36.7%) and 34.5% cigarettes use (males 34.8%
versus females 34.1%) with gender differences found only for tobacco use
(2=118, df=1, p<.001). Unlike the Muslim students, only a minority of non-
Muslim students (32.3%) began cigarette use after 18 years of age
Gambling. Muslim students had past year prevalence of gambling of 30.4%,
with higher prevalence among males (36.4% versus females 19.1%; 2=4.29,
df=1, p<.05). Among the Muslim students reporting gambling, a majority
68.8% reported their first experience was at 18 years or older. To contextualize
these findings, non-
Muslim students, 42.1% reported past year prevalence of
gambling, with males reporting greater prevalence than females (52% males
versus 33% females, 2=368.9, df=1, p<.001), with a majority (66.6%) begin-
ning gambling before 18 years of age.
Sexual behaviors. The prevalence of lifetime sexual intercourse among
never married Muslim college students was 53.8%, with no significant dif-
ference by gender (males 57.1% and females 47.6%). Among sexually active,
never married Muslim students, 66% never to sometimes use condoms dur-
ing non-
marital intercourse. A comparison of condom use by gender among
never-
married Muslims was not conducted due to small sample size. Informa-
tion about the age of first sexual intercourse experience was not collected by
the original researchers and thus could not be examined. To contextualize the
present findings, prevalence of lifetime sexual intercourse among never mar-
ried non-
Muslim students was 68.2%, with no gender difference observed. The
prevalence of condom use during sexual intercourse among sexually active,
never married non-
Muslim students was 46.6%.
Number of risk behaviors
Approximately 58.5% of Muslim college students reported having engaged in
at least one risk behavior (alcohol use, illicit drug use, tobacco use or gambling,
but not sexual intercourse) within the past year (Table 2). No gender difference
in mean number of risk behaviors endorsed was observed. Of the individu-
als engaging in at least one risk behavior during the past year, 77.6% engaged
in two or more risk behaviors. To contextualize these findings, 86.6% of non-
Muslims students engaged in at least one risk behavior within the past year. Of
those engaging in past year risk behavior, 72.0% engaged in two or more risk
behaviors.
Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association of
measures with any of the four past year risk behaviors (alcohol, illicit drugs,
Prevalence of Risk Behaviors among U.S. Muslim College Students 15
tobacco, and gambling). Sexual intercourse among non-
married students was
not included due to lack of data on past year behavior. The independent vari-
ables included in the model were gender, living at home (to reflect greater pa-
rental monitoring), and religiosity. In the analysis religiosity was found to be
independently associated with absence from any risk behaviors in the past year
(p <.05). Each one point increase (on the four point religiosity measure) in
religiosity was protective against past year risk taking behavior (OR= 0.60, 95%
CI 0.43­0.84). Living at home was in the direction of being protective (OR=
0.58, 95% CI 0.27­1.26) but due to the small sample size was not significant.
To contextualize the results, the model was then conducted with non-
Muslim
students and found that religiosity (OR=0.51, 95% CI 0.48-
.053) and living at
home (OR= 0.58, 95% CI 0.51-0.67) were independently associated with en-
gaging in any risk behavior in the past year
Discussion
This analysis extends our prior research on alcohol use among U.S. Muslim
college students (Abu-
Ras et al., 2010) to other risk behaviors and provides
critically needed baseline data on risk behaviors among U.S. Muslim college
students.
Of concern, U.S. Muslim college students reported high levels of risk be-
haviors, given religious prohibitions. The current findings were comparable to
the prevalence rates of illicit drug and tobacco use found among 18­20 year
old Scottish Muslims (Bradby & Williams, 2006). In addition, our hypothesis
regarding statistical differences based on gender was only supported for gam-
bling and tobacco. Consistent with our hypothesis, students who engaged in
any risk behavior often engaged in multiple risk behaviors. These findings pro-
vide additional support to Jessor's (1991) notion that risk behaviors often occur
as interrelated clusters. Furthermore, the analysis supports our hypothesis for
the protective effect of religiosity against risk behaviors (Haber, Grant, Jacob,
Koenig, & Heath, 2012; Johnson, Sheets, & Kristeller, 2008; Michalak, Trocki,

16 Sameera Ahmed, Wahiba Abu-Ras, and Cynthia Arfken
& Bond, 2007). However, it is important to note that even Muslim students
who ranked religious activities as very important also reported risk behaviors.
Although this analysis highlights the prevalence of certain risk behaviors,
it cannot address the mediators (e.g., sources of influence, situational factors,
functional aspects of risk) that influence engaging in risk behaviors. Hence,
additional studies identifying mediators of risk behaviors in American Muslim
college students are needed. Potential mediators and moderators include family
dynamics (e.g., parent-
child communication, family cohesion, parental moni-
toring, and parenting style), peer relationships (e.g., influence, socialization,
peer risk behaviors), neighborhood context (e.g., presence/absence of Muslims
and community cohesion), religious community (e.g., degree of interaction,
congregational culture), and societal context (e.g., group status, perceived dis-
crimination). In addition, further studies are needed to address mental health
outcomes of engaging in risk behaviors.
This present study highlights that Muslim students are not immune to
engaging in risk behaviors and, like other emerging adults, often engage in
a cluster of risk behaviors (Jessor, 1991). At present, evidence-
based preven-
tion services specifically tailored to Muslim students do not exist. As such, it is
imperative that comprehensive, religiously and culturally sensitive prevention
and intervention programs be developed to address risk behavior life styles for
this population. From prior research (Arfken, Owens, & Said, 2012), we know
that at least some Muslim students exposed to prevention programs in high
school considered them irrelevant to their community due to lack of known
prevalence estimates of Muslims engaging in risk behaviors. Developed tai-
lored programs must target both males and females, given the lack of signifi-
cant difference in prevalence rates, however researchers should make sure to
explore possible difference in engagement and circumstances that could be
incorporated in applied settings. The findings also highlight the need to bet-
ter understand the functional purpose of the risk behavior with the realiza-
tion that risk behavior occurs in a larger social context, as suggested by Jessor
(1991). For example if a student's use of substance is recreational, a different
intervention approach would be used as opposed to student's using substance
as a coping mechanism to deal with stress. Importantly, these interventions
must begin at the minimum in high school and continue throughout college
because a substantial proportion of students reported first time use of regular
drinking, marijuana, and cigarette use prior to college.
Despite the numerous implications of the current findings, there are also
some limitations. Specifically, the sample size of Muslim students was small
and analysis was limited by using a secondary data source. As such we did
not know country of birth/immigration status of participants, current religious
practice, and presence of other Muslims on campus. In addition, the data was
collected in 2001, prior to the events of September 11, 2001 which resulted in

increased attention on Muslims in America. Lastly, water pipe smoking, an
increasingly popular risk taking behavior among college students in general
and Muslim students in particular (Abu-
Ras et al., 2012) was not reported in
the public access database and should be included as a form of tobacco use in
future studies. These limitations emphasize the need for a new survey to update
and expand the present findings to develop appropriately tailored prevention
programs.
