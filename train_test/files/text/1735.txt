Purpose: We sought to determine the prevalence of
remediable health conditions from in-home geriatric
assessments of referred adult protective service (APS)
clients suffering elder mistreatment. Design and Meth-
ods: We used a retrospective cohort study of 211 APS
clients (74% female; age, M ¼ 77 years) in two central
New Jersey counties. Results: Dementia was the most
frequent diagnosis (62% prevalence) and was positively
correlated with occurrences of financial exploitation (R¼
.199; p¼.01) and caregiver neglect (R¼.174; p¼.03)
among female APS clients. Depression (37% preva-
lence), hypertension (36%), involuntary weight loss
(34%), pain (32%), and falling (26%) all appeared
equally distributed, though urinary incontinence (23%
prevalence) was strongly correlated with circumstances
of caregiver neglect (R ¼ .31; p ¼ .003). Implica-
tions: This new effort to link APS workers with geriatric
clinicians conducting in-home health assessments
proved effective for identifying a high prevalence of
remediable health conditions among APS clients suffer-
ing various manifestations of elder mistreatment.

According to the 1996 National Elder Abuse In-
cidence Study (National Center on Elder Abuse, 1998),
approximately 550,000 older adults experienced elder
mistreatment in domestic settings, though only 21%
of these were reported to and substantiated by adult
protective services (APS). Significant variations be-
tween states in the rates of reporting, investigating, and
substantiating domestic elder mistreatment have re-
cently been described, which may contribute to such
underreporting (Jogerst et al., 2003). In community-
based survey research, the prevalence of self-reported
events of elder mistreatment among independently
living elderly persons ranges from 3% to 5% (Comijs,
Pot, Smit, Bouter, & Jonker, 1998; Pillemer &
Finkelhor, 1988; Podkieks, 1992), though variations in
definitions and terminology make comparisons difficult
(National Academy of Sciences, 2002).
Health care professionals constitute one of the
largest reporting sources of possible elder mistreatment
to APS agencies, according to the 2000 State Survey of
Adult Protective Services (National Center on Elder

Abuse, 2000), though the nature of health conditions
among victims of elder mistreatment is ill defined
(Jones, Veenstra, Seamon, & Krohmer, 1997). Elder
mistreatment, however, has been shown to have
a significant impact on the mortality of its victims,
independent of other comorbidities (Lachs & Pillemer,
2004; Lachs, Williams, O'Brien, Pillemer, & Charlson,
1998). Other studies based on hospital-based clinical-
assessment services (Coyne, Reichman, & Berbig, 1993;
Dyer, Pavlik, Murphy, & Hyman, 2000) have identified
a high prevalence of dementia and depression among
those suffering neglect or abuse. In some settings, APS
agencies have established relationships with health
care providers to jointly respond to elder-mistreatment
occurrences (Dyer et al., 1999; Mosqueda, Burnight,
Liao, & Kemp, 2004), often in association with
concurrent medical education (Heath, Dyer, Kerzner,
Mosqueda, & Murphy, 2002).
Our current study describes the diagnostic findings
of medical and functional conditions from one such
collaboration between APS agencies and a geriatric-
assessment service in assessing homebound older adults
who were experiencing various forms of elder mis-
treatment. Our study objectives were to describe the
prevalence of remediable geriatric conditions and to
seek associations between such previously undiagnosed
findings with the type of mistreatment the APS clients
undergoing the assessment were suffering.
Methods
Setting
In 1998, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
provided funding to initiate an in-home interdisciplinary
geriatric medical-assessment service called Linking Geri-
atrics With Adult Protective Services (LGAPS) to serve
the APS units in Middlesex and Somerset counties in
central New Jersey. APS regulations in New Jersey focus
on vulnerable adults residing in the community who,
because of physical or mental illness, disability, or defi-
ciency, lacksufficient understanding or capacityto make,
communicate, or carry out decisions concerning their
well-being and therefore are at risk for abuse, neglect, or
financial exploitation. APS social workers respond to
reports of alleged mistreatment by investigating the cir-
cumstances of the vulnerable adult and intervening on
behalf of the client to remediate the mistreatment issues
that have been substantiated. New Jersey provides train-
ing for its APS workers about the recognition of common
health-related impairments in the elderly population and
the use of screening tools for reviewing functional skills.
Prior to the initiation of LGAPS, participating
geriatric clinicians met with the APS staffs in both
counties to review their training in recognizing health
issues and to discuss the collaborative process by which
the social work and health care teams might work best
together. Referrals to the LGAPS in-home assessment
service were made by the APS workers from among their
clients with substantiated mistreatment who had unmet
healthneedsat thetime ofthe initial APScontact. LGAPS
assessment services were limited to those APS clients
who did not have an existing health care provider that
could be identified by the APS worker or who refused to
leave their homes to access a prior source of health care
services as recommended by their APS workers.
LGAPS assessments were conducted by a nurse
practitioner­geriatrician physician team in collabora-
tion with the referring social worker at the residence of
the referred APS client. The assessment process included
a detailed medical and functional history along with
a limited physical examination, including blood pres-
sure measurements, assessment of gait and mobility,
visual and hearing acuities, and formal screening
assessment of cognition (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh,
1975), depression (Yesavage et al., 1983), and nutritional
status (American Academy of Family Physicians, 1999).
This retrospective cohort study is based on assess-
ments of 211 APS clients referred for LGAPS assess-
ments from June 1999 through April 2002. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the
Protection of Human Subjects of the University of
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Robert Wood
Johnson Medical School.
Outcome Measures
The classifications of mistreatment--neglect, finan-
cial exploitation, and abuse--that we used came from
the APS workers and reflected the state-reporting
terminology in use at the time of the study (New Jersey
State Department of Health and Senior Services, 2000).
These classifications served as independent variables
correlated with the findings of the geriatric-assessment
process, grouped into medical diagnoses of dementia,
depression, hypertension, diabetes, and active pain;
involuntary weight loss; and functional issues of falling,
incontinence, uncorrected vision or hearing sensory
impairments, limited food access, and alcohol abuse.
Data Analysis
We entered data into SPSS for Windows Version 11.0
for descriptive statistics and tests for associations using
both parametric and nonparametric statistical measures.
Results
Demographics of Study Population
The mean age of the 211 APS clients referred for
assessments was 77 years, with 155 (74%) women and 56
(26%)men.Racialandethnicdistributionwasasfollows:
166 non-Hispanic White (80%); 28 non-Hispanic African
American (12%); 6 Hispanic (3%); 6 Asian (3%); and 5
other (2%). Sixty percent of this cohort was living alone
at the time of the assessment, and there were no
significantgenderdifferencesinage,race,livingsituation,
or county of residence between assessedmen and women.
Classification of Elder Mistreatment
Self-neglect was by far the most common manifesta-
tion of mistreatment among patients referred for
assessment (161 cases), although most APS clients
Vol. 45, No. 6, 2005 821
referred for assessment had more than one form of
mistreatment identified by the APS workers at the time
of referral. There were 100 occurrences of caregiver
neglect, 62 reports of exploitation, and 31 reports of
physical abuse. Although we noted no significant
patterns of age or racial distributions among these
classifications of mistreatment, women who were
referred for assessment were more likely to have
suffered exploitation than men (v2 ¼ 6.5; p ¼ .011).
When we examined living circumstances, self-neglect
appeared to be associated primarily with women who
were living alone (v2 ¼ 25.0; p , .0001). Of the 31 cases
of physical abuse, 6 of the 7 abused men were living with
a caregiver present, whereas for the 24 women there
were equal numbers distributed among those living with
the perpetrator present and those living alone.
Diagnostic and Functional Findings
Table 1 shows the overall prevalence of assessment
findings and statistically significant positive correla-
tions with various forms of mistreatment. Dementia
was the most prevalent newly diagnosed condition,
found in 62% of referred APS clients. A diagnosis of
dementia was positively correlated with caregiver
neglect among women (R ¼ .17; p ¼ .03) but not
among men. However, the mean Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975) perfor-
mance score was significantly poorer for APS clients of
both genders who had suffered caregiver neglect than
for those who had not experienced neglect (14.6 vs
19.6; p , .0001). There were no significant differences
in the MMSE performance score among those suffering
financial exploitation or physical abuse.
Depression was the second most common diagnosis
(37%) and was not associated with any single form of
mistreatment. Hypertension was diagnosed in 36% of
assessed cases whereas diabetes mellitus was identified
among 16% of assessed cases. Neither medical di-
agnosis was associated with any particular form of
elder mistreatment.
Nutritional concerns were commonly identified
among assessed individuals, with 127 individuals
having either unintentional weight loss (34%) or
limited food access (25%) identified. These nutritional
issues were not associated with any individual type of
elder mistreatment, nor were there statistical associa-
tions identified with the living situation of those with
these nutritional concerns.
A significantly high prevalence of pain (32%) was
identified in this cohort. Among these 69 individuals, 28
(13% of the total population) had severe, uncontrolled
pain at the time of the assessment that required
immediate intervention. Women living alone were
more likely to have unaddressed pain-management
issues (v2 ¼ 11.8, p ¼ .003), as were those with higher
cognitive performance scores (mean MMSE of those
with pain control issues 22.0 vs 15.2 of those without
pain; p , .0001). We did not find pain to be correlated
with any single category of elder mistreatment.
Targeted functional conditions included falling,
incontinence, and sensory impairment. A total of 58
individuals (26%) had fallen, and no single form of
mistreatment was associated with this finding. How-
ever, urinary incontinence, which was another highly
prevalent functional issue identified among 23% of
assessed individuals, was highly correlated with having
suffered caregiver neglect (R ¼ .371; p ¼ .003). Sensory
impairment of vision or hearing was found in 47
assessed individuals (22%). Caregiver neglect was
associated with this sensory impairment among men
(R ¼ .31; p ¼ .022) but not among women.
Twenty-two individuals (10.4%) had alcohol misuse
identified during their assessment. We found alcohol
abuse to be positively correlated with having suffered
physical abuse among these 17 women (R ¼ .20; p ¼
.01) but not for the 5 men.
Discussion
The high prevalence of remediable geriatric con-
ditions identified in this cohort of APS clients reflects
effective case finding by the participating APS workers
collaborating with geriatric health care clinicians. The
211 clients referred during this 35-month study period
constituted 22% of the total case load of substantiated
cases of mistreatment in both counties.
The predominance of neglect among the APS clients
described here is consistent with the known national
distribution of the various forms of elder mistreatment
(Lachs & Pillemer, 1995). The high prevalence of
dementia and of depression in this study is also
consistent with findings in previous studies focused on
neglected populations (Coyne et al., 1993; Dyer et al.,
2000). The gender differences seen with the associations
of exploitation and caregiver neglect among demented
women and caregiver neglect among men with un-
corrected sensory impairment and with physical abuse
occurring among women with alcohol abuse have not
been reported previously.

822 The Gerontologist
The frequency of pain issues among assessed
individuals was not found to be associated with any
single form of mistreatment and provides an important
modifiable feature that should be sought among older
adult victims. Cognitively impaired clients may not
have been able to report pain as well as those with
better cognitive function. Pain may have been one of
the most recognized ``unmet health needs'' identified by
the referring APS social workers, in part reflecting the
declining health state of their clients suffering abuse or
neglect (Reyes-Gibby, Aday, & Cleeland, 2002).
The frequency of unintentional weight loss was not
found to be associated with any individual form of elder
mistreatment and identifies another feature that should
be investigated among older adult victims, as it may be
a marker for serious undiagnosed underlying disease.
Health care providers will encounter older patients
presenting with symptoms or signs of possible mis-
treatment that may include but are not limited to the
following: neglect of personal hygiene, health, or
welfare; hindered access to needed medical services;
inadequately explained multiple bruising, pressure
sores, or other trauma; and psychological signs of
maltreatment or impoverishment. When such signs are
identified, providers must take the appropriate action
of reporting such situations to the APS-responding
agency for investigation and intervention (Jogerst et al.,
2003; Lachs & Pillemer, 2004).
An important limitation of these data is their
applicability to other populations of abused or neglected
elders living in community settings but not having been
identified as having unmet health needs, the determina-
tion used by the APS social workers to trigger the LGAPS
assessment process described here. Other APS clients
with similar unmet health needs will have an identified
physician or other source of health care that can be
enlisted by the APS workers. In addition, the provision of
the assessment process described here was conducted in
the home setting and therefore was limited in the
thoroughness of some elements of the diagnostic pro-
cess, although the home setting facilitated other aspects
of the assessment process (e.g., falling assessment).
Another common concern in elder mistreatment
research is the lack of common terminology across APS
agencies to categorize manifestations of elder mis-
treatment. Prior reports (Levine, 2003; Daly & Jogerst,
2001) have documented the variation between states in
the use of mistreatment classification terms such as
abandonment (not used in New Jersey) as well as
terminology such as self-neglect, which is included
among the issues that APS must address in New Jersey.
Finally, the prevalence rates and diagnostic associations
described here are based on a community-dwelling
sample of mistreated adults and may not reflect the
experience of mistreated residents living in institutional
settings such as nursing homes. This study does have
relevance for questions regarding institutionalization,
however, because APS-service utilization has been
identified as a ``risk factor'' for nursing home placement
(Lachs, Williams, O'Brien, & Pillemer, 2002).
In conclusion, the high prevalence of identification
of many remediable geriatric health issues among
community-dwelling victims of elder mistreatment
resulted from a productive collaboration between geri-
atric health care providers and APS workers responding
to elder abuse and neglect.
