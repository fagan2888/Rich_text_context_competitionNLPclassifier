Introduction
An estimated 65.7 million Americans function as informal
caregivers of ill or disabled individuals, and more than 3 in
10 U.S. households (31.2%; 36.5 million households) report
being served by an unpaid family caregiver. Among these
caregivers, 7 in 10 take care of someone 50 years of age or
older (AARP, 2009). Caregivers are predominantly female
(66%; AARP, 2004, 2009; Coleman & Pandya, 2002).
Research has shown differences among populations of male
and female caregivers, such as in the types of care they pro-
vide to their care recipients. For example, The National
Alliance for Caregiving survey has reported that male care-
givers are less likely to provide personal care (AARP, 2009).
Male and female caregivers also experience caregiving dif-
ferently (AARP, 2009; de Cordova et al., 2010; Kao, 2003;
Kao & McHugh, 2004; Lawrence, Goodnow, Woods, &
Karantzas, 2002; Navaie-Waliser, Spriggs, & Feldman,
2002; Vitaliano et al., 2002; Vitaliano, Zhang, & Scanlan,
2003; Wallsten, 2000).
One study using a cross-sectional design interviewed
1,002 randomly selected and nationally representative care-
givers and found that female caregivers were significantly
more likely to be better educated and unemployed; to provide
more intensive and complex care; to have difficulty balancing
care provision with other family and employment responsi-
bilities; to suffer from poorer emotional health secondary to
caregiving; and to cope with caregiving responsibilities by
forgoing respite and by engaging in increased religious activi-
ties (Navaie-Waliser et al., 2002). Studies have also shown
that female caregivers, compared with male caregivers, per-
ceive caregiving as more burdensome (Kao, 2003; Kao &
McHugh, 2004; Kramer & Kipnis, 1995; Lawrence et al.,
2002; Lutzky & Knight, 1994; Nagatomo et al., 1999;
Wallsten, 2000) and report higher levels of depression and
anxiety and lower levels of subjective well-being (AARP,
2004; Johnson & Wiener, 2006; Yee & Schulz, 2000). Female
caregivers who provide 36 or more hours per week of care to
a spouse have been shown to have a dramatic increase in risk
of mental health problems (Cannuscio et al., 2002). Vitaliano
et al. (2002) also found that different factors may result in
distress at different times for male and female caregivers. For
female caregivers, distress (e.g., burden or sleep problems)
resulted directly from the caregiving tasks and lack of social
resources. For male caregivers, vulnerability was a factor that
resulted in distress initially, while lack of social resources

Differences in Outcomes of Caregiver
Support Services for Male and Female
Caregivers
Ya-Mei Chen1
Abstract
The objective of this study is to determine whether different types of caregiver support services are associated with different
outcomes for male and female caregivers. Information was obtained on 148 caregivers' use of three types of support services
provided by government-contracted agencies: counseling and education services, respite and supplemental services, and
financial services. Five caregiver outcomes were included. Use of counseling and education services and financial services was
associated with better caregiver outcomes in female caregivers, but not male caregivers. Among caregivers using respite and
supplemental types of services, male caregivers showed better outcomes than did female caregivers. Female caregivers who
used respite and supplemental services showed worse outcomes in caregiver mastery and caregiver satisfaction than those
who did not use the services. Male and female caregivers responded differently to the caregiver support service. Providing
female caregivers with counseling services along with respite services may result in added benefits for female caregivers.

became more important later, resulting in higher distress
(Vitaliano et al., 2002).
The older population in the United States is fast increas-
ing, and the caregiver support ratio (The ratio of the popula-
tion aged 45-64 to the population aged above 80) will
plummet when the first baby boomers begin turning 80, the
age at which the need for long-term care support increases.
The Federal Commission on Long-Term Care has taken an
important step to elevate family caregiving as a public issue
that can no longer be ignored and to call for research on care-
giver interventions to see what supportive services work best
and for whom (Redfood, Feinberg, & Houser, 2013).
Although the magnitude of effects of caregiver support inter-
ventions found in the literature is inconsistent, research stud-
ieshaveshownpositiveeffectsandthatdifferentinterventions
are associated with different outcomes for caregivers (Cassie
& Sanders, 2008; Chen, Hedrick, & Young, 2009; Lopez-
Hartmann, Wens, Verhoeven, & Remmen, 2012; Mason et
al., 2007; Shaw et al., 2009). However, most studies have
focused only on evaluating the effects of caregiver interven-
tions and have not addressed the commission's call to explore
the usefulness of different services to different populations
of caregivers. To begin to answer this call, in the aim of
understanding how different characteristics among caregiv-
ers are associated with the outcomes of particular caregiver
interventions, the current study explores how male and
female caregivers respond to support services. We hope our
study findings may be helpful to future development of care-
giver support services.
Most research studies have examined caregiver related
intervention as a monolithic category or have assessed only
one particular outcome, such as caregiver burden (Brodaty,
Green, & Koschera, 2003; Burns, Nichols, Martindale-
Adams, Graney, & Lummus, 2003; Gallagher-Thompson et
al., 2003; Lee & Cameron, 2004; Maas et al., 2004;
Newcomer, Yordi, DuNah, Fox, & Wilkinson, 1999; Roberts
et al., 1999; Toseland, Blanchard, & McCallion, 1995; Zank
& Schacke, 2002). Only a few studies have used multiple
measures to examine caregiver support service outcomes.
Chen and colleagues developed and tested an evaluation tool
to assess multiple outcomes to evaluate different caregiver
support services. Their study findings showed that different
caregiver support services are associated with different care-
giver outcomes (Chen et al., 2009). The current study used
the multiple outcome measurements used in Chen and col-
leagues' study, and further investigated whether different
services were associated with different outcomes for male
versus female caregivers.
Purpose of Study
The purpose of this study was to determine whether different
types of caregiver support services are associated with differ-
ent caregiver outcomes for male versus female caregivers.
We collaborated with Aging and Disability Services (ADS),
the local Area Agency on Aging (AAA) in Seattle,
Washington, in a pilot study that evaluated a federally funded
and state-funded project, the Family Caregiver Support
Program (FCSP), in King County in Washington State. In
this region, the FCSP provides various services to caregivers
and their care recipients, including adult day care, in-home
respite, information services, and financial assistance to
caregivers (ADS, 2003).
Method
Design, Setting, and Participants
This study was a descriptive, one-time survey of caregivers
living in King County who were reported as having received
services from local service agencies of ADS. Four local ser-
vice agencies agreed to send out an invitation letter and ques-
tionnaire to all caregivers who had received FCSP-funded
services. The University of Washington Human Subjects
Division approved this study.
Data Collection Method
For this study, each agency sent each of their caregiver cli-
ents a cover letter, a questionnaire, and a postage-paid return
envelope addressed to ADS. To protect client confidentiality,
the questionnaires were anonymous, and no follow-up
occurred. A total of 866 survey packets were sent out, and
177 questionnaires (20.4%) were returned.
Measurements
The FCSP is a program with multiple components, which
include various types of services, and it is likely that caregiv-
ers' experiences with the program are multifaceted as well
(Van Houtven, Voils, & Weinberger, 2011). The tool used in
the current study, the Aging and Disability Services­
Caregiver Appraisal Scale (ADS-CAS), assessed multiple
aspects of the caregiver experience. The ADS-CAS is based
on Lawton and Brody's(1969) Caregiver Appraisal Scale
(CAS) for the appropriateness of its language and its cover-
age of the broad scope of relevant caregiver experiences
(Vitaliano, Young, & Russo, 1991). The CAS was developed
on the basis of both successful scientific evidence and hands-
on experience. The details of the process of developing the
ADS-CAS were described in Chen (2009).
The ADS-CAS includes three subscales: Subjective
Burden (e.g., "Your health has suffered because of the care
you must give to care receiver" or "Very tired as a result of
caring for care receiver"), Caregiving Mastery (e.g., "I can
fit in most of the things I need to do in spite of the time taken
by caring for care receiver"), and Caregiving Satisfaction
(e.g., "Helping care receiver has made me feel closer to him/
her" or "Care receiver shows real appreciation of what I do
for her/him"). The ADS-CAS consists of 34 items, with 13
Chen 3
items, 12 items, and 9 items each for the Subjective Burden,
Caregiving Mastery, and Caregiving Satisfaction subscales,
respectively.
Participants responded to each item on the ADS-CAS
based on a 5-point scale, from rarely or never (1) to most of
the time (5). Higher total and subscale scores represent more
positive appraisals, except for the Subjective Burden sub-
scale, where higher scores indicate higher perceived subjec-
tive burden.
In addition to the three subscales, the ADS-CAS also sur-
veys information about caregivers' age, gender, and relation-
ship to the care recipient; the types of care provided; and the
types of caregiver support services used by the caregivers.
Agencies reported providing a list of services, including (a)
information about services, (b) assistance in accessing ser-
vices, (c) caregiver counseling, (d) caregiver education and
training, (e) financial assistance, (f) respite services/adult
day care, (g) help with housework, (h) delivered meals, (i)
transportation, and (j) cash support. Caregivers were asked in
the survey whether they had used each of these services.
These 10 types of caregiver support services were further
grouped in three categories: (a) counseling and education
services, (b) respite and supplemental services, and (c) finan-
cial support services. The counseling and education services
category includes information about services, assistance in
accessing services, caregiver counseling, and caregiver edu-
cation and training. The respite and supplemental services
category includes respite services/adult day care, help with
housework, delivered meals, and transportation. The finan-
cial support services category includes financial assistance
and cash support for caregiving. A general service satisfac-
tion question is also included in theADS-CAS, with a 4-point
scale response: poor (1), fair (2), good (3), or excellent (4).
After reverse coding and multiple imputation, Cronbach's
alphas for the ADS-CAS were .90. The power to detect sta-
tistically significant differences between male caregivers and
female caregivers was .72, and the power to detect differ-
ences between caregivers who reported having used at least
one service and those who reported not using any service
was .51 and .57 for male and female caregivers, respectively.
Details of the psychometric properties of ADS-CAS were
reported in Chen (2009).
Data Analysis
Data analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS-PC, Version 16.0). Prior to
analyzing the data, all items were examined to assess the
accuracy of variable calculations and missing values. If vari-
ables were missing at a rate larger than 5%, multiple imputa-
tion was applied (Rubin, 1977; Schafer, 1997, 1999, 2000).
Descriptive analyses were used to depict the characteris-
tics of the caregivers and the support services they used.
Three steps were included in the evaluation method. First,
we examined the gender differences in care provided and
services used using the t test. Second, we conducted
MANCOVA to examine gender difference, comparing ADS-
CAS scores between male and female caregivers (a) who
reported using any of the 10 caregiver support services, and
(b) who had used only one of the three categories of services.
Third, we conducted MANCOVA to examine gender differ-
ences by stratifying male and female caregivers and compar-
ing their appraisals in the following categories: (a) among
those who reported using any of the 10 services versus those
who did not; and (b) among those who used only one of the
three categories of services versus those who did not use that
particular service category. (For example, caregivers who
had used services in the financial services category only and
no services from other categories were compared with care-
givers who reported they had not used any services from the
financial services category. Caregivers who were "nonusers"
in one category may have used services in other categories,
or may have reported not using any services at all.) As rec-
ommended by Chen (2010), analysis is focused on categories
of service because analyses of individual types of service and
of the three service categories revealed similar findings.
Caregivers' age and the number of caregiving activities
they provided were controlled as covariates. The outcome
measures were (a) the item mean of the ADS-CAS; the item
means of each of the three subscales of the ADS-CAS: (b)
Subjective Burden, (c) Caregiving Mastery, and (d)
Caregiving Satisfaction; and (e) the caregivers' satisfaction
with the services they used.
Results
The survey response rate was 20.4% (177 questionnaires out
of 866). Five of the questionnaires were returned blank, and
two were returned with no information on ADS-CAS but text
information regarding their suggestions for future service
development only. Furthermore, six of the responding care-
givers stated that they were not providing any care at this
point, and 16 did not specify their gender. As a result, only
148 questionnaires were entered for quantitative data analy-
sis. About 81.7% of the responding caregivers were female
(n = 121), and 18.2% were male (n = 27). Their ages ranged
from less than 20 to more than 81 years old, with an average
age of 57. The average age of male caregivers (65.3 years)
was significantly older than the average age of female care-
givers (56.4 years). The majority of responding caregivers
stated that they were caring either for a spouse/partner
(48.8%) or for elderly parents (41.2%). Male caregivers were
more likely to care for a spouse/partner (64.3%) than for
elderly parents (32.1%), whereas a relatively equal percent-
age of female caregivers were caring for a spouse/partner
(39.2%) and for elderly parents (40.0%; see also Table 1).
About 70% of caregivers provided personal care, 98.2%
provided at least one type of instrumental activities of daily
living (IADL) care, and 86.6% provided at least three types
of IADL care. Caregivers provided from 1 to 10 types of care
4 SAGE Open
to their care recipients, with an average of 6.8 (SD = 2.24).
About one third provided all 10 kinds of caregiving activities
listed in the questionnaire. Male and female caregivers pro-
vided an average of 6.6 (SD = 2.17) and 6.8 (SD = 2.28)
types of care to their care recipients, respectively. The most
common type of care provided by male and female caregiv-
ers was different. The most common types of care provided
by male caregivers were medication monitoring (92%) and
financial management (77.8%); the most common types of
care provided by female caregivers were transportation
(85.1%) and financial management (77.7%). The percentage
of caregivers providing medication monitoring was signifi-
cantly higher among male caregivers than female caregivers
(p < .05). Among male caregivers, 92.6% provided medica-
tion monitoring, whereas only 76.9% of women provided
such care to their care receivers. The average number of
caregiving hours that the caregivers had spent in the previous
week was 73.54 hr (SD = 60.17), with an average of 46.29 hr
(SD = 37.53) for male caregivers and 78.26 hr (SD = 62.80)
for female caregivers (p < .05). Forty-three percent of male
caregivers provided more than 50 hr of care in the previous
week, whereas almost 58% of female caregivers provided
more than 50 hr of care in the week preceding the survey.
Caregivers reported using a range of zero to seven ADS
caregiver support services, with an average of 1.9 (SD =
1.54). Male and female caregivers used an average of 1.8
(SD = 1.47) and 1.9 (SD = 1.46) types of support services,
respectively. The services most commonly used by male and
female caregivers were information services (44.4% in male
caregiver vs. 54.5% in female caregivers) and respite ser-
vices (33.3% in male caregivers vs. 28.1% in female caregiv-
ers). The percentage of female caregivers receiving cash to
support caregiving was significantly higher than male care-
givers (p < .05). Five male caregivers (18.5%) and 16 female
caregivers (13.2%) stated that they had not used any services,
even though all the caregivers surveyed had been identified
by agencies as service recipients.
Gender Differences in the Scores of ADS-CAS
Both male and female caregivers reported moderate levels of
subjective burden, caregiver mastery, caregiver satisfaction,
and service satisfaction. After controlling for caregivers' age
and the number of care activities provided, there were no dif-
ferences between male caregivers and female caregivers in
the ADS-CAS measures or satisfaction toward services, with
one exception: Male caregivers perceived a lower subjective
burden than did female caregivers (p < .05; see Table 2).
Gender Differences in the Scores of ADS-CAS
Among Users
A comparison of male and female caregivers' ADS-CAS
scores among those who reported using at least one type of
support services (from here on referred to as caregiver users
vs. nonusers) revealed similar information as findings
reported above that male caregiver users, compared with
female caregiver users, perceived significantly lower subjec-
tive burden (p < .05). When male and female ADS-CAS
scores were compared by service category among those care-
givers who used a particular category of support services, the
data showed that male caregivers who used respite and sup-
plemental services reported better outcomes than did the
female caregivers who used the same service. Better out-
comes for male caregivers were found in several categories,
including better ADS-CAS score (p < .01), less subjective
burden (p < .01), better caregiving satisfaction (p < .05), and
better satisfaction toward the support services used (p < .05).
For the caregivers who used counseling and education ser-
vices, there were no differences between male and female

caregiver users'outcomes. No male caregivers used financial
support services, so outcomes for this category of support
services were not compared between male and female care-
givers (see Table 3).
Gender Differences in Mean Scores of Outcome
Measures (ADS-CAS) Between Users and
Nonusers of Services
Further analysis of use of caregiver support services between
users and nonusers of services revealed different outcomes
for male and female caregivers. Use of family caregiver sup-
port services seemed to result in more significant effects for
female caregivers than for male caregivers (see Table 3).
After controlling for caregivers' age and the number of care
activities provided, female caregivers who used at least one
type of service showed significantly lower scores in ADS-
CAS (p < .01), caregiver mastery (p < .05), and caregiver
satisfaction (p < .05) than did female caregivers not using
any service. For male caregivers, those who used at least one
type of service showed no difference in outcomes from those
who did not use any service.
An analysis of service categories revealed additional sta-
tistically significant relationships. The female caregivers
who used services in the counseling and education category
only perceived less subjective burden (p < .05) than did other
female caregivers. Female caregivers who used only respite
and supplemental services showed lower caregiver mastery
(p < .05) and caregiver satisfaction (p < .05) than did those
not using respite services. Last, female caregivers who used
only financial support services showed better appraisals
(higher total scores) on the ADS-CAS (p < .01), and per-
ceived greater caregiver mastery (p < .05) and caregiver sat-
isfaction (p < .01) than did those caregivers not using any
financial support services (Table 4). The results of our analy-
ses are presented in Table 4 as mean score differences
between users of services and nonusers, and between users
of a single service category and nonusers of that same ser-
vice category.
Discussion
The different findings reported by male and female caregiv-
ers adds to the growing body of research in caregiving sup-
port and provides suggestions for further service development
for male and female caregivers. In the current study, male
and female caregivers provided different types of care to
their care recipients and used different types of caregiver
support services. After controlling for caregivers'age and the
number of caregiving activities provided, the findings from
the current study reveal that gender differences played a role
in caregiver appraisals. Chen (2009) reported that use of dif-
ferent services was associated with different levels of care-
giver appraisal, and findings from the current study provide
further information regarding gender differences in caregiver
appraisals. In the following sections, we further discuss the
different outcomes associated with male and female caregiv-
ers' use of different caregiving support services.

Counseling and Education Services
Female caregivers seemed to benefit more than male care-
givers from using counseling and education services. In the
current study, female caregivers' subjective burden tended to
be higher than that reported by male caregivers, consistent
with reports from other studies that female caregivers per-
ceived greater strain and burden from caregiving than did
male caregivers (Kao, 2003; Kao & McHugh, 2004; Kramer
& Kipnis, 1995; Lawrence et al., 2002; Nagatomo et al.,
1999; Wallsten, 2000; Zahid & Ohaeri, 2010). This trend
remained among the caregivers in the current study who used
at least one type of support service and among those who
used respite and supplemental services but not any other type
of service. However, the discrepancy between male and
female caregivers' perceived subjective burden becomes
nonsignificant among caregivers who used counseling and
education category only. Further analysis revealed that
female users of counseling and education category only
reported a significantly lower subjective burden (p < .05)
than female nonusers, but no differences were found between
male users and nonusers. These findings could indicate that
use of counseling and education services is beneficial for
female caregivers, while the effect of using such services for
male caregivers is less obvious. Research findings have
shown that counseling and education services are effective in
helping caregivers deal with their own psychological needs
and improve their relationships with care recipients (Brodaty
et al., 2003; Burns et al., 2003; Coon, Thompson, Steffen,
Sorocco, & Gallagher-Thompson, 2003). The findings in the
current study support this previous research and further indi-
cate gender differences in outcomes of using counseling and
education services with further empirical evidences.
It is also important to note the possibility that female care-
givers who already perceive less burden may be more likely
to use this type of service. Those caring for a recipient with
more severe disabilities and those who have fewer sources of
caregiving help may perceive a higher burden and therefore
have less energy to use counseling and education services
(Markle-Reid & Browne, 2001; Toseland, McCallion,
Gerber, & Banks, 2002). However, a recent caregiver report
(AARP, 2009) showed that female caregivers who provided
care for more than 21 hr a week and who perceived a higher
caregiver burden were more likely to use counseling and
education services. The report also pointed out that female
caregivers are more likely than male caregivers to provide
intensive care and provide many hours of care (AARP, 2009).
Therefore, the findings from the current study may indicate
that female caregivers, more than male caregivers, become
more aware of their needs and seek counseling and education
services to support themselves to survive as caregivers.
Further study to establish a stronger causal inference is
merited.
Respite and Supplemental Services
Although male caregivers did not seem to benefit as much as
female caregivers from using counseling and education ser-
vices, they did seem to benefit from using respite and supple-
mental services. Among caregivers using respite and
supplemental services, male caregivers had higher scores on
the ADS-CAS, lower subjective burden, higher caregiver
satisfaction, and higher satisfaction toward the services they
used than female caregivers. In addition, male caregiver
users of respite and supplemental services showed better
caregiver mastery than male caregivers who did not use these
services. What we did not expect was that female caregiver
users of respite and supplemental services showed worse
caregiver mastery and caregiver satisfaction than did female
caregivers not using these services.
These findings could indicate that male caregivers enjoy
using respite services as a means of recharging themselves,
whereas female caregivers do not. If this is true, it could be
due to traditional role expectations for female caregivers.

Female caregivers are expected to be able to provide care
and comfort to their families (Navaie-Waliser et al., 2002).
Using respite services might make female caregivers per-
ceive themselves as incompetent. Providing female caregiv-
ers with extra counseling services along with respite services
may result in added benefits for female caregivers (Cox,
1997). Chen (2010) reported that caregivers who used respite
and supplemental services did not report any more positive
caregiver appraisals than nonusers did. The current study's
findings further indicate that male caregivers, but not female
caregivers, who use respite and supplemental services do
report more positive caregiver appraisals.
Financial Support Services
Female caregiver users of financial support services reported
higher scores on the ADS-CAS, higher caregiver mastery,
and higher service satisfaction than nonusers of such ser-
vices. There were no male caregivers in this study who used
this type of service. It could be that male caregivers are more
likely than female caregivers to be employed (AARP, 2004).
The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development (2011) reported evidence that caregiving leads
tolowerwages,especiallyforfemalecaregivers(Organisation
for Economic Co-Operation and Development, 2011).
Therefore, male caregivers may be more financially stable;
they may not need financial support services or may not even
be eligible to receive it. However, female caregivers are
more likely to need financial support services and may,
therefore, benefit more from this type of service. Providing
financial services to caregivers is likely to offer them the
opportunity to focus on their caregiving activities and to
develop higher confidence and satisfaction.
Feminist theory suggests that women have traditionally
been cast in the role of caregiver, as a result of traditional
gender roles and rigid family structures in which women
have been socialized to be responsible for various tasks
(Baines, Evans, & Neysmnith , 1991). From a feminist point
of view, providing financial support to caregivers could fur-
ther encourage women to fulfill their role as caregivers, and
thus perpetuate women's oppression (Mackinnon, 2009).
Our findings, showing better caregiver outcomes among
female caregivers who received financial support services,
provide empirical evidence that female caregivers perceive
higher confidence and satisfaction rather than oppression
when receiving financial support.
However, we should not ignore another possible explana-
tion--that the caregivers who were able to gain access to
financial support funds were competent users of the system
who already had higher caregiving mastery and total ADS-
CAS scores. Financial support for caregivers is a relatively
new service that has been developed in the last 15 years
(Doty, Jackson, & Crown, 1998). A limited number of
research studies have examined the effect of financial sup-
port services for caregivers, and none has looked how gender
differences influence use of these services (Eckert, Morgan,
& Swamy, 2004; Mahoney, Simon-Rusinowitz, Loughlin,
Desmond, & Squillace, 2004). The findings of this study
encourage further investigation of the cost-effectiveness of
providing financial support services to caregivers.
Furthermore, although eligibility criteria may prevent
male caregivers from using financial support services, both
the current study and a national caregiver survey report
showed that male caregivers are more likely than female
caregivers to help their care recipients with financial man-
agement (AARP, 2009). Exploring the possibility that factors
other than financial eligibility prevent male caregivers from
receiving financial support services could be important for
future research studies.
Limitations
Several methodological issues limit the findings in this study.
The cross-sectional design made it impossible to draw causal
inferences. The long and variable time between the time
caregivers received services and the time they responded to
the ADS-CAS is a threat to validity. We recommend that
future studies add a variable to assess the time between ser-
vice use and survey response. Moreover, past research has
found that caregivers' perceptions of distress may be influ-
enced by different factors at different stages of caregiving
(Vitaliano et al., 2002). Therefore, a longitudinal follow-up
would help to determine the optimal time to provide certain
kinds of services, and this information would be valuable for
future policy making.
Another limitation of this study was the low response rate
of 20.4%. We have explored potential reasons for the low
response rate. The first challenge is the fact that many care-
givers do not self-identify with the term caregiver. That is
possibly why five questionnaires were returned blank. Self-
identification has been a recurring theme and challenge for
implementing and evaluating family caregiver supports in
the United States (Feinberg & Newman, 2006). The low
response rate may also have to do with the substantial length
of the ADS-CAS questionnaire. Jepson and colleagues
(2005) studied the correlation between response rates and
questionnaire length and suggested that questionnaires above
a threshold of 1,000 words have lower response rates. Our
survey questionnaire was over 5,000 words, even after we
removed two subscales from the CAS.
Detailed information about care recipients was not col-
lected for the length of our questionnaire. This may limit the
generalizability of the study findings. We believe that the
characteristics of caregivers in the current study may be
close to the general caregiver population; the caregiver
demographics in the current study show similar composition
of age, gender, and number of services provided and received
compared with caregiver demographics in the National
Family Caregiver Study (AARP, 2004). There may well be
differences in other variables, of course. Increasing the
8 SAGE Open
response rate in future work will be important and can be
addressed by further decreasing the length of the question-
naire. Other methods that might increase the response rate in
future studies include offering incentive payments, or per-
forming follow-up.
Finally, the power to detect statistically significant differ-
ences between male caregivers and female caregivers in this
study was lower than .80. This could be due to the limited
number of male caregivers who responded to our survey.
With further analysis, we found that if the number of male
caregivers who claimed to receive services increased from
27 to 30, the statistical power to detect gender differences in
caregivers' experiences of using caregiver support service
would reach .81. Also, if the number of male and female ser-
vice nonusers increased to 17 and 36, the power to detect
differences between service users and nonusers would
increase and exceed .80 for both male and female caregivers.
The number of male caregivers who responded to our survey
was only about one fifth of our total study sample, which is a
little less than the proportion of male caregivers surveyed in
the AARP (2004) family caregiver survey. Although infor-
mation from male caregivers was limited, the message con-
veyed through our study findings are still valuable for future
family caregiver support services, especially for developing
gender-sensitive services. For future studies, oversampling
of male caregivers is recommended.
Conclusion
This study found gender differences in caregiver appraisal
scores that add to the growing body of research in caregiver
support and provide suggestions for further service develop-
ment. Not only did male and female caregivers report differ-
ences in caregiving activities and use of support services but
also responded differently to the support services they used.
The current study findings could shed some light on future
service development for caregivers of different genders. The
study's findings can also serve as a basis for more rigorous
future evaluations of caregiver support services.
