Body image dissatisfaction has been demonstrated to predict
poor psychological well-being and can precede the onset of
unhealthy eating behaviors in adolescence and adulthood
(Stice, 2002). Recent studies have examined the develop-
ment of body image dissatisfaction in young children, as it
may be a risk factor for the onset of unhealthy eating behav-
iors later on in life (e.g., eating disorders, obesity; Levine &
Smolak, 2005). Body dissatisfaction has been defined as dis-
pleasure with some aspect of one's appearance (Rosen,
1992), which can occur when perceptions of one's physical
attributes do not match the characteristics one would like to
possess (i.e., body image discrepancies). Evidence suggests
that children as young as 8 years report wanting to be thinner
than their current body sizes, wishing they weighed less, and
having tried dieting (Jung & Peterson, 2007; Robinson,
Chang, Haydel, & Killen, 2001). These data suggest that
even young children may be dissatisfied with their bodies.
As such, pediatric health care providers, health educators,
and parents should be aware of children's concerns; increased
awareness may improve the early identification of poten-
tially problematic body preoccupation and eating behaviors,
and allow for the utilization of early prevention and
intervention.
Children learn social norms associated with physical
attractiveness at a young age. Children as young as 7 years
reported that obese children have fewer friends, are lazier,
and are less attractive than nonobese children, whereas they
described their thinner peers as more likable, friendlier, and
more polite (Kostanski & Gullone, 1999). Children also
report wanting to be thinner than their actual body sizes,
wishing they weighed less, and having tried dieting (Rolland,
Farnill, & Griffiths, 1997). Therefore, it is not surprising that
even young children may be dissatisfied with their bodies.
Body image dissatisfaction increases with age for all chil-
dren, though girls report higher levels of dissatisfaction, more
concerns about dieting, and greater preoccupation with their
weight than boys do (Gardner, Sorter, & Friedman, 1997;
Lowes & Tiggemann, 2003; Phares, Steinberg, & Thompson,
2004; Wood, Becker, & Thompson, 1996). Gender differ-
ences in body image dissatisfaction have been found for chil-
dren as young as 8 years, but such differences appear to be
inconsistent or absent in younger children (Gardner et al.,
1997; Hendy, Gustitus, & Leitzel-Schwalm, 2001; Lowes &
Tiggemann 2003).

Assessing Body Image inYoung Children:
A Preliminary Study of Racial and
Developmental Differences

Stephen A.Wonderlich3
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine body image discrepancies in elementary-age children in a racially diverse sample.
Body image and body image discrepancy were measured in elementary school children (N = 58) of various racial groups (35%
Hispanic, 33% African American, 16% Caucasian, 14% other). Each participant was shown a set of silhouette figure drawings
and reported current and ideal body sizes. Children's body discrepancies appear to change between Grades 1 and 2. Notable
discrepancies between their current and ideal figures, and their current figure and those that they believe are most attractive,
are largely absent in Grade 1, but are evident in Grade 2 and older children. No substantive racial or gender differences in
body image perceptions or dissatisfaction were observed in this sample. Body image dissatisfaction may begin as early as
second grade in both girls and boys of various racial and ethnic backgrounds.These findings provide preliminary evidence that
body discrepancies may begin much earlier than previously thought.

One potential moderating influence on child body image
satisfaction is race. Most research on body image among
children utilizes Caucasian samples, with the few studies of
body image in children of different racial groups producing
inconsistent results (Edwards George & Franko, 2010). For
example, some studies suggested that Caucasian children
have more body image discrepancies than other racial groups
(Lawrence & Thelen, 1995; Thompson, Corwin, & Sargent,
1997), whereas others show children from various ethnic
groups (e.g., Caucasians, Hispanics, African Americans,
Asians) experience body discrepancies at similar rates
(Collins, 1991; Kelly, Bulik, & Mazzeo, 2011; Robinson
et al., 2001; Xanthopoulos et al., 2011). The limited and
sometimes conflicting literature on racial and ethnic differ-
ences in body image suggests the need for studies that con-
tinue to utilize diverse samples. Furthermore, research on
race effects are typically conducted with children in middle-
to-later childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood (e.g.,
Roberts, Cash, Feingold, & Johnson, 2006), which has led
researchers to call for the inclusion of minority groups in
studies of body image and disordered eating in young children
(Smolak, 2004; Striegel-Moore, 2001).
Additional studies clarifying the developmental timing of
body image dissatisfaction in children of various racial back-
grounds are needed. In a sample of racially diverse elemen-
tary school children, the present study cross-sectionally
assessed body image perceptions and discrepancies, as a
measure of body dissatisfaction. This study addressed three
primary questions: (a) "Do older children report larger (fat-
ter) body images and discrepancies than younger children?"
It was hypothesized that older children would select larger
body figures and report a larger discrepancy than younger
children. (b) "Do children of diverse racial backgrounds
report different levels of body image perception and discrep-
ancy?" No predictions about how racial groups may differ
were made because previous research is inconsistent on this
point. (c) "Do boys and girls in kindergarten through third
grade experience similar levels of body image discrepancy?"
Previous research suggests gender differences are apparent
beginning at about age 8, but there is more inconsistent evi-
dence in children younger than 8 (e.g., Gardner et al., 1997;
Hendy et al., 2001; Lowes & Tiggemann, 2003). As such, it
was hypothesized that younger boys and girls would report
more similar body image perceptions and discrepancies, and
that gender differences would not emerge until about Grade
2 (approximately age 8).
Method
Participants
Fifty-eight (29 males, 29 females) 5- to 11-year-old children
from urban elementary schools (kindergarten [K] to third
grade) were recruited to participate in this study. They were
from diverse ethnic backgrounds: 35% Hispanic (n = 20),
33% African American (n = 19), 16% Caucasian (n = 9),
and 14% "other" races, including mixed race (n = 8). Two
children did not report their race.
Measures
Demographics. Each child reported age, gender (boy/girl),
and race. Race was selected from Caucasian, African Ameri-
can, Asian, Hispanic, or "other" (including mixed race).
Figure Rating Scale. This measure consists of seven gender-
specific line drawings of increasing size, labeled from 1
(thinnest figure) to 7 (thickest/heaviest figure; Collins,
1991). Separate sets of figures corresponding to participant
gender were used for boys and girls. Respondents selected
figures that represent current body size and variations of
ideal body type. Discrepancy scores are calculated as the dif-
ference between current and ideal body types and are inter-
preted as measures of body dissatisfaction (Fallon & Rozin,
1985). Research shows young children of various racial
backgrounds can reliably complete this measure, and in a
sample of more than 1,000 first to third graders, a test­retest
reliability of r = .71 was demonstrated (Collins, 1991). This
Figure Rating Scale measure was selected because it is one
of the few measures that was developed specifically for chil-
dren that assesses self-reported body discrepancies without
requiring extensive child interviews. Previous studies have
found that children with larger body mass indexes (BMIs) or
heavier weights select larger current figures, suggesting they
are able to provide valid ratings of their current body figure
(Collins, 1991; Poudevigne et al., 2003; Rolland, Farnill, &
Griffiths, 1996). This effect does not vary by age, suggesting
children as young as 5 years can accurately select appropri-
ate figures (Williamson & Delin, 2001). The concurrent
validity for this measure has been demonstrated, with larger
discrepancies correlating with more dieting behavior
(Kostanski & Gullone, 1999) and lower self-esteem (Tigge-
mann & Wilson-Barrett, 1998) in children.
Procedure
The university's institutional review board and the elemen-
tary school administration approved this research. Informed
consent was obtained from participants' parents, and assent
was received from the children. During school hours,
research staff visited the children's classrooms. The children
individually met with researchers and completed the demo-
graphics questionnaire and Figure Rating Scale, and research
staff recorded participants' responses. On the Figure Rating
Scale, participants pointed to the figure they most looked
like (current body image), wanted to look like (ideal body
image), felt like (feel body image), and thought the opposite
sex would find attractive (i.e., what a boy/girl would think
was pretty/good looking; attractive body image). On com-
pletion of these measures, all children were thanked for their
participation and returned to their class.

General Analytic Approach
A MANOVA was used to appropriately handle the high
degree of relatedness among the body image variables and to
reduce the likelihood of Type I error that would result from
conducting numerous univariate statistical tests (Tabachnick
& Fidell, 2007). Two sets of MANOVA models were used,
and all analyses were conducted in the SPSS statistical pack-
age. In the first set of MANOVAs, the dependent variables
were the four body image perception measures (current,
ideal, feel, and attractive body image ratings), and in the
second set, the dependent variables were the three body
image discrepancy scores (ideal-current, feel-current, attrac-
tive-current). The independent variables were grade, race,
and the Gender × Grade interaction. Wilks's Lambda crite-
rion was used for all analyses, and significant multivariate
omnibus tests were followed up with univariate testing for
individual dependent variables (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007).
A p value of .05 was used for significance testing. This ana-
lytic approach provides information regarding whether chil-
dren's grade (as proxy for age), race, and gender influenced
their overall body image perceptions (across the four depen-
dent variables: current, ideal, feel, and attractiveness ratings)
and/or discrepancy scores (across three dependent variables:
ideal-current, feel-current, attractive-current discrepancies).
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Mean ratings corresponding to the four Figure Rating Scale
questions were calculated by the child's grade. These four
items (current, ideal, feel, and attractive) are measures of
body image self-perception, and three body image discrepancy
scores were then calculated from these perception ratings--
ideal minus current, feel minus current, and attractive minus
current--and provide an index of body image discrepancy
or dissatisfaction. Descriptive statistics for body image per-
ception scores (current, ideal, feel, attractive) and discrep-
ancy scores (ideal-current, feel-current, attractive-current)
are presented in Table 1 by grade level and in Table 2 by
race. The mean perception scores (current, ideal, feel, attrac-
tive) reflect the average figure children selected (on a 1-7
scale), with smaller numbers reflecting thinner figures. The
mean discrepancies are difference scores between children's
ratings of their current figure and the ideal, feel, and attrac-
tive figure ratings; negative discrepancies suggest a desire to
be thinner, and positive discrepancy scores indicate a desire
to be larger. All participants did not provide fully usable data
for each question; the actual number of children included for
each body image self-perception item and discrepancy is
indicated in Table 1.

HypothesisTesting
The effect of grade, race, and the Gender × Grade interaction
on body image perceptions and discrepancies were evaluated
to address the three hypotheses. The MANOVA analysis
revealed a significant multivariate omnibus effect of grade on
body image perceptions,  = .63, F(12,125) = 1.97, p = .03,
2 = .37, but not on body image discrepancies,  = .78,
F(9,117) = 1.42, p = .19, 2 = .22. Given the overall F test for
body image perceptions was significant, the multivariate
analyses were followed up with univariate analyses of the
individual dependent variables. There was a significant effect
of grade on ratings of current, F(3,50) = 4.97, p = .004, and
attractive figures, F(3,50) = 2.74, p = .05, but not on ideal,
F(3,50) = 0.68, p = .57, or feel body image ratings, F(3,50) =
2.44, p = .08. These results suggest that--using a continuous
grade variable--older children reported larger current body
figures and thought the other sex would find larger figures
more attractive, but grade had no overall effect on children's
ideal or feel figures, or body image discrepancy.
The mean discrepancy score ratings in Table 1 suggest
that a change in body image perceptions may occur between
Grades 1 and 2 because the ideal-current discrepancy goes
from 0.80 (indicating children want to be larger than their
current figure) to -0.38 (suggesting they want to be thinner).
To explore this relationship further, post hoc analyses with a
recoded grade variable were conducted, comparing children
in Grades K and 1 to Grades 2 and 3. Table 3 presents the
means and standard deviations for the self-perception and
discrepancy scores. Independent sample t tests were used to
evaluate for differences in ratings between younger (Grades
K-1) and older children (Grades 2-3). As is presented in
Table 3, older children selected large current body figures,
reported they felt larger, and thought the opposite sex would
find larger figures more attractive than younger children;
there were no significant differences in older and younger
children's ratings of their ideal figure. Regarding the body
image discrepancy scores, results showed children in Grades
2 and 3 wanted to be significantly thinner than their current
(ideal-current discrepancy) and thought the opposite sex pre-
ferred thinner bodies (attractive-current discrepancy) than
did children in Grades K and 1. These data provide evidence
that in this diverse sample, body image discrepancy, or dis-
satisfaction, may emerge between Grades 1 and 2 (or approx-
imately around age 8).
The second question this study aimed to address was
whether racial background differentially influenced body
image perceptions or discrepancy. No specific predictions
about whether children from different racial backgrounds
perceive their bodies or discrepancies differently were made
because of limited and inconsistent findings from previous
research.
Results of the multivariate omnibus test showed that there
was no effect of race on body perceptions,  = .75, F(12,119) =
1.16, p = .32, 2 = .25, or discrepancies,  = .78, F(9,112) =
1.36, p = .22, 2 = .22. These findings suggest that, in this
sample, children of all races perceived their bodies and dis-
crepancies in similar manners.
Finally, this study examined whether there was a Gender ×
Grade interaction. Based on previous research, it was expected
that younger boys and girls would report similar body image
perception, but that discrepancy and gender differences
would emerge after approximately age 8, with girls showing
larger discrepancies than boys (i.e., an interaction of grade
and gender). The results did not confirm this prediction; the
omnibus multivariate test was nonsignificant for both body
image perceptions,  = .78, F(12,114) = 0.93, p = .52, and
discrepancies,  = .90, F(9,107) = 0.53, p = .85, 2 = .10.
These results suggest that boys' and girls' body image devel-
opment show similar trajectories in this diverse sample.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to examine body image discrep-
ancy in a young, ethnically diverse sample of children. It is
important to describe body image and body image discrep-
ancy in children at a young age to provide a better under-
standing of the ways in which children's early distortions in

self-perception may be related to the onset of unhealthy
attitudes and behaviors toward eating, food, and their bodies
in later childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Although
this study used a relatively small sample of young children,
the findings are generally consistent with previous research
examining body image concerns in older, less ethnically
diverse samples (Jung & Peterson, 2007; Robinson et al.,
2001; Rolland et al., 1997). This study provides preliminary
evidence that body discrepancies may develop at a very
young age, highlighting the importance of considering body
image concerns in children in both research and practice.
There is consistent evidence indicating that body dissatis-
faction in older children (at least 11 years old) is a risk factor
for the development of eating problems (Levine & Smolak,
2005), and the present findings suggest that dissatisfaction
may develop at a much younger age. In particular, the direc-
tion of body image discrepancy effects were different in
younger and older children, suggesting a desire to be heavier
(bigger) early in grade school (Grades K-1) and thinner later
in grade school (Grades 2-3). One possible explanation for
this difference is that during middle and later childhood,
sociocultural factors (e.g., media, peers, parents) have been
shown to affect children's body image perceptions and satis-
faction (see Levine & Smolak, 2005, for a review of socio-
cultural influences on body image). For instance, in children
as young as 9, appearance-related media exposure and peer
conversations have been shown to be negatively associated
with body esteem and body dissatisfaction (Clark &
Tiggemann, 2007). It is less clear whether and how sociocul-
tural factors influence younger children, although there is
some recent evidence that appearance messages from the
media and peers may not affect very young children (ages
3-6; Hayes & Tantleff-Dunn, 2012). Although this explana-
tion for the present findings is speculative, it suggests that
future research examining the influence of sociocultural fac-
tors on body perceptions and discrepancies in young children
is warranted. The findings from such studies could help to
elucidate the role of sociocultural factors and, in particular,
determine the age at which these factors begin to influence
children's body image perceptions and discrepancies, and
may affect the risk trajectory for subsequent psychological
or physical health conditions.
The racial diversity of the current study's sample allowed
for a preliminary examination of racial differences in body
image. Previous research suggests that Caucasian children
want to be thinner (Lawrence & Thelen, 1995) and that
African American children want to be heavier (Thompson et
al., 1997). In the present sample, which was composed pri-
marily of Hispanic and African American children, no racial
differences were seen. Although racial differences in the
desire for thinness may be evident later in childhood, at a
very young age, this may not be the case. This study provides
preliminary evidence that, in young children, body image
concerns may be relevant for racial groups (e.g., African
American) that were not previously considered prone to
body image dissatisfaction. As such, the demographic fac-
tors associated with higher levels of body image dissatisfac-
tion in older children and adults (e.g., Caucasian, female,
adolescent) may have more limited applicability in very
young children. As was demonstrated in the present study,
body image concerns are beginning to present in younger
boys and girls from diverse backgrounds than previously
thought, and this issue clearly warrants future research
attention.
Although the findings of the present studies are prelimi-
nary, they do provide initial evidence that body image dis-
crepancies can be detected in children at a young age and
thus there may be opportunity for intervention. An associa-
tion between body image discrepancy and psychological
well-being has been demonstrated in adolescents and adults
(Stice, 2002), however, considerably fewer studies have
examined this issue in young children. Identifying and pro-
viding intervention for children who experience body dis-
crepancies may provide an opportunity to prevent or mitigate
more serious behavioral (e.g., unhealthy eating behaviors),
psychological (e.g., eating disorders, mood disorders), or
health issues (e.g., obesity), which are known to be associ-
ated with body image concerns (Stice, 2002; Xanthopoulos
et al., 2011).
Despite the important contributions of this study, includ-
ing the use of very young children and a racially diverse
sample, as with any study, there are limitations. First, this
was a preliminary research study using a relatively small
sample of young children. Although the findings are gener-
ally consistent with previous studies using less diverse sam-
ples, it is possible that some effects--particularly regarding
racial and gender differences--were not detected due to the
small sample size. This was a pilot study and thus general-
izing to larger populations should be done with great caution.
Second, this study used a child figure drawing measure for
the assessment of body image discrepancies. Criticism in the
literature regarding the reliability of these measures in chil-
dren under the age of eight have led to the suggestion that
they should not be used (Smolak, 2004). However, empirical
work has also demonstrated that children as young as six can
accurately report on their health and well-being if the mea-
sure is appropriately adapted and simple questions are used
(Forrest, Riley, Vivier, Gordon, & Starfield, 2004). The mea-
sure used in the present study asked children four short ques-
tions (e.g., "Which drawing looks the most like your body
now?") in an attempt to make the questionnaire administra-
tion as simple and straightforward as possible. Furthermore,
in the present study, older children selected larger current
figures than younger children, and previous research has
demonstrated that children with larger BMIs or heavier
weights select larger current figures (Collins, 1991;
Poudevigne et al., 2003; Rolland et al., 1996), suggesting (at
least in part) that they understand the appropriate use of this
measure. Importantly, this study should be viewed as pre-
liminary work that encourages future research addressing the
6 SAGE Open
issue of body image dissatisfaction in young children, and
the resulting psychological and health concerns.
This study adds to the growing literature that body image
perceptions and discrepancies can develop at a young age in
both boys and girls in a diverse sample of children. However,
as has been noted throughout, the present findings are pre-
liminary work and should ideally be used to encourage addi-
tional research on this important topic. Future research
should include prospective evaluations of the relationship
between body image discrepancies, dissatisfaction, psycho-
logical well-being (e.g., self-esteem, depression, anxiety),
developmental processes (e.g., physical maturation), and
physical health (e.g., eating/exercise habits, appropriate
growth) in young children.
