Measurement of Assistive Device Use:
Implications for Estimates of Device
Use and Disability in Late Life
Jennifer C. Cornman, PhD,1 Vicki A. Freedman, PhD,1 and Emily M. Agree, PhD2
Purpose: This study systematically reviews ap-
proaches that national surveys have used to measure
the use of assistive devices and examines the
implications of these different approaches for preva-
lence estimates of device use and disability in late
life. Design and Methods: Cross-sectional data from
six national surveys are used to compare rates of
assistive device use and disability among community-
dwelling adults aged 65 and older. Results: Esti-
mates of the use of any device are similar across
surveys, ranging from 14% to 18% for the population
of adults aged 65 and older. However, one survey
design element--the restriction of device-use ques-
tions to those reporting difficulty with daily activities--
omits a potentially sizeable group: those who use
devices but report no difficulty. Including this group of
device users significantly increases the prevalence
estimates of both device use and disability. Impli-
cations: The use of assistance and perceptions of
difficulty are inextricably interwoven, and attention to
the measurement of these concepts is needed. Survey
designers may want to consider asking questions
about assistive device use independent of questions
about difficulty. In addition, researchers who study
disability may want to consider including those who
report using devices but no difficulty, a group that
may become more prevalent as new cohorts age.
Key Words: Disability, Assistive devices, Survey
design
Tracking late-life-disability trends has become an
increasingly important topic of interest to researchers
(e.g., Crimmins, Saito, & Reynolds, 1997; Freedman
et al., 2004; Freedman & Martin, 1998; Freedman,
Martin, & Schoeni, 2002; Manton, Corder, &
Stallard, 1997; Manton & Gu, 2001; Schoeni,
Freedman, & Wallace, 2001; Waidman & Liu,
2000). The studies concerning these trends suggest
that the prevalence of functional limitations (such as
having difficulty bending, reaching, or stooping) and
difficulty with routine tasks such as shopping,
cleaning, and managing money (instrumental activ-
ities of daily living, or IADLs) declined for older
Americans during the 1980s and 1990s (Freedman
et al., 2002). In the 1990s, declines also occurred in
the prevalence of difficulty with and the receipt of
help for personal care activities such as bathing, dres-
sing, and walking (activities of daily living, or ADLs),
although trends in the use of personal care or assistive
technology to meet ADL needs have been relatively
flat (Freedman et al., 2004).
At the same time, the relative importance of
assistive devices (also referred to in the literature and
surveys as assistive technology, special equipment,
or aids) in meeting the needs of the older population
has been increasing. Nearly two thirds of older
Americans with an ADL disability use one or more
assistive devices to meet their needs (Agree &
Freedman, 2000), and this estimate increased during
the 1980s and 1990s (Freedman et al., 2004; Manton,
Corder, & Stallard, 1993; Spillman, 2004). The
prevalence of the use of assistive devices is likely to
rise further as the number and types of devices
available increase. In the past 20 years alone, the
number of assistive devices has expanded from 6,000
products (U.S. Congress Office of Technology As-
sessment, 1985) to over 29,000 products (National

Studies of disability trends have relied almost
exclusively on self-reported measures from national
surveys. Although potential sources of bias in
disability trends have been explored in systematic
reviews (e.g., Freedman et al., 2002), the various
approaches to measuring assistive device use and
their influence on disability prevalence rates has not
been investigated. Our purpose in this article is to
describe the range of approaches that national sur-
veys employ to measure assistive device use; inves-
tigate how prevalence estimates of assistive device
use by older Americans are influenced by survey
design features; and explore how analytic decisions
about the inclusion of assistive device measures may
affect estimates of late-life-disability prevalence.
Background: Approaches to Defining
and Measuring Disability
Unlike measures of disease, disability is socially
defined, representing the intersection of an individu-
al's abilities, her or his social and physical environ-
ment, and the demands of daily tasks (Agree, 1999).
Conceptually, a person experiences a disability when
the demands of a given context (environment and
task) do not match her or his physical, cognitive, and
sensory capabilities. Given these complexities, the
lack of agreement about optimal measures of
disability (Altman, 2001) and the wide variation of
measures appearing in the late-life-disability litera-
ture are not surprising.
At least three general approaches to defining the
prevalence of late-life disability have appeared in the
literature. The first considers those who have
difficulty with daily tasks, most often in the absence
of accommodations (e.g., without help or equip-
ment), as having a disability. The second approach
classifies those needing or getting personal care as
having a disability. Less common is a third approach
that categorizes people who use any assistance--
either personal help or assistive devices--in daily
activities as having a disability.
Figure 1 illustrates how these various measure-
ment approaches overlap. The largest circle repre-
sents the population that reports difficulty with daily
activities in the absence of help or equipment. The
circles drawn with dotted and dashed lines represent
the populations using assistive devices and getting
help from another person, respectively. Although the
illustration here is for a hypothetical population, one
can imagine that the size of the circles as well as the
extent of overlap will vary by key demographic
characteristics, particularly age.
As Figure 1 shows, people who report having
difficulty also may report the use of assistance--
either an assistive device, or help from another
person, or both. However, restricting the definition
of disability to the population that reports difficulty
omits a potentially important group: those who use
either assistive devices or personal help or both but
who report no difficulty with a task. This group may
use devices (e.g., a cane) as a prophylactic measure,
perhaps to avoid falling or to increase security.
Alternately, they may be so successful in adapting
with the device that they perceive no difficulty
whatsoever. Regardless of the reason, they do not
associate performance of the task with difficulty.
Surveys sometimes embed questions about assistive
device use within questions about difficulty with
ADLs, effectively restricting the assistance questions
to those reporting difficulty and eliminating this
group a priori. For this group, the use of assistance,
like behavioral changes that are made to accommo-
date daily activities, may signal what has been
referred to as preclinical disability (Fried, Bandeen-
Roche, Chaves, & Johnson, 2000; Pine, Gurland, &
Chren, 2002).
The figure also illustrates that restricting the
definition of disability to the population getting
personal help excludes two potentially important
groups receiving assistance: those who have difficulty
and bridge that difficulty with only assistive devices
and those who use devices for reasons other than
difficulty (e.g., safety or convenience). Whether these
so-called omitted groups have similar characteristics
as those receiving personal help is unclear; one might
hypothesize that they are likely to differ because they
have accommodated their difficulty (or if not their
difficulty, their situation) independently, without
human assistance.
In sum, two common approaches to measuring
disability--defined either as having difficulty or as
receiving help--potentially omit relevant groups of
individuals who use assistive devices to carry out
their daily tasks. In this article, we explore both types
of omissions and their implications for estimates of
assistive device use and of disability prevalence.

uals who have difficulty, get help, or use assistive devices to

Methods
Data
We compare estimates of assistive device use
across the following six national surveys, using the
latest available wave of data: the 2002 National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the 2000 Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the 2001 Survey
of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the 2000
Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), the 1999
National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS), and
the 2001 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
(MCBS). Although not all of the surveys focus on
the older population, they all include samples of older
adults and questions about late-life disability, in-
cluding measures of difficulty and forms of assis-
tance. Even so, each survey serves multiple purposes
and, therefore, the amount of detail collected on these
topics is limited and varies. In the following analyses,
we limit samples from each survey to the community-
dwelling population aged 65 and older. (See Table 1
for additional details on each survey.)
Missing Data.--We treat missing data on device
use or disability consistently across all surveys. Data
can be missing on the device-use questions primarily
for two reasons: (a) the survey design skipped
a respondent around the device-use questions; and
(b) a respondent did not provide an answer to the
question(s). For respondents who were skipped
around the device-use questions, we assume that the
respondents do not use any assistive devices.
For item nonresponse (e.g., don't knows or re-
fusals), we also assume that respondents are not
using the devices in question. In the NHIS core,
HRS, MEPS, NLTCS, and MCBS, this affects less
than 0.7% of cases included in the samples from
these surveys. In the NHIS disability supplement,
about 2% of cases are missing on the device-use
question, and we assume that these individuals are
not using any devices. In the SIPP, there are no
missing data in the public release file because an
imputation procedure is used to assign values to
missing data. Approximately 8% of cases have
values imputed for the device-use questions. Results
are unaffected if cases with item nonresponse or
imputed data are dropped.
We use a similar strategy for dealing with missing
data on the disability questions. If a respondent does
not provide an answer to a disability question, we
assume that the respondent does not have a disability.
In the MEPS, NHIS, and HRS, less than 0.1% of
cases are missing on the disability items and about
8% of cases in the SIPP have imputed data. In
addition, in the HRS, respondents who report no
functional limitations, or one functional limitation
and no difficulty dressing, are skipped around
questions about difficulty with walking or trans-
ferring, the measures of disability examined here. We
assume that these respondents do not have difficulty
with these activities (disability data from the NLTCS

Methods
First, we discuss differences in the design and
wording of the surveys. Following this, for each
survey, we present the weighted percentage of those
aged 65 or older and those aged 85 or older who use
any assistive device, assistive devices for specific
ADLs (mobility, bathing, toileting, transferring,
eating, or dressing), and individual devices (wheel-
chair and walker, cane, or crutches).
Next, we explore the implication for estimates of
assistive device use of restricting device-use questions
to those reporting difficulty. Using data from the
HRS, we test differences in device-use rates esti-
mated with and without restriction on difficulty.
We then use four surveys to explore the implica-
tions for disability rates of excluding (a) those who
use assistive devices but report no difficulty (SIPP and
HRS) and (b) those who use devices but report no
help (MEPS and NHIS). In both cases we show the
unadjusted rate excluding the group in question and
the adjusted rate when the omitted group is added to
the estimate, and we use t tests to examine differences
in rates.
Finally, we explore the characteristics of the two
excluded groups by using chi-square tests to indicate
significant differences in rates across demographic
groups (age, gender, race, marital status, and
education). We also use multinomial logistic re-
gression models with SIPP and HRS data to estimate
models with a three-category outcome: (a) reports
no difficulty and does not use devices; (b) reports no
difficulty but uses devices; and (c) reports difficulty
(the reference group). We estimate a second set of
models with the MEPS and NHIS for the outcome:
(a) gets no personal help and does not use devices;
(b) gets no personal help but does use devices; and
(c) gets personal help (the reference group). Predic-
tors include age (60­74, 75­84, and 85þ), gender, race
(Black, White, or other), marital status (married or
unmarried), and education (less than high school,
high school education, or more than high school).
We exclude cases missing on these predictors from
both the bivariate and the multivariate analyses.
We drop approximately 0.5% of the cases in the
HRS, 1.8% in the MEPS, and 1.7% in the NHIS (data
not shown).
Results
Differences in Survey Design
There are three primary survey design elements
related to measuring device use that differ across the
six surveys examined: (a) whether questions about
assistive devices are restricted to those reporting
difficulty with ADLs; (b) whether questions focus on
device use for specific activities or device use more
generally (global), regardless of the tasks for which
they are used; and (c) whether questions focus on
individual devices or the use of any device (any use).
There also are some potentially important question-
wording differences, including a reference to a time
period for use (e.g., use last week or use now) and the
terminology used to refer to assistive devices (e.g.,
special equipment, aids, technology, equipment).
Table 2 outlines the salient features of the device-use
questions for each of the surveys. Actual question
wording appears in Appendix A.
Restricting Device-Use Questions.--Surveys dif-
fer in regard to which respondents are asked
questions about the use of assistive devices. Of the
surveys reviewed, one asks questions about device
use only to respondents who self-report having
difficulty with functioning (HRS), and another limits
detailed questions to those reporting a chronic
problem with one or more daily activities (NLTCS).
A third survey (MCBS) restricts questions about
device use for a specific activity to those reporting
difficulty with that specific activity. The three
remaining surveys (NHIS, MEPS, and SIPP) do not
impose any restrictions.
Question Focus: Activities.--A second difference
is in the activities on which questions focus. Three
surveys (HRS, NLTCS, and MCBS) ask about device
use for specific tasks, and the other three (NHIS,
MEPS, and SIPP) focus on use more generally,
without reference to specific activities. Two surveys
(NLTCS and MCBS) ask about equipment used to
help in performing all ADLs, and one (HRS) limits its
questions about device use for walking and trans-
ferring. The global questions vary in terms of how
devices are referred to and what kinds of activities are
mentioned. (Mentioned activities are, e.g., usual
activities in the NHIS disability supplement, personal
care or everyday activities in the MEPS, and no
specific activities in the SIPP or NHIS core; see
Appendix A for details.)
Question Focus: Devices.--Finally, surveys also
differ in whether they record specific types of devices
or any use. Three surveys (NHIS, MEPS, and MCBS)
record any use (the latter for each activity). The other
three surveys record more detailed information. The
NLTCS and HRS, for example, ask respondents to
name the type of device used for each activity,
whereas the SIPP asks explicitly whether the re-
spondent uses ``a wheelchair or scooter'' or ``a
walker, cane, or crutches.'' Among the surveys that
record more detail, there is variation in the items that
are recorded and whether items are grouped together.
350 The Gerontologist
Prevalence Estimates Across Surveys
The first three rows of Table 3 show the
prevalence estimates of the use of any device. We
derived these estimates in slightly different ways
and are thus shown on different rows. Estimates
from the NHIS (core and disability supplement) and
the MEPS are from a single question about the use
of any assistive device. We derive the HRS, NLTCS,
and MCBS estimates by summing across the use of
devices for specific ADL tasks. The SIPP estimate
includes those that report using a wheelchair or
scooter or a walker, cane, or crutch.
Despite the differences in measurement and differ-
ences in the way prevalence is derived, estimates of
the use of ``any assistive device'' are remarkably
similar. Between 14% (NLTCS) and 18% (SIPP and
NHIS, both the core and the disability supplement) of
those aged 65 and older and between 39% (NLTCS
and MCBS) and 44% (SIPP and NHIS Core) of adults
aged 85 and older use one or more assistive devices.
The middle panel of Table 3 provides task-specific
estimates of device use. Estimates are in general quite
similar across surveys for the population aged 65 and
older, but they vary a bit more for some activities for
the 85 and older population. For example, estimates
of device use for bathing (6.5% to 8.5%), toileting
(3.2% to 4.9%) and transferring (5.1% to 5.9%) are
quite similar for the 65 and older population, but the
percentage of the 85 and over population using
devices ranges from 16% to 24% for bathing, from
8% to 15% for toileting, and from 12% to 20% for
transferring. There are two exceptions for this
general pattern. First, estimates vary for both age
groups for indoor mobility (8.1% to 14.6% and
24.9% to 40.3%, for the 65 and older and 85 and
older populations, respectively). The indoor mobility
estimates come from only two surveys--the HRS and
NLTCS--which use different screening approaches
and different questions (see Table 2 and Appendix
A for details). Second, estimates for using devices
for eating and dressing are quite low (less than 1.5%)
and quite similar within each age group.
The bottom panel of Table 3 shows the frequency
of use of specific devices. Although the HRS and
NLTCS collect information on the use of additional
devices, in the SIPP, wheelchairs, walkers, canes, and
crutches are the only devices about which data are
collected. (The NHIS, MEPS, and MCBS do not ask
questions about specific devices.) Results show that
from 2% (HRS) to 5% (SIPP) of the population
aged 65 and older and from 6% (HRS) to 11% (SIPP
and NLTCS) of the population aged 85 and older
use wheelchairs. Between 11% (NLTCS) and 17%

eIn the HRS, the response category is wheelchair­cart, and in the SIPP it is wheelchair-scooter.
fThe HRS and NLTCS record the use of these devices separately, but the SIPP response category is ``a walker, cane of crutch.''
352 The Gerontologist
(SIPP) of those aged 65 and older use a walker, cane,
or a crutch, and between 32% (NLTCS) and 41%
(SIPP) of those aged 85 or older use one or more of
these devices.
Restricting Assistive Device Use Questions:
Effect on Device-Use Prevalence Estimates
The left-hand side of Table 4 cross-tabulates the
HRS device-use questions and questions about
difficulty with daily activities (see Appendix B for
wording of difficulty questions). The right-hand side
demonstrates how estimates of device use are affected
when questions about device use are restricted to
those reporting difficulty. The first row shows that
9% of those individuals aged 65 and over who report
having no difficulty walking across a room also
report using indoor-mobility equipment. If these
respondents were excluded from the use questions (as
they would be if the device-use questions were
restricted to those reporting difficulty), the estimates
of using equipment for walking across a room would
be cut in half. That is, only 6.3% would be identified
as using indoor-mobility devices compared with
14.6% when no restriction is imposed. The rate of
using transferring equipment also would be cut
nearly in half if transferring-device-use questions
were restricted to those reporting difficulty trans-
ferring (2.6% with restriction vs 5.1% with no
restriction).
The bottom panel of Table 4 demonstrates the
effect of restricting the device-use questions for
estimates of the use of specific types of devices.
Among older adults reporting no difficulty with
walking or transferring, 8.3% (2.4 million people)
report using a device for those activities; the majority
of these individuals use canes (80% or about 1.9
million people). Restricting the device questions to
those reporting difficulty lowers the prevalence
estimates of any device use by about half, from
15% to 7.6%, largely as a result of the exclusion of
these cane users. Estimates of cane use would be
reduced by more than half (from 10.4% with no
restriction to 4.5 %) and wheelchair use by about one
fourth (from 2.3% to 1.8%).
Combining Assistive Device Use
With Rates of Difficulty and Help
Table 5 shows the potential effects of combining
estimates of assistive device use with rates of dif-
ficulty and of getting personal help. The left side
illustrates the changes in disability rates that result
from augmenting difficulty responses with informa-
tion about assistive device use. In the SIPP, for
example, 6.5% of the population aged 65 and older
report having difficulty getting around inside. An
additional 13.1% of individuals report using a device
but have no difficulty. By including these respond-
ents, the percentage of individuals with an indoor-
mobility disability would triple. In the HRS, results
for walking across the room are similar, with the
combined estimate of having difficulty or using a
device (16.3%) double the estimate of those reporting
difficulty (8.0%). The combined estimate for trans-
ferring is 8.8% compared with 6.2% for the estimate
based only on difficulty.
The right side of Table 5 illustrates the effects of
combining estimates of assistive device use with rates
of getting personal help (see Appendix B for the
wording of help questions). About 6% of respondents
aged 65 or older report receiving (MEPS) or needing

(NHIS) help with personal care activities. Estimates
of assistive device use without help range from
roughly 12% to 14%.Combining the percentage of
individuals reporting help with the percentage of
individuals reporting device use leads to estimates
that are nearly triple those of help alone (18.0% to
20% vs. 6%).
Identifying Those Reporting Device
Use but no Difficulty or Help
The top panels of Table 6 shows, for several
demographic groups, the percentage of individuals
who report no difficulty but use devices for several
mobility-related tasks. Older respondents, women,
Blacks, those who are not married, and respondents
with less than a high school education are more likely
to be in this group for getting around inside (SIPP
and HRS), walking (SIPP), and transferring (HRS).
Similarly, the percentage of individuals who report
using devices but not help (MEPS, NHIS) is higher for
older respondents, women, Blacks, unmarried indi-
viduals, and those with less than a high school
education (bottom panels, Table 6).
Table 7 shows the odds of reporting device use
but no difficulty relative to reporting difficulty (col-
umn 2 of each model). The associations between the
demographic variables and the likelihood of using
devices and reporting no difficulty vary across sur-
veys and activities, showing few consistent patterns.
The one consistent finding across surveys and
activities relates to education. Those with more
than a high school education are from one third more
likely to twice as likely as those with less than a high
school education to report no difficulty but use
a device for a mobility-related activity.
The associations between demographic character-
istics and the odds of reporting device use but no
help, relative to reporting help (column 2 of each
model in Table 8), vary across surveys and tasks.
Nevertheless, two consistent results emerge. The
relative odds of reporting device use but no help is
lower for two groups: the oldest old (aged 85þ)
compared with those aged 65 to 74, and those of
other races (not Black or White) compared with
Whites. These results suggest that approaches that
use questions about help to identify the older
population with disability tend to omit younger in-
dividuals who are White.
Discussion
Our purpose in this study was to gain a better
understanding of the implications of assistive-device
measurement for estimates of device use and
disability in late life. Survey-design elements related
to measuring assistive device use differ in three
primary ways across national surveys: (a) restricting

questions about assistive devices to those reporting
difficulty with daily activities; (b) focusing questions
on devices used for specific activities versus device
use more generally; and (c) focusing questions on
individual devices versus the use of any device.
Despite these differences, the estimates of the
prevalence of any device use were quite similar,
ranging from 14% to 18% for the 65 and older
population.
In addition, both device use and disability esti-
mates are affected when device-use questions are
asked only of those reporting difficulty with daily
tasks. For example, by restricting questions to those
reporting difficulty with mobility-related tasks, thus
omitting those individuals who use devices but report
no difficulty, our results show that estimates of device
use would be half as large. If estimates of disability
were based on difficulty or device use, that is,
included those individuals who use devices but report
no difficulty, the prevalence of disability would be up
to three times as large as estimates based on difficulty
alone. Finally, results showed that individuals who
report no difficulty but use devices for mobility tend
to be highly educated, and the majority of these
individuals report using a cane.
Estimates of disability based on receiving or
needing help also are influenced by device use.
Combining estimates of those individuals using
devices with those getting help increases estimates
nearly threefold compared with rates of those persons
getting help alone. Furthermore, younger individuals
(aged 65­74) and Whites have greater odds of using
devices but not help compared with getting help.
This study has several limitations. First, we could
not definitively assess the amount of bias introduced
into assistive device use and disability estimates by
restricting questions about device use to those
reporting difficulty. Although we contrasted esti-
mates of difficulty and device use for mobility-related
activities, whether these differences hold for other
activities is unclear. Moreover, in some cases we
assumed that the devices (e.g., wheelchair or walker,
cane, or crutch) were used for all mobility-related
activities across settings. Finally, neither of the two
surveys used to assess this bias unambiguously
measures difficulty without the use of assistive
devices: the SIPP question specifies that users of
assistive technology report difficulty when they use
their equipment, but without personal help (see
Appendix B), and the HRS measures of difficulty do
not make reference to assistance at all, leaving up to
the respondents whether they report their difficulty
with or without assistance (see Appendix B). This
implies that some proportion of the gap between
reports may include satisfied users of technology who
experience no difficulty when using their devices.

Taken together, these limitations suggest that the
difference between the older population with
disabilities defined purely with difficulty questions
and the population defined with a combination of
difficulty and device use is likely sizeable, but just
how large is unknown. Had a true measure of
underlying difficulty been available, the combined
rates of difficulty and device use may not have been
as large as shown here.
A related limitation is that we were unable to
explore whether task-specific, global, or detailed
device-use questions provide similar estimates of
the prevalence of assistive device use. For this issue
to be explored further, a survey that measures
devices by using more than one approach is needed.
A study now underway to create an instrument for
national surveys to measure assistive-technology
use and effectiveness is being funded by the
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in
cooperation with the National Institute on Aging
and the National Center for Health Statistics. The
new instrument, developed with input from policy
makers, researchers, and extensive cognitive testing
by the National Center for Health Statistics, will be
piloted with a purposive sample of 300 individuals
aged 50 and older. Both global and detailed items
will be included and use will be assessed across
multiple tasks.
Despite these limitations, our results have impor-
tant implications for survey designers interested in
measuring device use and disability among older
Americans. Our results suggest that a nontrivial
proportion of older adults use devices but report no
difficulty with daily tasks, and that these individuals
are more highly educated than those reporting
difficulty. Future studies might explore a number
of possible explanations for such discrepancies,
including the relationship among reports of device
use, underlying disability dynamics, the physical,
cognitive, and mental status of individuals, and
perceptions about ability and independence. To
facilitate these explorations, survey designers may
want to consider asking questions about assistive
technology independent of questions about diffi-
culty and give researchers the option of studying
further the personal characteristics and social and
environmental conditions of this group. Qualitative
interviews also may add to our understanding of
how these individuals perceive their situations and
why they report using devices but not difficulty.
Researchers interested in studying older Ameri-
cans who use assistive devices may find reassuring
the finding that national estimates fall within
a relatively narrow range. However, despite the
fact that the estimates are similar, it is possible that
different approaches to identifying assistive device
use may capture different groups of users. An
important next step will be to investigate the
reliability and validity of the various approaches
identified here--global, task specific, or device

specific--and to better understand whether the
various approaches identify similar populations.
Finally, researchers who study disability may want
to consider including those who report using devices
but no difficulty or no help. These individuals are
important to consider because, as a younger and
more educated group, they may represent the
patterns of adaptation new cohorts will make as
they age. Whether this group should appropriately be
included in estimates of the older population with
disabilities, however, raises questions about where
the clinical threshold for disability should be set in
national estimates. It may be more appropriate to
include this group along with those making behav-
ioral accommodations in the population with pre-
clinical disability (Fried et al., 2000).
Evidence suggests that the number of older adults
using assistive devices has been steadily growing over
time (Freedman et al., 2004; Manton et al., 1993;
Spillman, 2004); whether this trend reflects changes
in underlying health (e.g., decreasing levels of
disability), changes in the propensity to turn to
devices instead of human care (i.e., increasing
acceptance of technology), changes in the availability
of personal care, or changes in the desire to maintain
independence is still unclear. What is clear is that the
use of assistance and perceptions of difficulty and
ability are inextricably interwoven, and more atten-
tion to the measurement of these concepts, and to the
implications of measurement techniques for our
estimates of disability in the older population is
warranted.
