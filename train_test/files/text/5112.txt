Abstract
Objective: To assess medication literacy status and to examine risk factors of inadequate
medication literacy of outpatients in ambulatory care settings.
Methods: Study participants were recruited randomly from outpatient departments in four
tertiary hospitals (Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Second Xiangya Hospital of
Central South University, Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, People's
Hospital of Hunan Province) in Changsha, Hunan, China, between October 2014 and January
2015. Medication literacy was assessed using the Medication Literacy Scale, Chinese version.
Demographic and clinical data were collected using structured interviews. Multiple logistic
regression analysis was used to estimate the independent effects of demographic and clinical
factors on medication literacy.
Results: Of 465 participants, 425 (91.4%) produced valid responses for analysis. The mean
medication literacy score was 8.31 (standard deviation ¼ 3.47). Medication literacy was adequate in
131 participants (30.8%), marginally adequate in 248 (58.4%), and inadequate in 46 (10.8%). The
risk of inadequate medication literacy was greater for older and unmarried patients but lower for
more educated patients.
Conclusion: Many Chinese outpatients in ambulatory care have inadequate medication literacy.
Greater age, low education, and unmarried status are important risk factors of inadequate
medication literacy.

Introduction
Nearly half of global medication use is
irrational.1 According to the Institute of
Medicine, 1.5 million adverse drug events
are reported in the United States annually
and half a million of these occur in non-
hospitalized patients.2 In China, between
12% and 30% of medication use in patients
is irrational.3 Moreover, about 25% of
patients in China visit physicians because of
adverse events; at least 2.5 million patients
are admitted to hospital because of adverse
drug events each year,4 a trend that is
increasing.5 Previous studies have found
that a lack of close compliance with doctor's
orders after hospital discharge is caused,
at least in part, by a lack of medication
literacy.6­8 Medication literacy has been
defined as the ability of individuals to
access, to appropriately understand, and to
adequately act on basic medication informa-
tion, and to make the right decisions accord-
ingly.9,10 It is an important predictor of
correct medication use.9,10 Research on the
medication literacy status of non-hospitalized
patients in China is sparse. Therefore, we
conducted this study to assess medication
literacy status and to examine risk factors of
inadequate medication literacy in a cohort of
outpatients in China.
Patients and methods
Patients
Outpatients from four tertiary hospitals
(Xiangya Hospital of Central South
University, Second Xiangya Hospital of
Central South University, Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, and
the People's Hospital of Hunan Province,
each with > 500 inpatient beds) in
Changsha, Hunan, China, were invited to
participate between October 2014 and
January 2015. Participants' written
informed consent was obtained. We
obtained approval from the ethics board of
each participating hospital before the study
began. The eligibility criteria for participa-
tion were as follows the following: older
than 18 years, competent language commu-
nication ability, mentally stable, and cur-
rently taking at least one medication.
Exclusion criteria included the following:
inpatients, engaged in health care-related
work currently or before retirement, men-
tally unstable or major mental disorder, and
cancer or other severe systemic diseases that
affect participation.
Data collection
Demographic and clinical data were
collected using structured interviews.
Medication literacy was assessed using the
Chinese version of the Medication Literacy
Scale (MedLitRxSE). This scale was origin-
ally developed by Sauceda et al.9 from the
University of Texas at El Paso in the United
States.10 The scale consists of four case
scenarios, with 14 items and a dichotomous
scoring system (correct, 1; incorrect, 0). The
maximum scale score is 14; higher scores
indicate greater medication literacy.
According to the principle of calculation
formula of the distinction degree, which is
used in the educational statistics, the scores
were classified into three groups: inadequate
literacy (<4), marginal literacy (4­10), and
adequate literacy (>10). We obtained per-
mission from Sauceda et al.9 to translate the
scale into Chinese and modified it to suit the
304 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
Chinese culture. The validity and reliability
of the Chinese version of the MedLitRxSE
has been published elsewhere.11 In brief, the
Chinese version has validity and reliability
equivalent to the original English version,
with internal consistency reliability (the
Kuder­Richardson Formula 20 ¼ 0.81).
The confirmatory factor analysis indicated
overall good model fit: the root mean square
error of approximation was 0.08, 2/df
was 3.06, Bentler's comparative fit
index was 0.94, and the goodness of fit
index was 0.91.11
Data analyses
SPSS version 19.0 (2010, IBM Corp.,
Armonk, New York, United States) was
used for all analyses. Descriptive statistical
analyses were used to analyse demographic
information. We used t-tests, analysis of
variance, and the Kruskal­Wallis H test for
the univariate analysis. Logistic regression
analysis was used to analyse the independent
effects of determinants of medication
literacy.
Results
A total of 465 outpatients were enrolled in
the study; of these, 425 (91.4%) completed
the questionnaires and were included in the
final analysis. The basic characteristics of
respondents who completed the study are
shown in Table 1. Of the 425 participants,
62.8% were male and 16.2% were not
married.
Medication literacy of outpatients
Of the 425 participants, 248 (58.4%) had
marginal medication literacy, 46 (10.8%)
had inadequate medication literacy, and 131
(30.8%) had adequate medication literacy.
The assessment of medication literacy by
case scenario is shown in Table 2. For Case
Scenario 1, 27.7% of participants did not
know how many times their mother should
inject the required medication and less than
half (48.3%) knew where their mother
should inject the medicine. For Case
Scenario 2, 48.9% of the participants knew

Table 4 shows the results of the multiple
logistic regression analysis. Three factors
showed an independent association
with inadequate medication literacy. The
risk of inadequate medication literacy was
greater for older and unmarried patients,
but lower for those with more education.
Discussion
Our study of a cohort of outpatients in
China showed that medication literacy was
poor: only 30.8% of the study participants
had adequate medication literacy. Analysis
by case scenarios revealed some disturbing
findings: about half the outpatients did not
have detailed knowledge of some aspects of
medication, such as dosage (50.2%), side
effects (45.8%), and injection sites (51.7%).
We found that older age (>55 years) was
independently associated with increased risk
of inadequate medication literacy. This
finding is consistent with results from studies
of other populations.12­14 As patients age,
their cognition, learning, and memory abil-
ities deteriorate.15,16 Our findings indicate
that greater education is associated with
better literacy. This is inconsistent with
findings from a report by Maniaci et al.7
This may be because we had a greater
percentage of participants with low educa-
tion than Mania et al.7 As a result, our study
may have greater power to detect the effect
of education on medication literacy. Our
findings also showed that married patients
had greater medication literacy. We could
not identify any previous studies on the
association between marital status and
medication literacy. We suggest that married
couples provide each other with support,
which enhances their medication literacy.
Lack of medication literacy exposes out-
patients to increased risk of re-hospitaliza-
tion, emergency department visits, or
serious consequences owing to adverse
events related to unsafe medication.15,17
Medication literacy could be improved
by patient education. Adequate and effective
communication about medication between

patients and health care professionals is a
key factor in improving literacy.13,18
As patients sometimes cannot remember
detailed medication information and guid-
ance verbally communicated by physicians,
the provision of comprehensible, written,
educational material on medication might
help. In addition, follow-up after discharge
could remind patients to pay more attention
to their medication.
Our study has several strengths. First, to
our knowledge, this is the first study to
examine outpatient medication literacy in
mainland China. Second, we identified sev-
eral risk factors of medication literacy,
including unmarried status, which has not
yet been identified as a risk factor in the
literature. Third, we used a validated tool to
assess medication literacy.
This study has some limitations. First,
data were collected from four tertiary hos-
pitals in Changsha. Further studies are
needed to determine whether findings from
this population can be generalized to popu-
lations in other parts of China. Second, the
sample size was not sufficiently large, which
prevented us from performing more refined
analyses, such as item-specific analysis, or
examining potential interactions among risk
factors.
In conclusion, we found that the medica-
tion literacy in outpatients in China was
generally low, and older age, lower educa-
tion, and unmarried status were independ-
ent risk factors of inadequate medication
literacy. Although prescription drugs are
regulated in China, enforcement of these
regulations is often weak, and patients or
their relatives can obtain prescription drugs
such as antibiotics from local drug stores
without a doctor's prescription. Therefore,
patient education to improve medication
literacy is an important issue in mainland
China.
