Death rarely results from only one cause, and it can be caused by a variety of factors. Multiple cause-of-death
data files can list as many as 20 contributing causes of death in addition to the reported underlying cause of death.
Analysis of multiple cause-of-death data can provide information on associations between causes of death, re-
vealing common combinations of events or conditions which lead to death. Additionally, physicians report the
causal train of events through which they believe that different conditions or events may have led to each other and
ultimately caused death. In this paper, the authors discuss methods used in studying associations between
reported causes of death and in investigating commonly reported causal pathways between events or conditions
listed on the death certificate.

Death certificate data are generally analyzed by examin-
ing the underlying cause of death as reported on the death
certificate by the medical examiner (1). However, deaths
rarely have only one cause, and this method does not allow
researchers to assess the role of conditions that were impor-
tant contributors to death but were not reported as the un-
derlying cause. Multiple cause-of-death (MCOD) data offer
an alternative. MCOD data specify the underlying cause of
death but also include data on other contributing causes of
death (2). Thus, more complete information on factors and
diseases causing death can be utilized.
MCOD data can be useful in a number of ways. In this
paper, we focus specifically on the utility of MCOD data for
the analysis of associations between causes of death. We
describe methods that can be used to test associations be-
tween conditions in MCOD data and to suggest possible
causal relations. In order to provide examples of the types
of analyses we describe, we refer to our previously pub-
lished analysis of the 114,380 deaths reported in the United
States from 1990 to 2001 in which pressure ulcers were
listed as a cause of death in MCOD coded data (3).
FREQUENCIES AND ODDS RATIOS
The simplest analysis of association between conditions
in death certificate data involves examining the frequency
with which two conditions are reported together. For exam-
ple, an analysis of all 114,380 death certificates listing pres-
sure ulcers as a cause of death reveals that septicemia is also
reported on 45,374 (39.7 percent) of these death certificates.
Since this percentage is far higher than we would expect to
see among decedents without pressure ulcers, we may con-
clude that some association between pressure ulcers and
septicemia is present in death certificate data.
However, it may not always be clear whether the percent-
age of death certificates reporting comorbidity is different

than we would expect. For example, 46,714 (40.8 percent)
death certificates that report pressure ulcers as a cause of
death also report heart disease as a cause of death. This
figure is not substantially higher or lower than we would
expect, so it is difficult to discern whether or not an associ-
ation exists between reporting of pressure ulcers and report-
ing of heart disease in death certificate data.
In order to solve this problem, we can conduct a case-
control study comparing deaths from the condition of
interest with deaths from other conditions. The use of mortal-
ity odds ratios (MORs) and exposure odds ratios (EORs) in
case-control studies with mortality data is preferable to the
traditional use of the proportional mortality ratio (4). The
MOR and EOR differ in that the MOR assumes the condi-
tion (pressure ulcers) used for case/control selection to be
the outcome, while the EOR assumes it to be the exposure.
In our data, we suppose that if a causal association exists
between pressure ulcers and septicemia, pressure ulcers will
act as the exposure and septicemia as the outcome. Thus, in
order to calculate an MOR, we would have to use septicemia
deaths as cases and choose nonsepticemia deaths as con-
trols. In contrast, if we wanted to calculate the EOR, we
would compare pressure-ulcer-associated deaths with a con-
trol sample of non-pressure-ulcer-associated deaths. The
difference between the MOR and the EOR is largely a dif-
ference of terminology. Although the two figures are calcu-
lated using different sampling procedures, they are
estimates of the same quantity. Thus, the MOR and the
EOR will differ only to the extent that error is present in
the selection of controls, and controls may be selected ran-
domly so that the difference between MOR and EOR re-
flects only random error. Additionally, when testing possible
causal associations between causes of death, it is not possi-
ble to prove which variable is the outcome and which is the
exposure. Thus, the terms MOR and EOR reflect a re-
searcher's educated guess as to the direction of causation
in the analysis being performed. To the extent that EOR and
MOR differ, it is not possible to know which figure is pref-
erable to use unless additional information is present. How-
ever, we mention the difference between MOR and EOR
because correct identification of the exposure variable in
case-control studies can be important in identifying poten-
tial confounders for stratification and in the selection of
appropriate controls (4).
Stratification may be necessary to modify crude MOR
and EOR figures because persons who die of pressure ulcers
may be different in a number of ways from decedents with-
out pressure ulcers. For example, they will probably be older
and thus more likely to be reported as suffering from heart
disease. The presence of factors, such as age, which exert an
effect on the exposure (heart disease) and are related to the
outcome (pressure ulcers) may introduce confounding. Var-
ious methods of stratification are available to control for
confounding, including the use of the standardized mortality
odds ratio (5). However, we focus here on the use of
matched comparisons because of their utility even when
data are sparse in some strata. In matched comparisons,
a matched control is selected for each case from other deaths
that are similar to the case with respect to age, sex, race/
ethnicity, or any other factors for which we desire to control.
Matched mortality odds ratios (mMORs) or matched expo-
sure odds ratios (mEORs) are then calculated in order to
estimate the magnitude of the association between the con-
ditions. While the selection of matched controls does not
control for confounding on its own, the calculation of
mMORs (or mEORs) does. mMORs (and mEORs) treat
each individual matched pair as a single stratum and intro-
duce stratification by the variables used in the matching
process.
As with odds ratios in other types of matched pair studies
(6, 7), matched statistics are calculated by examining dis-
cordant pairs, where either the case is exposed and the con-
trol is unexposed or the case is unexposed and the control is
exposed (see table 1).
The following equations are used (6, 7):
mMOR ¼ mEOR ¼ B=C
and
Var½lnðmMORÞ ¼ Var½lnðmEORÞ ¼ 1=Bþ1=C:
In our sample of pressure-ulcer-associated deaths (3),
matched exposure odds ratios confirm our suspicion that
a strong association exists between reporting of pressure
ulcers and reporting of septicemia in death certificate data
(mEOR ¼ 11.3, 95 percent confidence interval: 11.0, 11.7).
In contrast, a negative association was found between re-
porting of pressure ulcers and reporting of heart disease
(mMOR ¼ 0.5, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.5, 0.5).
INTERPRETING STATISTICAL COMPARISONS
Generally, when we speak of two conditions as being
``associated'' with each other, we mean that the presence
of one condition indicates a higher or lower probability that
the other condition will also be present. However, physi-
cians filling out death certificates only report conditions that
they believe were instrumental in causing death. They do not
report all prevalent conditions. Thus, death certificate data
cannot indicate whether septicemia is more likely to be
present in decedents with pressure ulcers than in decedents
without them. They can only indicate whether septicemia is
more likely to act as a cause of death when pressure ulcers
are also a cause of death than when they are not. This in-
formation has real clinical significance, suggesting the im-
portance of septicemia prevention and treatment in persons
with pressure ulcers as a mechanism for preventing death.
However, associations in death certificate data should not be

interpreted as reflecting associations in the general popula-
tion. It is possible that persons in the general population
with pressure ulcers are more likely to have or develop
septicemia, but death certificate data do not measure the
prevalence of either condition and can only provide indirect
support for such a theory.
Additionally, selection bias can threaten the validity of
inferences derived from a case-control study. Selection bias
may arise when both outcome and exposure status influence
the inclusion of subjects in a study. In case-control study
designs, an association necessarily exists between the out-
come and selection, since subjects are enrolled in the study
on the basis of their disease status. Consequently, any asso-
ciation between exposure status and selection will lead to
selection bias. In order to be included in a case-control study
of mortality data, a person must have died. Thus, any expo-
sure that increases the likelihood that someone will die
also increases the likelihood that the person will be included
in the study, generating a type of selection bias termed
Berksonian bias (5). For example, suppose an investigator
were interested in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
as a potential risk factor for heart disease and sought to
estimate the association between these conditions using
death certificate data. Persons would initially be included
in the study based on the presence of heart disease on the
death certificate, creating an association between heart dis-
ease and selection. In addition, persons with the exposure,
HIV, would also be more likely to be included in the study,
since HIV infection increases the likelihood that a person
will die. This would probably cause persons with HIV to
be overrepresented in death data relative to the general
population.
Since most medical conditions listed on death certificates
ought to have contributed to death, it is reasonable to expect
that some level of Berksonian bias will operate in nearly all
associations estimated between causes of death listed on
death certificates. Berksonian bias can be limited, however,
by selecting controls who died from conditions thought to
be unassociated with the exposure. A second form of selec-
tion bias known as detection bias (8) can occur if the expo-
sure and outcome conditions are thought to be associated. In
this case, persons with the exposure condition may be more
likely to be tested for the outcome condition and thus will be
more likely to be identified as cases in the study.
Death certificate data may also be affected by reporting
bias. At the simplest level, reporting bias may result from
incorrect diagnoses' being recorded on the death certificate.
However, a more systematic type of reporting bias is also
possible. In our data, the number of death certificates that
recorded both septicemia and pressure ulcers as causes of
death may be an artifact, in part, of common medical opin-
ions among physicians filling out death certificates. The bi-
ologic plausibility of a connection between pressure ulcers
and septicemia is high. Thus, a physician filling out a death
certificate for a person who died of septicemia and had
a severe pressure ulcer might mistakenly assume that both
conditions contributed to death. The opposite can also oc-
cur; most conditions (such as heart disease in the example
above) are not thought of as being associated with the de-
velopment or progression of pressure ulcers. Even if both
heart disease and pressure ulcers were important contribu-
tors to death, physicians may be unlikely to list heart disease
and pressure ulcers on the same death certificate, simply
because of the low biologic plausibility of the two condi-
tions' acting in concert to cause death.
In the case of models using a matched design, a special
type of selection bias known as overmatching bias may be
present (4). While matching on true confounders will not
cause this type of bias, matching on any factor which is af-
fected by the exposure variable and is related to the outcome
variable may introduce overmatching bias, and in some sit-
uations this bias cannot be eliminated analytically. Thus, it
is important to select matching variables carefully. The com-
mon use of demographic variables such as age, race, and sex
for matching should not introduce overmatching bias, since
these variables are unlikely to be affected by the exposure.
CAUSATION AND ENTITY AXIS CODES
While matched odds ratios are unable to indicate causal
relations between conditions, epidemiologic methods of
causal inference are available (8, 9). Some types of evidence
typically used to imply causation (such as a dose-response
relation or temporality) cannot be examined using death
certificate data, but others can. The strong biologic plausi-
bility of a causal relation between pressure ulcers and sep-
ticemia provides some evidence that the association we
observed may be causal. Additionally, the strength of the
relation (mEOR ¼ 11.3, 95 percent confidence interval:
11.0, 11.7) suggests that it could not have resulted from
weak or moderate biases alone (however, strong biases
may exist in death certificate data).
In addition to standard epidemiologic methods of causal
inference, death certificate data contain information on the
supposed causal train of events leading to death, as reported
by the physician. The US Standard Certificate of Death has
two sections in which cause-of-death data can be entered
(figure 1). In part I, the physician is asked to describe the
causal train of events which led to death. The condition
reported on line a of part I is the immediate cause of death,
the last condition in the causal train of events leading to
death. It is caused by the condition or event (if any) reported
on line b, which in turn is caused by the condition or event
(if any) reported on line c.
This information is recorded in MCOD data in the entity
axis code variables (10). Entity axis codes provide research-
ers with International Classification of Diseases codes for
the conditions or events reported in part I and also note
which line of part I the physician originally used to report
each condition or event. Thus, in the above example, if a
pressure ulcer is reported on line b and septicemia is re-
ported on line a, we may suppose that the physician believed
the pressure ulcer to be a cause of septicemia, which in turn
caused death. Entity axis data are not always clear. While
only one condition should be reported per line in part I, this
rule is not always followed. For example, a physician may
report ``septic pressure ulcer infection'' on line a of part I. In
this case, both septicemia and pressure ulcers will be coded
in MCOD data as having been entered on line a and it will

not be possible, using the data alone, to determine the causal
relation between the two. In our data, 1,072 (3.0 percent)
deaths were identified for which pressure ulcers and septi-
cemia were indicated on the same line of the death certifi-
cate, such that the direction of causation was unclear.
However, in 33,102 (94.0 percent) of the 35,215 cases where
pressure ulcers and septicemia were both listed in part I,
septicemia was listed as being ``due to or a consequence
of'' pressure ulcers. It is unlikely that such a strong trend
would be observed by chance alone.
However, causal pathways reported in entity axis codes
only reflect physicians' best judgment about the causal train
of events. It is not possible, using death certificate data, to
determine which criteria the physician used to infer causa-
tion. The physician may have reasoned incorrectly or may
have had insufficient information with which to adequately
assess the causal train of events leading to death, and there-
fore caution must be exercised.
In certain cases, we may be able to recreate and validate
the physician's process of causal inference with a reasonable
degree of certainty. For example, in 490 of the 498 (98.4
percent) cases for which multiple sclerosis and pressure
ulcers were both reported in part I of the death certificate,
pressure ulcers were reported as being a result of multiple
sclerosis. It is reasonable for a physician to assume that
a person with an incapacitating case of multiple sclerosis
would not have developed a severe pressure ulcer in the
absence of multiple sclerosis. However, in some cases, the
physician's process of causal inference may be unclear, or it
may even be apparent that the physician's reporting cannot
reflect true causation. Six death certificates were found in
which multiple sclerosis was reported as having resulted
from pressure ulcers. Current medical knowledge suggests
that this is unlikely, and so few physicians reported this
causal pathway that it is quite possible they did so uninten-
tionally. To the extent that physicians' reasoning is unclear
or seems incorrect, causal pathways reported in entity axis
codes should be given less credence.
While part I of the death certificate only allows for the
reporting of a single train of events leading to death, cau-
sality may be extremely complicated in real situations.
Deaths may be caused by multiple trains of events which
may or may not converge. Thus, physicians are also pro-
vided with part II (figure 1), in which they can record other
conditions or events that contributed to death but were not
listed in part I. It is not possible to establish a causal relation
between these conditions and those reported in part I,
though such a relation may exist. Of the 45,374 death cer-
tificates that listed both pressure ulcers and septicemia as
causes of death, either pressure ulcers or septicemia was
listed only in part II for 10,159 (22.4 percent), such that
no causal relation was indicated.
Additionally, data from entity axis codes are recoded to
generate record axis code variables. While entity axis codes
reflect data originally reported by the examiner, record axis
codes reflect ``cleaned'' data, in which some conditions are
recoded to better match the context of other conditions or
events reported on the death certificate (11). For example,
suppose that a medical examiner reports both alcohol de-
pendence syndrome and cirrhosis of the liver without men-
tion of alcohol as a cause of death. Both conditions will be
shown in entity axis code data. However, in record axis code
data, they will be replaced with a single condition: alcoholic
cirrhosis of the liver. Unfortunately, record axis code data do
not reflect the position in which conditions are recorded in
the causal train of events leading to death.
CONCLUSIONS
Like all data, death certificate data are imperfect, and it is
important to understand their limitations before attempting
to interpret associations observed in the data. Multiple

sources of bias exist, and it is not possible to check the
accuracy with which data were recorded or to easily access
supplemental data, such as decedents' medical histories,
that would potentially shed light on information recorded
in death certificate data.
However, while caution should be used in examining as-
sociations observed between conditions in MCOD data, the
data are still of considerable value. MCOD data are free and
provide an easily available source of population-based infor-
mation on causes of death and associations between causes of
death. While studies utilizing death certificate data cannot
prove the existence of causal relations, entity axis code data
provide an additional source of information on the causal
pathways physicians believe to have resulted in death.
