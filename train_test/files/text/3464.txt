Big Data in the 1800s in surgical science:
A social history of early large data set
development in urologic surgery
in Paris and Glasgow
Dennis J Mazur
Abstract
``Big Data'' in health and medicine in the 21st century differs from ``Big Data'' used in health and medicine in the 1700s
and 1800s. However, the old data sets share one key component: large numbers. The term ``Big Data'' is not synonymous
with large numbers. Large numbers are a key component of Big Data in health and medicine, both for understanding the
full range of how a disease presents in a human for diagnosis, and for understanding if one treatment of a disease is better
than another treatment or better than just leaving the patient on his or her own without therapy. In this paper, we
examine the first considerations of Big Data in medicine in Paris in the early 1800s when urologic surgeon Jean Civiale
collected the first large numbers. Civiale collected the large numbers to defend the efficacy of his urologic instrument,
the lithotrite, and the surgical procedure he developed, lithotrity, for the removal of bladder stones compared with
earlier, more invasive surgical approaches. We examine how large numbers were adjudicated in social decision-making in
the Acade
´mie des sciences, Paris, when a dispute arose among French urologic surgeons about the importance of large
numbers in surgical science. After Civiale's successful defense of his instrument and procedure in Paris, we examine how
his approach to Big Data (large numbers) impacted data collection by George Buchanan in his use of the procedure at the
Royal Hospital Infirmary in Glasgow.

Introduction
In this paper, we will examine Big Data of the 1800s in
Paris and Glasgow as it was adjudicated in surgical
science in a dispute among French urological surgeons.
This scientific dispute focused on a new urological sur-
gical instrument and procedure whose use had spread
across Europe. The data adjudicator and interpreter in
this case was a commission selected by the Acade
´ mie
des sciences, Paris.
The term ``Big Data'' today is typically defined in
terms of algorithmic processes carried out by com-
puters. For example, the Oxford Dictionary (2014)
defines ``Big Data'' in the area of computing specifically
as ``data sets that are too large and complex to manipu-
late or interrogate with standard methods or tools.''
However, these types of large data sets have existed in
many eras prior to the invention of computers to carry
out algorithmic processes. Our focus in this paper will be
on large numbers--as viewed by urologic surgeons and
statisticians in the 1800s--as a component of Big Data.
Before computing by machine, when one computed
only by hand or in one's head, the term of probabilistic
and statistical importance was ``large numbers.'' The
recognition for the need for large numbers first came
about in science, but not in the medical or surgical

sciences, rather in arguments in astronomy. In 1755,
Thomas Simpson commented on the need for large
numbers in astronomical observations:
It is well known that the method practiced by astron-
omers, to diminish the errors arising from the imper-
fections of instruments, and of the organs of sense, by
taking the mean of several observations, has not been
so generally received, but that some persons of note
have publicly maintained, that one single observation,
taken with due care, was as much to be relied on, as the
mean of a great number.
Simpson (1755) further argued that ``the more obser-
vations of experiments there are made, the less will the
conclusion be liable to err, provided they admit of
being repeated under the same circumstances.''
In 1837, Simeon Denis Poisson, also an astronomer
but foremost a statistician interested in applying prob-
abilistic models to data outside of astronomy, developed
his law of large numbers and encouraged surgeons of his
day to study large numbers of patients. This was neces-
sary in probability and statistics, as Simpson (1755)
notes, ``. . . to diminish the error arising from the imper-
fections of instruments, and of the organs of sense.'' We
are interested in the examination of the first large data
sets used in surgery and of how the Acade
´ mie des
sciences used ``Big Data'' in France in the 1800s.
Surgeons have a long history of accumulation of
survival versus mortality data in the use of new surgical
instruments and procedures for operations. This is par-
ticularly true in the military, as many new instruments
and procedures are invented and used for the first time
in wartime (Vekerdy, 2005), for example, involving bal-
listic trauma to the abdomen (Mahoney et al., 2005)
and temporary vascular shunts in damage control in
wartime vascular injury (Britt et al., 2002).
Jean Civiale (1792­1867), a urologic surgeon in
Paris, developed and maintained one of the largest
data sets on a particular instrument (the lithotrite)
and procedure (lithotrity) during peacetime. Early
instruments for the removal of small stones from the
bladder through the urethra included the urethra-for-
ceps of Sir Astley Cooper and Sir Benjamin Brodie
(Hawkins, 1864). Civiale studied under Dupuytren
and won prizes from the Acade
´ mie des sciences in
1827 (6000 Francs) and 1829 (1000 Francs) for his lith-
otrity procedure (Haydn, 1841). Lithotrity involved
``bruising,'' ``crushing,'' or otherwise fragmenting a
bladder stone for removal through the urethra without
cutting through the bladder wall. The uniqueness of the
lithotrity procedure was its less invasive nature in
removing stones from the bladder compared with lith-
otomy (cutting through the bladder wall) (Herr, 2009;
Kiefer, 1968).
Civiale's data set
As a surgeon with a new surgical instrument and a new
procedure, Civiale kept track of his urologic cases that
distinguished his instrument and procedure from his
predecessors and contemporaries. This approach was
a necessity in Paris in the early 1800s, as the
Acade
´ mie des sciences had a strong role as an adjudi-
cator of disputes among physicians and surgeons
regarding the assessment of newly developed surgical
instruments and procedures aimed at replacing older
instruments and procedures for the same or similar
surgical problem.
In its role as an adjudicator of disputes among phys-
icians and surgeons, the Acade
´ mie des sciences served
an early regulatory function in French society by bring-
ing the typical ``physician versus physician'' and
``surgeon versus surgeon'' disputes before experts com-
missioned by the academy. In the case of the Civiale
instrument, the lithotrite, and his procedure, lithotrity,
Civiale had what were then considered to be large num-
bers at hand to defend his procedure. The Acade
´ mie
des sciences selected experts to evaluate Civiale's pro-
cedure, including those from the field involved in the
dispute and Poisson, the main statistical expert of
the time.
Poisson, although first interested in the develop-
ment, refinement, and application of mathematical
models to the prediction of the orbits of the planets,
also recognized that these mathematical models could
be used in other realms of government in a variety of
ways. Yet, Civiale's numbers in terms of his own per-
sonal data, supported by data from urologists across
Europe, demonstrated that his less invasive procedure,
lithotrity, had a much lower relative risk of the patient
dying than lithotomy in all its forms, including the
Marian operation, the Allarton operation, and others
(Gant, 1878).
Jacobson's and Heurteloup's instruments to break
down the stone were replacing Civiale's method of per-
forating (drilling) of the stone in the bladder. Also, the
operations and the instruments themselves were becom-
ing more simplified and lithotrity was replacing the ear-
lier complicated apparatuses. At the time, problem
patients were men with prostatic hypertrophy that
would either have retained fragments of the stone in
the bladder or have fragments lodged in the prostatic
portion of the urethra.
Parisian urological surgeons disparaged Civiale's
instrument and procedure and took their case to the
Acade
´ mie des sciences for adjudication and evaluation
(Crosland, 2002). Writing in 1837, Lee et al. note
that lithotrity (with an instrument inserted into the
bladder) was replacing lithotomy (the cutting of the
bladder for stone removal in a surgical operation)
2 Big Data & Society
throughout Europe, although at the time, the authors
did not know if the lithotrite and its procedure, lithot-
rity, admitted to such a universal application as its
advocates pronounced. Civiale's data set provided the
data the l'Acade
´ mie des Sciences needed to vindicate
his lithotrite and lithotrity as a less morbid treatment
for bladder stones.
Urologist discussions of survival
In 1862, the British Medical Journal published a report
from a hospital gazette showing that Civiale's data
from 1860 to 1861 focused on both survival/mortality
and quality of life. In terms of survival, the following
was noted about Civiale's cases:
Taking all his cases in 1860 and 1981 together,
M. Civiale has had 120 calculous patients: 115 males
and 5 females. Of these, lithotrity has been performed
on 88; of whom, 3 have died, 79 have recovered; and in
6 functional disturbances remain--independent, how-
ever, both of the stone and of the operation.
Lithotomy has been performed on 17 patients; of
whom 8 are cured, 2 have fistulae remaining, and
7 have died. The remaining 15 patients have not been
operated on; 6 have died, and 9 are still alive.
However, not only were Civiale's own patients
included as data points to support his procedure,
but his lithotrity procedure had also gained widespread
support from urologists over Europe who were collect-
ing data on their patients. Civiale added these sets to
his own data in his report to the Academie des
sciences. Belinaye (1837) notes that with lithotomy,
1024 of 5443 patients died, and with lithotrity, 5 of 245
patients died.
Glasgow urologist's commentary on
Civiale's data set and Buchanan's
data set in Glasgow
George Buchanan (1868), a surgeon and lecturer on
Clinical Surgery at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, gives an
insight into how data from one country become incor-
porated into surgical practice in the 1800s. Buchanan
notes that the lithotrity procedure was not used exten-
sively in Glasgow for the following reasons: cost of the
instrument; and once a lithotrite had been donated, the
surgeon's lack of experience and a lack of understand-
ing of which patients would most benefit from lithotrity
over lithotomy. Buchanan then notes that once an
expert surgeon demonstrated the use of the lithotrite
and the procedure, its use increased. For Buchanan,
the additional reason why data are not accumulated
in large data sets is that no qualified person was willing
to take the time to put the data together in a data set
for analysis and interpretation.
In his 1868 paper, Buchanan also described the
problems in patient selection for lithotrity in terms of
characteristics of stone (size, difficulty in crushing, and
the shape of the resultant fragments to be removed
from the bladder through the urethra with the litho-
trite); the characteristics of the patient and his anatomy
(degree of debility, presence of stricture, presence of an
enlarged prostate, atony of the bladder, and chronic
cystitis); and the general health and age of the patient.
Given the importance of patient characteristics in deter-
mining patient risk, Buchanan further notes the follow-
ing about the relative mortality of the two surgical
procedures (surgery versus lithotrity): ``It is almost
impossible to come to anything like an accurate result
[of the chance of the patient's survival] by taking num-
bers only; still, by taking a very extensive survey, an
approximation to truth may be made.'' In a pamphlet
published in 1880, Buchanan notes that mortality with
the performance of lithotrity in his hands was ``1 death
in 7½ cases for all ages, and 1 in 16½ in children under
15 years.'' But Buchanan did not list the total number
of procedures he had personally performed in patients
with bladder stones.
Civiale's procedure and his supporting
numerical data as reviewed by the
Acade
´mie des sciences
In terms of Civiale's patient numbers, 5443 patients
underwent surgery for removal of the bladder
stone(s), and 245 patients underwent Civiale's lithotrity
procedure. The Acade
´ mie des sciences commissioned
Poisson et al. (1835) to evaluate Civiale's data.
Commentators (Black, 2001; Matthews, 2001;
Tro
¨ hler, 2001; Vandenbroucke, 2001) note that this
type of presentation of data by a surgeon to an
august body of experts--Poisson, an expert statistician;
Dulong, a physician-chemist; Larrey, a great military
surgeon who was Napoleon's surgeon; and Double, a
representative of the medical establishment--was a
unique form of peer review for Civiale's era. These
evaluators noted that these numbers were ``all supplied
by the practice of the greatest surgeons alive.''
Physicians in Civiale's era considered the set of 5443þ
patient cases a large number. Even though the reported
numbers were large, derived from experts across
Europe, and considered even today as ``hard data''
(survival and mortality data (Boivin, 2014)), the
Acade
´ mie des sciences subjected Civiale's data to rigor-
ous review.
Poisson et al. (1835) noted that these comparative
calculations were not made on very accurate bases
(retrospective review of reported cases); therefore,
Mazur 3
they could not take the place of science. In addition, the
expert reports lacked details of how the expert urolo-
gists carried out the assessments. Thus, for the
Acade
´ mie des sciences, these reports fell short of the
goal of determining the numerical proportions of mor-
tality after incision with any degree of accuracy. Yet,
the commission commended Civiale for recognizing
both the importance of large numbers and many of
the problems interpreting large numbers, especially
when those large numbers involved a compilation of
data sets from different urologic surgeons. The
Acade
´ mie des sciences concluded that Civiale's work
comparing surgical approaches (surgery versus lithot-
rity) was moving in the right direction. In the commis-
sion's report on Civiale's data, Civiale was encouraged
``to pursue his statistical research to increase the
volume of data, and to provide more circumstantial
detail to make it more conclusive. . .''
Different views on importance of
Civiale's data: Surgeon versus historian
versus statistician
As noted by Buchanan, surgeons of Civiale's day were
already interested in both mortality data and other
data, such as the demographics of the patient that
made a procedure like lithotrity more or less suitable
to be undertaken. From a historian's perspective,
Tro
¨ hler (2001) argues that Civiale's report on his litho-
trite and lithotrity procedure presented to the
Acade
´ mie des sciences in 1835 was part of a formal
evaluation of Civiale's numbers. This evaluation by
urologic surgeons and Poisson, as a participant evalu-
ator, needs to be viewed in ``the context of a contest in
contemporary French medical literature about the
applicability of `statistics' to `medicine''' (Tro
¨ hler,
2001). However, Civiale's numbers on the relative mor-
tality of his lithotrity procedure versus lithotomy (cyst-
otomy) were so good from a mortality reduction
standpoint that expert urologists throughout Europe
adopted the lithotrity procedure in their own practice
and continued with the procedure based on their own
clinical experience with both lithotomy and lithotrity.
Civiale's data set on bladder stone removal was the
most extensive of its day, and his less invasive proced-
ure of lithotrity and his instrument (which other urolo-
gists in France and around Europe used quickly and
improved upon readily) continued to develop over time.
Even Civiale started using Heurteloup's instruments in
his lithotrity practice.
Summary and conclusions
Civiale had the large numbers necessary for statistical
analysis, yet the success of his lithotrity procedure was
its reduced invasiveness over lithotomy as recognizable
without the need for a statistic. Buchanan, a professor
of surgery, was interested in clarifying how deaths
could be misattributed in such large data sets.
Urologic surgeons showed strong understanding of
how numbers could be used in comparing surgical pro-
cedures on key parameters like age and death,
well ahead of physicians comparing treatments in the
medical domain.
The impetus for consideration of large numbers in
health and medical decision-making in the 1800s rested
on surgeons' collections of survival and mortality data
on the new instruments they developed and the new
procedures they invented. Internal medicine physicians
and psychiatrists lagged behind in this era of large num-
bers but caught up, as France's adoption of hospital-
based care allowed not only postmortem examination
but also the in-hospital recording of patients' histories,
symptoms, signs, and physical examination findings
before they died and went to postmortem examination.
Robert Koch did not discover the tuberculosis bacil-
lus until the end of the 1800s, and it was a while before
physicians recognized this bacillus as one cause of many
cases of phthisis that had ravaged Europe and the rest
of the world through preceding generations. In health
and medicine, for physicians other than surgeons, the
importance of large numbers only started to be appre-
ciated in the 1800s, even though mathematicians saw
their need in society much earlier. But even the statis-
ticians of the day, like Poisson, saw the application of
statistics, not so much in health and medicine, but more
so in prediction in the courts and the law. Thus, the
appreciation of large numbers in internal medicine and
psychiatry would be further delayed. Physicians need
large numbers as a key component of Big Data for
two purposes: to understand the full range of the
ways a disease may present in a human and to compare
one treatment of a disease against another treatment in
patients.
Today, the term ``lithotripsy'' (synonymous with
lithotrity in Civiale's day) dominates the urologic
research literature and urologists are crushing concre-
ments in the urinary tract through lithotripsy (rather
than surgery). Instead of a lithotrite, urologists study-
ing various crushing procedures for stones in the urin-
ary system are comparing instruments like the holmium
laser versus the ultrasound probe. For example,
Jako
´ bczyk et al. (2011) reported data on 164 patients
who underwent endoscopic lithotripsy. Of these, 98
were treated with a holmium laser and 66 with an ultra-
sound probe. Before surgery, all patients underwent
urological ultrasound and radiological imaging to
localize the stone, and the effectiveness was measured
using radiological and renal ultrasound imaging. An
effective state was reached if the stone was invisible
4 Big Data & Society
by radiograph and ultrasound imaging after the
procedure.
Laser lithotripsy was 100% effective in the bladder
(25 of 25 patients), and 89% effective in stones localized
in the ureters. Using an ultrasound probe, the proced-
ure was 79% effective (52 out of 66 procedures). With
laser lithotripsy, two of the patients were found to have
inflammatory changes of the ureter which necessitated
undergoing open surgery. A third patient sustained a
perforation of the ureter with laser lithotripsy. The
authors concluded the following: ``The results prove
that laser lithotripsy is a method of high effectiveness
with a low risk of complication. It might surpass sono-
trode and become its alternative. Both methods have
both advantages and disadvantages.''
Today, regional studies are being conducted to iden-
tify and explain inconsistencies to formulate best prac-
tice patterns for use in clinical urology across regions of
a country or across countries. Brown et al. (2014) con-
ducted one such study in the United States to evaluate
such regional differences in shockwave lithotripsy. The
researchers examined a prospectively maintained data-
base retrospectively and evaluated regional differences
across four distinct American geographic regions invol-
ving 2240 procedures. The authors found regional dif-
ferences in all parameters. In their conclusions, the
researchers state: ``Inconsistencies in regional adapta-
tion of best practices may identify opportunities for
further education.''
The most notable differences in the reporting of pro-
cedures of the urologic sciences today compared with
the urologic sciences of the 1800s are the safety of
patients and study participants and the care with
which data is analyzed statistically. Two factors medi-
ate the need for large numbers in research studies in
urology today: the primary factor is the need to protect
study participants by not exposing them to unnecessary
risks (Mazur, 2007), and the second factor is the need to
study a large enough group of patients to yield statis-
tically significant results.
