Abstract
Background: Chronic diseases contribute a large share of disease burden in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). Chronic diseases have a tendency to occur simultaneously and where there are two or more such
conditions, this is termed as `multimorbidity'. Multimorbidity is associated with adverse health outcomes, but
limited research has been undertaken in LMICs. Therefore, this study examines the prevalence and correlates of
multimorbidity as well as the associations between multimorbidity and self-rated health, activities of daily living
(ADLs), quality of life, and depression across six LMICs.
Methods: Data was obtained from the WHO's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave-1 (2007/10). This
was a cross-sectional population based survey performed in LMICs, namely China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and
South Africa, including 42,236 adults aged 18 years and older. Multimorbidity was measured as the simultaneous
presence of two or more of eight chronic conditions including angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, chronic lung disease,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and vision impairment. Associations with four health outcomes were examined,
namely ADL limitation, self-rated health, depression, and a quality of life index. Random-intercept multilevel regression
models were used on pooled data from the six countries.
Results: The prevalence of morbidity and multimorbidity was 54.2 % and 21.9 %, respectively, in the pooled sample of
six countries. Russia had the highest prevalence of multimorbidity (34.7 %) whereas China had the lowest (20.3 %). The
likelihood of multimorbidity was higher in older age groups and was lower in those with higher socioeconomic status.
In the pooled sample, the prevalence of 1+ ADL limitation was 14 %, depression 5.7 %, self-rated poor health 11.6 %,
and mean quality of life score was 54.4. Substantial cross-country variations were seen in the four health outcome
measures. The prevalence of 1+ ADL limitation, poor self-rated health, and depression increased whereas quality of life
declined markedly with an increase in number of diseases.
Conclusions: Findings highlight the challenge of multimorbidity in LMICs, particularly among the lower
socioeconomic groups, and the pressing need for reorientation of health care resources considering the distribution of
multimorbidity and its adverse effect on health outcomes.

Background
Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the 21st
century are witnessing an unprecedented upward shift
in life expectancy [1]. This is causing changes in the
disease burden profiles of LMICs, with chronic non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) becoming more com-
mon and growing public health challenge [2­5]. As a
result of increasing longevity, multiple comorbid condi-
tions, commonly referred to as `multimorbidity', have
also become progressively more common among older
adults [6­8]. Evidence from both high- and low-income
countries indicates that older adults are at much higher
risk for multiple chronic diseases [9­14]. At the same
time, several recent studies have provided evidence that
younger adults also have substantial prevalence of
multimorbidity [15­19].
Socioeconomic status (SES) has been found to be
strongly associated with the prevalence of multimorbidity,
regardless of whether SES is measured through education
[20, 21], income [22], occupation [23], or area-based
deprivation [24]. In a review of 26 studies on multimor-
bidity focused on East-Mediterranean countries, Boutayab
et al. [25] show that low income, low level of education,
and unemployment are associated with higher prevalence
of multimorbidity.
Multimorbidity has been associated with adverse health
outcomes, such as reduced physical function [26, 27], poor
quality of life [28], poor self-rated health (SRH) [29, 30],
increased use of inpatient and ambulatory care [13, 31],
and mortality [10]. More than two decades ago, Verbrugge
et al. [32] demonstrated the exponential increase in dis-
ability with increasing numbers of chronic diseases. Multi-
morbidity also raises the complexities of clinical treatment
and patient management, and is consequently associated
with higher medical care costs owing to the need for long-
term care [17, 33]. The adverse impact of multimorbidity
on other health domains is further exacerbated by socio-
economic deprivation and poorly prepared medical care
facilities [34­36].
Studies investigating the prevalence and determinants
of multimorbidity have primarily focused on high-
income countries (HICs). Multimorbidity studies in
LMICs are limited in geographical scope, the number of
diseases studied and the effects of multimorbidity (abso-
lute number of diseases or disease combinations) on
health outcomes such as physical functioning, quality of
life, or mental health [12, 22, 25, 37, 38]. Of the few
existing studies on multimorbidity prevalence from
LMICs, Khanam et al. [12] estimated the prevalence of
multimorbidity to be 53.8 % among the older adult
population of Bangladesh. Alaba and Chola [22] ana-
lyzed the adult (aged 18+) population of South Africa
and reported 4 % to have multimorbidity, with over 70
% of these adults being women. The large and growing
burden of NCDs in LMICs, particularly when coupled
with limitations in resources and competing public
health priorities points, to the need to understand the
burden of multimorbidity [39, 40].
In the present study, data from the World Health
Organization's multi-country Study on global AGEing
and adult health (WHO SAGE) Wave 1 was used to in-
vestigate two main objectives: 1) to explore the preva-
lence and SES correlates of multimorbidity in adults,
and 2) to examine the associations between multimor-
bidity and four main health outcomes: self-rated overall
general health, depression, physical functioning, and
subjective well-being.
Hypotheses
This study aims to test the following hypotheses:
1) LMICs will exhibit a negative association between
higher SES and multimorbidity, similar to the evidence
from HICs and some developing countries, and 2) mul-
timorbidity will have positive associations with other
health-related outcomes, namely lower SRH, depres-
sion, limitation in activities of daily living (ADLs), and
poorer quality of life.
Data sources
This study used data from SAGE Wave 1 (2007­2010).
SAGE is a longitudinal ageing and health study with
nationally representative samples of adults from six
countries: China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian
Federation, and South Africa. These countries are at dif-
ferent stages of the demographic and epidemiological
transitions but are (with the exception of Russia) experien-
cing a rapid rise in the older adult population [41]. SAGE
is designed as a multi-wave panel study representative of
the population aged 50 and older, with a smaller cohort of
respondents aged 18­49 for comparative purposes. All
sampling plans use multistage clustered design samples
drawn from an updated frame. Each household and indi-
vidual is assigned a known non-zero probability of being
selected [42]. Household and individual weights were
post-stratified to weight up to population distributions by
age and sex in each country. Detailed description of study
and sample design is provided elsewhere [42, 43].
Methods
Chronic conditions and multimorbidity
Multimorbidity is defined as the simultaneous presence of
two or more chronic physical health conditions. For this
analysis, eight chronic health conditions were included,
namely angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, chronic lung
disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and low
visual acuity.
Of these eight conditions, diabetes mellitus and stroke
were assessed through a question about ever being
Arokiasamy et al. BMC Medicine (2015) 13:178 Page 2 of 16
diagnosed with the disease by a health professional. The
specific question was, "Have you ever been told by a
health professional/doctor that you have (disease name)?"
The prevalence of angina pectoris, arthritis, asthma, and
chronic lung disease was derived from a set of symptom-
based questions, combined with a diagnostic algorithm.
The symptomatic questions and algorithm for each of the
diseases are presented in the supplementary material
(Additional file 1). Additionally, the use of treatment/
medication received in the 12 months prior to interview
was indicative of a diagnosis and was included in preva-
lence estimates for each disease. Prevalence of angina,
arthritis, and asthma was based on symptom-reporting
and diagnostic algorithm, adjusted for treatment/medica-
tion received in the 12 months prior to interview.
The assessment of hypertension and visual acuity was
based on direct physical examination undertaken at the
time of interview. The prevalence of hypertension was
based on measured blood pressure (systolic and dia-
stolic) taken with the respondent in a seated position.
An average of the second and third of three total read-
ings was used as the outcome. In accordance with
WHO/ISH guidelines for the management of hyperten-
sion [44], the limit for high systolic blood pressure was
140 mm/hg or above, and for diastolic blood pressure 90
mm/hg or above. An individual was considered to be
hypertensive if average systolic or diastolic blood pres-
sure readings exceeded either of these thresholds or they
reported current treatment for hypertension.
Visual acuity was measured for both near and distance
vision in each eye using a tumbling "E" logMAR chart
[45]. Measured near and distance visual acuity was classi-
fied into normal vision (0.32­1.6 decimal) and low vision
(0.01­0.25 decimal) [46]. In this study, a respondent had
low vision if they had either low near or distance vision in
both eyes.
Health outcomes
Self-rated health (SRH)
The specific question used to assess overall general SRH
was, "In general, how would you rate your health today?"
A five-point response scale was used: very good, good,
moderate, bad, and very bad. For this analysis, bad and
very bad health responses were combined as `poor
health' and remaining categories combined into `good
health' to generate a dichotomous health variable. Poor
SRH is the outcome used in the analysis.
Physical functioning: activities of daily living (ADL)
Limitation in ADL was used to assess physical function-
ing. The questions were based on self- reported difficulty
in engaging in activities during the last 30 days, using a
five-point response scale ranging from none to extreme
difficulty. The ADL measure included in SAGE was
based on WHODAS 2.0 and has been validated in LMICs
by WHO and collaborating agencies [47]. WHODAS 2.0
is validated cross-culturally through a systematic research
study. The cross-cultural applicability research study used
various qualitative methods to explore the nature and
practice of health status assessment in different cultures.
The study included linguistic analysis of health-related ter-
minology, key informant interviews, focus groups, and
quasi-quantitative methods such as pile sorting and con-
cept mapping (carried out in tandem). Information was
gathered on the conceptualization of disability and on im-
portant areas of day-to-day functioning.
In this study, severe and extreme difficulties were
combined to represent limitation in a particular activity.
We have used an extended set of ADL that included sit-
ting for long periods, walking 100 m, standing up, stand-
ing for long periods, climbing one flight of stairs,
stooping/kneeling/crouching, picking up things with fin-
gers, extending arms above shoulders, concentrating for
10 min, walking a long distance (1 km), bathing, getting
dressed, carrying things, moving around inside home,
getting up from lying down, and getting to and using the
toilet. For the analysis, a dichotomous variable was cre-
ated, which took value 1 if the respondent noted a limi-
tation in one or more of the above ADLs (1+ ADL) and
0 otherwise.
Quality of life
The 8-item WHO Quality of Life (WHOQoL) instru-
ment was used to quantify quality of life and included
two questions in each of four broad domains: physical,
psychological, social, and environmental [48]. Quality of
life was assessed by asking respondents to rate their sat-
isfaction with different domains of their lives, such as
with money, health, and relationships, as well as rating
their overall life satisfaction, using a five-point response
scale, ranging from very satisfied to very dissatisfied. A
composite score was created by summing the responses
across the different questions and rescaling the result
from 0­100 where a higher score indicated better quality
of life.
Mental health
Depression was used as a measure of mental health. De-
pression was assessed through a set of symptomatic
questions based on the World Mental Health Survey
version of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view [49]. Diagnosis of major depressive episode was de-
rived from an algorithm that accounted for reporting
symptoms of depression during the past 12 months [50].
The detailed symptomatic questions and algorithm are
provided in the supplementary material (Additional file 1).
Prevalence was based on the result of the diagnostic algo-
rithm, adjusting for treatment received.

Indicators of socioeconomic status and control variables
Years of schooling and household wealth quintile were
used to represent SES. For analytical convenience, the
highest number of years of education completed was
grouped into four categories: no formal schooling, 1­5
years, 6­9 years, and 10 or more years of schooling. In
addition to education, household wealth was used as an
alternate measure of SES. A wealth index was derived
from the household ownership of durable goods, dwell-
ing characteristics (type of floors, walls and cooking
stove), and access to services such as improved water,
sanitation, and cooking fuel. The detailed list of items is
given in the supplementary material (Additional file 1).
The results were recoded into dichotomous variables
taking the value of 0 if the household did not possess or
have access to the good or service, and 1 if it did. A pure
random effect model was used to estimate assets per
household, then an `asset ladder' was generated for each
country [51]. Using a Bayesian post-estimation (empir-
ical Bayes) method, households were arranged on the
asset ladder, where the raw continuous income estimates
were transformed in the final step into quintiles.
Two sets of control variables, demographic factors and
health risk factors, were included in this study. The
demographic variables included: age groups (18­49, 50­
59, 60­69, 70+), locality (urban or rural), sex (men or
women), and marital status (currently married/cohabiting
or all other). The health risk variables consisted of tobacco
use [current users (daily or non-daily) or non-user]; alco-
hol consumption [current user (consumed 1­4 days/week
in the last 12 months) or non-user]; physical activity (ac-
tive [involved in 150+ minutes of vigorous activity or 300+
minutes of moderate activity per week] or otherwise in-
active); high risk waist-to-hip ratio (cutoff point: 0.90 for
men and 0.85 for women); and obesity classification
(BMI 30).
Statistical methods
A two-stage statistical analysis was undertaken; first, the
correlates of any morbidity and multimorbidity (2+
chronic diseases) were examined using a multinomial
logit model. Second, the association between multimor-
bidity and the four primary health outcomes were exam-
ined: 1+ ADL, presence of depression, poor SRH, and
low WHOQoL score. Of the four health outcomes, three
were binary variables, 1+ ADL limitation, depression,
and poor SRH; therefore, logit models were used to
examine the association of morbidity with these indica-
tors. Linear regression was used to investigate associa-
tions with the WHOQoL index. All regressions were run
on the pooled data from the six countries and therefore
estimated in a multilevel framework. Random intercept
multilevel (three-level) models were used, where country
was the highest level, state/province of residence the
second level, and individuals the first level. All analyses
were carried out in STATA 12.0. The estimates were
considered significant if P <0.10.
Ethical approval
SAGE was approved by the World Health Organization's
Ethical Review Committee. Additionally, partner organi-
zations in each country implementing SAGE obtained
ethical clearance through their respective institutional
review bodies.
Informed consent
Written informed consent was obtained from all study
participants.
Results
Sample characteristics
This study analyzed data from 42,236 adults (18,243
men and 23,993 women) aged 18 years from WHO
SAGE Wave 1 in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia,
and South Africa. Table 1 presents the percentage distri-
bution of socioeconomic and demographic characteris-
tics of the study population from each country. Among
the countries, the Russian Federation had the highest
percentage of population aged 70 years and above (12.5
%) compared to less than 10 % for the other countries.
The proportion living in rural areas ranged from 19 % in
Russia to 75 % in India. The percentage of population with
no formal schooling was highest in India (36.2 %) followed
by Ghana (32.7 %) and lowest for Russia (0.3 %). The per-
centage of population with 10+ years of schooling was
highest in Russia (87 %) compared to less than 30 % for
Ghana (29.4 %), India (26.8 %), and Mexico (25.7 %).
Prevalence of multimorbidity and the primary health
outcome measures
Table 2 shows the prevalence of having any single chronic
disease, multimorbidity (2+ chronic diseases), 1+ ADL
limitation, depression, poor SRH, and low mean WHO-
QoL index based on the pooled sample of the six SAGE
countries. Overall, the prevalence of morbidity ­ de-
fined as the presence of at least one of the eight chronic
diseases ­ was 54.2 %. The prevalence of having at least
one chronic disease was highest in South Africa (69.4 %)
followed by Ghana (62.1 %), and lowest in India (51.6 %).
The overall prevalence of multimorbidity was 21.9 %.
Among the six countries, Russia had the highest preva-
lence of multimorbidity (34.7 %) and the lowest was ob-
served in China (20.3 %); the remaining four countries had
a multimorbidity prevalence of approximately 22 %.
The prevalence of any single condition and of multi-
morbidity increased with each progressively older age
group; 87 % of the population in the oldest age group
(70+) had at least one chronic disease and 60.7 % had
Arokiasamy et al. BMC Medicine (2015) 13:178 Page 4 of 16
multimorbidity. Similarly, the prevalence of single mor-
bidity and multimorbidity was consistently higher in
those with lower levels of education and wealth, and
lower in those with higher education and wealth
(Table 2). For example, prevalence of multimorbidity
was 35.2 % and any one morbidity was 66.0 % among
adults with no formal schooling compared to 16.0 % and
45.3 % prevalence among adults with 10+ years of
schooling.
Overall, 14 % of respondents had 1+ ADL limitation,
5.7 % had depression, 11.6 % reported poor SRH, and
the mean WHOQoL score was 54.4 (on the scale of 0 to
100). Poorer health outcomes were generally more
prevalent at older ages, in women, in rural dwellers, at
lower SES, and with larger numbers of comorbid condi-
tions. While considerable cross-country variations were
observed in the prevalence of 1+ ADL, depression, poor
SRH, and low mean WHOQoL scores, the overall pat-
terns were consistent.
Table 2 also shows the prevalence of the four health out-
comes among adults with different numbers of chronic
conditions. With increasing numbers of chronic condi-
tions, each of the four health outcome measures became
worse. For instance, the percentage of adults with 1+ ADL
increased eight-fold (from 7.1 % to 58.7 %), depression
prevalence increased by nine-fold (3.2 % to 27 %), poor
SRH increased six-fold (from 5.8 % to 50 %), and the mean
WHOQoL score declined from 57.0 to 43.3 in those with
no chronic diseases compared to those with four or more
conditions, respectively.
Associations between SES and multimorbidity
Both measures of SES were negatively associated with
1+ ADL, depression, and poor SRH, while positively

associated with WHOQoL score (Table 2). For ex-
ample, 33.6 % of respondents with no formal education
had 1+ ADL compared to 6.3 % in those with 10+ years
of schooling. The prevalence of depression was 12 % in
the no formal schooling group versus 3.7 % in 10+
years schooling group, while poor SRH was 18.6 % in
the no formal schooling group versus 5.2 % in the 10+

was worse (51.0) for respondents with no formal
schooling compared to 57.5 for those with 10+ years of
schooling. A similar pattern was observed for house-
hold wealth quintiles.

Figure 1 presents the prevalence of multimorbidity by
years of schooling completed and household wealth
quintiles, and by country. Years of schooling completed
showed a pronounced negative association with the
prevalence of multimorbidity for all countries, with the
largest differences observed in Mexico and Russia. Small
differences were seen in the prevalence of multimorbid-
ity across wealth quintiles in all countries except Russia.
Correlates of chronic disease and multimorbidity
Table 3 presents the estimates of multilevel multinomial
logistic regression models used to examine the associ-
ation of socioeconomic, demographic, and health risk
factors with multimorbidity. The dependent variable had
three categories: no disease, one disease, and 2+ diseases
(multimorbidity). The `no disease' category was consid-
ered as the reference group in the multinomial logit re-
gression model. Table 3 shows that the relative risks of
both one disease and multimorbidity (2+ diseases) in-
creased at each higher age group compared to no disease.
For example, compared to the 18­49 age group, adults in
the 70+ age group were four times (RRR = 4.04) more
likely to have one disease, and almost 18 times (RRR =
17.9) more likely to have multimorbidity relative to no
disease. Compared with men, women were significantly
more likely (RRR = 1.26) to have multimorbidity than no
disease. Adults living in rural areas were less likely than
urban dwellers (RRR = 0.95) to have multimorbidity rela-
tive to no disease. Measures of SES, based on years of
schooling and wealth quintiles, were negatively associated
with both multimorbidity and having one disease. Further-
more, all health risk factors, except tobacco consumption,
were significantly associated with higher prevalence of
both one disease and multimorbidity.
ADL limitations, poor self-rated health (SRH), depression,
and quality of life by number of diseases
Figure 2 shows the patterns of the four health outcomes,
by number of chronic conditions and country. Across all
figures, there is a consistent pattern of poor health out-
comes with an increasing number of chronic conditions.
There is, however, variation by country and domains.
The ADL limitations increased sharply and consistently
across all six countries with increasing number of dis-
eases; the largest increase was observed in India and the
lowest in South Africa. Compared to adults with one or
two chronic diseases, the level of depression was sub-
stantially higher among adults with three or more
chronic diseases. WHOQoL declined steadily (quality of
life worsened) and prevalence of poor SRH increased
with the number of conditions for all six countries.
Association of multimorbidity with the four health
outcome measures
The effects of multimorbidity on ADL, depression, SRH,
and WHOQoL are presented in Table 4. The table
shows both adjusted (for control variables) and un-
adjusted estimates for each of the health outcomes. The
count of chronic diseases has a statistically significant
negative effect on all four health outcomes. Each health
outcome showed poorer results as the number of
chronic diseases increased. For ADL limitations, depres-
sion and poor SRH, the adjusted and unadjusted odds
were similar. Those with three chronic diseases were
more than four times as likely to have 1+ ADL, depres-
sion, and poor SRH as adults with no diseases. Com-
pared with adults with no disease, those with four or
more diseases were almost seven times more likely to
have 1+ ADL (OR = 7.21), depression (OR = 7.33), and
poor SRH (OR = 7.38). The WHOQoL index was an
average of eight points lower (adjusted  = -8.93) for
adults with three chronic diseases compared to adults
with no diseases.
Table 5 presents the regression analyses for the associ-
ation of individual diseases and disease pairs on each of
the subjective health outcomes. In Table 5, the results of
Model 1 show the effects of individual chronic diseases
on subjective health outcomes, after adjusting for the ef-
fects of other diseases and the control variables. Model 2
presents the main effects as well as the interactions of
the chronic disease pairs. Results from Model 1 show
that all diseases, except hypertension, had statistically

significant negative effects on the subjective health out-
comes. For example, adults with arthritis were more
than two times as likely to have 1+ ADL and depression,
and 1.8 times more likely to report poor SRH. The effect
on WHOQoL was also negative; the mean score was
three points lower among adults with arthritis. The
other chronic diseases, including angina, lung diseases,
low vision, diabetes, and stroke showed similar negative
effects on subjective health outcomes.
Results of Model 2 reveal that the main effects on the
different subjective health outcomes for all the condi-
tions except hypertension were significant and negative.
Subjective health measures were worse for adults with
chronic diseases. The `main effects' indicate the effect of
each disease on a person suffering from none of the
other conditions. The interaction estimates for the pairs
of diseases showed a mixed pattern. While only a few of
the interactions were significant, some of the disease
pair interaction terms were positive, and some were
negative. A positive interaction (odds ratio greater than
one in logit models of 1+ ADL, depression, and poor
SRH and negative coefficients in linear regressions for
WHOQoL) shows that the combined effect of two dis-
eases was more than the additive effect of each one of
them individually; while a negative interaction (odds ra-
tio less than one in logit models of 1+ ADL, depression,
and poor SRH and positive coefficients in linear regres-
sions for WHOQoL) indicates that the effect of the two
diseases was less than the additive effect of each of them
individually. The positive interactions show synergistic
effects of the pair of diseases and the negative interac-
tions show antagonistic effects.
Regression results for 1+ ADL showed that the inter-
actions of nine disease pairs were statistically significant:
hypertension-angina, hypertension-diabetes, arthritis-
angina, arthritis-lung diseases, arthritis-asthma, arthritis-

low vision, angina-chronic lung diseases, angina-
asthma, and low vision-diabetes. Of these nine, the
hypertension-diabetes was synergistic. For depression,
the interactions of six disease pairs were statistically sig-
nificant: hypertension-angina, arthritis-angina, arthritis-
chronic lung diseases, angina-diabetes, chronic lung
diseases-asthma, and low vision-diabetes; but no syner-
gistic interactions emerged. For poor SRH, interactions
with nine disease pairs were statistically significant:
hypertension-asthma, arthritis-angina, arthritis-lung dis-
eases, arthritis-asthma, angina-chronic lung disease,
angina-low vision, chronic lung diseases-diabetes, asthma-
diabetes, and low vision-diabetes. Of these significant
interactions, only the hypertension-asthma pairing was
synergistically associated with poor SRH. Similarly, for
WHOQoL, interactions with seven disease pairs were sig-
nificant: hypertension-asthma, arthritis-angina, arthritis-
chronic lung disease, arthritis-asthma, arthritis-diabetes,
angina-chronic lung diseases, and low vision-diabetes. The
pairing of hypertension-asthma showed synergistic inter-
actions with the WHOQoL results.
Discussion
In this study, the prevalence and correlates of multimor-
bidity (encompassing eight chronic diseases ­ angina
pectoris, arthritis, asthma, chronic lung disease, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and low visual acuity)
among adults in six LMICs was assessed. The impact of
multimorbidity on four health outcome measures (ADL,
depression, SRH, and quality of life) was examined.
The results show that more than half of the sample
had at least one chronic disease and around one-fifth
had multimorbidity. Among the six countries, Russia
had the highest prevalence of multimorbidity (35 %) and
China had the lowest (20 %). Ghana, India, Mexico, and
South Africa had similar levels of multimorbidity, at
around 22%. Further, it may be noted here that the high
prevalence of measured hypertension in all six SAGE
countries (ranging between 24 % in India to 51 % in
South Africa) contributes substantially to the overall
prevalence of multimorbidity. A comparative assessment
of the multimorbidity with inclusion and exclusion of
hypertension demonstrates that, with the exclusion of
hypertension, the prevalence of multimorbidity is re-
markably lower (21 % in Russia and 9 % in China) than
that with the inclusion of hypertension in multimorbid-
ity measure (Table 1 in Additional file 1).
The prevalence of multimorbidity was lower at higher
levels of education in all six countries, demonstrating
overall correlation of low SES with multimorbidity.
Household wealth was negatively associated with multi-
morbidity for China and Russia, whereas the other four
countries did not show a consistent pattern. The results
of negative SES gradient of multimorbidity are consist-
ent with the findings of previous studies [18, 21, 26, 36].
The SES gradient for multimorbidity was the sharpest
for Russia, while the SES gradient was smallest for
Ghana and India. The insignificant or inconsistent pat-
tern of multimorbidity prevalence by household wealth
in the lower income countries could be attributed to ap-
parently contrasting socioeconomic patterns of NCD

risk factors. Such patterns may arise on account of bet-
ter access to health care and awareness about prevention
and control of NCD risk factors among the wealthier
stratum in high- and middle-income countries on one
hand, while on the other hand, the wealthier stratum in
lower income countries look to have higher levels of
health risks like high BMI, high waist-hip ratio, choles-
terol, and reduced physical activity [52­55]. Hosseinpoor
et al. [56] have shown that the magnitude and direction
of socioeconomic inequalities showed different patterns
across risk factors such as sex and country income
group. The adoption of risky health behaviors tends to
transition from higher to lower socioeconomic groups as
countries grow richer [57]. Analysis of cross-sectional
correlates of multimorbidity suggests that multimorbid-
ity is higher among older adults, women, and those with
lower educational levels. These results are consistent
with findings from several other studies [18, 36, 58, 59].
These six LMICs studied are home to a large propor-
tion (42 %) of the world's older population: a population
at risk of the NCDs included in this study [60­63].
China faces a steep increase in chronic NCDs [64, 65].
India has to deal with an ongoing high burden from in-
fectious and parasitic diseases as well as a rapidly rising
burden from chronic diseases [66]. Mexico has seen a 52
% rise (from 23 % to 75 %) in the proportion of deaths
from NCDs over the last 50 years [67], with NCDs now
the leading cause of death and disease, representing 43
% of deaths and 51 % of disability-adjusted life years
[68]. While Ghana has recognized the growing burden
of chronic disease since the early 1990s, it is yet to im-
plement a chronic disease policy or an integrated plan to

deal with the issue [69]. In Russia, in the face of high
adult mortality, expectancy began to decline in the mid-
1960s and continued until the 2000s; such changes were
mainly due to mortality from preventable causes, includ-
ing chronic diseases and related risk factors and a lack
of comprehensive disease prevention programs for
NCDs [70­73]. South Africa is in the midst of a health
transition characterized by a quadruple burden of com-
municable, non-communicable, and perinatal and mater-
nal diseases, and interpersonal violence [74, 75]. The
growing burden of NCDs requires concerted action from
each of the governments in these countries.
Overall, the data reported herein indicate that multimor-
bidity has a significant impact on older adult physical and
mental health outcomes in LMICs. The results confirm
the negative effect of multimorbidity on quality of life,
physical functioning, and mental health in LMICs, as has
been previously demonstrated in HICs [26, 76­79]. Stud-
ies from HICs have further documented the synergistic ef-
fects of multimorbidity and socioeconomic deprivation
[17, 78]; however, in contrast, no significant synergistic ef-
fects of number of diseases and socioeconomic
deprivation were observed from this analysis (results are
not presented).
The published literature suggests interactions between
diseases should be considered to estimate contributions
to health outcomes [80]; therefore, regression models
were used in this study to estimate the effects of individ-
ual chronic diseases and disease pairs (interactions) on
the four health outcome measures. The estimates re-
vealed a significant and negative independent effect of
each of the chronic diseases on ADL limitation, depres-
sion, poor SRH, and quality of life. The assessment of
interaction effects of chronic disease pairs can help in-
form strategies for the prevention, control, and treat-
ment of chronic diseases. Among disease pairs, the
interaction of hypertension with most other NCDs was
more than their additive effect on ADL limitation, SRH,
and quality of life. No significant synergistic interaction
was found for depression. These results contribute data
from LMICs to the emerging evidence base on the na-
ture of disease interactions in multimorbidity [26, 29, 76,
81]. Results also showed significant antagonistic interac-
tions for all measures of health; interaction effects of
two chronic diseases is equal to or lower than the com-
bined effects of each of the individual diseases, rather
than simple additive effects. These data possibly lend
support to evidence that suggests that an individual's
level of functioning is reflected not by a simple sum of
functioning across domains, but by the impact of dis-
eases on the maximally affected domain and the number
of domains affected [82].
The finding that multimorbidity is associated with ad-
verse health outcomes has critical health care implications
for people with multimorbidity in LMICs. Persons with
multimorbidity need more inpatient and ambulatory care
[83­85]. However, patients with multimorbidity also are
at higher risk of iatrogenic disease and fragmentation of
care because the treatment in such cases is often fo-
cused on one chronic condition [86]. Most clinical evi-
dence and guidelines are created by individual disease
and rarely account for multimorbidity [87, 88]. Given
these results, the management of multimorbidity will
surely become a considerable challenge for health sys-
tems worldwide [89] and requires an integrated people-
centered service delivery approach with strengthening
of primary health care systems [90]. The challenge is
more pressing for LMICs, with health care systems
often ill-equipped and largely focused on acute illnesses
and maternal and child health care [5, 91].
Noting the potential bias introduced by disease preva-
lence derived from self-reported physician diagnosis
[92­95], this study incorporated a number of alternate
methods of estimating disease ­ using a mixture of self-
reported diagnosis, validated symptom reporting-based
diagnostic algorithms, and objective health measure-
ments. This makes the findings that multimorbidity is
also strongly associated with poor health outcomes in
LMICs all the more striking and of major importance in
public health and policy terms.
The findings from this study should be viewed in
light of important limitations. First, we have used a
count of chronic conditions as a measure of multimor-
bidity, which implies that each of the diseases has
equivalent impact on an individual. In reality, the ef-
fects of multimorbidity on various domains of health
are likely to depend on disease severity, the unique
combination of diseases, and access to treatment and
support. Second, we have modelled main effects of dis-
eases with interaction terms between disease dyads
(Table 5) to assess the effects of each disease pair on
each of the four health outcomes. Here, we did not ad-
dress the interaction of three and higher order interac-
tions due to data limitations (insufficient observations).
A third possible limitation relates to the measurement
of hypertension in this study. The classification of
hypertension based on an average of three measure-
ments at the interval of 1 minute may have contributed
to overestimation of hypertension prevalence compared
to what may arise from measurement based on regular
24 h monitoring. Finally, the number of diseases in-
cluded in this analysis was limited to those included in
the SAGE study and, as such, may be missing some
higher burden conditions, such as dementia and can-
cers, which could have resulted in an underestimation
of the prevalence and impacts of multimorbidity [96].
However, a number of studies have analyzed multimor-
bidity using a smaller number of diseases, usually less
Arokiasamy et al. BMC Medicine (2015) 13:178 Page 13 of 16
than 10, due to data limitations in LMICs [97, 98]. Re-
gardless, the prevalence found herein is striking and the
reality likely to be even more confronting if all health
conditions captured.
Conclusions
The findings provide novel epidemiological evidence of
the impact of multimorbidity on selected health out-
come measures for six LMICs which have not previously
been explored in such detail. Understandably, to date,
LMICs have focused on infectious disease, malnutrition,
and childhood health. However, these results indicate
that there is a growing need to provide effective services
for older adults to counter the impact of chronic multi-
morbidity on physical and mental health. In particular,
the high prevalence of ADL limitations indicates the
need for services for older adults. More research is re-
quired to assess the gaps in the community resources
for providing services that maintain quality of life in the
face of declining health.
