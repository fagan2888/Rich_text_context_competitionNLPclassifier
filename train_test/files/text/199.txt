Are African-American men, compared with white men, more likely
to report being stopped by police for traffic law violations? Are Afri-
can-American men and Hispanic drivers less likely to report that police
had a legitimate reason for the stop and less likely to report that police
acted properly? This study answers these questions using citizen self-
reports of their traffic stop encounters with the police. Net of other
important explanatory variables, the data indicate that police make traf-
fic stops for Driving While Black and male. In addition, African-
American and Hispanic drivers are less likely to report that police had
a legitimate reason ,for the stop and are less likely to report that police
acted properly. The study also discusses the validity of citizen self-
report data and outlines an agenda for future research.
KEYWORDS Driving While Black; traffic stops by the police.
Do police make traffic stops for Driving While Black? Are African-
American men as compared with white men more likely to self-report
being stopped by police for traffic law violations? Are African-American
and Hispanic drivers more likely to perceive the stop as pretextual and less
likely to report that police had a legitimate reason for stopping them? Do
the special problems associated with encounters between police and citi-
zens of color mean that African-American and Hispanic citizens are less
likely to exit their traffic stop encounters believing police acted properly?
This paper answers these questions using citizen self-reports of their
traffic stop encounters with police. We begin with previous research on
the effects of extralegal variables on police actions and research on Driv-
ing While Black, including the limits of that research. We then analyze
citizen self-reports from a nationally representative sample and control for
other important explanatory measures such as social class to clarify and

extend prior research on traffic stops for Driving While Black and on citi-
zen perceptions of police actions.
EXTRALEGAL VARIABLES AND POLICE ACTIONS
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Previous research has regularly reported that extralegal factors affect
police actions after an encounter with a citizen has been initiated. In the
late 1940s for instance, Goldman (1963:21-22) collected data that demon-
strated that the police officers he studied paid close attention to the race,
nationality, and social class of juvenile offenders when deciding whether to
respond formally or informally. Also in the late 1940s, Westley (1953)
found that police were quicker to use unnecessary force when suspects did
not show respect to officers and as a means of soliciting information.
Since these and similar studies (Black and Reiss, 1970),there has been a
steady stream of research focuscd on how extralegal variables affect police
actions during encounters with citizens (for reviews, see Riksheim and
Chermak, 1993: Sherman, 1980;also see Engel et al., 2000). This research
supports two conclusions. First, extralegal variables play an especially
important role in the context of low-visibility police actions such as the
decision to write a traffic ticket once a traffic stop has been made (Reiss,
1992: Ross, 1960). Second, no single extralegal variable consistently
affects police actions (Engel et al., 2000; Klinger. 1994). Accordingly,
results concerning race and ethnicity have been mixed with some finding
them important (Goldman, 1963) and others not (Black and Reiss, 1970:
Engel, et al., 2000).
However, previous research on the effects of extralegal factors has been
limited to what police do once an encounter with a citizen has begun.
Scholars. for example, have examined police resolution of traffic stop
encounters (Lundman, 1994) but not the decision by police to make a traf-
fic stop in the first place. Much less is therefore known about the possible
effects of extralegal factors such as race and ethnicity on police decisions
to proactively initiate traffic stop encounters with citizens.
DRIVING WHILE BLACK
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Research on "Driving While Black" remedies the limits of scholarly
study of the effects of extralegal factors by directing sustained attention to
whether race and ethnicity affect police decisions to initiate traffic stop
encounters (Harris, 2002). This literature also directs attention to how
race and ethnicity shape citizen perceptions of the legitimacy of the traffic
TRAFFIC STOPS AND POLICE ACTIONS 197
stop and to citizen perceptions of the propriety of police actions during the
traffic stop encounter (Weitzer and Tuch, 2002).
Extant studies of traffic stops for Driving While Black appear to indi-
cate that police stop African-American drivers more often than would be
expected on the basis of population baselines (Walker, 2000). For exam-
ple, San Diego Police Department data (Berjarano, 2001) show that.
although African Americans made up only 8% of the city's population
aged 15 years and older, 12% of all traffic stops involved African-Ameri-
can drivers, as did 14%of traffic stops for equipment violations. Similarly,
Zingraff et al. (2000%) reported in their preliminary analysis of traffic
stops by the North Carolina State Highway Patrol that, although African
Americans accounted for 19.6% of North Carolina's licensed drivers,
22.9% of traffic tickets were issued to African Americans (also see Lam-
berth, 1996; Meehan and Ponder, 2001; Vernier0 and Zoubeck, 1999).
However, there is more to Driving While Black than disproportionate
traffic stops. Scholars have also directed attention to the effects of race
and ethnicity on citizen perceptions of "pretextual" traffic stops by police
(Harris, 2002) and to the special problems that accompany encounters
between police and citizens of color (Sykes and Clark, 1975; also see
Weitzer and Tuch, 2002).
"PRETEXTUAL" TRAFFIC STOPS
All drivers routinely violate traffic laws (Harris, 2002; Lamberth, 1996;
Meeks, 2000:25-26; Rubinstein, 1973:l53), and traffic law violations can
therefore serve as a pretext for police motivated by other concerns such as
observation of drivers and passengers for signs of drug use or possession
(Harris, 2002; Fridell et al., 2001; Weitzer and Tuch, 2002). In 1996 in
Whren v. United States (Harris, 2002), the Supreme Court ruled that
pretextual stops are legal if the police officer making the stop can articu-
late a reason grounded in traffic statutes. In the Whren case specifically,
the police officers who made the stop and then found crack cocaine
explained their action by citing a local statute requiring that drivers devote
"full time and attention" (Hall, 1996:2) to their driving.
If police are making pretextual traffic stops, then African-American and
other drivers of color ought logically to exit their traffic stop encounters
perceiving that police did not have a legitimate reason for making the
stop. If police are not using traffic law violations as a pretext for stops, it
could be argued that there should not be any difference between citizens
of color and whites in their perception of the legitimacy of the stops they
experience. However, as we discuss next, other processes influence citi-
zens' perceptions of interactions with police that may either exacerbate
198 LUNDMAN AND KAUFMAN
reactions to police pretext or create a perception of illegitimacy even in
the absence of pretextual actions.
ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN POLICE AND CITIZENS OF COLOR
Police officers enter all of their encounters with citizens expecting that
they will be treated with deference (Sykes and Clark, 1975) and that their
government-backed authority over citizens will be honored (Bittner,
1970). From the perspective of police, the ability to effectively do their
work on a daily basis in ways that routinely fall far short of forceful words
and deeds depends on deference toward police by citizens and citizen
compliance with police requests and demands.
However, encounters between police and citizens of color pose
problems that simply are not present during police encounters with whites
that may affect citizens' perceptions regardless of actual police behavior.
Because most police officers are white (Maguire and Pastore, 1997:39),
African-American and other citizens of color may be reluctant to extend
deference and compliance because it risks conflating a white officer's sta-
tus as a police officer with that officer's position in race and ethnic stratifi-
cation systems that favor whites (Sykes and Clark, 1975). In addition,
police have long brought a far more heavy-handed style of policing to
minority communities and treated African-American and other citizens of
color in those communities with less respect than citizens in white commu-
nities (Anderson, 19YY:320-321; Websdale, 2001). Citizens of color are
therefore understandably more inclined to withhold their best and to be
suspicious of police motives during encounters with police. Last, the per-
vasive racism characteristic of United States society (Entman and Rojecki,
2000; Feagin, 1991) may cause some citizens of color to view their traffic
stop encounters more critically than whites even in the face of police
actions that clearly signal equity, decency, and compassion.
Accordingly, African-American and Hispanic citizens should be less
likely to exit their traffic stop encounters believing police acted legiti-
mately and properly. Because these problems simply are not present dur-
ing traffic stops involving white drivers, whites should more likely exit
their traffic stop encounters believing police acted legitimately and
properly.
LIMITS O F PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Five important limits surround previous research on Driving While
Black. First, because the scholarly study of Driving While Black is rela-
tively new (cf., Weitzer and Tuch, 2002), only a handful of studies currently
exists. Second, many data collection efforts are ongoing (Meeks, 2000:7;
TRAFFIC STOPS AND POLICE ACTIONS 199
Ramirez et al., 2000; Zingraff et al., 2000:4) and more complete under-
standing of Driving While Black must therefore wait until the data cur-
rently being collected are complete and available for scholarly analysis.
Third, extant research as well as the forthcoming analyses are generally
limited to particular police jurisdictions (Lamberth, 1996; Zingraff et al.,
2000) and therefore provide locally rather than nationally representative
answers to questions about Driving While Black. Fourth, existing analyses
and ongoing data collection usually rely on police-reported traffic stops,
with police fully aware of the purpose behind the information gathering
(Berjarano, 2001). Because police officers know this, some have already
been detected falsifying traffic stop information (Donohue, 2000; Meeks,
2000:6-7; Vernier0 and Zoubeck, 1999:31-32). Last, most extant research
on traffic stops and citizen perceptions has not used multivariate tech-
niques to disentangle the effects of race and ethnicity from other possibly
important explanatory variables such as social class (an important excep-
tion is Weitzer and Tuch, 2002).
THE PRESENT RESEARCH
The present research uses Contucts between Police and the Public: Find-
ings from the 1999 Nationul Survey (Langan et al., 2000), which is
grounded exclusively in citizen self-reports of their encounters with police.
Thus, we employ currently available national rather than local data, and
we rely on citizen self-reports rather than police reports to examine how
driver race and ethnicity affect traffic stops by police, citizens' perceptions
of the legitimacy of the traffic stop, and citizens' perceptions of the propri-
ety of police actions during the traffic stop encounter. All of our analyses
are multivariate, controlling for other possibly important predictors.
METHODS
CONTACTS BETWEEN POLICE AND THE PUBLIC DATA AND
CASES
Contacts between Police and the Public: Findings from the 1999 National
Survey (hereafter "CBPP 1999") is a nationally representative sample, and
it was collected as part of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey
(Langan et al., 2001). To be included in CBPP 1999,subjects had to be 16
years of age or older and they first answered a long series of questions
(31% in person and 69% by telephone) about crime victimization and
then a much shorter series of questions lasting 5 to 10minutes about con-
tacts they had with police in the previous 12 months. Of the 80,543 ran-
domly selected subjects, 7,034 (8.7% of the total sample) reported at least
one traffic stop in which they were the driver. Respondents with at least
200 LUNDMAN AND KAUFMAN
one traffic stop were then asked additional questions, including their per-
ception of the legitimacy of the stop and their perception of whether
police acted properly. When subjects reported more than one traffic stop,
they were asked to provide information on the "most recent occasion"
(Langan et al., 2001:35), thereby providing data for all 7,034 drivers with at
least one stop.
DEPENDENT MEASURES
We model three outcomes. The first, Total Traffic Stops,' is a continu-
ous variable and is used to examine traffic stops for Driving While Black.
The sample for this analysis uses the full sample ( N = 80,543). The other
two dependent measures direct attention to possible differences between
drivers of color and white drivers in their perceptions of police actions
associated with the traffic stop. The first, Legitimate Reason for Stop, is
dichotomous (yes = 1, no and missing = 0) and proxies drivers' perceptions
of pretextual traffic stops by police (Harris, 2002). The second, Police
Acted Properly, also is dichotomous (yes = 1, no and missing = 0) and is
used to probe the special problems that accompany traffic stop encounters
between police and citizens of color (Sykes and Clark, 1975). The sample
for analyzing these outcomes is limited to cases with at least one traffic
stop ( N = 7,034).
MODEL ESTIMATION ISSUES AND DATA ANALYSIS
The first dependent measure (Total Traffic Stops) is a count of the num-
ber of traffic stops. As is common for such measures, it has a very dispro-
portionate number of zeros (91.3% of the respondents reported no stops),
and the remainder of the distribution is also very skewed. In this situation,
ordinary least-squares regression is not the appropriate analytic technique
(Long, 1997:217).
We instead use a negative binomial regression model that is specifically
intended for analyzing count outcomes. This technique is an extension of
the Poisson regression model, which relaxes the Poisson's assumption that
the conditional variance of the outcome is equal to the conditional mean
of the outcome (Long, 1997:230). In the analyses below, we tested the
1. There are 5,662 cases with one traffic stop and 1.372 cases with more than one
stop. For 34 of the cases with more than one traffic stop, we know they were stopped
two or more times, but the exact number is not known. In their preliminary analysis.
Langan et al. (2001; also personal communication from Matthew Durose. April 11,
2002) replaced these inexact responses with the mode (two stops) of the multistop sub-
sample. We prefer using the mean (2.83). but because the negative binomial model
requires that the outcome be integer counts, we assigned these cases a value of 3. the
integer closest to the mean of those with multiple stops. However, we ran our models
without these 34 cases and found exactly parallel results to those we report.
TRAFFIC STOPS AND POLICE ACTIONS 201
overdispersion parameter for the negative binomial regressions to deter-
mine if the negative binomial should be used instead of Poisson regression.
As we report for each of the models, the overdispersion parameter esti-
mate is significantly different from zero, indicating that the negative bino-
mial is in fact the better data analytic choice.
The other two outcomes present model estimation issues as well.
Because they are categorical, either logistic regression or probit analysis
are the techniques of choice (Long, 1997:8-40). In addition, these analy-
ses are subject to a sample selection bias (Heckman, 1979) because these
perceptual outcomes are observed only for respondents with at least one
traffic stop (N = 7,034). We first created a dichotomous traffic stop depen-
dent measure (at least one stop = 1, no stops = 0) and attempted to use a
bivariate probit regression model to correct for the selection bias (Greene,
1997:983). However, the bivariate probit models for both perceptual out-
come-dependent measures failed to converge because the estimated error
correlations approached the boundary condition of being perfectly
correlated.
Our solution was to follow the logic of the sample selection correction
methods, which control for a case's likelihood of being selected into the
restricted sample (Berk, 1983). In our case, we use logistic regression
(Kaufman, 1996)and introduce a control for other police contacts (exclud-
ing traffic stops) reported by the respondent. This is a direct measure that
controls for how included respondents differ from each other (and from
excluded respondents) in their chance of experiencing face-to-face
encounters with police and thus of reporting perceptual outcomes.
EXPLANATORY MEASURES
OTHER
POLICE
CONTACT
Respondents who indicated they had experienced a face-to-face contact
with a police officer in the previous 12months were asked to describe that
encounter. Setting aside traffic stops, Other Police Contact represents
non-traffic stop encounters with police (at least one other police contact =
1, no other police contact = 0). As noted, Other Police Contact is included
as a direct and efficient control for sample selection (Berk, 1983). By
measuring the likelihood of face-to-face encounters with police in other
settings, it captures respondents' susceptibility to traffic stops in unmea-
sured ways.
SIZEOF PLACE
Subjects reported where they lived, and CBPP 1999researchers coupled
202 LUNDMAN AND KAUFMAN
this information with census data to place subjects into one of four catego-
ries. We used these categories to construct three size of place dummy vari-
ables: (1) One Million or more (yes = 1,else = 0); (2) 500,000 to 999,999
(yes = 1, else = 0); and (3) 100,000 to 499,999 (yes = 1, else = 0). Popula-
tions of less than 100,000 are the reference category.
We include size of place in our analyses for three reasons. First, most
trips that drivers make take place close to where they live (U.S.Bureau of
the Census, 2001:631), so most traffic stops take place where respondents
live. Second. police officers serving high-population jurisdictions handle
more calls from citizens and consequently have less time for traffic stops
than police officers serving lower population jurisdictions (Bayley, 1994).
Third, police in high-population jurisdictions practice a far more brusque
and impersonal style of policing (Barker, 1999:36) that should affect per-
ceptions of police actions.
DRIVER
SOCIAL
CLASS
Economically advantaged citizens drive more miles each year than less
advantaged citizens, putting the former at greater overall risk of being
stopped by police (Harris, 2002:244, 11. 28; U.S. Bureau of the Census,
2001:631). In addition, limited previous research indicates that police
reserve formal intervention for citizens who appear to be able to bear the
financial costs of formal police actions while simultaneously being more
careful during their encounters with advantaged citizens (Campbell and
Ross, 1968;Chambliss and L i d , 1966; Kinkade and Leone, 1992;Mastrof-
ski and Ritti, 1992). Last, social class affects citizen perceptions of police
and police actions (Weitzer and Tuch, 2002). In sum, this suggests that
higher social class drivers may be more likely to be stopped but less likely
to perceive the stop as illegitimate or improper.
Respondents self-reported income was placed by CBPP 1999 research-
ers into one of three broad categories from which we constructed two
dummy indicators of social class: (1) Above Average Income ($50,000 or
more = yes, else = 0);and (2) Average Income ($20,000 to $49,999 = 1, else
= 0). Below Average Income (less than $20,000 and not answered by
subject2) is the reference category.
DRIVER
AGE
Young drivers are more likely to engage in "risky driving habits" and
thus are more likely to be stopped for traffic law violations (Pfaff-Wright
and Tomaskovic-Devey, 2002:13; U.S. Department of Transportation,
~~ ~
2. In the CBPP 1999 data file, respondents who did not answer the income ques-
tion are not distinguished from those who report income in the lowest category. so they
are included in our samples.
TRAFFIC STOPS AND POLICE ACTIONS 203
2001). We used self-reported age in years to create three dummy vari-
ables: (1) Teen (16 to 19 years = 1, else = 0); (2) Young Adult (20 to 29
years = 1, else = 0); and (3) Adult (30 to 64 years = 1,else = 0), making
Senior (265 years) the reference category.
DRIVER
GENDER
Women engage in fewer risky driving habits than do men (U.S. Depart-
ment of Transportation, 2001) and should be less likely to be stopped for
traffic law violations. Further, most police officers are male (Maguire and
Pastore, 1997:40), and male police officers are more reluctant to stop
female drivers for fear of accusations of misconduct (Rubinstein,
1973:265). This suggests that male officers might make stops of female
drivers only in the face of clear evidence of traffic stop law violations. In
addition, traditional gender role expectations may lead male officers to be
more polite in their interaction with female drivers, while female drivers
may be more inclined to extend deference to male police officers (Sykes
and Clark, 1975590-591). These potential differences are represented in
our models with a dichotomous dummy variable for Female (1 = female, 0
= male).
DRIVER
RACE/ETHNICITY
At the core of Driving While Black is the assertion that police target
African-American and, to a lesser extent, other drivers of color for traffic
stops (Meeks, 2000). Moreover, some scholars argue that police resort to
pretext to stop drivers of color (Harris, 2002), while still others have noted
the special problems that accompany encounters between police and citi-
zens of color (Sykes and Clark, ,1975). If these assertions are true, then
citizens of color should report more traffic stops and be more likely to exit
their traffic stop encounters with police believing that police did not have
a legitimate reason for making the stop and that police did not act
properly.
Respondents indicated whether they considered themselves black, His-
panic, a member of some other race or ethnic group, or white. We used
these self-designations to create three dummy variables: (1) black (yes = 1,
else = 0); (2) Hispanic (yes = 1,else = 0); and (3) Other (American Indian,
Aleut, Eskimo, Asian, Pacific Islander, and other = 1, else = 0). Whites
form the reference category.
DRIVER
RACE/ETHNICITY
BY GENDER
Previous research on Driving While Black indicates that police espe-
cially target African-American men (Harris, 2002; Meeks, 2000; also see
Websdale, 2001:31-32). This suggests that intersections of race/ethnicity
204 LUNDMAN AND KAUFMAN
and gender may be important. We explore this issue using dummy indica-
tors for seven race/ethnicity by gender groupings: (1) Black Female: (2)
Black Male; (3) Hispanic Female; (4) Hispanic Male; (5) Other Female;
(6) Other Male; and (7) White Female. We use White Male as the refer-
ence category. We then use these variables to estimate two models for
each outcome: (1) a "main effects" model including the three dummy
indicators of race/ethnicity plus the dummy indicator of gender; (2) an
"interaction effects" model in which we replace the "main effect" terms
for gender and race/ethnicity with the seven dummy indicators of race/
ethnicity by gender.
RESULTS
TOTAL TRAFFIC STOPS
Table 1 presents the results from the negative binomial regressions for
total number of traffic stops. In both models, the effects are consistent
and expected. Starting with the predictors other than race and ethnicity,
Other Police Contact has a significant positive effect on the number of
traffic stops, verifying that this selectivity measure (Berk, 1983) captures
how respondents differ in their chances of experiencing traffic stops. The
expected number of stops declines across each contrast of larger to smaller
population size, which corresponds to the argument that police have less
time for traffic stops in higher population jurisdictions (Bayley, 1994).
Affluent drivers are stopped more often by police, consistent with both
their higher driving mileage (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001:631) and
with previous research (Campbell and Ross, 1968; Kinkade and Leone,
1992). And, consistent with risky driving habits rooted firmly in age and
gender (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2001), young drivers are
stopped significantly more often, while female drivers are stopped signifi-
cantly less often. The latter likewise follows from arguments that male
police officers are more reluctant to stop female drivers (Rubinstein,
1973:265).
Model 1 in Table 1 also provides a first look at the effects of driver race/
ethnicity. Black drivers report significantly more traffic stops than do
white drivers. In contrast, Hispanic and other drivers report significantly
fewer traffic stops by police. Model 2 in Table 1 shows that the race/
ethnicity by gender effects are important as well (Harris, 2002; also see
Websdale, 2001:31-32); the change in chi-square between the models is
significant (20.88 with 3 df), indicating that the race/ethnicity by gender
interactions are needed. Specifically, model 2 shows that African-Ameri-
can men report more stops than do white men. All of the other race/
ethnicity-gender group predictors in model 2, however, are negative and
significant, indicating that these groups have fewer stops than white men.

But these effects show a consistent pattern of differences by both race/
ethnicity and gender. Within race/ethnicity groups, men report a higher
number of stops than do women. Within gender, African Americans have
the highest number of expected stops, followed by whites, then Hispanics,
and then others. Like African-American men relative to white men, Afri-
can-American women may be targeted in comparison to white women, but
the difference is small and not significant.
LEGITIMATE REASON FOR STOP
Some scholars argue that police use pretext (Harris, 2002; Meeks, 2000)
to stop African-American and other drivers of color for minor traffic law
violations that otherwise would be ignored. The Legitimate Reason for
Stop outcome partially probes this argument using drivers' perceptions of
the legitimacy of the traffic stop they experienced. Both models in Table 2
support this argument. Model 1 shows that African Americans and His-
panics are significantly less likely to think that police had a legitimate rea-
son for stopping them. At the same time, the difference between others
and whites is negative but not significant, and women are more likely than
TRAFFIC STOPS AND POLICE ACTIONS 207
men to report that the stop was legitimate (Sykes and Clark,
Model 2 shows a slightly more complex pattern when we consider the
interaction between race/ethnicity and gender. Within race/ethnicity,
there is a consistent effect of gender. Men are less likely to believe that
the stop was legitimate than are women. Within gender, the effects of
race/ethnicity are slightly different. Among men, African-American men
are the least likely to think that the stop was legitimate, followed by His-
panics and then others, with white men the most likely to perceive legiti-
macy. Among women, the ordering is the same, except for Hispanic
women. Hispanic women are the most likely to accept the legitimacy of
the stop.
Turning to the other sets of predictors, all but age have significant
effects. Drivers with at least one other police contact are significantly less
likely to report that police had a legitimate reason for making a traffic
stop. This indicates that stopped drivers are not representative of the ini-
tial sample (Greene, 1997:983) and demonstrates the importance of con-
trolling for sample selection. Drivers in larger places are less likely than
those in smaller places to report a legitimate reason for their traffic stop,
suggesting that police in higher population jurisdictions do practice a more
brusque and impersonal style of policing (Barker, 199936). Finally, driv-
ers with above average and average incomes are significantly more likely
to report a legitimate reason for their stop, consistent with the argument
that police are more careful in their actions when citizens are affluent
(Campbell and Ross, 1968;Chambliss and Liell, 1966;Kinkade and Leone,
1992; Mastrofski and Ritti, 1992).
197S:S90-S91).
POLICE ACTED PROPERLY
Previous research (Sykes and Clark, 1975) suggests that special
problems are associated with encounters between police and citizens of
color. Models 3 and 4 in Table 2 show that is indeed the case. In the
additive race/ethnicity and gender effects model, African-American and
Hispanic drivers are significantly less likely than Whites to report that the
police acted properly, and women are more likely than men to report that
police acted properly. As was the case for the pretextual outcome, the
interaction between gender and race/ethnicity is more complex. Within
gender, African Americans are the least likely to believe that police acted
properly and whites are the most likely to think so. Hispanics and others
fall in the middle but in opposite orders for men and women. Within race/
ethnicity, the gender effect is the same with women more likely than men
to believe that the police acted properly, except for those of other race/
ethnicity for whom the gender difference reverses but is not significant.

With respect to the other predictors, the effects are as expected. Driv-
ers in the biggest city places, for instance, are significantly less likely to
report proper police actions (Barker, 1999:36). Similarly, drivers with
above average and average incomes are significantly more likely to report
that police acted properly (Mastrofski and Ritti, 1992). And the selectivity
control has a significant negative effect, suggesting that non-traffic contact
with police is associated with a more negative perception of police actions.
The analyses in Table 2 confirm that there is more to Driving While
Black than being targeted for traffic stops by police. African-American
and Hispanic drivers are more likely to report that police did not have a
legitimate reason to stop them, thereby suggesting more frequent police
recourse to pretext when stopping drivers of color (Harris, 2002). African-
210 LUNDMAN AND KAUFMAN
American and Hispanic drivers also are less likely to report that police
acted properly, confirming prior research that special problems arise dur-
ing encounters between police and citizens of color (Sykes and Clark,
1975). The broad pattern that emerges, however, is one in which African
Americans and whites have starkly different perceptions of police actions.
DISCUSSION
Our results are clear. Based on citizen self-reports, police are signifi-
cantly more likely to stop African-American male drivers and there is a
similar patterning of stops by race/ethnicity for both men and women.
Further, African-American and Hispanic drivers are significantly less
likely to report that police had a legitimate reason for making the stop and
significantly less likely to report that police acted properly. And, although
the reactions of Hispanics and others vary somewhat by gender, beliefs in
the legitimacy and propriety of police actions are framed by a polarity
between blacks and whites.
The implications of these patterns are troubling, regardless of whether
they result from differential treatment of drivers of color by the police,
from differential perceptions of and reactions to police by citizens of color,
or, perhaps most likely, from both. It is one thing when ordinary white
citizens use race and ethnicity to shape their daily activities, resort to pre-
text as the basis for their actions, and leave unattended the special
problems associated with encounters between themselves and citizens of
color (Anderson, 1999: Feagin, 1991). It is quite another when citizens
report that many police, most of whom also are white (Maguire and Pas-
tore, 1997:39),use race to shape their daily work, resort to pretext, and fail
to defuse their encounters with citizens of color. Police are not ordinary
citizens but instead are powerful actors who are always situationally cor-
rect (Bittner, 1970). In the context of traffic stops, police are actors who
are able to stop citizens from driving without their consent, even if the
reason for the stop is pretextual. Police are also actors who are able to
prevent citizens from resuming their driving unless and until the police
officer who made the stop gives permission, even if the officer is not acting
properly. Because they are enormously powerful and always situationally
correct, police are expected to be commonweal actors (Blau and Scott,
196254-57) and, as such, better than ordinary citizens. However, the
results of the present research suggest that many police nationally may be
ignoring their commonweal obligations by acting just like ordinary citizens
or, alternatively. are unable or unwilling to defuse and counter the suspi-
cion with which police actions are viewed by many drivers of color.
TRAFFIC STOPS AND POLICE ACTIONS 211
ARE CITIZEN SELF-REPORTS OF THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH
POLICE VALID?
The CBPP 1999consists of nothing more nor less than citizen answers to
survey questions. Moreover, because it has a large and nationally repre-
sentative sample, other scholars almost certainly will turn to it, to subse-
quent CBPP surveys, and to other citizen self-report data to analyze police
and policing (Pfaff-Wright and Tomaskovic-Devey, 2000; Weitzer and
Tuch, 2002). In contrast, most existing research on police has been
grounded in data collected by trained observers (for reviews, see Riksheim
and Chermak, 1993; Sherman, 1980). Accordingly, the major issue sur-
rounding the present research and other analyses using citizen self-report
data revolves around a very simple question. Are citizen self-reports of
their encounters with police valid? The remainder of this section
addresses this issue, starting with the case for validity and continuing with
whether validity is in fact a pivotal issue. It also includes an agenda for
future research and the need for triangulation.
THECASEFOR VALIDITY
It is useful to begin discussion of citizen self-reports by noting that there
is nothing unusual about scholars using data from citizens in their analyses
of crime, criminals, and criminal justice (see Farrington et al., 1996; Gras-
mick et al., 1993). Uniform Crime Reports data, for example, rest funda-
mentally on self-reports by citizens because it is their calls that alert police
that an index crime has been committed. By their calls, citizens therefore
make index crimes visible and make arrests for both index and nonindex
crimes possible (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2000:iv). In victimiza-
tion surveys, citizens report whether they experienced a criminal victimiza-
tion, indicate whether they reported that victimization to police, and, for
victims of crimes against persons, describe the people who committed the
crimes they experienced (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2001). Similarly, in
self-report studies of criminal offenders, subjects describe their own
involvement in particular crimes, including traffic law violations and
whether they were arrested or ticketed by police (Bachman et al., 2001).
When viewed through these lenses, using citizen self-reports of their
encounters with police simply extends a long-standing scholarly practice of
using data from citizens on crime, criminals, and criminal justice.
In addition, no matter whether data are drawn from Uniform Crime
Reports, victimization surveys, or self-report studies (Bachman et al., 2001:
Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2001; Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2000),
the images citizens advance converge on common substance. With respect
to crime, for instance, citizens consistently report that most crime is
212 LUNDMAN AND KAUFMAN
nonindex crime and that most index crime is property crime, especially
larceny theft.
Moreover, the results from our analyses of citizens' self-reports of polic-
ing mesh with the manners and customs of police (Black, 1980) that schol-
ars have observed on three important dimensions. First, police are legal
actors sensitive to legal factors (Barker, 1999). Because traffic law viola-
tions are more common among young drivers and male drivers (US.
Department of Transportation, 2001), traffic stops should disproportion-
ately involve young drivers and men. Second, past research indicates that
police in high-population jurisdictions make fewer traffic stops (Bayley,
1994) and practice a far more brusque and impersonal style of policing
that should logically increase the odds of citizen dissatisfaction with police
actions (Barker, 1999:36). Third, police have long been more careful with
economically privileged citizens (Chambliss and Liell, 1966), making cer-
tain they have clearer grounds for intervention and being more careful in
their interaction with people who have platform and voice (Mastrofski and
Ritti, 1992). Our results precisely parallel the results of past studies of
police and policing: (1) young and male drivers report more stops; (2) driv-
ers in higher population areas report fewer stops and are more likely to
report dissatisfaction with police: and (3) drivers are more likely to report
satisfaction with police if they are economically privileged.
Underreporting by African Americans. The literature teaches that Afri-
can Americans are more likely to underreport official trouble with the law
than are whites (Sudman and Bradburn. 1982), including traffic stops
(Clark and Tifft, 1966). Pfaff-Wright and Tomaskovic-Devey's (2000:4)
data are typical. Among North Carolina drivers known to have been
stopped by police for speeding, three-quarters of whites admitted to being
stopped as compared to two-thirds of African Americans.
Such patterns of underreporting may have an important implication for
the present research. If these findings do in fact apply to the CBPP 1999
data, then the significantly higher rates of traffic stops self-reported by
African-American men are even more robust than they appear. However,
there is no certainty that this pattern applies to the data we examined
because not all analyses of self-report data reveal differences between
whites and African Americans (Farrington et al., 1996).
Is VALIDITY
EVENA PIVOTAL
ISSCJE?
The present research, however, does not exclusively rise or fall on the
validity of citizen self-reports. Instead, it is possible to argue that validity
is simply not a pivotal issue and still make a strong case that the results of
the present research are profoundly consequential.
More than 70 years ago, sociologists W. I. Thomas and Dorothy Swaine
TRAFFIC STOPS AND POLICE ACTIONS 213
Thomas (1928572) taught scholars: "[ilf . . . [people] . . . define situations
as real, then they are real in their consequences." More recently, Weitzer
and Tuch (2002:436) applied the same argument to citizen reports of traffic
stops: "Citizen perceptions of police stops may be considered just as
important as the objective reality of such stops. Stops perceived as racially
motivated may increase the frequency of confrontations between police
and motorists and generate distrust of the police among those who are
stopped."
When the CBPP 1999 data used in the present research are examined in
light of these important scholarly lessons, validity emerges as a less pivotal
issue than otherwise would appear to be the case. Consider first how the
respondents of color in our analyses define their traffic stop encounters
with police: (1) African-American men are targeted for traffic stops by
police; (2) traffic stops of African-American and Hispanic drivers are
more likely to be grounded in pretext; and (3) police fail to defuse the
special problems associated with their encounters with African-American
and Hispanic drivers.
Consider next the consequences of these situational definitions. These
definitions link the long history of police control and oppression of Afri-
can Americans in southern and northern cities (Websdale, 2001) with per-
ceptions of contemporary police control and oppression of African-
American and Hispanic drivers on state and local highways and streets
(Meeks, 2000). These situational definitions reinforce and reflect African
Americans' and Hispanics' deeply held beliefs that police have two styles
of policing, one much less legitimate and proper for them and another
much more legitimate and proper for whites (Anderson, 1999;Weitzer and
Tuch, 2002). These definitions mean African-American and Hispanic
adults warn teenage children not just about the dangers of driving while
young (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2001), but also about the spe-
cial dangers of Driving While Black and Brown (Harris, 2002:107-115).
And these definitions mean that our cities remain, as the Kerner Commis-
sion (1968:~)warned more than 30 years ago, tinder boxes waiting to
ignite during the next traffic stop encounter between police and a driver of
color (also see Skolnick and Fyfe, 1993:l-22).
FUTURE RESEARCH
Extant research on Driving While Black is extremely limited (for a
review, see Harris, 2002), and very few studies have used multivariate
analyses (an important exception is Weitzer and Tuch, 2002). With only a
limited number of carefully crafted analyses, researchers have no firm
sense of the consistent patterns in the mosaic (Becker, 1966:viii) of schol-
arly understandings of Driving While Black.
214 LUNDMAN A N D KAUFMAN
The most pressing need, accordingly, is additional research on the fac-
tors affecting traffic stops by police. Social science scholars are currently
serving as consultants to law enforcement organizations and helping to
collect police-reported data on traffic stops (cf., Portland Police Bureau,
2000). Considerable data will therefore become available for analysis in
the relatively near future, and scholars have already shown the usefulness
of police-reported data (Zingraff et al., 2000).
However, as is the case with citizen-reported data (Pfaff-Wright and
Tomoskovic-Devey. 2000), police-reported data raise questions about
validity. In particular, it is easy for police to distort the traffic stop data
they report, and some officers have already been detected doing precisely
that (Donohue, 2000; Meeks, 2000:6-7; Vernier0 and Zoubeck.
1999:31-32). Moreover, police-reported data do not capture citizen per-
ceptions of the legitimacy of traffic stops nor citizen perceptions of the
propriety of police actions. It would therefore be a mistake for scholars to
base their understandings of Driving While Black exclusively on the exten-
sive police-reported data that will soon become available.
TRIANGIJLATED
DATAAS T H E SOLlJ.I'ION
The solution is triangulated data (Singleton and Straits, 1999404-405;
Webb et al., 1966:173-174) and to complement police-reported data with
two additional types of data. The present research used one of those com-
plementary data sources-citizen self-reports (also see Pfaff-Wright and
Tomaskovic-Devey, 2000; Weitzer and Tuch, 2002). The other comple-
mentary data source is to train the observers who collected so much of the
scholarly data on police and policing in the past (for reviews, see Riksheim
and Chermak, 1993; Sherman, 1980) to observe and record the race and
ethnicity of the many traffic law violators whom police witness but choose
to leave alone and the demeanor of police, not just citizens (Klinger,
1994), during their encounters with drivers whom they do stop.
An agenda for future research is therefore clear. Scholars should con-
tinue to collect police-reported data on traffic stops (cf., Zingraff et al.,
2000) and to collect and examine citizen reports of traffic stops (Pfaff-
Wright and Tomaskovic-Devey, 2000; Weitzer and Tuch, 2002). But they
also must expand the training of observers of police to include coding not
just traffic stops and the actions and demeanor of police and drivers during
stops, but also the race and ethnicity of traffic law violators observed by
police but left alone. And, with these triangulated data in hand, research-
ers can then explore the similarities and isolate and explain the differences
that arise from using police-reported, citizen-reported. and observer-
reported data to describe and explain the phenomenon of Driving While
Black.
TRAFFIC STOPS AND POLICE ACTIONS 215
CONCLUSIONS
The present research supports five conclusions. First, citizens report
that police nationally make traffic stops more frequently of African-Amer-
ican male drivers. More broadly, for both women and men, there is an
identical pattern of stops by race/ethnicity. Second, African-American
drivers (both men and women) as well as Hispanic male drivers are signifi-
cantly less likely than white men to report that police had a legitimate
reason for making the traffic stop, thereby suggesting either police
recourse to pretext when stopping drivers of color or varying situational
definitions between whites and citizens of color, or both. Third, African-
American men and Hispanic men are significantly less likely than white
men to report that police acted properly during the traffic stop encounter
(as are African-Americanwomen compared with white women), thus rein-
forcing the existence of special problems associated with encounters
between police and citizens of color. Fourth, although the reactions of
Hispanics and others vary somewhat by gender, beliefs in the legitimacy
and propriety of police actions are framed by a stark polarity between
African Americans and whites. Most importantly, there is a pressing need
and ample scholarly room for additional research on Driving While Black
using triangulated police-reported, citizen-reported, and observer-
reported data.
