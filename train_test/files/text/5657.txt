Introduction
The period 1987 to 2000 was one of very active education
policy reforms in Ghana. This was the period when the three
Ministry of Education (MOE) "Strategic Objectives,"
namely, improving access to and participation in basic edu-
cation, improving the quality of teaching and learning, and
improving the management efficiency of the education sec-
tor, were formulated to inform and facilitate the implementa-
tion of the various education sector policies in the country.
This period, essentially, was characterized by Ghana's par-
ticipation in and endorsement of international and multilat-
eral agreements and conventions such as the United Nations
(UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the
World Declaration on Education for All (EFA) Conference,
the Beijing Declaration on Women's Rights, the Lome
Convention, and World Education Forum (or what is com-
monly referred to as the Dakar Framework for Action or the
Millennium Development Goals Conference).
Ghana's endorsement of the agreements and declarations
of these international meetings, coupled with commitments
to her own internal constitutional reforms, for example, led
to major constitutional and educational reforms of which the
Free Compulsory Universal Basic Education (fCUBE) pol-
icy was a formidable part (Nudzor, 2012). The Fourth
Republican Constitution of 1992 and the policy acts that
followed it set the stage for the national provision of basic
education (Maikish & Gershberg, 2008). The 1992 constitu-
tion formulated the policy titled "Basic Education--A Right:
Programme for the provision of Free Compulsory and
Universal Basic Education by the year 2005," which was
launched officially by MOE in 1996 (Government of Ghana
[GOG], 1992; MOE/Ghana Education Service [GES], 2001).
A year after (that is, in 1997), a fourth objective, decen-
tralization and sustainability of management structures, was
added to the three strategic objectives formulated to guide
the execution of the fCUBE policy implementation and gen-
erally education policy formulation and implementation in
the country. The objective of the decentralization component
of fCUBE includes decentralizing the management of the
education sector's budget for pre-tertiary education to
District Assemblies (DAs). This involves capacity building
and financial management at the district level (GES, 2004).
Thus, historically speaking, although attempts to decentral-
ize the general administration of Ghana dated back to the era

An Analytical Review of Education Policy-
Making and Implementation Processes
Within the Context of "Decentralized
System of Administration" in Ghana
Hope Pius Nudzor1
Abstract
A critical assessment of education policy and practice in Ghana suggests that despite the initiation of the concept of
decentralization, education policy making and implementation is still perceived as adopting a hierarchical structure with its
inherent practice of concentration of power at the center. This article conducts an analytical review of the processes of
education policy making and implementation within the context of decentralized system of administration in Ghana. This is
done with the view to illuminating the theoretical and practical challenges and limitations that this "top-down" and rationalist
approach to policy processes imposes on the functioning of the education system. In pursuit of this agenda, useful proposals
for democratizing and decentralizing the processes of policy formulation and implementation are presented. The article
contends that this critical review is necessary to provide analytic information for facilitating and informing national education
policy dialogue and policy formulation to improve the Ghanaian education system.

of the introduction of indirect rule by the British colonial
regime (Ayee, 2000), the strategy of education decentraliza-
tion as the fourth strategic objective of fCUBE was aimed
specifically at shifting responsibility of education decision
making into the hands of local education authorities. To do
this, the strategy sought to devolve central administrative
authority and divest implementation responsibility to the dis-
trict level. As Maikish and Gershberg, citing the National
Decentralisation Action Plan (NDAP) (GOG, 2003), rightly
note, the policy of decentralization in Ghana (which receives
the necessary legal impetus from Chapter 20, Article 240 of
the 1992 Constitution [GOG, 1992]; Act 462 of the 1993
Local Government Act [GOG, 2003]; as well as from several
other subsequent policy acts) aimed to establish a decentral-
ized administration through the transfer of power from the
central government to sub-national institutions such as DAs
"to enhance the capacity of the public sector to plan, manage
and monitor social, spatial and economic development"
(p. 2).
The policy acts (e.g., Chapter 20, Article 240 of the 1992
Constitution; Local Government Law 207; Act 462 of the
1993 Local Government Act; and several other subsequent
legal frameworks) that brought to being the strategic objec-
tive of decentralization are still in force, and some reason-
able amount of efforts are perceived to have been made and
are still being made to decentralize education policy making
to the local and/or district levels. Unfortunately however, a
critical assessment of education policy and practice in Ghana
generally suggests in rather stark terms that despite the initia-
tion and adoption of the strategic objective of decentraliza-
tion, education policy making and implementation is still
perceived as adopting a hierarchical structure with its inher-
ent practice of concentration of power at the center. Policy is
still largely formulated at the national level by political fig-
ureheads and technocrats and "pushed down" for implemen-
tation at the local level through regional and district
representatives of the Ghanaian education authority. While
this "top-down" rationalist approach to the policy process
arguably has its own merits, the practice does raise a number
of interesting questions worth examining. For example, the
question does arise as to how the concept of educational
decentralization can take hold when policy making remains
the preserve of political figureheads and technocrats at the
top echelons of the policy process? Conversely, the question
also comes to mind as to how or the extent to which this
rationalist approach ensures the avoidance of adoption of the
straitjacket of external accountability which favors imposi-
tion of change from the "center."
This article seeks to respond, although indirectly, to these
and other concerns and challenges that confront the Ghanaian
education system as a result of the adoption of the rationalist
approach to policy making. In particular, the article analyzes
critically the practice of education policy making and imple-
mentation within the context of "decentralized system of
administration" in Ghana. This is done with the view to
illuminating the potential theoretical and practical challenges
and limitations that this "top-down" approach to the policy
imposes on the functioning of the education system. In pur-
suit of this goal, the article presents proposals for democra-
tizing and decentralizing the processes of policy making and
implementation. Essentially, the article argues that Ghana's
interest and focus on strengthening central government con-
trol at the local levels rather than the focus on devolution has
encouraged education policy making and implementation to
assume the managerial "top-down" posture, causing educa-
tional decentralization structures and institutions and their
local governance counterparts to operate as dual hierarchical
and parallel structures. Consequently, and as the article con-
tends, education policy has come to be conceptualized and
reduced to simplistic routines of decision making rather than
a complex undertaking involving contestations, struggles,
and negotiations between and among the various actors of
policy.
The article is organized as follows. The next section sets
the article in context by describing crisply some underlying
drivers and concepts of decentralization vis-à-vis a brief his-
tory of the initiation of the policy of decentralization in
Ghana. This is followed by detailed description of education
policy-making and implementation processes in the Ghanaian
context. Thereafter, the theoretical and practical challenges
and limitations imposed on the Ghanaian education system
by the top-down and rationalist approach to policy making
are presented. Then, proposals for democratizing education
policy processes are highlighted before the summary and
conclusion.
Decentralization: Underlying Drivers
and Concepts
The preponderance of available evidence from empirical
studies and literature on public administration suggests that
decentralization entails and/or could be defined generally as
any act in which a central government formally cedes its
power and authority to sub-national and diversified levels of
the governance arrangement (Ayee, 2000; Crawford, 2004;
Devas, 2005; Egbenya, 2010; Gariba, 2009; etc.). In other
words, decentralization as a concept concerns the transfer of
authority in public planning, management, and decision
making from national and/or central levels to sub-national
levels (Rondinelli cited by Egbenya, 2010) with the view to
achieving positive outcomes in both democratic and devel-
opmental terms (Crawford, 2004).
A remarkable empirical evidence from the various studies
on decentralization (e.g., Coulson, 1995; Crook, 2003;
Devas, 2005; Olowu & Wunsch, 2004; Shah & Thompson,
2004; Wunsch, 2001) exemplify the very many and valid
economic, political, administrative, and conflict resolution
arguments for decentralization. For example, while in some
countries (particularly central and eastern Europe and Latin
America) the drive for decentralization came from demands
Nudzor 3
from local levels as a reaction against the failures of the cen-
tralized state, in some other parts of the world, decentraliza-
tion of the state has been a response to actual or potential
regional conflict (e.g., Indonesia) and/or as a way of recon-
structing states afflicted by conflict arising from ethnic
diversity (e.g., Uganda, South Africa, Iraq). However, in
reality, the process in most countries (especially countries in
sub-Saharan Africa) has generally been driven by local and
national political elites, by certain political realities at the
center, and by "external pressures," rather than by local-level
democratic demand (Devas, 2005, p. 3). Thus raising further
the critical issue about whether or not governance institu-
tions at the local levels have the capacity to offer the prospect
of increased accountability to citizens through the greater
accessibility of decision making.
Three main types of decentralization, namely, administra-
tive decentralization or deconcentration, fiscal decentraliza-
tion, and political/democratic decentralization or devolution,
are also discernible from a critical review of the literature
(Ayee, 2000; Crawford, 2004; Manor, 1995; Nkrumah, 2000;
Ribot, 2001). Administrative decentralization or deconcen-
tration, as illustrated in the literature, involves the relocation
of branches of the central state to local areas, entailing a
transfer of power to locally based officials who remain part
of, and upwardly accountable to, central government minis-
tries and agencies. Fiscal decentralization, however, entails
the transfer of fiscal resources and revenue-generating pow-
ers, inclusive of authority over budgets and financial deci-
sions, to either deconcentrated officials and/or central
government appointees or to elected politicians. The third
type of decentralization (i.e., political/democratic decentral-
ization or devolution), according to the public administration
literature, is concerned essentially with the transfer of pow-
ers and resources to sub-national authorities who are largely
or wholly independent of the central government and are
democratically elected (Manor, 1995, cited by Crawford,
2004).
While these remain the commonly identifiable types of
decentralization in the literature, it is worth noting for the
purposes of this article that two competing concepts of
decentralization appear to be operating in the Ghanaian con-
text currently (Gariba, 2009). The first is the devolution of
major political and administrative responsibilities from cen-
tral Government to DAs, comprising the establishment of
partially elected bodies with the mandate for local govern-
ment and local community development. The second, run-
ning parallel to the concept of devolution, entails the process
of administrative and technical deconcentration practiced by
Ministries, Departments, and Agencies that plan and deliver
specific services (such as water and sanitation, health, educa-
tion, agriculture, roads, works) and other allied municipal
services. Devolution, as set out under the former illustration,
has far reaching implications for political, administrative,
and technical setup, proposing to restructure institutions and
mandates for service delivery. Deconcentration as illustrated
in the latter case has involved the simpler re-arrangement of
the locations of key personnel and where their functions are
delivered, while retaining the loyalties, promotion incen-
tives, and the "chain of command" of the centralized agen-
cies (Gariba, 2009, p. 6). This second entrenched concept
and/or process of deconcentration depicts, to a large extent,
Ghana's interest and attempt at decentralization all along and
is aimed at strengthening central government control at the
local level (Ayee, 2000).
Decentralization in Ghana: A Brief
Historical Account
The history of decentralization in Ghana dates back from the
introduction of indirect rule by the British colonial authori-
ties in 1878 (Ayee, 2000) and has run through the pre and
post-independence eras to the current democratic and "Fourth
Republican" dispensation. During the period of colonialism,
the British administration ruled indigenes indirectly through
the native political chieftaincy system. They (i.e., the British
colonial authorities) set up a native political institution
whereby chiefs and elders in given districts were constituted
as local authorities with powers "to establish treasuries,
appoint staff and perform local government functions"
(Nkrumah, 2000, cited in Crawford, 2004, p. 6). Under this
system of administration, according to Crawford (2004), the
democratic ideals underlying chieftaincy in Ghana, which
made chiefs accountable to their subjects was replaced by
upward accountability to the colonial "master." This was
because, and as Nkrumah (2000) for example, notes, "the
recognition by the central government was more crucial to
the chief than support of his people" (p. 5).
In the periods after this (i.e., the period immediately
before, during, and after Ghana's independence in 1957),
local government generally was weak and subject to the cen-
tralization of power that was typical of most post-colonial
states inAfrica. Several attempts at decentralizing the admin-
istration of the country, for example, the decentralization
reforms introduced in 1974 under the military regime of Lt.
Col. Acheampong, were generally characterized by decon-
centration and aimed at strengthening central government
control at the local level. A historical aspect during these
eras, nonetheless, was the decentralization reforms intro-
duced in the early period of Rawlings's military regime (i.e.,
1981-1992). In 1983, Rawlings's Provisional National
Defence Council (PNDC) government announced a policy of
administrative decentralization of central government minis-
tries, alongside the creation of People's Defence Committees
(PDCs) in each town and village. The PDCs, made up of
local PNDC activists as self-identified defenders of the "rev-
olution," effectively took over local government responsi-
bilities,thoughoftenlimitedtomobilizingtheimplementation
of local self-help projects (Nkrumah, cited in Crawford,
2004, p. 7), while the deconcentrated ministries played a
more significant role. While this policy reform was
4 SAGE Open
remarkable in terms of its "politico-historical antecedents,"
Ayee (2000, p. 49) notes that the PNDC government's inter-
est in decentralization reflected that of previous regimes. He
argues that its interest was not the devolution of political
authority to the local level but rather in the administrative
decentralization of central government.
The most significant push toward decentralization in
post-independence Ghana however occurred in 1988 when
the PNDC government introduced a major piece of legisla-
tive reform, "the Local Government Law 207" (also known
as PNDC Law 207). The introduction of this Law saw the
creation of 110 designated administrative districts (ADs)
within Ghana's 10 regions, with non-partisan DA elections
held initially in 1988/89 and subsequently every 4 years. In
addition to the two thirds of DA members elected on an indi-
vidual, non-partisan basis, one third was appointed by cen-
tral government, along with a chief executive for each
district. The stated aim of the 1988 Local Government Law
(according to Map Consult Ltd, 2002), was "to promote pop-
ular participation and ownership of the machinery of govern-
ment . . . by devolving power, competence and resource/
means to the district level" (p. 35). According to Crawford
(2004, p. 8), the language of "participation" and "owner-
ship," interestingly anticipated the "donor speak" of the
1990s (particularly World Bank), although it had some reso-
nance also with the revolutionary rhetoric of "popular par-
ticipation" of the earlier PNDC period.
The 1988 decentralization reform was endorsed by
Ghana's Fourth Republican Constitution of 1992 which
marked the transition to multiparty democracy at the national
level. The 1992 Constitution consolidated the aim of decen-
tralization within the overall context of a liberal democratic
constitution. The objective of decentralization as laid out
unambiguously in Chapter 20, Article 240, Sub-sections 1
and 2 of the 1992 Constitution states emphatically that
Local government and administration . . . shall . . . be
decentralised. . . . The functions, powers, responsibilities and
resources should be transferred from Central Government to
local government units. . . . Measures should be taken [by
Parliament] to enhance the capacity of local government
authorities to plan, initiate, co-ordinate, manage and execute
policies in respect of matters affecting local people. (GOG,
1992)
The principles of local government participation and
downward accountability to the populace are inferred in the
provision in Article 240[2][e]) of 1992 Constitution that
To ensure the accountability of local government authorities,
people in particular local government areas shall, as far as
practicable, be afforded the opportunity to participate effectively
in their governance. (GOG, 1992)
Currently, these constitutional provisions regarding
decentralization are further deepened under President
John Mahama's National Democratic Congress (NDC)
Government through the adherence to the three-tier sub-
national structure created by the 1992 Constitution. This
three-tier sub-national structure comprises Regional
Co-ordinating Councils (RCCs), ADs (or what is known in
general terms as DAs), and Sub-District Structures. Each of
the 10 regions has a RCC, chaired by a regional minister,
appointed by the president. The RCC is composed of the
regional minister and his or her deputy, the presiding mem-
ber and District Chief Executive (DCE) from each district,
two chiefs from the Regional House of Chiefs, and regional
heads of decentralized ministries in the region who sit as
nonvoting members. The RCC's main functions are to co-
ordinate and regulate the DAs in their respective regions.
The DAs, as per the 1992 Constitution, the Local Government
Act, and other previous policy acts/laws, are responsible for
the overall development of districts and are, among other
things, permitted to exercise deliberative, legislative, and
executive functions. Currently, the number of DAs/ADs has
been increased from 110 to 216 comprising 6 Metropolitan
Assemblies, 55 Municipal Assemblies, and 155 DAs. The
third-tier (i.e., sub-district structures) of the sub-national
structure, consist of Urban, Zonal and Town/Area Councils,
and Unit Committees, who are essentially implementing
agencies of DAs and are what Ayee (2000) describes as "ral-
lying point of local enthusiasm in support of the develop-
ment objectives of DAs" (p. 17).
In all, the objective of decentralization, along with the key
powers and responsibilities enshrined in sub-national gov-
ernment structures, as can be seen above, is clearly estab-
lished in and/or by the Fourth Republican Constitution of
1992. Yet, certain essential democratic elements of decen-
tralization appear to remain compromised. As this article,
using the education system as case in point, will later show,
sub-national educational institutions and structures in Ghana
lack the necessary wherewithal to enact their own policies
owing mainly to the hierarchical structure of the education
system. This state of affairs does not enable the educational
system to engage effectively with local governance institu-
tions. Ayee (2000), for example, endorses this argument
forcefully. He contends that a key feature of local gover-
nance in Ghana is the adoption of a dual hierarchical struc-
ture in which central government institutions and local
counterparts (including education) "operate in parallel" (p.
49), but with encroachment many at times by better-resourced
central government on the roles and responsibilities of under-
resourced local government.
Education Policy Making in Ghana: The
Narrative
Education policy making in the Ghanaian context adopts the
traditional rationalist model whereby policy formulation pro-
gresses through phases, namely, conception, consultation,
development, implementation, and evaluation stages
(Working Group on Education Sector Analysis, 2000).1 The
process begins with perceived or felt need for changes in the
Nudzor 5
education provision and delivery systems. Such changes are
necessitated by and/or for various reasons such as the find-
ings of research on ineffectiveness and/or failure of a partic-
ular education policy or the recognition that a particular
educational reform program is no longer appropriate or has
outlived its usefulness. Similarly, policy-making initiatives
are also prompted by the concern to fulfill earlier promises
made, especially by politicians, seeking the votes of the elec-
torates, or in some cases, the need to supplement, strengthen,
or address weaknesses in existing policies to improve
conditions.
In the Ghanaian context, the practice at the conception
stage of the policy-making process is to respond to demands
for change by first setting up a national committee or com-
mission, with membership from a wide range of stakeholder
organizations, to review the situation warranting change
(Working Group on Education Sector Analysis, 2000). The
review at this stage is expected to draw heavily on the analy-
sis of the experiences gained in the implementation of exist-
ing policies that are the focus or targets of the proposed
change. The main concern of the review at this stage is not
only to find out why targets of existing policies are not being
achieved and whether implementation has gone on as
planned. The task here, equally importantly, involves exam-
ining what unintended outcomes or unforeseen obstacles
have emerged during the process of implementing existing
policies which are the target of change, and what alternative
measures can be adopted to address existing challenges. A
good example to illustrate policy formulation at the concep-
tion stage (and typically how demands for educational
change are responded to in Ghana) is the setting up of the
Education Reform Review Committee of 1993/1994 with the
mandate to review Ghana's policies on basic education. The
activities of this Committee culminated in the initiation and
implementation of fCUBE policy and/or program in 1996.
The consultation stage of education policy-making pro-
cess in Ghana solicits views for the purpose of review by
government. An essential part of the task here involves con-
sidering which options are available or are still open to the
sector while taking into account the past experiences and the
extent to which the sector has drifted off course. Generally, at
this stage, all-round stakeholder conferences or meetings are
convened to which individuals of the various constituent
bodies as well as representatives of the development partners
are invited to discuss the options proposed by the review
committee for consideration. The review committee then re-
convenes to put together the various proposals discussed and
adopted at the round-table conferences. Thereafter, the out-
comes of this exercise are submitted to the MOE in the form
of policy recommendations for considerations. Humes
(1999) contends that a relatively open process of consulta-
tion canvasses views widely and sets few limits to the issues
that are set up for debate while a relatively closed consulta-
tion restricts both those who qualify as legitimate respon-
dents and what they are invited to comment on. While this
holds true for the activities at the consultation stage of the
policy-making process in the Ghanaian context, it is impor-
tant to stress that whether an open or closed process is
adopted, it is the prerogative of government, and in most
cases, the minister in-charge of the education portfolio, to
either revise or not to revise the policy recommendations in
the light of the responses and/or feedbacks received.
Similarly, it is instructive to add that for reasons of political
expediency, the extent of revision of the policy recommenda-
tion by government at the consultation stage depends on the
degree of political will behind the policy initiative.
At the development stage, the policy-making process is
moved beyond the broad enunciation of principles to the
clarification of aims, detailed planning, pre-testing of materi-
als, or alternative plans among others. Most often, new poli-
ciesarepilot-testedbeforewholesalenationalimplementation.
A case in point is the piloting of the Junior Secondary School
(JSS) initiative (which was an offshoot of the 1987 education
reform program) in 1981 before a nationwide implementa-
tion in the 1990s. The important management implications
involved at the development stage of the policy-making pro-
cess include the remit given to individuals and groups, and
particularly the role of key institutions such as the GES
Council, the Curriculum Research Development Division
(CRDD), the National Inspectorate Board (NIB), the Ghana
National Association of Teachers (GNAT), the National
Teaching Council (NTC), and many others. In the Ghanaian
context, the development stage of the policy formulation
process also has as its integral part, the submission of policy
recommendations in the forms of bills to parliament for
approval after which the policy is then ready for
implementation.
Once the policy decision has been taken and the policy
recommendations are approved and/or passed by parliament,
the policy then moves to the implementation stage. The long-
standing practice in Ghana, backed by acts which established
the GES and the GES Council in 1974 and 1996, respec-
tively, is for pre-tertiary education policy to be implemented
by the GES for and/or on behalf of the MOE. However, a
recent complimentary practice is to set up a unit to monitor
the implementation process and carry out periodic impact
monitoring assessments. Granted that this is where the policy
is rolled out, activities at this stage call for decisions on phas-
ing, timing, the production of explanatory documents and
strategies to aid the process of implementation, as well as the
provision of in-service training programs and courses for the
"actual" implementers of the policy.
The final stage of evaluation is where the success or fail-
ure of the "new" policy is assessed, and this is normally sep-
arated in time from the other four stages. Normally, sector
analysis is conducted virtually at all the stages of policy for-
mulation but is emphasized particularly at the policy analy-
sis, pilot testing, and impact monitoring phases. Generally,
the practice in Ghana has been to choose persons who have
been involved with the policy formulation processes as
6 SAGE Open
evaluators. However, this, over the years, has been fraught
with issues relating to "insider biases" and "blinded objectiv-
ity." That is, the evaluators, more often, tend to be favorably
disposed toward finding success rather than failure of policy
formulation processes. For this reason, the practice nowa-
days is to call on independent and "objective minded" indi-
viduals and agencies to serve as evaluators of the processes
of policy formulation.
Education Policy Implementation in
Ghana: A Descriptive Account
Although represented as the fourth stage of the policy-
making process, the act of implementing education policy
constitutes a discrete process conceptualized as a hierarchi-
cal structure involving four main levels, namely, governmen-
tal, regional, district, and school levels.
Policy implementation at the governmental level in the
Ghanaian context is controlled by the MOE. The MOE has
overall responsibility for education sector policy formula-
tion, planning, monitoring, evaluation, budgeting, and co-
ordination. The MOE is headed by a minister who is
responsible for all educational issues and reports directly to
the president of the Republic. The tertiary sector manage-
ment of education falls into the hands of the Governing
Council of the tertiary institutions and is co-ordinated by the
National Council for Tertiary Education (NCTE). The pre-
tertiary-level management of education is managed by the
GES, which is the legally mandated body for implementing
all educational policies at the pre-tertiary level. The GES is
headed by a director-general who carries out his or her func-
tions of implementation and advice through the regional
directors of education, the general managers of mission/
faith-based schools, the regional managers of mission/faith-
based schools, the district directors of education, headteach-
ers and teachers of both public and private schools in the
country.
Two other bodies, namely, CRDD and NIB (formerly
Inspectorate Division), play an invaluable role in the imple-
mentation process. These are supposed to be independent
bodies created and its members appointed by government,
for the purposes of quality improvement and control in pre-
tertiary education (Quasi Autonomous Non-Governmental
Organisations [QUANGOS]), and are intended to be account-
able solely to government. Interestingly, however, the CRDD
today is still under the GES and is headed by a divisional
director accountable to the director-general of GES. The
CRDD is responsible for curriculum development, evalua-
tion, innovation, and implementation whereas the NIB is
responsible generally for supervision and inspection of
schools to ensure educational standards at the pre-tertiary
level. The functions of the NIB thus augment the endeavors
of the CRDD. Apart from the CRDD and NIB, there are
other national agencies whose activities and functions also
augment the endeavors of the GES. These agencies include
the NTC, GNAT, the West African Examinations Council
(WAEC), the National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI),
and the National Council for Vocational Education and
Training (NACVET). The job of the NTC includes the
accreditation of teacher training institutions and the accredi-
tation of individuals who pass out of teacher training col-
leges. GNAT is the official and exclusive bargaining agent
representing teachers in pre-tertiary educational institutions
in matters relating to employment working conditions.
WAEC is a regional examining body of Anglophone West
African States, which conducts all types of academic exami-
nations for students in the sub-region. The NVTI and
NACVET are involved in the development, assessment,
training, and certification of pre-tertiary technical and voca-
tional subjects.
The implementation of educational policy in each of the
10 regions in Ghana is carried out at the regional directorates
of education. Each directorate is headed by a regional direc-
tor who is accountable to the director-general of GES. The
regional director is responsible for all educational matters in
the region, and therefore liaises with the district directors and
regional managers of the various religious educational units
in the region for the implementation of all educational poli-
cies introduced and/or emanating from central government.
The regional director of education is also responsible, among
other things, for providing the necessary support and making
available funds, educational resources, and materials from
central government to all the districts under his or her
jurisdiction.
At the district level, the implementation of education pol-
icy is done by the district directorate of education which is
commonly known as the District Education Office (DEO).
The DEO is headed by the district director of education
(DDE) who takes charge of all educational matters and is
thus responsible for the implementation of education policies
and programs of GES within and throughout the district. The
DDE is accountable ultimately to director-general of GES
through the regional director of education for his or her
region. The DDE's responsibilities include, but are not lim-
ited to, the following: supervision and monitoring of schools
within the district; dissemination of education-related infor-
mation to headteachers, teachers, and educational institu-
tions (both public and private) under his or her jurisdiction;
organizing training programs for teachers and headteachers;
provision of educational resources (including furniture,
books, and infrastructural facilities); management of the cap-
itation grant scheme; resolution of conflicts between schools
and communities; organizing school/community participa-
tion programs; and setting up in schools school/community
organizations and district-level support systems such as the
parent teacher associations (PTAs), school management
committees (SMCs), district education oversight committees
(DEOCs), and district teacher support teams (DTSTs).
The activities of the DEOs are, in principle, supported and
complemented actively by the DAs. The DAs are statutory
Nudzor 7
bodies created by law for the primary purpose of decentral-
izing government business at the local or district level. They
are charged with the development of school infrastructure
and the mobilization of local communities to support and be
actively involved in the provision and delivery of pre-tertiary
education at the local levels. The DAs, thus, have statutory
duty for providing communities under their jurisdiction with
education in accordance with national policy guidelines laid
down by central government.
The "actual" implementation of educational policies for-
mulated at the national level and recommended for action is
carried out at the school level (GOG, 2001). Two very impor-
tant groups of actors, headteachers and teachers, undertake
this task. The headteachers, for example, are the chief execu-
tives or administrators of schools, and are the key imple-
menters of change that central government has at its disposal.
They are responsible for running of schools, and as such, the
success and/or failure of change initiatives in schools, to
some considerable extent, rest on their shoulders. The
responsibilities of headteachers within the resources avail-
able include, but are not restricted to, conducting affairs of
schools (through the pursuance of achievable and measur-
able objectives) to the benefit of all pupils, their parents, and
the communities they serve; implementing policies set by the
education authority under the overall direction and guidance
of DDE; the general day-to-day administration and manage-
ment of schools; and determining the job descriptions of
other members of teaching staff (GOG, 2001).
The teachers or class teachers as they are commonly
called in Ghana, however, have responsibility for the man-
agement of teaching and learning of their classes. They are
responsible for meeting the educational as well as other
related needs of the pupils they teach, which they must con-
duct in tandem with national or central government policy.
The class teachers, therefore, are seen or regarded in the
Ghanaian context as the "actual" implementers of policy,
particularly those intended to impact pupils learning out-
comes positively. Apart from their teaching roles, they are
also required to liaise with parents, guardians, and communi-
ties to reflect the local circumstances, needs, and aspirations
of the children they teach.
In summary, the above exposition describes how educa-
tional policy formulated at the national level in Ghana is
implemented and the various bodies involved in the pro-
cess. Granted, however (and as noted earlier), that educa-
tion policy in the Ghanaian context is expected to be
formulated and implemented within a decentralized system
of administration, raises some pertinent questions which
beg asking. One of these critical questions worth asking is
whether or not this top-down and rationalist approach to
education policy process imposes any restrictions, chal-
lenges, or limitations on education policy-making pro-
cesses and indeed the functioning of the educational system
in general. This and other related issues are addressed in the
following section.
Picking Strawberries From the Jam
In this section, a few of the theoretical and practical chal-
lenges and limitations imposed by the top-down and ratio-
nalist approach on the processes of education policy making
in the Ghanaian context are highlighted and elaborated on.
The rationale essentially is that this could provide some use-
ful information to facilitate and inform national education
policy dialogue to improve the Ghanaian education system.
One of the theoretical shortfalls of the rationalist approach
to education policy making and implementation adopted in
Ghana relates to its reduction of the policy process to sim-
plistic routines of decision making. The examples in this
article show that a group of authorized decision makers
assemble at particular times and places, review a problem,
consider a number of alternative courses of action with more
or less explicit calculation of the advantages and disadvan-
tages of each opinion, weigh the alternatives against their
goals or preferences, and then select an alternative that seems
well suited for achieving their purposes. As proponents of
the "policy cycle" tradition to the study of policy (Ball, 1994;
Bowe, Ball, & Gold, 1992; Olssen, Codd, & O'Neil, 2004;
Ozga, 2000; Rist, 2000; Shulock, 1999; Trowler, 1998)
would have us believe, the processes of policy making go
beyond this simplistic traditional approach to decision
making. For them, policy is a complex process involving
contestations, struggles, negotiations, and dialogues between
the different actors of policy within and outside the policy-
making machinery. According to the adherents of the process
conception of policy, the contested and negotiated nature of
the policy process, for example, is evident at both the policy
"encoding" and "decoding" phases, which are also referred
to in policy terms as policy as both text and discourse. The
encoding phase of policy formulation denotes the initial
stage of formal policy making where the ideas, values, and
aspirations of both the key actors involved in the policy pro-
cess and the people and/or interests they represent are elic-
ited and enlisted via struggles, compromises, authoritative
public interpretations, and reinterpretations. The decoding
phase, however, is marked by the disputed and complex
ways by which the policy messages and outcomes are inter-
preted by actors and implementers in the contexts of their
own culture, ideology, history, resources, and expertise. For
this reason therefore, conceptualizing education policy pro-
cesses in quite straightforward terms into phases, as the
Ghanaian case shows, tends to ignore the wider structural,
socio-cultural, and political dimensions of policy by over-
simplifying or reducing the processes to operational plans
and routines which need following to achieve desired out-
comes of change (Ranson, 1995; Trowler, 1998; Trowler &
Knight, 2002).
Following on from the above, the top-down, and rational-
ist approach to policy adopted within the perceived decen-
tralized system in Ghana could also be criticized theoretically
for reinforcing implicitly the prevailing traditional view of
8 SAGE Open
policy as a problem-solving tool. As per the expositions in
this article (particularly the conception and consultation
stages of the policy-making process), the rationalist approach
to policy adopted in Ghana appears to reiterate the assump-
tion that experts trained in proper analytical techniques can
apply their expertise to the political marketplace, discover
and measure the impact of policy on citizen interests, project
policy consequences with some accuracy, and affect the deci-
sions of identifiable clients, who will use policy and its anal-
yses to solve problems. Trowler and Knight (2002) capture
this erroneous impression forcefully when they write that
[T]he technical-rational approach to policymaking invigorated
in/by the change management perspective assumes that if
sufficient energy can be elicited from those involved by
enthusiastic leaders with clear vision of change then large scale
transformations can be accomplished relatively quickly and
economically. (p. 144)
Theoretically, and in policy terms, not only is this assump-
tion overly deterministic but represents a change manage-
ment perspective driven by the "stages" view in which the
final stage of policy making is a timely recommendation to a
client or a timely intervention to solve pressing problems.
This, consequently places huge limitations on our under-
standing of policy processes. This is particularly because the
"client orientation" invigorated implicitly in this rationalist
approach endorses the prevailing view of policy making as
relatively orderly in which analysis and implementation are
seen as advice to clients, and their usefulness is assessed as
its contribution to eventual decisions or actions by policy
makers and/or reformers, rather than as contributions to
broader cultural, socio-economic, and political discourses
(Shulock, 1999).
In practical terms, the hierarchical approach to policy
making adopted in the Ghanaian education system has, in
many instances, led to the allied agencies responsible for
playing key roles in education sector policy decisions operat-
ing in parallel to national and sub-national institutions and
structures of decentralization. A case in point worth citing to
illustrate this issue concerns the activities of GES. As per the
rules that established it as the sole agency for implementing
pre-tertiary education policy in 1974, the GES was/is man-
dated to, among other things, liaise and/or engage with other
national and sub-national institutions of decentralization in
providing and delivering education at/to the local levels.
Dishearteningly however, the hierarchical nature of the edu-
cation system and its inherent concentration of power at the
center appear not to have enabled the GES to be able to per-
form this onerous role effectively. Consequently, to be able
to perform its mandated role, the GES has had, in many
instances, to arrogate to itself decision-making powers con-
trary to its subordinate position within the MOE. The effect
of this is that, sometimes, some top management staff and
field officials of GES made pronouncements bordering on
policy without the prior knowledge of the MOE and the min-
ister of education. This particular issue led to the abolishing
of the GES Council in 1983 under PNDC Law 42, and its
functions and powers were vested in the PNDC Secretary for
Education (Working Group on Education Sector Analysis,
2000). However, since the re-establishment of the GES
Council in 1996, the situation has improved considerably
and there is now a greater institutional participation of GES
in education policy-making processes.
Conversely, the top-down and rationalist approach to
policy formulation and implementation discussed in this
article has more often resulted in what is perceived as the
duplication of function among the various agencies respon-
sible for policy implementation at the grassroots level in
Ghana. A good illustration here relates to the tensions and
unnecessary conflicts between some District Education
Directorates and DAs. As per the policy implementation
structure presented earlier in this article, policy implementa-
tion at the district or local levels falls directly under the
ambit of DEOs. The DEOs are headed by the DDOs who are
responsible, among other things, for the supervision and
monitoring of schools within the district, training of person-
nel of the education service, provision of educational
resources (including furniture, books, and infrastructural
facilities), management of the capitation grant scheme, and
setting up in schools school/community organizations and
district-level support systems. Ironically, however, (and
owing largely to the adoption of the decentralization initia-
tive), DAs have also been mandated by law as both direct
representatives of government and agencies of development
to engage in some aspects of education provision and deliv-
ery mainly through the development of school infrastruc-
ture. Clearly, what some people see as a duplication and/or
contradiction in the functions of both the DEO and DAs
have been noted, and measures such as making DDEs auto-
matic members of District Education Select Committees
have been put in place to cure any mischief that may arise.
However, the sad news in Ghana is that owing to reasons of
political expediency and/or perhaps lack of education, fre-
quent tensions and conflicts rear their ugly heads between
DEOs and DAs regarding their core mandates, thus throw-
ing the entire education provision and delivery agenda vis-
à-vis the concept of decentralization off gear.
Democratizing Policy Processes:
Proposals for Change
Having unearthed the effects of the hierarchical approach to
policy making and implementation on the education system
in Ghana in the previous section, this part of the article
moves now into a brief discussion of proposals for change in
terms of how education policy processes could be democra-
tized and decentralized to benefit the Ghanaian education
system.
Nudzor 9
The first proposal, as far as this article is concerned,
relates to the urgent need and action to be taken to "de-
politicalized" education policy initiation, or to discourage
what for the purposes of this article is referred to as the impo-
sition of policy from the "center." In this context, "de-politi-
calization of policy" is not a suggestion that the processes of
policy making and implementation should necessarily be
devoid of politics. Rather, what this is intended to de-empha-
size is the petty partisan politics currently being practiced in
Ghana to the extent that political parties (ruling governments
most especially) are able to hijack educational policies and
practices for purposes of political expediency. A good exam-
ple in support of this suggestion concerns the provision of
pre-tertiary education in Ghana and matters arising from its
structure and duration. Until the third quarter of the 1980s,
Ghana operated a 17-year (6 years primary, 4 years middle, 5
years secondary, and 2 years sixth form) pre-tertiary educa-
tion system. However, in 1987, President Jerry John
Rawlings's military regime introduced a new system of edu-
cation mooted earlier in 1974. This new system reduced the
length of pre-tertiary education from 17 to 12 years (i.e., 6
years primary, 3 years junior secondary, and 3 years senior
secondary education) owing to the perceived weakness that
the 17 years had a telling effect on national budget because it
was too long (MOE, 1987). Upon assumption of government
in 2000, President JohnAgyekum Kufour's National Patriotic
Party (NPP), under the pretext that too many subjects were
taught and were poorly handled in Ghanaian basic schools,
also changed the name, structure, and duration of pre-tertiary
education to 15 years. This new system comprised 2 years
pre-school, 6 years primary, 3 years junior high school (JHS),
and 4 years senior high school (SHS; MOE, 2005). As if
these changes were not enough, the late President John Atta
Mills­led NDC government, which took over the mantle of
governance from the NPP in 2008, subtracted 1 year from the
SHS component of the existing structure under the pretext of
lack of infrastructural facilities, equipment, and logistics.
Thus, the duration of the existing pre-tertiary education
structure in Ghana was reduced from 15 to 14 years. While it
needs to be acknowledged that change in policy direction is
one of the ways by which successive governments get to
operationalize their ideological beliefs, programs, and poli-
cies, the point being made here forcefully is to ensure that
educational processes and policies are not opened up to the
whims and caprices of unscrupulous and self-seeking politi-
cal parties and leaders who, for purposes of gaining political
currency, may cause long-term and lasting injuries to the
educational system. One strategy to achieve what I call "a
de-politicalized education policy making" is to ensure that
there is in place a national development policy, plan, or
framework from which educational policies of the country
would emanate and whose goals educational policies are
geared toward achieving. Quite apart from providing a
national policy framework against which all successive gov-
ernment would lean, this will also ensure consistency and
alacrity in the provision of good quality education to all
Ghanaian citizens.
Following up closely on the first proposal is the advice for
government and its allied agencies of education to embark
upon devolution of power to formulate and implement edu-
cation policy to local or district levels. Undoubtedly, some
arrangement to this effect could be said to be in place already
in Ghana under the policy of decentralization. However, the
point of emphasis here is that this does not appear to be tak-
ing hold in practice because of the problems associated with
the policy-making regime in place currently. Therefore, what
this article is calling for is not necessarily re-inventing the
wheel of decentralization, but a more concerted and sus-
tained efforts aimed at rejuvenating the processes and struc-
tures of decentralization. One of the practical ways of
achieving this objective is by adopting the local education
authority (LEA) system or strategy practiced in countries
such as the United Kingdom. The LEA strategy of decentral-
ization ensures that local actors of policy are empowered and
positioned to take strategic decisions regarding the planning,
administration, management, and leadership of schools in
their local jurisdictions.
An equally important way of democratizing and decen-
tralizing education policy processes in Ghana is through the
encouragement and support of bottom-up approaches to pol-
icy making. As has been indicated already in this article,
some structures or agencies of decentralization (such as DAs,
DEOs, DEOCs, DTSTs, PTAs, SMCs) are already opera-
tional in the Ghanaian educational setup. For example, under
the current policy of decentralizing educational administra-
tion, the Education Management Information System (EMIS)
is being positioned as a resource to construct operational
plans and develop budgets at the district levels to ensure that
education provision becomes more efficient and responsive
to local needs. Essentially, under this process, the MOE is
still required to retain overall responsibility for teacher train-
ing, curriculum development, and monitoring policy at the
national level. However, the districts, unlike before, are to
take responsibility for their own policies, operational plans,
and budgets based on accurate and up-to-date information
obtained from EMIS as opposed to their needs being deter-
mined by the MOE and GES.As a step toward democratizing
and decentralizing education policy formulation and imple-
mentation, this article advocates for the actualization of
arrangements such as this one. This, in the view of the article,
will empower and enable local-level actors of policy to gen-
erate policy at their levels which will then feed into the
national development agenda and hence bring about the
needed changes and improvements in the education system
and in the lives of the Ghanaian citizenry.
Summary and Conclusion
This article is built on the premise that traditional hierarchi-
cal approaches to policy processes do not support and/or
10 SAGE Open
encourage devolution of power from the center to local-level
actors of policy. Using the Ghanaian education context as an
exemplar, the article analyzes critically the practice of educa-
tion policy making and implementation within the context of
decentralized system of administration. This is done to
unearth the challenges and limitations that the adoption of
the rationalist approach to policy places on policy processes
and indeed, the functioning of the educational system.
Essentially, the article finds that some reasonable amount
of decentralization efforts was and is still being made, and
some education decentralization structures (e.g., DAs,
DEOs, DEOCs, DSTSs, PTAs, and SMCs) are also in place
to devolve power to local levels to ensure that decision mak-
ing in education becomes more efficient and responsive to
local needs. However, the article argues, although implicitly,
that Ghana's interest and focus on strengthening central gov-
ernment control at the local levels (rather than on devolution)
have had a "knock-on" effect on policy processes to the
extent that education policy making and implementation is
seen to have assumed the traditional and managerial "top-
down" posture. This consequently, and as the article con-
tends, has caused the educational decentralization structures
and institutions and their local governance counterparts to
operate as dual hierarchical and parallel structures.
Within the context of unearthing the theoretical and prac-
tical effects this rationalist approach to policy has on the
Ghanaian educational system, the article makes three key
proposals for change in terms of how education system could
be democratized and decentralized to benefit the Ghanaian
citizenry. The proposals puts forth include de-politicalizing
education policy making, devolving and deconcentrating
power to formulate and implement education policy from
central government to local or district levels, and support for
bottom-up approaches to policy making.
So, while this article concerns itself mainly with educa-
tion policy processes in the Ghanaian context, the discus-
sions reverberate strongly the criticism against centralized
systems of education administration and policy making in
the sense that these systems do not support decentralization.
Rather, they tend to adhere to the straitjacket of external
accountability models which favors imposition of change
from the "center."
