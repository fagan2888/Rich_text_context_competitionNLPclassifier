Abstract
Public health authorities have described, with growing alarm, an unprece-
dented increase in morbidity and mortality associated with use of opioid pain
relievers (OPRs). Efforts to address the opioid crisis have focused mainly on
reducing nonmedical OPR use. Too often overlooked, however, is the need
for preventing and treating opioid addiction, which occurs in both medical
and nonmedical OPR users. Overprescribing of OPRs has led to a sharp
increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction, which in turn has been asso-
ciated with a rise in overdose deaths and heroin use. A multifaceted public
health approach that utilizes primary, secondary, and tertiary opioid addic-
tion prevention strategies is required to effectively reduce opioid-related
morbidity and mortality. We describe the scope of this public health crisis,
its historical context, contributing factors, and lines of evidence indicating
the role of addiction in exacerbating morbidity and mortality, and we provide
a framework for interventions to address the epidemic of opioid addiction.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past 15 years, the rate of opioid pain relievers (OPR) use in the United States has
soared. From 1999 to 2011, consumption of hydrocodone more than doubled and consumption
of oxycodone increased by nearly 500% (42). During the same time frame, the OPR-related
overdose death rate nearly quadrupled (15). According to the United States Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the unprecedented increase in OPR consumption has led to the
"worst drug overdose epidemic in [US] history" (58). Given the magnitude of the problem, the
CDC recently added opioid overdose prevention to its list of top five public health challenges (13).
Overdose mortality is not the only adverse public health outcome associated with increased
OPR use. The rise in opioid consumption has also been associated with a near doubling in visits
to emergency rooms for nonmedical OPR use from 2004 to 2011 (69) and in neonatal abstinence
syndrome from 2000 to 2009 (57). Moreover, from 1997 to 2011, there was a 900% increase in
individuals seeking treatment for addiction to OPRs (66, 68). The correlation between opioid sales,
OPR-related overdose deaths, and treatment seeking for opioid addiction is striking (Figure 1).
Addiction is defined as continued use of a drug despite negative consequences (1). Opioids are
highly addictive because they induce euphoria (positive reinforcement) and cessation of chronic
use produces dysphoria (negative reinforcement). Chronic exposure to opioids results in structural
and functional changes in regions of the brain that mediate affect, impulse, reward, and motivation
(83, 91). The disease of opioid addiction arises from repeated exposure to opioids and can occur
in individuals using opioids to relieve pain and in nonmedical users.
Another important feature of the opioid addiction epidemic is the relationship between OPR
use and heroin use. According to the federal government's National Survey on Drug Use and
Health (NSDUH), 4 out of 5 current heroin users report that their opioid use began with OPRs
(54). Many of these individuals appear to be switching to heroin after becoming addicted to
OPRs because heroin is less expensive on the black market. For example, in a recent sample of

opioid-addicted individuals who switched from OPRs to heroin, 94% reported doing so because
OPRs "were far more expensive and harder to obtain" (16, p. 24).
The increased prevalence of opioid addiction has also been associated with increases in heroin-
related morbidity and mortality. For example, since 2001, heroin addiction treatment admissions
for whites ages 20­34 have increased sharply (Figure 2). During this time frame, heroin overdose
deaths among whites ages 18­44 increased by 171% (14).
HISTORY OF OPIOID ADDICTION IN THE UNITED STATES
The current opioid addiction crisis is, in many ways, a replay of history. America's first epidemic of
opioid addiction occurred in the second half of the nineteenth century. In the 1840s, the estimated
national supply of opium and morphine could have supported a maximum of 0.72 opioid-addicted
individuals per 1,000 persons (18). Over the next 50 years, opioid consumption soared by 538%.
It reached its peak in the mid-1890s, when the supply could have supported a maximum of 4.59
opioid-addicted individuals per 1,000 persons. The ceiling rate then began to decline, and by 1920
there were no more than 1.97 opioid-addicted individuals per 1,000 persons in the United States.
The epidemic had diverse origins. Mothers dosed themselves and their children with opium
tinctures and patent medicines. Soldiers used opium and morphine to treat diarrhea and painful
injuries. Drinkers alleviated hangovers with opioids. Chinese immigrants smoked opium, a practice
that spread to the white underworld. But the main source of the epidemic was iatrogenic morphine
addiction, which coincided with the spread of hypodermic medication during 1870­1895. The
modal opioid-addicted individual was a native-born white woman with a painful disorder, often
of a chronic nature.
Nineteenth-century physicians addicted patients--and, not infrequently, themselves--because
they had few alternatives to symptomatic treatment. Cures were scarce and the etiology of painful
conditions was poorlyunderstood.An injection of morphine almost magically alleviated symptoms,
pleasing doctors and patients. Many patients continued to acquire and inject morphine, the sale
of which was poorly controlled.
The revolutions in bacteriology and public health, which reduced diarrheal and other diseases
commonly treated with opium; the development of alternative analgesics such as aspirin; stricter

prescription laws; and admonitions about morphine in the lay and professional literature stemmed
the addiction tide. One important lesson of the first narcotic epidemic is that physicians were
educable. Indeed, by 1919, narcotic overprescribing was the hallmark of older, less-competent
physicians. The younger, better-trained practitioners who replaced them were more circumspect
about administering and prescribing opioids (5).
For the rest of the twentieth century, opioid addiction epidemics resulted from transient in-
creases in the incidence of nonmedical heroin use in urban areas. After World War II, these
epidemics disproportionately affected inner-city minority populations, such as the large, heavily
publicized increase in ghetto heroin use and addiction at the end of the 1960s (24, 37).
THE SHARP RISE IN PRESCRIPTION OPIOID CONSUMPTION
In 1986 a paper describing the treatment of 38 chronic pain patients concluded that OPRs could
be prescribed safely on a long-term basis (61). Despite its low-quality evidence, the paper was
widely cited to support expanded use of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Opioid use increased
gradually in the 1980s. In 1996, the rate of opioid use began accelerating rapidly (38). This
acceleration was fueled in large part by the introduction in 1995 of OxyContin, an extended
release formulation of oxycodone manufactured by Purdue Pharma.
Between 1996 and 2002, Purdue Pharma funded more than 20,000 pain-related educational
programs through direct sponsorship or financial grants and launched a multifaceted campaign
to encourage long-term use of OPRs for chronic non-cancer pain (86). As part of this campaign,
Purdue provided financial support to the American Pain Society, the American Academy of Pain
Medicine, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the Joint Commission, pain patient groups,
and other organizations (27). In turn, these groups all advocated for more aggressive identification
and treatment of pain, especially use of OPRs.
For example, in 1995, the president of the American Pain Society introduced a campaign en-
titled "Pain is the Fifth Vital Sign" at the society's annual meeting. This campaign encouraged
health care professionals to assess pain with the "same zeal" as they do with vital signs and urged
more aggressive use of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (9). Shortly thereafter, the Veterans'
Affairs health system, as well as the Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals and other health
care organizations, embraced the Pain is the Fifth Vital Sign campaign to increase the identi-
fication and treatment of pain, especially with OPRs. Similarly, the American Pain Society and
the American Academy of Pain Medicine issued a consensus statement endorsing opioid use for
chronic non-cancer pain (31). Although the statement cautioned against imprudent prescribing,
this warning may have been overshadowed by assertions that the risk of addiction and tolerance
was low, risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression was short-lived, and concerns about drug
diversion and abuse should not constrain prescribing.
Prior to the introduction of OxyContin, many physicians were reluctant to prescribe OPRs
on a long-term basis for common chronic conditions because of their concerns about addiction,
tolerance, and physiological dependence (80). To overcome what they claimed to be "opiopho-
bia," physician-spokespersons for opioid manufacturers published papers and gave lectures in
which they claimed that the medical community had been confusing addiction with "physical
dependence." They described addiction as rare and completely distinct from so-called "physical
dependence," which was said to be "clinically unimportant" (60, p. 300). They cited studies with
serious methodological flaws to highlight the claim that the risk of addiction was less than 1% (28,
45, 52, 59, 62).
In addition to minimizing risks of OPRs, the campaign advanced by opioid manufacturers
and pain organizations exaggerated the benefits of long-term OPR use. In fact, high-quality,

PU36CH25-Kolodny ARI 29 December 2014 13:38
long-term clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of OPRs for chronic non-cancer
pain had never been conducted. Surveys of patients with chronic non-cancer pain receiving
long-term OPRs suggest that most patients continued to experience significant chronic pain and
dysfunction (25, 76). The CDC and some professional societies now warn clinicians to avoid
prescribing OPRs for common chronic conditions (29).
Although increased opioid consumption over the past two decades has been driven largely
by greater ambulatory use for chronic non-cancer pain (8), opioid use for acute pain among
hospitalized patients has also increased sharply. A recent study found that physicians prescribed
opioids in more than 50% of 1.14 million nonsurgical hospital admissions from 2009 to 2010,
often in high doses (34). The Joint Commission's adoption of the Pain is the Fifth Vital Sign
campaign and federally mandated patient satisfaction surveys asking patients to rate how often
hospital staff did "everything they could to help you with your pain" are noteworthy, given the
association with increased hospital use of OPRs.
REFRAMING THE OPIOID CRISIS AS AN EPIDEMIC OF ADDICTION
Policy makers and the media often characterize the opioid crisis as a problem of nonmedical OPR
abuse by adolescents and young adults. However, several lines of evidence suggest that addiction
occurring in both medical and nonmedical users, rather than abuse per se, is the key driver of
opioid-related morbidity and mortality in medical and nonmedical OPR users.
Opioid Harms Are Not Limited to Nonmedical Users
Over the past decade, federal and state policy makers have attempted to reduce OPR abuse and
OPR-related overdose deaths. Despite these efforts, morbidity and mortality associated with OPRs
have continued to worsen in almost every US state (10). Thus far, these efforts have focused
primarily on preserving access to OPRs for chronic pain patients while reducing nonmedical
OPR use (89), defined as the use of a medication without a prescription, in a way other than as
prescribed, or for the experience or feeling it causes. However, policy makers who focus solely on
reducing nonmedical use are failing to appreciate the high opioid-related morbidity and mortality
in pain patients receiving OPR prescriptions for medical purposes.
The incidence of nonmedical OPR use increased sharply in the late 1990s, peaking in 2002
with 2.7 million new nonmedical users. Since 2002, the incidence of nonmedical use has gradually
declined to 1.8 million in 2012 (64, 70) (Figure 3). Although the number of new nonmedical
users has declined, overdose deaths, addiction treatment admissions, and other adverse public
health outcomes associated with OPR use have increased dramatically since 2002.
A comparison of age groups of nonmedical OPR users to age groups suffering the highest rates
of opioid-related morbidity and mortality suggests that strategies focused exclusively on reducing
nonmedical OPR use are insufficient (Figure 4). Although past-month nonmedical use of OPRs
is most common in teenagers and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24 (65), OPR overdose
deaths occur most often in adults ages 45­54, and the age group that has experienced the greatest
increase in overdose mortality over the past decade is 55­64 (15), an age group in which medical
use of OPRs is common. Opioid overdoses appear to occur more frequently in medical OPR users
than in young nonmedical users. For example, in a study of 254 unintentional opioid overdose
decedents in Utah, 92% of the decedents had been receiving legitimate OPR prescriptions from
health care providers for chronic pain (39).
Middle-aged women and the elderly are more likely than other groups to visit doctors with
complaints of pain (4). The development of iatrogenic opioid addiction in these groups may
explain why they have experienced the largest increase in hospital stays resulting from opioid user

experienced the largest increase in accidental opioid overdose deaths (12, 15).

opioid-addicted, consistent findings in samples of OPR overdose decedents show that deaths are
most common in individuals likely to be suffering from opioid addiction. A study of 295 unin-
tentional OPR overdose deaths in West Virginia found that four out of five decedents (80%) had
a history of a substance use disorder (33). Another study found that among 254 opioid overdose
decedents in Utah, about three-fourths (76%) had relatives or friends who were concerned about
the decedent's misuse of opioids prescribed for pain (39).
The sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction is a key driver of opioid-related
morbidity and mortality. The misattribution of the opioid crisis to nonmedical use or abuse rather
than to addiction has stymied efforts to address this crisis because it suggests a different set of
policies. When the opioid crisis is reframed from an "epidemic of opioid abuse" to an "epidemic
of opioid addiction," the strategies required to control the epidemic become clearer.
PREVENTION STRATEGIES
This section organizes strategies for curbing the epidemic of opioid addiction into primary, sec-
ondary, and tertiary prevention. Although some specific interventions are discussed, we do not
provide an exhaustive list. Rather, our purpose is to demonstrate that prevention strategies em-
ployed in epidemiologic responses to communicable and noncommunicable disease epidemics
apply equally well when the disease in question is opioid addiction. Interventions should focus on
preventing new cases of opioid addiction (primary prevention), identifying early cases of opioid
addiction (secondary prevention), and ensuring access to effective addiction treatment (tertiary
prevention).
Primary Prevention
The aim of primaryprevention is to reducethe incidence of a disease or condition. Opioid addiction
is typically chronic, life-long, difficult to treat, and associated with high rates of morbidity and
mortality. Thus, bringing the opioid addiction epidemic under control requires effort to prevent
new cases from developing.

Preventing addiction caused by medical exposure to OPRs. The incidence of iatrogenic
opioid addiction in patients treated with long-term OPRs is unknown because adequately designed
prospective studies have not been conducted. However, opioid use disorders appear to be highly
prevalent in chronic pain patients treated with OPRs. A survey performed by Boscarino et al.
of 705 chronic pain patients treated in specialty and primary care outpatient centers found that
26% met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV criteria for opioid
dependence, and 35% met DSM V criteria for an opioid use disorder (6, 7). A systematic review
of studies utilizing opioids for low back pain found that aberrant drug abuse­related behaviors
suggestive of addiction occurred in up to 24% of patients on long-term OPRs (50). Many patients
on long-term OPRs worry about dependence and addiction and express a desire to taper or cease
opioid therapy (76).
To reduce the incidence of iatrogenic opioid addiction, health care professionals must prescribe
opioidsmorecautiouslyfor both acuteand chronicpain.Unfortunately,thecampaign to encourage
OPR prescribing has left many health care providers with a poor appreciation of opioid risks,
especially the risk of addiction, and an overestimation of opioid benefits. Despite these risks and
the lack of evidence supporting long-term efficacy, OPR prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain
increased over the past decade while use of nonopioid analgesics decreased (20). This pattern
highlights the need for prescriber education that explicitly corrects misperceptions about OPR
safety and efficacy. If clinicians treating pain more often substituted nonopioid analgesics and
nonpharmaceutical approaches for OPRs, evidence suggests the incidence of opioid addiction
would decline and outcomes for patients with chronic non-cancer pain would improve.
Many prescribers are unaware that evidence of long-term effectiveness for OPRs is lacking
and that risks, in addition to addiction, include respiratory depression leading to unintentional
overdose death; serious fractures from falls (71, 77); hypogonadism and other endocrine effects that
can cause a spectrum of adverse effects (88); increased pain sensitivity (2); chronic constipation
and serious fecal impaction (81); and chronic dry mouth, which can lead to tooth decay (79).
Providing prescribers with accurate information about opioid risks and benefits could result in
more informed risk/benefit appraisals. Indeed, one of the lessons learned from the nineteenth-
century opioid addiction epidemic was that physicians were educable. By the early 1900s, aggressive
opioid prescribing had become the hallmark of older, less-competent physicians (5).
Several states, including Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Ohio, Tennessee, and Utah, have
passed mandatory prescriber education legislation (89). In addition, the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) is requiring manufacturers of extended release and long-acting OPRs to sponsor
educational programs for prescribers. Unfortunately, some of these educational programs, includ-
ing those required by the FDA, imply that OPRs are safe and effective for chronic non-cancer
pain instead of offering prescribers accurate information about OPR risks and benefits (84). It
remains unclear whether or not educational programs such as these will reduce OPR prescribing
for common conditions where risks of use are likely to outweigh benefits.
Some opioid manufacturers have reformulated OPRs to make them more difficult to misuse
through an intranasal or injection route. These so-called abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs)
may offer safety advantages over easily snorted and injected OPRs, but they do not render them
less addictive. Opioid addiction, in both medical and nonmedical OPR users, most frequently
develops through oral use (85). Some opioid-addicted individuals may transition to intranasal or
injection use, but most continue to use OPRs orally (47). Thus, ADFs should not be considered
a primary prevention strategy for opioid addiction.
In 2013, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released emergency
room guidelines on OPR prescribing (55). Recommendations included in the guidelines call for
substituting nonopioid analgesics when possible, avoiding use of extended-release OPRs, and
25.8 Kolodny et al.

limiting the supply to three days. Reducing patient exposure to OPRs and reducing the supply of
excess OPRs in the homes of discharged patients may be effective strategies for preventing opioid
addiction that can occur from both medical and nonmedical OPR use.
Preventing addiction caused by nonmedical exposure to OPRs. Individuals who use OPRs
nonmedically are at risk for developing opioid addiction. Thus, efforts to reduce nonmedical use
are an important primary prevention strategy. Adolescents and young adults who experiment with
nonmedical use are most likely to obtain OPRs for free from friends or family members who had
received a legitimate prescription (70). This information suggests that more cautious prescribing
is required to prevent nonmedical use of excess OPRs. Unused OPRs in medicine chests should
be immediately discarded or returned to a pharmacy, which became permissible in October 2014
after the Drug Enforcement Administration made a federal regulatory change (82).
Although OPRs have an abuse liability similar to that of heroin (17), they are commonly per-
ceived as less risky. Seventy-three percent of eighth graders surveyed in 2013 perceived occasional
use of heroin without a needle as high risk, but only 26% perceived occasional use of Vicodin as
high risk (41). Eighth graders also perceived occasional Vicodin use as less risky than occasional
marijuana use, less risky than smoking 1­5 cigarettes per day, and less risky than moderate alcohol
use.
Individuals who perceive the risk of nonmedical OPR use to be low may be more likely to
misuse OPRs. A 2004 survey found that college students who perceive a low level of risk from
OPRs were 9.6 times more likely to use OPRs nonmedically, as compared with those who perceive
these medications as harmful (3). Although the ability for causal inference from this type of cross-
sectional survey is limited, this finding suggests that social marketing campaigns designed to
increase perceived harmfulness of OPRs may be an effective prevention strategy.
Secondary Prevention
The aim of secondary prevention is to screen for a health condition after its onset but before it
causes serious complications. Efforts to identify and treat opioid-addicted individuals early in the
course of the disease are likely to reduce the risk of overdose, psychosocial deterioration, transition
to injection opioid use, and medical complications.
Physicians are frequently the source of OPRs for opioid-addicted medical and nonmedical
users (43). Contacts with medical professionals present valuable opportunities for early identi-
fication of opioid addiction. However, detection of opioid addiction in OPR users can be very
difficult. Opioid-addicted chronic pain patients may demonstrate aberrant drug-related behaviors,
such as presenting for early refills. However, some opioid-addicted pain patients, especially those
prescribed high doses, may not demonstrate drug-seeking behavior. Opioid-addicted individuals
receiving OPR prescriptions are often reluctant to disclose their concerns about addiction with
prescribers because they fear being judged, being cut off from a legitimate supply, or being labeled
as malingerers for feigning pain.
The difficulty of diagnosing opioid addiction in individuals motivated to conceal their condi-
tion suggests that prescribers should seek collateral information before prescribing OPRs. Urine
toxicology can be used to verify a patient's self-reported drug ingestion history (53). However,
urine toxicology of patients on long-term OPRs is not a reliable strategy for identifying opioid
addiction. Urine toxicology cannot determine if a patient is taking extra doses or if a patient is
using OPRs by an intranasal or injection route.
Opioid-addicted individuals may receive OPR prescriptions from multiple providers, a prac-
tice referred to as "doctor shopping." Doctor shoppers can be identified through use of state
www.annualreviews.org · The Opioid Addiction Epidemic 25.9
Changes may still occur before final publication online and in print
PU36CH25-Kolodny ARI 29 December 2014 13:38
prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs). Some state PDMPs send unsolicited reports
to the medical providers of doctor shoppers. Research suggests that unsolicited reports increase
prescribers' ability to detect opioid addiction, sometimes prompting actions such as coordinating
care with other providers and modifying their own prescribing practices, as well as screening and
referring for addiction treatment (78).
Prescribers in most states can consult their state PDMP before prescribing OPRs. PDMPs may
be especially useful in emergency rooms and other settings where opioid-addicted individuals feign
pain to obtain OPRs. Too often, however, patients identified as doctor shoppers are simply turned
away, without hospital staff attempting to link these patients to addiction treatment services. Efforts
must be made to help these clinicians understand that drug-seeking patients are suffering from
the chronic, life-threatening disease of opioid addiction.
One challenge to PDMP effectiveness has been the low rate of provider use of these data
(48). To increase prescriber utilization, Kentucky, Tennessee, and New York passed legislation
mandating that prescribers check the PDMP before prescribing controlled substances. Data from
these states indicate that PDMP utilization increased rapidly subsequent to the mandate, which
correlated with declines in opioid prescribing (KY, TN, NY) and a sharp drop in visits to multiple
providers (TN, NY) (35).
Tertiary Prevention
Tertiary prevention strategies involve both therapeutic and rehabilitative measures once a disease
is firmly established. The goal of tertiary prevention of opioid addiction is to prevent overdose
deaths, medical complications, psychosocial deterioration, transition to injection drug use, and
injection-related infectious diseases. Doing so is accomplished mainly by ensuring that opioid-
addicted individuals can access effective and affordable opioid addiction treatment.
Opioid addiction treatment. The need for opioid addiction treatment is great and largely unmet.
According to the NSDUH, an estimated 2.1 million Americans are addicted to OPRs, and 467,000
are addicted to heroin (70). Unfortunately, these estimates exclude many opioid-addicted pain
patients because NSDUH participants are told by surveyors that "we are only interested in your
use of prescription pain relievers that were not prescribed for you or that you used only for the
experience or feeling they caused" (67, p. 124).
In 2005, there were an estimated 10 million chronic pain patients receiving daily, long-term
treatment with OPRs (8). The continuing increase in opioid consumption from 2005 to 2011
(42) suggests that the number may now exceed 10 million. Applying the prevalence estimates of
DSM V opioid dependence found by Boscarino et al. (6) in pain patients taking long-term opioids
would indicate that an additional 2.5 million chronic pain patients may be opioid-addicted. Thus,
the total number of Americans suffering from opioid addiction may exceed 5 million.
Treatment of opioid addiction includes pharmacotherapies and psychosocial approaches, in-
cluding residential treatment, mutual-help programs (e.g., Narcotics Anonymous), and 12-Step
treatment programs. These modalities may be used as stand-alone interventions or in combination
with pharmacotherapy. Psychosocial opioid addiction treatment approaches show value and are
an important treatment option (63). However, research with greater specificity and consistency is
needed to better evaluate outcomes.
Pharmacotherapies for opioid addiction include agonist maintenance with methadone and
partial-agonist maintenance with buprenorphine and antagonist treatment with naltrexone, which
is available in a monthly injection. Methadone and buprenorphine work by controlling cravings.
Naltrexone works by preventing opioid-addicted individuals from feeling the effects of opioids.

Naltrexone may be helpful in highly motivated and carefully selected patients. However, patients
treated with naltrexone may be at increased risk of overdose death should relapse occur (23).
Multiple well-designed randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence that buprenor-
phine maintenance and methadone maintenance are safe and effective treatments for opioid ad-
diction (30, 40, 46, 49, 74, 75). Both buprenorphine and methadone treatment are associated
with reduced overdose risk and improved maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancy (19, 44, 51,
72). Despite strong evidence supporting the use of buprenorphine and methadone, fewer than
1 million Americans are receiving these treatments (87).
Methadone poses a substantially greater risk of respiratory depression than does buprenorphine
and can be obtained only from licensed opioid treatment programs (OTPs). The lack of OTPs
in many communities presents a major challenge to expanding access to methadone. In contrast,
buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, has a better safety profile than does methadone and can be
prescribed in an office-based setting (26). Barriers to accessing buprenorphine include federal lim-
its on the number of patients a physician may treat, ineligibility of nurse practitioners to prescribe
it, and inadequate integration of buprenorphine into primary care treatment. Access to buprenor-
phine treatment could be expanded if the federal government eased or remove regulatory barriers.
Harm-reduction approaches. Tertiary prevention strategies also include harm-reduction ap-
proaches to improving health outcomes and reducing overdose deaths. In the subset of opioid-
addicted individuals who are heroin injection drug users, evidence suggests that access to syringe
exchange programs can prevent HIV infection (22). These efforts have been less effective at pre-
venting hepatitis C infection, which is increasing rapidly in young, white IDUs (32).
Expanding access to naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote, can prevent overdose deaths by
reversing life-threatening respiratory depression. In the 1990s, syringe exchange programs began
distributing naloxone to injection drug users for the purpose of rescuing peers. Evidence shows that
clients of syringe exchange programs demonstrated the ability to successfully reverse overdoses
when they had been provided with naloxone and training (73). In addition, providing family
members of opioid-addicted individuals and nonparamedic first responders with naloxone may be
an effective strategy for rescuing overdose victims (21, 90). At present, there are more than 188
community-based naloxone distribution programs in 15 states and the District of Columbia (11).
CONCLUSION
The increased prevalence of opioid addiction, caused by overprescribing of OPRs, has led to a
parallel increase in opioid overdose deaths. Efforts to address this crisis that focus exclusively
on reducing nonmedical OPR use have been ineffective. Middle-aged and elderly individuals
commonly exposed to OPRs for pain treatment have experienced the largest increase in rates of
opioid-related morbidity and mortality. Recognition that opioid addiction in both medical and
nonmedical users is a key driver of opioid-related morbidity and mortality will result in a more
effective response to this public health crisis. Just as public health authorities would approach
other disease outbreaks, efforts must be made to reduce the incidence of opioid addiction, identify
cases early, and ensure access to effective treatment.
Preventing opioid addiction requires strategies that foster more cautious and selective OPR
prescribing.However,ifprescribingisreduced without also ensuringaccess to addiction treatment,
the opioid overdose death rate may remain at a historically high level and the use of heroin may
continue to increase. Coordinated efforts from federal agencies, state agencies, health care insurers,
and health care providers are required to address the needs of millions of Americans now struggling
with this chronic, life-threatening disease.
