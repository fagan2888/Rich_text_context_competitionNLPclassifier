Abstract
Objective: We evaluated the association of glucose control with changes in arterial stiffness,
inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress markers.
Methods: Sixty-four patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (glycated hemoglobin
[HbA1c] ! 9%) and hypertension were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two
groups based on their post-treatment HbA1c level: HbA1c 7% (well-controlled group, n ¼ 28)
and HbA1c > 7% (uncontrolled group, n ¼ 36). The pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, and
markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were measured and analyzed.
Results: The patients' mean baseline HbA1c level was 11.7%. There were no differences in any
baseline parameters between the two groups except the duration of diabetes. The mean HbA1c
level was significantly lower at 12 weeks in the well-controlled than uncontrolled group (6.1% vs.
9.0%, respectively), but there were no significant differences in the pulse wave velocity
(0.33 Æ 0.95 vs. 0.36 Æ 1.44 m/s), aortic augmentation index (5.1 Æ 8.3 vs. 0.7 Æ 11.6), or markers
of inflammation and oxidative stress.
Conclusions: Short-term glycemic control did not influence the arterial stiffness in patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyper-
tension are two major risk factors for car-
diovascular disease. Modification of these
risk factors has been shown to reduce car-
diovascular morbidity and mortality.
Glucose control, especially in patients
with T2DM, is associated with decreased
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.1
Although some large randomized con-
trolled studies have shown that intensive
blood glucose control does not improve car-
diovascular mortality in patients with long-
term diabetes and cardiovascular risks,
extended studies have shown some benefit
in cardiovascular events with intensive con-
trol.2­4 Specifically, early intensive glucose
control in patients with newly diagnosed di-
abetes resulted in cardiovascular benefits
that continued after 10 years in the United
Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study
(UKPDS).5 Thus, intensive glucose control
from the early stage of diabetes is very im-
portant to prevent vascular complications.
However, the exact mechanisms of how to
reduce the incidence of cardiovascular dis-
ease by intensive control of hyperglycemia
remain unknown.
Arterial stiffness, the pulse wave velocity
(PWV), and central blood pressure are pre-
dictors of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality.6 T2DM is one factor that
increases arterial stiffness. A study in
China showed a positive association be-
tween glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and
arterial stiffness in patients with T2DM.7
Another study showed that patients with
T2DM and hypertension have greater arte-
rial stiffness than patients with either
T2DM or hypertension.8 However, whether
glycemic control in patients with T2DM
improves arterial stiffness has not been de-
termined. The purpose of the present study
was to evaluate the change in arterial stiff-
ness with glucose control and identify
changes in inflammation and oxidative
stress markers that may be influenced by
arterial stiffness. Thus, we attempted to de-
termine the direct effect of glucose control
on arterial stiffness as an indicator of car-
diovascular disease.
Methods
Study design and patients
This study was performed at St. Paul's
Hospital Diabetes Center at the Catholic
University of Korea (Seoul, Korea). The
inclusion criteria were the presence of
T2DM, a diabetes duration of <10 years,
an age of 30 to 70 years, an HbA1c level of
>9%, body mass index of 20 to 30 kg/m2,
and blood pressure of <140/90 mmHg with
hypertensive medication. Patients who re-
ceived medications that influenced their
blood glucose level (e.g., steroids) and
those with a serum creatinine level of
>1.5 mg/dL, anemia, hepatic disease, ische-
mic heart disease, congestive heart failure
(New York Heart Association class 2), or
severe diabetic complications were exclud-
ed. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients before they participated in
the study. The consent form and study pro-
tocol were approved by the hospital's ethi-
cal review committee.
Patients with uncontrolled blood glucose
levels (HbA1c > 9%) received insulin, oral
hypoglycemic agents (metformin, sulfonyl-
urea, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, or dipep-
tidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor), or combined
insulin and oral agents for 3 months.
After the 3-month blood glucose-lowering
intervention, the patients were divided into
two groups according to their HbA1c level
at 12 weeks: the well-controlled group
(HbA1c < 7%) and the uncontrolled group
(HbA1c ! 7%). We compared the arterial
stiffness index, PWV, central blood pres-
sure, and markers of inflammation and ox-
idative stress between the two groups before
and after improvement in glycemic control.

Measurements
All patients underwent a standard physical
examination and routine clinical laboratory
tests. Arterial blood pressure was measured
twice in the right arm using a mercury
sphygmomanometer in the morning when
patients were resting, and the mean systolic
and diastolic pressures were calculated.
The body mass index was calculated as
body weight divided by the square of the
height (kg/m2).
Arterial stiffness
Arterial stiffness was measured using an
applanation tonometer (SphygmoCor;
AtCor Medical Inc., Sydney, Australia).
One examiner measured the PWV, augmen-
tation index, and central blood pressure
before and after the 3-month glucose-
lowering intervention.
Laboratory measurements
After an overnight fast, venous blood sam-
ples were obtained from each patient. The
fasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol,
triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels were measured using stan-
dard techniques.
Adiponectin, interleukin-6, C-reactive
protein, and plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1
Morning blood samples were collected from
each patient before and after the study fol-
lowing overnight fasting. Serum samples
were immediately frozen and stored at
À70C until analysis.
Adiponectin was measured by enzyme-
linked immune assay (ELISA) (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions. The
levels of interleukin (IL)-6 (Cayman
Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP) (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan),
and plasminogen activator inhibitor
(PAI)-1 (R&D Systems) were measured
using an ELISA kit.
Urinary 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine
After an overnight fast, morning urine sam-
ples were collected from each patient before
and after the study. Urine samples were
stored at À70C until analysis. Urinary 8-
hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine (8-OHDG) was
measured using a commercial ELISA kit
(Cayman Chemical Company).
Statistical analysis
Baseline clinical characteristics were com-
pared between the two groups.
Continuous variables are expressed as
mean Æ standard deviation. Univariate sta-
tistical analysis was performed using the
Mann­Whitney U test for continuous inde-
pendent samples and the chi-square test for
categorical variables. Repeated-measures
analysis of variance using a hierarchical
linear model was performed to analyze
changes in the central hemodynamic
parameters, PWV, and markers of oxidative
stress and inflammation in each group.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS for Windows, version 11.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P value of
<0.05 was considered to indicate a statisti-
cally significant difference with a 95% con-
fidence interval.
Results
Eighty patients were enrolled. Sixteen
patients were excluded because they were
lost to follow-up or withdrew consent.
Sixty-four patients completed the study.
The patients' baseline characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. The mean age was
54.5 years, and the mean baseline HbA1c
level was 11.7%. Twenty-eight patients
(44%) were included in the well-controlled
286 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
group and 36 (56%) were included in the
uncontrolled group according to the
HbA1c level at 12 weeks. The blood pres-
sure levels were not different between the
two groups. However, the mean
duration of T2DM was significantly shorter
in the well-controlled than uncontrolled
group (1.3 vs. 6.6 years, respectively;
P ¼ 0.001).
Baseline measurements of the PWV, aug-
mentation index, and other arterial stiffness
markers were not different except for the
central aortic pulse pressure and augmenta-
tion pressure. The pulse pressure and aug-
mentation pressure were significantly lower
in the well-controlled than uncontrolled
group (P ¼ 0.007 and P ¼ 0.016, respective-
ly) (Table 2). There were also no differences
in the baseline levels of inflammation
markers (hs-CRP and IL-6), adiponectin,
PAI-1, and urinary 8-OHDG between the
two groups.
After 12 weeks, the mean HbA1c level
was 6.1% in the well-controlled group and
9.0% in the uncontrolled group. Table 3
shows the changes in the arterial stiffness
indexes between the two groups. There
were no between-group differences in the
changes in the arterial stiffness indexes
except for the central aortic pulse pressure
and augmentation pressure, which were
maintained at a lower level in the well-
controlled than uncontrolled group
(P ¼ 0.039 and P ¼ 0.044, respectively).
There were no significant changes in the
PWV or aortic augmentation index.
The markers of oxidative stress and
inflammation, including the urinary
8-OHDG, hs-CRP, IL-6, PAI-1, and adipo-
nectin levels, did not improve in the

Discussion
In the present study, the degree of glycemic
control for 12 weeks did not significantly
affect arterial stiffness in patients with
T2DM. In addition, the markers of inflam-
mation and oxidative stress did not change
according to the patients' post-treatment
glycemic status after treatment.
Some studies have reported an associa-
tion between arterial stiffness and glycemic
changes. Yamamoto et al.9 reported that a
2-week admission program in patients with
T2DM improved the brachial-ankle PWV
(baPWV) and metabolic status. In particu-
lar, the baPWV was significantly associated
with the systolic blood pressure and fasting
glucose level. Tomiyama et al.10 conducted
a 3-year observational study of a middle-
aged Japanese male cohort and reported
synergistic acceleration of the baPWV in
subjects with both a raised blood pressure
and raised plasma glucose level compared
with subjects with either a raised blood
pressure or plasma glucose level alone.
However, these studies did not directly eval-
uate whether glucose control improved the
arterial stiffness indexes. Additionally, they
measured peripheral artery indexes, not
central artery indexes.
In the present study, no change was ob-
served in the central arterial stiffness index-
es according to the patients' glucose control
status for 12 weeks. Although arterial stiff-
ness is an outcome of chronic progressive
diabetes, we established a 12-week treat-
ment period because the above-mentioned
study by Yamamoto et al.9 showed im-
provement of the baPWV and metabolic
status within a shorter period of intensive
treatment (2 weeks). However, 12 weeks of
glucose control may be insufficient for ob-
serving a change in arterial stiffness. In the
UKPDS, the cardiovascular benefit of in-
tensive glucose control became apparent
10 years later.11 Another study showed
that intensive blood glucose control re-
duced cardiovascular events after a mean
follow-up of 5.6 years.12 Thus, short-term
glycemic control might be insufficient for
changing the cardiovascular indexes.
However, T2DM was independently

associated with arterial stiffness in roughly
52% of the reported studies compared with
blood pressure and age, which were associ-
ated with arterial stiffness in 90% of the
reported studies.13 It is possible that diabe-
tes is not a main determinant of arterial
stiffness because it accounts for only 5%
of the variation in PWV.13 Therefore, the
glycemic status may have little effect on ar-
terial stiffness, as indicated by our results.
In terms of inflammatory and oxidative
stress markers, several studies have shown
that acute and low-grade chronic inflamma-
tion also increases arterial stiffness.14
Chronic hyperglycemia can augment the
production of proinflammatory cytokines
and other inflammatory pathways in vascu-
lar endothelial cells by forming advanced
glycation end products (AGEs) and AGE-
modified proteins.15 In the present study,
the hs-CRP level tended to decrease in the
well-controlled group, but this did not
achieve statistical significance. This finding
may have been significant if the duration of
the well-controlled state had been longer.
Schnell et al.16 conducted a cluster-
randomized study in the primary care
setting and reported that a reduction in
the hs-CRP level by 12 months was associ-
ated with a reduction in the HbA1c level.
The other inflammation markers, IL-6 and
PAI-1, were also not different between the
groups. Diabetes-associated hyperglycemia
promotes oxidative stress mediated by reac-
tive oxygen formation and the carbonyl
group.17 However, the levels of urinary
8-OHDG and oxidative stress markers in
the well-controlled group also did not
differ from those in the uncontrolled
group after treatment. Another reason for
the lack of differences between the groups is
that all patients received glucose-lowering
treatment. Therefore, the HbA1c levels of
the two groups were significantly lower
than those at baseline. This may have
made it difficult to detect differences be-
tween the two groups.
In the comparison of the parameters be-
tween baseline and 12 weeks, the data of
both groups had deteriorated after 12
weeks of treatment. With the exception of
the hs-CRP level, this finding is inconsistent
with previous studies. Regardless of the
substantial improvement in the HbA1c
level in the well-controlled group, the in-
flammatory and oxidative stress markers
tended to deteriorate. However, these
changes were not significant. We considered
that these results might have been caused by
the small number of patients and the fact
that 12 weeks was too short for correction
of the insulin resistance. Additionally, the
different treatment modalities (various anti-
diabetic drugs, various antihypertensive
drugs, and insulin injection) might have
influenced the patients' insulin resistance.
The central pulse pressure is a predictive
risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity be-
cause it reflects systolic afterload.18,19 The
augmentation pressure also predicts major
cardiovascular events and death indepen-
dently of the pulse pressure.20 At baseline,
the well-controlled group had a shorter di-
abetic duration and lower pulse pressure
and augmentation pressure than the uncon-
trolled group. The pulse pressure and aug-
mentation pressure were still lower than
those in the uncontrolled group after treat-
ment. These findings are plausible because
early glucose control helps to delay cardio-
vascular morbidity.
Conclusion
This study showed a significant difference
not in arterial stiffness according to the
change in the HbA1c level but in the dia-
betic duration between the well-controlled
group and uncontrolled group. There are
two major limitations of this study. The
first is the short follow-up period used for
evaluation of the arterial stiffness, which is
a known outcome of chronic progressive
diabetes. Thus, the results are not
290 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
applicable to patients with long-term glyce-
mic control. The second limitation is the
small number of patients in whom the dif-
ferences in the change in arterial stiffness
were observed. The minor limitation is a
result of the indiscriminate use of various
oral hypoglycemic agents to correct the hy-
perglycemia. Some drugs (e.g., dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 inhibitors) may influence arteri-
al stiffness by improving endothelial dys-
function. However, the results of this
study may suggest that intensive treatment
to ensure good glycemic control from the
early diabetic stage is important to improve
the increased cardiovascular risk in patients
with T2DM.
