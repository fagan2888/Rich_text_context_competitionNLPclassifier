Objective: To evaluate the relationship between insu-
lin resistance­associated metabolic parameters and an-
thropometric measurements with sugar-sweetened bev-
erage intake and physical activity levels.
Design: A cross-sectional analysis of the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected by the
National Center for Health Statistics.
Setting: Nationally representative samples of US ado-
lescents participating in the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey during the years 1999-2004.
Participants: A total of 6967 adolescents aged 12 to 19
years.
Main Exposure: Sugar-sweetened beverage consump-
tion and physical activity levels.
Outcome Measures: Glucose and insulin concentra-
tions, a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resis-
tance (HOMA-IR), total, high-density lipoprotein, and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, tri-
glyceride concentrations, systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure, waist circumference, and body mass index (calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) percentile for age and sex.
Results: Multivariate linear regression analyses showed
that increased sugar-sweetened beverage intake was in-
dependently associated with increased HOMA-IR, sys-
tolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and body mass
index percentile for age and sex and decreased HDL cho-
lesterol concentrations; alternatively, increased physi-
cal activity levels were independently associated with de-
creased HOMA-IR, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
concentrations, and triglyceride concentrations and in-
creased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentra-
tions. Furthermore, low sugar-sweetened beverage in-
take and high physical activity levels appear to modify
each others' effects of decreasing HOMA-IR and triglyc-
eride concentrations and increasing high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol concentrations.
Conclusions: Sugar-sweetened beverage intake and physi-
cal activity levels are each independently associated with
insulin resistance­associated metabolic parameters and
anthropometric measurements in adolescents. More-
over, low sugar-sweetened beverage intake and high physi-
cal activity levels appear to modify each others' effects
on several health-related outcome variables.

THE INCREASING PREVA-
lence of obesity, insulin re-
sistance,andmetabolicsyn-
drome (a group of
conditions associated with
insulin resistance including hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, central adiposity, and
impaired glucose metabolism) in the pe-
diatric population is a global health is-
sue, especially given that these condi-
tions in childhood may be antecedents to
adult disease.1-6 As such, the long-term
public health consequences of these dis-
orders in children and adolescents with re-
spect to premature morbidity and mortal-
ity are significant.
A considerable amount of research over
the past decade has been devoted to study-
ing the genetic aspects of these condi-
tions7-9 and which individuals may be
predisposed to disorders of weight man-
agementorinsulinsensitivity.However,en-

vironmental factors are also undoubtedly contributors to
these conditions' development. Specifically, 2 lifestyle be-
haviorsassociatedwithobesity,insulinresistance,andmeta-
bolic syndrome are (1) high levels of sugar-sweetened bev-
erage (SSB) intake10-14 and (2) low levels of physical activity
(PA).15-21 Dietary modifications and consistent exercise are
thus 2 recommendations typically given by pediatricians
to children and adolescents either at risk for or currently
diagnosed with these disorders.
Experimental studies support the hypothesis that SSBs
may increase energy intake and induce weight gain via
their reduced satiety response, the promotion of a posi-
tive energy balance by liquid calories relative to isoen-
ergetic solid calories, and their dysregulation of energy
homeostasis.22-26 Although not all studies support an as-
sociation between SSB consumption and obesity,27,28 SSB
intake has nonetheless been associated with increased
body weight, increased fat mass, dyslipidemia, and blood
pressure.29,30 Experimental studies also suggest that in-
creased PA improves insulin sensitivity.20,21,31-39 Exer-
cise acutely improves insulin sensitivity for up to 48 hours
because of an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose trans-
port and glycogen synthesis,40,41 and regular exercise train-
ing induces long-term changes within the skeletal muscle
that may improve whole-body insulin sensitivity.35 More-
over, several clinical studies have shown that exercise im-
proves a subject's overall health.42,43
The increasing incidence and prevalence of obesity, in-
sulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in the pediatric
population is well recognized44-47; however, the relation-
ship between insulin resistance­associated metabolic para-
meters and anthropometric measurements with SSB in-
take and PA levels in children and adolescents remains
poorly understood. Furthermore, studies evaluating the as-
sociation of SSB consumption and exercise with these con-
ditions are limited,16,48 which is unfortunate given that a
betterunderstandingofhowdietandPAarerelatedtothese
conditions may provide clinical and public health infor-
mation for prevention and treatment strategies.
Thus, to evaluate the relationship between insulin re-
sistance­associated metabolic parameters and anthropo-
metric measurements with SSB intake and PA levels in the
US adolescent population, we analyzed these associations
using data from the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) during the years 1999-2004.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION
The NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
is designed to monitor the health and nutritional status of the
US civilian noninstitutionalized population. Since 1999,
NHANES has been planned and conducted as a continuous an-
nual survey, and data are released in 2-year periods (eg, 1999-
2000, 2001-2002). A nationally representative sample is se-
lected annually using a stratified multistage probability cluster
sample design49; oversampling Mexican American and black in-
dividuals, adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, persons 60 years and
older, low-income white individuals, and pregnant women per-
mits more precise estimates for these groups. This study is based
on data obtained from NHANES 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and
2003-2004, as these were the most recently available NHANES
that had released all of the data needed for the inclusion cri-
teria, exclusion criteria, and outcome variables. The NHANES
protocol was approved by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics institutional review board, and written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants aged 18 years and older;
for participants younger than 18 years, written informed as-
sent was obtained in addition to parent or guardian consent.
This study was approved by the institutional review board at
the University of California, Davis.
DATA COLLECTION
The NHANES protocol consists of a home interview per-
formed by a trained interviewer followed by a visit to an ex-
amination center where participants underwent physical ex-
aminations, provided blood and urine samples, and completed
additional questionnaires. The details of the participant exami-
nations and laboratory assessments are available on the NHANES
Web site.49 For our study, only data from participants aged 12
to 19 years were analyzed; individuals were excluded from analy-
ses if they were pregnant and/or used steroids, blood glucose
regulators, insulin, other antidiabetic agents, growth hor-
mones, or sex hormones.
MEASUREMENTS
Outcome variables included glucose levels, insulin levels, ho-
meostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
measurements, total cholesterol levels, high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (LDL-C) levels, triglyceride (TG) levels, systolic blood
pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference
(WC), and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in ki-
lograms divided by height in meters squared) percentile for age
and sex (per the National Center for Health Statistics
references).50 The HOMA-IR ([fasting glucose in millimoles per
liter  fasting insulin in milliunits per milliliter]/22.5),51 LDL-C,
and TG results were limited to those who had completed at least
an 8-hour fast. Mean WC is presented as the least squares mean,
controlling for age and sex.
DEFINITIONS
Sugar-sweetened beverage information was obtained through
a 24-hour dietary recall interview. (In NHANES 2003-2004, the
24-hour recall was assessed on 2 separate days; the first day
was an in-person interview comparable with the previous
NHANES study periods' primary interview mode, whereas the
second day was a telephone interview 3-10 days later. For con-
sistency in the methodology of data collection among the study
periods, only the first day of the NHANES 2003-2004 24-hour
recall was used in our analyses.) Sugar-sweetened beverages were
defined as caloric soft drinks, colas, sugar-sweetened fruit drinks,
or other SSBs; pure fruit juices and diet soft drinks were not
included. Sugar-sweetened beverage intake in grams for each
reported beverage was divided by 250 g (a serving equivalent;
approximately 8 ounces or a cup of beverage) and summed for
each adolescent. In each NHANES analyzed, low SSB intake was
defined as the lowest quintile (20th percentile) of the sum
of the number of SSB serving equivalents a subject consumed
per day; medium was defined as the 2nd to 4th quintiles (20th
to 80th percentile); high was defined as the highest quintile
(80th percentile). Units of SSB intake are defined as the num-
ber of SSB serving equivalents per day. Physical activity infor-
mation was obtained during the interview questionnaire. Low

PA was defined as the lowest quintile (20th percentile) of the
sum of (the mean number of times a subject did activity per
day)  (the average duration of each time in minutes)  (the
metabolic equivalent score)52,53; medium was defined as the 2nd
to 4th quintiles (20th to 80th percentile); high was de-
fined as the highest quintile (80th percentile).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed with SUDAAN version 9.0
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina) using techniques appropriate for the complex
NHANES survey design. All of the analyses used the
NHANES-provided sampling weights that were calculated to
take into account unequal probabilities of selection resulting
from the sample design, nonresponse, and planned over-
sampling of selected subgroups so the results are representa-
tive of the US community-dwelling population. Dietary and ac-
tivity variables were analyzed both as continuous variables and
in quintiles to minimize the chance that a small number of ex-
treme observations would have undue influence on the re-
sults. Descriptive statistics summarize the data and are ex-
pressed as the mean (standard error [SE]). Multivariate linear
regression analyses were performed to determine indepen-
dent associations between each outcome variable and the num-
ber of serving equivalents of SSBs consumed and/or the levels
of PA after adjusting for age, sex, race, and energy intake (in
kilocalories). Analyses involving female subjects were ad-
justed for the occurrence or nonoccurrence of menarche. All
P values are 2-sided and statistical significance was estab-
lished a priori at =.05.
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS
The baseline characteristics of the study participants are
shown in Table 1. A total of 6967 adolescents were stud-
ied; the mean age of the participants was 15.5 years, 51.1%
of the participants were male, and 48.9% of the partici-
pants were female. The ethnic distribution of the partici-
pantswas62.1%white,14.8%black,10.9%MexicanAmeri-
can, 5.3% other (including multiracial), and 6.9% other
Hispanic. For the metabolic evaluations, 442 individuals
(approximately6% of the study population) were ex-
cluded from analyses because of pregnancy and/or the use
of steroids, blood glucose regulators, insulin, other anti-
diabetic agents, growth hormones, or sex hormones.
METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND
ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS
ASSOCIATED WITH SSB INTAKE
The characteristics of the low-, medium-, and high-SSB in-
take groups as well as the results of the multivariate lin-
ear regression analyses evaluating the relationship be-
tween SSB intake and insulin resistance­associated
metabolic parameters and anthropometric measure-
ments are shown in Table 2. The low-SSB intake group
consumed a mean of 0.01 SSB serving equivalents (ap-
proximately 0.1 oz) per day (SE, 0.003; range, 0-0.4 [ap-
proximately 0-3 oz]); the medium­SSB intake group
consumed a mean of 2.5 SSB serving equivalents (approxi-
mately 20 oz) per day (SE, 0.03; range, 0.5-4.8 [approxi-
mately 4-38 oz]), and the high­SSB intake group con-
sumedameanof7.4SSBservingequivalents(approximately
60 oz) per day (SE, 0.2; range, 4.9-33.4 [approximately
40-266 oz]). Each additional SSB serving equivalent con-
sumed per day was associated with a 5% increase in
HOMA-IR, a 0.16-mm Hg increase in SBP, a 0.47-cm in-
creaseinWC,a0.90-percentileincreaseinBMIforage,and
a 0.48-mg/dL decrease in HDL-C concentrations.
METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND
ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS
ASSOCIATED WITH PA LEVELS
The characteristics of the low-, medium-, and high-PA
level groups as well as the results of the multivariate lin-
ear regression analyses evaluating the relationship be-
tween PA levels and insulin resistance-associated meta-
bolic parameters and anthropometric measurements are
shown in Table 3. In the low-PA group, 14.4% re-
ported having engaged in at least 1 moderate activity dur-
ing the past 30 days, whereas 7.4% reported having en-
gaged in at least 1 vigorous activity during the past 30
days. In the medium-PA group, 75.4% reported having
engaged in at least 1 moderate activity during the past
30 days, whereas 79.8% reported having engaged in at
least 1 vigorous activity during the past 30 days. In the

high-PA group, 74.6% reported having engaged in at least
1 moderate activity during the past 30 days, whereas 96.9%
reported having engaged in at least 1 vigorous activity
during the past 30 days. Each incremental increase in PA
level per day was associated with a 0.03% decrease in
HOMA-IR, a 0.004-mg/dL decrease in LDL-C concen-
trations, a 0.01-mg/dL decrease in TG concentrations, and
a 0.001-mg/dL increase in HDL-C concentrations.
METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND
ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS
ASSOCIATED WITH SSB INTAKE AND PA LEVELS
Because the combination of dietary modification (with
decreased SSB intake) and exercise (with increased PA
levels) are typically recommended to children and ado-
lescents either at risk for or currently diagnosed with obe-
sity, insulin resistance, or metabolic syndrome, we evalu-
ated the factors associated with the combination of each
extreme (ie, low SSB intake and high PA vs high SSB in-
take and low PA level); the characteristics of the 2 groups
as well as the results of the multivariate linear regres-
sion analyses evaluating the relationship between low SSB
intake and high PA levels with insulin resistance­
associated metabolic parameters and anthropometric mea-
surements are shown in Table 4. The combination of
low SSB intake and high PA levels was significantly as-
sociated with increased HDL-C concentrations, a lower
HOMA-IR, and lower TG concentrations. Furthermore,
the finding that the  coefficients for these 3 outcome
variables (HDL-C concentrations, HOMA-IR, and TG con-
centrations) are greater with the combination of low SSB

SEX-SPECIFIC SUBGROUP ANALYSES
Because differences between the sexes may influence the
metabolic parameters and anthropometric measurements
associated with SSB intake, PA levels, and their combina-
tion, sex-specific subgroup analyses were also performed;

In female adolescents, each additional SSB serving
equivalent consumed per day was associated with a 7%
increase in HOMA-IR, a 2.25-mg/dL increase in TG con-
centrations, a 0.38-mm Hg increase in SBP, a 0.75-cm in-
crease in WC, a 0.84-percentile increase in BMI for age,
and a 0.73-mg/dL decrease in HDL-C concentration. How-
ever, in male adolescents, each additional SSB serving
equivalent consumed per day was associated with a
0.29-cm increase in WC, a 0.78-percentile increase in BMI
for age, and a 0.35-mg/dL decrease in HDL-C concen-
tration. Alternatively, each incremental increase in PA
level in female adolescents was only associated with a 0.01-
mg/dL decrease in TG concentrations, whereas each in-
cremental increase in PA level in male adolescents was
associated with a 0.04% decrease in HOMA-IR, a 0.005-
mg/dL decrease in LDL-C concentrations, a 0.01-mg/dL
decrease in TG concentrations, and a 0.001-cm de-
crease in WC. Furthermore, although the combination
of low SSB intake and high PA levels in female adoles-
cents revealed no significant associations with any insu-
lin resistance­associated metabolic parameters or an-
thropometric measurements, the combination of low SSB
intake and high PA levels in male adolescents was sig-
nificantly associated with increased HDL-C concentra-
tions, a lower HOMA-IR, and lower TG concentrations.
COMMENT
In these nationally representative samples of US adoles-
cents, we found significant differences between the de-
grees of SSB intake and PA levels with insulin resistance­
associated metabolic parameters and anthropometric
measurements.
Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that in-
creased SSB consumption was independently associated
with increased HOMA-IR, SBP, WC, and BMI percentile
for age and sex and decreased HDL-C concentrations; al-
ternatively, increased PA levels were independently as-
sociated with decreased HOMA-IR, LDL-C concentra-
tions, and TG concentrations and increased HDL-C
concentrations. Furthermore, low SSB intake and high
PA levels appear to modify each others' effects on de-
creasing HOMA-IR and TG concentrations and increas-
ing HDL-C concentrations. These findings thus support
the promotion of each lifestyle parameter (ie, decreased
SSB consumption and increased PA levels) in children
or adolescents either at risk for or currently diagnosed
with obesity, insulin resistance, or metabolic syndrome.
Subgroup analyses based on sex also showed that SSB
intake and PA levels were independently associated with
insulin resistance­associated metabolic parameters and
anthropometric differences; however, the associations of

each were sex-specific. In female adolescents, increased
SSB consumption was associated with an increase in
HOMA-IR, TG concentrations, SBP, WC, and BMI per-
centile and a decrease in HDL-C concentrations. How-
ever, in male adolescents, SSB consumption was only as-
sociated with an increase in WC and BMI percentile and
a decrease in HDL-C concentrations. Alternatively, in-
creased PA levels in female adolescents were only asso-
ciated with a decrease in TG concentrations, whereas in-
creased PA levels in male adolescents were associated with
a decrease in HOMA-IR, LDL-C concentrations, TG con-
centrations, and WC. Furthermore, although the com-
bination of low-SSB intake and high PA levels revealed
no significant associations with any insulin resistance­
associated metabolic parameters or anthropometric mea-
surements in female adolescents, the combination of low
SSB intake and high PA levels was significantly associ-
ated with a lower HOMA-IR, lower TG concentrations,
and increased HDL-C concentrations, just as it was when
the cohort was studied in its entirety.
The sex-related differences that we observed with re-
spect to the association of SSB intake and PA levels with
insulin resistance­associated metabolic parameters and
anthropometric measurements are intriguing; however,
given the many physiological differences that exist be-
tween male and female adolescents during the adoles-
cent years and our limited ability in female adolescents
and inability in male adolescents to assess and control
for pubertal status, our results are not necessarily sur-
prising. Furthermore, many other variables that we could
not account for during our analyses such as a subject's
dietary behavior and precise body composition measure-
ments may have influenced our results.
Sugar-sweetened beverages may negatively affect he-
patic metabolism and energy homeostasis,24 and the con-
sumption of SSBs has been implicated in many10,11,24,54 but
not all27,28 studies as a contributing factor to the increased
incidence and prevalence of overweight and obesity. The
odds of a pediatric patient becoming obese--and there-
fore at risk for developing metabolic syndrome--has been
reported to increase byapproximately60% for each addi-
tional SSB serving per day,12 and individuals who con-
sume a large portion of their daily energy in the form of
SSBs are reported to have increased body weight, in-
creased fat mass, dyslipidemia, and high blood pres-
sure.29,30 Although discrepancy exists in the literature re-
garding the association of SSB intake with a subject's
metabolic status (which may in large part be because of
the many types of studies that have been performed [ie,
prospective, cross-sectional, and retrospective--all with
different inclusion/exclusion criteria and means of data
analysis]), our study shows an independent relationship
between increased SSB intake and increased HOMA-IR,
SBP, WC, and BMI percentile for age and sex and de-
creased HDL-C concentrations, thus supporting the ben-
eficial relationship of limited SSB intake with insulin
resistance­associated parameters.
Alternatively, PA causes more of its metabolic-
changing effects by its action on skeletal muscle, and regu-
lar exercise induces long-term changes within the skeletal
muscle that improve whole-body insulin sensitivity.35,40,41

regarding the association of PA levels with overweight and
obesity in children, data from large adult studies42,43 have
convincingly shown the metabolic benefits of increased ex-
ercise. Moreover, a recent study in adolescents showed that
moderate PA was positively related to improved glucose
metabolism and resting energy expenditure.55 Our study
further supports the metabolic and health benefits of ex-
ercise and shows an independent relationship between in-
creased PA levels and decreased HOMA-IR, LDL-C con-
centrations, and TG concentrations and increased HDL-C
concentrations.
Importantly, the finding that the absolute values of the
 coefficients from our multivariate linear regression
analyses were consistently smaller for the PA analyses than
for the SSB analyses does not diminish the significance
of exercise and its relationship with insulin resistance­
associated parameters; rather, it is a reflection of the meth-
odology used. Sugar-sweetened beverage intake was de-
fined as the number of SSB serving equivalents a subject
consumed per day, whereas PA levels were defined as (the
mean number of times a subject did activity per day) 
(the average duration of each time in minutes)  (the
metabolic equivalent score). As would be expected from
its determination from multiple variables, a much wider
range of PA levels were calculated in the study popula-
tion than SSB intake levels, influencing the effect of a single
unit of incremental change on the outcome. However,
based on our model, even a small increase in daily exer-
cise by an individual (eg, increasing the mean number
of times a subject engaged in PA from 2 to 3 per day and
increasing the average duration of physical activity from
10 to 15 minutes) would have a profound effect on their
calculated PA level (increasing it by 225%), leading to
larger changes in the outcome variables than would be
expected by the small value of the  coefficient.
GiventhatthebiologicaleffectsofSSBconsumptionand
exercise are different, we were not surprised to find that
the combination of low SSB intake and high PA levels ap-
peared to modify each others' effects on several insulin re-
sistance­associated parameters. However, the fact that we
only observed this effect for HOMA-IR, HDL-C concen-
trations, and TG concentrations, but not the other out-
come variables, is interesting and requires further investi-
gationwithwell-designedprospectivestudies.Nevertheless,
HOMA-IR, HDL-C concentrations, and TG concentra-
tions are commonly used in clinical practice as markers of
a subject's metabolic status, and thus our data suggest that
promoting decreased SSB consumption and increased lev-
els of exercise in adolescents is important for overall health.
Our study has several significant limitations. First, be-
cause our study is cross-sectional, all we are able to re-
port are associations as opposed to causality. Second, be-
cause the pubertal status of our subjects was not
documented in the NHANES periods that we studied, we
are unable to adjust our analyses for the subjects' degree
of sexual maturation. Third, studies such as ours that use
questionnaire data have inherent limitations: (1) the re-
call method is subject to inaccuracy and bias, especially
with behaviors such as dietary habits56 and levels of ex-
ercise52; and (2) an individual's dietary habits and levels
of exercise can vary greatly from one day to the next, lim-
iting the reliability of short-term recall on long-term pat-
terns. However, given that overweight subjects often un-
derreport their levels of energy intake56 and less active
adolescents often overestimate their degree of physical
fitness,52 we can have confidence in our results because
these biases would be expected to diminish rather than
enhance our ability to find significant associations be-
tween SSB consumption and PA levels with insulin re-
sistance-associated measures.
In summary, we report that SSB intake and PA levels
are each independently associated with insulin resistance­
associated metabolic parameters and anthropometric mea-
surements in adolescents; moreover, low SSB intake and
high PA levels appear to modify each others' effect on
several health-related outcome variables. Thus, al-
though prospective studies are needed to directly test the
effects of dietary modification and consistent exercise on
the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and meta-
bolic syndrome in the pediatric population, pediatri-
cians should continue promoting these lifestyle modifi-
cations in efforts to improve overall health.
