The last few decades have witnessed a proliferation of
research related to the construct of resilience and its health
implications in different populations (Norris, Tracy, & Galea,
2009). Resilience research has been extended from its origi-
nal focus on successful adaptation among children exposed
to adversities (Cowan, Cowan, & Schulz, 1996) to adult
populations, and has more recently encompassed optimal
functioning (Schetter & Dolbier, 2011). Despite the wealth
of data demonstrating the health and adaptive benefits of
resilience, issues related to the proper conceptualization of
this construct have recently emerged. Resilience has been
operationalized in at least two ways in the literature. First, it
has referred to the possible trajectories (e.g., absence of
symptoms or recovery) following exposure to a trauma (e.g.,
Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno, Galea, Bucciareli, & Vlahov,
2006; Carver, 1998; Norris et al., 2009). Second, it has been
defined as the personal qualities and social resources that
influence the aforementioned trajectories (e.g., Connor &
Davidson, 2003; Friborg, Hjemdal, Martinussen, &
Rosenvinge, 2009). In other words, the term resilience has
been used to denote both an adaptive outcome and the ante-
cedents/predictors of that outcome, which is conceptually
confusing (Smith, Tooley, Christopher, & Kay, 2010; Smith
et al., 2008). As resilience was originally conceptualized as a
trajectory of possible outcomes after exposure to a traumatic
event or as a recovery from adversity, it can only be opera-
tionalized in a longitudinal context in which a person's psy-
chological response to adversity is monitored over time.
Individuals are considered to exhibit resilience if their
psychological functioning or mental health status returns to
its preexposure level after a traumatic encounter (e.g.,
Bonanno, 2004). Specific personal qualities and social
resources may predict who exhibits resilience over time, but
these qualities and resources are not identical to outcomes.
Smith et al. (2008) suggested that it would be more appropri-
ate to consider these qualities and resources as "resilience
resources." However, most existing measures of resilience
have been developed exclusively to assess resilience
resources rather than outcomes.
The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was developed to mea-
sure an individual's ability to bounce back or recover from
stress (Smith et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2008), and is consid-
ered to relate more closely to the original meaning of resil-
ience. The ability to bounce back from stress, or "resilience,"
is conceptually different from "resilience resources."
"Resilience" is oriented toward stress (Smith et al., 2010),
whereas "resilience resources" such as optimism and self-
esteem have broader effects because their influences are not
restricted to the domain of stress or negative events (Smith &
Zautra, 2008). Smith et al. (2010) emphasized that although
the BRS is a measure of a person's belief in how well he or
she can bounce back rather than his or her success in doing

Using the Brief Resilience Scale to
Assess Chinese People's Ability to
Bounce Back From Stress
Julian C. L. Lai1 and Xiaodong Yue1
Abstract
This study examined the utility of an adapted version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) to measure Chinese undergraduates'
ability to bounce back from stress. The BRS together with measures tapping optimism, self-esteem, pessimism, and physical
health were administered to 547 Hong Kong and 268 mainland Chinese undergraduates. The BRS was found to measure
one single construct and exhibited convergent validity in both samples. Further analyses using a path analytic model showed
that the BRS scores substantially mediated the link between the two positive traits (optimism and self-esteem) and physical
health in the two samples. The results suggested that the BRS is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring Chinese
undergraduates' ability to bounce back from stress. The implications for further research related to resilience in Chinese
people are discussed.

so, this belief may serve as a prerequisite of the individual's
actual ability to bounce back. As such, the effect of the BRS
can be considered as analogous to that of self-efficacy mea-
sures, which involve an individual's beliefs about how well
he or she can do something rather than his or her actual
performance.
The six-item BRS has been shown to be a reliable and
valid measure of one's ability to bounce back from stress
(Smith et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2008). The construct identi-
fied by the BRS is not the same as that measured by estab-
lished scales such as the Connor­Davidson Resilience Scale
(CD-RISC) and the Ego Resilience Scale, with which it is
only moderately correlated (Smith et al., 2008). The BRS
reliably predicts both affective and physical health measures
when the effects of other resilience resources are controlled
(Smith et al., 2010). Moreover, the effect of the BRS is more
consistent across different health outcomes compared with
resilience resource measures. In a study conducted by Smith
et al. (2009), higher scores on the BRS were shown to predict
quicker habituation to heat and cold pain in women, provid-
ing additional support for the validity of the scale.
Research related to resilience in Chinese populations has
emerged only recently. The construct has been operational-
ized as a composite of optimism, self-esteem, and perceived
control, and has been shown to predict a better response to
rehabilitation in Chinese cardiac patients (Chan, Lai, &
Wong, 2006) and more adaptive health outcomes in nurses
(Chan, 2006), and to moderate the effect of daily problems
on the positive well-being of Chinese undergraduates (Lai &
Mak, 2009). Although this operationalization has been
shown to apply to both Western (e.g., Taylor & Brown, 1988;
Taylor, Kemeny, Reed, Bower, & Grunenewald, 2000;
Wanberg & Banas, 2000) and Chinese populations (e.g.,
Chan et al., 2006), it tends to obscure the differential contri-
butions of the three positive qualities, and is not immune to
the problem identified by Smith et al. (2008).
Resilience in Chinese people has also been studied using
an adapted version of the CD-RISC developed by Connor and
Davidson (2003; Yu & Zhang, 2007). However, similar to
other resilience measures, the CD-RISC was devised to iden-
tify the resilience resources that predict a person's adaptive
outcomes rather than his or her ability to bounce back. Further
research on resilience in Chinese people would be hampered
without a reliable and valid measure of the construct. The
present study addresses this issue by validating the BRS
among Chinese undergraduate participants from Hong Kong
and Nanjing, China. Comparable Chinese samples were
recruited to ensure compatibility. Nanjing University was
selected for three reasons: (a) both Hong Kong and Nanjing
are key metropolitan cities in China; (b) the City University
of Hong Kong and Nanjing University are comparable in
terms of their rankings among Asian universities, with the
City University of Hong Kong ranking 19th and Nanjing
University ranking 28th according to the Quacquarelli
Symonds (QS) ranking of Asian universities in 2013/2014;
and (c) the two universities are located in the center of the city
and have similarly sized student populations.
One's ability to bounce back is different from the resilience
qualities identified by the conventional measures of resilience.
Although Smith et al. (2008; Smith et al., 2010) empirically
demonstrated this observation, studies have not yet addressed
the issue of how such a personal quality is conceptually related
to resilience resources. As the BRS is supposed to measure
one's ability to bounce back from stress, which is thought to be
affected by resilience resources (Smith et al., 2008), one of the
most reasonable hypotheses is that the ability to bounce back
can be treated as a mediator of the link between resilience
resources and health outcomes. This formulation is also com-
patible with the core feature of psychological resilience sug-
gested by cognitive adaptation theory (Taylor & Brown,
1988), that is, the mobilization and augmentation of personal
qualities including optimism, self-esteem, and perceived con-
trol in response to adversities. The augmentation of these resil-
ience resources potentiates an individual's ability to cope and
increases the likelihood that the individual will bounce back
from stress. In other words, resilience resources lead to resil-
ience (the ability to recover from stress) in the individual,
which, in turn, predicts his or her health outcomes. The present
study tests this conjecture using path analysis. Verification of
the following hypotheses would lend strong support to the
validity of the construct measured by the BRS.
1. The BRS items measure one single construct. This is
tested using exploratory factor analytic procedures.
2. In terms of convergent validity, the BRS is positively
correlated with measures of optimism, self-esteem,
and physical health, and negatively correlated with
measures of pessimism.
3. In terms of incremental utility, BRS scores are able to
predict a significant proportion of physical health
variance beyond that explained by other resilience-
related qualities.
4. BRS scores mediate the link between resilience
resources and physical health. In the present study, a
path model is used to delineate the effects of resil-
ience resources and a person's ability to bounce back
on his or her physical health. As depicted in Figure 1,
the ability to bounce back as indexed by the BRS
scores mediates the effect of the two resilience
resources (optimism and self-esteem) on an individu-
al's physical health. These two attributes are consid-
ered because studies have found their reactive
augmentation and that associated with perceived con-
trol to be crucial for successful adaptation to adver-
sity (Taylor & Brown, 1988; Taylor et al., 2000).
Moreover, they form the core components of positive
psychological capital (e.g., Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &
Norman, 2007). The latter has been shown to predict
a number of positive organizational outcomes (e.g.,
Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007).
Lai and Yue 3
Although research conducted under the rubric of resil-
ience has focused on the mental health effects of the con-
struct, the present study uses physical health as its outcome
measure for the following reasons. First, the physical health
benefits of specific resilience resources have been well docu-
mented in the literature (e.g., optimism, Rasmussen, Scheier,
& Greenhouse, 2009; and positive emotions, Tugade,
Fredrickson, & Barrett, 2004). Resilience resources have
been shown to have a smaller effect on physical health than
on mental health, but the effect is consistent and significant
across studies (e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2009). The exclusive
focus of the resilience research on mental health outcomes is
not justified and has created a large knowledge gap, one that
the present study attempts to fill by focusing on physical
health outcomes. Second, recent evidence has shown that
resilience resources are associated with a number of physio-
logical benefits that may explain the better physical health of
resilient individuals. These include a stronger vagal tone
(Smeets, 2010), faster cardiovascular recovery from labora-
tory stressors (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004), and lower sali-
vary cortisol levels in the morning (Lai et al., 2010; Lai et al.,
2005). This study's focus on physical health addresses an
issue of growing importance and thus makes a significant
contribution to the literature.
Method
Participants
Hong Kong sample. The Hong Kong sample comprised 198
male and 349 female undergraduates recruited from a univer-
sity in Hong Kong. The mean age of the sample was 21.26
years (SD = 1.84 years). The mean age of the male partici-
pants was 21.35 years (SD = 1.92) and that of the female
participants was 21.22 years (SD = 1.80). All of the partici-
pants were ethnic Chinese and took part in the study anony-
mously. The participants were given cash shopping coupons
of HKD50 each for contributing their time and effort to the
study.
Mainland sample.The mainland sample consisted of 268
undergraduates (149 men and 119 women) recruited from
Nanjing University in China. The mean age of the sample
was 20.58 years (SD = 1.63). The mean age of the male
participants was 20.39 years (SD = 1.48) and that of the
female participants was 20.82 years (SD = 1.78). Like those
in the Hong Kong sample, they took part in the study volun-
tarily and anonymously. However, they were given course
credits instead of cash coupons in return for their
contribution.
Procedure
Email advertisements were sent to undergraduate students
enrolled in psychology courses at a Hong Kong university
during the fall semester of 2009. The experimenter contacted
students who showed interest in taking part in the study and
briefed them about its nature and requirements. As a result,
547 students were recruited and subsequently tested in
groups of 5 to 20 throughout the semester. The procedure
used to recruit the Hong Kong sample was also adopted to
recruit participants in Nanjing. Recruitment was conducted
and completed in spring 2011, with 268 students volunteer-
ing to take part.
The participants in both samples were asked to complete
a set of questionnaires consisting of the following scales
written in Chinese: (a) the revised Life Orientation Test (Lai,
2009), (b) the Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ; Ng,
2007), (c) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES; Cheng &
Hamid, 1995), (d) the Chinese Hopelessness Scale (C-HOPE;
Lai & Yue, 2000), and (e) an adapted version of the BRS.
These tests were administered to the two samples in a
standardized manner. The experimenter taught the partici-
pants how to fill out the scales to ensure correct completion
during each test session. It took each participant an average
of 20 min to complete the questionnaire. At the end of the
session, the participants were debriefed about the nature and
aims of the study and given a chance to ask questions about
the tests they had just completed and the research in general.
They were then given a shopping coupon of HKD50 (Hong
Kong sample) or course credits (mainland sample) for their
participation.
Measures
Resilience.The participants' resilience was measured using
an adaptation of the BRS developed by Smith et al. (2008).
The original English BRS consisted of six items identifying
one's ability to bounce back from stress. As the BRS had
never been translated into Chinese, a back-translation proce-
dure was adopted to translate the six items into Chinese. The
experimenter translated the items into Chinese, and a post-
graduate psychology student then back-translated them into
English. The Chinese translations were modified until each
item could be properly back-translated into English. To com-
plete the scale, the participants were asked to indicate the
extent to which they agreed with each of the six items accord-
ing to a 5-point rating scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 =
strongly agree). The BRS was scored by reverse-coding
Figure 1. Hypothesized path model: Resilience traits, resilience,
and physical health.

Items 2, 4, and 6 and calculating the sum of all six items. The
scale exhibited acceptable internal consistency in both sam-
ples, with Cronbach's  values equal to .76 and .72 in the
Hong Kong and mainland samples, respectively.
Optimism. Optimism was measured by a Chinese version of
the revised Life Orientation Test (CLOT-R) adapted by Lai
(2003) and subsequently validated by Lai et al. (2005), Lai
(2009), Lai and Mak (2009), and Chan et al. (2006) using
different Hong Kong Chinese samples. The six-item CLOT-
R is based on the English version of the revised LOT (Scheier,
Carver, & Bridges, 1994), with half of the items worded
positively and the other half worded negatively. All of the
items of the adapted scale were back-translated versions of
their corresponding items in the revised English LOT except
for the second item, which was developed by Lai (2003) to
more precisely reflect a non-expectancy of positive out-
comes ("Looking into the future, I do not see any positive
scenarios"). Studies have shown the scale to be internally
consistent for Hong Kong Chinese samples, with Cronbach's
 values ranging from .72 to .78 (Chan et al., 2006; Lai,
2009; Lai et al., 2005; Lai & Mak, 2009).
The respondents rated the extent to which they agreed or
disagreed with each of the six items according to a 5-point
scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Filler items
were not included in the test. The participants were assigned
optimism scores, which were calculated by adding the rat-
ings of the positively worded items to the reversed ratings of
the negatively worded items. The Cronbach's  values were
.81 for the Hong Kong Chinese undergraduate sample and
.64 for the mainland sample, which were comparable with
the values reported in past studies (Chan et al., 2006; Lai,
2009; Lai et al., 2005; Lai & Mak, 2009).
Self-esteem.Self-esteem was measured using a nine-item
revised Chinese version of the Rosenberg SES. One of the
negatively worded items, "I wish I could have more respect
for myself," was syntactically problematic in Chinese, and
the actual meaning was lost due to the differences in syntax
after the item was back-translated (Cheng & Hamid, 1995).
Moreover, this problematic item was the only one that raised
the  coefficient when omitted from the calculation, and it
was thus excluded. The scale showed a high internal consis-
tency. Cronbach's  values of .89 and .86 were obtained for
the Hong Kong and mainland samples, respectively, which
were comparable with those reported in recent studies
involving Chinese cardiac patients (Chan et al., 2006; Cron-
bach's  = .82) and Chinese undergraduates (Lai & Mak,
2009, Cronbach's  = .85).
Pessimism.
Pessimism was measured according to the
C-HOPE, adapted by Shek (1995) from the original version
developed by Beck, Weissman, Lester, and Trexler (1974) to
measure each participant's expectations about himself or
herself and his or her future life. The scale consists of 11
items negatively worded items and 9 positively worded
items. The respondents were asked to indicate the extent to
which each item applied to them according to a 6-point scale
(1 = strongly disagree; 6 = strongly agree). The scale was
scored in the pessimistic or hopeless direction. It exhibited
acceptable internal consistency with past studies involving
Hong Kong Chinese people (e.g., Cronbach's  values = .88
and .83; Lai & Yue, 2000). In this case, Cronbach's  values
of .87 and .85 were obtained in the Hong Kong and mainland
samples, respectively.
Physical health.Physical health was measured using a Chi-
nese version of the PHQ (Schat, Kelloway, & Desmarais,
2005), which was translated from the English version via a
back-translation procedure used by Ng (2007). The scale
consists of 14 items (e.g., "How often have you experienced
headaches?") that measure four distinct dimensions of
somatic symptoms, including sleep disturbances, headaches,
gastrointestinal problems, and respiratory illness. The
respondents were asked to rate the frequency with which
they experienced the symptoms on a 7-point frequency scale
ran (1 = not at all; 7 = all the time) in the past month. Except
for Item 4 ("How often has your sleep been peaceful and
undisturbed?"), the endorsement of which indicated an
absence of symptoms, the scores for the other 13 items, the
endorsement of which indicated the presence of symptoms,
were reversed before scoring. A total PHQ score was calcu-
lated by adding the Item 4 rating to the ratings of the remain-
ing 13 items. Higher scores generally reflected better physical
health. Studies have demonstrated the PHQ to have an
acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's  = .79; Schat et
al., 2005). The Cronbach's  values of the PHQ in the Hong
Kong and mainland samples were .85 and .78, respectively.
Schat et al. (2005) showed that the PHQ can measure four
factors that correspond to the different aspects of somatic
symptoms, including headaches, sleep disturbances, respira-
tory infections, and gastrointestinal problems. However,
their study also showed that these four factors are subsumed
under a single higher order dimension of physical health
(Schat et al., 2005). In the present study, ratings of the 14
items were used to calculate an overall index of somatic
health, and the PHQ was used as a criterion for validating the
BRS rather than examining the different aspects of physical
health.
Results
Table 1 summarizes the means, the standard deviations, and
Cronbach's  values of the scales measuring the two resil-
ience qualities (optimism, self-esteem), pessimism, resil-
ience, and physical health. The missing values were replaced
with the mean values of the actual items. For the Hong Kong
sample, 22 mean values were attributed to 22 participants
(CLOT-R = 2, C-HOPE = 7, BRS = 2, SES = 1, PHQ = 10).
For the Nanjing sample, 28 mean values were attributed to
Lai and Yue 5
25 participants (CLOT-R = 7, C-HOPE = 7, BRS = 2, SES =
2, PHQ = 10). In view of the small percentage of imputed
data, their effect on test statistics and standard errors was
expected to be minimal. Cronbach's  values ranged from
.64 to .89 in the two samples, indicating internal consistency
among the scales.
Cronbach's  values of the BRS in the two samples were
.76 and .72, respectively, which were comparable with those
reported by Smith et al. (2008). Table 2 inspects the sample
correlations and indicates that the BRS scores were signifi-
cantly correlated with each of the two resilience resources (rs
= .311-.539, ps < .001), pessimism (rs = -.35 and -.537, ps
< .001), and the PHQ scores (rs = .306 and .362, ps < .001)
in the predicted directions. This correlation pattern provided
modest support for the convergent validity of the BRS in the
two undergraduate samples.
Factor Structure and Construct Validity
Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted for the
responses to the six items of the BRS in each of the two sam-
ples. For the Hong Kong sample, a single factor (eigenvalue
= 2.80) that explained 46.73% of the total variance was
extracted. Inspection of the scree plot also suggested a one-
factor solution (initial eigenvalues = 2.80, .94, .76, .56, .52,
and .42). The Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO) measure (.82)
and Bartlett's test, 2(15) = 766.54, p < .0001, clearly showed
that the correlations among the BRS items were strong
enough for factor analysis. A similar pattern of results was
observed in the Nanjing sample, from which a single factor
(eigenvalue = 2.53) that explained 42.18% of the total vari-
ance was extracted. A scree plot of the eigenvalues also sup-
ported a one-factor interpretation (initial eigenvalues = 2.53,
.89, .86, .76, .49, and .47). The KMO (.76) and Bartlett's test,
2(15) = 282.60, p < .0001, also suggested the adequacy of
the correlation matrix for factor analysis. Table 3 shows the
PCA loadings of the BRS items for the two Chinese under-
graduate samples.
Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to
examine the incremental utility of the BRS in predicting
PHQ scores, while controlling for the effects of the two resil-
ience resources. This was also done to show that the BRS
measured a construct that could not be reduced to the two
resilience resources. The results clearly showed that the BRS
scores were able to explain a significant portion of the vari-
ance in PHQ scores after the effects of gender, age, and the
two resilience resources were controlled for (Table 4).
For the Hong Kong sample,R2 = .054, F(1, 524) = 33.25,
and p < .001. Similar results were found for the Nanjing sam-
ple, R2 = .036, F(1, 237) = 10.06, and p < .005. In the pres-
ent study, the predictive power of the BRS as indexed by the
portion of the explained physical health variance (5.4% and
3.6% in the Hong Kong and Nanjing samples, respectively)
was comparable with that reported in prior studies (Nygren
et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2008).
Gender and age also explained a significant percentage of
the variance in the Hong Kong sample. However, this was
not observed for the Nanjing undergraduates. In particular,
male and younger Hong Kong students tended to score
higher on the PHQ.
Path Models
To test whether the BRS scores or resilience (one's ability to
bounce back) mediated the link between resilience resources
and physical health, the hypothesized path model was tested
separately in the Hong Kong and Nanjing samples using path
analysis (IBMAMOS 19). First, the model depicted in Figure 1
was tested in the Hong Kong sample. Using a maximum like-
lihood estimation, the model fit was determined to be ade-
quate: 2(2) = 4.12, p = .13, comparative fit index (CFI) =
0.996, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) =
0.04 (Figure 2). As hypothesized, both optimism and self-
esteem were positively associated with resilience, which
was, in turn, positively associated with physical health.
These results clearly pointed to an indirect-only mediation
and suggested that resilience or the ability to bounce back
was the most crucial factor translating the two resilience
qualities into better physical health (Zhao, Lynch, & Chen,
2010).
A similar analysis was conducted for the Nanjing data,
using the model delineated in Figure 1. However, an ade-
quate fit was not observed: 2(2) = 11.60, p < .01; CFI =
0.934, RMSEA = 0.13. An inspection of the results summa-
rized in Table 4 indicated that the effect of self-esteem on
physical health in the Nanjing sample was greater than that
in the Hong Kong sample, such that the linear relationship
remained significant in the Nanjing sample after resilience
was entered into the regression equation. The path model for
the Nanjing sample was then revised by adding a path

between self-esteem and physical health. The sample was then
tested again (Figure 3), with an adequate fit resulting: 2(1) =
2.30, p = 1.29, CFI = 0.991, RMSEA = 0.07. The complemen-
tary mediation observed suggested that the relationship
between self-esteem and physical health in the Nanjing sam-
ple might have been more complex than that in the Hong Kong
sample because resilience was not the only mediator of the
relationship (Zhao et al., 2010).

Discussion
The findings of the present study constitute the first set of
data demonstrating the validity of the BRS for Hong Kong
and mainland Chinese undergraduates. The adapted scale
was shown to be a reliable and valid measure for assessing
one's ability to bounce back from stress in two samples of
Chinese undergraduates. The scale items loaded substan-
tially on one single factor, implying that the scale measured
the same construct of resilience in the two samples.
Moreover, consistent with resilience theories, the ability to
bounce back mediated the effect of resilience resources such
as optimism and self-esteem on physical health in the two
samples. These findings have two implications. First, the
availability of the BRS facilitates studies of resilience in
Chinese people. Due to its brevity and ability to mediate the
effect of resilience resources on health, the adapted BRS
should be more suitable for research or screening purposes
than either the Chinese version of CD-RISC (Yu & Zhang,
2007) or a composite of resilience qualities (e.g., Chan et
al., 2006; Lai & Mak, 2009). Second, this study pinpointed
the mechanisms in which resilience resources are translated
into better health outcomes. This has not been reported pre-
viously, and should advance the general understanding of
resilience. In support of the argument that one's ability to
bounce back from stress is conceptually distinct from other
definitions of resilience (Smith et al., 2010), the findings of
this study clearly show that the construct measured by the
BRS, one's ability to bounce back from stress, cannot be
reduced to resilience resources or positive traits. Rather, it is
more appropriately conceived as a separate construct that
mediates the effect of resilience resources on physical
health. Moreover, as this study found one's ability to bounce
back from stress to be more predictive of physical health, it
may be a more important target for interventions than other
positive characteristics.
Resilience research has focused on mental rather than
physical health outcomes, with only a handful of studies
examining both the mental and physical health outcomes of
resilience factors. However, resilience factors have been
shown to explain a smaller percentage of variance in physi-
cal health outcomes than mental health outcomes (e.g., 4.7%
vs. 19.2%, Nygren et al., 2005; 5.2% vs. 14.4%, Smith et al.,
2008). As suggested by Scheier and Carver (1987), the small
effect of resilience resources on physical health could be
attributed to the relatively large number of factors that could
determine self-reports of physical health but might not have
been controlled in most studies. These investigators have
also pointed out that self-reports of physical symptomatol-
ogy may not be perfect measures of the underlying physio-
logical events or symptoms actually experienced. Due to the
small portion of explained variance in physical health
observed in our study, we would never claim that the two
resilience resources and the ability to bounce back from
stress are the sole determinants of physical health, only that
these qualities contribute reliably to the explanation of self-
reports of physical health, as shown clearly by the results of
our study.
Although in the present study the BRS explained only a
small portion of the variance in physical health, this study
makes contributions that compensate for this limitation.
First, it is one of the few studies to extend the health-related
effects of psychological resilience to the physical realm.
Findings have clearly shown that resilience is a crucial vari-
able in explaining the influence of positive psychological
attributes on physical health. Second, it is the first study to
examine the validity of the BRS in Chinese populations.
Although studies have examined the applicability of other
resilience measures to Chinese populations (e.g., Wang, Shi,
Zhang, & Zhang, 2010; Yu & Zhang, 2007), none has criti-
cally evaluated the conceptual basis of psychological resil-
ience, as the present study does.
The difference in the mediating effect of an ability to
bounce back from stress between the Hong Kong and
Nanjing samples is worthy of further discussion. Using the
typology proposed by Zhao et al. (2010), the former is an
instance of "indirect-only mediation," and the latter is a form
of "complementary mediation" (p. 200). This raises the pos-
sibility that the centrality of self-esteem in determining phys-
ical health might have varied between the two samples. This
study's findings contradict recent evidence of the supremacy
of self-esteem in determining physical and mental health in

Hong Kong (Li, Chan, Chung, & Chui, 2010) and mainland
(Ye, Yu, & Li, 2012) Chinese individuals, and suggest that
the health-promoting effects of interventions that focus on
enhancing self-esteem may be greater in mainland under-
graduates than in Hong Kong Chinese undergraduates. For
the latter, the ability to bounce back from stress is the more
appropriate target of intervention.
Despite the significance of this study's findings, a number
of limitations may moderate their effects. First, as only opti-
mism and self-esteem were examined in relation to the BRS
in this study, it is possible that one's ability to bounce back
from stress could have been reduced to other unconsidered
positive constructs. Although no Chinese sample data were
available to evaluate the validity of this conjecture, Smith et
al. (2010) showed that BRS scores remained predictive of
different health outcomes when the effects of a number of
positive characteristics including optimism, social support,
mood clarity, spirituality, and purpose in life were controlled.
To further establish the importance of resilience in research
involving Chinese populations, future studies must include a
wider range of positive characteristics and multiple health
outcome measures. Second, as all of the variables in the pres-
ent study were measured at the same time, the causal rela-
tionships between the positive traits and health outcomes
were not convincingly demonstrated. Third, as the Hong
Kong and Nanjing samples were recruited from a single uni-
versity in each of the two cities, the representativeness of the
two samples might have been limited. Fourth, this study's
exclusive focus on undergraduates makes it difficult to
extend its findings to other age groups or populations with
health problems. To further advance the general understand-
ing of resilience in the Chinese people, future research must
take the aforementioned limitations into account and exam-
ine resilience in relation to a wider range of variables in dif-
ferent populations with a longitudinal design.
