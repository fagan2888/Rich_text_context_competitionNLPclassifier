The authors used data from a nationally representative survey of 933 adults aged 54 years or older (mean
age ¼ 66.2 years; standard deviation, 8.0) in Taiwan to explore whether mortality prediction at older ages is
improved by the use of 3 clusters of biomarkers: 1) standard cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors; 2) markers
of disease progression; and 3) nonclinical (neuroendocrine and immune) markers. They also evaluated the extent
to which these biomarkers account for the female advantage in survival. Estimates from logistic regression models
of the probability of dying between 2000 and 2006 (162 deaths; mean length of follow-up ¼ 5.8 years) showed that
inclusion of each of the 3 sets of markers significantly (P ¼ 0.024, P ¼ 0.002, and P ¼ 0.003, respectively)
improved discriminatory power in comparison with a base model that adjusted for demographic characteristics,
smoking, and baseline health status. The set of disease progression markers and the set of nonclinical markers
each provided more discriminatory power than standard risk factors. Most of the excess male mortality resulted
from the men being more likely than women to smoke, but each of 3 markers related to disease progression or
inflammation (albumin, neutrophils, and interleukin-6) explained more than 10% of excess male mortality.

John Graunt, often considered the father of both demog-
raphy and epidemiology, is renowned for his systematic
analysis of deaths listed in London's ``bills of mortality''
(1). More than 3 centuries later, scholars in both fields are
still engaged in mortality prediction, with demographers
focusing on the influence of social, demographic, and be-
havioral factors and epidemiologists on risk factors for
chronic disease. The recent proliferation of ``biosocial sur-
veys'' that obtain sociodemographic information through
interviews along with biologic markers based on physical
assessments and laboratory analyses (2) provides new op-
portunities for enhancing mortality prediction.
Most population-based studies of all-cause mortality (3­7)
focus on a set of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and
metabolic syndrome that are typically measured in preven-
tive health examinations. More recent population-based
studies have included ``new'' measures, but most focus on
cardiovascular mortality, and many include only a small
number of biologic measures (8­14). Although cardiovascular
disease remains a leading cause of death in many countries,
including Taiwan, an examination of a single set of causes is
unlikely to provide a sufficiently general explanation of over-
all mortality.
In this study, we used data from a national sample of older
adults in Taiwan to integrate biologic and self-reported
measures into models of all-cause mortality over a 6-year
period. Our first goal was to evaluate the links between
mortality and 3 sets of biologic measures: 1) standard risk
factors related to cardiovascular and metabolic function;
2) markers of disease progression; and 3) markers of neu-
roendocrine and immune function. We focused on the extent
to which the latter 2 clusters enhanced mortality prediction.
Our second objective was to provide insight into the sex
difference in mortality at older ages. A vast body of litera-
ture documents the female survival advantage in industrial-
ized nations and a widening of this advantage through most

of the 20th century (15­18). Numerous investigators have also
used cause-of-death data and self-reports of morbidity to ex-
amine the sources of the sex difference (15, 19­21). By con-
trast, few investigators have used biologic measures to identify
the physiologic pathways that underlie excess male mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
The 2000 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging
Study (SEBAS) comprised a nationally representative sam-
ple of persons aged 54 years or older in Taiwan; elderly
persons (ages !71 years) and urban residents were over-
sampled (22). As Figure 1 shows, SEBAS was based on
a random subsample of respondents interviewed during
the 1999 wave of the Taiwan Longitudinal Survey of Aging
(sometimes referred to as the Survey of Health and Living
Status of the Near-Elderly and Elderly in Taiwan). Written
informed consent was obtained for participation in both the
in-home interview and the hospital visit; all protocols were
approved by human subjects committees in Taiwan and at
Georgetown University (Washington, DC) and Princeton
University (Princeton, New Jersey).
On a scheduled day several weeks after a household in-
terview, participants collected a 12-hour overnight urine
sample (7 PM to 7 AM). They fasted overnight and visited
a nearby hospital the following morning, where medical
personnel drew a blood specimen and took blood pressure
and anthropometric measurements. Compliance was ex-
tremely high: 96% of participants fasted overnight and pro-
vided a urine specimen deemed suitable for analysis.
Among the 1,713 respondents selected for SEBAS, 1,497
provided interviews (92% of survivors) and 1,023 under-
went the physical examination (68% of those interviewed).
Of the 474 who were not examined, 111 were not asked to
participate based on exclusion criteria (e.g., serious illness).
Disproportionately high nonparticipation rates were found
among the healthiest and least healthy respondents, with
persons who underwent the medical examination reporting
the same average health status as those who did not. Results
presented elsewhere (23) demonstrate that, in the presence
of controls for age, estimates from the medical examination
portion of SEBAS are unlikely to be seriously biased.
Blood and urine specimens were analyzed at Union Clin-
ical Laboratories in Taipei, Taiwan. In addition to the rou-
tine standardization and calibration tests performed by the
laboratory, 9 persons (outside the target sample) contributed

from the hospitals contracted to participate in the physical examination portion of the study.

triplicate sets of specimens. The results indicated intralabor-
atory reliability of 0.86 or higher for duplicates sent to
Union Clinical Laboratories and interlaboratory correlations
of 0.65 or higher (!0.92 in most cases) between results from
Union Clinical Laboratories and results from the US labo-
ratory Quest Diagnostics (San Juan Capistrano, California).
The original assays of interleukin-6 (Endogen enzyme im-
munoassay; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Illinois) per-
formed in 2000 had a high proportion (32%) of values below
the limit of detection. Here we used measures based on new
assays of the stored frozen specimens conducted in 2007
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems,
Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota); lower detection limit ¼
0.7 pg/mL, interassay coefficient of variation ¼ 12.6%).
Serum creatinine was assayed using the alkaline picrate
method (Beckman CX7 (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton,
California); detection limit ¼ 0.1 mg/dL, coefficient of var-
iation ¼ 3.3%). Serum albumin was assayed using the
bromcresol green method (detection limit ¼ 1.0 g/dL, co-
efficient of variation ¼ 1.5%). Leukocyte (white blood cell)
count was determined by direct current using a Sysmex Cell
Counter SE-9000 (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan; detection
limit ¼ 0.02 3 103 cells/lL, coefficient of variation ¼ 1.5%).
Percentage of neutrophils was calculated from white blood
cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes
(coefficient of variation ¼ 3.3%). Details regarding the
remaining assays are provided elsewhere (22).
Survival status was ascertained through linkage with the
death certificate file maintained by the Taiwan Department
of Health and the household registration file maintained by
the Ministry of the Interior. After exclusion of 1 person with
unknown vital status, those with proxy interviews (n ¼ 17),
and respondents with missing data on covariates (n ¼ 72),
the analysis sample comprised 933 respondents (162 of
whom died by December 31, 2006).
Biomarker selection
The first cluster of biomarkers comprised 6 standard risk
factors related to cardiovascular and metabolic function:
hypertension, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein
cholesterol, body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2),
waist circumference, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Many
population-based studies have established a link between
these risk factors and all-cause mortality (4, 24­27).
The 4 markers in the second group are used to evaluate
and monitor disease. Creatinine clearance is a key indicator
of kidney function. Albumin, the major protein found in
plasma, represents a nonspecific but highly sensitive mea-
sure of disease progression (28). Leukocyte (white blood
cell) count is an indicator of cellular response to inflamma-
tion (29). Neutrophils, the most abundant type of white
blood cell in humans, are generally associated with acute
inflammation. All 4 of these measures have been found to
be associated with mortality in population-based samples
(30­33).
The third group of biomarkers included 4 neuroendocrine
measures--epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and dehy-
droepiandrosterone sulfate--and 2 immune markers--
interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor 1. We refer to
this group as nonclinical because these measures are not
widely used in clinical practice and do not have well-
established cutoffs. Nevertheless, recent population-based
studies have shown that these markers are associated with
mortality (34­38), and a 3-year follow-up in Taiwan sug-
gested that they may be stronger predictors than the standard
risk factors (39).
Biomarker and control variables
Variables based on the 3 groups of biomarkers are shown
in Table 1. Classifications for the standard risk factors were
based on established cutoffs where appropriate (40, 41).
Diastolic and systolic blood pressure were calculated as
the average of 2 seated readings (1 minute apart) taken by
a registered nurse (using a mercury sphygmomanometer on
the right arm) at least 20 minutes after the respondent ar-
rived at the hospital. The classification for body mass index
conformed to the categories used by the Taiwan Department
of Health (42). The cutoffs for waist circumference were
those recommended for Asian populations (43, 44). Glyco-
sylated hemoglobin was parameterized as a continuous vari-
able because reference ranges vary across laboratories (45).
Two dichotomous measures captured data on the use of
antihypertensive and hypoglycemic medications.
Four markers of disease progression were obtained from
the fasting blood sample. Creatinine clearance was esti-
mated from the formula of Cockcroft and Gault (46), which
is based on the level of serum creatinine, taking into account
age, sex, and body weight. Serum albumin, white blood cell
count, and the percentage of white blood cells comprised of
neutrophils were measured as continuous variables.
Because there are no established cutoffs, the nonclinical
measures were also treated as continuous variables. Epi-
nephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol measurements were
obtained from the overnight urine specimen, which pro-
vided integrated values of basal operating levels during a pe-
riod when most participants were resting; values are
reported in micrograms per gram of urinary creatinine to
adjust for body size. Levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sul-
fate, interleukin-6, and insulin-like growth factor 1 were
based on the fasting blood sample.
Sociodemographic control factors included in each model
comprised age, sex, ethnicity (mainlander vs. Taiwanese),
education, and urban residence. We tested a quadratic term
for age to capture possible nonlinear effects; because it was
not significant, we excluded it from the final models. We
also included 6 measures of baseline health status: 1) num-
ber of current health conditions; 2) number of mobility lim-
itations; 3) cognitive function score; 4) Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (47) score; 5) global
self-assessed health; and 6) recent smoking status.
Analytical strategy
In the initial stage of the analysis, we fitted both logistic
regression models of the probability of dying between 2000
and 2006 and Cox proportional hazards models based
on age-specific mortality rates over the 6-year period.
Diagnostic checks indicated that the proportional hazards

ates. Thus, although a hazard model has the advantage that
age can be used as the time scale, there would be no well-
identified procedure for obtaining estimates of biomarker-
specific contributions to excess male mortality in a model

a Descriptive statistics are based on weighted data.
b Current illness was measured by counting the following 12 self-
reported conditions: high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, heart dis-
ease, cancer or malignant tumor, lower respiratory tract disease,
arthritis or rheumatism, gastric ulcer or stomach ailment, liver or gall-
bladder disease, cataracts, kidney disease, gout, and spinal or verte-
bral spurs.
c The measure of mobility limitations counted how many of the
following physical tasks the respondent reported difficulty in perform-
ing without aid: standing continuously for 15 minutes and for 2 hours,
squatting, raising both hands over one's head, grasping or turning
objects with one's fingers, lifting or carrying an object weighing
11­12 kg, running a short distance (20­30 m), walking 200­300 m,
and climbing 2 or 3 flights of stairs.
d The measure of cognitive function counted the number of cogni-
tive tasks completed incorrectly, including basic orientation questions,
a series of 4 subtractions, and immediate memory recall.
e Depressive symptoms were measured by means of a 10-item
short form of the full Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (47), coded according to standard practice based on both the
number and severity of symptoms.
f Global self-assessed health status was based on the following
question: ``Regarding your current state of health, do you feel it is
excellent, good, average, not so good, or poor?''
g Weight (kg)/height (m)2.
h Outliers (i.e., values greater than 5 standard deviations above the
mean) were recoded to that cutpoint (i.e., trimmed). Values were
trimmed for glycosylated hemoglobin (n ¼ 4), white blood cell count
(n ¼ 1), epinephrine (n ¼ 1), norepinephrine (n ¼ 1), cortisol (n ¼ 3),
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (n ¼ 4), interleukin-6 (n ¼ 2), and
insulin-like growth factor 1 (n ¼ 1).
i Creatinine clearance was estimated on the basis of the Cockcroft-
Gault formula (46); outliers (n ¼ 3) for serum creatinine were trimmed
before calculation of this measure.
j Approximately 11% of values on interleukin-6, 20% of values on
epinephrine, and 1% of values on dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
were below assay sensitivity; these cases were assigned a value of 0.

that accounted for nonproportional hazards. Moreover, be-
cause we did not have additional information on biomarkers
within the 6-year period to consider time-varying covariates
and because all respondents were followed for the same time
period, the logistic model did not present serious drawbacks.
Thus, we focused the analysis on estimates derived from
logistic regression, but below we describe the similarity of
results from the 2 approaches.
In order to adjust for the clustered sampling design of the
Taiwan Longitudinal Survey of Aging and SEBAS, we in-
corporated into the logistic regression models a random ef-
fect for the primary sampling units. Model 1 included
sociodemographic variables and measures of baseline health
status that may affect both biomarkers and mortality. Each
of the subsequent 3 models added 1 cluster of biomarkers:
cardiovascular/metabolic markers (model 2), markers of
disease progression (model 3), and nonclinical markers
(model 4). Model 5 included all 3 clusters of biomarkers.
Because previous research has demonstrated that risk is
often associated with both low and high levels of biomarkers
or, more generally, that the associations between some bio-
markers and mortality are nonlinear, we tested quadratic
terms for the continuous biomarkers. We retained the 4 terms
that were statistically significant (P < 0.05, 2-sided): creat-
inine clearance, white blood cell count, epinephrine, and
interleukin-6. To test the robustness of our findings, we
recoded our continuous biomarkers into categories based
on quintiles of the observed distributions and found that
the substantive results were unchanged (results not shown).
We calculated the receiver operating characteristic curve
to evaluate the accuracy of the models in discriminating
between decedents and survivors. The area under the re-
ceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) summarizes
the performance of a model, with higher values indicating
better accuracy. Chi-square tests based on the AUC values
were used to determine whether inclusion of a given set of
markers yielded a significant improvement over the base
model.
Finally, we examined the contribution of each biomarker
in accounting for the sex difference in mortality. Before
determining the model to use for this exercise, we added
interaction terms between each biomarker variable and sex
to models 2­4 to assess whether the effects of the bio-
markers differed by sex. Because the interaction terms were
significant (P < 0.05, 2-sided) for only 2 biomarkers (white
blood cells and interleukin-6)--little more than what we
would expect by chance--we did not include these interac-
tions in the model.
In light of a substantial body of literature that attributes
a large fraction of excess male mortality in industrialized
countries to smoking, we calculated the contribution attrib-
utable to smoking as a benchmark. Thus, our base model for
determining the mortality odds ratio (OR) for males relative
to females (ORbase
) included all of the sociodemographic
and health-status variables shown in model 1 except smok-
ing. Because males have higher mortality than females in
Taiwan, ORbase
exceeds 1 and provides a measure of the
degree of excess male mortality after adjustment for the
control variables. Subsequently, we added a biomarker,
which may have comprised more than 1 variable for bio-
markers that were categorical, had a quadratic term, or in-
cluded an associated variable denoting medication use, to
the base model. The resulting odds ratio for males
(ORw/marker
) was used to calculate the percentage change
in excess male mortality attributable to that biomarker:
% change ¼

3 100:
A negative percent change implied that inclusion of the bio-
marker accounted for some of the excess male mortality,
whereas a positive percent change indicated that inclusion
of the biomarker exaggerated the sex difference. Corre-
sponding calculations were performed for the smoking vari-
able and for the 3 clusters of biomarkers.
To examine the robustness of our findings, we repeated
this analysis including information in the base model on
whether the respondent smoked. Because the effect of
smoking on excess mortality could not be estimated in this
exercise, the estimates of percent change were larger for
almost all of the biomarkers. However, the relative impor-
tance of the biomarkers remained essentially unaltered--for
example, the 3 biomarkers associated with the largest re-
duction in the sex difference were the same regardless of
whether smoking was included in the model. Stata 10.1 was
used for all analyses (Stata Corporation, College Station,
Texas).
RESULTS
Table 2 presents estimated odds ratios for the 5 logistic
models. Among the standard risk factors, only low body
mass index (underweight) was significantly associated with
mortality (P ¼ 0.017, 2-sided). All 4 markers of disease
progression and 3 nonclinical measures (epinephrine,
interleukin-6, and, in model 5, cortisol) were significantly
associated with 6-year mortality.
The receiver operating characteristic curves for models
1­4 are presented in Figure 2. Chi-square tests based on the
AUC values (bottom of Table 2) indicated that inclusion of
each of the 3 sets of markers significantly improved discrim-
inatory power in comparison with the base model (model 2:
P ¼ 0.024; model 3: P ¼ 0.002; model 4: P ¼ 0.003). The
disease progression and nonclinical models (models 3 and
4) had larger AUC values than the standard risk factor model
(model 2). Additional comparisons (not shown) between
the AUC value for model 2 and the AUC values for models
that added the disease progression or nonclinical markers to
model 2 revealed that both sets of markers significantly in-
creased the predictive power of model 2 (P ¼ 0.003 and
P ¼ 0.002, respectively). Comparisons across the models
revealed that only the disease progression variables ac-
counted for a substantial fraction of the increased risk of
dying with age (the odds ratio for age decreased from 1.12 in
model 1 to 1.07 in model 3) or the level of excess male
mortality (the odds ratio for male sex decreased from 1.58
in model 1 to 1.44 in model 3).
We fitted models similar to those in Table 2 using Cox
proportional hazards (results not shown). The Cox models
were stratified to permit different baseline hazards for men

and women, and standard errors were adjusted for clustering
within primary sampling units; in addition, quadratic terms
were included for only those biomarkers with significant
quadratic terms in the Cox models. The 2 sets of estimates
were very similar. For example, the AUC values for each of
the 5 models differed by less than 0.01 between the 2 ap-
proaches. Similarly, for both the logistic models and the Cox
models, the disease progression and nonclinical models
yielded larger improvements over the baseline model than
the standard risk factor model.
Table 3 reveals that an indicator of whether the respondent
had smoked during the past 6 months accounted for more
than half of excess male mortality: The base model implied
that the odds of dying were 2.3 times greater for men than for
women, but ORmale
was reduced to 1.6 (and no longer sig-
nificant) after the model controlled for smoking status. That
is, more than half of excess male mortality resulted from a
higher prevalence of smoking among men than among
women in this sample (41% vs. 2%). Two markers of disease
progression (albumin and neutrophils) and 1 nonclinical
marker (interleukin-6) each explained more than 10% of
the sex difference in mortality, but these reductions were
much more modest than those from smoking.
In contrast, ORmale
increased after adjustment for many
of the standard risk factors and for all of the nonclinical
markers except interleukin-6. Because women are generally
more likely than men to have high risk levels of these
markers, the model predicts that excess male mortality
would be even greater if men and women had the same
average levels of these biomarkers.

survival over a base model that adjusts for demographic
characteristics, smoking, and baseline health status? Sec-
ond, do measurements of these biomarkers shed any light
on differences in mortality between men and women at
older ages?
We found that each of the 3 clusters of biomarkers im-
proved discriminatory power in comparison with the base
model. In addition, after adjustment for the standard risk
factors, the markers of disease progression and the nonclin-
ical markers each significantly improved mortality
prediction.
We also determined that smoking accounted for 55% of
excess male mortality. This estimate is consistent with sev-
eral studies in the United States and Western Europe that
found that, averaged over a broad range of adult ages, the
sex difference in all-cause mortality attributable to smoking
ranged between 40% and 60% (48­50). Although no bio-
marker in our study had such a dramatic effect, 3 markers--
interleukin-6, albumin, and neutrophils--each accounted
for more than 10% of the excess male mortality in our
sample. Thus, measures related to inflammation and the
presence or progression of disease may provide some in-
sight into why males experience higher mortality at these
ages. For example, markers of kidney (creatinine and
albumin) and liver (albumin) function may reflect life-
threatening conditions that are more common among men
than among women.
This study had several advantages over earlier efforts to
enhance mortality prediction in general populations. Fore-
most, SEBAS was based on a nationally representative sam-
ple of older Taiwanese. The survey collected data on an
extensive set of biomarkers, was linked with verified

mortality information for a 6-year follow-up period, and
obtained detailed information about potential confounders.
At the same time, there were several important limitations
of this analysis. Biomarkers were measured on a single oc-
casion--either overnight prior to the medical examination
or during the examination--and may have been affected by
medication use or diet. The reference periods associated
with these markers vary enormously (e.g., glycosylated he-
moglobin reflects the previous several months, whereas in-
terleukin-6 can vary widely within a single day). Moreover,
the restriction of SEBAS to persons aged 54 years or older
may limit the generalizability of these results to younger age
groups. For example, the estimates in Table 2 demonstrated
that low body mass index predicted mortality whereas high
body mass index did not; this finding probably arose be-
cause of the association between disease and weight loss
at older ages and is consistent with other studies of older
adults (51­53). The relations between mortality and other
cardiovascular risk factors--particularly cholesterol and
blood pressure--have been shown to weaken or reverse di-
rection with increasing age (53­55). However, estimates
based on separate analyses of respondents aged 54­69 and
!70 years (not shown) indicated that the standard risk fac-
tors, considered as a group, were equally strong predictors
for both age cohorts in Taiwan.
Another potential shortcoming is that our estimates were
based on the assumption that the effects of the biomarkers
on survival are the same for men and women. This assump-
tion is consistent with findings from 2 large-scale popula-
tion-based studies (13, 53) and leads to a parsimonious
model, but it may understate the contributions associated
with indicators of disease and inflammation. This specula-
tion is based on exploratory analyses which suggested that
both white blood cell count and interleukin-6 have larger
effects on mortality among men than among women and the
fact that the Cockcroft-Gault formula used to estimate cre-
atinine clearance incorporates an implicit sex interaction.
Had we used unadjusted values, serum creatinine would
have accounted for a nontrivial proportion of excess male
mortality. In future studies with sufficient statistical power,
investigators need to reexamine sex-specific associations
between the biomarkers and survival despite the potential
complexity (i.e., the estimated contribution to excess male
mortality would vary by the levels of the biomarkers).
Our findings are consistent with previous research in
2 respects. First, our results suggest that measures beyond
standard risk factors are predictive of survival in generally
healthy populations--a conclusion supported by a growing
body of literature on the association between interleukin-6
and mortality in Western population-based samples (12, 35,
38, 56) and links between overall mortality and 1 or more of
the following markers: epinephrine, creatinine, albumin,
and white blood cell count (10, 13, 37, 53, 57). Second,
our results demonstrate that these biomarkers cannot ac-
count for the observed sex difference in mortality. Although
surprising at first glance, this outcome is in line with a com-
parative study that demonstrated that the female advantage
regarding standard risk factors was smaller in Taiwan than
in the United States and that sex differences in hormonal
markers embodied a substantial female disadvantage in both
countries (58). Fried et al. (53) reached a similar conclusion
regarding the failure of biomarkers to explain excess US
male mortality, despite adjustment for cardiovascular risk
factors, measures of clinical and subclinical disease, and
functional and cognitive impairments.
These results suggest that we and other researchers may
be missing critical physiologic systems or pathways that
underlie excess male mortality. Alternatively, the sex differ-
ence in survival may operate through huge numbers of po-
tentially unobservable or unmeasurable physiologic effects.
Our results underscore the importance not only of including
an expansive set of biologic measures in survival models but
also of examining the ``social pathways'' through which
biologic effects may operate differently for men and
women, such as risk-taking behaviors (other than smoking),
utilization of health services, and compliance with medical
protocols.
Whether the additional explanatory power of any set of
biomarkers is substantively important lies not in any statis-
tical analysis or test but in the eye of the beholder. For
example, if the standard risk factor model is viewed as an
improvement over a demographic model of mortality, then
we need to recognize that the nonclinical and disease pro-
gression biomarkers provide enhancements in prediction
that are at least as notable. Some researchers have argued
that selected ``new biomarkers'' yield only a minor im-
provement in all-cause mortality prediction (13) and that
the estimated cost of measurement does not justify their
use as a general screening tool (59), whereas others have
reported that such biomarkers substantially improve mortal-
ity prediction (14). In the present study, we found that the set
of disease progression markers and the cluster of markers
reflecting neuroendocrine and immune function each 1) sig-
nificantly improved mortality prediction over a model that
included standard risk factors and 2) provided more discrim-
inatory power than the standard risk factors. From a theoret-
ical perspective, the inflammation and disease progression
markers provide a foothold for understanding the sources of
sex differentials in mortality in industrialized countries, as
well as increases in mortality risk with age. On the other
hand, from a practical perspective, we recognize that some
of these measures may not be causally linked to survival,
that we lack information on preventive interventions based
on these markers, and that potential interventions may not
be cost-effective.
