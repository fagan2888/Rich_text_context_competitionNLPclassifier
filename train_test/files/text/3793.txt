Consumer Neoteny: An Evolutionary
Perspective on Childlike Behavior
in Consumer Society
Mathieu Alemany Oliver1
Abstract
This research explores childlike consumer behavior from an evolutionary perspective. More specifically, it uses the concept of
neoteny to show that the retention of ancestors' juvenile characteristics is related to specific behaviors. The results of factor
analyses conducted on a UK sample (n ¼ 499) and a French sample (n ¼ 292) 7 years later indicate four dimensions of childlike
consumer behavior, namely, stimulus seeking, reality conflict, escapism, and control of aggression.

According to Barber (2007), a childlike feeling of rejuvenation
permeates the consumer society, which has entered an infanti-
list ethos. In search of sensations, adults can take risks and put
the reality principle to one side. In the quest for enchantment,
they visit theme parks and act ``as if.'' Fun becomes an impera-
tive (Wolfenstein, 1951): Consumers of all ages play games on
their mobile phones while waiting for the bus or show extraor-
dinary excitement about a future purchase. They cook or buy
colorful cupcakes or cake lollipops for their guests, perform air
guitar at a Dodgers baseball game, and run not only to improve
their health but to flee from zombies. Meanwhile, brands such
as McDonald's (Australia), Volkswagen (France), Haribo
(France), Ford (United States), Mercedes (Hagerstown, MD),
Beef `O' Brady's (United States), San Francisco Giants, Audi
(United States), Kia (United States), and Evian (worldwide) are
using their commercials to ask their consumers to let out their
inner child.
To what extent is this infantilist ethos tied to evolutionary
processes? As yet, marketing and communication researchers
have not displayed a deep interest in the evolutionary causes
of consumer behavior, although there have been a few excep-
tions (e.g., Griskevicius, Shiota, & Nowlis, 2010; Hantula,
2003; Hudders, De Backer, Fisher, & Vyncke, 2014; Saad,
2007; Saad & Gill, 2000; Vincke, 2016). However, it is pos-
sible to provide a clearer understanding of a consumption
phenomenon such as childlike behavior by accepting the
assumption that individual variation in behavioral disposi-
tions can be considered from an evolutionary perspective
(Buss, 2009; Nettle, 2005).
This article explores the phenomenon of childlike con-
sumer behavior from an evolutionary perspective. In this con-
text, childlike consumer behavior refers to the juvenile
characteristics that adult consumers present. It is partly under-
stood as a result of paedomorphosis, which is the retention of
ancestors' juvenile characteristics into adulthood. Since
Gould (1977), it has been accepted that neoteny, that is a
retardation of somatic development, explains most of the pae-
domorphic aspects in humans.
After sharing the relevant literature on neoteny and the
methodology used in this research (scale development
through factor analyses), we present and discuss four
dimensions of childlike consumer behavior based on evolu-
tionary theories.

Neoteny
Biological Neoteny Induces Behavioral Neoteny
Neoteny (literally ``to stretch youth''; Kollmann, 1885) is a
``paedomorphosis produced by retardation of somatic develop-
ment'' (Gould, 1977, p. 483). It is a developmental process that
occurs more slowly than was the case in the subject's ancestors
and causes the retention of juvenile traits in the descendants'
adulthood. Paedomorphosis is part of a larger phenomenon
called heterochrony. Heterochrony is defined as a change in
the rate or timing of development, which leads to a modifica-
tion of size and/or shape but also behavior (McKinney, 1999).
For instance, Roth, Nishikawa, Naujoks-Manteuffel, Schmidt,
and Wake (1993) show how paedomorphic processes in sala-
manders have modified the nervous system. The Dutch anato-
mist Bolk (1926) made the first detailed study of the
similarities between the anatomy of the Homo sapiens and that
of young and unborn great apes. But Bolk's theory and the
racist and sexist overtone of his writings made the concept of
neoteny more difficult to accept within the research commu-
nity. While trying to ``rescue Bolk's data,'' Gould (1977,
p. 356) underlines a number of paedomorphic--mostly neote-
nous--features that were critical to human evolution. For
example, the neotenous human skull (i.e., with reference to
chimpanzees, a retardation in shape and an increase in size and
in the duration of growth) contributed to brain plasticity, lan-
guage, and culture. Another example is found in the shape of
the pelvis, which permitted an upright stance and bipedalism.
While the main debate around neoteny concerns its central
role in human evolution, it is commonly accepted that neoteny
played a decisive role and that some other types of hetero-
chrony were also critical (Bogin, 1988; Bromage, 1987; Eccles,
1979; Løvtrup, 1978; McKinney & McNamara, 1991; Shea,
1989). Today, the evidence of human neoteny tends to be out-
lined in neurological structures and processes as well as human
genetics. For example, the ancestral SRGAP2, a gene that is
highly expressed during brain development and controls corti-
cal neuron migration, triggers neoteny by delaying dendritic
spine maturation (Charrier et al., 2012). More generally, neo-
teny plays a functional role in the maturation of the prefrontal
cortex and in the acquisition of high cognitive abilities and
emotional capacities (Petanjek et al., 2011; Somel et al., 2009).
Following McKinney's (1999) definition of heterochrony,
an accepted corollary of the process of neoteny is that the
observed retardation of somatic development results in the
retention of juvenile traits of behavior. In other words, biolo-
gical neoteny induces behavioral neoteny (Bjorklund, 1997;
Cairns, Gariepy, & Hood, 1990; Gottlieb, 1992). For example,
canine animals and longhorn sheep display different behavioral
systems corresponding to different juvenile ancestral behaviors
caused by biological neoteny (Coppinger et al., 1987; Geist,
1971). Mason (1968) and Cairns (1976) suggest that attach-
ment, with respect to humans, is partly due to neoteny, and
Lorenz (1971) underlines the importance of these juvenile
characteristics in the maintenance of brain plasticity. Finally,
Cairns (1976) points out that neoteny partly explains both the
instability of individual differences and the malleability of
behaviors during childhood and more largely in every social
mammal's offspring.
Neoteny and Marketing
In marketing research, the concept of neoteny is rarely used and
most often deals with anthropomorphic products. Anthropo-
morphism can be the attribution of a humanlike mind or of
humanlike physical features to nonhumans (Waytz, Cacioppo,
& Epley, 2010). Anthropomorphic products can be found in
very different product categories and brands: products for the
home such as Koziol items or the Honda Asimo domestic
robot; cars such as the Volkswagen New Beetle (Aggarwal &
McGill, 2007); or perfumes, soap, and beverages using
hourglass-shaped bottles (e.g., Jean Paul Gaultier, Ivory, or
Coca-Cola, respectively). Anthropomorphism is also found in
brand communication with half of Ad Age's top 10 advertising
icons of the 20th century being anthropomorphic characters
(Brown, 2010). Brown (2010, p. 219) considers neoteny a com-
monplace feature for anthropomorphic brand characters and
puts forward the tendency for some to ``get younger, more
cherubic, more cuddly, more childlike, more and more cute
with the passing years.''
The promotion of neotenous products and brand characters
might be explained by the likeliness that consumers will
develop affective responses and positive attitudes toward child-
like anthropomorphic characteristics (Hell´
en & Sa
¨a
¨ksja
¨rvi,
2013; Miesler, Leder, & Herrmann, 2011). For instance,
anthropomorphic car design improves the self-driving car
experience by increasing individuals' trust in the autonomous
car's performance (Waytz, Heafner, & Epley, 2014). Similarly,
neotenous characteristics in cars such as round and big ``eyes''
with a high and smooth forehead can signal that there is no
threat (e.g., the Volkswagen New Beetle; Woodside, 2010),
just like it tells consumers they can develop a playful relation-
ship with the product.
When it comes to consumer research, no study actually
evaluates the role of neoteny in consumer behavior. However,
evolutionary studies can give consumer researchers a few poin-
ters. For instance, neoteny is a component of physical attrac-
tiveness, especially in women (Cunningham, Roberts, Barbee,
Druen, & Wu, 1995; Elia, 2013; Jones et al., 1995). Jones
(1996) suggests that a preference for women with light skin
and fair hair is due not only to political and cultural dominance
but also to a preference for neotenous women who already
existed in ancient Rome, along with women using cosmetics
to lighten their skins. Her studies reveal that only in a few
societies (including in non-Westernized populations) are neo-
tenous traits not attractive. As for waist-to-hip ratio (Singh,
1993), neotenous features such as light and smooth skin, large
eyes, a small nose, and full lips are indicators of good health
and reproductive potential in mate selection; they also repre-
sent desirable qualities highlighted by Western consumer

society, such as youth, vivaciousness, openness, and agreeable-
ness (Berry & McArthur, 1985; Rhodes, 2006). Magazines
such as Glamour and Cosmopolitan were found to showcase
such neotenous features (Jones, 1996).
One possible consequence of the preference for neotenous
features and the presence of neotenous subjects in media might
be consumers' willingness to transform into ultra-neotenous
species by imitating the aesthetic standards (e.g., neotenous
physical traits) conveyed by the media and to adopt childlike
behavior by immersing themselves in discourses of eternal
youth. This is visible, for example, in the quest for rejuvenes-
cence through the consumption of clothes, cosmetics, Botox,
collagen and plastic surgery, and also in the prevalence of
coolness and cuteness in popular culture (Belk, Tian, & Paa-
vola, 2010; Cross, 2004; Granot, Alejandro, & Russell, 2014).
As illustrated by the Japanese neotenous character Prince
Pickles, the official mascot of the Japan Self-Defense Forces,
cuteness is highly visible in Japan society at the moment. Cute
characters also penetrated Western popular cultures and are
displayed as bipedal mammalian with childlike characteristics:
They have a rounded, nonsexual, and infantile shape, and they
are adorable, gentle, innocent, delicate, and inexperienced
(Jackson, 2009; Yano, 2009). Gould's (1980) Biological
Homage to Mickey Mouse is another good example of the
neotenous process taking place in consumer societies.
Method
This exploratory study aims to introduce the neotenous char-
acteristics of childlike consumer behavior. Below we present
the participants, materials, and procedures employed in this
research.
Participants
British data were collected in 2007 by the Toluna online panel,
an independent survey technology provider, on behalf of an
international research consultancy. The authors collected the
French data in 2014 through a direct online invitation to fill in
the translated questionnaire. Participants were considered as
consumers from the moment they answered items1 related to
consumption. In total, 499 British consumers (representative
online panel with 267 males, 232 females; mean age ¼
41.66, SD ¼ 14.21) and 292 French consumers (158 males,
134 females; mean age ¼ 40.21, SD ¼ 13.51) make up the two
respective samples.
Among the British participants, 9.6% are located in Scot-
land, 2% in Northern Ireland, 5.2% in Wales, and 83.2% in
England. With regard to their social grade classification,2
26.8% have higher and intermediate managerial, administra-
tive, professional occupations (i.e., Grades A and B); 26.9%
have supervisory, clerical and junior managerial, administra-
tive, professional occupations (i.e., Grade C1); 22.4% have
skilled manual occupations (i.e., Grade C2); and 23.9% have
semiskilled or unskilled manual occupations, casual occupa-
tions, or are unemployed or pensioners (i.e., Grades D and
E). Finally, 42.7% of British participants are married, 36.2%
are not engaged in a love relationship, and 60.7% have at least
one child.
Among the French participants, 38.7% live in the country's
three largest cities. Concerning socioprofessional groups,3
0.7% of participants are farmers; 8.6% are craft workers, retai-
lers, or business owners; 21.9% are chief executives, managers,
or have higher grade intellectual occupations; 16.1% have
intermediate occupations; 27.1% are white-collar workers;
10.3% are blue-collar workers; and 15.3% are retired, students,
or unemployed. Finally, 70.2% are married or live with a sig-
nificant other, and 65.4% have at least one child.
Materials and Procedures
Following the widely used Churchill (1979) paradigm and the
work of Gerbing and Anderson (1988), a reduced set of 55
items to be used in factor analysis was identified from a set
of 109 items. The items are based on neoteny, child cognition,
and more generally psychology literature, and they cover the
following six neoteny-related characteristics: play (P. G. Bate-
son, 1976; Bekoff, 1972; Bjorklund, 1997; Bjorklund & Pelle-
grini, 2000; Dansky, 1980; Fagen, 1981; Klinger, 1969;
Lorenz, 1971; Pellegrini & Bjorklund, 2004; Pellegrini &
Smith, 1998; Piaget, 1945/1999; Vygotsky, 1930/2004,
1931/1991, 1933/1967), attachment (Bowlby, 1969/1982;
Cairns, 1976; Fraley, Brumbaugh, & Marks, 2005; Fraley &
Shaver, 2000; Hazan & Shaver, 1987, 1990; Insel, 2000),
regression (Fischer, 1987; Lindahl, Heimann, & Ullstadius,
2003; Plooij & van de Rijt-Plooij, 1989; van de Rijt-Plooij &
Plooij, 1992), egocentrism (Arnett, 1992; Arnett & Balle-
Jensen, 1993; Bjorklund, Gaultney, & Green, 1993; Buss,
1997; Chandler & Greenspan, 1972; Elkind, 1967, 1978;
Gnepp, 1983; Greene, Krcmar, Walters, Rubin, & Hale,
2000; Harter & Pike, 1984; Looft, 1972; Piaget, 1927/1997;
Rothenberg, 1970; Stipek, 1984), decision-making (Furby &
Beyth-Marom, 1992; Lewis, 1981; Miller & Byrnes, 1997;
Steinberg, 2005), and aggressiveness (Crick & Dodge, 1994;
Evans & Short, 1991; Keltikangas-Ja
¨rvinen, 2001; Mize &
Cox, 1990; Slaby & Guerra, 1988).
The 2007 questionnaire took an average time of 20 min to
complete. The first section of the questionnaire dealt with
demographic and socioeconomic questions (e.g., gender, age,
social grade, income, place of residence, and chief income
earner in the household). The second section displayed the 55
items about consumer neoteny that were retained. Items were
measured on 5-point Likert-type scales, 1 being disagree
strongly and 5 being agree strongly. A third section, for the
exclusive use of the research consultancy and not used in the
present research, dealt with consumption habits and behaviors.
The 2014 questionnaire took an average time of 8 min to
complete. The second section of the 2007 questionnaire was
translated through the back-translation method as detailed by
Brislin (1970) and put online for French consumers. A prelim-
inary section was created for demographic and socioeconomic
data. French items were measured with 11-point Likert-type
Alemany Oliver 3
scales, 1 being disagree strongly and 11 being agree strongly,
and took the form of moving cursors initially placed on scale
point 6. The number of points was decided with the aim to get
smoother distributions with greater variation (Dawes, 2002).
Also, for future research, 11-point Likert-type scales proved
to be valid and reliable in cross-cultural studies (Scherpenzeel
& Saris, 1997). Participants had a chance to win gift cards if
they completed the questionnaire. The university ethics com-
mittee approved this research. All respondents were informed
of the general aims, their anonymity was guaranteed, and all
gave full consent.
Replication procedures for further comparisons of results
were adopted. As Asendorpf et al. (2013, p. 108) remind
researchers, ``the replicability of research findings in psychol-
ogy [ . . . ] has been increasingly questioned.'' In the context of
this research, replicability is even more critical because the
findings deal with evolutionary processes. As a result, they
should be compared across several generations to observe
changes in childlike consumer behavior. For this reason,4 the
UK sample was randomly split in half to conduct internal
replication analysis consisting of running an exploratory factor
analysis (EFA) on each split sample (Osborne & Fitzpatrick,
2012). As a result, we worked on one sample of 249 (125
males, 124 females; mean age ¼ 41.53, SD ¼ 14.47) and
another sample of 250 (142 males, 108 females; mean age ¼
41.79, SD ¼ 13.97).
External replicability was tested by collecting new data 7
years later in France. The first reason for collecting new data at
a different time and place is that cultural differences between
the UK and France may have consequences for the four dimen-
sions of childlike consumer behavior and the external replica-
tion of the results. As shown in Figure 1, these two countries
differ with respect to the six dimensions of national culture
(Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov, 2010). Moreover, dimensions
such as uncertainty avoidance may be related to childlike con-
sumer dimensions such as stimulus seeking. The other reason is
that consumers in 2007 (first sample) were not affected by the
global financial crisis yet, while 2014 consumers (second sam-
ple) have possibly experienced a decline in their savings, as
well as job uncertainty, increased risk aversion or lower dispo-
sable income. Since it has been shown that consumers change
their behavior after an economic recession (e.g., Kamakura &
Du, 2012), it was critical to replicate the analysis and see
whether the four dimensions remained stable.
Results
EFA
An EFA using the maximum likelihood method of extraction
and oblique rotation (promax) was conducted in the UK's ran-
domly split sample (n ¼ 249; 125 males, 124 females; mean
age ¼ 41.53, SD ¼ 14.47). The choice of extraction and rota-
tion methods was based on the assumption of dependence
between factors.
Four factors and 17 items were retained, and they explain
71% of total variance. The four factors are escapism, reality
conflict, stimulus seeking, and control of aggression. The num-
ber of factors was determined by the Guttman­Kaiser criterion
(four factors were suggested), Cattell's scree test (four factors
were suggested), Velicer's map (four factors were suggested),
Horn's parallel analysis (five factors were suggested), and
finally their interpretability.
The correlation matrix did not reveal a multicollinearity
issue, the Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO) measures of sampling
adequacy were higher than 0.8 (KMO ¼ .824), Bartlett's test of
sphericity was significant, w2(136) ¼ 2,226.33; p < .00, and the
KMO values for each variable (i.e., elements on the diagonal of
antiimage correlation matrix) were all greater than .74. Com-
munalities are presented in Table 1. Finally, reliability was
measured with Cronbach's a, Jo
¨reskog's r, and item-to-total
correlations. Discriminant validity was assessed with the factor
correlation matrix.
Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs)
In order to test the factor structure's quality of representation,
we conducted a first CFA with the second UK split sample (n ¼
250; 142 males, 108 females; mean age ¼ 41.79, SD ¼ 13.97).
Power estimates show an acceptable sample size for CFA (min-
imum n required for power  .80 ¼ 165; Kim, 2005; MacCal-
lum, Browne, & Sugawara, 1996). With four factors and
between 3 and 5 items per factor, the sample size is also accep-
table according to Wolf, Harrington, Clark, and Miller (2013).
Common method bias was controlled using Harman's single
factor test and the latent common methods variance factor
(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). The results
of Harman's test indicate that a single factor cannot explain the
majority of variance (only 20.5% of variance explained). Addi-
tionally, we observed very little change after adding a latent
factor in the CFA model and comparing the standardized
regression weights from this model with the original model's
standardized regression weights.
The measures reveal a good fit for the four-factor model,
w2(113) ¼ 188.71, p < .00; w2/df ¼ 1.67; adjusted goodness-of-
fit index (AGFI) ¼ .89; comparative fit index (CFI) ¼ .97;

square residual (SRMR) ¼ .052; root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) ¼ .052 (Iacobucci, 2010). Discrimi-
nant validity and convergent validity were both accepted (For-
nell & Larcker, 1981).
For external replicability matters developed in the previous
section, the factor structure's quality of representation was
assessed in another context (France) and at a different time
(7 years later, in 2014). A second CFA was carried out on the
French sample (n ¼ 292; 158 males, 134 females; mean age ¼
40.21, SD ¼ 13.51). The measures confirm a good fit for the
four-factor model, w2(113) ¼ 272.65, p < .00; w2/df ¼ 2.41;
AGFI ¼ .87; CFI ¼ .95; TLI ¼ .94; SRMR ¼ .060; RMSEA ¼

reality conflict (a ¼ .87), escapism (a ¼ .83), and control of
aggression (a ¼ .88). The scale is reliable and valid across
Western European cultural contexts (United Kingdom
and France).
The stimulus-seeking dimension involves the tendency to
seek stimulation in a variety of ways and to respond to exciting
situations in a positive way. It relates to confidence in oneself,
life, and people, and it is very close to Mehrabian and Russell's
(1974) ``need for arousal'' dimension. The reality conflict
dimension captures the struggle that consumers have with the
complexities and responsibilities of adult reality. The escapism
dimension underlines the rich inner life of consumers who may
need to retire from reality but also adapt to it. Finally, the
control of aggression dimension represents consumers' lack
of aggressive control due to difficulties in managing events,
issues, and (more generally) every situation that involves
decision-making skills.
General Discussion
The main objective of this research was to provide a deeper
understanding of neoteny in the context of consumer society.
We have proposed that paedomorphosis, which is the retention
of ancestors' juvenile characteristics into adult consumers, can
explain childlike consumer behavior in part. Among paedo-
morphic processes, we focused on neoteny, which is a retarda-
tion of somatic development. Our findings show that stimulus
seeking (or the need for arousal), reality conflict, escapism, and
control of aggression are four dimensions of consumer beha-
vior that are theoretically partly explained by neoteny. For this
reason, these four dimensions represent childlike consumer
behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the
first empirical work in marketing research to tie paedomorpho-
sis--and more precisely, neoteny--to consumer psychology
and childlike behavior.
Limitations
A first limitation is the low but still acceptable reliability of
composite score (Jo
¨reskog's r ¼ 0.70) of the escapism dimen-
sion. A possible reason is that the escapism dimension is too
broad a spectrum to be grasped in its entirety. For instance,
escapism is linked to imagination, but imagination can be
related to fantasy, creativity, intellect, or complexity (Hofstee,
de Raad, & Goldberg, 1992). It is also highly related to the
broad concept of play, which remains one of the most difficult
concepts to define (Klinger, 1969; Lieberman, 1977; Sutton-
Smith, 1997).
A second limitation concerns our inability to compare these
findings across time and with non-Western European places.
Because paedomorphosis is the retention of ancestors' juvenile
characteristics into adulthood, several studies should be con-
ducted in the future to draw comparisons with the present find-
ings. Moreover, these findings should be compared with
populations from non-Western European cultures. Culture can
be considered a mediator or moderator variable (Cu´
ellar, 2000)
that can reveal different items or even different childlike
dimensions. For instance, Confucianism and Buddhism still
shape Japanese culture and, as a collectivistic society, Japan
emphasizes social harmony and interdependence. These cul-
tural characteristics can have consequences on emotion reg-
ulation (Matsumoto, 2006) and may impact not only the
scores obtained by consumers on the four dimensions of child-
like consumer behavior but also the dimensions themselves.
For example, decision-making, which is related to the reality
conflict and control of aggression dimensions, is also related
to emotion regulation (Heilman, Cris
¸an, Houser, Miclea, &
Miu, 2010).
A third limitation is the lack of empirical evidence showing
the relationship between the present findings and those of
Hell´
en and Sa
¨a
¨ksja
¨rvi (2013). More particularly, consumer
neoteny could explain the positive attitude that neotenous prod-
ucts trigger. For example, needs for attachment and safety dur-
ing periods of regression could lead to a preference for
anthropomorphic and neotenous products and brands. Similarly
to brand love, which can create feelings of confidence (Batra,
Ahuvia, & Bagozzi, 2012; Fournier, 1998), neotenous brands
and products would be able to recreate a safe environment in
which adult consumers can live out their unstable life moments
and reality conflicts more easily.
Childlike Consumer Behavior and Intelligence
A critical discussion topic relates to the potential role that
intelligence--defined in this article as the ability to achieve
goals and adapt to different and changing environments (Legg
& Hutter, 2007)--might have on the four dimensions of child-
like consumer behavior highlighted among the samples. Neo-
tenous processes are partly responsible for the extended
development of the human brain that allows individuals to
continue learning and accounts for human high intelligence
(Gibson, 1991). One reason for such cognitive abilities might
be found in the frontal lobe, which benefits from the extended
development of the human brain and contributes to intelligence
by providing executive functions, for example (Bunge, Dudu-
kovic, Thomason, Vaidya, & Gabrieli, 2002; Duncan, 1995;
Duncan, Emslie, Williams, Johnson, & Freer, 1996). The fron-
tal lobe is able to enhance working memory, help individuals to
regulate aggression, and allow mental flexibility, abstract
thinking, and the capacity to keep related pieces of information
in their minds for task analysis (Duncan, 2005; Miyake et al.,
2000; Obonsawin et al., 2002).
In the context of this research, the four dimensions of child-
like consumer behavior might be related to the frontal lobe and
intelligence by reflecting different adaptive and maladaptive
behaviors. Our findings reveal that two dimensions, namely,
stimulus seeking and escapism, relate directly to play. Play is
an adaptive, experiential function (Bateson & Martin, 2013)
and a critical element in cognitive development (Bjorklund,
1997) that can partly explain an increase in the amount of
synaptic pruning that shapes the neural network (McShea &
Hordijk, 2013). Therefore, stimulus seeking and escapism
6 Evolutionary Psychology
might be interpreted as motivational processes of personal and
creative environment modification that are mainly made pos-
sible through play and can be partly explained by intelligence
and the extended development of the frontal lobe.
Concerning the reality conflict and control of aggression
dimensions, they are both linked to decision-making.
Decision-making is related to adaptive behavior (Keith, Fehr-
mann, Harrison, & Pottebaum, 1987; Payne, Bettman, & John-
son, 1988). Following the somatic marker hypothesis
(Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1991), the reality conflict and
control of aggression dimensions might be explained by an
immature frontal lobe that would produce low capacities in
decision-making and qualitatively poor, ineffective and aggres-
sive solutions to a problem (Crick & Dodge, 1994; Evans &
Short, 1991; Keltikangas-Ja
¨rvinen, 2001; Mize & Cox, 1990;
Slaby & Guerra, 1988). Therefore, one may say that the reality
conflict and control of aggression dimensions would reflect the
inability of consumers to engage in a process of personal and
creative environment modification partly due to an immature
frontal lobe that makes exploration, exploitation, and adjust-
ment more difficult (Cohen, McClure, & Yu, 2007).
In conclusion, findings suggest that childlike consumer
behavior might be related to the frontal lobe and intelligence
by reflecting different adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.
However, the four dimensions seem to use different types of
intelligence--mainly a cognitive and an emotional one. While
the stimulus-seeking and escapism dimensions would be more
related to cognitive intelligence (e.g., stimulus seekers are the
creators of an enriched environment that triggers cognitive
stimulation; Raine, Reynolds, Venables, & Mednick, 2002),
the reality conflict and control of aggression dimensions would
reflect poor decision-making skills that can be explained by
lower levels of emotional intelligence (Bar-On, Tranel, Den-
burg, & Bechara, 2003). In this context, further research should
investigate how adaptive behaviors in childlike consumption
contexts can vary according to the levels of cognitive intelli-
gence and emotional intelligence.
Managerial Implications
Findings should help managers to segment their consumers
around the four dimensions of childlike consumer behavior and
to develop new positioning strategies. Brands can exploit these
four dimensions to communicate with a new language and can
adapt their customer relationship management (CRM) pro-
grams according to their target market. For instance, if the
target market is made up of stimulus seekers, then the relation-
ship between the brand and the consumer should be based on
``best friendship'' (Fournier, 1998). By contrast, if the target
market mainly comprises consumers who score high on the
reality conflict dimension, then the relationship should be
based on ``dependency'' (Fournier, 1998).
Another way to exploit the four dimensions of childlike
consumer behavior in CRM is by differentiating between
scores related to cognitive intelligence and those related to
emotional intelligence. While it has not been widely discussed
in marketing, emotional intelligence plays a critical role in the
buying process and consumption experience. For instance,
salespeople with high emotional intelligence can develop lon-
ger relationships with customers and increase sales revenue
(Kidwell, Hardesty, Murtha, & Sheng, 2011). From the con-
sumer experience standpoint, we suggest that managers relate
the dimensions of their brand personality to the type of
intelligence the brand reflects and use the four dimensions
of childlike behavior to trigger cognitive or emotional stimula-
tion accordingly.
Finally, it is critical that managers develop playful products
and services and differentiate between the types of play. For
instance, consumers engage in play whether they score high on
escapism or stimulus seeking. However, play used for escapism
is an imaginative play that one does not find in the stimulus-
seeking dimension. This differentiation is visible, for example,
in Las Vegas hotels that offer not only imaginative play but
also attractions and contests. The focus on play makes even
more sense in advanced industrial societies for two reasons.
First, disposable income increases and allows more leisure
activities for consumers (Engel's law). Second, social adult-
hood is postponed at later ages (Arnett, 2000), while the con-
sumption of sugar, fat, and endocrine disrupting chemicals
provoke progenesis (i.e., the retention of juvenile traits through
an acceleration of sexual maturation; Aksglaede, Sørensen,
Petersen, Skakkebæk, & Juul, 2009; Biro et al., 2013; Euling
et al., 2008; Louis et al., 2008). These two phenomena might
lead consumers to accentuate childlike behavior since they
become more juvenile, biologically speaking, while simulta-
neously living in societies that postpone entry into adulthood.
In the leisure sector, increasing playfulness should give rise to
new opportunities in specific markets. A good example is the
increasing success of film tourism that allows consumers to
escape mundane environments and adopt a childlike behavior
through regression (Crompton, 1979; Macionis & Sparks,
2009). Utilitarian products should become more and more
playful, too, in particular thanks to the digital turn and the
Internet of Things that transforms any product into an inter-
active and ludic object (e.g., smart or connected refrigerator,
doors, toothbrush . . . ).
