Introduction
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a member of
the renin­angiotensin system (RAS) that degrades angio-
tensin (Ang) II to the seven-amino acid peptide fragment
Ang-(1-7).1,2 ACE2 is thought to function as a negative
regulator of the RAS by degrading Ang II and producing
Ang-(1-7) to counterbalance theAng II-forming activity of
ACE. Although ACE2 is reported to localize in renal glo-
meruli and tubules,3­6 the differences in ACE2 expression
within the kidney seem to be not only tissue-specific but
also cell-specific.6­9 Glomerular expression of ACE2 is
reduced in diabetic mice,6 and reduced ACE2 gene and
protein expression has been confirmed in renal biopsies of
patients with type 2 diabetes.7 On the other hand, at the
tubular level, increased ACE2 activity and protein expres-
sion have been found in diabetic mice.8,9 The renal RAS,
specifically Ang II, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis
of diabetic nephropathy.10 Ang II and ACE are activated in
type 2 diabetes11 and are involved in the development of
microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabe-
tes such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular
disease.12 ACE 2 plays an integral role in protecting against

Abstract
Introduction: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a member of the renin­angiotensin system that degrades
angiotensin (Ang) II to the seven-amino acid peptide fragment Ang-(1-7). We evaluated the changes in urinary ACE2
levels in response to treatment with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker olmesartan in diabetes patients with
nephropathy.
Materials and methods: This prospective, open-label, interventional study was conducted with 31 type 2 diabetes
patients with nephropathy. After initial evaluation, patients received 20 mg/day olmesartan, which was increased to 40
mg/day over a 24-week period.
Results: In diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease, olmesartan significantly increased urinary ACE2 levels
independently of blood pressure and plasma aldosterone levels and reduced albuminuria, urinary liver-type fatty acid
binding protein (L-FABP), and plasma aldosterone levels. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that the change in
urinary L-FABP levels was an independent predictor of increased urinary ACE2 levels.
Conclusion: Olmesartan may have the unique effect of increasing urinary ACE2 levels. However, whether this
contributes to olmesartan's renoprotective effect must be examined further.

renal damage and cardiovascular disease.8,13 It was reported
that deletion of ACE2 leads to the development of Ang
II-dependent renal damage, suggesting ACE2 as a renopro-
tective target in diabetes.14 ACE2 is a homologue of ACE
but is not blocked byACE inhibitors. However, there are no
clinical data showing whether Ang II type 1 receptor block-
ers (ARB) increase ACE2 activity. In this study, we evalu-
ated the changes in urinary ACE2 levels resulting from
ARB treatment in diabetes patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD).
Research design and methods
This prospective, open-label, interventional study was
conducted with 31 outpatients after obtaining written
informed consent and with the approval of the local eth-
ics committee. The study was performed in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Enrollment criteria
were as follows: 1) type 2 diabetes with nephropathy
under stable glycemic control, defined as a hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) level <8.0% after administration of oral
antidiabetic agents, insulin injection therapy, or diet ther-
apy alone for 8 consecutive weeks; 2) albuminuria: uri-
nary albumin/creatinine (Cr) ratio >30 mg/g (average of
two consecutive measurements recorded during the
8-week pre-treatment period); 3) estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) of 30­89 mL/min/1.73 m2; and 4)
hypertension: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP)
130/80 mmHg treated with a fixed dose of antihyperten-
sive agents other than RAS inhibitors for at least 8 weeks
before the study. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1)
age <20 years or >80 years; 2) more than second-degree
hypertension (BP >160/100 mmHg)15; 3) eGFR 90
mL/min/1.73 m2 or <30 mL/min/1.73 m2; 4) severe
heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke
occurring within 6 months before the trial; and 5) previ-
ous treatment with ARB for at least 8 weeks before the
study.
After initial evaluation, patients received 20 mg/day
olmesartan, which was increased to 40 mg/day over a
24-week period. Doses of other antihypertensive agents
and statins were maintained during the study. BP measure-
ments were performed at the outpatient clinic according to
Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) 2009 guidelines
at fixed times after the administration of medications.15
Target BP was <130/80 mmHg. Measurements were made
using a sphygmomanometer (Nippon Colin Co. Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan) and performed twice with the patient seated
after a 5-min rest.
At each patient visit, safety variables and patient com-
pliance with treatment regimens were assessed. Plasma
renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were meas-
ured by radioimmunoassay at a contract laboratory (SRL,
Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at baseline and at week 24 with the
patient in the supine position after a 20-min rest. Urinary
albumin excretion was assessed by measuring urinary con-
centrations of albumin and Cr (albumin/Cr ratio) in the first
morning urine sample. Urinary albumin levels were meas-
ured by the immunoturbidimetric assay. Urinary liver-type
fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) was measured in the
same urine sample by a specific enzyme linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA; SRL, Inc.), and the results were
expressed relative to the urinary Cr concentration. Urinary
ACE2 concentration was measured at baseline and at week
24 by ELISA (Human ACE2 ELISA Kit, AdipoGen, Inc.,
Seoul, Korea) as described previously.16,17 The eGFR was
calculated according to the following formula for Japanese
patients18: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 194 × sCr­1.094 × age­
0.287(× 0.739 for women).
Data are expressed as means ± SEM. Changes in bio-
chemical and urinalysis parameters were analyzed using
the paired t-test. The relationships between variables were
analyzed using Pearson's correlation. Determinants of the
factors associated with the changes in urinary ACE2 levels
were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Age,
sex, body mass index, changes in systolic and diastolic BP,
urinary albumin/Cr ratio, and levels of eGFR, plasma glu-
cose, HbA1c, plasma aldosterone, and urinary L-FABP
were selected for the multivariate model. SAS 8.13 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all analysis, and signifi-
cance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
All enrolled patients (n = 31) remained in the study until
the end of the trial. Baseline characteristics and concomi-
tant medication use at baseline are shown in Table 1.

Fifteen patients (48%) were using other antihypertensive
agents at baseline. The final olmesartan dose was
26 ± 2 mg/day. As shown in Table 2, olmesartan treat-
ment significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic
BP values. No significant differences were seen in serum
Cr levels or eGFR values during the study period.
Furthermore, urinary L-FABP level was significantly
decreased after olmesartan treatment. Figure 1 shows
that the urinary albumin/Cr ratio was significantly
decreased by olmesartan treatment from 720 ± 201 mg/
gCr at baseline to 317 ± 91 mg/gCr at the end of the
study (p < 0.01), whereas urinary ACE2 concentration
was significantly increased from 27.8 ± 4.6 ng/mgCr at
baseline to 42.9 ± 7.0 ng/mgCr at the end of the study
(p < 0.05). Figure 2 shows that plasma renin activity
was not significantly changed after 24 weeks of
treatment, but plasma aldosterone levels were decreased
from 97.6 ± 10.4 at baseline to 77.5 ± 6.7 pg/mL at the
end of the study (p < 0.05).
In a simple regression analysis, changes in urinary
ACE2 levels correlated significantly with changes in uri-
nary L-FABP levels (r = 0.427, p = 0.016), but not with
systolic and diastolic BP, urinary albumin/Cr ratio, or
eGFR levels (Table 3). Multivariable regression analysis
showed that urinary L-FABP levels were an independent
predictor of changes in urinary ACE2 levels (R2 = 0.426)
(Table 4).
During the observation period, none of the patients
exhibited a significant increase in the occurrence of adverse
effects such as hypotension, and none required renal
replacement therapy for hyperkalemia or progressive loss
of kidney function.

Discussion
Ang-(1-7) is formed fromAng I andAng II mainly byACE2
and acts on the receptor protein Mas.19 Based on these inter-
actions, a new bioactive pathway in the RAS, referred to as
the ACE2­Ang­(1-7)­Mas axis, has been proposed.20,21
This axis is antagonistic to the classical RAS pathway with
ACE­Ang II­Ang II type 1 receptors.22,23 Deletion or inhi-
bition ofACE2 has been associated with albuminuria in dia-
beticmice24,25 andwiththedevelopmentofAngII-dependent
renal damage.14 Conversely, administration of human
recombinant ACE2 was shown to reduce BP and attenuate
glomerular injury in rodent models.26,27 Furthermore, ACE2
delivery by a recombinant protein or virus ameliorated the
progression of diabetes-related complications, such as
nephropathy and retinopathy.28­30 Thus, ACE2 may be an
endogenous protector against the progression of CKD.
Chronic administration of either telmisartan or capto-
pril did not change urinaryACE2 levels in mice.31 Previous
studies in humans have shown no significant effects of
ARBs or ACE inhibitors on urinary ACE2 levels,17,32
although in these studies the effects were analyzed for
ARBs in general, not for specific ARBs. Furthermore, uri-
nary ACE2 levels in patients treated with olmesartan for
>1 year were higher than in healthy controls, although
other antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel
blockers and other RAS inhibitors, had no such effects on
urinary ACE2 levels in an observational study.33 However,
the urine samples for ACE2 determination were collected
only once, and thus the extent of changes in ACE2 levels
due to antihypertensive agents could not be critically
assessed. Taken together, no interventional studies have
examined whether ARBs can definitely increase ACE2
activity in humans. Here, we demonstrated that the ARB
olmesartan can increase urinary ACE2 levels and decrease
plasma aldosterone levels in diabetic nephropathy patients
with CKD. Many functional differences exist among
ARBs that are not mediated by Ang II type 1 receptor

blockade.34 Long-term treatment of hypertensive patients
with olmesartan reduces plasma Ang II levels, whereas
several other types of ARBs have been reported to increase
plasma Ang II levels in hypertensive patients.35­37 These
findings suggest that the increased ACE2 activity due to
olmesartan contributes to reduced plasma Ang II levels by
upregulating Ang-(1-7) formation.
Urinary ACE2 levels are associated with hyperglyce-
mia, and insulin treatment has been observed to reduce
urinary ACE2 levels in mice.31 However, no significant
associations were observed in the present study between
changes in urinary ACE2 levels and changes in glycemic
indices, including plasma glucose and HbA1c levels,
since only well-controlled patients were assessed.
Although it has been reported that some calcium channel
blockers, including benidipine, azelnidipine, and cilnidi-
pine, reduced albuminuria in diabetic nephropathy,38­40
many of the patients in the present study had been treated
with amlodipine for at least 8 weeks at baseline, suggest-
ing only a slight effect of amlodipine on decreasing the
urinary albumin/Cr ratio and increasing urinary ACE2
levels. However, the changes in urinary ACE2 levels cor-
related significantly with urinary L-FABP levels in the
present study. Significant urinary ACE2 levels most likely
reflect the state of the proximal tubules, and differences
may exist in patients with CKD and tubular injury com-
pared with healthy individuals.41 In patients with diabetic
nephropathy, the development of progressive diabetic
kidney disease was associated with changes in proximal
tubules, renal function, and prognosis and showed a
higher correlation with structural lesions in the tubuloint-
erstitium than with glomerular changes.42 Various proxi-
mal tubule pathophysiological stresses, such as
proteinuria, induce upregulation of human L-FABP gene
expression, thereby resulting in increased proximal tubu-
lar L-FABP excretion and increased urinary L-FABP
excretion.43 Urinary L-FABP is an important marker of
tubulointerstitial changes in diabetic nephropathy, while
oxidative stress is a pathogenic factor underlying diabetic
complications such as nephropathy.44­46 Because multi-
variate regression analysis showed that urinary L-FABP is
an independent variable significantly associated with
urinary ACE2 levels, olmesartan may have potential
against the progression of tubulointerstitial damage due to
increased urinary ACE2 levels. Nevertheless, further
studies are needed to identify the factors associated with
the increase in ACE2 levels, as ACE2 has the potential to
be a marker of renal RAS activation in these patients.
Our study design was limited by the small sample size,
short treatment duration, and lack of a control group since it
was a preliminary investigation. Furthermore, we did not
measure plasma levels of Ang-(1-7), Ang II, and ACE2, or
urinary ACE2 activity, in this study, and thus the changes in
ACE2 activity and their impact on the RAS may not have
been fully characterized. Additional long-term studies are
needed to accurately assess the renoprotective effects of
olmesartan therapy in diabetes patients. Moreover, it should
be clarified whether ARBs other than olmesartan have the
same potential to increase urinary ACE2 levels.
In conclusion, olmesartan treatment leads to a reduction
in albuminuria, urinary L-FABP, and plasma aldosterone
levels in diabetes patients with CKD; however, it may have
the unique effect of increasing urinary ACE2 levels. Some
previous studies in mice and humans have shown that other
RAS blockers do not increase urinaryACE2 levels. Whether
this unique increase contributes to olmesartan's renoprotec-
tive effect must be examined further in a future study.
