Introduction
Citizens have two main types of actions in their political
toolkits: electoral and non-electoral. Recent work at the
macro-level has observed substitution between these two
categories over time (Dalton, 2008), while individual-level
analysis has suggested a positive correlation (Oser, 2016).
However, the causal relationship between these two forms
of participation remains unclear. Does engaging in one type
cause more or less of the other type? As a practical matter,
can organizations leverage prior activity in one category to
induce the other?
Nonprofit organizations provide a useful context for
studying causal relationships within the political toolkit
(Han, 2016). These organizations can facilitate electoral
participation through voter mobilization efforts (LeRoux
and Krawczyk, 2014). In addition, nonprofits often experi-
ment with different kinds of appeals to induce a wide range
of non-electoral actions (Han, 2009). Furthermore, some of
the most effective appeals establish a relational context by
linking current requests to prior behavior (Han, 2016).
This study leverages a sample of more than 140,000 reg-
istered voters to better understand who participates in mod-
ern forms of civic engagement and what kinds of appeals
are most effective. The results of an online field experiment
yielded two main results. Subjects who voted in the 2016
primary elections were nearly three times more likely to
engage with a survey distributed by a civic organization
than those who did not vote in the primary election.
However, explicitly priming voter identity and gratitude
made all subjects far less likely to engage in this form of
civic participation. These results may offer some practical
wisdom to nonprofit organizations and improve our under-
standing of how voters manage their political toolkits.
Experimental design
A field experiment was conducted in collaboration with a
pro-housing civic organization in San Francisco, California.
The organization designed a survey to measure public opin-
ion about issues affecting the community and wanted to
maximize participation. The sample for the experiment
included 140,189 registered voters who provided their email
address during the registration process. This design did not
control for information spillovers between multiple units in
the same household (Coppock, 2014), although interference
should bias against significant treatment effects.
The survey was distributed via email using a fully
crossed 2 2

Abstract
How does voting interact with civic engagement outside the electoral process? An online field experiment on more than
140,000 registered voters in San Francisco yielded two main results. Subjects who voted in the 2016 primary elections
were nearly three times more likely to open a survey from a nonprofit organization than those who did not vote in the
primary election. However, explicitly priming voter identity and gratitude made all subjects far less likely to engage in
this form of civic participation.

identity manipulation occurred in the subject line of the
email: "SF [voter/resident], what are your priorities for the
city?" This manipulation was inspired by prior research on
the effects of priming voter identity (Bryan et al., 2011),
although it does not rely on subtle linguistic cues (Gerber
et al., 2016). The voter gratitude manipulation occurred in
the first line in the body of the email: treated subjects were
thanked for being a registered voter in San Francisco
(Panagopoulos, 2011), while subjects in the control condi-
tion were again asked what was important to them.
Crucially, this control condition did not include any addi-
tional language that was not already contained by the treat-
ment condition.
The outcome variable measured whether the subject
clicked the link embedded in the email to open the survey.
Since survey responses were anonymous, it was not possi-
ble to match this click rate with survey completion rates.
However, it is expected that treatment assignment had no
effect on the probability of completing the survey given
that the subject had already clicked to open the survey.
Results
The voter file contained information about subjects' party
identification, age, and whether they voted in the 2016 pri-
mary election that occurred two months prior to the experi-
ment.1 Figure 1 explores which of these characteristics were
associated with higher click rates. The most striking result is
that subjects who voted in the primary election were nearly
three times as likely to open the survey than non-voters.
This result may reflect the fact that participatory citizens
tend to embrace both non-institutionalized and electoral-
oriented activities (Oser, 2016), or that voters are more
likely to contribute to public goods (Bolsen et al., 2014).
Figure 2 reports the results associated with the experi-
mental manipulations. Surprisingly, subjects in all three
treatment conditions were about 40% less likely to open the
survey than subjects in the control condition ( p = 0.000).2
This result is even more remarkable given the relatively
low baseline, as floor effects should have biased against
finding significant treatment effects. Floor effects may,
however, explain why the identity and gratitude manipula-
tions did not appear to have an additive effect on click rates.
What explains this decrease in civic engagement? Since
the manipulations conflated voter identity and gratitude
with politics more generally, one explanation could be that
subjects are simply averse to politics. This mechanism
seems unlikely since all subjects are registered voters who
volunteered their email addresses during the registration
process. Furthermore, if the main effect was driven by an
aversion to politics, then this effect should be smaller for
subjects with higher levels of interest in politics. Instead,
treatment effects were significant and just as large for sub-
jects who voted in the primary election as those who did not
vote. In fact, the voter identity treatment effect was slightly
larger for primary voters.
A separate but related mechanism is voter fatigue. The
experiment was conducted three months before a general
election in a state that include several propositions on the
ballot. Therefore, treated subjects may have exhausted their
capacity to engage in electoral politics and potentially mis-
construed the email as one about the general election. This
mechanism is consistent with the larger treatment effect
observed among primary voters.
Alternatively, the priming of past voting behavior may
have caused a boost in self-concept that subsequently ena-
bled treated subjects to feel "licensed" to dismiss addi-
tional requests to take costly civic action (Merritt et al.,
2010). This mechanism would also be consistent with
larger treatment effects among primary voters, although

licensing should apply only to the voter gratitude treat-
ment. These data cannot fully distinguish between the
voter fatigue and licensing mechanisms because self-con-
cept was not measured directly.
Discussion
This paper explored whether voting influences civic
engagement outside the electoral process. The results of an
online field experiment on more than 140,000 registered
voters in San Francisco yielded two main results. First, sub-
jects who voted in the recent primary election were far
more likely to open a survey from a nonprofit organization
than those who did not vote in the primary election.
However, at least one attempt to explicitly leverage prior
voting behavior had negative unintended consequences.
Priming voter identity and gratitude made subjects far less
likely to engage in this form of non-electoral participation.
The results of this experiment may offer practical wisdom
to nonprofit organizations looking to improve the effective-
ness of their appeals. Of course, these data were generated by
a unique sample of registered voters at a particular time in the
electoral cycle. In addition, interacting with a survey distrib-
uted by a nonprofit organization is hardly representative of all
forms of non-electoral civic engagement. Therefore, addi-
tional research is needed to evaluate the generalizability of
these results. Future work should continue to explore the con-
ditions under which citizens construe the various items in
their political toolkits as complements or substitutes.

Notes
1. Gender was also available for a non-random subset of 58,758
subjects, but including this covariate did not substantively
change the results (see "Supplemental information" for more
details).
2. The four experimental conditions were slightly imbalanced
on levels of primary voting. However, covariate adjustment
has no substantive effect on the magnitude or significance of
average treatment effects (see "Supplemental information"
for more details).
