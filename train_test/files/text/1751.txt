Conditions on Adolescents' Physical Activity
and Sedentary Behaviors

Objective: To test whether physical activity and sed-
entary behaviors are associated with perceived and struc-
tural neighborhood conditions.
Design: Secondary analysis of data from wave I (1994-
1995) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health in the United States.
Setting: In-home interviews of adolescents and their
parents.
Participants: Thirteen thousand six hundred sixty-
eight adolescents (6794 adolescent boys and 6874 ado-
lescent girls; grades 7-12).
Main Exposures: Perceived neighborhood conditions
(public nuisance, acquaintanceship, and informal con-
trol measured at both individual and census tract levels)
and structural neighborhood characteristics (concen-
trated poverty, immigrant concentration, and residential
stability at the census tract level).
Outcome Measures: Failure to meet moderate to vig-
orous physical activity (MVPA) guidelines (5 bouts of
MVPA per week) and excessive screen time (2 hours
per day).
Results: Individual-level perception of intermediate (ad-
justed odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.68-0.84) or high (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.50-0.61) acquain-
tanceship and high informal control (OR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.82-0.99) in the neighborhood were negatively associ-
ated with failure to meet the MVPA guidelines compared
with lower levels. At the census tract level, high informal
control (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.29) and intermediate
(OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26) and high (OR, 1.22; 95%
CI, 1.06-1.40) concentrated poverty compared with lower
levels were also associated with failing to meet the MVPA
guidelines (when adjusted for sociodemographic charac-
teristics). Compared with the lowest levels, high public
nuisance (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.04-1.36) and immigrant
concentration (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.38) at the cen-
sus tract level were associated with excessive screen time.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that both percep-
tual and structural neighborhood factors should be con-
sidered to understand adolescents' physical activity and
sedentary behaviors.

OBESITY CONTINUES TO BE A
growing public health
concern in the United
States.1 Physical activity
and sedentary behaviors
are among the key behavioral targets of ef-
forts to address this public health con-
cern.2 Owing to a recognition of the mul-
tifaceted causes of the obesity epidemic,3
there has been an increased focus on un-
derstanding contextual effects on obesity,
physical activity, and sedentary behaviors
among children and adolescents. Neigh-
borhood conditions can affect where and
how adolescents spend their time.4 Be-
cause parents may be influenced by haz-
ardousneighborhoodconditions,theymay
want to keep their younger children inside
ofthehome,5 fearingthattheirchildrenmay
get into trouble if they spend time outside
without proper supervision. Thus, chil-
dren and adolescents may not be able to
spend their time on active outdoor activi-
ties even if they want to unless their neigh-
borhood provides appropriate environ-
ments, such as parks, gyms, playgrounds,
recreational facilities, and/or sidewalks.6-8
Several theoretical frameworks have
been proposed to understand the associa-
tion between neighborhood conditions and
adolescents' behaviors in general. The in-
stitutional resource model for contextual
effects assumes that various types of re-
sources in the community (eg, schools,
child care, parks, and libraries) could in-
fluence neighborhood residents' out-
comes.9 Inner-city neighborhood struc-
tural conditions, defined as concentrated
poverty, immigrant concentration, unem-
ployment, and/or residential mobility, were

used to explain residents' behavioral changes.10 These
neighborhood structural characteristics are also shown to
be associated with various adolescents' developmental and
behavioral outcomes, including childhood intelligence,
school readiness and achievement, internalized and ex-
ternalized behavioral problems, sexual onset, and teen-
age births.9,11-13 In contrast, collective efficacy theorists pos-
tulatethatperceptualneighborhoodfactors,includingsocial
network, informal control, mutual trust, and shared norms
among residents in the neighborhood, may capture mea-
sures of neighborhood-level capacity to monitor local
youths' behavior and act as regulatory mechanisms.14,15
Thesetheoreticalapproacheswereusedtounderstandado-
lescents' problematic behaviors such as juvenile delin-
quency,gangactivity,and/oralcoholanddruguseandhave
not often been used to understand the direct associations
between neighborhood safety and obesity status.16,17 How-
ever, one can argue that these problematic behaviors in
the neighborhood may influence parents' perception of the
neighborhood and thus may indirectly influence adoles-
cents' physical activities and sedentary behaviors.
Previous studies linking neighborhood characteris-
tics to obesity, physical activity, and sedentary behav-
iors have mainly used the institutional resource theory
and used built environment and other available re-
sources, existence, and access thereof as primary indi-
cators of neighborhood condition.6-8,18,19 However, grow-
ing evidences suggest that residents' perception of their
neighborhood conditions such as neighborhood safety
may be a critical indicator of their behavior. For ex-
ample, Burdette and Whitaker3 found that, after adjust-
ment for sociodemographic factors, mothers' percep-
tion of higher neighborhood safety was related to lower
television viewing hours in their children. To our knowl-
edge, no studies have simultaneously included a com-
prehensive set of both structural and perceptual neigh-
borhood factors in the model of adolescents' physical
activities and sedentary behaviors.
In this cross-sectional study using the data from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health), we aim to fill this gap in the literature by ex-
amining the associations of both structural and percep-
tual neighborhood factors with adolescents' physical
activities and sedentary behaviors. This study will shed
new light on understanding additive and independent
contributions of the 2 different facets of neighborhood
factors on adolescents' physical activity and sedentary be-
haviors. Furthermore, individual perception of neigh-
borhood factors were aggregated in their neighborhood
and included in the model to capture macroscopic col-
lective neighborhood perceptions. We hypothesized that,
after adjustment for individual-level sociodemographic
factors and individual- and census tract­level percep-
tion of neighborhood conditions, adolescents' odds of not
meetingphysicalactivityguidelinesandofexcessivescreen
time are positively associated with structural neighbor-
hood characteristics (eg, higher poverty, higher immi-
grant concentration, and lower residential stability).
We also hypothesized that these 2 behaviors are posi-
tively associated with individual perception about the
neighborhood conditions and average neighborhood
perception about neighborhood conditions (eg, lower in-
formal control, lower acquaintanceship, and higher pub-
lic nuisance) after adjusting for structural neighborhood
characteristics.
METHODS
Add Health is a nationally representative, school-based study of
adolescents (grades 7-12) in 1994 and 1995. This study used only
wave I data of Add Health. Of 20 745 adolescents who were en-
rolled, 18 924 had valid sampling weights. We excluded 110 ado-
lescents who had any type of physical disability and 2946 ado-
lescents with missing values in any neighborhood variables. In
addition, we eliminated 2200 adolescents owing to listwise de-
letion of missing values in the covariates used in the models. Fi-
nally, we excluded 2 adolescents who did not provide valid an-
swers to the sedentary behavior questions, resulting in a final
analytic sample of 13668 adolescents (6794 boys and 6874 girls).
MEASURES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
AND SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS
In the in-home interviews, Add Health researchers used a 7-day
recall questionnaire that is commonly used in other large-scale
epidemiologic studies to assess daily physical activities and sed-
entary behaviors.20-22 Based on self-reports, we developed a mea-
sure of meeting physical activity recommendations, defined as
participating in 5 or more bouts of moderate to vigorous physi-
cal activity (MVPA) per week.23 In our analysis, MVPA referred
to activities that cost 5 to 8 metabolic equivalents. Metabolic
equivalentswereassignedusingacompendium24 inwhich1meta-
bolic equivalent is defined as the energy expenditure associated
with quiet sitting. Three of 5 questions were related to MVPA
andusedtocalculateeachadolescent'sboutsofMVPA.Theywere
worded as "During the past week, how many times did you . . . "
and followed by a description of a specific MVPA activity: (1)
roller/bicycling (eg, rollerblading, rollerskating, skateboarding,
or bicycling); (2) active sports (eg, baseball, softball, basketball,
soccer,swimming,orfootball),and(3)exercise(eg,jogging,walk-
ing, karate, jumping rope, gymnastics, or dancing). The follow-
ing scores were assigned to each answer category: 0 (not at all),
1.5 (1 or 2 times), 3.5 (3 or 4 times), and 5 (5 times). We then
further dichotomized the sum of MVPA scores into those meet-
ing the MVPA guideline (5 bouts of MVPA per week) and those
failingtomeettheMVPAguideline(5boutsofMVPAperweek).
Sedentary behaviors were assessed via 3 questions. Each was
worded as "How many hours a week do you . . . " and in-
volved activities like watching television and videos and play-
ing video or computer games. Answers to these 3 questions were
summed to create a total time (hours per week) that adoles-
cents spent on sedentary activities. Twenty-five respondents who
had impossible values (168 hours/week) were recoded as 168
hours. Using national guidelines,25,26 we defined exceeding rec-
ommended total screen time as more than 2 hours per day.
MEASURES OF PERCEIVED
NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITION
Perceptual domain of neighborhood factors was captured by 3
summary variables (ie, public nuisance, acquaintanceship, and
informal control) measured at the individual level. These fac-
torswereusedinpreviousneighborhoodstudiestoexamineado-
lescent behavioral outcomes such as sexual onset12 and delin-
quency.27 Inthisstudy,theacquaintanceshipmeasurewasbased

(1=definitely would; 5=definitely would not); answers were re-
verse-coded and then aggregated into a mean scale. Public nui-

neighborhood, how big a problem is litter or trash on the streets
and sidewalks?" (2) "In this neighborhood, how big a problem
are drug dealers and drug users?" and (3) "How much would

Likert scales (1=no problem at all; 2=a small problem; 3=a big
problemforthefirst2questionsand1=notatall;2=alittle;3=very
much for the last) were used for parents' responses, which were
aggregated into a mean scale of public nuisance.
To capture the contextual effects of these neighborhood per-
ceptions,28 an average score of individual-level measures of per-
ceptual neighborhood factors for individual participants living
in the same census tract based on the 1990 census was calcu-
lated to create neighborhood-level measures of perceptual do-
main. These aggregated variables measure macroscopic and col-
lective contextual aspects of the neighborhood perceptions
measured at the individual level. Social scientists have widely
used this approach to capture contextual effects based on indi-
vidual-level characteristics.29 This resulted in 3 census tract­
level perceptual domain neighborhood factors (ie, acquaintance-
ship, informal control, and public nuisance variables). We
calculated the reliability of these aggregate variables based on in-
dividual-level responses using the procedure suggested by
O'Brien.29 We chose the 1990 census tract as the geographical
boundary of a neighborhood unit because census tracts are large
enough to provide a reliable and homogeneous aggregated mea-
sureofcharacteristics30 andsmallenoughtobeconsideredaneigh-
borhood unit. On average, 10.1 respondents (range, 1-279) lived
in a census tract, and 697 (5.1%) respondents lived in a tract with
1 respondent to Add Health. In the final analysis sample, 13 668
respondents were from 1974 different census tracts.
MEASURES OF STRUCTURAL
NEIGHBORHOOD CONDITION
DrawingonWilson10,31 andcollectiveefficacytheory,14,15,32 Brown-
ing and colleagues12 identified concentrated poverty, immigrant
concentration, and residential stability as key structural neigh-
borhood factors associated with adolescent outcomes. Nine cen-
sus measures were selected based on theories and previous stud-
ies and subject to principal components analysis to create the 3
structural neighborhood factor scores.12 Concentrated poverty
was measured by the proportion of households with an income
belowpovertylevel,publicassistance,singlefemale­headedhouse-
holds, and unemployment rate. Immigrant concentration score
was calculated using the proportion of Hispanic and foreign-
born individuals and those with limited English skills. Residen-
tial stability score was assessed by the proportion of households
living in the same house for 5 years or longer and the proportion
of housing occupied by owners. Because our neighborhood con-
textualmeasureswerecreatedbasedonmultipleitems,eachmea-
sure used a different scale. To facilitate the interpretation of re-
sults, both the perceptual and structural domain neighborhood
factor scores were divided into tertiles to provide for an equal
number of participants in each response category.
MEASURES OF COVARIATES
We considered a number of sociodemographic variables in our
analyses. They were adolescents' age, sex, race/ethnicity, in-
school status, region and nativity from the in-home question-
naire, and the highest parental education and household in-
come from the Parent Questionnaire.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the
associations between these neighborhood factors and adoles-
cents' physical activity (failure to meet MVPA guideline: 5
bouts per week) and sedentary behavior (excessive screen time:
2 hours per day), controlling for all covariates. We tested the
interaction terms between sex and each neighborhood factor.
None of them were statistically significant at P.05. Thus, we
did not provide sex-stratified results. Stata,33 version 10, was
used for the statistical analyses.
RESULTS
SAMPLE AND NEIGHBORHOOD
CHARACTERISTICS
Our final analysis sample was 49% female and 51% male;
and 68% white, 14% black, 11% Hispanic, 3% Asian/
PacificIslander,and4%ofotherracial/ethnicorigin.Among
them, 95% were born in the United States. The mean age
at wave I was 15.8 years. About 31% of parents had at least
acollegeeducation,59%werehighschoolgraduatesorhad
some college education, and 11% were not high school
graduates. Mean household income was $45 476 per year
(Table 1).
On average, parents answered that public nuisance (ie,
litter or trash on the streets; drug dealers and drug users)
was not a problem at all or was a small problem in their
neighborhood (mean [standard error (SE)] score, 1.55
[0.02]). Three out of 4 times, adolescents indicated that
they knew most of the people in their neighborhood, they
hadstoppedonthestreettotalktosomeoneintheirneigh-
borhood, and their neighbors looked out for each other
(mean[SE]score,0.75[0.01]).Parentsrespondedthatthey

identical after aggregating at the census tract level
(Table 2).
NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS
AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Table 3 shows the bivariate relationship between neigh-
borhood characteristics and meeting the MVPA guide-
line. Adolescents' perception of neighborhood acquain-
tanceship was associated with failing to meet the MVPA
guideline outcome (44%, 36%, and 29% from the lowest
to the highest tertile; P.001). The proportion of adoles-

cents failing to meet the MVPA guideline decreased sig-
nificantly from the lowest to the highest tertiles of per-
ceived informal control, from 38% to 33% to 32%,
respectively (P.001).
In census tract­level neighborhood measures, the pro-
portion of adolescents who failed to meet the MVPA guide-
line was significantly associated with average acquain-
tanceship (38%, 33%, and 32%, respectively, from the
lowest to the highest tertile; P=.004) and concentrated
poverty (30%, 35%, and 38%, respectively, from the low-
est to the highest tertile; P=.001).
Table 4 presents the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of fail-
ing to meet the MVPA guideline for each neighborhood
factor in multilevel logistic regression analyses. After con-
trolling for the effects of sex, race/ethnicity, age, parental
education, in-school status, nativity status, region, and
householdincome,adolescentsinthemiddle(adjustedOR,
0.76; P.001) or the highest (adjusted OR, 0.56; P.001)
tertile of neighborhood acquaintanceship were less likely
to fail to meet the MVPA guideline than those in the low-
est tertile. Children of parents with the highest tertile of
perceived informal neighborhood control compared with
the lowest were less likely (adjusted OR, 0.90; P=.03) to
fail to meet the MVPA guideline.
At the census tract level, adolescents living in the neigh-
borhood with the highest tertile of informal control com-
pared with the lowest tertile were more likely to fail to
meet the MVPA guideline (adjusted OR, 1.16; P=.01).
For structural domain neighborhood characteristics, ado-
lescents in the middle (adjusted OR, 1.13; P=.03) or high-
est (adjusted OR, 1.22; P=.006) tertile of concentrated
poverty compared with the lowest tertile were signifi-
cantly more likely to fail to meet the MVPA guideline.
NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS
AND SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS
As Table 3 shows, adolescents' perception of neighbor-
hood acquaintanceship was not associated with exces-
sive screen time. The proportion of adolescents with ex-
cessivescreenhoursincreasedsignificantlyfromthelowest
to the highest tertiles of perceived informal control from
53% to 54% to 57%, respectively (P=.02). Across the 3 ter-
tiles of perceived public nuisance, from the lowest to the
highest,theproportionofadolescentswithexcessivescreen
time went up from 52% to 55% to 59%, respectively
(P.001).
In census tract­level neighborhood measures, the pro-
portionofadolescentswithexcessivescreentimewasposi-
tively associated with changes in average informal con-
trol (52%, 54%, and 60% from the lowest to the highest
tertiles, respectively; P=.002), average public nuisance
(49%, 55%, and 62% from the lowest to the highest ter-
tiles, respectively; P.001), and concentrated poverty

COMMENT
In this national sample of adolescents, we found that fail-
ing to meet MVPA guidelines was negatively associated
with parents' perception of higher neighborhood infor-
mal control and adolescents' perception of higher neigh-
borhoodacquaintanceshipattheindividuallevelandhigher
census tract average perception of acquaintanceship and
lower concentrated poverty at the neighborhood level. All
of the relationships except that of census tract­level av-
erage acquaintanceship were significant even after adjust-
ing for other covariates. Interestingly, the association of
census tract­level average informal control was signifi-
cant in the final model, whereas it was not in the unad-
justed bivariate analyses.
We also found that parents' perception of higher public
nuisance and informal control in individual- and census
tract­levelandhighercensustract­levelconcentratedpov-
ertywereassociatedwithincreasedoddsofadolescentshav-
ing excessive screen time in a bivariate relationship. After
theadjustmentforcovariatesandotherneighborhoodfac-
tors,noneoftheindividual-levelperceptionvariableswere
significant. The results also indicate that, after controlling
forindividual-levelsocioeconomicfactors,neighborhood-
levelmeasuresofperceptualandstructuralfactorsaremore

level perception of their neighborhood.
Some findings are inconsistent with previous studies.
In our study, individual-level parental perception of pub-
lic nuisance, which is related to neighborhood safety, was
not significantly associated with any outcomes in the fi-
nal model. However, in another study using the data from
the Fragile Families and Children's Well-Being Study, au-
thors found that mothers' perception of neighborhood
safety, measured by items similar to our measure of pub-
licnuisance,wasrelatedtotheirchildren'stelevisionwatch-
ing time but not to their outdoor physical activities.3 This
discrepancy may be partly explained by the children's age
differences between the 2 studies. It is plausible that ado-
lescentsinAddHealthwerelessinfluencedthanpreschool-
aged children in Fragile Families and Children's Well-
Being Study by their parents' control over how and where
they spent their time, which may be related to parental as-
sessment about their neighborhood safety. Together, these
findings indicate that the average perception of neighbor-
hood condition across residents in the neighborhood may
be a more important predictor of adolescents' television
viewing hours than it is for younger children.
This study is unique because we used both parents'
and adolescents' perceptions of their neighborhood con-
ditions. After adjustment for sociodemographic covari-

ates, we found that adolescents' perception of neighbor-
hood acquaintanceship was more strongly associated with
odds of meeting the MVPA guideline than any of the pa-
rental perception variables (ie, public nuisance and in-
formal control) or other neighborhood-level variables.
However, we do not know to what extent the appar-
ently stronger association of adolescents' perception of
acquaintanceship should be attributed to the fact that this
measure was based on their own responses; the other 2
perception measures were based on parental responses.
Future studies should ask the same sets of questions to
both parents and adolescents to disentangle relative con-
tribution of these 2 factors.
We hypothesized that if parents felt a higher level of
informal control in their neighborhood, they would feel
safer and would encourage their children to go out and
playmoreandthatthechildrenwouldthusspendlesstime
on screen activities. However, the individual-level paren-
tal perception of informal control conformed to our hy-
pothesis, whereas the census tract­level aggregate of in-
formal control perception was positively associated with
oddsoffailingtomeettheMVPAguideline.Wealsonoted
that the parental perception of informal control was not
significantbeforethecensustract­levelmeasureswereen-
tered in the model, which indicates a suppression effect.34
Further analysis of cross-level interaction between indi-
vidual and census tract­level perception of informal con-
trol (results not shown) reveals that the association be-
tween parental perception of informal control and
adolescents' odds of failing to meet the MVPA guideline
tends to be attenuated if they live in a neighborhood with
a higher level of collective informal control, though the
coefficient of cross-level interaction failed to reach sig-
nificance at P.05. In other words, the parental percep-

tion of informal control in their neighborhood becomes
increasinglyinfluentialif they live in a neighborhood with
a lower level of informal control.
One of the limitations of this study is that we classi-
fied an adolescent as meeting physical activity recommen-
dations if he or she was active at least 5 days of the week.
The newest federal guidelines published in late 2008 sug-
gest that children should be active on all days.35 Further-
more, because Add Health did not contain information on
the duration of the physical activity, we included any ac-
tivity regardless of duration. This likely affected the esti-
matedpercentagesofchildrenwhofailedtomeettheMVPA
guidelineinoursample.However,webelievethatthismea-
surement error would be independent of neighborhood
characteristics of interest in our study; thus, this would
attenuatetheassociationsofinterest.Itshouldalsobenoted
that, owing to lack of information in Add Health, we could
not account for the effect of built environments, some of
which have been reported to be associated with physical
activities in other studies.36,37 Furthermore, the reliability
measures of census tract­level perception of neighbor-
hoodcharacteristicswerelow,partlyowingtosmallsample
sizes in each census tract. Despite this, the significant find-
ings at the census tract level indicate the robustness of the
associations between neighborhood variables and physi-
cal activity and sedentary behaviors in our study.
Both research and practice fields have tried increas-
ingly to understand the association between neighbor-
hood factors and physical activity behaviors.4,8,38 Yet, the
mainfocusisplacedonunderstandingthephysical,orbuilt,
environment and its association with physical activity, sed-
entary behaviors, and/or obesity.8,18,19,39,40 Neighborhood
conditions are multifaceted and should be conceptual-
ized across different dimensions.9 For example, per-
ceived level of social disorder and collective efficacy may
influence how and where people spend their time in re-
lationtophysicalactivityandsedentarybehaviors.16,41 How-
ever, there is only a limited number of studies focusing
on other aspects of neighborhood conditions, such as resi-
dents' perception of their neighborhood condition. This
study contributes to the existing literature by placing its
focusonbothperceptualandstructuralneighborhoodchar-
acteristics and their associations with adolescents' MVPA
and screen time using data from a large nationally repre-
sentative sample. If future studies can further replicate our
findings, this would suggest that, to combat obesity and
physical inactivity epidemics in the United States, public
health professionals and pediatric care providers should
take into account the important roles of perceived and
structural neighborhood characteristics in behavioral
choices above and beyond individual attributes.
