OBJECTIVEdThere is limited information on whether recent improvements in the control of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among individuals with diabetes have been concen-
trated in particular sociodemographic groups. This article estimates racial/ethnic- and education-
related disparities and examines trends in uncontrolled CVD risk factors among adults with
diabetes. The main racial/ethnic comparisons made are with African Americans versus non-
Latino whites and Mexican Americans versus non-Latino whites.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdThe analysis samples include adults aged $20
years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988­1994 and
the NHANES 1999­2008 who self-reported having diabetes (n = 1,065, NHANES 1988­1994;
n = 1,872, NHANES 1999­2008). By use of logistic regression models, we examined the corre-
lates of binary indicators measuring 1) high blood glucose, 2) high blood pressure, 3) high
cholesterol, and 4) smoking.
RESULTSdControl of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol improved among indi-
viduals with diabetes between the NHANES 1988­1994 and the NHANES 1999­2008, but there
was no change in smoking prevalence. In the NHANES 1999­2008, racial/ethnic minorities and
individuals without some college education were more likely to have poorly controlled blood
glucose compared with non-Latino whites and those with some college education. In addition,
individuals with diabetes who had at least some college education were less likely to smoke and
had better blood pressure control compared with individuals with diabetes without at least some
college education.
CONCLUSIONSdTrends in CVD risk factors among individuals with diabetes improved
over the past 2 decades, but racial/ethnic- and education-related disparities have emerged in
some areas.

Diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in the U.S., and the
prevalence of this disease is rising
(1). The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, based on data from the National
Health Interview Survey, estimated that the
age-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed diabe-
tes increased from 3.7% in 1980 to 7.7% in
2008 (2). The total direct and indirect costs
associated with diabetes in the U.S. were
estimated to be $174 billion in 2007, with
~33% ($58 billion) of the total cost being
attributed to treatment of medical com-
plications (3). Cardiovascular disease
(CVD) is a widely documented potential
complication of diabetes and a leading
cause of mortality among individuals
with diabetes (4­6). Although rates of
CVD events have declined in recent de-
cades among both individuals with and
without diabetes, people with diabetes still
are twice as likely as those without diabetes
to experience a CVD event (4), and individ-
uals with diabetes have heart disease mor-
tality rates that are two to four times greater
than those without diabetes (6).
To prevent CVD and other complica-
tions of diabetes, the American Diabetes
Association (ADA) in 2009 published
updated standards for diabetes screening,
diagnosis, and therapeutic care (7). These
guidelines, which reflect new evidence
from epidemiological studies and random-
izedcontrolledtrials,includedtargetsforgly-
cemic control, blood pressure control, lipid
control, and smoking (7). The ADA recom-
mends that most adults with diabetes main-
tain an HbA1c
(a measure of blood glucose)
level below or around 7.0%, blood pressure
under 130/80 mmHg, and LDL cholesterol
under 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) (7). All pa-
tientswithdiabetesareadvisednottosmoke.
In addition, the National Cholesterol Educa-
tion Program Adult Treatment Panel III rec-
ommends that individuals with diabetes
keep their LDL under 100 mg/dL and total
cholesterol under 200 mg/dL (8).
Given that successful management of
diabetes requires a coordinated team of
health care providers (7) and access to
health insurance (9), continuity of care
(10), and patient knowledge and self-
management skills (11), there may be dif-
ferences in control of CVD risk factors
across sociodemographic groups within
the population of people with diabetes.
On the basis of data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2000, previous research-
ers reported that only 7.3% of those with
diagnosed diabetes achieve all three of the
ADA (2009) targets for control of blood glu-
cose, blood pressure, and total cholesterol
(12). Between the NHANES 1988­1994
and the NHANES 1999­2000, trends in
the control of blood cholesterol among in-
dividuals with diagnosed diabetes im-
proved, but there was no change in the
control of blood glucose and blood pressure
levels (12). Poor glycemic control generally
is more prevalent among African Americans
and Mexican Americans with diabetes com-
pared with non-Latino whites with diabetes

(13­15), but these differences have been
small in some studies (13) and limited to
certain sex/race-ethnicity subgroups in
other studies (14). Recent research based
on individuals with diabetes interviewed in
the NHANES 1999­2008 shows an overall
trend of improvement in CVD risk factors
and, notably, reductions in the predicted
10-year risk of coronary heart disease (16),
but some findings show that socioeconomic
status and racial/ethnic disparities persist
(14­18).
Using data from the NHANES 1988­
1994 and the NHANES 1999­2008, we
built on these important new results by 1)
examining trends in the prevalence of di-
agnosed diabetes and the sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of the diagnosed
diabetic population and 2) testing for
racial/ethnic- and education-related dis-
parities in poorly controlled risk factors
for CVD among individuals with diag-
nosed diabetes. Given the mounting body
of evidence showing the importance of
controlling CVD risk factors (7) and the
increasing focus on prevention in the
2010 health care reform law (19), it is
critical to document current trends in
the control of CVD risk factors among
individuals with diabetes and to examine
whether any improvements have been
concentrated in particular sociodemo-
graphic groups.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study population and analysis
samples
We used two samples, a sample from the
NHANES 1988­1994 and a sample from
the NHANES 1999­2008. The NHANES
used a stratified, multistage probability-
sampling frameandrepresentedthecivilian,
noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The
NHANES 1988­1994 interviewed 18,825
individuals aged $20 years. We limited
our NHANES 1988­1994 sample to 1,503
of these respondents who reported having
been diagnosed with diabetes. In the
NHANES 1999­2008, 26,246 individuals
aged $20 years were interviewed, and we
limited our NHANES 1999­2008 sample to
2,802 of these respondents who reported
having been diagnosed with diabetes.
Among those who reported having diabetes,
we further limited NHANES 1988­1994
and NHANES 1999­2008 samples to those
who had information regarding all four
CVD risk factors (blood glucose, blood
pressure, lipids, and current smoking).
Blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid
information are available only for those
NHANES respondents who participated
in the medical examination portion of the
survey, which included a blood draw.
Smoking information was obtained from
the interview.
These sample restrictions yielded 1,149
respondents in the NHANES 1988­1994
sample and 2,056 respondents in the
NHANES 1999­2008 sample. After ex-
cluding respondents with missing sociode-
mographic characteristics used in the
analysis, our final analysis samples included
1,065 respondents from the NHANES
1988­1994 and 1,872 respondents from
the NHANES 1999­2008. The main
racial/ethnic comparisons made were
between African Americans versus non-
Latino whites and Mexican-Americans
versus non-Latino whites. Latinos from
countries of origin other than Mexico are
included in the "other" race/ethnicity
category.
The age- and sex-adjusted proportion
of respondents with nonmissing informa-
tion on control of CVD risk factors de-
creased from 93.7% in the NHANES
1988­1994 to 81.1% in the NHANES
1999­2008. We tested for differences in
observed characteristics between those in-
cluded in the sample and those excluded
from the sample because of missing data. In
both the NHANES 1988­1994 and the
NHANES 1999­2008, minority individu-
als were overrepresented among missing
cases. In addition, in the NHANES 1999­
2008, those with less than a high-school
education were overrepresented among
missingcases. Whenwe ran a probitregres-
sion model with "missing from sample" as
the dependent variable, we found that in
both the NHANES 1988­1994 and in the
NHANES 1999­2008, the only statistically
significant predictor of being missing from
the sample was African American race. We
emphasize, however, that there is no sta-
tistically significant difference in the esti-
mated coefficient on African American race
in the NHANES 1988­1994 versus the
NHANES 1999­2008, suggesting that the
possible bias resulting from excluding ob-
servations with incomplete information is
likely to be minimal.
Definitions and measures
We considered an individual to have di-
agnosed diabetes if he or she answered "yes"
to the interview question, "Have you ever
been told by a doctor or health professional
that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?"
We did not consider respondents who re-
ported having gestational diabetes to have
diagnosed diabetes. When we estimated
the prevalence rates of diagnosed diabetes,
we used all respondents from the NHANES
1988­1994 and the NHANES 1999­2008
samples who provided a response to this
question.
To define poorcontrolofblood glucose
and blood pressure, we followed the ADA
2009 guidelines. We defined poor glycemic
controlusing abinaryindicatorof havingan
HbA1c
$7%. To define poor blood pres-
sure control, we used a binary indicator of
having a systolic blood pressure $130
mmHg or diastolic blood pressure $80
mmHg. The NHANES 1988­1994 medical
examination included three readings of sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure. For this
sample, we used the average of the second
and third readings. In the NHANES 1999­
2008, three or four blood pressure readings
were available for each respondent. Thus,
for this sample, we used the average of the
second and third readings when they were
both available, and we used the average of
the third and fourth measure or the average
of the second and fourth measure of blood
pressure in 193 case subjects for whom the
second or third measure of blood pressure
wasmissing and a fourth measure wasavail-
able. We defined a dichotomous indicator
of current smoking, which equaled 1 if a
respondent reported "yes" to the question,
"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in
your entire life?" and did not answer "not at
all" to the question, "Do you now smoke
cigarettes. . ." in the NHANES 1999­2008.
In the NHANES 1988­1994, we defined a
current smoker as someone who reported
"yes" to both "Have you smoked at least 100
cigarettes during your entire life?" and "Do
you smoke cigarettes now?"
To measure lipid control, we used the
total cholesterol level, which follows the
AdultTreatmentPanelIIIguidelines,instead
of LDL cholesterol, as suggested by the ADA
in 2009, because of the small sample sizes
with available LDL cholesterol information
in the NHANES (n = 335 in the NHANES
1988­1994, n = 785 in the NHANES 1999­
2008). The small sample sizes resulted from
the LDL cholesterol measurement only be-
ing available for those who were assigned a
NHANES medical examination scheduled
in the morning. We used a binary indicator
for total cholesterol of $200 mg/dL as an
indicator for poor lipid control.
Analyses
Initially, we examined trends in the prev-
alence of diagnosed diabetes and the
sociodemographic characteristics of the di-
agnosed diabetic populations in the

Disparities in CVD risk factors in diabetic individuals
NHANES 1988­1994 and the NHANES
1999­2008 samples. We reported age-
andsex-adjustedaswellasunadjustedprev-
alence rates of diagnosed diabetes (Table 1).
Standardization was based on the 2000 U.S.
Census population, using sex and age
(5-year age categories for those aged 20­
79 years and a category for those aged
$80 years). We then examined sample
characteristics of the population with
diagnosed diabetes in the NHANES
1988­1994 and the NHANES 1999­2008
(Table 2) and, in Table 3, estimated the
rates of poor control of CVD risk factors
in the NHANES 1988­1994 and the
NHANES 1999­2008 samples and by
racial/ethnic and education groups. In
Tables 2­3, the NHANES 1988­1994
percentages were standardized according
to the NHANES 1999­2008 population
of individuals with diagnosed diabetes,
using age-sex groups and their corre-
sponding weights (12). We compared the
rates of poor control of CVD risk factors
between the NHANES 1988­1994 and
the NHANES 1999­2008 (Table 3) (20).
We used logisticmodels estimated with
survey weights to test for racial/ethnic- and
education-related disparities in poorly con-
trolled risk factors for CVD among individ-
uals with diagnosed diabetes (Table 4). The
models included controls for race/ethnicity
(African American, Mexican American,
other race/ethnicity versus non-Latino
whites), age categories (5-year age catego-
ries for those aged 20­79 years and a cate-
gory for those aged $80 years), sex (female
vs. male), marital status (married vs. not
married), years since diagnosis of diabetes
(2­5, 6­10, 11­15, and $16 years vs. 0­1
years), obesity (BMI 25­29 kg/m2 [over-
weight], BMI $30 kg/m2 [obese] vs. BMI
,25 kg/m2 [normal]), access to routine
care (has routine access vs. does not have
routine access), health insurance type (pub-
lic, public and private, or uninsured vs. pri-
vate only), and indicators for survey year.

RESULTS
Trends in diagnosed diabetes and
characteristics of the population
with diagnosed diabetes
As others have reported (2,21), the prev-
alence of diagnosed diabetes has in-
creased appreciably over time (Table 1).
The age- and sex-standardized preva-
lence rate of diagnosed diabetes in the
NHANES 1999­2008 was 7.4%, whereas
it was 5.3% in the NHANES 1988­1994
(P , 0.001). The unadjusted prevalence
of diagnosed diabetes shows the same pat-
tern, increasing from 5.1% in the
NHANES 1988­1994 to 7.5% in the
NHANES 1999­2008 (P , 0.001), which
is consistent with previous research (22).
Between the NHANES 1988­1994 and
the NHANES 1999­2008, the incidence
of diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed)
increased from 7.9 to 10.1% (results not
shown). We found that among those with
diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed),
the rate of undiagnosed diabetes decreased
from 38.2 to 28.4% (results not shown),
suggesting that diagnosis has improved
over time.
One of the most significant changes in
the characteristics of the population with
diagnosed diabetes between the NHANES
1988­1994 and the NHANES 1999­
2008 is the race/ethnicity distribution.
Table 2 shows the increases over time in
the proportions of Mexican Americans
(from 5.9 to 8.0%, P = 0.10) and individ-
uals from the "other" race/ethnicity group
(from 6.0 to 12.2%, P = 0.002) in the
population with diagnosed diabetes,
whereas the proportion of non-Latino
whites declined (from 73.6 to 65.3%,
P = 0.009). For African Americans, there
is no statistically significant change be-
tween the NHANES 1988­1994 and the
NHANES 1999­2008 (Table 2).
The age distribution of the population
with diagnosed diabetes also changed be-
tween the NHANES 1988­1994 and the
NHANES 1999­2008 (Table 2). The pro-
portion of middle-aged individuals in-
creased over time (aged 40­59 years, from
34.5 to 41.6%, P = 0.01), whereas the pro-
portion of elderly individuals declined
(aged $60 years, from 55.6 to 49.5%, P =
0.03). This trend may have resulted from an
earlierdiagnosisofdiabetesand/oranearlier
onset of diabetes in recent years. In fact,
we found that mean age at the time of di-
abetes diagnosis is higher in the NHANES

1988­1994 than in the NHANES 1999­
2008 (aged 49.3 vs. 46.8 years, P ,
0.001), and the number of years since
diabetes was diagnosed was 9.1 years in
the NHANES 1988­1994 versus 11.4
years in the NHANES 1999­2008 (P ,
0.001).
In addition, the education profile of
individuals with diagnosed diabetes
changed remarkably between the NHANES
1988­1994 and the NHANES 1999­2008
(Table 2). The proportion of high-school
dropoutsamongindividualswithdiagnosed
diabetes decreased from 41.9 to 29.9%
(P = 0.001), whereas the percentage with
some postsecondary education increased
from 27.1 to 44.4% (P , 0.001). To some
extent, this change resulted from an
increasing level of education in the pop-
ulation as a whole. Between the NHANES
1988­1994 and the NHANES 1999­2008,
the age- and sex-standardized percentage
of NHANES respondents aged $20 years
with at least some postsecondary education
rose from 27.1% in the NHANES 1988­
1994 to 44.4% in the NHANES 1999­
2008 (P , 0.001). Finally, the population
with diagnosed diabetes has become
more obese over time, with obesity levels
increasing from 43.2% in the NHANES
1988­1994 to 54.8% in the NHANES
1999­2008 (P , 0.001). The percentage
of people who were either obese or over-
weight also increased between the NHANES
1988­1994 (81.3%) and the NHANES
1999­2008 (84.2%).
Trends in poor control of CVD
risk factors
Our findings suggest that control of CVD
risk factors among individuals with di-
agnosed diabetes has improved markedly
over the past two decades (Table 3). The
percentage of those with diagnosed dia-
betes not achieving glycemic control
(HbA1c
.7%) was 50.0% in the NHANES
1999­2008, an improvement from the
NHANES 1988­1994, when 57.7% of
people with diagnosed diabetes did not
meet this target (P = 0.008). The percent-
age of individuals with diagnosed diabe-
tes who do not achieve blood pressure
control ($130/80 mmHg) decreased
from 60.8% in the NHANES 1988­1994
to 53.5% in the NHANES 1999­2008
(P = 0.01). The percentage of people
with diagnosed diabetes who did not
have total cholesterol ,200 mg/dL also
significantly fell from 67.1% in the
NHANES 1988­1994 to 41.3% in the
NHANES 1999­2008. Rates of current
smoking among individuals with diag-
nosed diabetes, however, did not change
between the NHANES 1988­1994
(17.5%) and the NHANES 1999­2008
(18.1%, P = 0.81).
Of note, our analyses show a trend of
improvement not only in the control of
each risk factor individually but also in the
number of controlled risk factors. In the
NHANES 1988­1994, only 5.2% of those
with diagnosed diabetes had control of all
of the four risk factors we examined. In the
NHANES 1999­2008, however, 13.6% of
individuals with diagnosed diabetes had
control of all four risk factors (P , 0.001)
(results not shown). In addition, the per-
centage of people with diagnosed diabetes
who had control of three of four risk factors
increased from 24.1 to 31.0% (P = 0.003)
between the NHANES 1988­1994 and the
NHANES 1999­2008. Nevertheless, in the
NHANES 1999­2008, more than one-half
of the population with diagnosed diabetes
(54.4%) still had more than two uncon-
trolled risk factors (results not shown).
Racial/ethnic- and education-related
disparities in poor control
of CVD risk factors
In the NHANES 1988­1994, there were
no statistically significant racial/ethnic or
education-related disparities in glycemic
control among individuals with diag-
nosed diabetes, although some of the
CIs were wide (Table 4, Blood glucose col-
umn). In the NHANES 1999­2008, how-
ever, we found that African Americans
and Mexican Americans with diagnosed

Data are % (SE). Sample statistics in the NHANES 1988­1994 are standardized by age-sex adjusting to the
NHANES 1999­2008 diagnosed diabetes sample. The P values are derived from t tests that determine
whether the rates differ between the NHANES 1988­1994 and the NHANES 1999­2008. This table presents
broad age categories, but in the regression analyses and in the age/sex standardization of figures we used
5-year age intervals up to age 79 years.

Disparities in CVD risk factors in diabetic individuals
diabetes were ~50% more likely than non-
Latino whites with diagnosed diabetes to be
in poor glycemic control (African American
vs. non-Mexican white: odds ratio 1.52
[95% CI 1.14­2.03]; Mexican vs. non-
Mexican white: 1.53 [1.15­2.04]). Also, in
the NHANES 1999­2008, we found that
individuals with postsecondary education
were less likely to be in poor glycemic con-
trol compared with those without postsec-
ondary education (0.65 [0.48­0.89]). In
summary, our results indicate that although
glycemic control has improved in the
population of individuals with diagnosed
diabetes at large, these improvements may
have been, to some extent, concentrated
amongnon-Latinowhiteandmore-educated
individuals, such that new health dispar-
ities have emerged.
These racial/ethnic- and education-
related disparities in glycemic control per-
sisted when we limited the sample to the
most recent two waves of the NHANES
(2005­2006 and 2007­2008) (results not
shown). In these models, we tried includ-
ing covariates that may have captured
quality-of-care mechanisms of disparities,
specifically whether the respondent had
seen a diabetes specialist in the past year,
whether the respondent usually saw a par-
ticular doctor for diabetes, and whether the
respondent checked his or her own blood
glucose level. These additional variables are
available in the latest two waves of the
NHANES only. After these covariates
were included, both racial/ethnic-related
disparities and education-related dispari-
ties were not changed appreciably, suggest-
ing that these mechanisms (if they indeed
were capturing quality of care) did not ex-
plain the disparities we observed in recent
years. However, we interpreted these find-
ings with caution because the additional
covariates included may have captured
the severity of disease instead of or in addi-
tion to quality of care. In that case, there
may have been a reverse-causality problem,
with poor control of diabetes driving sever-
ity instead of the other way around.
We did not find racial/ethnic differ-
ences in blood pressure control among
individuals with diagnosed diabetes in
either the NHANES 1988­1994 or the
NHANES 1999­2008 (Table 4, Blood
pressure column). Individuals with diag-
nosed diabetes who had some postsec-
ondary education were less likely than
those without postsecondary education
to be in poor control of blood pressure,
but this association was statistically signif-
icant only in the NHANES 1999­2008
data. There were no racial/ethnic dispar-
ities in total cholesterol control among
individuals with diagnosed diabetes in
either the NHANES 1988­1994 or the
NHANES 1999­2008 (Table 4, Total cho-
lesterol column). The association between
postsecondary education and control of
cholesterol approached statistical signifi-
cance in the NHANES 1988­1994 but es-
sentially disappeared by the NHANES
1999­2008. In the case of smoking, post-
secondary education and Mexican American
ethnicity were associated with a lower risk
of smoking in the NHANES 1999­2008
(Table 4, Current smoking column; Mexi-
can American vs. non-Latino whites: odds
ratio 0.66 [95% CI = 0.44­0.97]; postsec-
ondary education vs. no postsecondary
education: 0.63 [0.42­0.95]). We did
not find these odds ratios in the NHANES
1988­1994; surprisingly, having 12 years
of education (compared with ,12 years)
is associated with a higher risk of smoking
in the NHANES 1988­1994, although the
CI is very wide for this estimate (Table 4,
Current smoking column; 2.34 [1.12­
4.87]).

The models in Table 4 focus on poor
control of CVD risk factors only among
individualswith diagnosed diabetes. Recent
work shows education-related disparities in
the likelihood of having undiagnosed di-
abetes in the NHANES 1999­2002 and
African American vs. non-Latino white
disparities in undiagnosed diabetes in the
NHANES 1988­1994 (23). Thus, as a sen-
sitivity check, we examined whether our
results on disparities were affected if we
considered undiagnosed cases. We reesti-
mated all of the models in Table 4, includ-
ing individuals with undiagnosed diabetes.
The general pattern of findings was similar
to those presented in Table 4. The only sig-
nificant change was that including undiag-
nosed individuals in the blood pressure
control models caused African American/
non-Latino white disparities to grow some-
what larger, reaching statistical significance
(results not shown).
CONCLUSIONSdIn the newly re-
leased Healthy People 2020, three objec-
tives in the area of diabetes are to improve
glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control
among individuals with diagnosed disease
(24). These objectives reflect mounting ev-
idence that the control of these risk factors
prevents CVD complications and mortality
among people with diabetes (7,25,26). In
addition, reducing smoking is a Healthy
People 2020 objective for all adults. Our
results show favorable trends in all of these
areas except smoking rates. Between the
NHANES 1988­1994 and the NHANES
1999­2008, the proportion of individuals
with diagnosed diabetes with poor glyce-
mic, blood pressure, and lipid control fell
by 13, 12, and 38%, respectively. The prev-
alence of current smoking among individ-
uals with diagnosed diabetes, however,
remained stable during the time period
we examined.
Our results suggest that, in some
areas, improvements in the control of
CVD risk factors seem to have benefit-
ted all racial/ethnic and education groups.
In the case of cholesterol levels, for ex-
ample, all racial/ethnic and education
groups experienced significant improve-
ments in control between the NHANES
1988­1994 and the NHANES 1999­2008.
In fact, we found no evidence of racial/
ethnic- or education-related disparities in
poor control of cholesterol in either the
NHANES 1988­1994 or the NHANES
1999­2008. In addition, there were no
racial/ethnic disparities in blood pressure
control in the NHANES 1988­1994 or the
NHANES 1999­2008.

Disparities in CVD risk factors in diabetic individuals
However, in the case of glycemic con-
trol, improvements over time may have been
driven by improvements among more edu-
cated individuals with diabetes and, to some
extent, by improvements among non-Latino
whites. Rates of poor glycemic control fell by
20% among those with .12 years of educa-
tion between the NHANES 1988­1994 and
the NHANES 1999­2008, but rates of gly-
cemic control remained stable during this
time period among those with less than a
high-school education. Results from our re-
gression analysis, which includes controls
for a number of confounding factors, suggest
that African Americans and Mexican Amer-
icans with diagnosed diabetes in the
NHANES 1999­2008 were 50% more likely
to have poor glycemic control than non-
Latino whites with diagnosed diabetes.
Moreover, in the NHANES 1999­2008,
individuals with diabetes who had at least
some college education were less likely to
have uncontrolled blood pressure than those
without any college education, controlling
for other factors. This association existed in
the NHANES 1988­1994 as well, but it was
not statistically significant. It also is notable
that smoking rates among individuals with
diagnosed diabetes have not improved over
time and remain high in some subgroups; in
the NHANES 1999­2008, 22% of individu-
als with diagnosed diabetes without a high-
schooleducationwerecurrentsmokers.This
high rate of smoking among the least edu-
cated individuals with diabetes is consistent
with other data (27).
In summary, our findings show that
important progress has been made in re-
ducing CVD risk factors among individuals
with diagnosed diabetes over the past de-
cade, but this progress, in some cases, has
been uneven across sociodemographic
groups. There are several potential reasons
why improvements in glycemic control may
have been concentrated among non-Latino
white and more educated populations. First,
some groups may have better access than
other groups to the type of integrated,
comprehensive medical care that individ-
uals with diabetes need in order to suc-
cessfully manage their illness. Although we
adjusted for insurance status and access to
routine care in our main regression models,
as well as experimented with models based
on the latest two waves of the NHANES that
included more extensive covariates, there
still may exist unmeasured aspects of quality
and access that are correlated with race/
ethnicity and education. Second, individ-
uals with diabetes who are more educated
may have been better able to obtain and
understand new information related to
diabetes treatment compared with individ-
uals with diabetes who are less educated. In
our sample limited to the 2005­2008
NHANES, 44% of individuals with diag-
nosed diabetes with more than a high-
school education reported that their doctor
recommended that they maintain an HbA1c
,7% (the recommended level), whereas
only 12% of respondents with less than a
high-school education reported that their
doctors recommended this level. There
also is evidence that people who are more
educated adopt medical technologies more
rapidly than people who are less educated
(28). Third, culture and language may
play a role in diabetes management practi-
ces, and these factors may underlie racial/
ethnic disparities in outcomes (11).
Although the mechanisms through
which sociodemographic characteristics af-
fect control of CVD risk factors are un-
clear, our findings underscore the need to
remediate these emerging racial/ethnic-
and education-related disparities in this area
of health care. Moreover, although our find-
ings show marked improvements in the
control of CVD risk factors among individ-
uals with diabetes, it also is true that only a
small group (13.6%) of individuals with
diagnosed diabetes in the NHANES 1999­
2008 had control of all four CVD risk factors
we examined. Continued public health ef-
forts need to be made to address the large
majority of individuals with diagnosed dia-
betes with uncontrolled risk factors for CVD.
