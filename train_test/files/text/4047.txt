Abstract: Corvids and primates have been shown to possess similar cognitive adaptations,
yet these animals are seldom tested using similar procedures. Object-choice tasks, which
have commonly been used to test whether an animal is able to infer the mental state of a
human experimenter based on a gestural cue, provide one potential means of testing these
animals using a similar paradigm. The current study used an object-choice task to examine
whether the corvid, Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), is able to use a cognitive
strategy to discriminate between the knowledge states of two human experimenters. One
experimenter was informed, and the other uninformed, as to the location of a food reward
hidden inside one of two opaque containers. During the Uninformed Gesture condition, the
nutcrackers were given probe tests during which only the person performing as the
uninformed experimenter provided a gesture. Thus, the nutcrackers could not use the
experimenter's gesture to reliably find the food. During the Gesture Conflict condition, the
nutcrackers were presented with a cue conflict. During probe tests, both the informed and
the uninformed experimenter gestured to separate containers. Thus, to find the food the
nutcrackers had to use the gesture from the informed experimenter and refrain from using
the gesture of the uninformed experimenter. Our results showed that when the uninformed
experimenter's gesture was presented alone, the birds continued to follow the gesture even
though it was not consistently predictive of the food's location. However, when provided
with two conflicting gestures, as a group the nutcrackers responded to the gesture of the
informed experimenter at above chance levels. These results suggest that the birds had
learned that the gesture was informative, perhaps by associative learning, yet when this
mechanism was not reliable the nutcrackers were able to use either the human
experimenters' presence/absence during the baiting process, or possibly their knowledge
states, to determine which gesture to rely upon.

Introduction
Research indicates that corvids may share many cognitive abilities with primates,
suggesting a convergent evolution of mental abilities (Emery and Clayton, 2004). These
cognitive similarities include many aspects of their social cognition. As evidence for their
complex social cognitive abilities, primates have been reported to take into account various
aspects of an observer to guide their own behavior, including: sensitivity to others'
attentional state (Flombaum and Santos, 2005; Hare, Call, Agnetta, and Tomasello, 2000;
Hare, Call, and Tomasello, 2006; Maclean and Hare, 2012; Santos, Nissen, and Ferrugia,
2006), knowledge state (Hare, Call, and Tomasello, 2001; Kaminski, Call, and Tomasello,
2008; Marticorena, Ruiz, Mukerji, Goddu, and Santos, 2011), or dominance status (Hare et
al., 2000, 2001). Likewise, research examining the caching-related behaviors of corvids has
shown these birds to be capable of similar social cognition. Corvids modify their caching
and retrieval behavior depending on whether or not they have been observed, both in
natural settings (Bugnyar and Kotrschal, 2002; Heinrich and Pepper, 1998; James and
Verbeek, 1983) and laboratory settings (Bugnyar, 2011; Bugnyar and Heinrich, 2005,
2006; Emery, Dally, and Clayton, 2004). When another individual is present, many corvids
will cache in areas where the observer would have reduced visual access to the cache
location, such as behind obstructions (ravens: Bugnyar and Kotrschal, 2002) or in shaded
areas (scrub jays: Dally, Emery, and Clayton, 2004). Ravens also preferentially cache when
an observer is distracted or inattentive (Heinrich and Pepper, 1998). Additionally, if
witnessed making a cache, corvids have been shown to re-cache their food when the
observing bird has left the area (scrub jays: Emery et al., 2004) or to preferentially retrieve
caches when a competitor is knowledgeable of the cache location (ravens: Bugnyar, 2011;
Bugnyar and Heinrich, 2005; Clark's nutcrackers: Clary and Kelly, 2011; scrub jays: Dally,
Emery, and Clayton, 2006). These strategies have been shown to be flexible as they are
differentially applied depending on the identity and dominance status of the specific
observer. Ravens, for instance, delay pilfering cached food in the presence of a dominant
caching bird (Bugnyar and Heinrich, 2006). Scrub jays show increased cache protection
when in the presence of dominant birds and preferentially engage in cache protection from
individuals that witnessed their caching (Dally et al., 2006). Furthermore, the cache
protection behaviors of scrub jays have been shown to depend on the initial acquisition of
experience as a pilferer, potentially representing a form of experience projection (Emery
and Clayton, 2001).
These findings suggest that corvids are sensitive to what other individuals see and
know, and also recognize that other individuals may have intentions to steal their food.
These cognitive skills may be similar to those shown by primates. However, research
investigating the complex social cognition abilities of corvids has primarily focused on the
domain of food caching (Grodzinski and Clayton, 2010), with few studies using the same
experimental procedures as those with primates. Thus, it is not clear whether the abilities
shown by corvids are indeed convergent to the abilities shown by primates or if they are
limited to food-caching contexts. If corvid social cognition is a more general process, then
corvids should be able to use these skills when challenged in non-ecologically relevant
contexts and tasks more commonly used to examine primate social cognition.

Object-choice tasks provide one approach for exploring whether the abilities shown
by corvids are in fact indicative of flexible cognitive processes (as opposed to associative
mechanisms). Typically, during the object-choice task, the subject is required to infer the
underlying knowledge state of a human experimenter through the use of the experimenter's
gestural cue to find a food reward hidden under an opaque container (e.g., primates: Byrnit,
2004; Call and Tomasello, 1994; Itakura and Anderson, 1996; Itakura and Tanaka, 1998;
Nieworth, Burman, Basile, and Lickteig, 2002; Peignot and Anderson, 1999; canids:
Soproni, Miklósi, Topál, and Csányi, 2002; Virányi et al., 2008; cetaceans: Pack and
Herman, 2004; Tschudin, Call, Dunbar, Harris, and van der Elst, 2001; bats: Hall, Udell,
Dorey, Walsh, and Wynne, 2011).
Recent studies have begun to examine corvid cognition using non-caching
procedures such as the object-choice task. However, results from using this approach have
been conflicted. Using a pointing cue, for example, Schloegl, Kotrschal, and Bugnyar
(2008) presented ravens with an array of five containers and a human experimenter pointed
to one previously baited container with his ipsilateral arm. The birds did not choose the
container being pointed to more often than if no cue was given. Conversely, von Bayern
and Emery (2009) showed that jackdaws were able to use a pointing cue. However, in this
study the experimenter extended the contralateral arm to indicate which of two containers
was baited. It is not known whether this seemingly subtle gestural difference may account
for these results. When non-avian species have been tested with both an ipsilateral and
contralateral gesture, the results indicate similar comprehension with either gestural form
(dogs: Soproni et al., 2002; dolphins: Pack and Herman, 2004; Herman et al., 1999; seals:
Shapiro, Janik, and Slater, 2003). If non-avian species are any indication, then the
difference between ravens and jackdaws represents a species difference for gesture use
rather than a methodologically driven difference.
Eye gaze has also been used as a directional cue during object-choice tasks with
corvids. Thus far, studies using static eye gaze have shown that corvids may not use this
cue to guide choices (ravens: Schloegl et al., 2008; rooks: Schmidt, Scheid, Kotrschal,
Bugnar, and Schloegl, 2011; jackdaws: von Bayern and Emery, 2009). However, studies
using alternating gaze have produced more accurate choice performance (jackdaws: von
Bayern and Emery, 2009; Clark's nutcrackers: Tornick, Gibson, Kispert, and Wilkinson,
2011).
Tornick et al. (2011) reported that Clark's nutcrackers were proficient at using a
variety of gestural cues (each examined independently) to find a food reward hidden in one
of two containers. The nutcrackers were able to use a touch gesture (a baited cup was
touched using the ipsilateral arm and picked up by the experimenter) and a pointing gesture
(the experimenter's ipsilateral arm and finger were directed to a baited cup) to locate the
food reward at above chance levels early in testing. With additional training, the
nutcrackers were also able to use eye gaze as a cue (the experimenter's eyes and head were
alternated between the bird and the baited cup).
In addition to being able to examine gesture use, the object-choice paradigm has the
potential for investigating whether animals can discriminate between experimenters with
different knowledge states (e.g., Povinelli, Nelson, and Boyson, 1990; Povinelli, Parks, and
Novak, 1991; Povinelli, Rulf, and Bierschwale, 1994). Povinelli et al. (1990) allowed
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana

chimpanzees to view a situation in which one experimenter witnessed a food reward being
hidden under an opaque container, whereas a second experimenter was not afforded this
experience. The two experimenters then gestured to one of the containers so that the
informed experimenter always indicated the correct container and the uninformed
experimenter an incorrect container before allowing the chimpanzee to make a choice. The
chimpanzees preferred the gesture of the informed experimenter. However, this preference
was not shown to be present for younger chimpanzees (Povinelli et al., 1994) or rhesus
monkeys (Povinelli et al., 1991).
Although corvids have been studied for their ability to use experimenter-given cues,
they have not been examined for their ability to use knowledge states during the object-
choice task (such as conducted by Povinelli et al., 1990). However, recent critiques of the
object-choice paradigm have posited that the original "mind-reading" interpretation of this
task are confounded by the alternative explanation that the animal need only to attend to the
experimenter's behavioral states to respond correctly (e.g., presence/absence or eye
orientation, see Povinelli and Vonk, 2003, 2004). This criticism is valid. However, the
object-choice task still requires an animal to make sophisticated social judgments and
therefore remains an informative procedure. We used the object-choice task as a way to
examine corvid cognition using a paradigm that is typically administered to primates, as
well as to present the birds with a social cognition problem outside of their ecological niche
of food caching. This affords the opportunity to examine whether corvid social cognition is
flexible or domain specific. Thus, the current study examined whether Clark's nutcrackers
are able to discriminate human experimenters based on their knowledge or behavioral states
during an object-choice task.
The experiment was conducted in two phases. During Phase 1, nutcrackers were
required to locate a hidden food reward by using a combined lookpointtouch gesture
(from here on referred to simply as "gesture") from both a familiar and a novel human
experimenter. Phase 1 was conducted to establish that the birds could learn the gesture that
would be used in Phase 2.
During Phase 2 of this experiment, the same nutcrackers were required to
discriminate between an informed and uninformed human experimenter, and use only the
gesture from the experimenter that was informed on any given trial to locate a hidden food
reward. Therefore, this modified object-choice task was used to examine whether
nutcrackers are sensitive to the knowledge state or behavioral state of the experimenter. If
the nutcrackers' cognitive abilities are indeed representative of flexible and complex
cognition, then they should be able to solve the social problem presented, despite the non-
ecologically relevant (i.e., non-caching) nature of the task.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Ten (five male and five female) wild-caught, sexually mature Clark's nutcrackers
(Nucifraga columbiana) were used in the experiment. Birds had been in captivity for 8-16
years and were housed in individual cages (73 cm high x 48 cm wide x 48 cm deep)
throughout the experiment. The birds were provided a diet consisting of turkey starter,
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -632-
parrot pellets, sunflower seeds, pine seeds, mealworms, oyster shells, and a vitamin
supplement. Each individual was food restricted to 85% of its ad libitum weight for the
duration of the experiment. All birds had previous experience with spatial and functional
lateralization tasks. The colony room maintained a 12:12 light-dark cycle with light onset at
07:00 and a temperature of 21
°C. All housing and experimental conditions were approved
by the local animal care committee and met the guidelines of the Canadian Council on
Animal Care.
Apparatus
Birds were tested in an experimental cage (66 cm high x 48 cm wide x 48 cm deep)
surrounded by curtains to create a uniform environment (200 cm long x 175 cm wide). The
experimental cage allowed the birds to make choices through two openings at the front of
the cage (see Figure 1). Birds could insert their heads through one opening at a time to
obtain a food reward from a container situated on a tray (51 cm long x 23 cm wide) outside
the cage. Two laterally positioned containers (8.5 cm diameter) were placed in this tray. A
swivel lid was attached to each of the containers such that the contents could be occluded.
To control for odor cues, each container had a layer of pine seeds along the bottom. The
rest of the volume was filled with grit so that a single pine seed could be placed on the
surface of the grit, in view of the test subject, when the container's swivel lid was open.
The tray was attached to a pulley system operated by an experimenter located outside of the
testing room. This system allowed the experimenter to pull the tray away from the cage
once the subject had made a choice. Each trial was viewed and recorded using a Sony Mini
DV digital videocassette recorder attached to an EverFocus 1/3" color digital camera
mounted on the ceiling above the test cage.
Procedures
Habituation. Prior to the experiment, the birds were given one container, filled with
grit and a food reward, in their home cages so that they could explore the container and
learn how to remove the lid to obtain the pine seeds inside. Once birds were readily
approaching and reliably opening the containers in their home cage, the birds were
individually placed in the experimental cage and allowed to select freely from the
containers which were placed flush against the two openings of the experimental cage with
the swivel lids opened. On the following 4 days the swivel lids were closed and the birds
were allowed to explore the containers and open the lids to retrieve a hidden pine seed from
each container. Once birds were consistently opening the containers in less than 30 seconds
they began participating in the experiment.

containers positioned laterally on the tray outside the cage.
Phase 1
i) Training. Training procedures for Experiment 1 were similar to those used by
Tornick et al. (2011). During training, birds received one daily session consisting of eight
trials (with sessions conducted Monday through Friday each week). During half of the trials
the gesture was performed by an experimenter familiar to the birds (herein referred to as
the "familiar experimenter"). The familiar experimenter had extensive history (~6 months)
both feeding and handling the birds. During the other half of the trials the gesture was
performed by an experimenter unfamiliar to the birds (herein referred to as the "novel
experimenter"). The birds had not encountered the novel experimenter prior to the
experiment. The trials were counterbalanced and pseudo-randomized so as not to have the
same experimenter gesturing during more than two consecutive trials. Familiar and novel
experimenters were used to assess whether the birds would show a preference for following
the communicative gesture of a known, as opposed to unknown, experimenter as shown by
von Bayern and Emery (2009).
During training, an experimenter entered the enclosure and stood at a central
location behind the tray. The experimenter then placed an opaque barrier against the front
of the bird's cage so that the bird could not see the experimenter who proceeded to bait one
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana

of the two containers. During half of the trials, the pine seed was placed in the left
container and during the other half of trials, in the right container. The container was baited
equally by the familiar and unfamiliar experimenter. The baited side was counterbalanced
across trials within each session and pseudo-randomized so that the seed was never baited
in the same container for more than two consecutive trials.
After baiting one of the containers from behind the barrier, the experimenter closed
both of the containers, removed the barrier, and proceeded to show the bird the contents of
each container, one at a time. To do so, the experimenter opened the lid of one of the
containers for three seconds (or until the bird looked at the open container), closed the lid,
and then proceeded to do the same for the other container. The location (left or right) of the
container that was opened first was counterbalanced across trials. After this presentation
the experimenter pushed the tray flush against the cage. The experimenter immediately left
the experimental room to allow the bird to make a choice in private. Birds were allowed to
make a single choice, which was defined by the bird making contact with either one of the
containers. If the bird chose the rewarded container it was allowed to obtain the seed before
the tray was pulled away. If the bird chose the unrewarded container, a 10-second blackout
ensued (experimental room lights extinguished) and the tray was pulled away from the
cage. After the bird's choice, a 30-second inter-trial interval was instituted. Once a bird was
reliably making a choice within 30 seconds or less, and this choice was correct during
seven of the eight trials for 5 consecutive days, the bird was presented with the testing
sessions.
ii) Testing. Testing was conducted over 20 days (with sessions conducted Monday
through Friday each week) with one session per day consisting of eight trials: six training
trials and two test trials. The procedures for the six training trials were exactly as described
above. The two test trials occurred randomly between trials two through seven (trials one
and eight were always training trials), but were never presented consecutively. One test
trial was conducted by the familiar experimenter, and the other test trial was conducted by
the novel experimenter. For each test trial, the experimenter baited one container as during
training. However, once the barrier was removed the experimenter gestured to the baited
container, which now had the swivel lid closed, by looking (orienting his head and eyes
towards the container), pointing (extending his ipsilateral arm towards container), and
touching (making contact with container using his finger tip). This gesture was held for 3
seconds or until the bird attended to the gesture by tilting its head in each direction to view
the situation with each eye. If the bird correctly chose the rewarded container, defined as
removing the swivel lid, it was allowed to retrieve the seed. However, if it chose the
unrewarded container the tray was pulled away. Unlike the training trials, blackout periods
were not presented for incorrect choices during testing to reduce the potential for
associative learning.
Phase 2
During Phase 2 the birds were challenged to use the knowledge states of two
experimenters simultaneously in order to find the reward. To accomplish this, we needed to
ensure that the birds were able to reliably use the gesture; therefore, during Phase 2 all of
the birds from Phase 1 were now explicitly trained to use the gesture. A new person was
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -635-
used as the novel experimenter during Phase 2.
i) Training. Birds were trained in three stages. During stage one, the training
procedures were the same as those of testing during Phase 1 with the exception that once
the barrier was removed the experimenter baited one of the containers in full view of the
bird. The experimenter then gestured to the open and baited container for 3 seconds before
the bird was allowed to make a choice. Once a bird made a correct choice during seven of
the eight trials for 2 consecutive days, the bird was presented with stage two.
Stage two was identical to stage one with the exception that after the container was
baited the experimenter closed both containers before gesturing to the baited container.
Once a bird made a correct choice during seven of the eight trials for 2 consecutive days,
the bird was presented with stage three.
During stage three the visual barrier was erected and from behind this barrier the
experimenter repositioned the containers so that they were vertically aligned on the tray (at
this point neither of the containers were baited; see Figure 2). This alignment prevented the
birds from being able to use the experimenter's arm position during the baiting process as a
reliable cue for the position of the baited container (see below). Once the containers were
aligned, the barrier was removed and the experimenter positioned a cardboard stand (28.5
cm x 45 cm) in front of the tray. This stand allowed the experimenter to bait one of the two
containers without the bird seeing which of the containers was baited. After the container
was baited, the experimenter moved both containers back to their lateral positions, removed
the cardboard stand, and proceeded to gesture to the baited container (the location of the
baited container now unknown to the bird). The tray was placed flush against the cage and
the experimenter left the room permitting the bird to make a choice in private. The bird was
allowed to retrieve the seed after making a correct choice, whereas an incorrect choice was
followed by a 10-second blackout period. Once a bird was reliably making a choice within
30 seconds or less, and this choice was correct during seven of the eight trials for 5
consecutive days, the bird was presented with the testing sessions.
ii) Testing. Testing was conducted over 16 days (with sessions conducted Monday
through Friday each week) with one session per day consisting of eight trials: six stage-
three training trials and two test trials. The procedures for the six training trials were
exactly as described above for stage three. The two test trials occurred randomly between
trials two through seven (trials one and eight were always training trials), but were never
presented consecutively. There were two testing conditions: the Uninformed Gesture
condition and the Gesture Conflict condition. One test trial of each condition was
administered during a daily session. Testing involved two knowledge states: the "Informed
Experimenter," during which the experimenter baited the container and therefore was
informed as to the location of the reward, and the "Uninformed Experimenter," during
which the experimenter was not involved in the baiting process and therefore uninformed
of the location of the reward. The familiar and novel experimenters performed both roles
equally often­i.e., the familiar experimenter acted as the Informed Experimenter and the
Uninformed Experimenter, and the novel experimenter also acted as the Informed
Experimenter and the Uniformed Experimenter. Thus, the birds could not use the identity
of the person to reliably find the food.

Figure 2. Stage 3 training during Phase 2
Notes: 1) Both containers placed centrally on the tray outside the cage. 2) A cardboard stand
was introduced to occlude bird's view of containers. 3) The containers were returned to the
lateral positions. 4) The cardboard stand was removed and the containers were placed in their
final locations prior to making the gesture.
During the Uninformed Gesture condition, the Informed Experimenter presented the
trial as in stage three, except after removing the cardboard stand the Informed Experimenter
left the experimental room and was replaced by the Uninformed Experimenter. Prior to this
point, the Uninformed Experimenter was in an adjacent room. The Uninformed
Experimenter gestured to a predetermined container; during half of the trials this container
was the rewarded one and during half of the trials it was the unrewarded one. The gesture
was held for 3 seconds after which the tray was pushed flush against the cage and the
experimenter left the room, allowing the bird to make a choice in private. This condition
allowed us to examine whether the birds would use the gesture information even when it
was uninformative, in which case the birds should follow the gesture of the Uninformed
Experimenter, or whether the birds would refrain from using the uninformative gesture and
either choose randomly between the two containers or adopt a side preference.
During the Gesture Conflict condition, the Informed Experimenter prepared the trial
as in stage three, except once the cardboard stand was removed the Uninformed
Experimenter also entered the enclosure. As in the Uninformed Gesture condition, the
Uninformed Experimenter was in an adjacent room during the baiting process. Both
experimenters proceeded to gesture (simultaneously) to a predetermined container. The
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -637-
Informed Experimenter gestured to the rewarded container whereas the Uninformed
Experimenter gestured to the unrewarded container. The gesture was held for 3 seconds,
after which the tray was pushed flush against the cage and both experimenters left the
room, allowing the bird to make a choice in private. In order to choose correctly, the bird
had to use some aspect of the experimenters' knowledge or behavioral states. Conversely,
choosing equally between the two experimenters would indicate that an associative process
guided the birds' choices, and that the associative learning gained from the training trials
supersedes any potential preference for an experimenter based on familiarity.
For both test conditions, if a bird chose the rewarded container it was allowed to
recover the seed prior to the tray being pulled away, whereas if the unrewarded container
was chosen the tray was pulled away (but no blackout period was administered) and a 30-
second inter-trial interval ensued.
Statistical analysis
For all analyses alpha was set at 0.05. Choice accuracy was analyzed using repeated
measures ANOVAs with Experimenter and Testing Blocks as variables. Although the
testing trials were conducted consecutively, for the purpose of analyses we divided them
into two equal blocks to examine any learning effects. One-sample t-tests were used to
compare the choice accuracy against chance (0.50).
Results
Phase 1
Eight birds progressed to testing after an average of 27 training days. Two birds
failed to reach training criterion after 60 days and did not progress to testing during Phase
1.
A repeated measures ANOVA examining choice accuracy with Experimenter
(Familiar and Novel) and Testing Blocks (1 and 2) did not show a main effect of
Experimenter (Familiar: M = 0.57, SE = 0.02; Novel: M = 0.61, SE = 0.05; F(1, 7) = 1.62, p
= 0.244), showing that the birds' accuracy was similar regardless of which experimenter
was performing the gesture. The birds' accuracy was also similar across Testing Blocks
(Block 1: M = 0.57, SE = 0.05; Block 2: M = 0.61, SE = 0.03; F(1, 7) = 0.61, p = 0.460).
Although choice accuracy was low, a one-sample t-test showed that the birds were
choosing the correct container significantly more than expected by chance, supporting that
the birds had learned to use the gesture (M = 0.59, SE = 0.03; t(7) = 2.59, p = 0.044).
Phase 2
Four birds met the training criterion after an average of 43.5 days of stage three
training, and therefore progressed to testing. The remaining six birds did not meet the
training criterion after 85 training days, and did not progress to testing.
Uninformed Gesture condition. A repeated measures ANOVA examining choice
accuracy with Experimenter (Familiar and Novel) and Testing Blocks (1 and 2) did not
show a main effect of Experimenter (Familiar: M = 0.84, SE = 0.06; Novel: M = 0.84, SE =
0.03; F(1, 3) = 0.00, p = 1.000), showing that the birds' accuracy was similar regardless of
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana

which experimenter was performing as the Uninformed Experimenter. The birds' accuracy
was also not significantly different across Testing Blocks (Block 1: M = 0.78, SE = 0.06;
Block 2: M = 0.91, SE = 0.03; F(1, 3) = 6.00, p = 0.092).
The nutcrackers followed the Uninformed Experimenter's gesture at above chance
levels (M = 0.84, SE = 0.04; t(3) = 8.52, p = 0.003). The birds' choice accuracy during the
Uninformed Gesture Condition was not significantly different from training trials (test
trials: M = 0.84, SE = 0.04; training trials: M = 0.93, SE = 0.01; t(3) = -1.82, p = 0.177).
Individually, three of four birds used the gesture at above chance levels (Sid: 13/16 trials,
0.81, binomial: p = 0.02; George: 14/16 trials, 0.88, binomial: p = 0.004; Tanthalas: 15/16
trials, 0.94, binomial: p = 0.001) and one bird missed significance by one response (Tasha:
12/16 trials, 0.75, binomial: p = 0.08; see Figure 3). Thus, the birds continued to rely on the
experimenter's gesture to guide their choices despite the gesture not providing reliable
information as to the goal's location.

0.62, SE = 0.09; F(1, 3) = 0.32, p = 0.608), showing that the birds' accuracy was not
significantly different depending on which experimenter was performing as the Informed
Experimenter. The birds' accuracy was also similar across Testing Blocks (Block 1: M =

0.62, SE = 0.01; Block 2: M = 0.53, SE = 0.07; F(1, 3) = 0.32, p = 0.608).
Figure 4. Comparison of each bird's choice accuracy and overall choice accuracy to
chance responding during the Gesture Conflict condition
Note: * p < 0.05
Overall, the nutcrackers chose the Informed Experimenter's gesture significantly
more often than would be predicted by chance (M = 0.58, SE = 0.02; t(3) = 5.00, p = 0.015)
and this choice accuracy was not significantly different across Testing Blocks (Block 1: M
= 0.66, SE = 0.06; Block 2: M = 0.50, SE = 0.09; t(3) = 1.06, p = 0.377). During Block 1,
the birds' performance was above chance, albeit not significantly (t(3) = 2.61, p = 0.08),
whereas during Block 2, the birds' performance declined to chance levels (t(3) = 0.00, p =
1.000). Three of the four birds chose the Informed Experimenter's gesture on the first trial
(Sid, George, and Tanthalas). Individually, however, none of the nutcrackers chose the
Informed Experimenter's gesture significantly greater than chance overall (Sid, Tanthalas,
and Tasha: 9/16 trials, 0.56, binomial: p = 0.80; George: 10/16 trials, 0.62, binomial: p =
0.454; see Figure 4). Choice accuracy remained very high on training trials (M = 0.93, SE
= 0.01; t(3) = 32.97, p < 0.001).
Discussion
Gesture use
Learning to reliably use the gestures from two experimenters was clearly a difficult
task for the nutcrackers as only four of the 10 birds were able to acquire the training
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -640-
criterion during Phase 2. The birds showed that they could use the gesture at above chance
levels from Phase 1, but many of the birds could not improve this accuracy in order to
achieve the accuracy criterion needed for Phase 2 testing. This finding seems to be at odds
with those recently reported by Tornick et al. (2011). The nutcrackers in this previous study
learned to use gestural cues to locate a food reward quickly and effectively, whereas the
majority of our birds were unable to learn to use the human-based gesture despite being
explicitly trained to follow the gesture through additional training trials and the
implementation of correction procedures after incorrect choices.
Several procedural differences were introduced in our study (e.g. combined gesture,
multiple experimenters) compared to that of Tornick et al. (2011), which may account for
some of the differences in gesture learning. The results of our study do not support the
likelihood that the nutcrackers were learning to use the gesture cue through local
enhancement strategies (Tornick et al., 2011; Schloegl et al., 2008). Tornick et al.
suggested that this simpler strategy may have accounted for subjects' superior performance
with pointing and touch cues over eye gaze because these cues reduce the distance between
the cue and the goal location. However, in our current study, both the point and touch cue
of our gesture were presented together and offered no distance between the cue and the
container, yet the nutcrackers struggled to learn to follow the gesture. Thus, even though
we increased the physical contact with the rewarded container, arguably increasing local
enhancement, the nutcrackers were not able to use this local information to improve choice
behavior. Alternatively, Mulcahy and Hedge (2012) have suggested that primates (and
possibly the nutcrackers in the current experiment) struggle in the object choice task
because of their proximity to the choice containers, which interferes with the subject's
ability to attend to the experimenter's cue.
It has been proposed that early developmental experience with humans may explain
the successful use of human-given gestures in some species (e.g., bats: Hall et al., 2011;
Canids: Udell and Wynne, 2010; Udell, Dorey, and Wynne, 2010; scrub jays: von Bayern
and Emery, 2009). This hypothesis might explain the difficulty the nutcrackers had in
learning to reliably use the gesture. However, this would not explain the contradictory
results of Tornick et al. (2011) and our experiment, as the birds in these studies were wild-
caught as adults and experienced similar laboratory environments and experimental
histories.
Knowledge states
The birds that did proceed to testing after learning the gesture tended to use the
gestural information from the Uninformed Experimenter during the Uninformed Gesture
condition. This suggests that when the birds did learn the gesture, the use of this gesture
was robust and persisted even when it did not provide reliable information as to the
reward's location. However, when the gestures from the two experimenters provided
conflicting information as to the location of the rewarded container, overall the birds chose
the Informed Experimenter more often than would be expected by chance, showing that
they were able to distinguish between the two experimenters.
The birds could have made this discrimination by either using the experimenters'
knowledge states (i.e., informed and uninformed) or behavioral states (i.e., presence and
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -641-
absence; Povinelli and Vonk, 2003, 2004). The birds' choices did not seem to be driven by
an associative process during the Gesture Conflict condition, since the birds showed
discrimination despite receiving equivalent reinforcement from both experimenters during
training. Additionally, the birds' performance was better during the first block of testing
(albeit not significantly) with three of the four birds choosing correctly on the first trial,
suggesting that the birds were not using a learned rule to solve the task. Using behavioral
states would likely require the learning of such a rule, as by itself the behavioral state is not
immediately informative unless linked to a knowledge state (e.g., presence during an event
leads to an informed knowledge state) and would not explain the first block performance.
The birds' behavior was not affected by an experimenter's absence during baiting,
as shown by their reliance on the gesture during the Uninformed Gesture condition.
Therefore, it seems unlikely that the birds avoided choices to the Uninformed Experimenter
during the Gesture Conflict condition simply due to this experimenter's initial absence
during baiting. Instead, the birds used some other aspect of the Informed Experimenter,
either his presence during baiting, thus facilitating a greater association between that
experimenter and the food, or his informed knowledge state, allowing the bird to reason
that the experimenter "knew" the food's location. At this point, we cannot clearly
dissociate these two alternative explanations, yet it seems that the information provided by
the Informed Experimenter was used most for the birds' choices.
Flexible cognition?
To determine whether corvid social cognition is a flexible ability, we argue that it is
important to challenge corvids in non-ecologically relevant tasks, which is a reason for
choosing the object-choice task in the current study. Researchers have expressed concern
over using tasks that are low in ecological validity (e.g., Tomasello, Call, and Hare, 2003).
However, examining species in both ecologically relevant and non-ecologically relevant
contexts can reveal the potential, and equally as important, the limits of a given species'
cognitive abilities. Furthermore, when used with multiple species, this approach can
elucidate how the underlying mechanism responsible for the animal's behavior (i.e.,
associative and/or cognitive processes) vary in relation to phylogeny, and thus, how
cognitive abilities may have developed over evolutionary time (see also Vonk and Subiaul,
2009).
Overall, the nutcrackers chose the gesture of the Informed Experimenter despite a
number of components of the task that could be considered non-ecologically relevant.
Aside from explicitly testing the birds outside of a food-caching context, the experiment
also required the birds to use the gestures of a distantly-related species. Kaplan (2011)
documented how Australian magpies "point" referentially by aligning their body, both
horizontally and vertically, toward a predator. Therefore, the important feature of avian
gestural exchanges may be body orientation, an aspect not manipulated in this experiment.
Considering the different forms that the gestures of primates and birds take (e.g., beak
versus limb pointing), the nutcrackers may have had difficulty recognizing that a referential
gesture was being presented. This would explain the difficulty the birds experienced during
training with a human gesture. Additionally, combining different task components (e.g.,
gesture use, multiple experimenters, using knowledge states) likely would have increased
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -642-
the task's difficulty, an idea proposed by Call and Tomasello (1999), who suggested the
object-choice task is difficult in that "the subject is asked to master both the logistics of the
task and to display an understanding of other minds at the same time" (p. 382).
Object-choice tasks have also been argued to be a cooperative task (Hare, 2001),
which may be less ecologically relevant and consequently less intuitive for a relatively non-
social species like the Clark's nutcracker. Clary and Kelly (2011) made a similar argument
when describing the different cache protection strategies nutcrackers use compared to
social species. After experiencing cache theft, nutcrackers were found to decrease the
number of caches made over time, the opposite pattern of the more social Western scrub-
jay (Emery et al., 2004), which increased caching behavior after experiencing pilferage.
Thus, the authors suggested that nutcrackers view caching interactions as competitive,
whereas social species view them as cooperative. If less social species view social
interactions as competitive, this may explain why the majority of the nutcrackers had
difficulty consistently following the cooperative communicative gesture during our current
study (see also Hare and Tomasello, 2004; Herrmann and Tomasello, 2006). This could
explain the above chance, yet low accuracy performance of the nutcrackers in Phase 1 and
the inability of many birds to achieve maximum accuracy in Phase 2.
Convergent evolution
Specifically because the object-choice task is difficult and non-ecologically relevant
for corvids (perhaps especially so for less social species), the evidence that corvids can
succeed in these tasks is particularly revealing as to the extent of their cognitive
capabilities. The results presented here highlight the potential flexibility and complexity
underlying nutcracker cognition. If the nutcrackers are capable of making judgments about
the mental states of others in this difficult context (although strictly speaking, a behavioral
account cannot be excluded­see Penn and Povinelli, 2007), then it is possible, although
speculative, that these birds are using these abilities proficiently in natural situations (e.g.,
during caching interactions) and are examples of complex cognition.
Unlike nutcrackers' ability to interpret human gestures, using knowledge states may
be an ecologically relevant skill for corvids and represents a convergence of mental
abilities with primates, as the circumstances leading to knowledge acquisition are likely
similar (e.g., presence during events leads to informed knowledge states; corvids: Bugnyar,
2011; primates: Hare et al., 2001) and not necessarily cache dependent. The nutcrackers
may have been able to use the experimenter's knowledge state, but were not proficient in
using the gesture because the birds could not easily extract the information conveyed due to
the divergent forms of avian and human (primate) gestures. Therefore, although it seems
that the nutcracker's ability to generalize gestural forms of communication is limited, their
social cognitive processes may be more easily generalized to non-ecologically relevant
(i.e., non-caching) contexts.
Our investigation provides an initial step in testing corvids in social cognition tasks
more typically utilized with primates. This study indicates that nutcrackers may share with
chimpanzees the ability to discriminate between experimenters based on whether the
experimenter had previously baited a container and possibly evaluate some aspects of the
knowledge states of other individuals­further suggesting that the similarities in behavior
Human knowledge state discrimination in Nucifraga columbiana

and cognition between corvids and primates represents evidence for convergent evolution.
