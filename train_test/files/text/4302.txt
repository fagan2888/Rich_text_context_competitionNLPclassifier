Abstract: Although much recent attention has focused on identifying domain-specific
taxonomic differences in cognition, little effort has been directed towards
investigating whether domain-general differences also exist. We therefore conducted
a meta-analysis of published nonhuman primate cognition studies, testing the
prediction that some taxa outperform others across a range of testing situations. First,
within each of nine experimental paradigms with interspecific variation, we grouped
studies by their procedures and the characteristics of their study subjects. Then, using
Bayesian latent variable methods, we tested whether taxonomic differences
consistently held within or across paradigms. No genus performed especially well
within particular paradigms, but genera differed significantly in overall performance.
In addition, there was evidence of variation at higher taxonomic levels; most notably,
great apes significantly outperformed other lineages. These results cannot be readily
explained by perceptual biases or any other contextual confound and instead suggest
that primate taxa differ in some kind of domain-general ability.
Keywords: intelligence, modularity, Bayesian analysis, great apes.

Introduction
A major goal for many comparative psychologists of previous generations
was to identify taxonomic differences in overall intelligence (e.g., Köhler, 1925;
Warden, 1951; Harlow, 1958; Bitterman, 1965). Few current workers, however,
believe it is still profitable to pursue this line of research. For one thing, there is now
compelling evidence that individuals possess many distinct cognitive abilities,
including specific types of learning, memory, and timing (e.g., Sherry & Schacter,
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 150 -
1987; Gallistel, 2000). In addition, investigators taking a comparative evolutionary
approach have identified domain-specific abilities that were apparently selected to
increase an animal's fitness in its taxon-typical environment (e.g., Rozin, 1976;
Kamil, 1988; Shettleworth, 1998).
Although the notion of ranking taxa on a uni-dimensional scale of intelligence
is flawed, there could be instances where one taxon possesses better domain-general
cognition than another. Specifically, although taxon A might share many abilities
with taxon B or lack some of B's domain-specific abilities, if A possessed an ability
or abilities that allowed it to excel in a wide variety of contexts requiring behavioral
flexibility (cf. fluid intelligence: Cattell, 1971), the claim of some sort of domain-
general cognitive difference would be appropriate. Demonstrating the existence of
such a difference will clearly be difficult, but we suggest that progress can be made
with the following steps: (1) focusing on a taxonomic group where species have
similar motor and sensory capacities; (2) considering all paradigms (i.e., general
kinds of problems) where interspecific variation has been identified; (3) and testing
whether some taxa consistently perform better than other ones across the paradigms.
This meta-analysis approach has two important advantages. First, it largely
resolves the performance-ability conundrum (i.e., the fact that performance
differences may arise because animals differ in motivation, adaptability to the testing
situation, or ability or preparedness to perceive or respond to the experimental
stimuli: Bitterman, 1965; Warren, 1974; MacPhail, 1982). If the same taxonomic
difference is found in a range of situations, the likelihood diminishes that the
differences merely reflect a particular testing variable (Kamil, 1988). Second,
considering performance in a number of paradigms explicitly addresses the issue of
domain-generality: if one taxon truly has better domain-general cognition than
another, it should perform better in a variety of unrelated situations. In contrast,
investigations attempting to test for uni-dimensional intelligence have often searched
(unsuccessfully) for a single "holy grail" paradigm (Schrier, 1984).
Here we apply this approach to the order primates, a group that is ideal for
three reasons. First, much relevant information has already been collected, meaning
that it is possible to conduct an analysis with a reasonable degree of statistical power.
Second, despite all of the research, there are few demonstrations of taxon-specific,
domain-limited cognitive abilities in primates (e.g., Platt, Brannon, Briese, & French,
1996; Stevens, Hallinan, & Hauser, 2005). The paucity of such demonstrations (if
truly indicating few specializations), should increase the possibility of detecting
domain-general differences, the existence of which has been repeatedly suggested in
primates (e.g., Köhler, 1925; Jolly, 1966; Parker & Gibson, 1977; Byrne, 1995; van
Schaik, Deaner, & Merrill, 1999; Reader & Laland, 2002). Third, although primates
are behaviorally diverse, most taxa are highly dependent on visual processing and
possess considerable manual coordination. Hence, the same testing procedures should
be applicable for most subjects.
Several previous studies have surveyed primate cognition and reached a range
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 151 -
of answers to the question of whether there are overall taxonomic differences across
paradigms (e.g., Rumbaugh, 1970; Ehrlich, Fobes, & King, 1976; Tomasello & Call,
1997). The divergent conclusions can be attributed to the fact that none of the surveys
have been performed systematically. In particular, they combined data that were
collected with substantially different procedures, compared subjects of differing ages
and experience, and based their overall conclusions on qualitative impressions, rather
than statistical tests.
Therefore, in the present study, we (1) attempt to exhaustively search the
literature for all relevant data, (2) restrict comparisons to subjects with similar
backgrounds and studies conducted with extremely similar procedures, (3) use
explicit criteria for deciding if there is a taxonomic difference within a type of study
procedure, and, finally, (4) employ a recently developed hierarchical Bayesian model
(Johnson, Deaner, & van Schaik, 2002) to test if taxa perform especially well across
all paradigms or instead excel in particular paradigms. By systematically addressing
these issues in a well-studied lineage, this paper provides a strong test of the
hypothesis that there are taxonomic differences in domain-general cognition.
Materials and Methods
We began by searching published reviews of primate cognition (e.g.,
Rumbaugh, 1970; Ehrlich et al., 1976; Fobes & King, 1982; King & Fobes, 1982;
MacPhail, 1982; Tomasello & Call, 1997), looking for indications of inter-specific
variability within experimental testing paradigms that were deemed relevant to issues
of "learning", "cognition", or "intelligence". We eliminated from consideration
paradigms where animals were not rewarded for their performance because, in this
situation, poor performance could be indicative of an animal being unmotivated or
misunderstanding the experimenter's expectations. Examples of this are
investigations of object manipulation, gaze-following, and mark tests of "self
recognition" (see Tomasello & Call, 1997).
After identifying potentially useful paradigms, we went to the relevant
research articles, searched these for other relevant citations and then repeated the
process several times. We also employed the "PsychLit" computer database,
searching with several keywords relevant to each paradigm. For instance, for the
reversal learning paradigm we considered all articles that contained this phrase,
"transfer learning", or "intra-dimensional shift learning." Although we attempted to
exhaustively search the relevant literature, our survey is likely biased towards reports
in English. We completed our literature survey in February of 2001.
A variety of procedures have been used to investigate most paradigms. For
example, some studies of object discrimination learning sets employ six trials per
problem, whereas others administer trials until a criterion level of performance is
reached. In most cases, procedural differences are known or expected to affect
performance. Thus, we only pooled data from separate studies if they were conducted
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 152 -
with extremely similar or identical procedures. Rather than rating one type of study
procedure as better than the others, we retained data from all suitable procedures.
Therefore, for most paradigms, several separate taxonomic rankings were obtained.
We refer to these separate taxonomic rankings as procedure rankings within
paradigms.
To make statistical treatment more tractable, and because most behavioral
variation in primates occurs at higher-order taxonomic levels (e.g., Harvey, Martin, &
Clutton-Brock, 1987), we used the genus, rather than the species, as the minimal
taxonomic unit. The data on the various macaque species, for example, were all
grouped into Macaca. Because most proposed differences occur at even higher-order
taxonomic levels than the genus, we also conducted some analyses after placing
genera into the following groups: prosimians (Eulemur, Galago, Lemur, Microcebus,
Nycticebus, Phaner, Varecia), New World monkeys (Aotus, Ateles, Callithrix, Cebus,
Lagothrix, Saimiri), Old World monkeys (Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, Macaca,
Mandrillus, Miopithecus, Papio, Presbytis), lesser apes (Hylobates) and great apes
(Gorilla, Pan, Pongo). To further keep the study manageable in scope, we only
considered paradigms where comparisons involved at least three genera. In several
cases, a single procedure only allowed a comparison between two genera, but this
information was included if there were other procedures within the paradigm. Thus, if
there were two procedures within a paradigm and both involved comparing two taxa,
we retained data from both procedures.
Taxonomic comparisons would ideally occur among a random sample of
subjects that each had species-typical rearing histories, similar maturity levels,
motivation, and experience relevant to the testing situation. Towards this end, we
took the following steps. First, we omitted subjects that were drawn from a larger
pool because they were thought to have unusually poor or excellent abilities. Second,
we omitted all subjects that were reared in social isolation or had undergone
neurosurgery (although control subjects from neurosurgery studies were considered).
We did not omit great ape subjects that had extensive language or symbolic training
because there is no indication that this experience affects performance on tasks
involving non-social cognition (Call & Tomasello, 1996), and all data were drawn
from non-social paradigms. Third, we excluded infants, operationally defined as
animals whose age at testing was indicated to be less than 1/5 the age at first
reproduction (AFR; data from Ross & Jones, 1999). In most great apes, for example,
this corresponds to less than about two years, whereas in most Old World monkeys it
corresponds to less than about one year. Because performance may improve
considerably after 1/5 AFR (e.g., delayed response: Harlow, Uehling, & Maslow,
1932; Maslow & Harlow, 1932; object discrimination learning sets: Fobes & King,
1982; patterned-string problems: Mason & Harlow, 1961), we also repeated all tests
after excluding animals that were less than 1/2 AFR. In many studies, ages were not
provided: to be conservative, if no information was available or if subjects were
described as "juveniles", "immatures", or "adolescents", we considered them to be at
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition

least 1/5 AFR but less than 1/2 AFR; if animals were described as "late adolescents",
"late juveniles", "subadults" or "adults", we considered them to be at least 1/2 AFR.
Fourth, we frequently omitted subjects that were known to differ from others in
experience known to be relevant to the task (see Appendix A). Fifth, one study was
omitted where investigators noted that animals were not tested with a favored or
preferred food (Riopelle & Moon, 1968). Finally, in one case, we omitted subjects
that did not attempt to solve the problem (Davis & Leary, 1968).
In ranking genera within procedures, we had to consider two opposing
concerns. On one hand, we did not wish to rank one genus over another based on
extremely small performance differences, because such differences are likely to
reflect various sorts of error, rather than intrinsic differences. On the other hand,
because most studies employed modest sample sizes, if we only assigned rankings
when taxa differed significantly or dramatically, there would be very little data left to
analyze. In an effort to balance these two concerns, we used the following guidelines.
For qualitative comparisons, we considered taxa to be different if they met
either of two criteria. First, at least half of the subjects of one taxon performed
positively (i.e., met some qualitative distinction), and none of the subjects of the other
taxon performed positively; there had to be a minimum of two subjects in the taxon
with no positive performance. Second, all subjects of one taxon performed positively,
and less than half of the subjects of the other taxon performed positively; there had to
be a minimum of two subjects in the taxon with all positive performance.
We also used two criteria for making quantitative distinctions. First, in cases
where there was a single relevant performance measure, either the original
investigators or we had to demonstrate statistically significant taxonomic variation.
For establishing taxonomic variation within study procedures, we set significance at
 = 0.05 and used two-tailed tests. Second, in procedures where multiple measures
were available, we sought evidence of significant taxonomic variation in at least one
measure or consistent taxonomic variation across all measures (i.e., one taxon doing
better than others did across all types of problems, or problem blocks).
Employing these quantitative criteria was sometimes difficult because in
procedures where data were available for three or more taxa, there were often
problems of intransitivity in significance or consistency. For instance, genus A might
have a significantly (or consistently) higher overall mean score than genus C but only
a slightly (and non-significantly) higher score than genus B; genus B, however, might
not have a significantly higher score than genus C. We generally resolved
intransitivities by assuming that once significant or consistent overall variation had
been demonstrated across all taxa, all differences among taxa were meaningful. So, in
this example, we would rank genus A first, genus B second, and genus C third, rather
than considering them all tied or representing the information in some other way.
Another complication was that in some cases where overall taxonomic variation was
demonstrated among three or more taxa, two taxa might differ on measures that could
not be quantitatively collapsed. For instance, one taxon might score higher score on
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 154 -
one problem type, the other taxon might score higher on another, and collapsing the
scores into some sort of grand mean would be unjustified. In such cases, we generally
regarded the taxa as tied. In the specific procedures where this issue arose, it is
addressed in more detail.
The sample: paradigms, procedures and rankings
This section briefly describes and reviews each of the paradigms employed.
Under each paradigm are subsections providing details on each of the procedures that
allowed taxonomic rankings. We attempt to provide enough detail on each procedure
to give a flavor for the research and to make clear the reasoning for the grouping the
studies as we did. In doing so, we make it possible to repeat this study using slightly
different decision rules.
Within each procedure, we list the number of subjects for each genus that
were considered to be at least 1/5 AFR. We also note whether they participated in
other studies included in the data set, allowing us to address the possible impact of
pseudo-replication. We generally do not discuss subjects' pre-training or prior
experience because, if it differed substantially from that of others within the
procedure, the exceptional subjects were excluded or grouped with other, similarly
experienced subjects in other procedures. We state the criteria used in ranking the
genera and the evidence that indicated meaningful taxonomic variation. For
quantitative measures, we only provide details of statistical tests if there was no
documentation of meaningful variation in the original publications. We also note if
any subjects were excluded because of evidence of poor motivation. Finally, we note
if comparisons could be made among subjects greater than 1/2 AFR. The overall
rankings for all procedures across all paradigms are presented in table 1.
Despite the details presented above, there may still be questions regarding
why we did not include particular studies in the analysis. To more fully explain these
decisions, we have provided two appendices. Appendix A discusses particular studies
that do fit within the paradigms we employed but that, nevertheless, could not be
incorporated in our analysis. Generally, these studies could not be used because they
did not provide data on multiple taxa, did not reveal significant taxonomic variation,
or, because of procedural differences, could not be combined with other studies
within their paradigm. Appendix B lists paradigms from which researchers have
drawn, or might consider drawing, taxonomic distinctions and clarifies why these
paradigms could not be included in our sample. Appendices A and B are not intended
to serve as a comprehensive guide to all primate cognition studies that were not
included; they are meant only to clarify our decision making for the studies about
which readers are most likely to be curious.

Detour Problems
Detour problems investigate the ability to form and act on spatial
representations. Although detour problems frequently focus on subjects' locomotion
through mazes, primates have mainly been investigated on problems where they are
required to manually move an object through a spatial field that contains one or more
obstacles.
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition

procedure 1. Davis, McDowell, & Nissen (1957) tested seven Pan and 16
Macaca on problems where a preferred food was impaled on a bent wire. For
instance, in one problem the subject had to first move the food to her right before
pulling it towards her, whereas in another problem, the subject had to move the food
to her left and then push it away from her. There were 40 different kinds of bent wire
problems in all. Across all problem blocks and all problem types, Pan performed
better than Macaca, and hence was ranked lower (i.e., superior). Because no data
were presented on Macaca that were greater than 1/2 AFR, this study only applies to
greater than 1/5 AFR analyses.
procedure 2. McDowell & Nissen (1959) tested 24 Macaca and five Pan in a
series of problems where subjects worked to free a food-containing stylus. (Most
subjects had participated in procedure 1.) The stylus was positioned behind a short
ladder, so that it could only be obtained by alternately using two hands to bring the
stylus to the top of the ladder. On all variations of the problem, Pan performed better
than Macaca and hence was ranked lower. All subjects were greater than 1/2 AFR.
procedure 3. Davis & Leary (1968) tested 19 Macaca, two Cercopithecus,
four Cebus, four Lagothrix, four Lemur and seven Saimiri on three kinds of bent wire
detour problems (similar to procedure 1). Data were presented on mean success rate
at seven separate time blocks, for each species. After calculating weighted mean
scores for all Macaca (three species were included), we used analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) on the log-transformed test scores to confirm that there was significant
variation across genera across time blocks (F(10,24) = 5.40; p < 0.0005). We then
calculated a grand mean for each genus and ranked them from lowest to highest, as
follows: Macaca, Cercopithecus, Lagothrix, Cebus, and Lemur. We omitted Saimiri
from the rankings because most subjects did not attempt to solve the problem.
Because the subjects' ages were not provided, this study was only incorporated in the
greater than 1/5 AFR analyses.
Patterned-string problems
Patterned-string problems investigate the ability to represent spatial
representations among objects. In this paradigm, a subject is shown an array of strings
(or wires), one of which is tethered to a desirable food. The subject is allowed to pull
only one of the strings, and hence must determine before pulling which string is
actually attached to the food. The difficulty is that many patterned-string problems
consist of strings that cross or are otherwise misleading.
Cha & King (1969) presented evidence indicating that Saimiri may solve
patterned-string problems by simply learning which perceptual configurations have
been previously rewarded. If this is true generally, taxonomic differences in
patterned-string problems might reflect differences in perception and discrimination
learning rather than spatial representation (Tomasello & Call, 1997). Nevertheless, a
learning strategy cannot explain why many non-Saimiri subjects perform virtually
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 157 -
perfectly from the onset of trials, and why, across subjects, these superb performances
tend to occur on the same "easy" problems (see papers cited in procedure 4). Thus,
patterned-string problems probably do reflect the ability for spatial representation, at
least for subjects that perform well.
procedure 4. Harlow & Settlage (1934) first employed the method of giving
subjects 10 standardized patterned string problems for approximately 100 trials.
Subsequent investigations (Finch, 1941; Riesen, Greenberg, Granston, & Fantz, 1953;
Fischer & Kitchener, 1965; Balasch, Sabater-Pi, & Padrosa, 1974) employed
extremely similar methods, allowing us to pool data for 20 Macaca, three
Cercocebus, two Cercopithecus, one Papio, six Mandrillus, two Cebus, one Ateles,
four Pan, five Gorilla, and two Pongo. We first calculated the mean error score for
each genus on each problem and then conducted a two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to confirm that there was significant variation across genera across all
problems (F(18,80) = 10.44, p < 0.0001). We then ranked genera according to their
mean score across all problems and obtained the following ranking, from least to
most errors: Pongo, Pan, Ateles, Gorilla, Mandrillus, Cercocebus, Macaca,
Cercopithecus, Cebus, and Papio. Tomasello & Call (1997) suggested that taxonomic
comparisons may be most meaningful if only the most difficult problems are
considered. Because the error rates on the rates on the last two problems are 1.7 to 10
times higher than on the first eight problems, we re-ranked the taxa based only on the
means on these last two problems. The first four and last two rankings remained
unchanged, but the ranks of Mandrillus, Cercocebus, Macaca, Cercopithecus
differed, and we therefore considered these genera tied. Finally, we repeated the
analysis after omitting all subjects (n = 11) that were not at least 1/2 AFR. The
rankings were very similar and, furthermore, did not change when we repeated the
analysis using only the two most difficult problems. In this case, the rankings were
Pan, Ateles, Cercocebus, Mandrillus, Macaca, Cercopithecus/Papio (tied), and
Cebus.
Invisible displacement
The invisible displacement paradigm is best understood as an extension of the
visible displacement paradigm, a paradigm where virtually all species studied so far
succeed (reviewed in Doré & Dumas, 1987; Tomasello & Call, 1997). In the visible
displacement paradigm, a subject views an object moving towards and then
disappearing behind one or more barriers. If the subject searches the barrier behind
which the object disappeared, this suggests the subject can represent the existence of
unperceived objects or possesses object permanence. By contrast, in most variations
of the invisible displacement paradigm, the subject views an object being placed into
a container, the container is moved behind one or more barriers, and then the subject
is shown that the container is empty. If the subject searches only the barriers behind
which the container passed, it indicates the subject can represent the existence and
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 158 -
spatial movements of unperceived objects.
Numerous studies of invisible displacement have been conducted, but
unfortunately most of them cannot be used for making taxonomic comparisons. One
problem is that early studies did not employ adequate controls to ensure that
successful searching was actually mediated by a representational strategy, rather than
a spatial or associatively learned rule (reviewed in Natale, Antinucci, Spinozzi, &
Poti, 1986; Gagnon & Doré, 1992). A second problem is that, although the capacity
to represent the existence and movements of unperceived objects has been
traditionally viewed as a monolithic entity (i.e., a subject is or is not capable), recent
research indicates that performance is dependent on the specific requirements of the
problem and/or a subject's previous experience (Filion, Washburn, & Gulledge, 1996;
de Blois, Novak, & Bond, 1999). Thus, as for other paradigms, comparisons must be
restricted to studies conducted with the same procedures. Because of the number and
complexity of the test conditions in each study, we have not provided procedural
details. For these, we urge readers to consult the original publications.
procedure 5. Natale & Antinucci (1989; see also Natale et al., 1986) tested
one Gorilla, four Macaca and two Cebus, and after employing a variety of control
procedures, showed that only the Gorilla used a representational strategy to solve the
task. Because several of the subjects, including the Gorilla were less than 1/2 AFR,
this data only counts towards greater than 1/5 AFR analyses.
procedure 6. de Blois, Novak, & Bond (1998) tested seven Pongo and nine
Saimiri in a variety of conditions and found that most or all Pongo subjects used a
representational strategy to solve some kinds of invisible displacement problems. In
contrast, there was no evidence that any Saimiri subjects were capable of solving
problems in this way. All subjects were greater than 1/2 AFR.
procedure 7. de Blois et al. (1999) tested seven Pongo (all had participated in
procedure 6) and five Macaca (see de Blois & Novak, 1994) on a series of problems
that were designed to detect if memory demands affect invisible displacement
performance. There was no evidence that any of the Macaca spontaneously employed
representational strategies, whereas there was such evidence for four Pongo subjects.
All subjects were greater than 1/2 AFR.
Tool Use
Tool use addresses abilities to understand and manipulate how one's actions
affect an intermediate object (the tool), and how the intermediate object affects
another object or substrate. It thus involves aspects of causal reasoning, spatial
representation, and motor coordination. Although many aspects of primate tool use
have been well-studied (reviewed in Beck, 1980; Tomasello & Call, 1997; van Schaik
et al., 1999), there are remarkably few experimental studies that indicate taxonomic
differences in the abilities which underlie tool use.
procedure 8. Natale (1989) studied the development of one Gorilla, three
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 159 -
Macaca, and four Cebus in "the stick problem". (All subjects had participated in
procedure 5). Here food is placed beyond a subject's reach, and a stick is placed in
one of several positions near the food; the subject's task is to employ the stick as a
rake to access the food. All of the subjects readily manipulated the stick and, at least
occasionally, succeeded in accessing the food. Furthermore, the gorilla and three of
four Cebus learned to systematically make contact between the stick and the reward.
In contrast, the three Macaca and one of the Cebus did not develop this strategy,
instead manipulating the stick without reference to the reward, a practice that was less
successful. Hence, Gorilla and Cebus were ranked tied and superior to Macaca. The
gorilla subject was less than 1/2 AFR, as were one Cebus and one Macaca. Of the
remaining subjects, two of three Cebus learned to make systematic contact and none
of the three Macaca did. Hence, Cebus was ranked superior to Macaca in the greater
than 1/2 AFR analysis.
procedure 9. Visalberghi, Rumbaugh, & Fragaszy (1995) tested six Cebus,
five Pan, and one Pongo in a task where a food reward was placed inside a
transparent tube. After subjects had shown the ability to use a dowel to push the food
free, they were provided with a bundle of sticks that was too wide to insert into the
tube. All but one of the Cebus repeatedly made the error of attempting to insert the
entire bundle into the tube. In contrast, all Pan and Pongo subjects consistently
unbundled the sticks before attempting to insert one in the tube. Thus, Pan and Pongo
can be ranked below Cebus. All of the Cebus, one Pan and the one Pongo were
greater than 1/2 AFR, so this ranking also applies to that analysis.
Object Discrimination Learning Set
In the object discrimination learning set paradigm, the subject is first
confronted with the problem of discriminating between two "junk" objects. One of
the objects is arbitrarily designated correct, and the subject is rewarded for selecting
it. The subject is given several trials under these conditions and usually will learn to
consistently make the correct choice (regardless of the object's spatial position). The
learning set phenomenon refers to the observation that if the subject is given another
discrimination problem, with two novel stimuli, it will tend to learn this second
discrimination problem more quickly than it did the first one. Over the course of
several hundred problems, a subject's performance on trial 2 might improve from
about 55% to 80%. (Trial 1 performance must be at chance levels, because there is no
basis for discrimination.) Beginning with Harlow (1949), numerous investigations of
the learning set phenomenon have led to the consensus that it truly indicates the use
some type of abstract rule or hypothesis (e.g., "win-stay, lose-shift") that goes beyond
discrimination learning (reviewed in Miles, 1965; Fobes & King, 1982; Schrier,
1984).
Although there is a vast amount of published data on learning sets in different
primate species, it is difficult to make meaningful quantitative comparisons because
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition

investigations usually differ in many ways that are known to affect performance.
These include the amount pre-training and/or previous experience, the number of
trials per problem, the use of a correction procedure, and the position of the objects
relative to the food wells (reviewed in Miles, 1965; Fobes & King, 1982). Although
improvements across trials (i.e., the learning set phenomenon) have been shown for
many types of learning, we only present information in this section on object
discrimination learning sets. Taxonomic comparisons for other types of learning
improvements are included in other paradigms (e.g., detour problems, reversal
learning, oddity learning).
procedure 10. Miles & Meyer (1956) & Miles (1957a) tested three Saimiri,
three Callithrix, and four Macaca with six trials per problem after minimal pre-
training. For trial 2 performance across all problem blocks, Macaca consistently
outperformed Saimiri, which in turn consistently performed better than Callithrix.
Rumbaugh Sammons, Prim, & Philips (1965a) tested four Saimiri with extremely
similar procedures. Although Rumbaugh et al. (1965a) presented data on smaller
problem blocks (50 vs. 200 problems), through interpolation, we were able to make
some direct comparisons. In all cases, the Saimiri of Rumbaugh et al. (1965a) were
also intermediate between Macaca and Callithrix. All Callithrix, and the Saimiri from
Rumbaugh et al. (1965a) were greater than 1/2 AFR, allowing this ranking to be
counted in the greater than 1/2 AFR analysis.
procedure 11. Shell & Riopelle (1958) tested three Ateles, six Cebus, and
three Saimiri. Subjects had blocks of six trials per problem, alternated with blocks of
problems that were learned to a criterion. On trial 2 of all problem blocks, Ateles
performed better than Cebus, which, in turn, consistently performed better than
Saimiri. Because all subjects were listed as adolescents, this data only counts for
greater than 1/5 AFR analysis.
procedure 12. Stevens (1965) tested five Macaca, four Cebus, and three
Lemur with six trials per problem after subjects had previously worked in studies of
reversal and concurrent and successive discrimination learning. Across all problem
blocks, Macaca and Cebus consistently performed better than Lemur on trials 2-6;
however, Macaca and Cebus did not differ consistently or significantly from each
other. Because the subjects' ages were not provided, this data only counts towards the
greater than 1/5 AFR analysis.
procedure 13. Stevens (1965) tested five Macaca, four Cebus, and two Lemur
(different subjects than in procedure 12) in problems where subjects worked on a
particular discrimination until they reached a criterion of eight consecutive correct
responses. Subjects had previously worked in studies of reversal and concurrent and
successive discrimination learning. Across all problem blocks, Macaca consistently
performed better than Cebus, which, in turn, consistently performed better than
Lemur. Because the subjects' ages were not provided, this data only counts towards
the greater than 1/5 AFR analysis.
procedure 14. Manocha (1967) tested four Presbytis and six Macaca with six
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 161 -
trials per problem. This study was unusual because stones were used as
discrimination objects, and data were presented on performance across all six trials,
rather than just for trial 2. Across all problem blocks, Presbytis performed better than
Macaca. All subjects were greater than 1/2 AFR.
procedure 15. Rumbaugh & McCormack (1967) tested six Pan, three Pongo,
seven Gorilla, five Hylobates, and seven Macaca in several conditions. Subjects first
were given 500 problems of six trials each; then they were given 25 trial problems
until they scored 20 correct for 10 out of 12 consecutive problems (inter-problem
criterion); finally, they were given 50 problems of two trials each. There was very
little variation in the second condition but, in the first and third conditions, there was
variation, and rankings were consistent: Macaca, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and
Hylobates. When we removed subjects that were less than 1/2 AFR (n = 17), the
rankings on phase 1 one were Gorilla, Macaca, Pan, Hylobates, Pongo. On phase
two the rankings were Macaca, Pan, Gorilla, Hylobates, and Pongo. Because we
consider taxa with inconsistent rankings to be tied, the final ordering for subjects
greater than 1/2 AFR was Macaca/Gorilla/Pan (tie), Hylobates, and Pongo.
procedure 16. Schrier (1972) tested six Macaca and four Miopithecus in a
higher-order type of object discrimination learning set study. Subjects first learned a
series of 24 color or form discrimination problems to criterion and then learned 24
problems of the opposite type (e.g., if color first then shift to form). The question was
how well subjects would do when shifting to a new type of problem (i.e., how much
their previous experience would help them). Macaca and Miopithecus did not differ
in learning their original of the 24 problems, but Schrier (1972) showed that Macaca
performed significantly better than Miopithecus when shifted to the new kind of
problem. It might be argued that this difference mainly reflects Macaca's slightly
(and non-significantly) better performance on the original learning and hence
advantage in these particular kinds of discrimination. Nevertheless, Schrier's (1972)
table 2 shows that, although both Macaca and Miopithecus were nearly perfect
discriminators on the final day of original learning, Macaca performed far better on
the first day of shift learning. Thus, we ranked Macaca below Miopithecus. Because
the ages of Miopithecus were not provided, this data only counts for greater than 1/5
AFR analysis.
procedure 17. Ohta (1983) and Ohta, Ishida, & Matano (1984, 1987) tested
six Nycticebus, five Lemur, and five Galago with six trials per problem after 32
training problems with 50 trials per problem. Lemur achieved the highest mean trial
two score across all problem blocks, indicating the existence of meaningful
taxonomic variation (see also Ohta et al., 1987). Nycticebus achieved the second
highest grand mean across all problem blocks, and hence is ranked below Galago. All
subjects were greater than 1/2 AFR.

Reversal Learning
The reversal learning or intra-dimensional shift paradigm investigates the
ability to reverse a previously learned discrimination. Most commonly, over the
course of several trials, a subject learns to make one object discrimination in order to
get a reward (e.g., picking one object rather than another). Then, without warning, the
values of the objects change so that the previously unrewarded object is rewarded for
a run of trials. As in the discrimination learning set paradigm, reversal learning is
thought to reflect a subject's ability to form and use abstract rules or "hypotheses"
(Gossette & Inman, 1966; Gossette & Slonim, 1969; Rumbaugh, 1970). Typical
questions include "how quickly do subjects learn to reverse a previously acquired
discrimination?" and "does better acquisition learning lead to faster or to slower
reversal learning?" The expectation is that if subjects can employ abstract rules, better
acquisition should lead to better reversal. On the other hand, if subjects are more
limited to associative learning, then better acquisition should lead to poorer
performance when reward values are reversed. The major advantage of the reversal
learning paradigm is that taxonomic comparisons can be made after equating subjects
for baseline acquisition learning. In other words, taxonomic differences are unlikely
to simply reflect artifacts such as one species' predisposition for certain kinds of
perceptual-motor functioning (Bitterman, 1965; Rumbaugh & Pate, 1984).
procedure 18. Meyer (1951) and Cotterman, Meyer, & Wickens (1956) tested
nine Macaca and two Callithrix (both Callithrix participated in procedure 10) on a
series of problems consisting of a six, eight, or 10 acquisition trials and eight reversal
trials. Direct comparisons could be made for three problem blocks, and in all cases,
on trial 2, Macaca performed better than Callithrix. Because no ages were provided
for the Macaca subjects, this data cannot be included in the greater than 1/2 AFR
analysis.
procedure 19. Crawford (1962) tested three Macaca, three Cebus, and three
Ateles (the same Cebus and Ateles probably participated in procedure 11) in reversal
learning with spatial cues. The apparatus allowed four possible object locations, left
lower, left upper, right lower, and right upper. At the beginning of a problem, for
example, the rewarded object would be in left lower, a non-rewarded object would be
in left upper, and the two right positions would be empty. After three or eight
consecutive correct trials, the reward values were reversed for the objects, and the
objects also shifted to a new spatial orientation, e.g., right upper rewarded object, left
upper non-rewarded object, and two lower positions empty. Thus, this was an object
discrimination reversal problem with spatial cues indicating the onset of reversal. We
ranked Ateles first because it had the highest mean score across problem blocks for all
trials. Macaca performed better than Cebus on reversal trial 1, but Cebus did better
overall; hence these taxa were considered tied. Because subjects were described as
immatures, this study cannot be included in the greater than 1/2 AFR analysis.
procedure 20. Stevens (1965) tested 12 Macaca, 10 Cebus, and five Lemur
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 163 -
(all subjects had participated in procedure 12 or procedure 13). Each day subjects
were given trials on an object discrimination problem until they chose the correct
object for 12 consecutive trials or had received 50 trials. After subjects had performed
correctly for 12 consecutive trials on two consecutive days, on the following day, the
values of the objects were reversed. Subjects were given the reversal problem until
they had reached the same criterion used in the acquisition phase. On the two error
score measures, Macaca performed better than Cebus, which in turn performed better
than Lemur. On one of these measures, the "reversal perseveration score", Stevens
(1965) demonstrated the taxonomic variation was statistically significant. Hence, we
ordered the taxa as Macaca, Cebus and Lemur. At least some of the subjects in each
genus were apparently less than 1/2 AFR, so this data only counts for greater than 1/5
AFR analysis.
procedure 21. Gossette and colleagues (Gossette & Inman, 1966; Gossette &
Slonim, 1969; Gossette, 1970) tested three Aotus, four Hylobates, three Saimiri, and
four Cebus on a series of spatial reversal problems. Subjects experienced daily
sessions of 20 discrimination trials where either the left or right object was
consistently rewarded. Once a subject had reached the criterion of 18 or more correct
choices in a session, the rewarded position was reversed and the subject had sessions
of 20 trials under this new condition; once the criterion of 18 correct was reached the
rewarded position was again reversed. Subjects had a total of 20 position reversals
and Gossette (1970) provided data on the mean error scores for each genus for the
first 20 trials after each reversal. Gossette (1970) showed that there was significant
taxonomic variation across the 20 position reversals, and the overall rankings for
grand mean error scores were Cebus, Hylobates, Aotus, and Saimiri. Ages were not
provided for Cebus and Saimiri, but all Aotus and Hylobates were adults, and hence
their rankings apply to the greater than 1/2 AFR analysis.
procedure 22. Rumbaugh & Arnold (1971) tested four Cercopithecus, one
Eulemur, and two Lemur in a reversal task where subjects had to choose between a
green circle and a white circle. For 51 trials one color was rewarded and then, for the
next 51 trials, the other color was rewarded; a total of 200 reversals were presented to
each subject. The authors pooled results for Eulemur and Lemur as "Lemur" and this
group did significantly worse than Cercopithecus by several criteria. Most strikingly,
in cases where "Lemur" subjects had achieved a high acquisition score on the last 20
pre-reversal trials, they did very poorly when they had to reverse the discrimination.
In contrast, Cercopithecus showed the opposite pattern, performing better on reversal
after performing well in acquisition. Although data on Lemur and Eulemur are not
presented separately, Rumbaugh & Arnold (1971) indicated that there was little
difference between them. Hence, we considered Cercopithecus to rank below Lemur
and Eulemur and consider the latter two genera tied. Subjects were "late juveniles or
young adults," and thus this data is included in the greater than 1/2 AFR analysis.
procedure 23. Rumbaugh (1997; see Rumbaugh, 1970; Rumbaugh & Pate,
1984; Rumbaugh, Savage-Rumbaugh, & Washburn, 1996; Cooper, 1980; De Lillo &
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 164 -
Visalberghi, 1994) compiled data for 11 genera on series of reversal problems that
collectively yield a "transfer-of-learning" score. The subject first receives visual
discrimination problems where, for each problem, reversal occurs after the subject
has achieved 67% performance on the acquisition trials; the subject then receives 11
reversal trials. Over a series of problems, the ratio of percentage correct in the
reversal trials (omitting the first trial) to percentage correct in the acquisition trials
(approximately 67%) yields a transfer index at 67% (TI-67). This technique is then
repeated with an 84% criterion for acquisition trials, and a TI-84 is produced. Finally,
the TI-67 value is subtracted from the TI-84 and the remainder is the "transfer-of-
learning" score. A negative score indicates a subject is better able to reverse a learned
response if the original learning was weak, whereas a positive score indicates a
subject can better reverse a learned response if the original learning was strong. Thus,
a positive "transfer-of-learning" score can be taken as evidence that the subject relies
more on an abstract rule about the potential relationships between elements, rather
than simply associating their outcomes. Although variances are not available of
"transfer-of-learning" scores, the ranges for various genera on the TI-67 and TI-84
are provided in Rumbaugh & Pate (1984), and indicate that some taxa do not overlap
others at all. Hence, it can be assumed that there is substantial variation. We ranked
genera according to the mean scores presented in Rumbaugh (1997), except that we
combined the scores for all Pan (including language-trained subjects) and excluded
Saimiri because the five subjects tested were the best performers in a colony of 40
(Rumbaugh & Pate, 1984; Rumbaugh, pers. comm.). The rankings were Pan/Gorilla
(tied), Pongo, Macaca, Cercopithecus, Cebus/Hylobates (tied), Lemur, Phaner,
Microcebus, Miopithecus. Because some subjects in Rumbaugh's compilation were
juveniles (Rumbaugh, pers. comm.), this data only counts towards the greater than
1/5 AFR analyses.
Oddity Learning
The oddity learning paradigm addresses the ability to use a relational or
abstract concept. Most commonly, a subject is simultaneously provided with three
visual stimuli, two of which are identical, and one that differs; the subject is rewarded
for choosing the differing or odd stimulus. One difficulty is that with several of the
procedures that have been employed, subjects could succeed in the task without using
a true oddity concept. For instance, for various reasons, investigators frequently
omitted stimulus configurations where the middle object was odd; thus, subjects
could have succeeded using the rule, "pick the end stimulus that differs from the
middle stimulus" (King & Fobes, 1982). Although the fact that some procedures may
not necessarily reveal the use of an oddity concept is of interest (e.g., Thomas &
Noble, 1988), this issue is not crucial for the present comparisons, provided the
subject must use some other type of conceptual strategy or, at the very least, must
employ learning sets. In the procedure previously mentioned, for example, subjects
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 165 -
would at least have to use some kind of same-different concept. Hence, we included
nearly all procedures that allow taxonomic comparisons. The only exception is that
we did not consider studies that use the same few stimulus configurations throughout
the entire study (i.e., one-odd, two-odd procedures: Bromer, 1940; Vatsuro &
Kashkay, 1965) because it is known that in such studies subjects may memorize the
rewards associated with different configurations. Hence, the entire study may only
require learning a handful of pattern discriminations (King & Fobes, 1982) and so
may not provide a discriminating cognitive task.
procedure 24. Strong & Hedges (1966) tested three Pan and three Macaca on
problems where the odd stimulus never appeared in the middle position. Nine wood
objects were used in 72 different configurations to test a subject until they scored
90% within a session of 48 trials. Pan reached criterion in significantly fewer
sessions than Macaca. Because subjects were not greater than 1/2 AFR, this study
only applies to greater than 1/5 AFR analyses.
procedure 25. Davis, Leary, Stevens, & Thompson (1967) tested 24 Macaca,
nine Cebus, eight Saimiri, four Lagothrix, two Cercopithecus, and four Lemur on
problems where the odd stimulus never appeared in the middle position. (Most
subjects probably also participated in procedure 3.) Each problem included 12
shaping or training trials and 12 test trials, all based on four related stimulus
configurations. After pooling the data from the three Macaca species, we used
ANCOVA to confirm that across the 15 eight-problem blocks, there was significant
variation across genera (F(15,70) = 80.62, p < 0.0001). We then calculated the grand
mean score for each genus and obtained the following ranks: Lagothrix, Cebus,
Macaca, Saimiri, Lemur, Cercopithecus. The data were not presented in a manner
that allowed subjects that were more than 1/5 AFR to be distinguished from those that
were more than 1/2 AFR; hence, this data only counts towards the greater than 1/5
AFR analyses.
procedure 26. Thomas & Boyd (1973) tested Saimiri and Cebus on three
types of oddity problems. First, four subjects of each genus were given a series of five
trial problems where each problem presented the same stimulus configuration for all
trials. Second, four of these subjects (two per genus) were given a similar series of
five trial problems, but on trials two to four, the configuration was altered so that the
stimulus that had been odd became common. Finally, four of the subjects were given
one-trial oddity problems. Although all subjects performed fairly well, Cebus
performed better than Saimiri on all three types of problems and hence was ranked
lower. All subjects were greater than 1/2 AFR.
Sorting
The sorting paradigm examines the ability to form abstract concepts and to
use them to categorize stimuli accordingly. Numerous approaches have been used to
investigate sorting in primates (reviewed in Tomasello & Call, 1997), but apparently
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 166 -
only one study has employed formal training (i.e., providing rewards) to investigate
multiple genera.
procedure 27. Garcha & Ettlinger (1979) tested five Pan, six Macaca, and
three Cebus in a task wherein subjects were presented with three exemplars of three
different kinds of objects (nine objects total) and three jars. To be rewarded, subjects
had to place the similar objects in the same jar. Pan can be ranked first in this
procedure, because four of five Pan subjects but none of the others performed above
chance within the first 100 trials. In later stages of testing (trials 880-2418), two
Cebus and one Macaca performed above chance. Thus, although Cebus performed
slightly better than Macaca, this does not meet our criterion of a meaningful
difference and so these taxa were considered tied. Because it is unclear whether any
of the Cebus or Macaca subjects were greater than 1/2 AFR, this test only counts for
greater than 1/5 AFR analyses.
Delayed Response
The delayed response paradigm investigates a subject's memory or ability to
maintain a representation of an item when it is no longer available to immediate
perception. In most studies, the subject observes a reward being hidden in one of two
spatial locations, there is a delay, and then the subject is allowed to search one of the
locations. The questions of interest are "for any given time interval, what percentage
of first searches are correct?" and "what is the maximum delay at which a subject can
still score above chance?" Since its introduction by Hunter (1913), many
investigators have questioned the validity of the paradigm on the grounds that
experimental procedures, contextual variables, and previous experience can
dramatically alter a subject's maximum delay (e.g., Maier & Schneirla, 1935; Fobes
& King, 1982; Macphail, 1982; Shettleworth, 1998). Nevertheless, if one restricts
comparisons to subjects with similar experience, operating in the same conditions,
fruitful taxonomic comparisons can be made (Tinklepaugh, 1928; Fletcher, 1965).
Fletcher (1965) provides an excellent review of the delayed response paradigm and
the variables known to affect performance.
procedure 28. Tinklepaugh (1932) tested two Macaca and two Pan subjects in
tests of multiple delayed response. In one variation, subjects were led into a series of
rooms and in each room they witnessed a reward being hidden in one of two similar
containers; after a delay, they were allowed to revisit the rooms and search one of
containers in each room. A second variation of the study was conducted entirely in
one room; the subject witnessed a series of paired containers being baited (one of the
two containers with reward); after a delay, they were allowed to search one of the
containers in each paired set. In both variations, Pan generally showed such greater
proficiency in pre-training that they were given more difficult tests. Despite the
greater difficulty, however, they invariably performed better than Macaca. For
instance, in the first version of the study, Pan obtained a mean score of 90% when
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 167 -
tested with 10 rooms whereas Macaca scored 80% when being tested with only five
rooms. A direct comparison could be made in the case where both genera witnessed
eight pairs of containers being baited in the same room. Macaca achieved a mean
score of 61% whereas Pan scored 87%. Hence, Pan was ranked below Macaca. All
subjects were greater than 1/2 AFR.
procedure 29. Harlow et al. (1932) and Maslow & Harlow (1932) provided
data on delayed response for one Pongo, one Pan, one Gorilla, one Hylobates, six
Papio, five Mandrillus, nine Macaca, three Cercopithecus, one Cercocebus, five
Cebus, one Lagothrix, and one Varecia. (Several of these subjects also participated in
procedure 4.) Subjects were tested with delays of zero, five, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180
seconds; once they had demonstrated proficiency on one delay, they began receiving
problems with the next longest delay. Subjects typically received 60 to 200 problems
with each delay, but if they demonstrated exceptional performance, they were
sometimes advanced to the next delay after fewer problems. We first computed mean
scores for each genus at each interval, although we omitted two scores that were
based on only one or two trials. Calculating mean scores for genera with multiple
subjects was complicated by the fact that subjects that performed poorly on one
interval were usually not tested on longer intervals. This could have biased scoring
towards better-represented genera, as their scores on longer intervals would be based
on their best subjects. We avoided this problem by assuming that if a subject had
performed below chance on one interval (as determined with chi-square tests; Deaner
unpublished), they could be assigned a score of 50% (chance) on longer intervals. We
were thus able to calculate a meaningful mean score for each genus at each interval.
In using these scores for rankings, we looked for evidence that a taxon performed
consistently better or worse than others across all intervals or at least across relatively
long intervals. Because Pongo was the best performer at each interval and Papio was
consistently second best, we ranked these genera first and second, respectively. The
remaining genera were more difficult to rank, because they sometimes reversed ranks
according to the time delay. Hence, we considered the longest interval at which the
generic mean was above chance. This was 120 seconds for Pan, Macaca, Mandrillus,
Hylobates, and Cercopithecus, 30 seconds for Gorilla and Cercocebus, and 15
seconds for Lagothrix, Cebus, and Varecia. Pan, Gorilla, and two of the Mandrillus
subjects were less than 1/2 AFR. Using the same logic as above, we reconsidered the
data without these younger subjects and obtained the following rankings: Pongo,
Papio, Mandrillus, Hylobates/ Macaca/ Cercopithecus (tied), Cercocebus/ Varecia/
Lagothrix/ Cebus (tied).
procedure 30. Miles (1957b) tested three Callithrix and three Macaca. After
100 pre-training trials with zero second delays, subjects were given 900-1200
problems where randomly occurring delays were one, two, four, or 16 seconds.
Macaca performed consistently better than Callithrix at all comparable delays.
Fischer & Kitchener (1965) conducted a very similar study with two Pongo and two
Gorilla (subjects participated in procedure 4) although in this case, delays of 32 and
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 168 -
64 seconds were also interspersed with the shorter delays. (This modification could
depress performance on shorter delays: see Fletcher, 1965.) When comparisons are
restricted to comparable delays where subject have comparable experience (see
Fischer & Kitchener's figure 3), Pongo performed consistently better than all other
taxa and Callithrix consistently performed the worst. The grand mean for Gorilla was
higher than for Macaca, suggesting that Gorilla should be ranked lower, but, because
Macaca actually performed slightly better on the longest comparable delay (arguably
the most crucial measure), we considered Gorilla and Macaca tied. Because none of
the subjects in these studies were greater than 1/2 AFR, this test only counts for
greater than 1/5 AFR analysis.
Statistical methods
Factor analysis has proven useful in characterizing the abilities underlying
human performance in IQ and related testing batteries (reviewed by Child, 1970;
Mackintosh, 1998). Although the structure of the present data set is somewhat
similar, we did not use factor analysis because there were numerous missing values in
the data matrix, and because we wished to avoid the assumption of a linear effect
underlying trait variables between paradigms (Bartholomew, 1987).
Instead, we employed a Bayesian latent variable model of multi-study rank
data, which was designed to assess whether there is a global variable that explains
taxonomic variation in rankings across paradigms and procedures (Johnson et al.,
2002; for a potential non-Bayesian approach to analyzing this data, see Yu, Lam, &
Lo, 2005). The model is based on the assumption of a latent ability ij
satisfying
ij
= i
+ i,g(j)
+ ij
,
where ij
denotes a latent variable representing the perceived performance of
the ith genus in the jth procedure. The variable ij
is related to the observed ranking of
the procedure by making the assumption that Yij
, the rank of the ith genus in the jth
procedure, is greater than Ykj
, the rank of the kth genus in the jth procedure, only when
Zij
> Zkj
. The variable i
denotes the global variable of the ith genus and estimates its
general cognitive ability. Paradigm-genus biases are denoted by i,g(j)
and represent
bias of the jth procedure in the gth paradigm for showing the ability of the ith genus.
Random errors associated with the observation of  in the jth procedure are
represented by ij
.
The model assumes, therefore, that any given ranking derives from two
underlying, continuous latent variables: a global variable for the cognitive ability of
the genus and a paradigm-genus bias effect which represents variations in the
observed rankings due to the genus-paradigm interaction. More simply, the global
variable for each genus represents its overall score across all procedures and
paradigms (i.e., corresponding to domain-general ability), whereas the paradigm-
genus bias effect indicates the extent to which a genus performs better or worse on
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 169 -
one paradigm compared to other paradigms (domain-specific abilities). Significant
paradigm-genus bias effects indicate that the assumption of a uni-dimensional global
variable is violated. Likewise, the greater the proportion of variation explained by the
paradigm-genus bias effects, the smaller the proportion of variation potentially
explained by the global variable. We have previously demonstrated that this model is
capable of detecting paradigm-genus bias effects (Johnson et al., 2002).
In order to establish a scale of measurement for the global variables, these
variables are assumed a priori to have a standard normal distribution. Similarly, the
paradigm-genus bias effects are assumed to have a mean zero normal distribution,
and both the procedure variance (i.e., error) parameters and the paradigm-genus
variance parameters are assumed drawn from a common inverse-gamma distribution.
Further details concerning this hierarchical specification are provided in Johnson et
al. (2002).
Two additional points deserve mention here. First, the model considers tied
rankings to be indicative of similarity in underlying parameters, i
and i,g(j)
, rather
than indicative of insensitive tests. This assumption is warranted because we only
included procedures in the meta-analysis that yielded clear rank differences among at
least some genera. Thus, these procedures can be considered sensitive enough to
permit the conclusion that tied rankings reflected similar abilities, rather than poor
tests. Second, the probabilities of the model parameters can be readily assessed using
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. This allowed us to determine the probability
that genera differed from each other in their estimated global variables and to assess
whether paradigm-genus bias effects were significantly different from zero.
To examine differences between taxonomic groupings above the genus (see
above for taxonomic groupings), we also examined the probability that the mean of
each taxonomic grouping's global variable differed from the global variable of each
of the other taxonomic groupings. To compute these probabilities, we compared the
sample means of the global variables for each taxonomic grouping using 1,000,000
simulated values of each genus's global variables obtained from the Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm that was used to sample from the posterior distribution over
these variables. In other words, we estimated the probability that the mean value of
the global variable for the great apes (Pongo, Pan, and Gorilla) was less than the
mean value of global variable for the lesser apes (Hylobates), and so on for all other
comparisons among all groupings.
Results
General patterns
None of the posterior means of the paradigm-genus bias effects were found to
be statistically significant, meaning there was no indication of domain-specific
abilities. In fact, the posterior mean of the paradigm-genus bias precision parameters
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition

was approximately seven times larger than the posterior mean of the procedure-
precision (error) parameters, suggesting that the paradigm genus-bias effects
accounted for less than 1/7 of the variation attributable to the procedural variation
(see Johnson et al., 2002). Only two of the paradigm-genus bias effects, both in the
object discrimination learning sets paradigm, exceeded 0.5, but neither of these could
be reliably distinguished as being either positive or negative (see Johnson et al.
[2002] for details). The first paradigm-genus bias effect refers to Presbytis's
performance in procedure 14; because Presbytis is not represented in any of the other
procedures, its performance cannot meaningfully be attributed to a paradigm-genus
bias effect. Second, in procedure 15, Macaca outperformed the three great apes,
Gorilla, Pan, and Pongo, which was unexpected based on its performance in the rest
of the data set. In this case, the paradigm-genus bias effect did not reach significance
because Macaca's strong performance in other procedures within this paradigm was
achieved primarily against taxa that it also outperformed in other paradigms. These
examples illustrate the general pattern that, although there were some outlying
procedures in this data set, they were not concentrated in particular paradigms.
Hence, because paradigm-genus bias effects were unimportant, we fit a reduced
model without these effects.
The global variables for the genera in the reduced model varied substantially,
as they did in the full model (figure 1). In fact, pair-wise comparisons indicated that,
in several cases, genera differed significantly (figure 2). Although Bayesian models,
such as the one we employed, do not readily lend themselves to inferences regarding
the amount of variation explained (but see Menard, 2000), a simple way to investigate
the power of the hypothesized global variables is to ask how often they correctly
predict rankings in the data set. It turns out that out of 229 genus-by-genus
comparisons, 194 (84.7%) were predicted correctly with the reduced model. The
complete model (i.e., incorporating estimates of paradigm-genus bias effects) also
predicts 194 of the 229 comparisons (table 2). Hence, the hypothesis of differing
domain-general cognitive abilities, estimated by a uni-dimensional global variable, is
strongly supported.
Visual inspection of figures 1 and 2 suggests a pattern of taxonomic variation,
with the great apes performing better than the other taxonomic groupings. When we
explored this possibility more formally with simulations, we found that great apes did
indeed have significantly lower global variable means than any other taxonomic
grouping (table 3), indicating that they were generally the best performers. Among
the other comparisons, the only other significant difference was that Old World
monkeys had lower global variable means than did prosimians, although New World
monkeys tended to outperform prosimians as well. Although these results imply, for
example, that the "average Old World monkey" outperforms the "average
prosimian", our data set did not include information on all genera in these groupings
and thus these results should be viewed cautiously.

Indeed, there is a trend in the Old World and New World monkeys for
smaller-bodied (and usually smaller-brained) genera to perform poorly, and thus the
overall poor performance of the prosimian group could be due to the fact that there
was no information available on the relatively large-bodied genera, Daubentonia,
Propithecus, and Indri. Likewise, it is worth emphasizing that some genera

performed markedly better (Ateles) or worse (Callithrix, Miopithecus) than others in
their taxonomic grouping. Another reason these taxonomic comparisons should be
viewed cautiously is that the large number of comparisons (10) inflates the type 1
error rate. If the conventional  of 0.05 is adjusted to 0.005, the Old World monkeys
and prosimians no longer differ significantly, although great apes remain distinct
from every other taxonomic group.

Tests of robustness
One reason that paradigm-genus bias effects might not have been detected is
that bias effects may span several paradigms and were masked because the paradigms
were treated separately, rather than grouped according to underlying task demands.
For instance, if a genus performed extremely well in five theoretically similar
paradigms but performed rather poorly in the other four paradigms, it would be
unlikely that the model would detect any paradigm-genus bias effects because effects
in each paradigm would be assessed relative to the eight other paradigms, three or
four of which would exhibit similar rankings.
The simplest way to explore the possibility of masking is to group paradigms
into "superparadigms" based on a priori similarity. Tomasello & Call's (1997)
review of primate cognition suggests the following superparadigms: (1) space and
objects: detour problems, patterned-string problems, and invisible displacement; (2)
features and categories: object discrimination learning sets, reversal learning, oddity
learning, sorting, and delayed response; (3) discrimination learning: object
discrimination learning sets, reversal learning, and oddity learning; and, finally, (4)
learning sets: object discrimination learning sets and reversal learning. Hence, we
repeated our analyses four times, testing for different superparadigm-genus bias
effects in each case. In other words, in the first replication, all procedures in detour
problems, patterned-string problems, and invisible displacement were grouped as the
space and objects paradigm, and all other procedures remained assigned to their
original paradigms. However, contrary to the idea of underlying superparadigms, we
found no significant superparadigm-genus bias effects in any of these analyses.
Furthermore, the explanatory power of these superparadigm models was nearly
identical to that obtained with the reduced model (table 2) and the global variables of
the genera were nearly identical.
Another reason that we might not have detected paradigm-genus bias effects
is that our analysis included all subjects greater than 1/5 AFR, and it is conceivable
that such a broad age range somehow obscured the effects. Hence, we repeated our
analysis using the data restricted to subjects greater than 1/2 AFR. In this analysis, we
again found that global trait values often differed significantly and no evidence for
significant paradigm-genus effects. Although the explanatory power of this greater
than 1/2 AFR model was slightly less than that of the reduced model based on all
data, it was still quite high (table 2). More notable is the fact that the global variables
of the genera are substantially more compressed than in the other analyses (figure 1).
This, however, is attributable to the fact that there was little data in this
analysis and, under the Bayesian model used here, all genera begin with global
measures of zero and only become differentiated as rankings are incorporated.
Because of the limited data, the ordering of the global variables is also somewhat
different than in other models (figure 1), although Pongo and Pan remain the best
performers.

A third potential problem with our analysis is that several individuals are
represented twice in the data set. Thus, what we have interpreted as consistent
taxonomic differences might instead reflect consistent differences among individuals
that happen to belong to different genera. Of course, these interpretations are not
mutually exclusive (i.e., consistent individual differences are likely to be at least
partially due to taxonomic effects). The crucial question is whether taxonomic
differences remain once the data set is restricted such that each subject may
contribute to it only once. Hence, we repeated the initial analysis after omitting
procedures and thus any potential "double counting". In deciding which procedures to
omit when two employed the same subjects, we retained the one that included more
genera; in cases where both procedures included the same number of genera, we
retained the one that came first in chronological order. Thus, we omitted procedures
2, 4, 8, 11, 20, and 25. The model that was refit without these procedures again had
no significant paradigm-genus bias effects, several significantly differing global
variables, and explanatory power and global variable orderings that were extremely
similar to those of the reduced model based on all data (table 2, figure 1). Thus, the
taxonomic differences in our analysis are not merely the product of a few exceptional
subjects.
Discussion
This study's primary finding is that some primate taxa performed consistently
better than others across a wide range of cognitive paradigms. In contrast, there was
no evidence that some taxa performed especially well in particular paradigms.
Furthermore, these results proved robust when paradigms were grouped into various
superparadigms and when the potential effect of pseudo-replication of individuals
was eliminated. The possibly confounding effect of age was examined by excluding
small juveniles (between 1/5 and 1/2 AFR), and this result differed most clearly from
the others (figure 1). Importantly, however, paradigm-genus bias effects remained
small and insignificant, suggesting that the poor differentiation among the genera was
due to the small size of the remaining sample, rather than to the presence of
specialized abilities.
Taken together, these results imply the existence of taxonomic differences in
some sort of domain-general cognitive ability. It is important to stress, however, that
differences in a domain-general ability are fully compatible with the existence of
other differing abilities, including domain-specific ones. In fact, it is probable that as
more data accumulate, including on additional paradigms, future studies will detect
paradigm-genus bias effects and other higher dimensional factors. Nonetheless,
because the factor identified here already predicts approximately 85% of the
rankings, it is likely to re-emerge as the primary factor in future studies, at least in
primates.

Objections
Comparative learning reviews commonly argue that claims of taxonomic
differences are weak because within species variation often exceeds between species
variation so that individuals of "low-achieving" taxa sometimes outperform those of
"high-achieving" taxa (e.g., Ehrlich et al., 1976; MacPhail, 1982; Essock-Vitale &
Seyfarth, 1987; Tomasello & Call, 1997). Nonetheless, the apparent absence of the
predicted taxonomic variation could have several causes besides the absence of
underlying cognitive differences. First, upon close inspection of the evidence, it is
clear that some claims of taxonomic overlap are misleading. For example, Tomasello
and Call (1997, p.103) cite evidence from Cooper (1974) that black lemurs (Eulemur
macaco) perform better than or equal to most monkeys and apes in object
discrimination learning sets. However, the lemurs generally had between five and
fifteen times more trials per problem than did subjects in other studies, a difference
that should have dramatically improved their performance (Levine, Levinson, &
Harlow, 1959). Second, because tests directly measure performance, not intrinsic
abilities, contextual confounds can obscure true differences. In procedure 15, where
several apes performed poorly, the relevant objects were encased in plexi-glass bins,
a situation which was later shown to be highly distracting for some species
(Rumbaugh & McCormack, 1967; see also Ternes, Abordo, & Rumbaugh, 1965).
The final, and most important, reason that taxonomic overlap does not weaken our
claim of taxonomic differences is that evolutionary theory fully expects that
developmental and genetic differences will produce substantial phenotypic variation.
Although this variation is worth emphasizing, it is fully compatible with the
significant overall taxonomic differences we demonstrated.
The second issue alluded to in the previous paragraph­the maxim that
differences in performance do not automatically indicate differences in ability­
deserves further attention. As noted in the Introduction, the meta-analysis approach
should generally resolve the performance-ability conundrum because, if consistent
differences are found across varying situations, it is unlikely that the difference
merely reflects an unconsidered variable that biases testing towards particular taxa
(Kamil, 1988). Nevertheless, it is conceivable that, although the paradigms in the data
set involve a variety of testing contexts and materials, they might share some
underlying bias that allows certain taxa (e.g., great apes) to do better than others.
There are two likely candidates: manual skill and visual ability.
Manual skill of some kind is required for almost all of the testing procedures,
and there is a strong relationship between overall global indices and manual skill
(Deaner, unpublished; van Schaik et al., 1999). Nevertheless, in most of the
procedures, differences in manual skill per se cannot explain performance differences
(but see Beck, 1967). For instance, in object discrimination learning sets, reversal
learning, oddity learning, and delayed response paradigms, animals must choose
which food well to uncover. In preliminary trials, virtually all subjects master this
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition

task; pronounced differences emerge only after the manipulation of certain variables
(e.g., length of delay) unrelated to reward recovery.
Visual ability is also required in all of the tests, and it could be argued, for
instance, that prosimians performed poorly because of their relatively low acuity
(Neuringer, Kosobud, & Cochrane, 1981; Langston, Casagrande, & Fox, 1986). This
argument is sensible for prosimians in detour problems and patterned-string problems
but does not accommodate results in other paradigms where baseline levels of
performance must be demonstrated initially, such as object discrimination learning
sets, reversal learning, oddity learning, and delayed response. Furthermore,
differences in visual ability cannot readily explain the differing performances of great
apes and monkeys. Most relevantly, Macaca, although performing worse than the
great apes in most procedures, is thought to possess visual capabilities that are
virtually identical to those of great apes and humans (Berkley, 1976; Jacobs, 1995).
Although visual processing requirements cannot account for most taxonomic
differences, the ubiquity of visual requirements is potentially relevant to the
interpretation of these differences. In particular, it could be argued that rather than
implying differences in some kind of "domain-general" cognition, this study's results
only indicate differences in general cognition in the visual domain. At present, there
simply is no relevant data to test this interpretation (e.g., whether prosimians perform
better than anthropoids in learning set problems if olfactory rather than visual stimuli
are employed). Nonetheless, even if it turns out that the differences we identified are
restricted to the visual problems, these differences would still be very important, as
vision is the dominant sensory modality for most primates (Martin, 1990; Allman,
1999).
Similarly, none of the paradigms in our data set involve social problems, and
it is possible that the taxonomic differences we have detected will not hold in this
potentially specialized context (see Humphrey, 1976; Cheney & Seyfarth, 1990;
Tooby & Cosmides, 1992). Although there is little data available to address this
question, recent experimental work suggests that the differences might hold.
Chimpanzees, mangabeys, and ringtailed lemurs have all been tested in versions of
Menzel's (1973) deception paradigm, and the sophistication of performance in this
situation corresponds with the results of the present study (Menzel, 1973; Coussi-
Korbel, 1994; Deaner, 2000; Hirata & Matsuzawa, 2001; Güzeldere, Nahmias, &
Deaner, 2002). Similarly, chimpanzees have been shown to take the visual
perspective of conspecifics in a competitive foraging paradigm, whereas capuchin
monkeys failed to show this ability (Hare, Call, Agnetta, & Tomasello, 2000; Hare,
Adessi, Call, Tomasello, & Visalberghi, 2003; for a similar conclusion based on a
different task, see Povinelli, Nelson, & Boysen, 1992; Povinelli, Parks, & Novak,
1992).

Implications
The fact that some genera perform better than others across a range of
paradigms challenges current thinking that taxonomic difference in cognitive abilities
are manifest only in specific contexts (e.g., Tooby & Cosmides, 1992; Shettleworth,
1998; Gallistel, 2000). Nevertheless, our results actually provide little insight into the
nature of the underlying cognitive ability (or abilities) that produce these performance
differences. Indeed, the contentious field of human intelligence testing demonstrates
all too clearly that the meaning of a primary statistical factor, g, is open to numerous
interpretations (reviewed by Mackintosh, 1998; Brody, 2000).
The number of potential explanations is perhaps even greater for the
comparative primate data because cross-species studies raise unique issues. For
instance, rather than accepting that the results found here reflect taxonomic
differences in a single mechanism (or group of inter-related mechanisms), one might
argue that taxa perform well across paradigms because they do in fact have distinct,
restricted abilities, but happen to possess these for most or all of the paradigms in the
data set. The extreme form of this argument ­that each paradigm involves a distinct
ability­ seems unlikely, but it is quite plausible that there might be a few abilities,
each of which supports excellent performance in a few related paradigms. In this
view, the reason that we did not detect superior performance in particular paradigms
or superparadigms is that the same taxa that possess a cognitive ability that allows
them to excel in one paradigm also tend to possess another cognitive ability that
allows them to excel in other paradigms; hence performance is uniformly excellent.
Although this scenario requires that distinct cognitive abilities have generally
undergone correlated evolution, there are theoretical reasons to think that this could
be true (Deaner, Nunn, & van Schaik, 2000; van Schaik & Deaner, 2003). To test this
possibility, data could be gathered on within species variation across tasks; if the
same individuals do well across all tasks, it would support the notion of a primary
domain-general ability (see Crinella & Yu, 1995; Anderson, 2000). Alternatively, if
individuals were shown to have particular domains of expertise, this would be more
consistent with the notion of distinct abilities with distinct mechanistic bases.
Although our result fits with the intuitive, traditional idea that some taxa,
especially great apes, are "more intelligent" than others, our results do not suggest
that we should re-embrace the outdated notion of a scala naturae, wherein species
can be viewed as evolving in a pre-ordained progression, ultimately leading to
humans (Hodos & Campbell, 1969). Instead, they suggest that under some
conditions, there can be selection for fairly generalized cognitive abilities (Balda,
Kamil, & Bednekoff, 1996; Schusterman & Kastak, 1998; Reader & Laland, 2002;
Emery & Clayton, 2004) or else a suite of independent but consistently co-evolving
ones. Although this type of cognitive evolution may have occurred more frequently
in some radiations than in others (i.e., those with slow life history: Deaner, Barton, &
van Schaik, 2002; van Schaik & Deaner, 2003), there are no compelling theoretical
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 179 -
reasons to assume that domain-general cognition is restricted to primates or even
mammals (Balda et al., 1996; Emery & Clayton, 2004).
If taxa do indeed differ in domain-general cognitive abilities, then this could
help explain the distribution of spontaneously occurring complex behavior. Thus, in
primates, the great apes, the best performers across the cognitive paradigms, show
relatively high rates of deception, highly complex manipulation, population-wide tool
use in the wild, and robust mirror self-recognition (Byrne & Whiten, 1992; Tomasello
& Call, 1997; van Schaik et al., 1999; de Veer & van den Bos, 1999; Inoue-
Nakamura, 1997). By contrast, prosimians, which had the overall lowest scores,
exhibit little manual dexterity and no tool use, deception, or mirror self-recognition
(ibid). Future studies will be necessary to determine the robustness of these
taxonomic differences and to test if the global variables also explain variation within
great apes, monkeys, and prosimians.
Finally, the global variables generated in this paper should be useful for
testing the assumptions of comparative neuroanatomical investigations. Such
investigations generally take for granted that a relative measure of the size of the
brain or of a brain structure corresponds with some overall level of information
processing capacity or "intelligence" (Deaner et al., 2000; van Schaik & Deaner,
2003). Researchers can now test which, if any, neuroanatomical measures correspond
to an objective standard, namely the global variables generated in this study.

Appendix A. Studies that fit within the paradigms included in the meta-analysis, but
which, for various reasons, could not be incorporated. Studies are organized by the
paradigm, and, in some cases, the procedure, they correspond with.
Patterned-string problems
Warden, Koch, & Fjeld (1940a) tested Cebus, Ateles, and Macaca in several
unusual problems, but there was no indication of significant or consistent taxonomic
differences.
procedure 4. Cha & King (1969) tested Saimiri on many of the commonly-
used patterns, but subjects had received extensive pre-training and learned problems
until criterion, making proper comparisons impossible.
Invisible displacement
Schino, Spinozzi, & Berlinguer (1990) tested Macaca and Cebus and found
that, although most subjects clearly did not use a representational strategy, there was
evidence that one Cebus subject did so. This study would seem to indicate a
taxonomic difference, but Dumas & Brunet (1994) and de Blois et al. (1998) argue
that the Cebus subject's performance may in fact be accounted for with non-
representational strategies, i.e., associative learning. Supporting this suggestion,
Dumas & Brunet (1994) found that several Cebus were unable to employ
representational strategies.
Tool use
Visalberghi et al. (1995) and Limongelli, Boysen, & Visalberghi (1995) tested
Cebus, Pan and Pongo on tool use tasks besides procedure 2 and suggested that the
great apes outperformed Cebus in some of these. However, in no case was the
evidence of a taxonomic difference unambiguous (Tomasello & Call 1997).
procedure 8. Warden, Koch, & Fjeld (1940b) tested Cebus and Macaca in a
study similar to that of Natale (1989) and also concluded that Cebus outperformed
Macaca. Unfortunately, the subjects' errors were not quantified or fully described,
making comparisons impossible.
procedure 9. Visalberghi et al. (1995) tested other Pan subjects besides the
five noted but we disregarded the performance of these other subjects because, unlike
Cebus, they had previous experience in a similar stick-tube task situation.
Object discrimination learning set
Levine, Levinson, & Harlow (1969) studied Macaca on three trials per
problem and 12 trials per problem, so this study is not comparable with other studies.
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 192 -
Behar (1962a) tested Cercocebus with problems that lasted four, seven, or 10
trials and sometimes had unusual stimuli, so this study is not comparable with other
studies.
Behar (1962b) tested Macaca with procedures similar to those used by Behar
(1962a), but subjects were experienced with learning sets, and the data were not
presented in a manner that it allowed it to be directly compared.
Davenport, Rogers, & Menzel (1969) tested Pan, first with 10 trials per
problem and then with several other unusual procedures. The data were not presented
in a manner that it allowed it to be compared directly with other studies.
Rumbaugh & McQueeney (1963) tested Saimiri using a criterion procedure in
which animals had to score 20 of 25 correct. The data were not presented in a manner
that it allowed it to be combined with other studies.
Yagi & Furusaka (1973) tested Macaca, first with three trials per problem,
then with 18 trials per problem, and finally with six trials per problem; thus, the study
was not directly comparable with others.
Devine (1970) tested Macaca and Cebus using four different procedures but
found no significant taxonomic differences with any of them. The data were not
presented in a manner that it allowed it to be directly compared with other studies.
Hayes, Thompson, & Hayes (1953) tested Pan, first with an unusual criterion
procedure and then with two trials per problem. The data were not presented in a
manner that it allowed it to be compared directly with other studies.
procedure 10. Sterrit, Goodenough, & Harlow (1963) studied Macaca but
most subjects were less than 1/5 AFR, and data were not presented separately for
older subjects.
Riopelle, Alper, Strong, & Ades (1964) tested Macaca but every sixth
problem involved the stimuli presented in an earlier problem, but with the values
reversed.
Rumbaugh, Ternes, & Abordo (1965) tested Saimiri but discrimination
objects were attached to plexi-glass bases, and this appeared to interfere with
learning.
Riopelle & Moon (1968) studied Macaca but did not use a favored food.
procedure 15. Rumbaugh & McCormack (1967) presented data on Saimiri for
the two trials per problem condition, but these subjects apparently did not participate
in the earlier two conditions. Hence, their experience may differ substantially from
the other subjects.
Rumbaugh & McCormack (1967) report data that originally appeared in
Rumbaugh & Price (1962).
procedure 17. Harlow (1950a; see also Harlow, 1949) tested Macaca and
Cercocebus but rewards were provided after every trial. Data on the two taxa were
not presented separately so no comparison was possible.
Darby & Riopelle (1955) studied Macaca, but subjects had preliminary
training with object-discrimination problems.
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 193 -
Schusterman (1962) tested Pan but subjects had extensive experience learning
a single discrimination to criterion.
Fischer (1962) tested Gorilla but subjects were less than 1/5 AFR. Also,
subjects were given a "practice" problem at the beginning of each day.
Cooper (1974) tested Eulemur, but subjects had hundreds of other learning set
problems before beginning testing with the six trial per problem procedure.
Reversal learning
Rumbaugh & McCormack (1967) tested Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Macaca,
but there was no significant taxonomic variation in the reversal to acquisition ratio
(data from table 3; analysis of variance; F(3,19) = 0.83, p = 0.49). They also tested
the one most promising Hylobates subject but, as stated above, we did not consider
non-random subject pools. The inclusion of this subject would not have effected the
conclusion that there is no significant taxonomic variation.
Rumbaugh & Pournelle (1966) compared Saimiri with various Macaca,
Hylobates, Pongo, Gorilla, and Pan. However, the performance of Saimiri subjects
was based on 50 problems, whereas the other subjects' performance was based on the
last 11 problems of a sequence; reversal performance is known to improve with
experience (e.g., Washburn & Rumbaugh, 1991). Furthermore, subjects employed in
the comparisons were not randomly selected from their subject pools.
Cooper (1980) tested Phaner and Microcebus on several types of reversal
problems. However, there were no consistent taxonomic differences, as Phaner
performed better on discrimination reversals, whereas Microcebus did better on
spatial reversals. There were differences in transfer index performance, and these data
were incorporated in the rankings of procedure 6 in the main data set.
procedure 19. Harlow (1950b) tested Macaca and Cercocebus but used seven,
nine, or 11 trials. Cercocebus completed more consecutive problems correctly, but
the difference did not reach statistical significance; there were no other independent
measures presented to test for a consistent difference.
Delayed Response
Jolly (1964) tested Galago and Eulemur in delayed response but only two of
nine subjects performed significantly above chance with zero second delays,
indicating that this was not a suitable paradigm for making comparisons.
Harlow (1932) considered Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, Macaca, Papio,
Mandrillus, and Hylobates on three kinds of "complicated delayed reaction tests."
There was some interspecific variation on these problems, but it was not significant
or consistent within or across problem types.
procedure 28. Maslow & Harlow (1932) provided limited data on one
Eulemur, but we were unable to include this subject, because it was not tested until its
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 194 -
performance decreased substantially. Furthermore, this subject performed worse
(67%) than nearly all subjects with delays of zero seconds, suggesting it was not
adequately acclimated to the paradigm to offer a meaningful test.
Harlow & Bromer (1939) provided data on Cebus and Ateles, but subjects
were first trained to criterion performance at 15 seconds; because experience
improves performance (e.g., Miles 1957a, b), this information cannot be combined
with that of Harlow et al. (1932) or Maslow & Harlow (1932). There was no
consistent or significant variation between Cebus and Ateles, so this study could not
constitute its own procedure.
French (1959) provided data on Saimiri but subjects were first trained to
criterion performance at 10 seconds. Moreover, the data were not presented in a
manner that it allowed it to be directly compared with other studies
Yagi & Furusaka 1973 tested Macaca but, unlike in Harlow et al. (1932) and
Maslow & Harlow (1932), subjects were not experimentally naïve prior to the
beginning of testing. Furthermore, no information was provided on the inter-trial
interval or the number of problems presented per day, so it is unclear if these aspects
were comparable to other studies.
procedure 29. Berkson (1962) tested Hylobates, but subjects had previous
training with delayed response problems and experienced 12 trials per day. Also, only
delays of 20 seconds and less were given.
Oddity
Davis et al. (1967) administered two other tests besides those encompassing
procedure 25, but these were designed to detect perceptual differences, not
differences in using the oddity concept.
Rumbaugh & McCormack (1967) tested Pan, Pongo, Gorilla, and Macaca on
100 one-trial problems. However, after excluding underage subjects, we found no
evidence of significant taxonomic variation (analysis of variance: F(3,10) = 2.30; p =
0.14].

Appendix B. Cognitive paradigms that could not be included in the sample and the
reasons why.
"Basic" learning processes
Habituation, classical conditioning, and instrumental conditioning have been
extensively studied in primates. However, researchers investigating these phenomena
have been generally unconcerned with taxonomic variation, and so far there is scant
evidence for it, at least among nonhuman primates (Warren, 1965, 1974; Brookshire
1970a, b; Ehrlich et al., 1976; Macphail, 1982).
Cooperation in a pulling task
Several studies have examined the extent to which subjects can coordinate
their behavior with a partner on a task where subjects are each required to pull a
separate handle simultaneously. Cebus, Pan, and Pongo have been tested by
Chalmeau and colleagues (Chalmeau & Gallo, 1996; Chalmeau, Lardeux, Brandibas,
& Gallo, 1997; Chalmeau, Visalberghi, & Gallo, 1997), who concluded that Cebus
differed from Pan and Pongo in failing to take into account the partners' behavior.
However, the procedures differed somewhat between the studies. Furthermore,
Mendres & de Waal (2000) have provided evidence that on some variations of the
task, Cebus can coordinate its behavior with its partner's (see also Visalberghi,
Quarantotti, & Tranchida, 2000). Thus, there is presently inconclusive evidence for
taxonomic differences in this task.
Weigl matching problems
Nissen, Blum, & Blum (1949) and Harlow (1936) tested Pan and Macaca,
respectively, on conditional matching problems. Overall, Macaca performed better
than Pan (Harlow, 1951). However, comparisons are complicated by the fact that the
Macaca subjects had previous experience on these types of problems, and the
apparatuses and procedures differed between the studies (Nissen et al., 1949).
Furthermore, apparently no other genera have been studied in this paradigm, meaning
that it would not meet our minimum of three genera per paradigm
Middleness
Rohles & Devine (1966, 1967) showed that one Pan subject could learn the
concept of "middleness", because it learned to pick the middle object out of an array
of up to 17 objects. They also reported that Macaca could only pick the middle object
in much smaller arrays, suggesting taxonomic variation. However, the number of
Macaca subjects studied, their ages, and the details of their trials were not reported,
Meta-analysis of Primate Cognition
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 196 -
making comparisons tenuous. Furthermore, apparently no other genera have been
studied in this paradigm, meaning that it would not meet our minimum of three
genera per paradigm.
Role Reversal
Povinelli, Nelson, & Boysen (1992) and Povinelli, Parks, & Novak (1992)
investigated the behavior of Pan and Macaca in a task where subjects cooperated
with humans to gain a reward. When the roles in the task were reversed, Pan more
readily practiced their new roles. Although indicative of a taxonomic difference, it is
unclear if the previous experience of Macaca subjects allowed them to communicate
with humans as well as Pan subjects did (Tomasello & Call, 1997). In addition,
apparently no other genera have been studied in this paradigm, meaning that it would
not meet our minimum of three genera per paradigm.
Transfer of reversal learning to learning sets
Schusterman (1962), Warren (1966), Schrier (1966), and Ricciardi &
Treichler (1970) have studied the capacity for subjects to show exceptional learning
set formation performance after experience with reversal problems. Pan, Macaca, and
Saimiri have been considered in this paradigm, and Fobes & King (1982) suggest that
Pan performed better than Macaca. However, the genera have all been tested with
substantially different procedures, especially in the reversal phase; thus, comparisons
are not justified.
