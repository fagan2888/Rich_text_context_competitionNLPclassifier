Abstract
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to the ability to test for multiple cancer susceptibility genes simultaneously
without significantly increasing cost or turnaround time. With growing usage of multigene testing for inherited cancer, ongoing
education for nurses and other health-care providers about hereditary cancer screening is imperative to ensure appropriate
testing candidate identification, test selection, and posttest management. The purpose of this review article is to (1) provide an
overview of how NGS works to detect germline mutations, (2) summarize the benefits and limitations of multigene panel
testing, (3) describe risk categories of cancer susceptibility genes, and (4) highlight the counseling considerations for patients
pursuing multigene testing.

The field of genetic testing for inherited cancer is rapidly
evolving. Identification of BRCA1 and BRCA2 paved the way
for personalized medicine and created a new paradigm for
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome diag-
nosis and prevention (Easton, Ford, & Bishop, 1995; Ford
et al., 1998). Likewise, discovery of the molecular basis of
Lynch syndrome led to a clearer definition of the syndrome's
clinical spectrum and improved our ability to identify individ-
uals at high risk of hereditary colon and endometrial cancers
(Espenschied et al., 2017). Identification of mutation carriers is
critical, as it enables the administration of interventions that
are proven to confer significant survival benefits, particularly
for highly penetrant genetic mutations (Domchek, Friebel,
et al., 2010).
Beyond these two well-known syndromes, numerous other
genes associated with hereditary cancer syndromes have been
identified in recent years. Concurrently, advances in next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technology have made it possible
to test multiple genes simultaneously. Inherited cancer testing
is now being offered by a variety of specialists in a multitude of
clinical settings for both affected and unaffected individuals
(Bellcross et al., 2011).
Genetic counseling and testing is often performed by health-
care providers with specialized training in clinical genetics.
These providers include board-certified genetic counselors,
board-certified clinical geneticists, and advanced practice
genetic nurses who are certified by the American Nursing
Credentialing Center based on minimum practice hours within
the specialty and continuing education hours (www.nursecre
dentialing.org). However, because of their consistent and sus-
tained interactions with patients, nurses of various backgrounds
are well positioned to educate, support, and advocate for
patients throughout the genetic testing process by effectively
obtaining family histories, identifying test candidates, helping
patients and families understand results, and incorporating
genetic test results into ongoing care (Calzone et al., 2010).
All registered nurses have received broad training in genetics,
while master's-level nurses achieve a more rigorous set of
genetic and genomic proficiencies (www.ncsbn.org), but given
the rapid changes in this field, ongoing education is imperative.
This article reviews how multigene testing is performed using
NGS technology and highlights counseling considerations
associated with multigene hereditary cancer testing.

previous standard, Sanger sequencing, one molecule is
sequenced at a time (Sanger, Nicklen, & Coulson, 1977).
Despite their stark differences in throughput, Sanger sequen-
cing and NGS share a similar molecular foundation: Both
utilize the cell's own DNA-copying process to elucidate the
sequence of a targeted portion of the genome (Figure 1).
A single cycle of NGS involves (1) single-base extension (such
that every piece of DNA is now fluorescent at its terminus with
Figure 1. Traditional Sanger sequencing compared with next-generation sequencing technology. In each method, dyed, unextendable bases are
utilized to create a fluorescent signal that can be translated into a sequence of nucleotides. Subtle differences in the two methods lead to vast
differences in throughput. This image was reproduced from figure 1 in Muzzey, Evans, and Lieber (2015). It is licensed under Creative Commons

a color corresponding to the terminal base), (2) imaging of the
fluorescence color at every position on the glass slide, and
(3) recycling of the terminal bases such that they are no longer
fluorescent and can undergo extension again. NGS sequencers
can perform hundreds of such cycles, yielding millions of
DNA-fragment sequences, each up to several hundred bases
in length. Although at the molecular level NGS and Sanger
technologies subtly differ, this difference makes NGS clini-
cally groundbreaking. NGS throughput and quality has greatly
decreased both the cost and time involved in sequencing,
allowing patients access to testing for multiple genes at a frac-
tion of the cost of traditional single-gene testing.
Depth of Coverage on NGS
The goal of genetic testing is to resolve the sequence of a
patient's genes such that any pathogenic mutations can be
identified. Therefore, it is important to sequence molecules
originating from each chromosome many times over to have
confidence in the result. Depth, or coverage, refers to the num-
ber of sequenced fragments that are generated from a given site
in the genome or simply the number of times a certain base was
sequenced. In general, as depth increases, so does the confi-
dence that the identified mutation is real. Most commercial
laboratories establish a minimum depth between 20Â and
50Â for targeted inherited cancer panels, which means that at
each genomic position, a base is read at least 20­50 times
(Chong et al., 2014; Judkins et al., 2015; Lincoln et al., 2015;
Vysotskaia et al., 2017).
Variant Identification and Classification
Pathogenic mutations can occur when nucleotides, varying
from a single base to thousands, are altered, inserted, or deleted
(Figure 2). Any sequencing method used for clinical testing
must be able to identify this wide variety of mutation types
that can lead to human disease. Once a genetic alteration is
identified, a laboratory must then determine the biological sig-
nificance of that alteration through the process of variant cura-
tion. The American College of Medical Genetics and
Genomics (ACMG) sets standards for classifying genetic
alterations into five categories: pathogenic, likely pathogenic,
uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. These clas-
sifications are based on multiple lines of evidence including
public and private databases as well as population, computa-
tional, functional, segregation, de novo, and allelic data
(Richards et al., 2015). Because of the difficulty of developing
rigid guidelines that encompass all nuances of genetic varia-
tion, there is the potential for differences in classifications
between laboratories, and based on analysis of public database
submissions, such differences in classification have occurred
(Gradishar, Johnson, Brown, Mundt, & Manley, 2017). How-
ever, authors report overall high interlaboratory concordance
for hereditary cancer results when the clinical actionability of a
variant and quality of a database submission is considered
(Lincoln et al., 2017). Concordance will continue to increase
with ongoing data sharing efforts among researchers and
commercial laboratories. Genomic data sharing, through con-
tribution to public databases such as ClinVar (www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/clinvar), is supported by ACMG as a crucial practice
in improving genomic health care (ACMG Board of Directors,
2017).
Confirmation of NGS Findings
In its early usage, NGS was limited by low depth of coverage
and error rates that were unsuitable for routine clinical testing.
Confirmation of results through traditional methods, such as
Sanger sequencing, was common laboratory practice. Although
NGS can now be optimized for low error rates and high depth
of coverage, some laboratories still rely on orthogonal confir-
mation of positive findings (Chong et al., 2014; Judkins et al.,
2015; Lincoln et al., 2015; Vysotskaia et al., 2017). In a recent
study, authors analyzed data from 20,000 clinical samples
Figure 2. Next-generation sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome demonstrate two mutation types: a single-nucleotide polymorph-
ism where a guanine has replaced a thymine and, further downstream, a deletion of an adenine. Depth of coverage of 3Â, 5Â, and 8Â indicates
the number of reads at each position. This image was adapted from figure 2 in Muzzey, Evans, and Lieber (2015). It is licensed under Creative

tested at one commercial laboratory and claimed the necessity
of utilizing Sanger sequencing to confirm variants detected by
NGS (Mu, Lu, Chen, Li, & Elliott, 2016). However, many other
reports have demonstrated that NGS alone produces results
with high sensitivity and specificity and that the need for ortho-
gonal confirmation is dependent on the specific NGS assay and
is not a general limitation of all NGS protocols (Beck,
Mullikin, & Biesecker, 2016; Lincoln et al., 2015; Vysotskaia
et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the purpose of orthogonal confirma-
tion is to reduce false positives. It is important, therefore, for
laboratories to establish a protocol for addressing the potential
for such results, especially in difficult-to-sequence regions of
the genome, and to demonstrate the efficacy of these protocols
in published validation studies (Mu et al., 2016).
Assessing Quality of NGS Testing
The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendment program stipulates stan-
dards for analytic validity of NGS assays but does not address
the accuracy of individual aspects of these methods such as
depth of coverage, bioinformatics for variant calling, results
interpretation, or reporting (Robson et al., 2015). Most com-
mercially available assays report greater than 99% sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy but use varying methods to achieve
this standard (Chong et al., 2014; Judkins et al., 2015; Lincoln
et al., 2015; Vysotskaia et al., 2017). Experts call for clinicians
to carefully select a laboratory for testing but give little gui-
dance for how to assess laboratory quality (Fecteau, Vogel,
Hanson, & Morrill-Cornelius, 2014). Laboratories can demon-
strate their test performance through a published validation
study. Analytical sensitivity, analytic specificity, repeatability,
and reproducibility are all characteristics that a test validation
should establish (Rehm et al., 2013).
Overview of Multigene Testing
Multigene testing for cancer susceptibility became commer-
cially available in 2012 (Dalton & Thompson, 2015). Although
many laboratories now offer these tests using similar NGS
technologies, panel design (e.g., panel size, how genes are
selected for inclusion, design of syndrome-specific panels) can
vary greatly between laboratories (Cragun et al., 2014;
Domchek, Bradbury, Garber, Offit, & Robson, 2013; Hall
et al., 2016; Slavin et al., 2015). The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends consideration of multi-
gene testing when a patient's personal and/or family history is
suggestive of an inherited cancer syndrome that could be caused
by more than one gene or when an individual has tested negative
for a single syndrome, but their personal and/or family history
remains suggestive of an inherited cause (NCCN, 2017). How-
ever, due to decreasing cost and turnaround time, multigene
panels are more often being used as a first-line test for any
patient suspected to have an inherited cancer syndrome.
Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most recognized her-
editary cancer genes, mutations in these genes only account for
50% of all hereditary breast cancer (Kapoor et al., 2015).
Multiple studies have demonstrated that multigene testing
identifies more individuals with hereditary breast cancer than
testing for BRCA1/2 alone. For individuals suspected of having
hereditary breast cancer who previously tested negative for
BRCA1/2, testing for additional genes results in a positive
result in 2.9­11.4% of cases (Desmond et al., 2015; Kapoor
et al., 2015; Kurian et al., 2014; Maxwell et al., 2015; Thomp-
son et al., 2016; Tung, Lin, et al., 2016; Yorczyk, Robinson, &
Ross, 2015).
Another common indication for hereditary cancer testing is a
personal or family history of colon cancer. In the first large clin-
ical series of patients tested for inherited colorectal cancer (CRC)
with multigene panel testing, 10% of high-risk patients tested
positive for a mutation in 1 of the 14 genes associated with nine
CRC syndromes; the majority of these results were expected to
change clinical management (Cragun et al., 2014). In a larger,
subsequent series, 1,260 patients with suspected Lynch syndrome
were tested using a 25-gene panel, and 185 (14.6%) were found to
haveapathogenicmutation;38% ofmutationswereinnon-Lynch
syndrome genes (Yurgelun et al., 2015).
Overlapping phenotypes and complex guidelines may lead
to patients being missed with the traditional single-gene testing
approach. In a study of 9,000 individuals referred for hereditary
cancer testing, 30% of patients tested for Lynch syndrome also
met criteria for HBOC testing, and inversely, 7% of patients
sent for HBOC testing also met criteria for Lynch syndrome
testing (Saam et al., 2015). Multigene tests may offer a simpli-
fied and efficient option for clinicians needing to select appro-
priate genes for a given patient. A growing body of evidence
also suggests that adhering to a guidelines-based approach,
testing solely for a gene or syndrome for which a patient meets
criteria, can lead to missed mutations. In a study of 475 patients
referred for genetic counseling and testing at an academic cen-
ter, 15.6% were positive for a mutation identified through mul-
tigene testing (Ricker et al., 2016). Based on provider-recorded
differential diagnoses, the authors determined that nearly half
of these mutations (47.3%) would have been missed with a
single-gene, stepwise approach. The potential missed muta-
tions included those in high-penetrance genes with atypical
presentations as well as those in moderate-penetrance genes
where the phenotype is less well defined. Other studies have
reported similar findings, with 6.6­17% of individuals referred
for multigene testing being found to carry a pathogenic muta-
tion in at least one gene (LaDuca et al., 2014; Selkirk et al.,
2014; Slavin et al., 2015; Susswein et al., 2016).
Despite the advantages of multigene testing, some argue that
new DNA testing technology is outpacing evidence for clinical
utility and consideration of proper implementation. Multigene
tests may include genes with ill-defined lifetime cancer risks,
unclear clinical management guidance, and increased rates of
results with uncertain significance (Axilbund, 2016; Domchek
et al., 2013; Robson et al., 2015). Further carefully designed
studies with large sample sizes are needed to demonstrate the
clinical validity and clinical utility of multigene testing (Easton
et al., 2015).
Price et al. 195
Categories of Risk
Cancer predisposition genes included on multigene tests can be
grouped into three categories of disease penetrance: high, mod-
erate, and low. There is also a growing category of genes that
have been associated with risk of cancer, but the magnitude of
this risk is unknown due to limited available data.
The likelihoods of the development of cancer due to genetic
mutations can be discussed in terms of relative risk (RR) or
lifetime risk (LTR). RR, also called a risk ratio, is the like-
lihood of an event's occurrence in one group compared with
that in another group. For example, the RR of developing breast
cancer for a PALB2 mutation carrier is 5.3 (Easton et al., 2015),
meaning that a woman with a pathogenic PALB2 mutation is
5.3 times more likely to develop breast cancer compared to a
woman in the general population. Absolute risk refers to the
probability of an event happening over a defined period of
time, for example, the likelihood of breast cancer manifestation
in the next 5 years or over a lifetime.
Calculations of lifetime cancer risks are influenced by risk
factors, such as family history, environmental exposures, or
hormonal factors, and can overestimate risk of genes where
risk ratio may decrease as carriers age (Easton et al., 2015).
However, absolute risks may be more relevant in clinical prac-
tice since guidelines cite 5-year risk and LTR in recommenda-
tions for interventions such as chemoprevention and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) screening for breast cancer (Saslow
et al., 2007). Table 1 displays a list of genes commonly found
on multigene cancer tests and respective lifetime cancer risks.
It is important to note that individuals who test negative for a
genetic mutation may still have an elevated risk of cancer based
on personal or family history. Multiple risk models are avail-
able to calculate breast cancer risk in families who do not
harbor an identifiable mutation (e.g., Claus model, Claus,
Risch, & Thompson, 1994, Tyrer­Cuzick model). However,
current risk models have limitations, and it is important to
understand the specific limitations of each model when calcu-
lating risk of a given patient (Amir, Freedman, Seruga, &
Evans, 2010).
Although risk categories are somewhat arbitrary, high pene-
trance describes genes conferring an RR greater than 4 times
the risk of the general population (Easton et al., 2015). Exam-
ples include BRCA1 (RR 11.4, LTR 46­87%) and PALB2 (RR
5.3, LTR 17­58%). Moderate-penetrance genes confer an RR
2­4 times the general population risk. Examples include
CHEK2 (RR 3.0, LTR 26­56%) and ATM (RR 2.8, 7­52%;
Easton et al., 2015). Genes that confer cancer risks less than 2
times the general population risk may be referred to as low-
penetrance genes or risk alleles. Most commercially available
multigene tests include only moderate- and high-penetrance
genes. However, not all mutations within a moderate- or
high-penetrance gene confer equal risks of cancer. For exam-
ple, a common mutation in CHEK2, 1100delC, confers an
approximate 3-fold RR of breast cancer (Weischer, Bojesen,
Ellervik, Tybjærg-Hansen, & Nordestgaard, 2008), but another
well-documented mutation in the same gene, I157T, is
associated with only a 1.58-fold RR of breast cancer (Han,
Guo, & Liu, 2013).
Although it is controversial, many commercially available
inherited cancer panels also include genes with limited or
conflicting evidence for association with cancer risk and the
magnitude of that risk. For example, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1
(MRN) complex, which includes the genes MRE11A, RAD50,
and NBN, is involved in double-strand break repairs. Data have
shown that mutations in genes that make up the MRN complex
confer either a moderately increased risk of breast cancer
(Damiola et al., 2014) or no increased risk (Couch et al.,
2017). All three genes are included on many multigene cancer
tests, but currently, only the NBN gene has corresponding con-
sensus guidelines for management (NCCN, 2017). More stud-
ies are needed to establish the appropriate evidence threshold
for inclusion of a specific gene in clinical testing.
Counseling Considerations
Although NGS technology has brought significant benefit to
clinical genetics, genetic counseling in the era of panel testing
can be more complex than for single-gene testing. These com-
plexities come in the form of new challenges but more com-
monly stem from traditional challenges in genetic counseling
that are amplified by testing for many genes simultaneously. It
is important that all clinicians who order hereditary cancer
panels are equipped with the knowledge to navigate these com-
plexities, stay up to date with rapidly changing guidelines, and
maintain a network of genetics professionals to refer patients to
when required.
Pretest Education and Informed Consent Considerations
The informed consent process for genetic testing, whether for
single-gene testing or multigene testing, requires the same
basic elements: description of its purpose, general information
about the genes being tested, potential test results, accuracy,
financial considerations, potential for genetic discrimination,
confidentiality, actionability of test results for patient and fam-
ily members, psychological implications of a test result, and
alternatives to genetic testing (Riley et al., 2012). Health-care
providers or genetics professionals may want to consider mod-
ifying this traditional approach to informed consent in the case
of multigene testing to ensure that patients have a high-level
understanding of the genes for which they are being tested as
well as a heightened awareness of the potential to find an
unexpected, uncertain, or unclear result (Robson et al., 2015).
Pretest counseling for single-gene or single-syndrome test-
ing historically included a comprehensive discussion of the
hereditary cancer gene(s) for which the patient is being tested.
For example, a candidate for Lynch syndrome testing may have
formerly received a detailed explanation of each of the genes
associated with Lynch syndrome, the cancer risks associated
with a positive result in each gene, as well as the medical
management guidelines for carriers. In order to remain
effective, pretest counseling for multigene tests requires

modification since it is not feasible to have a comprehensive
discussion about each gene on a large panel (Robson et al.,
2015). Instead, bucketing genes into categories of risk can
provide the necessary education without information overload
(Table 2; Fecteau et al., 2014).
Discussing the potential for uncertain findings has been an
integral part of pretest education and informed consent since
the beginning of clinical testing for hereditary cancer (Petru-
celli, Lazebnik, Huelsman, & Lazebnik, 2002). In 2002, the
variant of uncertain significance (VUS) rate for BRCA1 and
BRCA2 alone was as high as 12.8%, but it decreased to 2.1% as
knowledge accumulated on the effects of specific genetic
alterations (Eggington et al., 2014). The likelihood for a VUS
to be identified on a multigene cancer test varies based on many
factors including the number of genes tested, the quantity of the
region of interest being sequenced (i.e., how much of the
introns, or noncoding region, is included), and the ethnic diver-
sity of the population being tested, but it can range from 19.7%
to 42% (Selkirk et al., 2014; Slavin et al., 2015). Preparing
patients for the possibility of an uncertain result prior to testing
may help to normalize this result and alleviate patient anxiety
when a VUS is identified. It is important to recognize that, as
labs and clinicians collaborate and participate in broad data
sharing practices, VUS rates will continue to decrease, which
will benefit patient care in genetics (ACMG Board of
Directors, 2017).
The potential for genetic discrimination is another aspect of
pretest counseling that is not new but has become a more
important issue as more individuals, particularly those who
have not had cancer, gain access to genetic testing services.
Multigene tests are more likely to return a positive result than
single-gene tests and therefore may introduce more potential
for genetic discrimination. The Genetic Information Nondiscri-
mination Act (GINA) is a federal law passed in 2008 that
provides protections against genetic discrimination in health
insurance and employment. The law disallows use of genetic
information by a health insurer to make determinations about
premiums and states that health insurers may not require sub-
scribers undergo genetic testing. The law does have some
limitations in its protections. For example, GINA does not
apply to life insurance, long-term care insurance, or disability
insurance. It also does not apply to employers with fewer than
15 employees, members of the U.S. military, veterans acces-
sing health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, or federal employees enrolled in the Federal
Employees Health Benefits program (The GINA, 2008). The
Affordable Care Act, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, and numerous state laws provide addi-
tional protections against genetic discrimination in health
insurance (National Human Genome Research Institute,
2017). It is important to discuss the protections, and the limita-
tions in protections, with patients prior to their undergoing
genetic testing.
Posttest Counseling Considerations
Posttest, a discussion with a patient on results includes sensi-
tivity, specificity, and limitations of the test; the patient's can-
cer risks based on the result; medical management
recommendations; and implications for family members.
Referral to other health-care providers as well as assessment
of psychological impacts and provision of emotional support
can also be vital parts of this process (Riley et al., 2012).
Similar to pretest counseling, posttest counseling with multi-
gene testing is at the core very similar to that for single-gene
testing, but it does pose a few unique challenges.
Identifying unexpected results. While rare, "unexpected findings"
occur when individuals test positive for a mutation in a gene
that is not associated with their personal or family history. For
example, pathogenic mutations in CDH1 are associated with
increased risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer and lobular
breast cancer (Pharoah, Guilford, Caldas, & the International
Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium, 2001), and experts rec-
ommend genetic testing in families that have multiple cases of
diffuse gastric cancer, diffuse gastric cancer diagnosed in an
individual younger than 40 years of age, or individuals with a
personal history of both diffuse gastric cancer and lobular
Table 2. Examples of Risk Categories to Aid in Simplification of Pretest Counseling in the Case of Multigene Testing.

Many options, which may
include increased

chemopreventiona
Options generally involve increased
screening beginning at younger ages
Established guidelines not yet available;
clinician will make recommendations
based on current data and the patient's
personal and family medical history
Implications for family
members
Recommend testing to all
blood relatives. Negative
results are considered
"true negative" results
Family members should consider genetic
testing; family members with negative
results may still have increased risk of
cancer based on the family history
Unknown implications for family members
aIt is important to discuss limitations in cancer screening and prevention. It is not possible to effectively screen for all cancer risks conferred by a high-penetrance
gene. For example, TP53 mutations cause risk of many cancer types, and screening options are of unknown efficacy.

breast cancer (Fitzgerald et al., 2010). However, since
pan-cancer multigene tests have become available, there have
been multiple case reports of patients found to carry pathogenic
mutations in CDH1 with no reported personal or family history
of diffuse gastric cancer (Huynh & Laukaitis 2016). Risks of
cancer and guidelines for management of individuals with
CDH1 mutations were developed based on data from families
with significant histories of gastric cancer. It is unclear whether
CDH1 carriers without a significant history have the same risks
and should be managed in the same way. The conservative
approach, guided by studies of BRCA mutations identified in
low-risk families (Gabai-Kapara et al., 2014), assumes the
same level of cancer risk of any CDH1 mutation carrier, but
more studies are needed to better understand the appropriate
management of these individuals and individuals in other fam-
ilies with unexpected findings from multigene testing.
Pathogenic mutations in multiple genes. Multigene testing intro-
duces the possibility of identifying pathogenic mutations in
multiple genes in one individual. In a cohort of more than
2,000 patients, investigators found that 2.9% carried two patho-
genic mutations (LaDuca et al., 2014). Although this finding
suggests that individuals with known familial mutations iden-
tified by single-gene testing may still benefit from a multigene
test, limited data exist to guide the management of individuals
with more than one inherited cancer predisposition syndrome.
Large, prospective studies are needed to define cancer risks in
individuals who carry mutations in two or more genes, so that
appropriate management recommendations can be developed.
In the meantime, management of both syndromes according to
their independent guidelines is a reasonable approach.
Management and moderate-penetrance genes. Many moderate-
penetrance genes, like CHEK2, were discovered long before
clinical testing of these genes was common (Meijers-Heijboer
et al., 2002). With single-gene testing, limited value was out-
weighed by incremental cost. NGS technology allows these
genes to be included in multigene tests with little additional
cost. While the addition of moderate-penetrance genes to mul-
tigene cancer tests preceded the existence of clinical manage-
ment guidelines, experts have now established a framework for
counseling carriers about their risk (NCCN, 2017; Tung,
Domchek, et al., 2016). However, while guidelines for manag-
ing carriers develop, establishment of cancer risks of family
members remains challenging. Prior studies support that when
a family member tests negative for a known familial high-
penetrance mutation, like a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, they
are considered to be a "true negative" and their risk of cancer
approaches that of the general population regardless of family
history (Domchek, Gaudet, et al., 2010). It may not be appro-
priate to apply this same approach to moderate-penetrance
genes. Moderate-penetrance genes, like ATM, may not account
for all cancer risk in a family, as gene/gene and gene/environ-
ment interactions may also contribute (NCCN, 2017). For this
reason, family members who test negative for a familial
moderate-penetrance mutation may still have an increased risk
of cancer based on their personal and family history and should
be counseled accordingly (Tung, Domchek, et al., 2016).
Inclusion of genes with limited or conflicting evidence of
cancer risk can pose additional challenges to multigene testing.
Consensus guidelines state that genetic testing is most appro-
priate when results of testing will have a direct impact on the
medical management of the patient or their family members
(NCCN, 2017). Therefore, genetic testing with a guidelines-
based panel is a reasonable approach. Genes that have uncer-
tain clinical utility should be included in clinical testing with
caution, and the involvement of a provider with expertise in
cancer genetics and risk assessment is important in these cir-
cumstances (Robson et al., 2015).
Counseling about variants of uncertain significance. Rates for VUS
identified on multigene hereditary cancer panels range from
19.7% to 42% (Selkirk et al., 2014; Slavin et al., 2015), with
one report of a VUS rate of 88% for a 42-gene panel (Kurian
et al., 2014). Although multigene panels have higher VUS rates
than traditional single-gene testing, posttest counseling and
management of patients with VUS identified with either tech-
nology are similar. Because most VUS results that are reclas-
sified are found to be benign, VUS results should not be used to
alter clinical management (Easton et al., 2007). Instead, a
patient with a VUS should receive individualized recommen-
dations based on their personal and family history (NCCN,

Price et al. 199
2017). Providers can encourage patients to enroll in research
studies that are working collaboratively toward improved inter-
pretation of genetic variants such as ClinGen (www.clinicalgen
ome.org), PROMPT (www.promptstudy.info), ENIGMA
(www.enigmaconsortium.org), or InSIGHT (www.insight-
group.org).
Counseling for reproductive risks. Discussion of reproductive risks
with carriers is another complex issue that is not unique to, but
may be increasing in frequency because of, multigene testing.
Many genes cause increased risk of cancer when carriers inherit
one mutation from one parent but lead to a different genetic
syndrome when they inherit two mutations, one from each par-
ent. Reproductive risks should be discussed with carriers of
mutations in the genes in Table 3, and carriers should be made
aware of the availability of partner testing to clarify the risk of
conceiving a child with a clinically distinct genetic condition.
Ongoing Communication
Providers ordering hereditary cancer testing of any type must
be aware of changing guidelines, and this imperative is espe-
cially true for multigene panel testing. Patients' family his-
tories, guidelines for testing criteria, interpretation of
variants, and management recommendations for mutation car-
riers are all evolving. Clinicians must establish a protocol to
ensure that patients have access to current recommendations
surrounding their hereditary cancer risk.
Conclusions
Multigene testing allows for increased detection of hereditary
cancer syndromes by utilizing the benefits of high-throughput
NGS. Genetic counseling complexities may arise on a more
frequent basis with panel testing; however, these challenges
are not novel to counseling for inherited cancer. Nurses of all
levels and specialties can play an integral role in identifying,
testing, and managing patients with inherited risk of cancer. All
health-care professionals who offer inherited cancer testing
must engage in ongoing education as the field is continuously
evolving as new data become available. Future research oppor-
tunities are many in this field and include analysis of clinical
utility for moderate-penetrance genes, delineation of cancer
risks and management for individuals positive for mutations
in multiple genes, development of robust standards to assess
lab quality, and data collection to further refine cancer risks
conferred by more newly described genes, especially in diverse
populations. While these data will undoubtedly improve upon
the usefulness of multigene testing, the current landscape rep-
resents an opportunity to expand the number of individuals who
can receive timely and appropriate clinical guidance.
