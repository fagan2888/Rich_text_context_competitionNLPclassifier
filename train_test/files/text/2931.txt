Research Question
Banks with deteriorating earnings are said to be prone to taking risks. One kind of risk
that banks can well control is the interest rate risk, which arises from different fixed
interest periods on the asset and liability side of a bank's balance sheet. In the present
paper, we theoretically and empirically investigate whether banks in a stressed earnings
situation behave differently to the other banks concerning their exposure to interest rate
risk. This issue is relevant in the context of the low interest rate environment which can
lead to a massive reduction in banks' earnings.
Contribution
Normally, the demand for a risky asset increases if its expected return goes up. In our
theoretical model, we show that the opposite outcome is possible as well, meaning that
the risky asset becomes the more coveted the lower its expected return. In the paper,
we interpret the risky asset as the exposure to interest rate risk. In our empirical study
for the banks in Germany, we investigate the relationship between a bank's exposure to
interest rate risk, the bank's earning situation and the expected returns from bearing
interest rate risk for the period 2005-2014.
Results
We find a pronounced co-movement between a banks' exposure to interest rate risk and
the corresponding expected return, i.e. a bank will increase the difference between the
repricing periods on its assets and liabilities if the expected return from bearing interest
rate risk increases. This relationship becomes weaker if a bank's earning situation deteri-
orates. If the earnings fall below a certain threshold, the relationship even changes its
sign: We observe, depending on the sample specification and estimation methodology, in
about 0.6 to 8.3 per cent of the events in our sample that a bank increases its exposure
to interest rate risk even though the expected returns from bearing this risk are falling.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Fragestellung
Banken, deren Ertragslage sich verschlechtert, gelten als anfällig dafür, erhöhte Risiken
einzugehen. Ein Risiko, das sich aus Sicht der Bank gut steuern lässt, ist das Zinsände-
rungsrisiko, das sich aus den unterschiedlichen Zinsbindungsfristen auf der Aktiv- und
Passivseite der Bankbilanz ergibt. Im vorliegenden Papier wird theoretisch und empirisch
untersucht, ob Banken mit schlechter Ertragslage sich anders als die übrigen Banken ver-
halten, was das Eingehen von Zinsänderungsrisiken anbelangt. Diese Fragestellung ist im
Hinblick auf das Niedrigzinsumfeld relevant, das zu einer Verschlechterung der Ertragslage
der Banken führen kann.
Beitrag
Normalerweise steigt die Nachfrage nach einem riskanten Anlageobjekt, wenn dessen er-
wartete Rendite ansteigt. In unserem theoretischen Modell zeigen wir, dass auch das
gegenteilige Verhalten vorkommen kann, dass also das riskante Anlageobjekt umso be-
gehrter wird, je geringer seine erwartete Rendite ist. In dem Papier setzen wir das riskan-
te Anlageobjekt mit dem Eingehen von Zinsänderungsrisiken gleich. In einer empirischen
Studie für die Banken in Deutschland, untersuchen wir den Zusammenhang zwischen dem
Zinsänderungsrisiko einer Bank, ihrer Ertragslage und den erwarteten Erträgen aus dem
Zinsänderungsrisiko für den Zeitraum 2005 bis 2014.
Ergebnisse
Wir finden einen stark gleichlaufenden Zusammenhang zwischen dem Eingehen von Zins-
änderungsrisiken und den damit verbundenen erwarteten Erträgen, d.h. eine Bank wird
die Unterschiede der Zinsbindungsfristen auf ihrer Aktiv- und Passivseite vergrößern,
wenn die erwarteten Erträge aus dem Eingehen von Zinsänderungsrisiken ansteigen. Da-
rüber hinaus zeigt sich, dass dieser Zusammenhang schwächer wird, wenn sich die Er-
tragslage der Bank verschlechtert. Fallen die Erträge unter eine bestimmte Schwelle,
dann dreht sich der Zusammenhang sogar um: Wir beobachten, abhängig von der Spezi-
fikation der Stichprobe und dem Schätzmodell, in ungefähr 0,6 bis 8,3 Prozent der Fälle
in unserer Stichprobe, dass eine Bank vermehrt Zinsänderungsrisiken eingeht, obwohl die
erwarten Erträge aus der Übernahme dieses Risikos fallen.

Banks' Interest Rate Risk and Search for Yield:
A Theoretical Rationale and Some Empirical
Evidence
Christoph Memmel Atilim Seymen Max Teichert§
Abstract
We investigate German banks' exposure to interest rate risk. In finance, higher de-
mand for a risky asset is typically associated with higher expected return. However,
employing a utility function which implies both risk-averse and risk-seeking behavior
depending on the level of profits, we show that this relationship may get weaker and
even change its sign at low profit levels. For the period 2005-2014, we find not only
the common positive relationship of higher expected returns and rising interest rate
exposure but also that this relationship does become weaker with falling operative
income, its sign eventually changing.

1 Introduction
Banks bear interest rate risk. This risk stems from traditional banking business activity,
in which banks hand out long-term loans and collect short-term deposits. By making
use of hedging instruments, banks can decide how much of this risk they want to retain.
Many banks do not hedge their interest rate risk completely in practice. In Germany, for
example, interest rate risk is one of the most material risks taken by small and medium-
sized banks. The interest rate risk is important from an aggregate perspective too, since,
due to its high correlation in the cross section of banks, it may have a significant impact
on financial stability.1
In finance, one typically observes a positive relationship between the demand for a
risky asset and its expected return. Hence, banks' interest rate risk is generally expected
to decrease if the expected return from bearing the risk falls. Recently, however, a number
of German banks seem to have taken more interest rate risk despite falling expected return.
In this paper, we first show the theoretical possibility that a falling expected return may
induce the taking of a higher interest rate risk. We then estimate empirically the critical
level of bank profitability below which a negative relationship prevails between the taking
of interest rate risk and its expected return. Put differently, in the current paper we
present a theoretical rationale and some empirical evidence for a search for yield in the
form of higher risk-taking due to lower profitability.
In economics, it is well known that there exist situations where increasing prices lead
to an increase in the demand for the respective good. Counter-intuitive though this may
seem, this is not merely a theoretical possibility. There is empirical evidence for the exis-
tence of such a phenomenon, for instance in labor economics: An increase in hourly wages
(which corresponds to an increase in the opportunity cost and thus the price of leisure)
may lead to a decrease in the labor supply and, hence, to an increase in the demand for
leisure (e.g. Camerer, Babcock, Loewenstein, and Thaler (1997)). More recently, Doman-
ski, Shin, and Sushko (2015) find that the demand curve of German insurance companies
for long-term bonds is upward-sloping. In our paper, we also deal with situations where
an increase in the price of a good (here: a decline in the expected return of the risky
asset) may lead to an increase in the demand for this good. Although the ensuing em-
pirical effects are similar to the foregoing labor market example, a different mechanism
is at work in our case: In the labor market example, the income effect dominates the
substitution effect. By contrast, in our paper, the effect of a change in expected profits
on risk-taking is due to the preference structure: Whereas risk is seen as negative and
the decision-makers act in a risk-averse manner in normal times, in times with very low
profits, risk becomes something which is desirable and the decision-makers seek risk.
As mentioned above, interest rate risk can easily be hedged and its amount is hence, to
a large extent, within the discretion of bank managers. Therefore, the observable level of
interest rate risk is a rather accurate reflection of bank managers' underlying incentives.
In this paper, we work with a measure for a bank's exposure to interest rate risk which
is closely linked to the bank's Basel interest rate coefficient, which is the supervisors'
yardstick for the interest rate risk in the banking book. Covering both on- and off-
balance sheet items, this coefficient is a rather comprehensive standardized measure of

interest rate risk concerning banks' traditional business.
The low interest rate environment is a crucial motivation for our investigation. It is
consistently understood as driving down banks' profit margin and, if it persists, as further
reducing banks' income in the future.2 Accordingly, due to low profits, an increasing share
of bank managers can be expected to act as if they were risk-prone. In other words, the
share of banks which increase their interest rate risk exposure even though the term
structure flattens can be expected to rise if the low interest rate environment persists.
Since the interest rate risk applies to a large number of banks simultaneously, financial
stability risks can ensue, among others, also through this channel in the low interest rate
environment. This is a major topical takeaway from our investigation.
We look at German banks' interest rate risk for the period 2005-2014 and find the
usual direct positive relationship between expected returns from term transformation and
exposure to the corresponding interest rate risk. In addition, we show that this relation-
ship becomes weaker if a bank's operative income goes down. Eventually, if the operative
income falls below a certain threshold, the relationship changes its sign, meaning that the
bank starts to increase its exposure to interest rate risk even though the expected returns
from term transformation decrease. We find that, depending on the sample specification
and estimation methodology, about 0.6 to 8.3 per cent of the observations are below this
threshold. This indicates that the prevalence of the search for yield in the sense described
above has been limited until now. However, this may change if the current low interest
rate environment persists.
The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we provide a review of the litera-
ture concerning banks' risk taking and search for yield, especially in a low interest rate
environment. In Section 3, we present an illustrative theoretical model and its empiri-
cal implications. Section 4 describes the data and in Section 5 we discuss the empirical
results. Section 6 concludes.
2 Literature
Our paper is the first to establish a general link between lower expected return from
interest rate risk and increased taking of this risk by banks. We show that there is
a threshold level of profitability below which banks search for yield, i.e. below that
profitability level banks increase their exposure to interest rate risk although the term
structure becomes flatter and thus earning opportunities become smaller.
Research on how interest rates affect banks' risk-taking has gained momentum, not
least due to the low interest environment, in recent years. Most recent contributions
dealing with the subject are framed as investigations of the risk-taking channel of mon-
etary policy as advanced by, e.g., Borio and Zhu (2012). Theoretical research on how a
low interest rate environment affects banks' risk-taking addresses reactions to both lower
short-term rates and lower long-term rates as well as a combination of both. Depending
on the differing reactions of short-term and long-term rates to the low-interest rate en-
vironment, the yield curve may become steeper or flatter, the former (latter) generally
2The European Central Bank (2015) expects that, in the current low interest rate environment, the net
interest margins of banks are going to remain under pressure. See also Borio, Gambacorty, and Hofmann
(2015) and Busch and Memmel (2015) for empirical evidence on decreased bank profitability as a result
of low interest rates and a flat yield curve.

leading to a higher (lower) profitability of the lending business due to term transforma-
tion. Thus, various possible incentives for risk-taking are conceivable in a low interest
environment. Diamond and Rajan (2009) and Acharya and Naqvi (2012), for example,
model how lower short-term rates, or open market operations bringing them about, lead
to higher liquidity in the form of deposits and thus to a lower probability of punishment
in the form of a bank run or a penalty for the manager. Adrian and Shin (2010) ex-
plain how an increase in asset valuesfollowing from lower long-term rates leads to a larger
risk-bearing capacity of financial institutions, provided that the balance sheet is marked
to market and there is a binding value-at-risk constraint. Adrian and Shin (2011) point
out that increased profitability of classic lending business resulting from a steeper yield
curve leads to a larger risk-bearing capacity. Fishburn and Porter (1976), who provide
the classic discussion of the general link between risk and expected return, point to a
what can be called "risk-return slack", i.e. a lower level of risk associated with every given
level of expected return. Banks may be inclined to increase their risk due to a risk-return
slack. In contrast, Rajan (2005) points out how a decreased profitability of classic lending
business, as it results from a flatter yield curve, induces what he calls a search for yield,
whereby higher risks are taken in order to counteract decreasing profits.3
Note that, reversing the arguments presented in the foregoing paragraph, a low interest
environment with a steeper or flatter yield curve can also induce lower risk-taking. How
a low interest environment effects risk-taking hence depends on which of its opposite
effects on risk-taking is dominant. Dell'Ariccia, Laeven, and Marquez (2014) develop,
for example, a model in which a steepening yield curve generates two opposing effects.
While, on the one hand, it leads to higher risk-taking due to a risk-return slack, it lowers,
on the other hand, incentives for risk-taking due to an inverted search for yield through
risk-shifting. In their model, the relative strength of these two channels on risk-taking
depends on the leverage of the bank.
It should also be noted that there are possible second-order effects of a low interest
environment on risk taking as well. Adrian and Shin (2011) model, for example, how low
short-term rates first lead to increased lending, which in turn leads to higher asset valua-
tions and thus to a larger risk-bearing capacity. Bernanke and Gertler (1989, 1990) show
how changes in interest rates reduces the riskiness of borrowers and, if existing borrowers
become less risky, a bank might be induced to accept riskier new borrowers. Finally, there
are possible effects of low interest rates on the risk-taking of an individual bank which
result from the interaction with other banks and the central bank. Most notably, Farhi
and Tirole (2012) identify incentives for banks to correlate their risk exposures in order
to be bailed-out in the event of failure. Such second-order effects are not investigated in
our paper.
Some of the above mentioned mechanisms may affect incentives for both credit risk
and interest rate risk exposure. The model of Dell'Ariccia et al. (2014), for example,
centers on the decision about the monitoring level of a loan portfolio, which is assumed
to be inversely related to the corresponding credit risk, and a steeper yield curve which
3Borio et al. (2015) report evidence for particularly decreased bank profitability as a result of par-
ticularly low interest rates and a particularly flat yield curve. Furthermore, a decreased profitability of
classic lending business may also be due to a smaller margin contribution from deposits as a result of
lower short-term rates as the findings of Ruprecht, Kick, Entrop, and Wilkens (2013) and Busch and
Memmel (2015) suggest.

induces an increased maturity mismatch and hence interest rate risk. Data from lending
surveys and credit registers are analyzed by De Nicolo, Dell'Ariccia, Laeven, and Valencia
(2010), Paligorova and Santos (2013) and Buch, Eickmeier, and Prieto (2014) for the US,
by Maddaloni and Peydró (2011) for the US and the euro area, by Jimenez, Ongena,
and Peydró (2014) for Spain and by Ioannidou, Ongena, and Peydró (2015) for Bolivia.
The common outcome of these studies is that lower short-term rates, which are generally
associated with a steeper yield curve, lead to increased credit risk-taking by banks.
Search for yield is a crucial aspect of our study. In the existing body of literature, two
potential explanations for search for yield have been proposed. The first explanation refers
to some sort of risk-shifting as introduced by Jensen and Meckling (1976), elaborated on
notably by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) and Kane (1989) and observed in a recent case
study by Landier, Sraer, and Thesmar (2011). Explanations of this type maintain the
assumption of perfect rationality and rely on an institutional setup or some appropriate
contractual arrangement such as limited liability or bonus incentive schemes. The second
explanation relies instead on an assumption of bounded rationality. Explanations of
this type feature a behavioural assumption that might be very simple, for example the
inability of market participants to account for all available information as suggested by
Rajan (2005), or they are more sophisticated, say, along the lines of the prospect theory
developed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979).
It should be noted that parts of the existing literature seem to imply a diverse un-
derstanding of what constitutes a search for yield. In particular, some studies diagnose a
search for yield when lower short-term rates lead to increased risk-taking. For example,
when lower short-term rates are accompanied by a steeper yield curve, what might be
called search for yield may occur in the form of increased taking of interest rate risk due
to increased earning opportunities from term transformation. In contrast, we in this pa-
per understand search for yield as a link between lower earning opportunities from taking
a certain risk and increased taking of that risk. Construed in this way, a shift of risk
preferences turns out to be one explanation for search for yield. Our concept as such is
a narrow notion of search for yield which is in line with the reasoning of Rajan (2005)
who defines search for yield as a reaction to lower earning opportunities that consists in
an increase in risk-taking as a means to bolster profitability.
There already exists empirical research on the link between interest rates and the
taking of interest rate risk. Hanson and Stein (2015) find that a steepening of the yield
curve due to a decrease in short-term interest rates induces US banks to increase their
holdings of long-term bonds and thereby to increase their interest rate risk.4 Memmel
(2011), Memmel and Schertler (2013) and Ruprecht et al. (2013) study data from inter-
est rate risk and annual account reporting from Germany with the overall result that a
flatter yield curve, implying a lower expected return from interest rate risk, leads to a
decreased taking of this risk by banks. Our paper refines the findings of these studies by
establishing a general potential link between lower expected return from interest rate risk
and increased taking of this risk. Namely, we start out by showing the existence of the
4Hanson and Stein (2015) actually go even further and show that this increased demand for long-
term bonds leads to an increase in price and by this to a reduction of long-term interest rates also,
though to a smaller extend than the initial decrease in short-term interest rates. Chodorow-Reich (2014)
reports evidence for increased risk taking of money market funds seeking to cover administrative costs in
a low-interest rate environment.

theoretical possibility that below a threshold level of profitability banks search for yield
by increasing their interest rate risk despite, say, a flatter yield curve. Subsequently, we
estimate empirically the level of the threshold and the share of banks falling short of it.
3 Modeling
3.1 Theoretical Model
In our illustrative theoretical model, we include the search for yield in a bank's taking of
interest rate risk by assuming a utility function which is convex below a target rate of
return and concave above this rate. Fishburn and Kochenberger (1979) find that a utility
function of this form best captures the risk attitude of managers. Laughhunn, Payne, and
Crum (1980) present additional evidence for risk-seeking behavior of managers in case of
below target returns.
Note that, by assuming a utility function which is symmetric to the reference point, we
do not accommodate the assumption of loss aversion common in behavioral economics.
This assumption, advanced by Benartzi and Thaler (1995) in the field of behavioural
finance, postulates that more disutility results from a loss of a given size than utility from
a gain of the same size. In contrast, we focus on an expected utility framework with a
symmetric combination of risk seeking below the target rate of return and risk aversion
above it. Such a utility function captures the essence of the search for yield behavior
we are investigating in the most stripped-down way and without loss of generality of our
conclusions. However, it is straightforward to extend our theoretical model to feature loss
aversion.
With the empirical specification derived from the following theoretical model, it is
possible for the first time to identify the critical value of the expected return below which
search for yield dominates the link between expected return from interest rate risk and
taking of this risk by banks. Our empirical findings are the first to document this richer
picture of banks' interest rate risk-taking.
In the following stylized model, we assume that the bank management's utility function
is
u() = arctan() (1)
where the first derivative is
u () =
1
1 + 2
i.e. the marginal utility is always positive. For  > 0, the function is concave, meaning
risk aversion, for  < 0, it is convex which means risk seeking.5
The income  of a bank is assumed to be composed of an on-balance sheet part a
and a part due to derivatives (interest rate swaps) d where the bank can determine its
exposure w:
 = a + w · d (2)
with
5Note that the second derivative of the function reads u () = -2/(1 + 2)2. Pratt (1964) mentions
this utility function, albeit only the positive part where it is concave.
5
d =
µ +  p = 0.5
µ -  1 - p = 0.5
(3)
where p stands for the probability that the first outcome in (3) materializes. We assume
 > µ > 0 so that there are no arbitrage opportunities. Note that, for banks without
derivative usage, d and w can be interpreted as describing what may be called the pure
interest rate risk of on-balance sheet business. Combining (1), (2) and (3), we can express
the expected utility of the bank management as
E(u) = 0.5 · arctan (a + w · (µ + )) + 0.5 · arctan (a + w · (µ - )) . (4)
Differentiating (4) with respect to w, one obtains
dE(u)

= 0.5 ·
(µ + )
1 + (a + w · (µ + ))2
+ 0.5 ·
(µ - )
1 + (a + w · (µ - ))2
. (5)
Setting (5) to zero and solving for w,6 one obtains the optimal exposure wopt
as
wopt = -

µ

µ2

1 + a2

. (6)
The expected income E() when using the optimal weights is always positive (combining
(2) and (6)), irrespective of the on-balance sheet income part a, which can be seen from
Equation (7):
E (opt) = a + wopt
· µ
= a2 + µ2 ·
1 + a2
2 - µ2
> 0. (7)
The rationale behind this result is as follows. Suppose the expected income were negative.
In this case, the probability mass would be mainly in the convex part of the utility
function. Accordingly, the decision-maker would be mainly risk-seeking, not risk-averse,
meaning that he/she derives a higher expected utility from higher risk. Therefore, a
portfolio with negative expected return could not be the optimal one because the decision-
maker could in this case always achieve a higher expected utility by increasing the off-
balance sheet exposure w (which leads to higher risk and higher expected return). For a
sufficiently large derivative exposure w, however, the expected return of the entire bank 
would turn positive (even if the on-balance sheet expected return a is negative) because,
by assumption, the expected return of the derivative is positive. In this case, the usual
trade-off between risk and expected return would apply.
In order to compute the change in the optimal risk exposure in response to changes in
the expected return of the risky asset, we calculate the derivative of the optimal amount

4 Data
As the dependent variable, named w and corresponding to wopt
in the previous section,
we use the year-to-year change in a bank's exposure to interest rate risk in our regressions.
This exposure has to be reported to the supervisor by each bank in Germany, and banks
compute it using their internal risk models. For regulatory purposes, this exposure is
defined as the change in the present value of a bank's banking book due to an overnight
shift of the term structure. The banks perform the calculation twice, once for a parallel
upward shift of 200 basis points and once for a downward shift of the same magnitude,
assuming the (more) adverse of the two outcomes for regulatory purposes. For reasons of
standardization, the present value change is normalized with the banks' regulatory capital
(this measure is then called the Basel interest rate coefficient). In this study, we carry
out the standardization by using the banks' total assets. This standardization is more
convenient for our purposes because the Basel interest rate coefficient includes both the
risk exposure and the risk-bearing capacity, whereas with our standardization, only the
risk exposure is expressed.7 Another deviation from the regulatory figure is that, in our
analysis, we consider only the upward shift in the term structure. We do so because the
conventional business model of banking consists in positive term transformation, which
means that maturities are longer on the asset side than they are on the liability side.
In fact, for 95% of the banks, the upward scenario is the (more) adverse one in our
data set. Our empirical analysis covers the period from 2005 to 2014. For the years
from 2005 to 2010, reports of banks' exposure to interest rate risk are available only
at unsystematic reporting dates, which we treat as follows: Exposures to interest rate
risk with reporting dates from January to June are counted as the year-end value of
the previous year. Accordingly, values with reporting dates from July to December are
counted as year-end values of the current year. From 2011 on, we use the fourth quarter
value as the year-end value. Focusing on the direction of the change in banks' exposure to
interest rate risk and in order to avoid noise due to extreme values (in spite of the outlier
correction mentioned below) in the data, we introduce an alternative dependent variable,

the average Basel interest rate coefficient is about 11 times as large as the average interest rate coefficient

if it has declined or stayed the same. This variable is named I{w>0}.
The main explanatory variables in our regressions are dmu (corresponding to µt
in
Equation (11)), the year-to-year change in the earning opportunities from interest rate
risk, and ert, the deviation of a bank's standardized operating income from its mean
operating income over time. More precisely, dmu measures possible earnings from term
transformation following an investment strategy that consists in revolvingly investing
in 10-year par-yield bonds and of revolvingly issuing par-yield bonds with one year of
maturity.8 ert is defined as the deviation from the mean over time in order to account
for differences in bank-specific business models.9 Furthermore, for the sake of consistency
with the theoretical results of the previous subsection, ert is multiplied by the variable
dmu, yielding the variable ertdmu, which corresponds to the term at,iµt
in Equation
(11).10
In our regressions, we use several control variables. To measure a bank's credit risk, we
look at the write-downs in its credit portfolio and the average riskiness of its assets. The
former variable, labeled writedowns, is defined as the ratio of a bank's gross write-downs
(in a given year) relative to its customer loans. The latter variable, labeled rwa_ta, is
the quotient of a bank's risk-weighted assets and total assets. The bank's risk bearing
capacity is measured by its regulatory capital ratio, its Tier 1 ratio captured by the
variable Tier1. According to theory, an increase in this capital ratio should lead to
higher risk-taking because of the then larger loss-absorbing capacity. To account for time
trends and regulatory changes, the yearly cross-sectional median of the respective variable
is subtracted from the variables writedowns, rwa_ta, and Tier1. Regulatory pressure
is captured by the variable reg, which is a dummy variable equaling one if the Basel
interest rate coefficient (the measure for a bank's interest rate risk used by supervisory
authorities) exceeds 20 per cent, which used to be the regulatory criterion for banks with
elevated interest rate risk exposure.
Table 1 gives the summary statistics of the dependent variable w, i.e. the change
in banks' exposure to interest rate risk standardized with its total assets, the main ex-
planatory variables, dmu and ertdmu, as well as the control variables Tier1, rwa_ta and
writedowns. Summary statistics of the variable ert are provided only to enable a better
understanding of the variable ertdmu. For reasons of confidentiality, we do not report
summary statistics concerning the dummy variable reg.
We apply an outlier correction to all variables where we cut off the values beyond the
first and the 99th percentile as default. The only exception is the continuous variable
dmu for which we abstain from any outlier correction because of limited variation and the
dummy variable reg. Applying an alternative more extensive outlier correction, we treat
the variable ertdmu differently than in the default specification and exclude its values
below the fifth percentile and above the 95th percentile from the sample. Our reason for
reporting results from both of these alternative treatments in our baseline estimations is
8See Memmel (2008) for details on and Memmel (2011) for an application of this investment strategy.
9The main reason to focus on operating income as a measure of profitability is that it is difficult to
manipulate for banks.
10As one of our robustness checks we additionally include ert by itself as an independent variable.
However, the results hardly change and the regression coefficient on ert turns out to be insignificant.

ratio of the 99th percentile to the 90th percentile is 5.3 for ertdmu, whereas it is 2.2 for
the dependent variable w and 1.8 for normally distributed variables.11
During the ten years under consideration (2005-2014), many mergers took place among
the banks in the sample. In our subsection about robustness checks, we try out the
following alternative treatment: Two merging banks cease to exist after the year of the
merger and a new bank is created in the year after the merger. For our baseline results,
however, we proceed as follows: The dominant institution among the two merging banks
continues to exist, whereas the subordinate bank ceases operation.
5 Empirical Results
5.1 Baseline Models
We estimate four baseline specifications of Equation (11), namely with the continuous
(I) or the binary (II) dependent variable and each with the default (a) or the more
extensive (b) outlier correction. The results (see Table 2) show that banks ­ as expected
­ increase their interest rate risk exposure when the return from this risk goes up; i.e. in
all four specifications the regression coefficient on the variable dmu is positive and highly
significant. Focusing on this regression coefficient, the estimates with the continuous
dependent variable (specifications Ia and Ib) show that banks increase their exposure
to interest rate risk (standardized with total assets) by around 0.09 percentage points
on average if the earning opportunities from interest rate risk increase by one standard
deviation, meaning that the Basel interest rate coefficient increases by about 0.7 points
11These numbers for ertdmu and w refer to the sample without any outlier correction applied. The
default outlier correction produces similar numbers, namely 5.0 and 1.8, respectively. This suggests that
the default outlier correction does not take sufficient care of the fat tail of the distribution of ertdmu.
10
(see Footnote 7). Regressing on the binary dependent variable instead (specifications
IIa and IIb), the probability of the average bank increasing its exposure to interest rate
risk in the face of a rise in earning opportunities is estimated to increase by around 5
percentage points.12 This finding is in line with those of Memmel (2011) and Memmel
and Schertler (2013). Note that the positive sign of the regression coefficient on the
variable dmu suggests that banks actively manage their interest rate risk. The reasoning
for this interpretation is as follows. Everything else equal, a flatter yield curve tends to
shift loan demand toward longer maturities or interest rate fixation periods. Hence, if
banks were passive regarding the level of the interest rate risk, a negative relationship
between expected return and interest rate risk would prevail. Accordingly, the positive
relationship which we obtain in our regressions is evidence for banks' active management
of their interest rate risk.
The regression coefficient on the variable ertdmu is significantly positive in all speci-
fications, though on different levels. This means that the interest rate risk exposure of a
bank with a lower deviation of its operative income from its historic mean shows a weaker
response to changes in earning opportunities from interest rate risk (dmu) than a bank
with a higher deviation. If the deviation of a bank's operative income from its historic
mean is very low, i.e. sufficiently negative, the relationship between exposure and earning
opportunities can even change its sign from positive ­ as it is usually the case ­ to nega-
tive. Table 3 gives the level of this critical deviation of operative income a below which
such a reversal of the relationship is to be expected (see Equation (12)). It is striking
that the empirical significance and the economic relevance vary with the outlier correc-
tion applied. With the default outlier correction, the regression coefficient on ertdmu is
significant at the 5% level in the specification with the continuous dependent variable and
the critical deviation of operative income is below the threshold for around 0.6% of the
observations in the sample (specification Ia). Similarly, the specification with the binary
dependent variable produces a critical deviation below which 0.5% of the observations
can be found, though on an inferior level of significance of 10%. With the more extensive
outlier correction, the regression coefficient on ertdmu turns out to be significant at the
1% level for both the specification with the continuous and the specification with the
binary dependent variable, and more than 5% of the observations in the sample display a
deviation of operative income that falls below the critical threshold (specifications Ib and
IIb). This shows that the way in which we treat outliers has a significant impact on the
percentage of observations (and banks) that are below the critical value. Put differently,
with the default outlier correction, an operating income that is close to 1.7 (specification
Ia) or 2.0 (specification IIa) standard deviations below the historic mean takes a bank
below the critical level, and with the more extensive outlier correction, the factor is less
than 0.7 (specification Ib) or 0.6 (specification IIb) standard deviation.
With the default outlier correction, we find that a deviation of the operating income
relative to total assets from its historic mean by -0.80 percentage points (specification Ia)
or -0.98 percentage points (specification IIa) is the threshold. With the more extensive
outlier correction, the threshold is estimated to be at -0.34 percentage points (specification
Ib) or at -0.29 percentage points (specification IIb). Since the mean operating income
12This marginal effect is calculated as the difference between the predicted values of the dependent
variable with all explanatory variables set to their mean value and with all explanatory variables set to
their mean value except for dmu which is set to its mean value plus one standard deviation.

level of operative income is positive. The only exception is the result produced with the
default outlier correction and the binary dependent variable (specification IIa), which,
however, has the lowest level of significance.
Concerning the control variables, we find that regulatory pressure, measured by the
dummy variable reg, has a highly significant impact on the change in the interest rate risk:
If a bank is qualified as an outlier, the bank reduces its exposure by 0.3 percentage points

has a significant positive impacti.e. banks with more capital at hand take a higher interest
rate risk. The riskiness, measured by the variable rwa_ta, is estimated to be significant in
all four specifications. But the sign of the estimated coefficient varies. With the continuous
dependent variable, it is positive (specifications Ia and Ib) and, with the binary dependent
variable, it is negative (specification IIa and IIb). As both the dependent variable and this
explanatory variable are normalized with total assets, the positive sign can be regarded
as an artefact. If total assets decrease, both variables increase mechanically. Noting
that a banks' risk-weighted assets mainly reflect credit risk and not interest rate risk, the
negative coefficient for rwa_ta (as produced by specification IIa and IIb) suggests that
banks have an internal risk budget that they distribute between credit and interest rate

tend to support this assumption. Its effect is significant only in the specifications with the
binary dependent variable (specification IIa and IIb), the estimated sign being negative.
5.2 Robustness Checks
We run several robustness checks. If not otherwise stated, the results are compared to
the ones produced with the baseline specification Ia.
First, we include ert as an additional independent variable in the regression. We do
because the results for the interaction term ertdmu might change, if besides dmu the
second interacted variable ert is seperately included in the regression too. The regression
coefficient on ert turns out to be highly insignificant. The regression coefficient on ertdmu
hardly changes and its level of significance remains if ert is seperately included in the
regression. This suggests that our baseline results for ertdmu do not only pick up some
spurious regression and justifies the exclusion of ert from our baseline models.
Second, we alternatively use the one-year lagged value of the variable ert for the
calculation of the independent variable ertdmu. We do so in order to address a potential
endogeneity problem arising from simultaneity, i.e. a two-way determination of the change
in a bank's exposure to interest rate risk and its operating income. We find that the
regression results hardly differ from the results produced by our baseline model.
Third, we normalize the present value change in a bank's banking book due to an
overnight upward shift in the term structure by 200 basis points using the bank's regu-
latory capital instead of its total assets. As pointed out earlier, this measure is closely
related to the Basel interest rate coefficient. We find that the significance of the variable
ertdmu vanishes under the default outlier correction and becomes a bit weaker given un-
der the more extensive one. The reduction in the significance of the coefficient does not
come as a surprise. As noted above, in our baseline models we apply the normalization
with total assets in order to disentangle changes in risk exposure and in risk-bearing ca-
pacity. The variable included to capture the latter, namely Tier1, becomes insignificant,
if the alternative normalization is applied.
Fourth, we apply a different merger treatment as described in Section 4: No longer
does the dominating bank prevail, but a new bank appears and the two merging banks
13The canonical reference for this finding is the paper by Schrand and Unal (1998).
13
disappear from the sample after a merger. Due to this different treatment of the merg-
ers, we lose some observations. However, the qualitative results remain, although the
significance of the variable ertdmu becomes slightly weaker.
Fifth, we control for bank size. To this end, we include the logarithm of a bank's total
assets normalized by the cross-sectional median for each year as an additional control
variable. The regression coefficient on this variable turns out to be negative and highly
significant. More importantly, the regression coefficients on the main variables of interest
hardly change and their levels of significance remain unaltered.
Sixth, we investigate whether banks applying interest rate derivatives behave differ-
ently. We define a dummy variable which takes the value one in each year if a bank reports
a positive figure for the nominal derivative volume. This is the case in 48.7% of the ob-
servations. We interact this dummy variable with dmu as well as with ertdmu. We find
a positive relationship between expected return and risk for both values of the dummy
variable. As noted above, this highly significant relationship suggests that banks' interest
rate risk is actively managed in both subsamples. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it is
common for smaller banks which do not apply interest rate derivatives to actively manage
their interest rate risk by means of bidirectional loans of different maturities with their
respective central institutions.14'15 However, it is only for banks not using interest rate
derivatives that we find the variable ertdmu to be significant. One possible explanation
for the variable ertdmu to be significant only for these banks is that banks using interest
rate derivatives are likely to use other instruments such as credit default swaps to manage
their risk.16 According to this interpretation, interest rate risk is a viable means of con-
trolling a bank's risk position, although other and possibly more convenient means to that
end exist and it might be the case that only banks with an elaborate risk management
(here proxied by the use of interest rate derivatives) have access to them.17
Seventh, we break up the sample period 2005-2014 into two subperiods, ranging from
2005-2008 and from 2009 on with the low interest rate environment, by interacting the
variables of main interest, dmu and ertdmu, with an appropreately defined dummy vari-
able. We find that the regression coefficients on both variables are significant only for
the first subperiod and insignificant for the second. The lack of significance in the second
subperiod is likely due to relatively little variation of the variable dmu.
Eighth, the empirical specification in Equation (11) is a linearization of the relationship
derived in Equation (9). This relationship is non-linear, which suggests including the
term a2
t,i
µt
in the empirical specification (11). The corresponding coefficient is positive
and significant at the 5% level, suggesting a convex relationship. Note that no real
critical operating income can be calculated with the resulting coefficients. Moreover, the
14Ehrmann and Worms (2004) have a related study on bank networks in Germany.
15Readers who are unfamiliar with the German banking system are referred to the recent overview
provided in chapter 2.1 of Koetter (2013). The three pillars of the German banking system are commercial
banks, savings banks, and cooperative banks. Savings banks and cooperative banks have dedicated central
institutions. Unlike most savings banks and cooperative banks, their central institutions are active on
the capital markets. One of their functions can be described as providing mediated access for savings
banks and cooperative banks to these markets.
16Gündüz, Ongena, Tümer-Alkan, and Yu (2015) find that banks apply CDS as an effective tool to
control bank risk.
17See also Ruprecht et al. (2013), who find that banks with trading book differ from banks without
trading book with respect to their behavior towards interest rate risk.
14
estimated coefficients other than for the quadratic term are all very similar to the ones
that we obtain with the default sample specification.
Nineth, we further restrict the sample to observations with an interest rate risk ex-
posure that occupies a substantial part of the risk-bearing capacity. The underlying
hypothesis is that banks for which this is not the case do not take interest rate risk as a
part of their business model and are, in effect, not subject to the mechanism we inves-
tigate. However, we find that restricting the sample to banks with a net present value
change in the banking book due to an overnight upward shift in the term structure by 200
basis points normalized with regulatory capital of 5% or 10% does not lead to materially
different results. Interestingly, these restrictions reduce the number of observations only
by about 4% or 10%, respectively. This shows that our sample is dominated by banks
with an interest rate risk exposure that occupies a substantial part of the risk-bearing
capacity. This, in turn, explains why restricting the sample in the way described does not
lead to materially different results.
Tenth, for the sake of completeness, we dispense with any outlier correction in our
sample. Compared to the default outlier correction, the regression coefficients in the
estimation with the continuous dependent variable hardly change. The significance of the
coefficient of the variable ertdmu even improves from the 5% to the 1% level.
6 Conclusion
In our theoretical model, we allow for the possibility that, in some situations, the bank
management may change its risk preference from risk aversion to risk seeking. This
behaviour can lead the bank management to increase the bank's risk exposure even if the
expected return from the risk is falling. In our empirical study on the interest rate risk
exposure of banks in Germany, we observe the usual positive direct relationship between
expected return and exposure. Furthermore, we find evidence that in extreme situations,
such as the ones with very low profit levels, the relationship is reversed. The reverse
relationship is relevant for about 0.6% to 8.3% of the observations, depending on the
sample specification and the estimation technique used.
This study is a first attempt to empirically document the search for yield by banks in
a narrow sense. We characterize the extreme situations mentioned above as situations in
which a banks' operative income falls below a certain threshold. If the low interest rate
environment becomes entrenched and banks' earning opportunities are squeezed further,
such extreme situations may become more likely.
