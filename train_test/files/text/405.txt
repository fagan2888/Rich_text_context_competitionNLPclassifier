Over, Under, or About Right: Misperceptions of
Body Weight Among Food Stamp Participants
Michele L. Ver Ploeg1, Hung-Hao Chang2 and Biing-Hwan Lin1
The purpose of this research was to investigate the associations between misperception of body weight and
sociodemographic factors such as food stamp participation status, income, education, and race/ethnicity. National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999­2004 and multivariate logistic regression are
used to estimate how sociodemographic factors are associated with (i) the probability that overweight adults
misperceive themselves as healthy weight; (ii) the probability that healthy-weight adults misperceive themselves
as underweight; and (iii) the probability that healthy-weight adults misperceive themselves as overweight. NHANES
data are representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population. The analysis included 4,362 men and
4,057 women. BMI derived from measured weight and height was used to classify individuals as healthy weight or
overweight. These classifications were compared with self-reported categorical weight status. We find that differences
across sociodemographic characteristics in the propensity to underestimate or overestimate weight status were more
pronounced for women than for men. Overweight female food stamp participants were more likely to underestimate
weight status than income-eligible nonparticipants. Among healthy-weight and overweight women, non-Hispanic
black and Mexican-American women, and women with less education were more likely to underestimate actual weight
status. We found few differences across sociodemographic characteristics for men. Misperceptions of weight are
common among both overweight and healthy-weight individuals and vary across socioeconomic and demographic
groups. The nutrition education component of the Food Stamp Program could increase awareness of healthy body
weight among participants.

Introduction
A sizable portion of overweight Americans do not believe that
they are actually overweight. In 1988­1994, 55% of overweight
or obese men and 23% of overweight or obese women did not
believe they were overweight (1). Such misperceptions have
been noted as potential barriers to addressing weight control
problems--it is unlikely that someone will address a problem if
they do not consider it to be a problem. Misperceptions about
body weight also provide behavioral clues about why some
groups may be more prone to obesity (1,2­4). For example,
misperceptions about overweight status (an overweight 
person
who incorrectly believes he or she is a healthy weight) among
some subgroups may simply reflect a higher prevalence of
overweight among those subgroups, such that people do not
perceive themselves as heavier than their peers because their
peers are heavier too. Or tendencies among subgroups to per-
ceive weight status incorrectly may reflect ideals of body weight
among subgroups (5).
One subgroup of particular concern is those who participate
in the Food Stamp Program. This program, which is run by the
US Department of Agriculture, issues monthly benefits for gro-
cery store purchases for households with low incomes (below
130% of Federal poverty guidelines) (6). Higher prevalence of
overweight and obesity among some individuals who receive
food stamps, particularly women (7), has led to suggestions
that the program may need to do more to address the problem
of obesity while ensuring adequate nutrition for low-income
households (8). How food stamp participants perceive their
body weight is important for two reasons. First, if participants
are less likely to recognize that they are overweight, they may be
less likely to adapt behavior to maintain a healthy body weight
or reduce weight, and may become heavier than nonpartici-
pants. Second, the Food Stamp Program includes a nutrition
education component. This component of the program could
also be used to inform participants about what is considered a
healthy weight and potentially help correct misperceptions.
Previous studies of which subgroups are prone to misper-
ceptions about their weight found differences across race/eth-
nicity, gender, and some education and income groups (2,3).

Additionally, cross-tabulations show that overweight food
stamp participants are more likely to perceive themselves as
healthy weight than nonparticipants (1). However, these cross-
tabulations do not control for other factors that are associated
with food stamp participation although they are also associ-
ated with weight misperception--particularly race/ethnicity,
income, and education.
In this article, we explored the determinants of mispercep-
tions of weight status. We expanded upon previous work in
several ways. First, we considered whether one particular sub-
group of public policy interest--participants in the US Food
Stamp Program--are more prone to misperceptions about
weight status. Unlike previous work examining weight percep-
tion among food stamp participants, we used a multivariate
framework and controlled for factors associated with weight
misperception. Second, we used recent data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­
2004 to analyze the relationship between food stamp partici-
pation, other economic and demographic variables, and the
accuracy of weight perception. This includes weight percep-
tion among the overweight and among those who are healthy
weight, unlike previous studies that focused on only one of
these two groups (2). Finally, we included an individual's mea-
sured BMI (kg/m2) as a covariate to ensure that our results do
not simply reflect differences in average BMI across population
subgroups. This variable is important because individuals with
BMI closer to the cutoff values for each weight status category
may be more likely to assess their weight status incorrectly.
Studies of body weight misperception for the general popula-
tion did not include this measure, although a study of severely
obese women did and found BMI was not correlated with

misperception of body weight (9). Our study tested this vari-
able for the general population, for whom weight status may be
more ambiguous compared with the severely obese.
Methods and Procedures
The NHANES uses a stratified, multistage probability sampling design
and is representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized popula-
tion (10). We used data from the 1999­2004 surveys in this article.
Weight and height for each survey respondent were measured by
trained medical staff in the NHANES Mobile Examination Centers.
BMI was calculated to classify each individual as either underweight,
healthy-weight, or overweight (for adults, BMI < 18.5 is underweight;
18.5  BMI < 25 is healthy weight; and BMI  25 is overweight).
A small percentage of adults are underweight (<2%). Because this is
such a small percentage of the population and because members of
this group who perceive themselves as overweight are probably much
different than normal-weight individuals who perceive themselves as
overweight, we excluded them from the study. Respondents were also
asked whether they consider themselves "overweight, underweight,
or about the right weight". Responses to this question were compared
with an individual's measured weight category (healthy weight or
overweight). For overweight adults, we examined determinants of
whether an individual underestimated his/her weight (reports weight
statusaseither"abouttherightweight"or"underweight").Forhealthy-
weight adults, we examined determinants of whether an individual
underestimated his/her actual weight (reports being underweight),
and whether an individual overestimated his/her measured weight
(reports being overweight). Misperceptions of body weight among
both those who are healthy weight and overweight are 
important.
Understanding what factors are associated with 
misperception among
the overweight can help explain why people are overweight. Similarly,
understanding misperception among those who are healthy weight
but believe they are underweight or overweight can be used to under-
stand why some have not yet become overweight (they already believe
they are and may take action to lose weight) or about whether they
may become overweight (they believe they are underweight and do
not change behavior to remain at a healthy weight). Studying both
populations also allows comparisons of whether the factors associ-
ated with underestimating weight are the same for overweight and
healthy-weight individuals.
Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of overesti-
mating or underestimating weight status. For overweight individuals, the
probability of underestimating weight status was estimated. For healthy-
weightindividuals,twoseparatelogisticmodels--theprobabilityofunder-
estimating weight status and the probability of overestimating weight
status--were estimated. Odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95%
confidence intervals for each covariate were reported for each model. Sta-
tistical analyses were conducted using SUDAAN
(version 9.0.1; Research
Triangle Park, NC) (11). Following the literature on modeling BMI, mod-
els were estimated separately for men and for women (12­14).
We examined whether weight misperception differs by Food Stamp
Program participation and by household income. To receive food
stamps, gross household income cannot exceed 130% of the Federal
poverty guidelines. Consequently, we combined food stamp partici-
pation and income into four subgroups--food stamp participants,
income-eligible nonparticipants (income below 130% of the poverty
guidelines), 
moderate-income individuals (income between 130 and
300% of the poverty guidelines), and high-income individuals (income
exceeds 300% poverty guidelines). Food stamp participation was meas-
ured by responses to the question "Are you now authorized to receive
Food Stamps?"
Other covariates in the logistic models were race/ethnicity, (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, or other race),
age, self-reported current smoking status, education level (less than high
school, high school graduate, and some postsecondary schooling), and
marital status (married or single). We also included each individual's
BMI as a covariate. Individuals with BMI closer to the cutoff values for
weight status designation may be more likely to assess their weight status
incorrectly. For example, we expected that individuals with a BMI of
26 are more likely to perceive themselves as healthy weight incorrectly
compared with individuals with a BMI of 30. To control for this, we
included a measure of the difference between measured BMI and the
lower end of the BMI cutoff point for each weight status. For healthy-
weight individuals, this variable is the difference between the individual's
measured BMI and the lower cutoff for healthy weight (BMI = 18.5).
For overweight individuals, this variable is the difference between an
individual's measured BMI and the lower cutoff for overweight status
(BMI = 25). This is an important improvement over the methods used
in previous studies, which did not control for measured BMI. If among
overweight women, non-Hispanic black women are much heavier than
non-Hispanic white women (such that they have greater average BMI,
say 30 vs. 27), we expect that more non-Hispanic white women would
incorrectly assume they are healthy weight simply because more of them
are near the cutoff for overweight relative to black women. Without
controlling for BMI, it may appear that variation in the propensity to
overestimate or underestimate weight status is driven by race or other
covariates when in reality, variation is really driven by differences in
average BMI levels.
Because only respondents over the age of 16 were asked about their
weight status and because the BMI classifications for children under
the age of 20 are different from adults, our analysis only examined mis-
perception in weight among adults aged 20. We excluded pregnant or
breast-feeding women. After deleting observations with missing values,
the final sample included 4,362 male and 4,057 female respondents.

separately by gender.

Results
Table 1 shows the percentage of men and women who cor-
rectly or incorrectly assessed their body weight status. Among
healthy-weight women, 32.4% reported being overweight, but
only 4.0% reported being underweight. For healthy-weight
men, 18.4% reported being overweight, 73.8% correctly per-
ceived their own weight status, but 7.9% reported being under-
weight. Approximately one-third of overweight men (32.9%)
underestimated their body weight (reported being under-
weight or about the right weight). Among overweight women,
only 12.7% characterized themselves as underweight or about
the right weight.
Age, education, food stamp participation, income, and
racial/ethnic background distinguished women in their per-
ception of body weight status. However, few of these variables
helped explain variations in men's perception. Covariates that
were statistically significant at the 95% probability level are
discussed here. Full results for all covariates are reported in
Tables 2 and 3.
Overweight adults who think they are healthy weight
Food stamp participation and income were associated with fail-
ure to recognize overweight status among overweight women
(Figure 1). Overweight women who received food stamp
benefits (the reference group) were more likely to state they
were healthy weight compared with overweight women who
were income eligible but did not receive food stamp benefits
(OR = 0.55). Further, the ORs for moderate- and high-income

were slightly more likely to misperceive their body weight sta-
tus, compared with younger women--that is, the BMI thresh-
old for what is perceived to be overweight rose with age. Failure
to recognize overweight did not differ by smoking behavior or
by martial status among overweight adults.
Healthy-weight adults who think they are underweight
None of the covariates except for BMI explained variations
in the probability that healthy-weight men misperceived
their weight as "underweight", so we focused our attention on
healthy-weight women. Here we found that racial and ethnic
differences in the propensity to underestimate weight status also
existed. Non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American women
were more likely (ORs are 3.81 and 3.96, respectively) to per-
ceive themselves as underweight even though they were healthy
weight, compared with non-Hispanic white women (Table 3).
Age had an OR of 1.04, suggesting that older healthy-weight
women were slightly more likely to state they were under-
weight than younger healthy-weight women. Relative to non-
smokers, healthy-weight women who smoke were more than
two times as likely to believe they were underweight than
nonsmokers (OR = 2.41). Women with high school diplo-
mas were less likely to state they were underweight relative
to those with less than a high school education, but there
were no significant differences between those with less than a
high school education and women with some postsecondary
education. Food stamp participation was not associated with
the likelihood that healthy-weight women underestimate
weight status.
overweight women were 0.41 and 0.24, respectively, suggest-
ing that recognition of overweight status rose with income.
Among overweight men, body weight misperception did not
vary by food stamp participation or income (Table 2).
Among overweight women, non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans were less likely to recognize they were
overweight compared with non-Hispanic whites (ORs are 3.88
and 2.24, respectively) (Figure 2). The findings, consistent
with previous studies (2­5,9), suggest that non-Hispanic black
women and Mexican-American women perceived a higher
BMI cutoff for "overweight," compared with the BMI non-
Hispanic white women perceived as "overweight". Similarly,
non-Hispanic black men appeared to have a heavier thresh-
old for "overweight" status relative to non-Hispanic white men
(Figure 2). Non-Hispanic black men were more than three
times as likely relative to white men to fail to recognize they
were overweight (OR = 3.11).
Among overweight men and women, those with postsec-
ondary education were less likely to perceive themselves as
healthy weight compared with those who did not finish high
school (OR = 0.63 for men and 0.53 for women, respectively).
Overweight women with high school diplomas were also less
likely to incorrectly believe they were healthy weight (OR =
0.56), compared with overweight women who do not have
a high school diploma. For men, there was no difference in
misperception of overweight status between those with a high
school diploma and those without.
Body weight misperception also varied by age among over-
weight women, but not among overweight men. Older women

analysts are worried that food stamp benefits may actually cause
obesity among participants as among some subgroups, food
stamp participants have higher rates of obesity than nonpartici-
pants (8). Studies that have attempted to link food stamp par-
ticipation with weight gain have found no relationship or a very
weak relationship between food stamp participation and weight
for men and children, but for women, participation in the pro-
gram seems to increase BMI and the probability of obesity
slightly (15­18). Our results indicate that misperception about
body weight was a potential barrier to achieving healthy weight
among overweight women who received food stamp benefits,
but not among men. It is unclear why female food stamp par-
ticipants were more likely to misperceive their weight relative to
nonparticipants. It could be the result of a "peer effect" if food
stamp participants had social connections with other partici-
pants. It may also be that those who have accepted, ignored, or
were oblivious to any stigma attached to receiving government
assistance like food stamps were also less worried about stigma
that may be attached to being overweight. Regardless, the
higher rates of misperception among food stamp participants
may be part of the reason why women who receive food stamps
are more likely to be obese.
Food stamp nutrition education (FSNE) is a component
of the program that includes provisions for states to provide
nutrition education programs to participants, and almost all
state agencies implement FSNE programs. FSNE programs
are intended to help participants make healthier choices with
respect to food purchases, including choices to help combat
obesity. Our results indicate that FSNE programs may provide
a useful service to participants by helping them recognize what
body weight is considered healthy or unhealthy. Such an inter-
vention might include information on calculating and inter-
preting BMI and on the health risks of overweight. The efficacy
of such an intervention would need to be evaluated. If success-
ful, increased attention to BMI and healthy weight may help
food stamp participants prevent weight gain or reduce weight.
BMI has been shown to vary by social and demographic
factors, including income, race and ethnicity, gender, and age
(19). For example, among overweight women in the 1999­2004
NHANES, the average BMI for non-Hispanic blacks and non-
Hispanic whites were 33.9 and 32.1, respectively. A strong and
consistent finding of our study is that the higher an individual's
BMI, the lower the probability of misperceiving overweight as
healthy weight. BMI is also correlated with the probability of
overestimating and underestimating weight among those who
are healthy weight. By including an individual's BMI (devia-
tion from the cutoffs) in the model, we are able to improve the
explanatory power of our estimates of the propensity to under-
estimate or overestimate weight status by social and demo-
graphic factors. Our results confirm that even after controlling
for BMI, non-Hispanic black women and Mexican-American
women are more likely to underestimate their weight status
compared with non-Hispanic white women. In other words,
non-Hispanic black women and Mexican-American women
are more likely to misperceive overweight as healthy weight
and to misperceive healthy weight as underweight.
Healthy-weight adults who think they are overweight
Racialandethnicdifferenceswerealsonoticeableamongwomen
who were healthy weight but believed they were overweight
(Figure 3). The ORs were 0.26, 0.58, and 0.54 for non-Hispanic
blacks, Mexican Americans, and other race, respectively, sug-
gesting that non-Hispanic white women were more likely
to believe they were overweight than women of other racial/
ethnic groups. The OR for age was 0.97, suggesting that older
women were less likely to perceive themselves as overweight
than younger women. Women with at least some postsecond-
ary schooling were more likely to perceive they were overweight
relative to those with less than a high school education (1.69
times more likely), but there was no difference between high
school graduates and those with less than a high school educa-
tion. Food stamp participation, income, and 
marital status did
not explain variations in misperceiving healthy weight as over-
weight among healthy-weight women (Table 3).
Among healthy-weight men, non-Hispanic black men were
much less likely to believe they were overweight relative to
non-Hispanic white men (OR = 0.13), indicating that healthy-
weight black men had a heavier threshold for overweight status
than healthy-weight white men. Among healthy-weight men,
those with higher BMI were more likely to perceive themselves
as overweight. None of the other social and demographic
variables helped explain variations in men's misperception of
healthy weight as overweight.
Discussion
Previous work had shown that the determinants of adults' BMI
differ by gender (12­14). Our study further suggests that mis-
perception of body weight status also varied by gender among
both healthy-weight and overweight adults. The findings sup-
port the approach to estimate separate models for men and
women instead of a pooled model.
We found that overweight women who received food stamp
benefits were less likely to recognize they were overweight
than eligible nonparticipants and that these differences existed

The consistency of these racial/ethnic results across healthy
weight and overweight status suggest that misperception of
body weight does have a social or cultural component. For
example, weight misperception could be a result of a "peer"
effect--women base their weight status perceptions on the
weights of their peers. It could also be evident that groups
attach different values to a particular weight status. White
women indicate they feel more pressure to be thin, are more
likely to diet, and have smaller ideal body sizes than black
women (5,20,21). With smaller ideal body weight and more
dieting behavior, white women may feel more pressure to be
thinner and thus more likely to report being overweight than
black women, who do not have the same thinner body weight
ideals.
Like race and ethnicity, age is also a consistent predictor of
misperception of weight among women. These results could
also suggest that peer effects may be related to misperception of
body weight, if women tend to form peer groups with women
near the same age as them. But further research is needed.
Such research should consider how proximate peers (both in
terms of similar socioeconomic status and demographics and
in terms of actual social and neighborhood proximity) affect
misperception of weight status, similar to how obesity has
recently been linked among peers (22). For example, are over-
weight adults who live with or near many other overweight
adults more likely to underestimate their weight? Research
on how connections across and within races, socioeconomic
status, or other demographic characteristics affect perception
of body weight may also be constructive. For example, does
weight misperception for an individual of one race with many
connections to individuals of other races or ethnicities differ
from those of someone who is the same race but has fewer
cross-race connections? Further research could consider these
questions.
