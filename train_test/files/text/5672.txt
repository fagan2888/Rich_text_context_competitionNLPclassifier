Abstract
Objective: To investigate the value of spectral computed tomography (CT) dual-substance
separation technology for diagnosing left ventricular (LV) thrombus.
Methods: In this observational case­control study, spectral CT scans were conducted in patients
with and without LV thrombi. Densities in the regions of the LV cavity, papillary muscles and LV
thrombus were observed on 140kVp mixed-energy and 70 keV single-energy images. Iodine and
blood were chosen as the base material pair, the densities were observed and the iodine and blood
concentrations were quantitatively measured.
Results: A total of 24 patients were enrolled in this study. On iodine-based density images, both the
LV thrombus and papillary muscles showed low-attenuation shadows. On blood-based density
images, comparable high-density attenuation was found in the LV thrombus and LV cavity, while
relative hypodensity was noted in the papillary muscles. Iodine and blood densities were significantly
lower in papillary muscles than in the LV cavity. Iodine densities were significantly lower in the LV
thrombus than the LV cavity, whereas blood densities in the two areas did not differ significantly.
Conclusions: Spectral CT dual-substance separation technology and its derived images of iodine-
and blood- based densities provide a new, simple, and feasible semiquantitative method to detect
LV thrombus that warrants further investigation.

Introduction
Left ventricular (LV) thrombosis is often
accompanied by peripheral vascular
thromboembolic complications such as
ischaemic stroke, thus has a high morbidity
and mortality.1­3 Timely and effective antic-
oagulative/antithrombotic therapy could
reduce (or even completely dissolve) the
thrombi. Therefore, the accurate detection
of the LV thrombus is essential for clinicians
to determine treatment strategies and to
improve the patient's prognosis. Currently,
two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiog-
raphy (TTE) is the most commonly used
technique for detecting LV thrombi.4,5
It provides information such as shape, size
and anatomical site of the thrombus, but
occasionally trabecular muscles, false chor-
dae tendineae and papillary muscle tumours
may be misdiagnosed as thrombi. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has been vali-
dated as a fairly accurate modality to diag-
nose LV thrombi.6,7 However, it is not
suitable for all patients due to increased
contraindications, higher cost and slower
imaging speed compared with TTE. Spectral
computed tomography (CT) imaging, a
newly developed technology, has been
applied in areas such as coronary artery
imaging,8 plaque recognition9,10 and myo-
cardial perfusion,11 but no data have been
reported on its application in the identifica-
tion of LV thrombi.
The aim of this study was to investigate
the use of a gemstone spectral imaging (GSI)
CT scanner to identify LV thrombi using
CT spectra based on their unique dual-
substance separation technology and
derived single substance isolated images.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients who underwent coronary CT angi-
ography in the Division of Cardiology,
China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin
University, Changchun, Jilin Province,
China between December 2013 and March
2014 were enrolled sequentially into this
observational case­control study. All patients
underwent a TTE examination within 3 days
prior to CT examination. On the basis of the
TTE results, patients were divided into two
groups: group 1 consisted of patients who had
no cardiac thrombus; group 2 consisted of
patients with LV thrombus detected by TTE,
and the diagnosis was further confirmed with
sequential TTE follow-ups with regular
antithrombotic therapy using warfarin.
Patients in groups 1 and 2 were age and sex
matched. Ethical approval was obtained from
the Ethics Committee of the China-Japan
Union Hospital of Jilin University (No.
20140338). Written informed consent was
obtained from the patients prior to their
inclusion in the study.
TTE examination
Two-dimensional TTE examinations were
performed using a Philips SonosÕ 5500
colour Doppler ultrasound system (Philips
Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) and
standard techniques, in accordance with
the guidelines of the American Society of
Echocardiography.12 LV thrombus was
defined as an echodense mass within the
LV cavity with margins distinct from the LV
wall, visible in both systole and diastole in at
least two views, with a morphology that was
different from tissues such as papillary
muscles, chordae tendineae, trabecular mus-
cles or technical artefacts. TTE results were
reviewed by two experienced ultrasonog-
raphy examiners.
Spectral CT scan
A Discovery CT750 HD scanning system
(GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was
used in the GSI mode. All patients signed an
additional informed consent form prior
to undergoing their CT angiography exam-
ination. The patient's heart rate was
Zeng et al. 55
controlled at <70 beats/min, and each
patient lay in a supine position, connected
to an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a bin-
ocular high-pressure injector. The position-
ing line was set at 1­2 cm below the trachea
carina to cardiac diaphragm surface.
Contrast agent application was controlled
by the bolus tracking technique. A total of
20 ml nonionic iodinated contrast media
iohexl (OmnipaqueTM 350 mg/ml; GE
Healthcare) was injected via the cubital
vein with a velocity of 5 ml/s, followed by
15 ml saline injected at the same velocity. A
region of interest (ROI) was placed into the
aortic root, and image acquisition began 6 s
after the density level reached the predefined
threshold of 100 Hounsfield units. The
patient was then instructed to hold his/her
breath, and a further 70­80 ml of contrast
media was infused intravenously at the same
velocity followed by 30­40 ml of saline.
Scanning parameters were as follows: X-
radiography tube helical scan speed, 0.6 s/
cycle; pitch, 0.969; detector width, 4 cm;
instantaneous voltage switch (0.5 ms)
between high and low energy (140 kVp and
80 kVp); and tube current, 600 mA. Two
modes were selected for image reconstruc-
tion: the first set of images was reconstructed
using 140 kVp mixed energy; the second set
of images was constructed using 70 keV
single energy. The reconstructed slice thick-
ness and slice spacing was 2.50 mm.
Image analysis and measurement
Image analysis and measurement in group 1
patients. Reconstructed images using
140 kVp mixed energy and 70 keV single
energy were transferred to a GE Advantage
Workstation 4.6 (GE Healthcare). Image
densities in the regions of the normal LV
cavity and papillary muscles were visually
observed. In the GSI viewer software, iodine
and blood were chosen as the base material
pair. Then, in the generated isolated images
of iodine- and blood-based density, the
densities in the regions of the normal LV
cavity and papillary muscles were simultan-
eously compared with visual observations.
Subsequently, a scanning slice showing the
clearest images and maximum papillary
muscles was selected, and a ROI with a
size of 3 mm Â 3 mm was set in the regions of
the papillary muscles and within the normal
LV cavity for the same slice, respectively.
Iodine and blood densities at these ROIs
were qualitatively measured, based on the
respective isolated images of iodine- and
blood-based density. Five ROIs were set for
each slice in the LV cavity and papillary
muscles, respectively, and the measurements
were repeated in three different slices. The
mean results were used for statistical
analysis.
Image analysis and measurement in group 2
patients. Using the aforementioned method
for patients without thrombi, densities were
observed in the normal LV cavities and
thrombi on the mixed-energy 140 kVp and
single-energy 70 keV images. The identifica-
tion of an LV thrombus was made by two
attending radiologists (M.C.Z. and L.L.)
with reference to the TTE images.
Simultaneous comparative observations of
densities in the regions of the LV cavity and
thrombus on the isolated images of iodine-
and blood-based density were made; the
mean iodine and blood densities in the
regions of the normal LV cavity and
thrombi were qualitatively measured.
According to the obtained observations
and analysis results, retrospective analyses,
slice by slice, were undertaken of the isolated
images of the iodine- and blood-based dens-
ity in the patients with LV thrombus. On the
basis of the different manifestations of LV
papillary muscles and thrombus on spectral
CT, normal papillary muscles and LV
thrombotic lesions were identified when
they coexisted at the same scanning slice.
Cardiac MRI scans (MAGNETOMÕ
Skyra 3.0 T scanner; Siemens Healthcare,
56 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)
Erlangen, Germany) were conducted in
patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic
syndromes associated with LV thrombi.
Cine MRI was performed with breath
holding, retrospective ECG-gating and true
fast imaging with steady-state precession
sequence.
All patients diagnosed with an LV throm-
bus received 40 mg (equivalent of 4000 IU
anti-Xa activity) of low-molecular weight
heparin sodium (ClexaneÕ; Aventis
Intercontinental, Antony, France) subcuta-
neously twice daily and 2.5­5.0 mg of
warfarin (Xiinyi Jiufu Pharmaceutical Co.,
Shanghai, China) orally once daily for 3­5
days. Following discharge from hospital,
patients continued to receive 2.5­9.0 mg of
warfarin orally once daily for at least 1
month; the dose of warfarin was adjusted
according to an INR of 2.0­3.0. TTE
was rechecked at 1 month after initial
treatment.
Statistical analyses
SigmaSTATÕ 3.5 software (Systat Software,
San Jose, CA, USA) was used for statistical
analyses. Data were expressed as mean Æ SD
for continuous variables with normal distri-
bution. Data were expressed as median
(25th­75th percentile) for continuous vari-
ables without a normal distribution.
Student's t-tests were performed in order
to compare continuous variables with
normal distribution. The paired-sample
t-test was used to compare blood and
iodine densities between the LV cavity
and thrombus and between the LV cavity
and papillary muscles for the same slice. An
independent-samples t-test was used to com-
pare differences in the blood and iodine
densities of the LV thrombus and papillary
muscles between the two groups.
Nonparametric Mann­Whitney U-test was
used to compare samples with a not-normal
distribution. A P-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
Twenty-four patients who underwent cor-
onary CT angiography, including 16 male
and eight female patients (age range, 26­79
years; mean Æ SD age, 56.3 Æ 16.5 years),
were enrolled in the study. On the basis of
the TTE results, patients were divided into
two groups. Group 1 consisted of 12 patients
who had no cardiac thrombus (eight male
and four female; age range 30­78 years;
mean age Æ SD, 56.4 Æ 15.9 years), including
two patients with acute myocardial infarc-
tion (AMI) within 2 weeks of onset, four
patients with chronic myocardial infarction
(>3 month onset of AMI), four patients
with dilated cardiomyopathy and two
patients with atrial fibrillation before radio-
frequency ablation. Group 2 consisted of 12
patients (eight male and four female; age
range 26­79 years; mean age Æ SD,
56.1 Æ 17.7 years) with LV thrombus
detected by TTE. The diagnosis was further
confirmed with sequential TTE follow-ups
with regular antithrombotic therapy using
warfarin. Two patients had AMI within 2
weeks of onset, four patients had chronic
myocardial infarction, four patients had
dilatated cardiomyopathy and two patients
had idiopathic hypereosinophilic syn-
dromes. A single thrombus was detected in
nine patients and two or more thrombi
in three patients, on TTE. Thrombi varied
in size among patients with the maximum
being 41.2 mm Â 27.8 mm and the minimum
being 10.5 mm Â 7.4 mm on TTE. Two
patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic
syndromes underwent cardiac MRI
examination.
In group 1 patients on iodine-based
density images, the LV cavity with normal
filling of contrast agent manifested as a high-
density attenuation, while papillary muscles
appeared as low-density attenuation or
filling defects (Figure 1A). On the blood-
based density images, the density of the
papillary muscles was relatively lower
compared with the LV cavity with visual
Zeng et al. 57
observations (Figure 1B). Quantitative
iodine and blood concentrations in the
papillary muscles were significantly lower
than those in the LV cavities (P < 0.001;
Table 1).
In group 2 patients on iodine-based
density images, the LV cavity with normal
filling of contrast agent manifested as high-
density attenuation, while the LV thrombus
appeared as low-density attenuation or

filling defects (Figure 2A). On the blood-
based density images, density in the LV
thrombotic region was relatively high and
comparable with the normal LV cavity with
visual observations (Figure 2B). The mean
iodine concentration in the LV thrombus was
significantly lower than that in the normal
LV cavity (P < 0.001), while no difference
was found in the mean blood concentrations
between these areas (Table 1).
In the 12 patients without cardiac throm-
bus in group 1, the mean iodine and blood
densities in papillary muscles were sub-
tracted from those in the LV cavity at the
same slice, to obtain the iodine and blood
density differences between papillary mus-
cles and the LV cavity for each slice. This
process was repeated in three different
scanning slices, and the mean value was
used for each patient's final iodine and
blood density differences between papillary
muscles and the LV cavity. Using the same
method, iodine and blood density differ-
ences were obtained between the LV throm-
bus and LV cavity in the 12 patients with LV
thrombus in group 2. Statistical analyses
showed that the iodine density difference in
the LV thrombus was similar to that in
papillary muscles, while the blood density
difference was significant between these two
areas (P < 0.001; Table 1).
On the basis of the results described
above, slice by slice, the isolated iodine-
and blood-density images were simultan-
eously analysed in patients with LV
thrombus in group 2. For each patient, it
was possible to easily and clearly identify LV
thrombotic lesions from normal papillary
muscles. Figure 3 illustrates the CT spec-
trum images for a patient who had mixed
papillary muscles and LV thrombus in the
same slice. On the iodine-based density
image, both papillary muscles and LV
thrombus presented with less filling of con-
trast agent. On the blood-based density
image, the papillary muscles showed a rela-
tively lower density, while the LV thrombus
showed a density similar to the LV cavity.
Therefore, the differentiation between the
papillary muscles and the LV thrombotic
lesion could be made by the simultaneous
observation of the images of the iodine and
blood densities in the same slice. The
measured iodine and blood concentrations
confirmed the visual observation results
(Figure 3).
In this study, two patients with LV
thrombus underwent cardiac MRI scans.
The single cine MRI images showed low-
density signals in the regions of the LV
thrombus for both patients (Figure 4). All
patients in group 2 received low-molecular

Discussion
Left ventricular thrombosis is common in
patients with AMI, ventricular aneurysm13
and dilated cardiomyopathy.1 Occasionally,
LV thrombus can be found in patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypereo-
sinophilia.14,15 It is often accompanied by
peripheral vascular thromboembolic com-
plications such as stroke, and thus has a high
mortality and morbidity.2­3,13 LV thrombi
may be significantly reduced or even
completely dissolved if timely and effective
anticoagulant and/or antithrombotic ther-
apy is administered.16 Therefore, timely and
accurate detection of LV thrombi is essential
in order to develop treatment strategies and
improve the patient's prognosis.
Currently, TTE has been proposed as the
most commonly used standard modality for
detecting LV thrombi.4,5 However, a large
variation exists in the results obtained by
different operators, and up to 46% of
cardiac thrombi diagnosed with TTE are
uncertain.4,5 Occasionally, structures such
as trabecular muscles, false chordae tendi-
nae and papillary muscle tumours may be
misdiagnosed as LV thrombi.6 Cardiac MRI
has been validated as a fairly accurate
modality to detect cardiac thrombi,6,7 but
due to its higher cost, more contraindica-
tions, lower imaging speed and longer exam-
ination time compared with TTE, it is not
appropriate for all patients. Multislice
spiral CT (MSCT) angiography is a widely
accepted method for the evaluation of cor-
onary arteries. While clearly revealing the
three-dimensional coronary arteries, MSCT
is capable of showing the low-density sha-
dows or filling defects caused by thrombotic
lesions. However, conventional nonspectral
MSCT cannot be used to make a qualitative
diagnosis based on tissue composition or
accurately identify thrombotic lesions from
normal papillary muscles. This is because
papillary muscles are also manifest as low-
density shadows on routine CT images.
The present study showed that spectral
CT dual-substance separation technology
using a GSI scanner and its derived iodine-
and blood-based density images allow the
simple and clear identification of LV
thrombi. To our knowledge, this is the first
report to describe the use of this new spectral
CT imaging technique for this purpose.
Compared with conventional MSCT,
spectral CT imaging is a newly developed
technology.17 It utilizes a single X-radio-
graphy tube and an instantaneous switching
between high and low voltage of 80 kVp and
140 kVp within 0.5 ms to obtain two sets of
X-radiography sampling data almost simul-
taneously, for the same layer and in the same
direction. In addition to generating 101
single-energy images,18 it can decompose
the attenuation coefficient of one substance
into a weighted sum of any other two
substances (base material pair), thereby
achieving composition analysis and sub-
stance separation.19
Using spectral CT dual-substance separ-
ation technology and selecting blood and
iodine as the base material pair, the isolated
images of iodine (blood)-based and blood
(iodine)-based density were obtained. On
iodine-based density images, both normal
papillary muscles and LV thrombi appeared
as low-density shadows, which represented a
reduced filling by contrast medium. On
blood-based density images, densities and
measured blood concentrations in LV
thrombi were similar to the normal LV
cavity, while lower densities and quantita-
tive blood concentrations were noted in
papillary muscles. Thus, by simultaneously
comparing the blood- and iodine-based
images for the same slice, LV thrombotic
lesions could be easily differentiated from
normal papillary muscles. This spectral CT
Zeng et al. 63
capability cannot be achieved with the trad-
itional MSCT method.
Normal papillary muscles and LV
thrombi have different manifestations on
isolated blood- and iodine-based density
images, which may be closely related to
their different material composition and
blood supply characteristics. Iodine is the
main component of CT-enhanced contrast
agent, and the iodine-based density images
show the contrast agent (iodine) distribu-
tion, therefore reflecting the tissue's blood
supply.20 It is more difficult for the contrast
agent (iodine) to reach the regions of the
papillary muscles and LV thrombus, com-
pared with the normal LV cavity. Thus,
these areas exhibited a lower iodine density
compared with the LV cavity on the isolated
iodine-based density images. In contrast,
since the LV thrombus is a condensed
mass with blood components coagulated
within the LV cavity, its composition is
similar to the blood components in the LV
cavity (both contain platelets and erythro-
cytes). Therefore, the observed densities and
the measured blood concentrations are simi-
lar for the LV thrombus and the normal LV
cavity. Conversely, papillary muscle com-
position includes fibrous tissue and smooth
muscle, which is quite different from blood
or clot components in the LV cavity and
thrombus. Therefore, observed densities and
quantitative blood concentrations in papil-
lary muscles are different from the normal
LV cavity and thrombotic lesions on the
isolated blood-based density images.
This study also demonstrated that the
LV thrombi could be reduced if a timely
and accurate anticoagulant and/or antith-
rombotic therapy, such as low-molecular
weight heparin sodium and warfarin, were
administered.
In addition to cardiac thrombi, cardiac-
occupying lesions include primary cardiac
tumours, cardiac metastases and infective
valvular vegetation. Spectral CT dual-
substance separation technology may
provide a new method to identify cardiac-
occupying lesions such as tumours. The
blood supply characteristics of cardiac
thrombus and tumours are different.
Kirkpatrick et al.21 adopted contrast-
enhanced ultrasound perfusion and found
no contrast-enhanced phenomenon in car-
diac thrombi due to a lack of blood supply.
Using this feature, it should be easy to
differentiate between cardiac thrombi and
tumours. Since the composition of cardiac
tumours is different from clots and blood
within the cardiac lumen, it is anticipated
that simultaneous comparative analysis of
the isolated blood- and iodine-based density
images on spectral CT for the same slice will
be helpful for differentiating cardiac throm-
botic lesions from tumours. This hypothesis
needs to be validated through future clinical
investigations.
This present study had a number of
limitations. First, the sample size was small
so these current findings should be inter-
preted as a `proof of principle', which dem-
onstrates the feasibility of this new method
for assessing cardiac thrombi. Future stu-
dies with larger sample sizes in which the
investigators are blind to the TTE results are
warranted to validate the present observa-
tional findings; and to determine the sensi-
tivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
and negative predictive value of this new
technique. Secondly, TTE examination was
used as the gold standard for the detection
of LV thrombi, but histopathological con-
firmation were not performed. Thirdly, no
validation or discrimination among diseases
such as cardiac tumours was undertaken,
and no atrium/left atrial appendage thrombi
were investigated in this study. It should be
noted that the current application of spectral
CT is still in its initial stages, therefore more
clinical experience and validation is
required.
In conclusion, spectral CT dual-
substance separation technology and the
derived images of blood- and iodine-based
64 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)
density allow the semiquantitative identifi-
cation of the tissue components of LV
thrombi. This technology provides a new,
simple, and feasible method for detecting
LV thrombotic lesions, and may provide a
new method for identifying other LV-occu-
pying lesions such as cardiac tumours.
Further validation with larger clinical sam-
ples is warranted.
