Abstract
ADAIR, LINDA S. AND BARRY M. POPKIN. Are child
eating patterns being transformed globally? Obes Res. 2005;
13:1281­1299.
Objective: To examine the extent to which child dietary
patterns and trends are changing globally.
Research Methods and Procedures: Diets of children 2 to
19 years of age were studied with nationally representative
data from Russia and the United States, nationwide data
from China, and regional data from metropolitan Cebu,
Philippines. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls were exam-
ined at several points in time to examine trends in calories
consumed away from home, snacking behavior, and soft
drink and modern fast food consumption. Urban­rural
trends were compared.
Results: U.S. and Cebu youth consume more than one-third
of their daily calories and a higher proportion of snack
calories from foods prepared away from home. In contrast,
away from home food consumption is minimal in Chinese
and Russian children. U.S. and Cebu youth consume about
one-fifth of their total daily energy from snacks, but snacks
provide a much lower proportion of energy in Russia
(16%) and China (where snacks provide only 1% of
energy). Fast food plays a much more dominant role in the
American diet (20% of energy vs. 2% to 7% in the other
countries), but as yet does not contribute substantially to
children's diets in the other countries. Urban­rural differ-
ences were found to be important, but narrowing over time,
for China and Cebu, whereas they are widening for Russia.
Discussion: This research suggests that globalization of the
fast food and other modern food sectors is beginning to
affect child eating patterns in several countries undergoing
nutrition transition. However, the contribution of fast food
and soft drinks to the diet of children remains relatively
small in China, Russia, and Cebu, Philippines, relative to
the United States.
Key words: away from home eating, fast food, snacking,
child diet trends
Introduction
Over the past 15 years, there is increasing evidence that
the structure of dietary intakes and the prevalence of obesity
among children around the world have been changing at an
increasingly rapid pace (1). Most available evidence, espe-
cially in the area of dietary behavior, comes from the United
States and other higher-income countries. Among the prom-
inent trends in these settings are increased snacking and
away from home consumption and a shift toward more fast
food and calorically sweetened beverages. There has been a
rapid global shift toward increased availability of fast foods
and processed foods, as well as changes in food distribution
and marketing, but it is not clear how these changes have
affected child diets.
Among U.S. children, changing dietary patterns are as-
sociated with concomitant increases in energy intake and a
higher percentage of calories from energy-dense nutrient-
poor foods and snacks (2­7) eaten at greater frequency
throughout the day (3,8). Additionally, an increasing num-
ber of meals are consumed away from home (2,4,6). From
1977 to 1996, the percentage of meals consumed from
restaurant and fast food sources jumped from 9.6% to
23.5% for the average American. This represents an in-
crease of 104% to 255%, depending on the age group (4).
Between 1994 and 1996, men 18 to 39 years of age obtained
17% of their total daily caloric intake from fast food estab-
lishments (9). The rise in food consumption away from
home is paralleled by the increase in commercial eating
places (89%) and fast food restaurants (146%). Using
spending as a measure of consumption, recent reports show
that "eating out" now accounts for nearly 40% of food
spending (2), and fast food sales increased 300% from 1970
to 1980.

Associated with the rise in fast and convenience food
outlets has been a shift in the types of foods being consumed
in the United States. Consumption of soft drinks, other
sweetened beverages, and fast food has increased dramati-
cally for adolescents (2­4,10,11). Although availability and
consumption of fruits and vegetables has been increasing
since 1970 (2,12), the average number of servings per day
remains far below the recommended levels (2). Lytle et al.
(13) found that, as children moved from the third to eighth
grade, fruit and vegetable consumption decreased by 41%
and 25%, respectively, whereas soft drink consumption
more than tripled. Concomitant decreases in milk and fruit
juice intake were also observed (13).
These patterns and trends are important because of their
potential health consequences for children. Past and ongo-
ing U.S. research is beginning to document how away from
home eating, including restaurant and fast food consump-
tion, and snacking and soft drink consumption increase total
energy intake and, thus, have consequences on child obesity
(14­19).
There is limited information about children outside of the
United States and Europe (20­23) and little comparative
study of trends in other parts of the world. In particular, we
lack information about countries undergoing rapid socio-
economic change. The focus of this paper is on changes in
the structure of diet among youth in Russia, China, and the
Philippines compared with the United States. We examined
trends in away from home consumption, snacking, and the
level of modern "Western" foods consumed. We used na-
tionally representative dietary data from the United States
and Russia, along with an eight-province survey from China
and a survey of a large metropolitan area in the Philippines
(7,24­27).
These countries were chosen for comparison for several
reasons. First, they represent different levels of moderniza-
tion and exposure to globalization of diet patterns. Of the
four settings, China is the poorest and was the most isolated
from modern food services such as fast food restaurants
until the 1990s. The United States represents the other end
of the spectrum. Second, our ongoing longitudinal studies in
China, Russia, and Cebu (Philippines) allow us to track
dietary changes over time in countries undergoing very
rapid socioeconomic transitions. Third, our long history and
intensity of research in these populations provides us with a
better understanding of the contexts in which change is
occurring. Given the potential health effects of trends in
snacking and away from home food consumption, our com-
parative research is important for its worldwide program
and policy implications.
Research Methods and Procedures
Survey Design and Sample
Table 1 summarizes broad similarities and differences
across the four studies.
United States. We used data from 2- to 18-year-old par-
ticipants in nationally representative surveys of the U.S.
population, namely the 1977 to 1978 (hereafter referred to
as 1977) Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS77)
and the 1989­91 (hereafter referred to as 1989) and 1994 to
1996 (hereafter referred to as 1996) Continuing Survey of
Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII96). The latter is com-
bined with the 1998 child supplement for children 2 to 9
years of age. The surveys from 1977 and 1989 included
stratified area probability samples of non-institutionalized
U.S. households in the 48 contiguous states and, in 1996, all
50 states. These surveys were self-weighting, multistage,
stratified area samples of the U.S. population. We used all
days of 24-hour recall data available from each survey.
Detailed information pertaining to each survey has been
published previously (7).

Russia. The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey is a
household-based survey of individuals and is the first na-
tionally representative sample from the Russian Federation.
We used the Phase II data collected in 1994 and 2003 from
4000 households in 65 primary sampling units. While
there was a longitudinal component to the survey, we used
the nationally representative cross-sectional sample in each
round. As with the U.S. data, sample weights and design
corrections were used for the Russian data. The Russia
sample was 76% urban, which corresponds to the national
average. One 24-hour recall was available from each survey
(26). Energy intake was calculated using food composition
tables developed by Skurikhin and Volgarev (28).
China. Analysis was based on data from the China Health
and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), an ongoing longitudinal
project (27). Samples from 1991 and 2000 were used. A
multistage, random cluster procedure was used to draw the
sample in eight provinces. While not designed to be nation-
ally representative, coverage was national. Counties in the
eight provinces were stratified by income (low, middle, and
high), and a weighted sampling scheme was used to ran-
domly select four counties in each province. In addition, the
provincial capital and a lower income city were selected.
Villages, townships within the counties, and urban and
suburban neighborhoods within the cities were selected
randomly. The survey included 190 primary sampling units
consisting of 32 urban neighborhoods, 30 suburban neigh-
borhoods, 32 townships, and 96 villages. Overall, the sam-
ple was 36% urban. Survey design controls, but not sample
weights, were used with these data.
The Chinese diet data were derived from 24-hour recalls
on 3 consecutive days, combined with cooking oil weighed
and measured at the household level. The latter provides an
accurate measure of the total edible oil used in household
cooking and, thus, a better measure of fat intake (29,30).
Energy intake was calculated using food composition
tables developed by the Institute of Nutrition and Food
Hygiene (31).
Cebu. We use data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health
and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS). In 1983, all pregnant
women living in 33 randomly selected urban and rural
communities of Metro Cebu, Philippines, were asked to
participate in this study. Their singleton infants, born within
a 1-year time period, were included and have been followed
since birth. The sample is 73% urban. Here, we used data
from the 1994 (n  2198), 1998 (n  2106), and 2002 (n 
2040) surveys when dietary intake was collected using two
24-hour dietary recalls. Cooking methods for each food
were noted, and fat and energy intakes were estimated for
oil added in cooking. Energy intake was calculated using
year-appropriate Philippines Food Composition Tables pro-
vided by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (32). As
was the case for the China data, survey design controls, but
not sample weights, were used with these data. In contrast to
the other data sets, the CLHNS is a regional sample focused
on a large urban center and surrounding rural areas, some of
which are on remote islands and in mountainous areas.
Age Groups
For China, Russia, and the United States, we analyzed
three age groups (2 to 5.9, 6 to 11.9, and 12 to 18.9 years of
age), as well as the total sample. The CLHNS is a cohort
study, and we used data from three survey rounds, when
participants had mean ages of 11.5, 15.5, and 17.9 years.
Eating Behaviors
Mothers served as proxy informants for children under 10
years of age in Russia and China, under 12 years of age in
the United States, and under 14 years of age in Cebu. For
each food listed in the 24 hour recalls, information was
collected on the eating occasion (whether considered by the
respondent to be a meal or snack) and place of preparation
and/or consumption. We were interested in place of prepa-
ration primarily to understand the extent to which there was
a pattern of increased consumption of foods fully prepared
away from home, particularly in the form of fast foods or
ready-made meals. The surveys were not directly compara-
ble in how food source was identified. For the United States,
information was available on where food was obtained and
whether it was ever in the home. We distinguished vending
machines, stores, and restaurants (including fast food) as
away from home sources. For Cebu, we collected only place
of preparation and identified restaurants, street vendors,
stores, and school feeding programs as away from home
sources. It should be noted, however, that school feeding
programs are limited and typically provide only bulgur as a
breakfast food to the poorest children. Place of consumption
was not known for Cebu. Thus, we could not determine the
extent of home consumption of foods prepared elsewhere
(e.g., take out foods consumed at home).
For Russia, data were derived from questions that asked
where each food was consumed and whether it was home
cooked or not. For place of consumption, we could differ-
entiate restaurant, school, and work from home. However, a
large number of foods were not home-cooked and, in these
cases, we could not determine where preparation took place.
However, we know from our experience in Russia and from
other analyses (33) that items such as bread purchased at
stores fall into this category. There is little or no tradition of
take-out food (i.e., purchase of ready-made foods that were
eaten at home) in Russia.
China is the only case where we have identically coded
information on place of preparation and place of consump-
tion. We, therefore, used China data to show how results
were affected by these distinctions.

To examine the thousands of foods contributing to energy
intake, food groups were developed for each country, with
U.S. groups serving as a model (34). The food groups were
structured to represent the main behaviors of interest.
We were interested in three main behaviors. The first was
consumption from specific food groups that represent po-
tentially unhealthy trends. We, therefore, defined groups
that represent the following: 1) fast food (pizza, hamburg-
ers, french fries, and other deep-fried items); 2) modern
snacks (salty snacks such as potato or corn chips, pretzels);
3) traditional snacks (for Russia, these include items such as
pumpkin and sunflower seeds; for China, these typically
include mixtures of preserved, salted, or roasted beans and
plums, and peanuts or sunflower seeds; for Cebu, these are
usually small rolls and similar bakery products); 4) candies
and desserts; and 5) soft drinks (calorically sweetened car-
bonated beverages and fruit drinks). Collectively, these
items are typically high in calories but low in micronutri-
ents. The second was meal patterns, with a focus on snack-
ing. The third was place of preparation and/or consumption,
examining the extent to which there was a trend of increased
intake of foods prepared entirely outside of the home.
Statistical Analysis
Given our focus on changing food patterns and eating
occasions rather than energy intake, all intakes are ex-
pressed as a percentage of total daily energy intake. Foods
were first categorized by food group and eating occasion
(snack vs. non-snack meal according to local definitions).
We calculated the percentage of total daily energy intake
contributed by each food group and further subdivided these
intakes into snacks and non-snack meals. For example,
snack calories are the total of all snack calories consumed
by the relevant population divided by the total calories
consumed by that population. Values represent average per
capita consumption for the sample, not intakes only among
consumers. Similarly, we calculated the percentage of daily
calories derived from foods prepared and/or consumed
away from home vs. prepared and consumed at home.
Values were averaged across the number of days available
for each child at each survey. Results were stratified by age
group within each survey year for China, Russia, and the
United States (2 to 5.9, 6 to 10.9, and 11 to 18.9 years of
age). Because Cebu participants were part of a cohort study,
all were similar in age at each survey round. The samples
were stratified by urban and rural residence to provide
additional data for the figures.
For the United States and Russia, survey means were
calculated using SAS 8.1 to control for survey design ef-
fects. Because our focus was on time trends, we assessed
differences by survey year within food groups, meal type,
and eating location using t tests, denoting statistical signif-
icance as p  0.01.
Results
Are There Shifts in Away from Home Dietary Intake?
The source of food (home vs. away from home) by meal
type (meal or snack) for children and adolescents from the
United States, Philippines, Russia, and China are presented in
Table 2. Children in Cebu and the United States consumed the
most calories from foods prepared away from home. Cebu
youth consumed nearly 40% of total calories from foods pre-
pared away from home. Snack foods in Cebu were predomi-
nantly prepared away from home (81.6% in 2002 to 90.3% in
1998). The foods prepared away from home and consumed as
snacks were typically small rolls and soft drinks purchased at
small stores or bakeries, whereas the away from home foods
consumed as meals more typically came from street vendors or
small cafeterias and included rice and vegetable dishes and
fried foods such as egg rolls. Home preparation of snack foods
increased over time, with levels in 2002 being 7 percentage
points higher than in 1994. This seems to represent an age-
related trend of consuming morning coffee with milk and
sugar, which was reported as a pre-breakfast snack.
In all age groups in the United States, the percentage of
calories consumed away from home increased significantly
from 1977 to 1996, such that by 1996, more than one-third
of calories were from away from home sources. While
young children (2 to 5.9 years of age) typically consumed
fewer calories from away from home sources, their increase
in time was substantial (e.g., nearly doubling from 13.3% of
total calories in 1977 to 25.6% in 1996). The trend, which
was similar for both meals and snacks, was accounted for
primarily by an increase in the percentage of calories con-
sumed at restaurants and fast food establishments.
By contrast, in 2003, Russian youth consumed only
15% of total calories, and in 2003, 32% of snack calo-
ries, away from home. There was no significant trend in
home consumption observed from 1994 to 2003.
In China, we found differences in the percentage of
calories prepared vs. consumed at home because some fam-
ilies consumed foods at home that were prepared elsewhere.
For total calories and meal calories, estimates based on
place of preparation and place of consumption were similar
because very few meals were purchased or consumed away
from home. For example, in 1991, 9.4% of total calories
were prepared away from home, but 6.6% of calories were
consumed away from home. Snack foods were more typi-
cally prepared away from home, even though they may have
been eaten at home. For example, in 2000, 37.1% of snack
calories were prepared away from home, but only 22.7% of
snack calories were consumed away from home.
Age differences were apparent in all countries. In the
United States, preschoolers consumed less food away from
home than older children. The opposite was found in China
and Russia, where younger preschoolers were fed a larger
proportion of their calories away from home, especially in
school programs.

Is Snacking Behavior Changing?
The extent of snacking and the contribution of snacks to
total energy intake varied widely across the four countries.
The results represent the composite of multiple snacking
occasions, particularly in the Philippines and the United
States. In the Philippines, snacking is very common, with an
afternoon snack a typical feature of the Cebu eating pattern.
Approximately 86% of Cebu sample youths reported con-
suming at least one food item as a snack in the 2002 survey,
and, on average, 18% of daily calories came from snacks,
mostly in the form of bakery products, soft drinks, and milk
and sugar added to coffee. The percentage of calories from
snacks declined as the cohort aged (with total energy from
snacks remaining relatively constant, but total energy intake
increasing, as would be expected as body size increases with
age). This trend reflects a decline in the percentage of youth
who consumed snacks and lower intakes among consumers.
Unfortunately, we cannot distinguish whether the overall
decline in percentage calories from snacks reflects an age
trend or a secular trend.
In the United States, snacking is also highly prevalent:
93.2% of youth reported consuming any food as a snack in

1996, and snacks contributed 22% of total calories in this
survey. This represents a large increase since 1977, reflect-
ing both an increase in the percentage of youth who reported
consuming a food as a snack and an increase in amount per
consumer. The prevalence of snacking is much lower in
China, with only 15.3% and 11.8% of Chinese youth re-
porting consuming any food as a snack in 1991 and 2000,
respectively. With so few snackers, 1% of total energy
comes from foods consumed as snacks, with no significant
trend between 1991 and 2000. Data from Russia do not
allow us to examine snacking trends over time. In the 2003
survey, 70.7% of youth reported consuming any food as a
snack, and 16% of energy was derived from snacking.
Are the Food Shifts Found in the United States
Common across the Globe among Children?
We defined food groups to capture potentially unhealth-
ful eating trends. The food groups account for different
proportions of all foods consumed, depending on the coun-
try. From the most recent surveys in each country, the
"other" category (foods not captured by the designated
groups) is smallest for the United States and Russia (32.2%
and 34.1% of total calories, respectively), intermediate for
Cebu (48.5%), and quite high for China (87.4%). This
pattern reflects the high consumption of staples (rice in
Cebu, rice and wheat products in China), which fall into the
"other" category. The percentage of snack foods not falling
into one of the named food groups is much smaller in each
country.
The United States is characterized by marked increases in
soft drinks and fruit drinks, fast food (french fries, ham-
burgers, cheeseburgers, pizzas, and Mexican food are the
major ones), and salty snacks (Table 3A­D). Intake of these
foods doubled from 10.5% to 21.2% of total energy intake
from 1977 to 1996. In Cebu, fast food consumption did not
significantly increase over time, but soft drinks consumed as
snacks more than doubled in Cebu youth from 1994 to 2002.
In Russia, these modern items represent only 1.3% of intake
in 1994, increasing to 2.1% in 2003. Consumption of these
items was negligible in China.
In the most recent survey data, soft drinks represented
8.5% of U.S. youth's total energy, 3% in Cebu, and less than
0.5% in China and Russia. In the United States, soft drink
consumption with meals showed a greater increase than as
a snack. Overall, consumption of fast food remains quite
low except in the United States.
Are the Food Shifts Found in the United States Linked
to Children Residing in Urban Areas?
The key results presented above for the total sample of
each country are stratified by urban or rural residence in
Figures 1­4. In China and Cebu, where there is rapid
economic growth, the proportion of energy from foods
prepared away from home was higher in urban areas in both
time periods, but the urban­rural difference declined over
time (Figure 1). In Cebu, there was a 12% urban­rural
difference in 1994, which declined to only 5% in 2002, as a
result of increasing away from home consumption among
rural youth and decreasing consumption among urban
youth. In China, the urban­rural difference was halved from
1991 to 2000. In contrast, in Russia, where economic in-
equality is great and minimal economic progress has oc-
curred in rural areas, we find a widening gap as the urban­
rural difference in percentage of away-from-home calories
went from 0.8% in 1994 to 6.4% in 2003. The differences in
the United States were also in the direction of more away
from home intake in rural areas.
Snacking behaviors also differed between urban and rural
areas. In all countries, a higher percentage of urban resi-
dents reported consuming snacks, and the urban­rural dif-
ference remained similar over time (Figure 2). Consistent
with the higher percentage of youth who reported consum-
ing snacks in urban areas, the percentage of calories from
snacks was also higher among urban youth (Figure 3).
An urban­rural difference in the consumption of calori-
cally sweetened beverages and fast foods is apparent in
Cebu but not in the other countries (Figure 4). In China and
Russia, consumption of these foods was quite low in all
areas, preventing any meaningful comparisons. In the
United States, soft drink consumption was slightly higher
among urban than among rural youth.
Discussion
While the expansion of global fast food franchises and
proliferation of local fast food establishments is a well-
recognized phenomenon (35,36), these data from large sur-
veys in China, Russia, and Cebu, Philippines, show that
there is not yet widespread consumption of fast food and
soft drinks among youth in these settings. Our comparison
of results across all four countries provides an indication of
the enormous heterogeneity of dietary patterns and trends
across the world. By no means do these results represent the
universe of patterns. We have examined, in the case of
China and Russia, countrywide trends and trends stratified
by a census-based urban­rural dichotomy. While one might
expect more consumption of modern, fast food in urban
areas, our data show only small urban­rural differences in
soft drinks and fast food use among youth in these countries.
It is possible that further analysis would reveal important
differences by region and in the most rapidly modernizing
cities compared with rural areas. In cities such as Moscow,
Beijing, and Shanghai, American fast food franchises sell-
ing hamburgers, pizza, and fried chicken are clearly visible
and proliferating. In Metro Cebu, the second largest urban
area of the Philippines, American and Cebu fast food es-
tablishments are common. However, the ratio of these to the
total population is very small relative to the United States,

and this may account for the low overall fast food consump-
tion and the small urban­rural differences we observed.
Away from Home Food Consumption
The most noticeable difference across the countries is in
away from home food intake. U.S. and Cebu youth consume
more than one-third of their total daily calories from foods
prepared away from home. In the United States, away from
home sources contribute similarly to meal and snack calo-
ries, whereas in Cebu, most snack calories (in the range of
80% to 90%) are from away from home sources. U.S. and
Cebu snack foods are typically processed or fast food
(United States), bakery products (Cebu), or soft drinks
(United States and Cebu). In addition, more meals are
purchased away from home and either eaten away (in res-
taurants or fast food establishments in the United States) or
brought home from small cafeterias and street vendors
(Cebu). In the United States, this trend has been attributed to
Figure 1: The proportion of total daily energy from foods consumed and/or prepared away from home by urban­rural residence.
Figure 2: The percentage of participants who reported consuming any food item as a snack by urban­rural residence.
Comparative Child Dietary Trends, Adair and Popkin
OBESITY RESEARCH Vol. 13 No. 7 July 2005 1295
a wide range of factors, including reduced food prices,
innovations that have reduced non-market household food
preparation time, increased access to the fast food and
restaurant sector, and unemployment (37­40). In Cebu,
small eateries are ubiquitous and for a long time have
provided an inexpensive and convenient alternative to home
food preparation.
In contrast, Chinese children consume very little of their
total energy from foods prepared or eaten away from home,
although more snack foods are purchased away from home.
Chinese snack foods are typically a biscuit, some peanuts,
or fruit. Eating in restaurants is rare in Chinese families, and
there is not a tradition of purchasing inexpensive foods from
street vendors as is the case in Cebu. Similarly, in Russia,

Figure 4: The percentage of total daily energy derived from modern fast foods (pizza, hamburgers, Mexican foods such as tacos) and soft
drinks or fruit drinks by urban­rural residence.
Comparative Child Dietary Trends, Adair and Popkin
1296 OBESITY RESEARCH Vol. 13 No. 7 July 2005
there is not yet a tradition of bringing ready-prepared foods
into the home nor is there a prevalent practice of taking
children to restaurants to eat.
Snacking
Snacking is common in the United States, Cebu, and
Russia, but few Chinese youth reported consuming snacks.
The contribution of snacks to total energy intake varies
substantially across the four settings, because the percent-
age of total calories derived from snacks for the entire
sample reflects differences in the both the number of snack
consumers and the amount consumed among snackers.
Thus, for China, the low prevalence of snacking translates
into only a trivial contribution of snacks to total energy
intake in the population of youth. The United States and
Cebu are characterized by a high level of snacking, with the
vast majority of youth consuming at least one food as a
snack on a daily basis. Snacking in these settings contributes
about one-fifth of total daily energy. Snacking can be an
important way to meet the energy and nutrient needs of
growing children, or it can lead to excess energy intake. For
example, whereas Cebu snackers had higher total energy
intakes, in many cases, these still fell below the current
recommended daily intake. In contrast, there is evidence
from the United States that snack calories contribute to
intakes in excess of needs and may contribute to obesity
(13,41­44).
Types of Foods Consumed
Fast food plays a much more dominant role in the Amer-
ican diet. U.S. youth consume close to one-fifth of all their
calories from sweetened beverages and fast food, whereas
youth in other countries consume 2% to 7% of their calories
from such food items. Nonetheless, as we have shown
elsewhere, the sweetening of diets reflected in total caloric
sweeteners consumed is a worldwide trend (10). Salty
snacks are increasingly important in the United States and
Russia, whereas soft drinks are increasingly consumed as
snacks by Cebu youth.
The low overall intake of modern fast foods in Russia and
parts of Asia may be partly accounted for by the relative
cost of these foods. The Cebu and China samples comprise
both urban and rural residents, many of whom live in quite
low-income households. Fast food remains relative expen-
sive, particularly in comparison with local home-based eat-
eries and street vendors and when fuel and time costs are
taken into account. For example, in Cebu, a fast food meal
of a small burger, french fries, and a soft drink costs about
$0.90, whereas a traditional meal of rice and a mixed meat
and vegetable dish purchased at a local eatery would cost
much less. In China, a burger, fries, and soft drink would
cost about $4.00 (30 Chinese Yuan), which is about four
times the cost of an equivalent traditional meal of rice and
a mixed meat and vegetable dish. Availability is also a
factor, with modern fast food options found primarily in the
most urbanized areas.
Urban­Rural Residence
As expected, urban residents engage more in the modern
eating behaviors as they consume more food away from
home, snack more often, and consume more fast foods and
soft drinks. The trends are mixed, and if anything, for away
from home behavior, there is a narrowing of the urban­rural
difference, and in many cases, there is no clear trend.
Health Implications
There is certainly growing evidence of the increase in
child obesity across the world (22), and some scholars have
shown how components of these dietary trends are part of
the child obesity epidemic (17,23,41,44).
A recent emphasis by the World Health Organization on
diet, activity, and obesity has highlighted the influence of
modern food processing and production and marketing in
changing worldwide diets (45,46). Among the World Health
Organization recommendations to governments were: 1)
discourage advertising of unhealthy dietary practices and
physical inactivity and 2) work with consumer groups and
the private sector to deal with marketing of food to children,
sponsorship, and advertising.
The results of this study do not invalidate this effort.
First, we do not provide evidence here on the penetration of
modern marketing and advertising into all of these coun-
tries. Second, we do not focus on modern urban areas such
as Moscow and Shanghai, where the penetration of modern
marketing techniques and fast food concerns is faster. Our
analysis has focused on population level trends rather than
trends within subgroups that might be at greater risk (e.g.,
higher income, more urban households). Our results for
China and Russia show, as yet, a minimum invasion of fast
foods and soft drinks on a countrywide level. Even in Cebu,
where there is an obvious proliferation of fast food estab-
lishments, there is relatively little consumption of fast food
items (aside from soft drinks) by Cebu youth in our sample.
To provide further context for our results, it is important to
note that the prevalence of overweight, using the definition
of the International Obesity Task Force (20) for children or
a BMI 25 kg/m2 for those 18 to 18.9 years of age, is
relatively low in our samples compared with the United
States. For example, the prevalence of overweight and obe-
sity was 11.2% in Chinese children 6 to 11 years of age and
5.5% among youth ages 12 to 18 years (China Health and
Nutrition Survey 2000 data); 9.7% in Russian children 7 to
13 years of age (47); and 5.4% in Cebu 18-year-old youth
(CLHNS2002).
What this study shows is that programs and policies to
encourage healthy eating will need to vary greatly in terms
of focus as we attempt to shift diets toward healthier ones
Comparative Child Dietary Trends, Adair and Popkin
OBESITY RESEARCH Vol. 13 No. 7 July 2005 1297
worldwide and to combat what has become a universal shift
toward greater child obesity. Further research should ad-
dress regional and socioeconomic differences in the trends
we report here as well as the specific relationship of these
trends to child health outcomes.
