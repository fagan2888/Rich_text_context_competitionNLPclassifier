Abstract
Objective: To determine whether frozen shoulder heals equally well in patients with and without
diabetes and whether dependency on insulin affects the outcome.
Methods: We retrospectively examined 178 patients with idiopathic frozen shoulder; 27 patients
had diabetes. We evaluated range of motion, pain, and functional results. The mean follow-up was
9.7 years (SD, 7.1 years).
Results: In the presence of frozen shoulder, range of motion did not differ between patients with
and without diabetes. At follow-up, range of motion in all directions of both the affected and
unaffected shoulders of patients with diabetes was inferior to that of patients without diabetes.
Among patients with diabetes, range of motion of the once-frozen shoulder reached the level of
the unaffected shoulder. Patients with and without diabetes experienced similar pain except during
exertion. The Constant­Murley score was not significantly different between the two groups, and
insulin dependency did not lead to worse outcomes.
Conclusion: Frozen shoulder heals well in patients with diabetes.

Introduction
Frozen shoulder among patients with dia-
betes is common. Its reported incidence
ranges from 10.0% to 36.0% and prevalence
ranges from 10.3% to 22.4%.1,2 In patients
with diabetes, problems tend to be more
persistent and more difficult to treat; poor
results, higher recurrence and inferior func-
tion have been reported after nonoperative
treatment, manipulation under anaesthesia
(MUA), open release or arthroscopic
capsular release.3­11 Conversely, many
researchers have reported no differences in
the outcomes of frozen shoulder between
patients with and without diabetes.7,12­24

We hypothesized that almost the same out-
comes of idiopathic frozen shoulder would
be achieved in patients with and without
diabetes.
Therefore, in the present study, we
retrospectively examined 178 patients (198
shoulders) with frozen shoulder, including
27 patients with diabetes (29 shoulders).
We evaluated long-term range of motion
(ROM), pain relief and functional results
during a follow-up period of 2 to 28 years
(mean, 9.7 Æ 7.1 years). We also studied
whether dependence on insulin affected the
outcome. This study is important because
the results of earlier studies concerning
the outcome of frozen shoulder in patients
with diabetes are very controversial.
Patients and methods
Ethics statement
We obtained permission to perform this
study from the ethics committee of the
study's hospital district and followed the
guidelines of the Helsinki declaration. All
participants provided written informed con-
sent before participation. This research
received no specific grant from any funding
agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-
profit sectors. The authors declare no con-
flict of interest in preparing this article.
Patients and study design
Two of the authors (M.V. and H.V.) retro-
spectively identified 231 patients with spon-
taneous idiopathic frozen shoulder seen by
the senior author from 1975 to 2006 and
evaluated 178 of these patients (198 idio-
pathic frozen shoulders); 27 (15%) of these
patients (29 shoulders) had diabetes. The
average follow-up time was 9.7 years (SD,
7.1 years). The inclusion criteria were no
trauma or only very minor shoulder trauma,
marked loss of active and passive shoulder
motion (forward flexion 135, abduc-
tion 135, restriction in external rotation),
normal findings in a true anteroposterior
radiograph of the glenohumeral joint and no
suspicion of rotator cuff tear at the first
consultation. The exclusion criteria were
intrinsic glenohumeral pathology, such as
glenohumeral arthritis or rotator cuff tear; a
history of substantial shoulder trauma; pre-
vious or subsequent shoulder surgery; reflex
sympathetic dystrophy of the ipsilateral
hand; previous or subsequent fracture of
the same shoulder area; and insufficient
medical records (no degrees of ROM men-
tioned). The patients' basic characteristics
are shown in Table 1. Of the 27 patients,
15 (56%) had insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus (17 shoulders) and 11 used no insulin,
and 1 patient with diabetes used only dietary
treatment. The mean age of all patients at the
first consultation was 52.6 years (range, 32­69
years) (with diabetes, 50 years; without dia-
betes, 53 years; p ¼ 0.034). All patients had
flexion of 135 while their shoulder was
frozen.
Of all 198 frozen shoulders, 110 (56%)
underwent MUA. The other 88 shoulders
underwent either conservative treatment or
observation. A total of 20 (11.2%) verified
bilateral frozen shoulders (2 patients with
diabetes) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The
right shoulder was involved in 43% of
patients. Of all 178 patients, 18% related
their onset of symptoms to some kind of
provocative action, such as throwing a rope.
Clinical evaluation
Initial evaluation included a detailed
medical history, physical examination, and
anteroposterior radiographs. Most patients
had already undergone shoulder radiographs
before the first consultation. No subjective
assessment occurred at this initial evaluation.
Each of the 178 patients underwent a phys-
ical examination by an independent observer
(H.V.) at the final follow-up similar to that in
the first consultation. The observer assessed
shoulder function with the Constant­Murley
1192 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
score and shoulder strength by manual
muscle testing; strength in abduction was
assessed using a Salter spring balance up to
11kg at increments of 0.2 kg.25 The presence
of a painful arc sign was indicated by ``yes''
or ``no.'' Additionally, a true anteroposterior
radiograph of the index shoulder was taken
in external rotation.
Questionnaire survey
Patients received questionnaires25 before the
final follow-up. The questionnaires assessed
demographics and symptoms of the once-
frozen shoulder, including pain evaluation on
a visual analogue scale (VAS) (range, 0­10;
0¼ no pain to 10¼ maximal imaginable
pain). Additionally, patients received the
Simple Shoulder Test. The Ethics Committee
of Helsinki University Hospital District
approved this study (No. 107, 19.9.2007).
Statistical analyses
Differences in age, follow-up time, and
ROM while the shoulder was frozen and
during follow-up between patients with
and without diabetes and between patients
with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-
dependent diabetes were determined using
a t-test; differences in dichotomous variables
were evaluated with Pearson's chi-square test.
Differences in shoulders between patients
with and without diabetes were assessed by
a paired-sample t-test. The statistical signifi-
cance threshold was set at p < 0.05 (two-
tailed). All statistical analyses were performed
with SPSS software (version 23.0; IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
ROM
ROM while the shoulder was frozen at the
same mean disease stage (8 vs. 7 months
from onset of symptoms) was not signifi-
cantly different between the 29 shoulders in
patients with diabetes and 169 shoulders in
patients without diabetes (Table 2). At the
final follow-up, ROM of the affected shoul-
ders in patients without diabetes improved
to the contralateral healthy level, but ROM
of the affected shoulders in patients with
diabetes remained below the contralateral
level of patients without diabetes (p < 0.001­
0.008). However, the final ROM was not
significantly different between the affected
and contralateral unaffected shoulders in
patients with diabetes. The mean difference
between the ROM in the affected and
unaffected shoulders in patients with dia-
betes was 5 in flexion, 5 in abduction, 1 in
external rotation, and 0 (no difference) in
internal rotation. Comparison of the

affected versus unaffected shoulders
between patients with and without diabetes
revealed no significant difference.
Manipulated shoulders of those with dia-
betes had similar ROM at final follow-up as
did others with diabetes and frozen shoul-
ders treated conservatively (follow-up: flex-
ion, 145 vs. 140; abduction, 153 vs. 155;
external rotation, 36 vs. 50; internal rota-
tion, L III vs. L III).
While the shoulder was frozen, patients
with insulin-dependent diabetes had worse
internal rotation and a greater tendency
toward inferior external rotation than did
patients with non-insulin-dependent
diabetes (15 vs. 30), but without statistical
significance (Table 3). However, they had
significantly worse inferior external rotation
at the follow-up (p ¼ 0.035). Other outcomes
were similar between patients with insulin-
dependent and non-insulin-dependent
diabetes.
Three patients with diabetes (11%) had a
follow-up ROM (flexion þ abduction þ
external rotation) of <220 (215, 190 and
190); one of them had internal rotation to
the L4 level, and the other two had internal
rotation only below the buttock. Their
Constant­Murley scores were 45.0, 40.6
and 34.0, respectively; one of them was

totally painless, and the others had a VAS
score of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively, at rest.
Pain
Patients without diabetes reported sig-
nificantly less pain during exertion than
did patients with diabetes according to
their VAS score (1.4 vs. 2.5, respectively;
p ¼ 0.034), but their pain at night (0.9 vs.
1.5) and during rest (0.6 vs. 0.9) were as low
as those in patients with diabetes (Table 2).
A total of 44% of patients without diabetes
and 28% of patients with diabetes had
totally painless shoulders; nine (6.0%)
patients without diabetes and two (7.4%)
patients with diabetes had a VAS pain score
of >3 with exertion, at rest and at night.
No difference in pain was present
between patients with insulin-dependent
and non-insulin-dependent diabetes (Table
3), nor was there any significant difference in
follow-up pain in patients with diabetes who
underwent conservative treatment versus
MUA.
Functional outcome
The Constant­Murley score was better in
patients without than with diabetes, but the
difference was not significant (82 vs. 76,
respectively). However, the Simple Shoulder
Test score was significantly better in patients
without than with diabetes (11 vs. 9, respect-
ively; p ¼ 0.005) (Table 2). No difference was
observed in functional scores between
patients with insulin-dependent and non-
insulin-dependent diabetes (Table 3).
Patients with diabetes had a positive
painful arc sign significantly more often
than did patients without diabetes (23% vs.
6%, respectively), but crepitus in the affected
glenohumeral joint was detected as rarely
(13% vs. 12%, respectively). Radiological
findings such as cystic degeneration or scler-
otic change at follow-up were not correlated
with diabetes.
Discussion
Most of the findings in the present study
support our hypothesis regarding the out-
come of frozen shoulder in patients with
diabetes. We hypothesized that their out-
come would be similar to that of patients
without diabetes. While the shoulder was
frozen, both at 7 to 8 months and 10 to
11 months from onset of symptoms, shoul-
der ROM was similar between patients with
and without diabetes. Likewise, Cinar et al.3
found no significant differences in the pre-
operative functional scores between these
groups of patients with frozen shoulder.
In the present study, the follow-up ROM
in patients with diabetes was inferior to that
of patients without diabetes in all directions.
According to Griggs et al., 4 diabetes in
patients with frozen shoulder is associated
with worse outcomes in terms of ROM. The
results of arthroscopic capsular release for
frozen shoulder in patients with diabetes are
also worse in terms of ROM.3 Mehta et al.8
reported significant improvement (p < 0.01)
in the modified Constant scores following
arthroscopic release for frozen shoulder in 21
patients with diabetes and 21 patients with-
out diabetes. The patients with diabetes had
significantly worse outcomes than those with-
out diabetes 6 months postoperatively
(p < 0.01) with a tendency toward persistent
limitation of movement 2 years postopera-
tively. Patients with diabetes reportedly also
have inferior results after open surgical
release.9 At follow-up in the present study,
however, the ROM of our patients' once-
frozen shoulder reached the same level as their
unaffected shoulder. The ROM in the frozen
shoulder was not inferior to that in their own
unaffected shoulder. This is the main finding
in the present study that differs from the
results of other studies. We found no other
studies that compared the outcome ROM
between the once-frozen and unaffected
shoulder in the same patients with diabetes.
Many studies have shown that diabetes is
not a risk factor affecting either the objective
1196 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
or subjective outcome of frozen shoulder
after nonoperative treatment.13,14,16,18,20,26
Du
¨ zgu
¨ n et al.14 found no significant differ-
ences in ROM, functional activity status,
pain level or muscle strength before and
after rehabilitation between 12 frozen shoul-
ders in patients with diabetes and 38
frozen shoulders in patients without dia-
betes. In other studies, diabetes did not
affect the outcome after arthroscopic capsu-
lar release,15,22 after MUA12,21 or between
patients treated operative and nonopera-
tively.17 Some authors, however, report
conflicting results.27,28 In the present study,
the ROM in patients with diabetes recovered
to the ROM level of their own contralateral
shoulder, but not to the ROM level of that in
patients without diabetes.
Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes
are more likely to require arthroscopic
release than are patients with non-insulin-
dependent diabetes.29 In the present study,
insulin-dependence showed no effect on
flexion or abduction while the shoulder
was frozen or on the outcome of pain or
function; however, the outcome of external
rotation was inferior. If a patient's history of
insulin-dependent diabetes is >10 years,
only about 25% of patients partially
respond to manipulation alone.30 However,
the duration of diabetes in the patients of the
present study is unknown.
In one study, pain was present in 26% of
patients with diabetes but in no patients
without diabetes.3 In another study, the
average VAS pain score was 4.3 among
patients with diabetes and 1.1 among those
without diabetes after open surgical release.9
In the present study, the outcome concerning
pain was similar between patients with and
without diabetes at rest and during the night,
but was slightly worse during exertion.
With respect to function, one study
showed that the average Constant­Murley
score was 82 in patients with diabetes and 94
in patients without diabetes (p < 0.05).3
Other studies showed average American
Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder
scores of 61 and 759 and Oxford Shoulder
Scores of 41 and 43, respectively (p< 0.001).7
The Constant­Murley scores in the present
study were in accordance with our hypoth-
esis. However, patients with diabetes self-
evaluated their function as being inferior to
that of controls in the Simple Shoulder Test.
Frozen shoulder (patients) with diabetes
mellitus have a more severe course and more
resistance to treatment compared to (general
population) with frozen shoulder.7,31,32 The
proportion of patients with diabetes was
much greater than that of patients without
diabetes among those who developed recur-
rence after MUA. One-half of the patients
with insulin-controlled diabetes and one-
quarter of those with non-insulin-controlled
diabetes required a second MUA.11 The
outcomes of MUA in the present study,
however, do not support this. Patients with
diabetes also reportedly have inferior results
after open surgical release,9 and one study
showed that patients with diabetes had
slower postoperative functional recovery
during the first 12 months following arthro-
scopic capsular release.33
We acknowledge that the present study
has limitations. First, we did not obtain the
Constant­Murley scores or the Simple
Shoulder Test scores when the patients
were initially examined. However, ROM
and strength measurements were available.
Second, we presented pooled data compris-
ing 45% patients not yet appearing in the
literature. We consider this adequate, how-
ever, because the purpose of the earlier
papers was not to compare patients with or
without diabetes and because our study
schedule was similar for all patients.
The mean follow-up time in the 12 studies
that showed no effect or a questionable
effect of diabetes on the outcome of frozen
shoulder was 2.5 years (range, 0.1­7.0
years), with a mean of 14 (range, 3­28)
patients per study. The 3 studies2,6,8 that
reported inferior results of frozen shoulder in
Vastama
¨ki et al. 1197
patients with diabetes had a mean follow-up
time of 3.0 years (range, 1.6­4.0 years) and a
mean of 19 (range, 6­22) patients with
diabetes. Our clinical follow-up time was
9.9 years among 29 shoulders in patients
with diabetes. We found no studies exceed-
ing our clinical follow-up time or exceeding
our number of frozen shoulders in patients
with diabetes. Jenkins et al.7 reported the
3.4-year outcome for 22 diabetic patients
with frozen shoulder in a questionnaire
study with a mean clinical follow-up time
of only 3 weeks.
In terms of what this study adds to existing
knowledge, we have shown that the follow-
up ROM of the once-frozen shoulders in
patients with diabetes reach the same level as
their own unaffected shoulders. Additionally,
we have confirmed the results of some other
authors showing that there are otherwise no
differences in outcomes in frozen shoulders
between patients with and without diabetes.
This leads us to believe that frozen shoulder
actually heals as well in patients with diabetes
as in patients without; other diabetes-related
factors appear to cause joint mobility to
worsen over time in this patient population.
