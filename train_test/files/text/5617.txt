Introduction
Given the fact that "bioethics" and, more specifically,
"applied" or "practical" ethics have come to wield an increas-
ing degree of influence (cf. Littoz-Monnet, 2014), there is a
pressing need to theorize and thereby comprehend the way
such expertise not only works but could be made to work.
However, despite a reasonable significant body of bioethical
scholarship on the topic (Noble, 1982; Rasmussen, 2005;
Singer, 1972), there seems little of normative value. The
analysis presented below attempts to move the debate for-
ward by drawing on the work of Collins and Evans (2002,
2007), whose theory of expertise is explicitly positioned as
normative. However, my remarks do not consider "bioethics"
as a whole but on a particular and, one might add, dominant
aspect of this interdiscipline, namely, "applied ethics" or that
part of bioethics that can be considered to be offering a spe-
cific and challenging form of ethical expertise. Furthermore,
my analysis is conducted in the particular context of "medical
ethics" and concerns the relationship between ethics in medi-
cal practice and the scholarly endeavor of applied (medical)
ethics. The exegesis is social theoretical and, broadly, rooted
in a contemporary "theory of practice" perspective. As such,
my interest is not restricted to a descriptive theorization but
represents a critical engagement with implications for the
reconstruction of the relationship between, on one hand, clini-
cal practitioners and the health care professions and, on the
other, experts in applied ethics. With this in mind, one might
position this essay as a socio-analysis of the ethics of bioeth-
ics or, more accurately, the ethics of applied ethical exper-
tise. However, in the same way as sociological research into
science is indifferent to the methodological and epistemo-
logical claims of its object, I am largely indifferent to the
internal methodological and meta-ethical commitments
embedded in the disciplinary practice I seek to analyze. My
analysis is grounded in a sociological or social theoretical
perspective; it is self-consciously constituted as external to
the philosophical practice known as applied ethics, a main-
stay of bioethics. Thus, while it can be understood as a kind
of ethical analysis, it cannot be considered a form of applied
or practical ethics.
As this introductory paragraph suggests, I am, for the pur-
poses of analysis, distinguishing something called "applied
ethics" from "bioethics" or even "ethics" more generally.
First, while they can be seen as forming the core of the field,
bioethics encompasses more than "applied ethics" or even
"ethics." It is a multi- and inter-disciplinary endeavor that
encompasses historical, sociological, and anthropological

A Sociological Analysis of Ethical
Expertise: The Case of Medical Ethics
Nathan Emmerich1
Abstract
This article outlines a theoretical and conceptual account for the analysis of contemporary ethical or "bioethical" expertise.
The substantive focus is on the academic discipline of bioethics--understood as a "practical" or "applied" ethics--and its
relationship to medicine and medical ethics. I draw intellectual inspiration from the sociology of science and make use of
research into the idea of "expertise" per se. In so doing, I am attempting to move the debate beyond the limitations placed
upon it by philosophical or meta-ethical analysis and develop a perspective than can be used to address the sociological
reality of (bio)ethical expertise. To do so, I offer the terms ethos and eidos to provide a basic conceptual framework for
the sociological analysis of "morality" and "ethics." I then turn to an exegesis of Collins and Evans's account of ubiquitous,
contributory, and interactional expertise and situate these topics in relation to academic bioethics and medical practice. My
account suggests a particular understanding of the kinds of relationships that "bioethics" should seek to foster with the social
fields it endeavors to not only comment on but also influence.

perspectives. Second, my aim is to analyze bioethical exper-
tise in such a way as to face up to what I consider the "hard
problem" of a specifically ethical expertise. Thus, my focus
is on "applied ethics," which, as a mode of ethical analysis,
presents itself with a greater degree sense of normative con-
clusion than other forms of disciplined ethical analysis or
even "normative ethics" in general. While the "authority" of
such conclusions is, it is claimed, a function of "the argu-
ment" rather than "the author," it is nevertheless the case
that, one, applied ethics is a methodologically disciplined,
specialist and, therefore, expert activity, and two, it is a mode
of analysis that is strongly aimed at being broadly guiding
action or practical.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the notion of an applied ethics is
not easy to specify, at least not fully. In the first instance, one
might note that the application of moral theory to ethical
problems is not a simple one (Beauchamp, 1984; Gert, 1984;
Hoffmaster, 1991; Kamm, 1988, 1995; Kopelman, 1990;
MacIntyre, 1984; Wolf, 1994). Furthermore, despite the sup-
posed differences between them, applied ethics encompasses
both "principlist approaches" as well as those that claim to
be based in broader conceptions of our "common morality"
(Beauchamp & Childress, 2009; Clouser & Gert, 1990;
Davis, 1995; Gert, Culver, & Clouser, 1997, 2000; Green,
Gert, & Clouser, 1993; Lustig, 1992, 1993; Richardson,
2000). For the present purposes, it is, I think, better to con-
sider applied ethics as a style of argument or a mode of ethi-
cal rationality. This approach to ethics is fundamentally
philosophical but, nevertheless, has an essentially practical
ambition meaning that, as London (2001) suggests with
regard to the more general phenomena of normative or "prac-
tical" ethics, applied ethics exhibits a certain degree of inde-
pendence from philosophical moral theories. Nevertheless,
applied ethics is not as intersubjectively accommodating as
London suggests of practical ethics. Indeed, for the most
part, the academic and analytic values embedded in the dis-
ciplinary field of practice mean that a virtue is made of robust
disagreement and the resulting tenor that colors the exchange
of ethical argument.
One way to characterize the practice of applied ethics is
by reference to the particular set of values that distinguish it
from other forms of practical ethics such as casuistry, dis-
course ethics, reflective equilibrium, and feminist ethics. Of
particular interest is, I think, the way in which the values
underpinning ethical analysis affect the relationship between
it and the notion of politics and political debate. There are, no
doubt, a variety of other reasons one could consider in exam-
ining such differences. Casuistry, for example, rejects "the
tyranny of principles" (S. E. Toulmin, 1981). However, it is
the variation in perspective on "politics" that most clearly
reveals important variations in argumentative and analytic
style. According to Radcliffe-Richards, applied ethics is
prior to--and has priority over--politics.As she puts it, there
is "a crucial distinction between debates about policies or
actions that are under consideration, and debates about what
constraints or limits should be imposed on those consider-
ations from the outset" (Radcliffe-Richards, 2012, p. 134).
Although discourse ethics, reflective equilibrium, and even
feminist ethics all offer disciplined forms of ethical argu-
ment, there is a less sharp distinction between them and con-
cerns of a more political nature. Indeed, the approach taken
to ethics by these analytic modes is not apolitical but shaped
by political concerns. While some have questioned the idea
that applied ethics is, in fact, apolitical (Evans, 2012; Tronto,
2011), it nevertheless remains a presumption fundamental to
the endeavor. Although we need not challenge this conceit at
the level of methodology--many of the underlying perspec-
tives presumed by many intellectual endeavors are, when
considered sociologically, essentially treated as methodolog-
ical rather than philosophical commitments--there is no
need to adopt it ourselves. Thus my arguments do not, at
least not explicitly, aim at the methodological destabilization
of applied ethics. Rather they aim to situate the expertise of
applied ethicists in its broader socio-cultural and poltical
context and, consequentiually, question the ethics of such
expertise.
The approach to ethical analysis adopted by applied ethics
achieves its generality (if not universality) through an attempt
at ethical objectivity, the form of which is reliant not only on
its apolitical stance but also through being socially, cultur-
ally, and historically decontextualizing. Different approaches
to ethics vary in the degree to which they pursue (or value)
the same kind of ethical objectivity and, therefore, the degree
to which they are similarly decontextualizing in their analy-
sis. Although feminist ethics seeks to retain and recognize
the ethical importance of gender and its associated, and his-
torically variable, socio-cultural norms, discourse ethics can
be characterized as something that "embeds the practice of
disembedding" (Anderson, 2005, p. 178). The most appro-
priate way to characterize the distinction between different
forms of ethical analysis is, at least for the socio-analytic
purposes at hand, not simply by placing them on a spectrum
with regard to their socio-political sensitivity but through
reference to Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblance. To
anticipate something of the below argument, ethical analysis
proceeds according to the particular, and largely implicit,
values, norms, and principles that constitute the ethos of the
disciplinary field. The differences between different modes
of ethical analysis exist at this level, the level ethos; there-
fore, the relevant family resemblances also exist at this level.
Thus, while my analysis focuses on the expertise of applied
philosophical approaches to (bio)ethics, it remains an exam-
ple of the more general phenomena of "normative" or "prac-
tical" ethics.
Furthermore, regardless of their methodological stripes or
meta-ethical perspectives, we might also note that what
expert ethicists actually do is highly consistent. Their pri-
mary task is to develop and present ethical arguments and to
do so in the form of journal articles. To do so, they read simi-
lar articles, remain abreast of the substantive fields they
Emmerich 3
comment upon, and give presentations to their peers and to
other interested individuals or groups. Furthermore, they do
so on the basis of their disciplinary knowledge. This is some-
thing that is, first, likely to encompass various approaches to
ethical analysis and, second, the result of a long period of
education and experience. Thus, while applied ethics may
claim that any "moral authority" is a function of what
Habermas (1993) calls the "unforced force of the better argu-
ment" (p. 163), it remains the case that we are not all equally
able when it comes to the evaluation of such arguments.
Thus, while my concern is with the more "rationalist" form(s)
of ethical expertise, this is not because I believe it to be the
correct, best, or even most expert form of ethical analysis.
Rather, it presents the most compelling challenge to the theo-
rization of ethical expertise, what I have, above, termed the
hard problem of ethical expertise. The audience for the argu-
ments of applied ethics is not restricted to other disciplinary
specialists (experts) or to those with a formal grounding in
any of the various approaches to practical ethics.
For example, while some members of the medical and
health care professions may have been exposed to applied
ethics, perhaps to the extent of taking a masters level course
in the subject, most will have had limited exposure to this
disciplined mode of thought. While it is perhaps true to say
that it is feasible for non-specialists or non-experts to read
academic articles published in specialist applied ethics jour-
nals--certainly it would seem more feasible than asking a
non-expert to read an article published in an academic bio-
chemistry journal--it is nevertheless the case that some
expertise, cognitive skills, or domain-relative reflective
capability is required. Indeed, that this is the case would
seem to be a motivating assumption for the ethical education
of professionals, at least insofar as such education aims at the
intellectual (analytic, reflective, or "cognitive") develop-
ment of such professionals and not merely at providing them
with factual information about existing debates. From this
point of view, we need to get to grips with the expertise of
applied ethicists. Denying its existence on philosophical or
meta-ethical grounds prevents us from engaging with the
practical consequences of applied ethics as a specialist, dis-
ciplined, and academic endeavor. We must come to some sort
of resolution regarding the ethical expertise embedded in this
domain if we are to fully address the broader cultural and
socio-political role of applied ethics, particularly in the con-
text of bioethics. This point not only applies to ethics in med-
icine, the topic of this essay, but also to public debates and
the broader political discourses within which public policy is
formed. Although exploration of this point will have to await
another forum if it is to be fully explored, we might note that
the conceptual specifics of ethical expertise may well vary
over differing contexts. Nevertheless, the following com-
ments present and explore an account that can, at least, be
used as a starting point for further analysis of the distinctly
modern (or "modernist") phenomena of applied philsophical
(bio)ethics and problem of ethical expertise more generally.
Ethos and Eidos: Morality and Ethics
From a Sociological Perspective
Given that bioethics is dominated by philosophical forms of
ethical analysis, and that existing analysis of ethical exper-
tise has tended to originate within the field, there would seem
to be scope for alternative perspectives to make a significant
contribution. Indeed, for the most part, existing work on ethi-
cal expertise has neglected the substantial corpus of research
into expertise per se. This corpus can, I think, be used to
illuminate a number of difficulties in this area. Consistent
with practice theory, such views "reinforce the conception of
ethics as Hegelian Sittlichkeit as opposed to Kantian
Moralität" (Schatzki, 2001, p. 23, Note 8); it suggests we
adopt a sociological perspective on practical and applied eth-
ics so that they can be addressed as a form of intellectual,
reflective, or analytic practice embedded in disciplinary
field(s). Such a view further suggests that we consider this
field--and its practices--as a part of a broader moral culture.
To do so is to invite the reconceptualization of the relation-
ship between "common morality" and "applied" or "practi-
cal" ethics. It is to situate formal ethics (moralität) within or,
at least, in relation to informal or common morality (or sit-
tlichkeit). While the formal nature of applied ethics can be
understood as an attempt to eliminate the contingency of
moral value in favor of rational argument, the view adopted
here is that such practices are nevertheless embedded in a
particular culture, a mode of social life. As such, they are,
like any other practice, inherently situated and unavoidably
value-laden.
While some recent developments in philosophical bioeth-
ics (cf. Kukla, 2014) compliment this kind of view, it remains
a philosophically heterodox account. However, bioethical
research conducted from a sociological and/or anthropologi-
cal perspective more clearly compliments my account. For
example, Fox and Swazey (1984) differentiate between
"medical morality" and (practical or applied) "bioethics."
Kleinmann (1995, p. 45) offers a similar account, and it can
be found in more broadly focused texts (Edel & Edel, 2000,
pp. 8-10; Geertz, 1957, p. 421; Gregg, 2003, p. 102).
Although I use relatively novel terms--namely, ethos and
eidos1--to relate (common) morality or "sittlichkeit" to eth-
ics or "moralität," they not only stand alongside such views,
but I have also made complimentary use of them elsewhere
(Emmerich, 2014; in press).2 In making use of them here, my
aim is to show that any form of ethical expertise can be
understood as a historically constituted and socially situated
form of expertise, the practice of which is embedded in par-
ticular cultural contexts.
The stance I adopt can be considered as an attempt to
draw our attention to the difference between the broad nor-
mative "social" (sociological) or "cultural" (anthropologi-
cal) structuring of a society, culture, or a particular field and
the comparatively narrow conception of normativity attached
to "practical" and, in particular, "applied" ethics and the
4 SAGE Open
cognitive structures of individual thought.3 Anyone with a
passing acquaintance with the social sciences can perceive
the relevance of the perennial debate concerning structure
and agency and their role(s) in "causing" action(s) or, nowa-
days, producing "practices" (Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, & von
Savigny, 2000). In a social theoretical perspective, the indi-
vidual and society are intertwined, inescapably enmeshed in
a (creative) process of mutual reproduction. Consequentially,
we might think similarly for "morality," the normative char-
acter of a particular society or culture, and "ethics," a reflec-
tive practice and generalized "mode of thought." If we adopt
the terms ethos and eidos, this point can be given greater
clarity. If we consider morality and ethics as, respectively,
ethos and eidos, then former can be taken to refer to the par-
ticular ethos of a social field or the normative character of
"thick culture." In contrast, ethics can be taken to refer to a
culturally particular eidos or the characteristic way of ethical
thinking found within a particular culture. Regardless of
whether such thinking is considered "thick" or, like bioeth-
ics, "thin," it is always embedded in a particular culture or
ethos. As such, any eidos, any mode of thought, or socio-
logic4 is an aspect of ethos. Eidos names a part of ethos that,
in some cases, it is useful to identify as it focuses our atten-
tion on the nature of reason as a practice, something that is,
therefore, shaped by the socio-historical and cultural condi-
tions of its production.
While the term ethos and the idea of a society's moral
character are ripe for further exploration, it is, nevertheless,
a reasonably common idea, both in moral philosophy and in
sociological and anthropological research. However, the
concept of eidos and the idea of characteristic way(s) of
(ethical) thinking are relatively unexplored and require fur-
ther exploration. As I use it, eidos is an anthropological term
and originates with Gregory Bateson (1958).5 However,
while it is found in Madge's (1964) Society in the Mind:
Elements of a Social Eidos, few other authors have taken it
up. Bateson's purpose was to explore the particular "logic"
of Itamul culture and to do so in a manner related to its
broader ethos. However, partially due to its distance from
"ethos," he was dissatisfied with the term logic and, on
reflection, realized that his conception of ethos could be
subdivided into "ethos" and "eidos" with the latter encom-
passing the "logic(s)" of a particular culture (Bateson, 1958,
p. 25, Footnote 1; pp. 264-265). To be clear, it is not simply
that "ethos" is holistic, collective, and affective or that
"eidos" is individualistic and associated with cognition,
reflection, and thought. Rather, while one is predominantly
associated with the affective and the other with the cogni-
tive, both are dimensions of a particular cultural "whole"--
with a particular form of life (or, perhaps more accurately, a
specific mode of social life). Furthermore, even when appar-
ently individual, both are inescapably collective and, there-
fore, social phenomena. While they can be conceptually
distinguished, they are not separable in practice; any eidos is
always part of an ethos.
In this view, morality and ethics, ethos and eidos, are both
structural aspects of a culture as well as of individuals situ-
ated within the relevant contexts. Thus, when Bateson (1958)
uses the term eidos to name a "general picture of the cogni-
tive processes" (p. 25) native to a specific culture and sug-
gests that the "eidos of a culture is an expression of the
standardized cognitive aspects of the individuals, while the
ethos is the corresponding expression of their standardized
affective aspects" (p. 33), it indicates that both can be per-
ceived in a variety of cultural artifacts as well as in the con-
crete practices (actions and interactions) of individuals. We
should, therefore, be able to read the ethical eidos of, say,
medicine into a wide variety of its cultural products, includ-
ing guidelines, procedural documents, editorials, and consul-
tations. We might also adopt the view that differing
disciplinary approaches to ethics differ in their eidos and, in
no small part, their (intellectual) ethos, what Hämäläinen
(2009) terms the theoretical spirit of differing moral philoso-
phies. Furthermore, given the connection between bioethics
and the moral landscape of modern medicine, it can also be
read in the discourse of applied ethics, particularly in venues
where the ethical discourses of academics and professionals
meet. In suggesting that medical ethics is part of this broad
picture of the eidos of medicine, we can begin to explore
how, and where, it connects with the ethos or thick moral
culture of medicine. We can also explore how medical ethics
differs when located in different social or cultural spaces;
consider the difference between medical ethics when pur-
sued as part of applied ethics and when it is a part of medical
practice (whether in clinic or as part of broader professional
discourses). Consider also the connection or relationships
between these modes of thought.
Perhaps the most obvious, or simply succinct, example of
a bioethical eidos is Beauchamp and Childress's (2009) (four)
Principles of Biomedical Ethics. Drawing on Bateson, Madge
(1964) considers the eidos to be a "predominant character of
the whole stock of ideas available in a society or group" (p.
13). "Ideas" are here regarded as "elements in a repertoire or
vocabulary of knowledge and belief" (p. 111). Thus, while the
four principles of medical ethics might be the dominant rep-
ertoire or vocabulary--the preeminent stock of ideas--which
characterize (bio)ethical thinking in modern medical practice,
there is more to the concept of the ethical eidos of medicine.
We might first suggest that what characterizes the ethical way
of thinking of contemporary medical practice is its "princi-
plism" rather than, simply, four principles. Although its initial
introduction to medicine was as a challenge to the moral ethos
of the time (something we might call paternalism), the fact
that it has now been widely adopted by the health care profes-
sions indicates that it has become part of medical culture.
Over the past five decades, medical morality has developed in
such a way as to be compatible with a principlist medical eth-
ics. Indeed, Brodwin (2008) recently positioned them as co-
productive. Thus, we can say that the particular ethical eidos
that exists within contemporary medical culture is related to
Emmerich 5
that of practical ethics and, in particular, its preeminent form,
applied ethics. Nevertheless, we can also maintain the view
that the morality of medical culture remains a more expan-
sive concept. Medical morality is the broad normative struc-
ture of the field; it is its ethos. As an aspect of medical
practice (and governance), the eidos of contemporary medi-
cal ethics exists within, and is conditioned by, the ethos med-
icine. This can be contrasted with medical ethics as an
academic mode of thought, the eidos of which is not embed-
ded in "medical morality" but the alternative ethos of various
forms of practical and, in the particular case at hand, applied
ethics. In this context, theorizing ethical expertise does not
simply concern the specialist practice of applied ethics. If we
are to articulate a notion of ethical expertise, we must do so
by attending to its relation to the ethically non-expert indi-
viduals, fields, and practices that applied ethics not only
comments upon but attempts to normatively shape.
Ubiquitous Expertise
The "commonsense view" of expertise is of something nec-
essarily limited to a small section of the population and usu-
ally predicated on a body of technical knowledge. In contrast,
contemporary perspectives on expertise consider types of
expertise that can be assigned to the majority of individuals
and do not require any technical knowledge. Thus, for exam-
ple, driving a car or even simple walking is considered to
involve expertise or its performance. These abilities can be
further expert when done in a particular social context; thus,
walking down a busy street or driving across a city involves
not only walking but also the additional expert task of nego-
tiating traffic (people or cars). Such views have emerged
from phenomenological critiques of early research into
robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the "cognitive sci-
ence" that attended such projects (Dreyfus, 1979, 1992).
To accomplish our everyday activities, we must negotiate
the moral order or ethos of our socio-cultural setting(s). Our
ability to do so can be considered a form of ubiquitous exper-
tise. For the most part, this negotiation is accomplished auto-
matically or intuitively. For example, we do not need to
reflect on the requirement to thank those who assist us nor do
the Japanese have to reflect on how deep or long to bow
when greeting a guest.6 Articulating a "practice theory" per-
spective, Zahle (2013, 2014) recently argued that, as embod-
ied beings, we perceive the normative aspects of social
situations directly. Thus, the ethos, or moral structure, of a
society should be understood as coloring the individual's
social perception. Indeed, pace Bourdieu's (1993) social the-
ory, we might consider ethos to be dispositionally embodied
in habitus and, therefore, "a morality made flesh" (p. 86).
Certainly, in some cases, our moral responses to social situa-
tions are not simply a matter of habit, tacit knowledge, or
intuition. Some situations require the articulation of reasons
for action, perhaps as part of the activity itself, while other
situations may actively provoke further reflection on what
the correct course(s) of action might be. In such situations,
the individual might reflect and decide, which is to say they
might make use of the relevant eidos, before acting. However,
as this ability is common to all members of the relevant com-
munity, it remains a matter of ubiquitous expertise. While
research has made it clear that individuals can be morally
dumbfounded, this effect can be construed as demonstrating
that, in everyday life, our moral intuitions and reflective ethi-
cal thinking usually work in concord with each other (Haidt,
Bjorklund, & Murphy, 2000). While not denying the exis-
tence of "reflective agency," such "ordinary," "everyday," or
"mundane" ethical reflections can be considered part of our
embodied moral response to particular social situations and
cultural stimulus.
While certain situations can provoke a reflective response,
we should be clear that this activity differs from the task of
applied ethics. There is a tendency to assume that our every-
day ethical thinking is simply a relatively undisciplined ver-
sion of the philosophical analysis brought to bear on matters
of practical ethics. This is a misguided assumption both
empirically and within the theoretical picture being sketched
here (Hedgecoe, 2004). While the ethical eidos of a society is
intertwined with its moral ethos, applied ethicists seek to
remove any trace of the affective moral ethos from their phil-
osophical analyses.7 The broader social ethos cannot be con-
sidered that of the academic community any more than the
broader social eidos can be that of disciplined reflection.
Particularly in its applied guides, practical ethics is the meth-
odological attempt to construct "objective" ethical argu-
ments that are free of affective content. It is the ethicists'
attempt to fully explicate their intuitive moral judgments
and, therefore, render tacit moral knowledge explicit. Of
course, the result is not merely a reflection of the original
judgment or common morality but the production and pur-
suit of academic arguments. This is not something that can
occur in the flow of everyday moral and ethical practice as
they are characterized by our tacit moral knowing and intu-
itions. This remains the case even when we engage in every-
dayethicalreflection,dialogue,anddebate.Suchubiquitously
expert practices should be understood on their own terms and
not through the disciplined lens of applied ethics.
The ubiquitous moral and ethical expertise of social actors
is reiterated in the context medical practice and education.
One aspect of the education of medical students is their
moral socialization, a process of induction into the culture,
normative structure, and ethos medicine (Hafferty & Franks,
1994). This process runs alongside the formal education of
medical students, including their formal education in medi-
cal ethics. Attempts to integrate such ethical education into
the clinical context, that is, with the more informal aspects of
medical education, can be seen as an attempt to forge a peda-
gogic connection between medical ethics and medical moral-
ity.Insuchacontext,wecanconsidertheethicalenculturation
of medical students as something that runs alongside, and as
a compliment to, their moral socialization (Emmerich, 2013,
6 SAGE Open
2014). During their medical education and beyond, medical
students become increasingly able to negotiate the ethos and
eidos of medicine. In the case of morality and ethics, this
means they become increasingly able to perceive and respond
to the normative structure of medicine and medical practice
as well as to reflectively comprehend the issues at hand, that
is, by reference to the principles of medical ethics, relevant
guidelines, or other such formal ethical structures of the
medical profession. To successfully practice as doctors, med-
ical students must develop and (re)acclimatize their ubiqui-
tous moral and ethical expertise relative to the ethos and
eidos of medicine.
This conception of ubiquitous moral (and ethical) exper-
tise should not be mistaken for reflex responses lacking in
creativity. In the first instance, our set of habitual or habitu-
ated moral responses provides the basis for our ethical reflec-
tions. Furthermore, such reflective practices are not free
from habit. Habit or moral disposition should not be seen as
the antithesis of our (ethical) autonomy, rather they are a pre-
condition freedom; they provide an essential basis for impro-
visation and creativity. (Dalton, 2004; Glveanu, 2012).8 We
should, then, think of medical professionals as having a par-
ticular habitus, something that should be seen to embody the
relevant ethos (Bourdieu, 1993).9 In using this term, there are
obvious and reasonably felicitous resonances with
Aristotelian moral philosophy. However, it is also a term that
has undergone significant development (Crossley, 2013)
both at the hands of Bourdieu and others. Furthermore, Zahle
(2013, 2014) makes use of the term in presenting her thesis
that normative states are directly perceptible, while Kukla
(2014) recently used it in her analysis of "common morality,"
what I would call ethos. Bourdieu (1992) defines habitus as
"a durable, transposable system of dispositions . . . principles
which generate and organize practices and representations"
(p. 53). Bourdieu, and practice theory more generally, seeks
to demonstrate how social life can appear to consist in rule
following but, in fact, nothing of the sort (Taylor, 1993). The
habitus and its dispositions are social structures and schemas
incarnated; they are the embodiment of tacit knowing and, in
interaction with the social environment, the principle of the
(re)production of practice(s).
One example of this is the (re)action of a General
Practitioner (GP) who conscientiously objects when faced with
a patient request for an abortion. Such GPs do not find them-
selves recapitulating the moral and ethical arguments about
abortion, conscientious objection, and referring patients who
make such request to non-objecting colleagues each time this
eventuality occurs. Having made a decision to contentiously
object, perhaps through (more or less) extended reflection and
analysis of the matter or perhaps simply through a commitment
to a (religious) authority or tradition, this is then put into prac-
tice, which is to say the individual who conscientiously objects
simply follows the relevant protocol or the practice(s) that has
been established for such cases.Again, I am not suggesting that
doctors behave as if they were automata. Such situations are
not devoid of a requirement to think, speak, and act. The
individual might, for example, need to explain their actions
to the patient or other members of staff, but such thinking,
speaking, and acting are comprised of what Schön (1984)
calls reflection-in-action. In this view, reflection can be con-
sidered a practice, an activity that is part of normal, everyday
and mundane course of medical practice. It is, therefore, a
product of habitus or, more accurately, the medical habitus of
medical professionals, as it interacts with the social context
(field). Needless to say, this is a context that includes others,
their (re)actions, and, therefore, practices required to support
intersubjective coordination.
As medicine or health care is a particular and relatively
autonomous sub-culture that is both of, but nevertheless dis-
tinct from, modern society, members or "natives" of this cul-
ture possess a ubiquitous moral and ethical expertise not
possessed by the population at large. Nevertheless, the abil-
ity of health care professionals to develop a ubiquitous moral
and ethical expertise relative to their field of practice is pred-
icated on an underlying moral and ethical expertise that is
relative to and ubiquitous in society at large. Of course, such
culturally relative moral and ethical expertise is not necessar-
ily right or good. The morality of various European cultures
in the early 20th century, including the medical culture of the
United Kingdom (Booth, 1994), was anti-Semitic, and thus,
many members of these cultures were "experts" in negotiat-
ing and reproducing a morally flawed society. Ubiquitous
moral expertise is normative in the sense that members are
required to conform to it, but that does not mean it is neces-
sary, right, good, or the best form for such expertise, some-
thing that is clearly troubling when considering a ubiquitous
moral and ethical expertise.
The Expertise of the Applied Ethicist
Although it is important to recognize that our moral function-
ing is predicated on the ubiquitous moral expertise of indi-
viduals going about their everyday lives, negotiating the ethos
of their social and cultural contexts, this perspective is a pre-
cursor or social and theoretical hinterland to my consideration
of ethical expertise. An expertise in applied or even practical
ethics is of a different order to this ubiquitous, everyday or
professional, moral expertise, even in its reflective guise.
Bioethics--the domain that applied ethics is most clearly
associated with--is a disciplinary practice with (inter)disci-
plinary (multiple methodological) standards. Furthermore,
although there might be an "ethos" or normative dimension to
the field,10 applied ethics is not itself the practice of morality.
Rather, bioethics is a theoretical practice, the theoretical prac-
tice of ethics certainly, but not, in itself, a moral practice.
Furthermore, it cannot be considered a moral practice of the
kind with which it is concerned. For example, applied ethics
often involves the analysis of the ethical problems of medical
practice, but it does not, itself, put those analyses or conclu-
sions into (professional) practice; individual ethicists have no
Emmerich 7
medical responsibility and, therefore, are not enmeshed in
the morality of medicine and health care more generally.
In thinking through the idea of ethical expertise, some
clarity can be found if we consider the distinction between
contributory and interactional expertise; concepts have been
recently developed in the context of conducting sociological
research into scientific practice (Collins & Evans, 2007). The
first specifies the kind of expertise it takes to contribute to a
discipline, to engage in the relevant practices, and to produce
the relevant products and outputs, while the second encapsu-
lates the fact that some individuals have a high degree of
knowledge such that while they are unable to engage in the
practices of a particular discipline, they are capable of dis-
cursively interacting with its practitioners at a high level.
Such interaction is fundamentally social and predominantly
linguistic; it involves discussing the discipline and its topics.
These are the kinds of discussion that occur during the more
social moments of disciplinary life--those that take place in
the lunch hour, at the conference (including, to a degree, pre-
sentations as well as during wine receptions), and in more
public domains, such as in the media or in "popular" science
books. The contemporary emergence of "science communi-
cation" and science communicators is an excellent example
of interactional expertise (Reich, 2012).
However, as Collins and Evans have recently made clear,
interactional expertise is not expertise in interacting. Rather,
"interactional expertise means grasping the conceptual struc-
ture of another's world" (Collins & Evans, 2014, p. 14, Note
3). Such expertise is, then, dependent on having some grasp
of their mode of social life and the ethos of their practices.
Thus, in attempting to place ones ethical expertise in the ser-
vice of another, we face challenges comparable with those
faced by anthropologist. First, is it possible to evaluate a cul-
ture if we are not, ourselves, members, and second, is it pos-
sible to do so ethically? The fact that, like applied ethics,
medical culture can be considered a sub-culture means that
such concerns are somewhat dampened, at least as compared
with their importance within anthropology. Nevertheless, the
point remains: If the commentaries and arguments of applied
(bio)ethicists are to guide the ethical structures of the medi-
cal profession and the actions of medical professionals, then
they must have a sense of its ethos. Such a sense is required
for them to properly grasp the conceptual structure of medi-
cal practice and, therefore, subject to it to a morally compre-
hensive analysis.
Contributory Expertise
An individual has a contributory expertise when he or she is
able to contribute to a discipline. We might suggest that, in
its strongest form, this means an ability to produce outputs
that signify a particular form of expertise. In the case of
applied ethics, this can be considered an ability to produce
articles that meet the relevant peer-review standard. However,
while this perspective is instructive, this is to focus on the
product of expertise rather than the expertise itself. Expertise
is what allows experts to produce such outputs. By way of an
example, consider Michelangelo's David. Michelangelo is,
we might say, an expert sculptor as evidenced by the statue
of David. However, Michelangelo's expertise in sculpting is
what produced David, it is not the statue of David itself.
Michelangelo's expertise was embedded within his practice
of sculpting, and thus, we must consider the practices that
bioethicists engage in. Contributory ethical expertise con-
sists in whatever ethical experts do to produce peer-reviewed
publications, the sine qua non of the disciplinary practice.
If we reflect further on the production of David, we might
think that, despite his supposed claims to the contrary,
Michelangelo did not simply set to work on a piece of marble
and reveal David. Similarly, no one simply sits down and
writes an article by conceiving an argument and writing it
down. The task of writing an article does not involve simply
starting with the introduction and working ones way toward
a conclusion. There is a great deal of preparation, of back and
forth, of wrong turns and dead ends, and, ultimately, of edit-
ing, rewriting, and polishing. We might think of the wider
practices involved in the production of academic publica-
tions. They are quite mundane and include reading articles;
thinking; reflecting on cases and thought experiments; pre-
senting ones work; talking with colleagues, students, and
others, including contributory experts, interactional experts,
and those who might have little more than a ubiquitous moral
and ethical expertise or who are undertaking to learn about
(bio)ethics; talking to those with other forms of relevant
expertise such as medical and health care professionals or
"expert" patients; and so on. All these tasks can and do con-
tribute to the process of developing an argument, and to reit-
erate, no ethicist simply sets out to write an academic article
with the entire argument in mind.
Thus, the process of writing is the process of crafting an
argument. The pen, the typewriter, the post-it note, the scrib-
bled in book, and the word processor are the tools of aca-
demic labor, and we do not use them to simply express our
thoughts but to develop them. We do not simply think and
then write, we think through writing (Shore, 1999). The arti-
cle is not the product of thought or of writing but of mutually
constitutive thinking and writing. The implicit conclusion is
that academic articles do not represent what the author
thinks, or, at least, they cannot be taken to represent what the
author thinks or thought at any one time. Rather, as with the
sculpture, articles are the final product of an extended, dia-
chronic, and complex process of thinking, writing, rethink-
ing, and rewriting. Articles and the ethical arguments
contained within them have been fashioned and not simply
expressed. An article is crafted, produced by a process that
involves a variety of tasks, all of them involving some form
of expert performance; some form of expertise.11
The conclusion one might draw is that any expertise is
embedded within processes and practices not simply within
individuals or products. Certainly, individual experts have a
8 SAGE Open
high level of knowledge and experience; one cannot simply
participate in a community of experts and expect to be able
to authentically reproduce (as opposed to merely emulate,
imitate, or copy) the expert practices that define a commu-
nity. Nevertheless, it is through a process of emulation and
imitation--or, one might say, through a process of "appren-
ticeship"--that the expert is created. Even in the case of
those expert practices that are most clearly based on a large
degree of technical and factual knowledge, such as medical
practice, it is what the individual can do with their knowl-
edge, the ways in which they can put that knowledge into
practice, which makes them a contributory expert. Just as the
medical student becomes a medical professional through a
process of socialization (and enculturation), the bioethicist is
similarly reproduced. Perhaps because it is primarily cogni-
tive in character, or perhaps because it lacks a clearly defined
and concrete `field of practice,' the idea that becoming an
expert ethicist is an essentially "social" process has been
neglected almost entirely. Thus whilst the fact that applied
ethicists undergo a process of socialization of is much less
obvious than it is in the case of, say, medical doctors (cf.
Hafferty & Franks, 1994). However, it is clearer that the
reproduction of expert ethicits is essentially cultural
(Bourdieu, 1990). The task facing the nascent ethicist is to
gain entry to a (very) particular cultural institution, the acad-
emy and, furthermore, one of its sub-domains--a particular
(inter)discipline.12 The task of becoming a contributory
expert in applied ethics is, therefore, more obviously a pro-
cess of enculturation. Such statements do not undermine the
academic seriousness of a discipline, its methodological (or
epistemological) rigor, or the relevance of and commitment
to various academic and scientific (in the continental sense
of the term) values, such as objectivity, to the practice of eth-
ics. It does not undermine the nature of bioethics any more
than it would were we to note the same about expert ballet
dancers, physicists, health care professionals, or sculptors. It
is simply to note that what is involved in the development of
a methodologically disciplined and contributory expertise in
ethics, or any other academic domain (such as medicine,
say), is to become an initiate, to become an accepted member
of a culture, or, better, to be initiated into a community of
practice (Lave, 1991; Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1999).
Interactional Expertise
The notion of interactional expertise names an individual
who is more or less fluent in the everyday discourse of con-
tributory expert. While contributory experts possess this
form of expertise, it can also be found in those who do not
have the requisite ability (or inclination) to contribute to
some discipline (Collins & Evans, 2007). As suggested,
interactional expertise does not involve being expert at social
interaction per se but, rather, involves "grasping the concep-
tual structure of another(s) world" (Collins & Evans, 2014,
p. 14, Note 3). In the case of morality and ethics, this notion
can be considered in a variety of ways. First, we might exam-
ine the connection and interaction between ethical expertise
and the ubiquitous moral expertise of the population at large.
Second, we might consider the interaction of expert ethicists
with medical and health care professionals both as expert
practitioners in the domain the bioethicists seek to comment
on and as having a distinct, (sub)culturally relative, form of
ubiquitous moral and ethical expertise. These complications
express a common concern in bioethics, namely, the relation-
ship between "common" (and medical) morality, on one
hand, and applied (bio)ethics (and moral philosophy), on the
other (Kukla, 2014).
In the terms I have been using, this is a concern for the
relationship between our everyday moral ethos, the ethos of
medicine and health care, and, ultimately, the ethos of applied
ethics (and moral philosophy). However, while the matter is
more complicated in the case of the relationship between
moral philosophy and "common morality," we might sup-
pose that the primary interaction between formal ethical
expertise and the practical moral expertise of health care pro-
fessionals can be located in the interaction between their
respective eidos, their ways of ethical thinking. This is some-
thing that is clearly related to the conceptual understanding
that structures their respective perspectives on morality and
ethics.
Given the relationship between applied ethics and ethics
in medical practice, we should be unsurprised to find that
there are a number of individuals who can be considered
contributory experts in both domains. There are many indi-
viduals who contribute to the discipline of applied ethics
while also having the requisite expertise to engage in (or
contribute to) medical practice. Such individuals possess
more than the ubiquitous moral and ethical expertise that
pertains to medicine and, literally, are an embodiment of
interactional ethical expertise as well as the interaction
between bioethics and medicine, or health care, more gener-
ally. Since its inception, bioethics has been conceived of as a
practical endeavor; one of its central aims is to contribute to
the moral and ethical practices of others, particularly health
care professionals. Applied ethics has been part of the field,
and a significant part of it aims to be practical. We might take
this as indicating that an interactional expertise is a central
aspect of bioethical expertise itself. This is because bioethics
seeks to influence and engage with domains beyond its aca-
demic and disciplinary borders. To do so, the requisite inter-
actional expertise must be acquired, something we might
think of as acquired independently from the development of
a contributory bioethical expertise, but nevertheless as fall-
ing squarely within the central tasks of bioethics and applied
ethics.
This point is not a simple one. All disciplinary experts
must possess some degree of interactional expertise if they
are to engage in the social and cultural practices that sur-
round and constitute some of the practices, such as teaching,
that are required to be a contributory expert. However, if
Emmerich 9
ethical experts are to engage with those who exist outside of
applied ethics, they will have to develop an interactional
expertise that pertains to domains other than their own and
allow this to become an aspect of their own contributory
expertise. In the context of science journalism, Reich (2012)
discussed a similar idea, suggesting expert journalists pos-
sess a "bipolar" interactional expertise that is constitutive of
journalism and, therefore, of their own contributory exper-
tise. Thus, their interactional expertise is "bipolar" because
journalists are expert at interacting with both academic
sources and in communicating with the public or lay audi-
ences; they are expert at taking information from one context
and "translating" it into another. This is an ability that
requires them to have interactional expertise in two, if not
more, domains. However, in the case of ethical expertise,
such interaction poses a challenge as what is on offer is not
only normative but normative in two senses. It is not only
directive in the sense of being substantively action-guiding
but in the sense of being methodologically prescriptive--it
does not just suggest what decisions should be taken but how
those decisions should be taken. What applied ethics has to
offer is not restricted to substantive ethical arguments and
positions but particular ethical concepts and modes of think-
ing. The disciplinary nature of applied ethics is such that it
suggests that ethics ought to be done from its particular per-
spective, from within its particular ethos (and associated
eidos), and not from the perspective of, say, medical moral-
ity. Nevertheless, no more than they can expect their substan-
tive ethical conclusions to be taken at face-value, ethical
experts cannot expect methodological compliance to simply
be forthcoming. Only through bringing competing ethical
frameworks, moral perspectives, and conceptual structures
into dialogue and debate can ethical experts expect to make
positive (and ethical) contribution to the broader ethical dis-
courses of the medical professional and the practices of
health care more generally.
In this context, we might consider the role of the "consul-
tant" or "clinical" (bio)ethicist, as found in many American
hospitals. Such individuals may not be contributory experts in
medical practice, applied ethics, or any other bioethical domain.
However, we might consider them as possessing a high level of
interactional expertise with applied ethics, practical ethics, and
bioethics more generally, as well as the cultural domains of
medicine and health care. Similar to Reich's analysis of science
journalism, we might consider the consultant bioethicist to
have a bipolar interactional expertise; they can negotiate the
respective ethos of bioethics and medicine so as to relate their
(not unrelated) conceptual ethical structures or eidos. For the
most part, they can be considered as "translators" of an "aca-
demic worldview" such as that of applied ethics--of its per-
spectives, methodology, principles, arguments, judgments, and
justifications--in such a way that they become more relevant,
comprehensible, and aesthetically "palatable" to clinicians,
health care professionals, and patients.This is primarily accom-
plished through an engagement with clinicians, health care
professionals, and patients ideally on their own terms, that is,
in such a way as to be consistent with the ethos and eidos of
health care and to accord with the patient's particular under-
standing and perspective. The contributory expertise of such
consultant bioethicists is a "bipolar" interactional expertise,
the ability to bring the conceptual structures of a particular
form(s) of academic practice into dialogue with the more
immediate and practical context of medical practice and its
ethos.
If we return to consider the applied (bio)ethicist while we
might suggest that they must also have some degree of inter-
actional expertise with medicine and health care, at least to
the degree that they can understand "the medical case,"13
they may never direct experience or negotiate the moral
world of a particular hospital or a particular medical ethical
dilemma. However, if they are to be successful in their
attempts to intellectually engage with the medical and health
care professional, they must interact with medical morality;
they must have some interactional grasp of the ethos and, in
particular, the eidos of medicine, with the conceptual struc-
ture of its reflective ethical practices. However, the gap
between the intellectual interaction and practical experience
remains. Collins and Evans's (2007) conceptualization of the
difference between polimorphic and mimeomorphic actions
can be used to capture this point. Such activities are, respec-
tively, social and representational and, therefore, correlated
with our practical and reflective abilities. Polimorphic activi-
ties are inescapably bound up in thick social and cultural
contexts. In contrast, mimeomorphic actions are such that
they can be (re)presented as asocial or acultural.14 One of the
best examples of this is the difference between simply riding
a bike (or bike-balancing) and riding a bike across a city.
Engineers can model the former such that they can construct
a machine that can accomplish the same task. The latter
necessitates social and cultural interactions between the
rider, the environment, other road users, and pedestrians. It,
therefore, necessitates thick social, cultural, and intersubjec-
tive understanding that is beyond the capabilities of any mere
machine.15
Medical practice and, therefore, the ethical issues that
arise within it take place in a polimorphic context. However,
these same ethical issues are given what we might call a
mimeomorphic representation within bioethics and, in par-
ticular, applied ethics.16 This idea requires a good deal more
examination than the account I can offer here. However, it is
sufficient to point out that when ethical issues arise in prac-
tice, they involve specific patients, particular doctors, and
health care professionals, all of whom are socially, culturally,
and historically situated and stand in particular relationships
to one another. The eidos of applied ethics is to eliminate or
ignore this context, perceiving it to be extraneous to ethical
analysis. Consequentially, the "cases" of medical ethics are
often populated by roles rather than individuals and by those
assigned a generalized "personhood," or moral status, rather
than by people considered as concrete individuals.
10 SAGE Open
The underlying conception of the ethical subject of
applied ethics, and related approaches to ethical analysis, is
that of the Cartesian rational actor. Consider, for example,
Rawls's (1999) veil of ignorance or the debate about "per-
sonhood" (Tooley, 2010). This approach is taken further by
many paradigmatic examples that form the foundations of
bioethics and bioethical thinking, that is, its eidos. Consider
James Rachels's (1975) "Bathtub Case" as an attempt to rep-
resent the distinction between killing and letting die and
active and passive euthanasia. Alternatively, consider the
argument Thomson (1971) presents with regard to "The
Violinist" and the way it purports to encapsulate the ethical
issues that surround abortion. Finally, consider the way organ
markets are justified, the demonstrative and experimental
purpose of Trolley Dilemmas, and the various ways in which
individuals can be morally dumbfounded (Erin & Harris,
2003; Haidt et al., 2000; Thomson, 1985). All involve
mimeomorphic representations of ethical "reality," they are
all constructed for the purposes of illuminating our ethical
intuitions and (at best) their interplay with our ethical reason-
ing in producing ethical judgments.
Such cases seek to starkly represent those factors consid-
ered to be ethically relevant while preventing any other fac-
tor from being an obstacle to our understanding. As such,
they require us to respond in a certain way, from within a
certain ethos, namely, a mimeomorphic one. It is against the
rules of the game to introduce polimorphic social life into the
examples by, say, insisting on the gendered nature of the ethi-
cal subject hidden behind the veil of ignorance, wondering
about the character of a person who would not kill his nephew
but would "merely" let him die, questioning the social differ-
ences between a violinist attached to an individual and a
fetus growing within a woman's womb, pointing out that no
market can be mimeomorphic in practice, suggesting that no
one who encountered the trolley dilemma in "real life" could
ever be entirely sure the fat man would dislodge the carriage,
or taking the view that no one could truly be sure that the
siblings would not experience negative emotional conse-
quences after having sex with each other. When actually
encountered, all ethical dilemmas are polimorphic; they
involve real people, with real histories and relationships,
with open and uncertain futures. This is not to say that repre-
senting ethical dilemmas mimeomorphically is flawed or has
nothing to contribute to the ethical issues embedded within
concrete polimorphic practices. Clearly, they do. However, it
is to say that the way in which bioethical analysis seeks to
"encounter" ethical dilemmas is different from the way they
are, in fact, encountered. The practices of applied ethics are
not the sum total of ethics, let alone moral practice.
In representing ethical cases, applied philosophical bio-
ethics strips out the moral ethos of medicine focusing on the
eidos as a way to fully concentrate on "the ethical." One
result is that we can distinguish between the ubiquitous
moral and ethical expertise of health care professionals from
the contributory expertise embodied by the "practical" or
applied philosophical (bio)ethicist. Nevertheless, the various
forms of expertise, and the individuals who possess them,
necessarily meet and interact, giving rise to various forms of
interactional expertises that inform both the ubiquitous poli-
morphic (interactional, affective, and cognitive) moral and
ethical expertise of health care professionals and the mimeo-
morphic (reflective and predominantly cognitive) ethical
expertise of the bioethicist.
Conclusion
In the context of psychiatry, Brodwin (2008) argued that
medical morality and bioethics are co-productive.17 This
view gives further color to Toulmin's (1982) claim that med-
icine saved the life of ethics and, I think, holds true across the
medical specialties and health care professions more gener-
ally. There is a reflexive and mutually supportive relation-
ship between the ethical eidos of modern medicine and
"applied ethics" or (normative) bioethics. From a historical
point of view, one might suggest that in the late 1960s, eth-
ics--in the broad sense of theology, law, and philosophy--
was fused with medicine and subsequent developments, not
least an increasing secularization of the medicine and the
public sphere, and gave further impetus to practical, norma-
tive, and applied (bio)ethics. This phenomenon has contin-
ued to develop and mutate since that time, reflexively
influencing several of its source disciplines and wider soci-
ety as a whole. So successful was this fusion that bioethics
can rightly be called a cultural phenomenon and one that has
influenced not only its culture of origin, American medicine,
but also American and other (trans)national cultures as a
whole (Wilson, 2014). Bioethics has also given rise to vari-
ous forms of contributory and interactional expertise and
fundamentally altered the ubiquitous moral and ethical
expertise of health care professionals by fundamentally alter-
ing the conceptual structure of health care practice, which is
to say by significantly affecting its culture.
Through distinguishing different forms of moral and ethi-
cal expertise, we can renew our appreciation for the connec-
tion between applied (bio)ethics and forms of common
morality, particularly medical morality. The analysis of ethi-
cal problems offered by applied ethicists are mimeomorphic
(re)constructions of those encountered in practice. In so
doing, the thick polimorphic social reality or ethos in which
those problems are embedded is neglected. Thus, there is a
qualitative difference between encountering (and thinking
about) an ethical problem in practice, conducting an aca-
demic analysis and the respective expertise required for each
task. On this ground, we can differentiate between the moral
responsibilities of health care professionals and the scope of
the ethical authority of the expert ethicist. The expert analy-
sis offered by ethicists has limited scope and, therefore, can-
not authoritatively determine the ethics of acting within a
thick moral context. This being the case, there is a space
within which we can maintain the moral and ethical authority
Emmerich 11
of the individual actor while acknowledging the ways in
which ethics offers expert analysis and, ideally, a form of
dialogical engagement rooted in an interactional form of
ethical (and moral) expertise.
This view indicates that "applied ethics" is not and cannot
be the sum total of "ethics" or ethical practice. It can often
seem that applied ethics is positioned as the way to do ethics.
However, pace Narvaez and Lapsley's (2005) critique of
phenomenalism, it is erroneous to view only those actions
undertaken reflectively as "moral" or "ethical." The view I
have presented here encourages recognition of our "mun-
dane" and "everyday" moral and ethical practices, practices
that exhibit varying levels of intuition as well as reflection.
In my view, such activities are best understood as being dis-
positional, a function of habitus, and, therefore, as intimately
related to the social, cultural, and structural conditions that
produced the relevant dispositions and habitus (Emmerich,
2013). Bioethics and, indeed, applied ethics is a central part
of the social, cultural, and structural conditions within which
the professional practices of contemporary health care takes
place. Thus, we must seek to understand the relationship
between the moral practices of health care and the expertise
of bioethics in cultural and social theoretical terms. The con-
ceptual foundation developed above offers one way in which
we might do so.
Furthermore, expert ethicists and bioethicists must seek a
similar understanding of the way in which they contribute to
the moral and ethical dimensions of medicine and health
care. The academic literature is not the entirety of this con-
tribution. Ethicists can, do, and should interact with medical
and health care professionals in a variety of fora including
conferences, committees, and via process that can and do
(re)form professional and institutional guidelines. Such fora
are, however, not opportunities for professionals to be
turned into (applied) ethicists or to be shown how to do eth-
ics "properly." We must abandon the idea that professionals
simply ought to make ethical decisions in a manner that imi-
tates the arguments contained in academic articles or,
indeed, the methodology of applied ethics. This idea must
be abandoned because it is not the case that health care pro-
fessionals can make decisions in this way. Even if, thanks to
bioethics, we consider the respective ethical eidos of medi-
cine and applied ethics to be related, their respective ethos
differs significantly. Finally, while interactional expertise is
not an expertise in interacting, social interaction is vital if
interactional expertise is to be realized, exercised, and exer-
cised well. If academic (bio)ethics is to engage with medi-
cine (and vice versa) to the fullest degree possible, then the
development of an expertise in interacting, in bringing these
two worlds and their conceptual structures together in a par-
ticular discursive context, and in a practical, mutually
enlightening manner has a lot to recommend it. I imagine
this is an important facet in the success, or otherwise, of
bioethics consultations and, in my experience, of clinical
ethics committees.
To be clear, such experts and practices exist. However, the
methodological conceits of applied ethics have, thus far, con-
strained our understanding of the nature of such endeavors.
Medical and health care professionals are not, and cannot be,
expert applied ethicists. However, by bringing the expertise
of applied ethicists and health care professionals into dia-
logue, which is to say interaction, there is opportunity for
mutually enlightening experiences and for expert (bio)ethi-
cists to properly contribute to the moral and ethical recon-
struction of health care.
Notes
 1. Rather than suggesting ethics or Moralität is eidos, it would
be more accurate to say that eidos represents the socio-logic of
Moralität or ethics--a point I make in more detail below.
2. While a fuller account of ethos and eidos is needed, they
must be articulated and defended on their own terms, consis-
tent with the intellectual and theoretical practice of sociology
and anthropology; this must proceed hand in hand with their
deployment in concrete attempts at socio-analysis. My use of
them here is as part of one such project.
 3. As Doris and Nichols (2012) have pointed out, the cognitive
sciences, moral psychology, and, one might add, empirical
ethics uncritically adopt the asocial individualism that is the
prevailing assumption of modern moral philosophy. The thesis
presented here is consistent with their recommendation that
the role of human sociality in morality and ethics, and the col-
laborative nature of reason, ought to be more fully explored.
 4. The term socio-logic or sociological is used to emphasize the
way in which eidos refers to the logic of practice rather than
what Bourdieu (1992) calls the logic of the logician. It refers
to the normative sociological order--or ethos--within which
practices, including the practices of thought, are organized or
structured. The eidos is not thought itself, but the embodied
and tacit dimensions of thinking out with explicit reflection
cannot be considered to take place. Thus, computers do not
think or reflect; they calculate. See the distinction between
mimeomorphic and polimorphic drawn below.
 5. Bateson's, and therefore my, use of the term has almost nothing
to do with the phenomenological conception of eidos. One might
also add that it has little to do with the way Aristotle uses the
term. That said, there is a sense is which Bateson means eidos
to capture the essence of a culture, at least insofar as its logic or
"way of thinking" can be considered as part of this essence.
6. Narvaez and Lapsley (2005) discuss the "principle of phe-
nomenalism," the tendency of moral philosophy (and moral-
ized psychology), to define moral behavior as that motivated
by moral judgments, thereby ruling out automatic or intuitive
moral responses as being rightly categorized as "moral." They
argue for a "psychologized morality" and, therefore, adopt an
expanded conception of "the moral" similar to the one at play
in this article. In a not dissimilar manner, Abend (2013) argues
for the importance of an expanded conception of morality in
social studies of the phenomenon. My use of the term ethos
aims to fulfill a similar function. However, it is balanced by the
term eidos, which I use to maintain a focus on formal ethical
thinking as the phenomenon of particular interest in the study
of ethical expertise.

 7. If, as Anderson (2005) has suggested, contemporary academic
culture inhabits an "anti-ethos ethos" (p. 173), then we might
take applied philosophical (bio)ethics to be a particularly illu-
minating example. As such bioethics cannot be considered
as unproblematically objective--as "a-cultural" or "a-polit-
ical"--but, rather, inhabiting a complex culture of ethical
objectivity, that is, one where objectivity is understood to be
a cultural or disciplinary value, an aspect of its ethos. Such a
view is, I think, consistent with Miller's (2003) analysis of the
ethos of expertise as involving the transformation of ethos into
logos, a transformation that facilitates the denial of ethos.
 8. While the idea that habit is the antithesis of freedom or auton-
omy is widespread, it is, as a tranche of recent publications
have amply demonstrated, not only fundamentally mistaken
but in conflict with the concepts of history (Carlisle, 2014;
Lumsden, 2013; Ravaisson, 2008; Sparrow & Hutchinson,
2013).
 9. The idea that an ethos/habitus is a morality made flesh is con-
sistent with the broader conception of morality that I have
adopted here. It is also worth noting that in this passage,
Bourdieu also rejects the notion of eidos, something he previ-
ously drew upon in a manner similar to my own (and, there-
fore, Bateson's). However, it is a term he later readopts and
does so in a way that gives me confidence in the term as I use
it here (Bourdieu, 2000).
10. Consider, for example, Daston's (1995) analysis of "The Moral
Economy of Science" and how her perspective can inform our
understanding of any disciplinary practice, including bioeth-
ics and its various sub-practices such as applied philosophical
bioethics, feminist ethics, empirical ethics, and so on.
11. This point is consistent with the view that journal articles "are
not themselves examples of explicit knowledge. They are,
rather, the means by which explicit knowledge is transmit-
ted. They are like the germs which cause a disease rather than
being the disease itself" (Collins, 2013, p. 26).
12. We might distinguish between what is required of an (applied)
ethicist if they are to join a philosophy department and a
medical faculty. Nevertheless, the point reinforces the cultural
nature of the academy and the place of bioethics and bioethi-
cists within it.
13. Perhaps in a manner analyzed by Anspach (1988) whose per-
spective in this matter can be transferred to the medical ethi-
cal case as a kind of genre (Chambers, 1999, p. 3; Emmerich,
2013, pp. 31, 77; Emmerich, 2014, p. 11).
14. As Collins and Kusch (1999) point out, mimeomorphic
actions, activities, or, as I will be discussing, representations
may contain elements of culture. A bicycle is, obviously, a
cultural artifact. Nevertheless, bike riding (balancing) can be
represented mimeomorphically, and therefore, a machine can
be programmed to accomplish the task. Similarly, the philo-
sophical examples discussed below contain elements of cul-
ture, a bathtub, a violinist, a market, a trolley. Nevertheless,
these examples are all attempts to (re)present ethical dilemmas
mimeomorphically.
15. We need not make the claim that no machine could ever be con-
structed that could ride a bike across a city in traffic. Rather the
claim is that if we made such a machine, and it appears Google
has gone some way to doing so in the case of a self-driving
car, then it would accomplish the task in a mimeomorphic
manner. It would be completing the same activity but not the
same action. The introduction of such cars will alter the rules
of the road and may even make it impossible for human beings
to safely drive.
16. We might understand alternative approaches to ethical analy-
sis, such as feminist ethics, as attempts to develop and rein-
troduce a degree of polimorphicity to the mimeomorphic
representations created by and underlying the approach
adopted by applied philosophical bioethics.

in the United Kingdom, given in terms of a thought-collective
(Reubi, 2013).
