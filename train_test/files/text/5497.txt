After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, US forces made a star-
tling discovery: President Saddam Hussein had made
thousands of audio recordings of his private meetings and
telephone conversations with Iraqi officials (Rubin, 2011,
Woods and Stout, 2010). Saddam discussed his views of
the US, Israel, Iran and other national security issues in
transcripts now available to researchers. While Saddam
spoke extensively in public speeches during his decades
in power, there had few means by which to judge whether
these were merely manipulative communications ­ until
now.
Using automated content analysis, we compared
Saddam's public and private speech by looking for markers
of conflict, control and complexity as identified in well-
established coding schemes. We collected Saddam's public
speeches and interviews on international affairs from
1977­2000, which produced a data set of 330,000 words.
From the captured transcripts, we garner a set of private
text (58,000 words) to compare to this public corpus. We
thus provide the most empirically rich analysis of Saddam's
public belief system yet generated, and the first content
analysis-based account of his private beliefs.
First, we briefly explore the issue of public and private
political selves. Then, we explain our content analysis pro-
cedures and the corpus of Saddam's speech to which we
apply them. We give an analysis of Saddam's worldview in
public and private, with reference to general international
political life and to his great enemies: the US, Iran and
Israel. We end with thoughts on the implications of our
study.
Public and private beliefs
Politicians give many speeches and interviews that are
instantly available on the Internet, and desktop computers
can process them in innovative ways, transforming the
words into data (Laver et al., 2003; Schafer and Young,
1998). Researchers have taken advantage of this possibility
with multiple studies in which public speech is hypothe-
sized to be revelatory of political worldviews, which are in
turn hypothesized to shape the actions of important politi-
cal actors (Hermann, 2005; Suedfeld, 2010; Schafer and
Walker, 2006). A criticism of this approach is that public

Abstract
We ask if the public speech of political leaders is diagnostic of their private beliefs, and investigate through content analysis
of the rhetoric of Saddam Hussein, the former president of Iraq. We collected Saddam's public speeches and interviews
on international affairs from 1977­2000, producing a data set of 330,000 words. From transcripts of Saddam speaking
in private, we garnered a comparison corpus of 58,000 words. These text-sets were processed to locate markers of
conflict, control and complexity. We find that Saddam's hostile, conflict-oriented worldview and his perception of
himself as a significant political actor was consistent across public and private domains. The major difference between
these spheres was his more complex private view of international affairs compared to his more definitive public stance.
Our evidence supports the notion that private beliefs can be inferred from the public speech of political leaders.

speech is manipulative and strategic. Politicians say one
thing in public and another in private. If public presenta-
tions differ from private realities, and if private realities
drive behavior, then the value of analyzing public speech is
limited (Marfleet, 2000; Renshon, 2009).
The concern is especially apposite when dealing with
distinctive personalities at the apex of repressive regimes.
Leaders of rogue regimes are disproportionately involved
in conflict and disproportionately difficult to understand
(Londono, 2013). Closed regimes give us public speech,
but little information on private deliberations. The question
of whether we can believe what dictators say in public has
been a key problem in US foreign policy for many years.
For several decades it was Saddam Hussein of Iraq who
caused this question to be raised most urgently. The pro-
genitor of a rolling series of wars, Saddam harbored unclear
intentions derived from opaque motives (Duelfer and
Dyson, 2011). The closed nature of his regime revealed lit-
tle knowledge of his private reckoning. The world commu-
nity often had just the public face of the regime to use in
predicting likely behavior.
Psychology gives us two broad views on public versus
private beliefs: intra-situational consistency and impression
management (Tetlock and Manstead, 1985). If the intra-
situational consistency position is correct, then political
figures reveal their sincere beliefs in all contexts, and these
beliefs are stable across time, topic and audience. If the
impression management hypothesis is accurate, speech is
calibrated to achieve some strategic end. Revealed beliefs
of the political figure will vary across time, topic, and audi-
ence (Goffman, 1959; Snyder, 1987). These are ideal types,
with the reality probably somewhere in between. Whether
public speech reveals private beliefs is ultimately an empir-
ical question.
The question is hard to test, though. Politicians speak a
lot in public, but we have few records of their private
speech. Adolf Hitler had his dinnertime conversations,
which ranged across politics, history, and the arts, tran-
scribed by aides during the period 1941­1944 (Trevor-
Roper, 1953). John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson had
taping systems installed in the White House and the tran-
scripts of these recordings provide valuable insights into
Kennedy's deliberations during the Cuban Missile Crisis
(May and Zelikow, 2002; Renshon, 2009) and Johnson's
methods of persuasion (Beschloss, 1998). Infamously,
Richard M Nixon kept tapes that showed his involvement
in the cover-up of the break-in at the Watergate complex
(Kutler, 1998). His national security advisor, Henry
Kissinger, recorded his telephone calls as he practiced
high-level personal diplomacy (Burr, 1999).
Following the Nixon catastrophe few Western politi-
cians have, to our knowledge, thought it wise to install
taping systems. The Iraqi president from 1977­2003 had
no such inhibitions. After the collapse of the Saddam
regime, US forces discovered a vast trove of recordings
and transcripts. Archivists translated, transcribed, and cat-
egorized the recordings (Woods et al., 2011).
Approximately 2,300 separate tapes feature Saddam as a
primary participant, and most of these are records of
Revolutionary Command Council, Council of Ministers
or ad hoc National Security group meetings. Whilst the
tapes cover the vast majority of the years Saddam held
office, the distribution is uneven, with ­ unfortunately ­
very few in 2002­2003 as the regime prepared for its final
confrontation with the US.
Why would a leader as paranoid and secretive as Saddam
make the tapes? It was important to him to have records of
what his ministers had promised. In the highly centralized
Ba'ath system Saddam and his closest aides made decisions
on an extremely wide range of topics and he wanted some
way to keep track of their discussions. In January 1981
Saddam was at the end of a particularly frustrating series of
telephone calls with his general staff, and became exasper-
ated at the confusion. `From now on let us record all tele-
phone calls', he ordered (Woods et al., 2011: 7). On the
tapes, Saddam speaks candidly on sensitive subjects ­ he
did not expect the records to become publicly available
(Woods et al., 2011: 8).
The captured tapes have been exploited in a fascinating
series of qualitative studies, investigating Saddam's private
deliberations on nuclear weapons (Brands and Palkki,
2011), his strategy in the first Gulf War (Woods, 2008), his
strategic view of the United States (Brands and Palkki,
2012) and his conduct of internal Iraqi affairs (Sassoon,
2012).
Some initial conclusions have been offered on the pub-
lic/private question. David Palkki, acting director at the
Conflict Records Research Center in Washington DC,
which holds the Saddam tapes, finds that `when it came to
his worldview, what Saddam said in public was very simi-
lar to what he said in private. Although Americans often
discount what dictators say in public, Saddam was gener-
ally sincere in his public rhetoric' (Palkki, 2011: see also
Brands 2011a, 2011b). This is an impression that we test
systematically in this paper.
Private text
Our main source of private text is the volume The Saddam
Tapes, containing more than 300 pages of transcripts of
meetings where Saddam was a primary participant. The
editors of the volume cut some passages from the published
transcripts: `In theory, the less excised from a transcript, the
better the reader can understand the context of the conver-
sation. In practice, many of the translations contain ram-
bling, tangential discussions or otherwise distracting and
relatively unimportant material' (Woods et al., 2011: xi).
The editors selected transcripts that related to major
national security matters; in particular, the US, Israel, the
Iran­Iraq war, the first Persian Gulf War and the sanctions
Dyson and Raleigh 3
regime of the United Nations. These sampling decisions are
consistent with our research aims.
To supplement this material, one of the present authors
made a research visit to the Conflict Records Research
Center, at the National Defense University, to work with
the full volume of records. Additional material featuring
Saddam speaking on topics of interest was collected. We
rendered all of this material into electronic form and thereby
constructed a database of Saddam's private speech, totaling
58,000 words.
Public text
We constructed a corpus of 330,000 words spoken in public
by Saddam from 1977­2000 on international relations and
security topics. The major source for this text was the
Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), maintained
by the US State Department as, essentially, a pre-internet
method of monitoring foreign news services. FBIS carried
major addresses and interviews given by Saddam until its
discontinuation in 1995. It is archived on micro-fiche in
most university libraries. We supplemented the FBIS mate-
rial with speeches collected from internet archival sources
from 1995­2000, thus matching the time period covered by
the private text.
Content analysis procedures
We applied a quantitative content analysis to Saddam's
public and private speech. The underlying assumption was
that the words people speak are related to the thoughts they
have, and the thoughts they have are related to how they
behave (Suedfeld et al., 2005: 246). We used variables
derived from two content analysis schemes: the `Leadership
Trait Analysis' approach developed by Margaret G
Hermann (Hermann, 2005) and the `Verbs in Context
System'for operational code analysis developed by Stephen
G Walker and Mark Schafer (Schafer and Walker, 2006).
Both schemes have been automated for use with the content
analysis software engine Profiler Plus.1 Automated coding
removes the possibility of human variability in coding deci-
sions and so eliminates inter-rater reliability concerns.
Variables
We used four variables that capture key elements of a polit-
ical figure's worldview. These beliefs and personality traits
have proven especially fecund in previous analyses and
bear upon central issues of an actor's strategic approach to
international politics.
Image of other is a variable from the operational code
scheme (termed the first philosophical belief in that research
program). The focus is the hostility or friendliness of both
political life in general and of specific actors within the
political universe. The variable represents the optimism or
pessimism of the agent about their environment, and has
been likened to the idealism/realism split in international
relations theory (George, 1969; Walker and Schafer, 2007).
Scores on this variable are created by coding verbs in the
agent's speech referring to actions taken by others as either
hostile and threatening, or friendly and cooperative.
Calculating the balance between the types of verbs pro-
duces a scale where lower scores indicate a more hostile
view of the other.
Image of self, also drawn from the operational code
scheme (termed the first instrumental belief), is the coun-
terpoint to image of other, and measures whether the agent
sees their own behavior as hostile or cooperative. The focus
is on verbs describing actions taken by the individual and
their state and, again, lower scores indicate more hostile
dispositions.
Belief in ability to control events represents the degree
to which the leader under evaluation sees themself and
the state they lead as an influential actor in world politics.
Leaders who score higher on this measure see the world
as more malleable and so tend to discount barriers to the
achievement of goals. They have been found to prefer
proactive policies in service of ambitious goals (Dyson,
2006). Leaders who score lower perceive material, his-
torical and social forces as determinate. These individu-
als tend to be reactive and risk averse. The belief in
ability to control events score is created by identifying
verbs in the individual's speech related to action taken by
the leader or their state as a percentage of the total verbs
in a text sample. Higher scores indicate greater percep-
tion of control.
Conceptual complexity refers to the sophistication of a
leader's cognitive architecture (Suedfeld, 1992). Individuals
higher in complexity have a differentiated view of the
world, with multiple schemata at different levels of gener-
ality that are integrated into a complex information pro-
cessing system. These individuals prefer inductive
information processing, tend to require more information
prior to making a decision, and often revisit previous deci-
sions and the premises upon which they were made.
Individuals who score lower on this measure, in contrast,
tend toward more definitive, black-and-white cognitive
styles. These leaders rely heavily on a few core beliefs and
principles at a high level of generality and process incom-
ing information deductively, selectively perceiving or mod-
ifying new information so that it remains consistent with
their existing cognitive predispositions. Lower complexity
leaders have a tendency to divide the outside world into
relatively straightforward categories ­ such as friend and
enemy, good and evil ­ and rarely revisit past decisions
(Hermann, 2005; Preston, 2001). The coding engine tags
words related to higher complexity (i.e., approximately,
possibility, trend) and low complexity (absolutely, cer-
tainly, definitely) and reports the balance. Higher scores
indicate more complex worldviews.
4 Research and Politics 
Results
For ease of interpretation, we normalized Saddam's scores to
a separately constructed reference group of world political
leaders with a mean of 0.50 and a standard deviation of 0.10,
and plotted the results graphically, as shown in Figures 1­4
(see Appendix for raw scores for Saddam and reference
group).2 Examining Saddam's overall worldview (all material
on all topics coded), we see congruence between private and
public beliefs on each element other than conceptual com-
plexity (see Figure 1). Saddam held a resolutely hostile image
of the political universe (image of other) and a preference for
non-cooperative strategies (image of self). He exhibited pub-
lic confidence in his ability to shape events, and this was even
more pronounced in private. He exhibited higher complexity
in private than in public, crossing the boundary between low
and high as established by the world leader reference group.
We separated material where Saddam was speaking
about his three great enemies, the US (Figure 2), Iran
(Figure 3) and Israel (Figure 4). His beliefs about these
states are strikingly similar to his overall worldview: hos-
tile images of self and other, high perceptions of control,
and variable levels of complexity. There are, however,
some notable differences. Saddam's most hostile beliefs
concern Israel, and he privately perceived lower ability to
influence their actions, whilst expressing a greater per-
ceived control in public ­ perhaps evidence of an impres-
sion management strategy.
Saddam's beliefs concerning the United States are par-
ticularly interesting. He described the US as more hostile
when speaking in public than when discussing policy in
private (image of other). Conversely, he portrayed Iraq's
actions in public as less conflict-oriented than when strate-
gizing privately (image of self). Saddam displayed a higher
level of conceptual complexity when speaking about the
United States to colleagues in private settings, and talked
about the US in more definitive terms in public. Other than
complexity, though, these are differences of degree rather

than kind: Saddam maintained hostile views of the US in
both public and private (see Brands and Palkki, 2012, for a
detailed discussion of Saddam's view of the US).
Inferring private beliefs from public
speech
These data give us two ways to summarize the public/pri-
vate congruence in Saddam's worldview. First, does
Saddam's placement relative to the reference group vary
depending upon the setting of his comments? For example,
if he scores as having a hostile worldview in public, do his
private comments reveal similar hostility? Second, how
great is the quantitative distance between his public and pri-
vate scores, regardless of `high' or `low' categorizations?
Considering the four elements of Saddam's worldview
across the four readings of it (overall, US, Iran and Israel)
gives us sixteen comparisons of public/private beliefs. In
thirteen of the sixteen public/private dyads, Saddam's rela-
tionship to the reference group mean (above or below) is
consistent from public to private. In terms of quantitative
distance between the public and private scores, thirteen of
the sixteen dyads maintain a one standard deviation or less
distance.3
In the case of Saddam, then, we see a similar political
actor in public and private most of the time. Researchers
armed with content analysis technologies now have some
evidence showing that beliefs revealed publicly match
those concealed privately (see also Renshon, 2009).
Saddam is revealed as showing broad intrapsychic con-
sistency ­ he was largely the same political actor speaking
in private to his colleagues as in public before a crowd.4
Some evidence of impression management is apparent,
perhaps for political advantage or as an artifact of the

different audience setting. Saddam's higher complexity
when speaking in private is the prime example of this in
our study.
Of course, impression management may take place both
in front of a crowd and behind closed doors: Saddam may
have been performing for his advisers in private and for a
crowd in public. This would suggest that a third set of data,
perhaps diary entries or similarly intimate materials, would
be needed to capture the `true' private Saddam. This is a
question of how we define `private'. Our argument is that
we see Saddam displaying broadly the same political
worldview in public rhetorical and private policy making
settings, with the exceptions noted above.
Comparing public and private worldviews is not, of
course, the same as being able to predict the actions of
political leaders. These are baseline propensities Saddam
exhibited when thinking about the world, and diagnosing
a worldview is far from foreseeing an action on a spe-
cific date directed at a specific target. Worldviews of
political actors interact with an array of other factors
both internal and external to the state in producing
action. One can, for example, hold a hostile belief toward
a state but have no intention of acting upon it, for pru-
dential reasons.
We need additional investigations focused upon the
small population of political actors for whom we have tran-
scripts of private deliberations: Hitler, Kennedy, Johnson,
Nixon and Kissinger. We believe that students investigating
how politicians seek to shape public opinion will find much
to mull over in the findings that public speech is sincere and
predictive of private beliefs rather than manipulative in
nature. Finally, we hope that more leaders in both demo-
cratic and authoritarian political systems follow Saddam's
example of recording their deliberations for posterity so
that we can continue to judge the sincerity of political lead-
ers when they speak in public.

2. The charts (Figures 1­4) show the four elements of world-
view along the horizontal axis, and the scores on each trait
along the vertical axis. The score for each dimension of
worldview generated from public text is represented by a
diamond, the score from private text by a circle. The hor-
izontal line is the reference group mean, so scores above
(below) the line are higher (lower) than this mean. The vari-
ables and their measures are of course separate from one
another, so the charts show four columns in one chart (one
for each element of worldview) rather than a scatterplot
where a trend line can be drawn horizontally to connect the
data points.
3. On these criteria, then, Saddam's public beliefs matched
his private beliefs on 26/32 (or about 80%) of the measured
chances to do so. Readers may wish to apply a different
standard of congruence, or to compare Saddam's beliefs to
a different reference group or particular political leader. To
facilitate this, we have included the raw trait scores in a sum-
mary table contained in an appendix to this article.
4. Saddam, though, was a member of several sub-categories
of political leader, including dictators and very possibly
persons with diagnosable mental pathologies. This is to say
that more such analyses are necessary before reaching firm
conclusions on the degree to which public speech reveals
private beliefs.

NOTE: Entries in Saddam cells are raw score/z-score. Word counts for the country files do not sum to the word counts for the `total' files because
Saddam spoke about international topics other than the US, Iran and Israel in material included in the `total' files. Data on 110 world political leaders
in the first column were provided by Social Science Automation. The cells in this column show mean/standard deviation.
