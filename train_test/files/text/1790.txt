Abstract
Objective: This study assessed the associations between obesity and dental
caries in young children participating in a national survey. Methods: Participants
included 1,507 children aged 2-6 years who received dental examinations and had
at least 10 primary teeth in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
1999-2002. Decayed/filled teeth (dft) counts of primary dentition were obtained, and
weight and height were measured. Body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was calculated,
and participants were categorized using age- and gender-specific criteria as under-
weight (<5th percent), normal (5th-85th percent), at risk for overweight (>85th and
<95th percent), and overweight (95th percent). With appropriate sample weighting,
relationships between dft and BMI were assessed using the Kruskal­Wallis test and
multivariable logistic regression. Results: Seventy-four percent of children were
classified as normal weight, 11 percent as at risk for overweight, and 11 percent as
overweight; 58 percent did not have caries; 30 percent had 1-5 dft and 12 percent
had >5 dft. When caries experience was compared across BMI categories stratified
by age and race characteristics, statistically significant association between caries
and obesity was found only for 60- <72-month age group. In the comparison between
children with normal and at-risk BMI only, significant associations were also found in
the Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black strata. In multivariable logistic regression
models to predict caries experience, family income and age were statistically sig-
nificant predictors for severe early childhood caries only. Conclusions: There
appears to be no significant association between childhood obesity and caries
experience after controlling for age, race, and poverty/income ratio. However, further
studies are needed to better understand this relationship.

Introduction
Although the prevalence of dental
caries has declined in the past
several decades, it continues to be a
significant public health problem
among children in the United States
(1). In particular, racial and ethnic
minority children and children living
in poverty have a disproportionately
higher burden of dental caries (2).
Dental caries is the most common
chronic childhood disease--in some
age groups it is five times more
prevalent than asthma (1). Early
childhood caries, which affects pri-
mary teeth during early stages of
life, can have a profound impact on a
child's oral and general health, and
quality of life. Twenty-eight percent
of the children in the United States
aged 2-6 years old have caries, and
the prevalence increased by 15
percent during the past decade (3).
Among the children with caries,
three-quarters of tooth decay remain
untreated (3).
Childhood obesity is currently the
most prevalent nutritional condition
of children in the U.S and is increas-
ingly being cited as a growing epi-
demic and public health crisis (4,5).
One study estimated that 25 percent
of 10-year-old children were at risk
for overweight and 11 percent were
obese. Nationally, the proportion of
overweight children aged 6-11 years
has more than doubled, and the
rate for overweight adolescents has
tripled since 1980 (5).
There has been a growing interest
in the relationship between dental
caries and childhood obesity. Some
studies have identified a positive
association between these two
common childhood conditions and
have suggested that obese children
are at an increased risk for dental
caries (6,7). Other studies, however,
have reported a negative association
based on the failure to thrive among
children with early childhood caries
and the corresponding lower body
mass index (BMI) (8,9). Additional
studies have also reported no asso-
ciation between dental caries and
childhood obesity (10,11). A recent
systematic review of the literature
published between 1984 and 2004
found only one study with a sufficient
level of evidence for direct associa-
tion between obesity and dental
caries (12). The association between
dental caries and obesity is compli-
cated because both are complex con-
ditions with multiple contributing
factors, including biological, genetic,
socioeconomic, cultural, dietary,

Nevertheless, childhood obesity and
caries may share some common risk
factors. For example, children at the
highest risk for dental caries are dis-
proportionately from minority house-
holds and/or live in poverty (1), and
childhood obesity is also associated
with low socioeconomic status (SES)
in the United States (13).
Since very few studies have
explored this issue using large-scale
national samples, the aim of our
study was to assess the associations
between obesity and dental caries in
children aged 2-6 years (24 to <72
months) who participated in the
National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002.
Methods
Data from NHANES 1999-2002
were used for this cross-sectional
study. The survey, which entailed
interviews and physical and labora-
tory examinations, is based on a
nationally representative sample of
approximately 5,000 persons each
year from 1999 to 2002. Over the
4 years of data collection 21,004
persons were selected and inter-
viewed. Of those, oral health ex-
aminations were completed on
1,904 children aged 2-6 years. More
detailed information on the sample
design and operation of NHANES
1999-2002 can be found elsewhere
(14). Our study was limited to chil-
dren who were 2-6 years old with at
least 10 primary teeth present in the
mouth at the time of the oral exami-
nation. This age group was chosen to
focus the analysis on primary tooth
caries. The number of children
meeting the eligibility criteria of this
study was 1,507 ­ among those, 71
percent had all 20 primary teeth.
Household interviews provided
information on demographic vari-
ables, medical history, and health-
related behaviors of the 2- to 6-year-
old children. Demographic variables
included gender, ethnicity, age at
examination, and the poverty index
(PI). The PI was computed as a
ratio between the midpoint of the
reported family income category and
the poverty threshold value deter-
mined by the Census Bureau. Conse-
quently, a PI value below 1 indicates
that the family income is below the
poverty threshold. Medical history
was obtained in the interview,
including information on asthma,
arthritis, cancer or malignancy,
chronic bronchitis, coronary heart
disease, ear infection, diabetes, hay
fever, and stroke. Since few children
had arthritis, cancer or malignancy,
chronic bronchitis, coronary heart
disease, diabetes, and/or stroke, only
asthma was included in our analysis.
Oral health examinations were
conducted in the mobile examination
centers (MEC) and included dentition
and periodontal assessments. Each
quadrant was dried with air and
examined with a surface reflection
mirror and a No.23 explorer. The
dentition assessment included tooth
count, coronal caries, root caries,
dental sealants, incisor trauma, and
enamel fluorosis. Coronal caries was
assessed by trained and calibrated
dentists using a visual-tactile method
with standardized equipment and
supplies. Since this study was limited
to children 2-6 years old, only
coronal caries was included in the
analysis. The number of decayed and
filled teeth (dft) was calculated for
each participant. Participant's caries
status was categorized into three
groups: 0 dft, 1-5 dft, and >5 dft. The
filling component represented a
tooth surface that has been restored
with either a permanent or a tempo-
rary restoration as a result of caries.
Because of difficulty of correctly dis-
tinguishing among teeth extracted
for caries and other reasons, such as
exfoliation and trauma, missing teeth
count was not included in this analy-
sis. Further, using criteria from the
American Academy of Pediatric Den-
tistry, severe early childhood caries
(S-ECC) was defined as follows: any
sign of smooth surface decay in chil-
dren younger than 3 years of age;
one or more decayed or filled sur-
faces in primary maxillary anterior
teeth from ages 3 to 5 years; or
dfs 4 (age 3), 5 (age 4), or 6
(age 5) (14).
Weight and height were measured
during a physical examination.
Weight was measured when the child
stood on a digital scale that was
connected to the Integrated Survey
Information System (ISIS) and stand-
ing height was measured with an
electronic stadiometer that was also
connected to the ISIS. BMI was cal-
culated using the standard formula:
weight in kilograms (kg) divided by
height in meter squared (m2). Chil-
dren were classified into four catego-
ries using age- and gender-specific
criteria recommended by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention
(15): underweight ­ less than 5th
percentile; normal weight ­ 5th per-
centile to less than 85th percentile; at
risk of overweight ­ 85th to less than
95th percentile; and overweight ­
equal to or greater than the 95th
percentile. Dietary variables included
in this analysis were daily total
energy (kcal) intake, daily total car-
bohydrate intake, daily total fat
intake, and daily total sugar intake.
Dietary data were collected by
trained and calibrated registered
dietitians through 24-hour recall
interviews to estimate the intake of
food energy, nutrients, and nonnutri-
ent food components from foods
and beverages consumed during the
24-hour period (from midnight to
midnight) prior to the MEC examina-
tions (16).
Individual characteristics were
categorized and presented as per-
centages or means (standard error).
c2 analyses and Kruskal­Wallis tests
were used to compare social-
demographic, dietary, medical, and
dental variables between caries
experience categories and among
BMI categories. c2 test was used
to test for categorical associations
between caries prevalence and BMI
categories after stratifying by age and
race. Further, BMI categories were
compared between caries-free chil-
dren and those with S-ECC using c2
test after stratifying by age, race, and
gender. Logistic regression models
were developed to predict caries
experience (yes/no). The model
included the variables that were
significant in bivariate analyses or
thought to be potentially important:
child's BMI category, child's age,

child's carbohydrate intake, race, and
family income. All statistical tests
were conducted in SAS 9.1 at the
0.05 level of significance. The
NHANES Analytic and Reporting
Guidelines were followed to apply
appropriate weighting methodology
for adjustment for the complex
sample design and the unequal
probability of selection; the variables
SDMVSTRA, SDMVPSU, and
WTMEC4YR provided with the
NHANES 1999-2002 data were used
for this purpose (14).
Results
Characteristics of the 2- to 6-year-
old children are summarized in
Table 1. About 4.2 percent were
underweight, 73.9 percent had
normal weight, 11.3 percent were at
risk of overweight, and 10.6 percent
were obese; 42.0 percent had at least
one decayed and/or filled tooth ­ 30.0
percent had one to five dft and 12.0
percent had more than five dft; the
mean number of dft was 1.8 (SE 0.09).
Table 2 presents caries experi-
ence and BMI categories according
to social-demographic, dietary,
medical, and dental visit characteris-
tics. Overall, there was no statistically
significant difference in percentage
distribution of caries experience and
BMI categories by gender, PI, race,
asthma condition, dental visit in the
previous 12 months, daily total
energy intake, daily carbohydrate
intake, daily fat intake, or daily total
sugar intake. Caries experience (both
percent of children with caries and
the mean dft score) was compared
across the BMI categories stratified
by age and race (Table 3). Generally,
children with at-risk BMI or over-
weight BMI had a higher percentage
of caries and higher mean dft than
children with normal BMI, although
percentages and mean dft for BMI
categories varied in different strata.
Most of these differences across BMI
categories were not statistically
significant, except for percentages
in the 60- <72-month age group
(P = 0.049) and mean dft among
African-American race (P = 0.02).
When the comparison was only
between the children with at risk
BMI and the children with normal
BMI, those with at-risk BMI had a
significantly higher percentage with
caries and higher mean dft in the
60-<72-month age group and signifi-
cantly higher mean dft in the African-
American (P = 0.01) and Hispanic
(P = 0.02) strata (last column in
Table 3).
No statistically significant differ-
ence was found in the comparison of
BMI category distribution ­ stratified
by age and race ­ between caries-free
children and those with S-ECC
(Table 4). The majority of children in
both groups had a normal BMI and
only a few were underweight. The
results comparing percentage distri-
bution of only normal and at risk BMI
between caries-free children and
those with S-ECC showed a similar
pattern (last column in Table 4). Four
dietary variables including daily total
carbohydrate intake, daily total sugar
intake, daily total fat intake, and daily
total energy intake were examined
for individual relationship with caries
experience using Spearman correla-
tion analysis. The correlation co-
efficients were 0.01 (P = 0.71) for
carbohydrate intake, 0.04 (P = 0.28)
for sugar intake, 0.002 (P = 0.92) for
fat intake, and 0.02 (P = 0.51) for total
energy intake.

decayed/filled tooth: yes/no) was
fitted using five predictor variables:
age (years), poverty (PI; <2 or 2),
obesity (BMI 95 percentile), race
(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic
Black, Hispanic, or others), and car-
bohydrate intake (tertiles: <187 mg,
187- <288 mg, 288 mg). In this mul-
tivariable logistic regression model
(Table 5), none of these factors was
a statistically significant predictor of
caries experience. Using the same
five predicator variables, a logistic
regression model was also fitted for
predicting S-ECC (yes/no in Table 5).
Age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.82, P < 0.01]
and PI (OR = 0.59, P = 0.01) were
statistically significant in predicting
severe early childhood caries.
Discussion
Using data from NHANES 1999-
2002, the relationship between child-
hood obesity and dental caries was
assessed. In this sample of 1,507 2- to
6-year-old children, dental caries was
a prevalent disease. Most children
had normal BMI; however, about 11
percent were at risk of overweight
and 10 percent were actually over-
weight. The observation is consistent
with other studies related to child-
hood obesity (17-18). After stratifying
by age, gender, race, and family
income, the relationships between
childhood obesity and dental caries
were not statistically significant,
except among children aged
60-72 months. It is unclear why the
dental caries-obesity relationship for
the 60-72 month group differs from
the other age groups. One possible
explanation is that both are age-
related cumulative conditions and
thus the older group is more likely to
exhibit a stronger relationship. In the
comparison between children with at
risk BMI and those with normal BMI,
a significant association was detected
not only for the 60-<72 months age
group, but also for the African-
American and Hispanic children.
This is consistent with some studies
that have reported higher prevalence
of both obesity and dental caries
among children from minority
groups and/or low SES families (1,
13, 19). The observed association

different relationships, particularly
when samples consisted of local,

Obesity and Dental Caries in Children 231
picture in which many factors may
simultaneously influence the rela-
tionship between caries and obesity.
Both obesity and dental caries are
complex conditions and many bio-
logical, genetic, environmental, and
behavioral factors are known to be
involved in these conditions (19-21).
In some developed countries, dental
caries has been linked to SES factors,
such as family income, parents' edu-
cation and occupation, with low SES
individuals being at higher risk of
caries (2, 17-18, 22). In the United
States childhood obesity is also asso-
ciated with low SES (14, 23). Marshall
et al. identified measures of SES
(parents' education and family
income) that were predictive of both
caries experience and obesity among
children in an Iowa cohort (19). In
our analysis, family income was
identified as an important predictor
of caries experience, after controlling
for age, race, and BMI category.
Additionally, relationships between
health outcomes and contextual
characteristics ­ particular aspects of
places where people live ­ have
been documented in a number of
empirical studies of various health
conditions (24).Therefore, character-
istics of the population, including a
broader set of socioeconomic and
contextual characteristics, must be
considered when the relationship
between childhood obesity and
dental caries is assessed.
One of the important findings of
this study was that children at risk
of being overweight generally had
higher caries experience than their
normal weight peers. This observa-
tion is consistent with what other
investigators reported (6, 7, 10, 19).
Although the mechanism is not clear,
caries co-existed with the risk of
being overweight in these studies.
Marshall et al. (19) suggested that
neither "obesity increases risk of
caries" nor "caries increases risk of
obesity," but rather a common risk
factor increased the likelihood of
both diseases. Dietary factors and
SES were hypothesized to be
common risk factors that potentially
link obesity and dental caries. A
dietary habit that contributes to
obesity could also increase caries
risk. It is well established that a
dietary component is necessary for
the caries disease process. Dietary
habits (how much and how often the
beverage or food is consumed) can
modify caries risk, with frequent
consumption of sugars considered
to increase the risk. Energy-dense,
highly refined food choices and
dietary habits have been identified as
important contributors to the obesity
epidemic (25-27). Identification of
children at risk of being overweight
early in life may give health care
providers and parents the oppor-
tunities for early intervention to de-
crease risk for both obesity and
caries. Furthermore, educational
interventions addressing dietary
issues should highlight both conse-
quences (overweight and dental
caries) simultaneously.
This analysis utilized a nationally
representative sample and thus
allowed for greater examination of
complexity in the relationship be-
tween obesity and dental caries.
However, some limitations must be
observed. Since the data was cross-
sectional, causal relationships cannot
be established and the observed
association could be due to other
unexplored factors. Part of the data
was based on self-reports and thus
subject to recall bias. Furthermore,
since the reasons for missing teeth
could not be explicitly sought,
missing teeth were excluded from
the analysis. This may have excluded
a certain number of teeth lost due to
caries.
In conclusion, within study limi-
tations, results from this analysis of
a large national sample of young
children suggest a complex multi-
factorial relationship between child-
hood obesity and dental caries. This
demands carefully defined research
designs, including longitudinal
studies, to identify the particular
pathways through which different
factors influence dental caries and
obesity.
