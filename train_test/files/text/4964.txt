Introduction
Plagiarism within university settings is a widespread phe-
nomenon that manifests itself in a variety of forms and
includes transgressions that can be classified as instances of
academic dishonesty (i.e., student cheating) as well as
instances of research misconduct. Although the bulk of
research into plagiarism as academic misconduct has been
carried out in English-speaking nations (e.g., Australia, the
United States), studies have now been emerging, document-
ing this transgression in many countries across the world.
One country that has received some attention in recent years
is Iran, a nation that is experiencing significant academic and
scientific growth.
Iran is an Islamic republic with a population of about 76
million. When the Islamic Revolution happened in 1979, there
were approximately 150,000 university students in Iran. By
2008, there were 3.5 million university students (Tofighi
Darian, 2009). That number now stands at about 4.5 million
students (Sedighi, 2014). At the professional level, there are
more than 55,000 faculty members with a PhD working at
Iranian academic institutes (Sedighi, 2014). Also, many doc-
toral-level students will be looking for new teaching and
research positions, plus some of the several thousand students
currently studying outside Iran (Moslemi Naeini, 2013) who
will likely return to Iran. The number of tertiary academic
institutes in Iran was 223 in 1979, but, in 2013, this number
has reached 2,540 (Bolookat, 2014). With so many young aca-
demics in the pipeline and a faltering economic situation, it is
likely that additional academic positions necessary to meet the
needs of the country will not be created. Thus, securing an
academic position already is increasingly competitive and will
likely become even more so in the near future. An additional
complication is that few international students enroll in the
Iranian universities. So, the universities may have to lower
their admissions criteria to enroll more students and survive.
But, even with lower academic standards, students in the
humanities will still need to prepare term papers and write the-
ses. However, if some of these students lack proper academic
skills, how will they be able to complete their assignments? In
addition, one has to wonder how all of those unemployed PhD
or MA graduates will be able to make a living.
In this article, we study what we call the "plagiarism
industry" in Iran. We have interviewed a group of enterpris-
ing students who, at the time of the interviews, were earning
a living, or had done so in the past, by writing other students'
term papers and theses. The qualitative data obtained have
provided us with insights that reveal the complexities of this
plagiarism industry and offer clues about the causes, effects,
and the economic realities that underlie this activity. But
first, we will examine the state of plagiarism in Iran accord-
ing to the available literature.

Confessions of Academic Ghost Authors:
The Iranian Experience
Ehsan Shahghasemi1 and Manijeh Akhavan1
Abstract
Academic plagiarism exists in all academic spheres, but contextual factors determine the level, intensity, and forms of it.
Over the last few years, the phenomenon of "Ghost Authorship" has become widespread in Iran, and concerns have been
expressed regarding this issue, not only by academicians but also by officials. In this study, 143 students participated in a
two-step interview study in which they spoke about their experiences on either seeing a ghost author doing the research
of someone else in exchange of money or they themselves being a ghost author. In all, 29 students said that they had done
it once or so. The in-depth interviews with these 29 students showed how the plagiarism industry works in Iran, who the
customers are, how they find each other, and so on.

of the world that published the so-called "top 1% most cited
publications" (Habibzadeh, 2008, p. 171). From 1996 to
2007, Iranian researchers published 8,797 citable medical
papers (Scopus®) and ranked 39 in the world, but their H
index (an index that estimates the importance and impact of
contributions by a scientist or a country) was 40, placing Iran
in the 69th position. There are many factors contributing to
this relatively low citation rate, including the vicious cycle of
poor methodology and plagiarism (Farrokhi, 2009).
Plagiarism is not something special to Iran or even to our
time. But, as mentioned earlier, the extraordinary demand for
having an academic certificate has convinced many people
that they can make a lot of money by selling academic ser-
vices. In the most notable example, the late Ali Kordan, an
ally of the Iranian President, was fired from his job as
Minister Interior in 2008 when he was found to have lied
about having received an honorary doctorate from Oxford
University (Burke, Tomlinson, & Coope, 2012). And in
2009, Nature published an article with a peculiar title "Iranian
ministers in plagiarism row," which was a reaction to a chain
of scandals in which some academic journals found papers
by some of the Iranian authorities were in fact plagiarized
and were subsequently retracted (Butler, 2009). After that
episode, a group of researchers responded to the charges by
pointing out that much of the fraud has been perpetrated by
politicians, and not Iranian full-time academics (Bloch,
2012). Moreover, in an effort to further combat the percep-
tion that Iranian academics might in some way condone
these activities, some of the Iranian professors and research-
ers founded the weblog "Professors Against Plagiarism."
Research on Plagiarism in Iran
A number of studies have been carried out in Iran in an effort
to examine the various parameters of plagiarism. For exam-
ple, Ojaghi, Keyvanara, Cheshmeh Sohrabi, and Papi (2011)
carried out a qualitative study on faculty members at
University of Esfahan, Iran, in which the authors sought the
opinion of study participants regarding the main causes of
plagiarism in Iran's academic community. The professors
who participated in this research identified two major vari-
ables as important in this respect. Internally, those who have
been raised in families in which ethical conduct is regarded
seriously were said to be less likely to plagiarize. In addition,
participants felt that plagiarism is more likely to occur in a
climate in which such behavior is more common and less
likely to be met with criticism and punishment. With respect
to the latter point, it is interesting to point out that Donald
McCabe, one of the most prominent authorities in academic
dishonesty, has consistently found that one of the strongest
predictors of academic dishonesty is the academic integrity
climate of an institution (McCabe, Trevino, & Butterfield,
2001). That is, based on several studies using thousands of
NorthAmerican students, these authors conclude that students
are more likely to cheat if they believe that other students
engage in this behavior and get away with it. Finally, Ojaghi
et al. also revealed that among their 21 participants, some
admitted that the PhD certificates of some current professors
in the Iranian universities are not genuine.
Fealy, Biglari, and Pezeshkirad (2012) conducted a sur-
vey on 225 graduate students in large public university in
Tehran in an effort to determine how these students viewed
plagiarism. They found that most of the students had slightly
unfavorable or neutral attitudes toward plagiarism. They also
found a significant difference between those who attended
article-writing courses and those who did not, in viewing
plagiarism unethical. Their survey showed that only about
40% of their respondents said they do not plagiarize, which
means that the remaining 60% are overtly saying they resort
to plagiarism to prepare their term papers. Similarly,
Khamesan and Amiri (2011) surveyed 400 students from 4
faculties and 30 majors at a different university and their
results revealed that fewer than half of the students would
not resort to plagiarism when they felt the need to do so,
while more than a half of their respondents said that plagia-
rism is common in their university. They also found that the
number of male students who said they resorted to plagia-
rism was significantly higher in comparison with that of
female students. Based on their survey and other data, they
concluded that plagiarism is very common in Iran.
In one study, Amirkhani, Vahdat, and Khezrian (2010)
conducted a survey on 250 students in a public university to
see whether there was any correlation between psychological
characteristics and Internet plagiarism, and reported that
extroversion, academic talent, and emotional stability are
among the important factors preventing students from doing
plagiarism on the Internet.
Ghost Writing as Alternative to
Plagiarism
Although most students who plagiarize seem to do so by tak-
ing textual material that is already freely available to them
via paper or online sources, a small percentage of them
(about 5%) are known to have confederates produce the
work on their behalf or purchase the work via one of the
many online essay writing services or "paper mills" that have
emerged over the years (Scanlon & Neumann, 2002). In
view of the economic realities facing Iran and given the cur-
rent academic climate at many Iranian academic institutions,
we wanted to examine the problem of plagiarism from the
perspective of those who offer term paper and essay services
or seek such services in Iran. For this purpose, we carried out
informal interviews with a sample of students ranging from
those holding Baccalaureate degrees to those holding PhD
degrees. The purpose of this investigation was to explore the
extent of this particular type of plagiarism in Iran and the
conditions that give rise to this behavior.

Method
Subjects
A convenience sample consisted of 143 BA, MA, and PhD
students in humanities from a major Iranian University par-
ticipated in this research (see Table 1). Age data were not
collected.
Materials
All respondents were asked the following two questions
("Have you ever heard a classmate of yours paid somebody
else to do his or her homework/final paper?" and "Have you
ever worked on a project of somebody else in exchange of
money?"). If they answered in the affirmative, they were
then interviewed.
Procedure
Given the sensitive nature of the topic, we knew from the
beginning that getting students to reveal their true opinions
and actual practices regarding their academic writing would
be no easy task. After all, even after assuring them of the
anonymity of their responses, people are probably not going
to be completely open about their unethical behaviors if they
know that their responses are going to be presented in a
paper. Therefore, part of the inclusion criteria for the inter-
view was based on a subjective determination on the part of
the interviewers (E.S. and S.A.) that the respondents were
being honest. Thus, during a period of 18 months from May
2012 to November 2013, we interviewed 143 students in dif-
ferent majors of humanities. These majors included social
sciences, communication studies, management, theology,
political relations, psychology, regional studies, and so on.
Because of the sensitivity of the subject, most of the inter-
views were carried out during social chats in a friendly atmo-
sphere, so the interviewees, all of whom were known to the
interviewers, were not aware of the purpose of chats. Only in
cases in which there was a mutual trust between interviewee
and interviewer, the participant was informed about the
nature of conversation. Those who reported that they did not
write papers or theses for other students were asked only two
questions. But, those who said that their job was or is to do
other people's academic work were interviewed in greater
depth.
Results and Discussion
In this section, we present a summary of the responses to
each of the questions and use selected participant responses
to illustrate some of the findings.
In response to the question, "Have you ever heard a
classmate of yours paid somebody else to do his or her
homework/final paper?" 117 of 143 participants said "yes."
This figure means that 81% of participants reported to have
witnessed somebody in their academic circle paying some-
body else to do his or her scientific assignment. All 100% of
the PhD students, 88% of MA students, and 72% of BA stu-
dents in humanities said that they have witnessed a case.
Some of the participants elaborated the instances of such
transactions. For example, a MA-level female, age 25,
reported,
I know a former classmate of mine who was divorced and got
money from her ex-husband. She said she does not bother
herself doing these "stupid things." She said in each semester
she employs the best people to write her an original paper. She
said sometimes, just a smile would be enough.
A female, PhD, age 32, commented, "It is very common.
I am wondering, did you not see many posters offering such
services on street walls?" A 23-year-old female student in a
BA program reported,
Afriend of mine was in a terrible stress. She thought she couldn't
write the article our rigorous professor expected. Therefore she
paid a small stipend to a MA student and he wrote the paper. We
then found that this student had many similar papers which were
sold to customers cheaply.
In response to the question, "Have you ever worked on a
project of somebody else in exchange of money?" a total of
29 of the respondents answered affirmatively, and a majority
of them were PhD students. All these respondents reported to
have prepared somebody else's assignment at least once (see
Table 2).

It is noteworthy that only 6 of 76 (8%) of the female
respondents said "yes" to this question, suggesting that
females are less likely to engage in these unethical academic
practices, whereas 34% of male respondents reported to have
done so. Also, as noted above, it seems that those with more
education are more likely to engage in this activity, perhaps
because they are expected to have better writing skills and be
more knowledgeable about the subjects that they are asked to
write about. One other factor could be due to the fact that
higher levels of education are by nature associated with
higher age status, which means that the individual has more
responsibilities, and most of these responsibilities need
money.
Those who denied writing paper for money offered vari-
ous reasons for their reluctance to do so. For example, a
29-year-old PhD male reported that
though I have had many such offers, I could never convince
myself writing for somebody else. I, like everybody else, prefer
to be the sole owner of my work. If someone cannot write, he or
she can give up and go for some job else.
A 19-year-old female BA student said,
I am very busy and I cannot do my work the way I like. I have
no time to do such thing . . . yes, if somebody offers me a good
payment and I am sure of the ability of myself to do so, I may
consider it.
Another female, age 23, in a BA program said, "I don't do
it because it is robbery. It is as ugly as that. But people justify
it for themselves." Similarly, a 19-year-old male BA student
did not think that the act was ethical: "If it becomes a routine,
you will simply witness someone who is stupid becoming a
top student of our class just because he or she is rich and can
afford to pay PhD students." Finally, a 31-year-old female
PhD student who felt strongly against writing assignments
for other students said,
Not only I have never done it, I push back every one who makes
me such offers . . . yes, indeed I have had such offers, but I have
never accepted them. Everyone needs money, but at what price?
I think it is better to steal money from the poor and not enter
such a dirty job.
For the 29 students who claimed to have at least one time
done somebody else's work in exchange of money, we asked
them to provide details about different aspects of this activ-
ity, and what follows represents a summary of these
findings.
Rationale for Engaging in Ghost Authorship
The vast majority of the respondents justified their ghost
writing activities by claiming that they were in financial dis-
tress or felt pressure to generate some additional income. The
following remarks by various respondents illustrate this
point. A 33-year-old male PhD student reported,
Well, I am not from the capital and you know that the capital is
a wild city. Without money, I could barely eat. My family could
not afford to secure enough money for me. Therefore I did it five
or six times.
According to a 22-year-old male BA student, "Every
human being has a minimum of needs. I only do it when I am
in financial pressure." A 25-year-old male MA student
remarked,
It goes back to when I had to support my younger brother.
Actually, no one expected me to support him. But, I was the
older brother and I was naturally supposed to do so. It also gave
me the opportunity to live on my own and therefore I helped my
family to stay on their feet after the financial losses they
experienced at that time.
Others rationalized their actions in terms of professional
status. For example, a 34-year-old male PhD student argued,
"I have spent my life to become a professional, but I cannot
afford to buy a car. So I have to accept offers to write theses.
This is life; don't be stupid." A 28-year-old BA male
remarked, "I do this because I need money. This is very stu-
pid not to accept money. Without money, you are dead."
Who Are the Customers?
We were interested in learning about the characteristics of
those who seek ghost writing services, and we, therefore,
asked them to describe them in some detail. Their responses
indicated that a large proportion of their customers were
wealthier students who attended a nearby private university
with several branches in the Tehran area. Of course, not all
the student-customers were from that one university.
Moreover, in some cases, the respondents indicated that
some of their customers were actual professors. Interestingly,
several respondents indicated that they were approached by
many more female than male students. Some customers
tended to be governmental managers who felt the need to
further their studies to get to better qualify for a promotion or
to simply ensure that they can maintain their current posi-
tion. There was also the suggestion that as an increasing
number of Iranians have advanced degrees, these govern-
ment managers feel somewhat intimidated by the prospect of
having to work in a system in which many of their subordi-
nates are better educated than their managers. The following
responses illustrate these trends. A 38-year-old male PhD
student stated,
They are mainly from [. . .] University. They are wealthy. They
pay you well and they pay well for everything. But, they are not
just from [. . .] university. There are other customers as well.
Most of them are women who want to write their thesis. There
Shahghasemi and Akhavan 5
are also men . . . They are mainly older than ordinary students. I
think they just came here to get a degree and they don't care for
quality.
A 32-year-old female PhD student reported that "they are
from many backgrounds. But because I don't work profes-
sionally, my customers are mainly from my university and [.
. .] University." Another female respondent, a 25-year-old
MA student, stated the following:
I only occasionally got such offers. Most of them are from my
university but I have also offers from [. . .] University and other
academic institutes. I am more comfortable working with
women because they know me and I know them by nature. The
other reason is that I am a girl and I cannot quarrel with men
about money. Given that there are enough requests coming from
women, why should I bother myself quarreling with men?
Finally, a 33-year-old male PhD student commented,
I only work with [. . .] University students because I don't want
my friends and colleagues at my university to know about it.
Moreover, their professors are not rigorous as ours. My
experience is that they accept everything the students email
them. Most of my customers are women.
One 32-year-old female PhD student reported that one of
her customers was a college professor. She stated,
For example, I know a professor who likes to publish many
academic articles. He pays me well and I write the articles for
him. Sometimes he includes me as author, but at other times, he
lists himself as sole author.
How They Find Each Other
In English-speaking countries, if a student wishes to pur-
chase a term paper for use in a course, all she or he needs to
do is an Internet search for term papers, academic essays,
and theses. A plethora of sites purport to have stocks of thou-
sands of papers, which are sorted by topic. Many of these
sites also offer custom-written papers, which students can
arrange to order from the privacy of their own home as long
as she or he has an Internet connection and a credit card. Our
current sample of 29 ghost authors revealed a variety of dif-
ferent ways of promulgating and arranging for these services.
For example, a 32-year-old male PhD student stated,
Both [informal] social network and advertisements are
important. I also have a liaison with corporations which are
active in the industry. They call me and give me the proposal. I
will tell them my price. Then they add 30% and share it with the
customers. I like working for myself, indeed. But it is not
possible to find all of the customers via social networks.
The above arrangements are similar to those described
some years ago by Witherspoon (1995) and more recently by
Tomar (2012).
This job is illegal, and moreover, academia is a special
place in which plagiarism is harshly criticized. Yet, this busi-
ness needs both parties to get to know each other. Therefore,
it seems that only those who are less professional in this busi-
ness accept jobs from the same institutes. More professional
people find their customers in other institutes. Examples
follow:
One 25-year-old female MA student reports that requests
for papers ". . . are mainly from the people whom I know, but
in some cases I find them through shared friends. Sometimes,
students from [. . .] University come to our faculty and try to
find the right person." Our research reveals that most of the
orders are facilitated by social network. But, for profession-
als, advertising institutes are involved. They overtly adver-
tise in faculties in every university. A 33-year-old male PhD
student stated that "women talk to each other more openly as
compared to men and so, most of them find me through their
friends." Another 33-year-old male PhD student said that
"they come to faculty and ask for help and the faculty mem-
bers redirect them to you. Even now I have occasionally
received these proposals." Finally, a 29 year-old male BA,
said that he
worked with a bunch of people. They give me the projects and I
do it. I have been told not to try to come in direct contact with
customers; otherwise, they will dismiss me. I am contented with
the stipend and there is no reason for raising conflict of interest
complains.
Originality and Quality
We tried to explore the degree of originality and the quality
of the ghost-written works. Here, respondents' answers to
our questions suggest that most of the ghost-written papers
they produce are not very original and not necessarily of
good quality. For example, a 32-year-old male PhD student
stated the following:
Frankly, I have dozens "Reviews of Literature," "Methodology
sections," "Results," etc. For each customer, I assemble the texts
and it's done. After 6 months, you get to know professors and
understand how to assemble the thesis in a way that he or she
approves it. I don't even think that most of them read the thesis
thoroughly. Generally, I write a MA thesis in a single day.
The approach to ghost writing of picking and choosing from
a collection of archived sections of papers was also men-
tioned by a 34-year-old male PhD student in connection with
offering his services to a university professor:
When I was doing it for my professor, I did it brilliantly. I
expected him to at least include my name as a co-author. He paid
me well but refused to include my name. Therefore, I didn't
bother myself working hard for the next work. Also, I found that
neither he nor somebody else doesn't read the articles critically.
Therefore, I still do that whenever I am in need of money. I got
same money for less effort. For others, however, I don't take
6 SAGE Open
much time. I have many texts on my laptop. This is just a matter
of mingling texts and selling them.
One theme that was repeated several times was the appar-
ent lack of evaluation of students' works by their professors.
For example, a 27-year-old male BA student revealed the
following:
At first I was very sensitive about the quality. Now, I don't care.
Let me give you a wonderful example. You don't believe it. Four
years ago, when I was a BA student, I entered this job. I wrote a
thesis for a MA student. It had been thoroughly copy-pasted
with slight modifications. The student paid my stipend and
invited me to attend his defense session. Amidst the discussions
on quality of his thesis, I browsed the thesis and with a great
horror found I had forgot to remove the acknowledgment of the
previous thesis. I couldn't believe that. I immediately came out
of the session but in the evening he called me and said he got a
somehow good point.
Conclusion
Collectively, the available evidence, together with the mate-
rial generated by the respondents in this informal study, sug-
gests that the state of academic integrity in Iran is not unlike
that of other Western nations. Copy pasting from online
sources seems to be a common form of plagiarizing from
sources, and there is even some indication that the Iranian
authorities are trying to do something about it, though their
actions may actually facilitate the ghost writing by copy
pasting for a select lucky few who have access to a lot of
scholarly content. Consider the following remarks by a
28-year-old male BA student:
Previously, there was a possibility of downloading full text
theses in Persian language. My friends have downloaded so
many of them. Now, the Ministry of Science and Technology
does not let users download them anymore. In fact, they are no
longer on the Internet. Do you know what that means? That
means you can simply copy-paste material and nobody could
know it by searching on the Internet. That's the reason people
come to us and pay us well.
As Witherspoon (1995) and Tomar (2012) have shown,
many North American students at various academic levels
will hire ghost writers to generate their term papers, theses,
and dissertations, and, in spite of the astronomically high
cost of tuition in North American academic institutions, or
the dire economic realities facing Iranians, students in both
areas of the world continue to cheat by paying others to do
their academic work for them.
