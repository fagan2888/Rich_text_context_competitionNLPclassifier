Introduction
The overall global incidence of cutaneous malignant mela-
noma has been sharply growing over the past 50 years, with
the highest rates outside of Australia and New Zealand being
seen in a number of Northern European countries (Erdmann
et al., 2013). Recent 10-year follow-up evidence from a ran-
domized controlled trial suggests that melanoma may be pre-
vented by using sunscreen, provided it is used optimally (i.e.,
applied every morning and reapplied after heavy sweating,
bathing, or long sun exposure; Green, Williams, Logan, &
Strutton, 2011). Despite Green et al.'s (2011) study provid-
ing strong evidence for the effectiveness of sunscreen under
trial conditions (Robinson & Bigby, 2011), historical evi-
dence from the late 1990s has shown that, in practice, many
people do not apply sunscreen optimally (Robinson &
Rademaker, 1998; Wartha Wright, Wright, & Wagner, 2001).
Epidemiological evidence from case­control studies is
inconclusive, with some studies suggesting that sunscreen
can reduce the risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin
cancers, and others suggesting that using sunscreen might
actually increase the risk of melanoma by encouraging
greater sunbathing time and thus ultraviolet (UV) exposure
(Autier, 2001; Burnett & Wang, 2011; LeBoit, Burg, Weedon,
& Sarasin, 2006; Planta, 2011; Weinstock, 2001). A meta-
analysis by Dennis, Beane Freeman, and VanBeek (2003)
identified seven case­control studies that reported a
decreased risk of melanoma and nine studies that reported an
increased risk of melanoma, although combined odds ratios
of these studies failed to show either a significantly protec-
tive or harmful association between sunscreen use and mela-
noma. One of the main limitations of such case­control
studies is that they are based on sunscreen use question-
naires, which use broad and sometimes subjective categories
to measure the frequency of sunscreen use (e.g.,
"often"/"rarely"/"always," Wolf et al., 1998) and are subject
to recall bias. Although sales do not directly equate to use (as
not all product bought is necessarily used), market data can
be considered a useful means of estimating use (in volume)
because sales data are not subject to recall bias. To date, there
have been no cross-national, population-based ecological
studies exploring the association between melanoma preva-
lence and sunscreen sales data.
UV exposure is the only established exogenous causal
factor for melanoma (Westerdahl, Ingvar, Masback, &
Olsson, 2000), and UV radiation has been shown to
have a strong negative association with latitude (Elwood
et al., 1974). Epidemiologists have also explored whether

Sunscreen Sales, Socio-Economic Factors,
and Melanoma Incidence in Northern
Europe: A Population-Based Ecological
Study
Simon N. Williams1 and Kimberly A. Dienes2
Abstract
In this ecological study, we drew upon recently published melanoma prevalence data, and compared them with historical
market data and published socio-economic data to test for an association between historical sunscreen sales (1997-1999) and
recent melanoma incidences (2008 and 2012) in 24 countries in Northern Europe. We also explored associations between
current melanoma incidences and historical data on the following socio-demographic indicators: income, urbanization, and
population aging. Melanoma incidences were higher in high-income countries where sales of sunscreen were also higher. Our
results show that, at the population level, income was significantly associated with melanoma incidences,  = 0.0003, t(19) =
3.104, p < .006, and that increased sunscreen sales has not prevented higher income populations from being at higher risk
of melanoma.

socio-demographic variables, like income, aging, and urban-
ization, are also risk factors for melanoma.Anumber of stud-
ies at the local or national level suggest that risk of melanoma
is higher among higher income populations within a country
(Bentham & Aase, 1996; Haider, Mamdani, & Shear, 2007;
Kerkpatrick, Lee, & White, 1990; Singh et al., 2011; van der
Aa, de Vries, Hoekstra, Coebergh, & Siesling, 2011). Perez-
Gomez et al. (2008) found that the relative risk of melanoma
generally increased with urbanization (i.e., those living in
larger towns were at higher risk of melanoma). In addition,
increasing age is a risk factor for melanoma, whereby inci-
dence starts to increase throughout adulthood and the highest
age-specific incidence is in the older age groups (Marks,
2001). There are to our knowledge no substantial cross-
national studies exploring the relationships between mela-
noma prevalence and income, urbanization, and aging at the
population level.
In this ecological study, we drew upon recently published
melanoma prevalence data, and compared these data with
historical market data and published socio-economic data to
test for an association between historical sunscreen sales and
recent melanoma incidence in 24 countries in Northern
Europe. We also explored associations between current mel-
anoma incidence and historical data on the following socio-
demographic indicators: income, urbanization, and
population aging.
Our hypothesis is based on best-available evidence, as
provided by Green et al.'s (2011) findings, that if applied
consistently and optimally, sunscreen can effectively reduce
the risk of melanoma among those at risk (Robinson &
Bigby, 2011). Thus, we hypothesized that, after adjusting for
income, urbanization, and aging and after controlling for
latitude, higher historical sunscreen sales would be associ-
ated with lower recent melanoma incidence. Causality of
course cannot be inferred from an ecological study, only a
significant association. However, the presence of such an
association could serve as a basis for further research into
whether and why sunscreen has not been applied consistently
and optimally across populations in line with recommended
guidelines.
Method
Comparable melanoma incidences for 2008 and 2012 (per
100,000 of the population) were retrieved from
GLOBOCAN--a publically available database produced by
the International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC,
2014). A full description of the methodology can be found on
the IARC website (IARC, 2014). According to IARC (2014),
the methods of estimation are country-specific and depend on
the quality and amount of the information available for each
country. However, of the 24 countries in this sample, 21 were
classified as "high quality regional or national data" (17 of
which had coverage greater than 50% of a country's popula-
tion; IARC, 2014). The IARC database provides the general
incidence of melanoma, and did not provide information on
melanoma incidence according to bodily sites nor according
to type (i.e., invasive vs. in situ). Separate incidences for mel-
anoma in men and women were available, as well as com-
bined-sex melanoma incidences. Mean incidences were
calculated using data for 2008 and 2012 (Table 1).
Industry data on sunscreen sales (in volume per capita)
were obtained from the Euromonitor Passport Global Market
Information Database, 2012 Edition (Euromonitor
International, 2012).1 Earliest available data were from 1997.
This study uses mean sunscreen sales per capita between
1997 and 1999 (Table 1). It was felt that data from 1997 to
1999 were sufficient to explore its relationship with mela-
noma rates in 2008 and 2012. Existing research often
assumes a minimum 10-year latency period (Liu & Soong,
1996; Mulliken, Russak, & Rigel, 2012). As such, looking at
sunscreen sales approximately 10 years prior to recent mela-
noma rates can allow us to begin to explore whether there is
an ecological association between the two.
To explore and adjust for the effect of potential confound-
ing factors, we included three socio-demographic variables
in our analyses. Data on income (gross domestic product
[GDP] per capita, expressed in constant 2011 international
dollars purchasing power parity for comparability), urban-
ization (the percentage of the population living in urban
areas), and population aging (the percentage of the popula-
tion older than 65 years) were taken from the World Bank
World Development Indicators Database (2014 edition;
World Bank, 2014). For sunscreen sales, income, urbaniza-
tion, and population aging, all data were historical, expressed
as an average of 3 years from 1997 to 1999 (Table 1).
The model controlled for latitude as a proxy for domes-
tic/everyday UV exposure. Variations in the intensity of UV
exposure are known to be related to melanoma incidences
(Crombie, 1979), and a country's UV Index is closely cor-
related with its latitude. Only countries with latitudes of
45°N and above were used.2 This is consistent with previ-
ous studies that have classified latitudes above 45°N as
"high latitudes" (Chang et al., 2009). This allowed us to
broadly control for a country's general UV exposure.3 Also,
in all countries, the vast majority of the population was
Caucasian.4
Research has shown how, indoor tanning (in which sun-
screen is generally not applied) can also significantly increase
the risk of melanoma (Boniol, Autier, Boyle, & Gandini,
2012), thereby making it a target for regulation across Europe
(Williams, 2012). Differences in sunbed use between coun-
tries may also have contributed to the observed differences in
the incidence of melanoma between countries. We were
unfortunately unable to find any comparable and consistent
data on indoor tanning (sunbed) use for all 24 countries in
this sample, despite extensive searching. A meta-analysis by
Boniol et al. (2012) provided an estimated fraction of mela-
noma cases attributed to sunbed use in Europe for 12 coun-
tries included in this study.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS/PASW Statistics
Version 18 (SPSS, Inc., 2014). The t tests were used to explore
differences between male and female melanoma incidences
and also between melanoma incidences in Western Europe
and Central and Eastern Europe. Linear regressions were
used to explore bivariate relationships between melanoma
incidences and the independent variables--historical sun-
screen sales, income, urbanization, population aging, and lati-
tude. Only those variables that were significantly associated,
or nearly significantly associated (95% confidence interval
[CI]), with melanoma incidences were selected for the final
multivariate regression model.
Results
Bivariate Analyses
A paired-samples t test revealed that melanoma incidences
were higher in 2012 (10.92 ± 5.27) than they were in 2008
(9.89 ± 5.27), t(22) = -5.182, p < .001. Independent-
samples t tests showed that there was no statistically
significant difference in melanoma rates between males
and females (p > .05). We chose to use only combined-sex
melanoma incidence data in our subsequent analyses.
Independent-samples t tests did, however, reveal that mela-
noma incidences in countries in Western Europe were sig-
nificantly higher than in countries in Central and Eastern
Europe, t(22) = 4.78, p < .001.
Bivariate regression analysis showed that there was a sta-
tistically significant relationship between mean sunscreen
sales (1997-1999) and mean melanoma incidences (2008,
2012),  = 0.183, t(22) = 5.207, p < .001. However, contrary
to our hypothesis, higher sunscreen sales were associated
with higher melanoma incidences. Melanoma incidences
were also significantly associated with income,  = 0.0003,
t(22) = 7.406, p < .001; urbanization,  = 0.196, t(22) =
1.953, p = .064; and aging,  = 1.377, t(22) = 5.207, p = .043.
Melanoma incidences were generally higher in countries
with higher income, greater urbanization and a larger propor-
tion of the population aged 65 and older. Thus, these vari-
ables were included in the final regression model.
As noted above, by selecting only those European coun-
tries with average latitude above 45°N, the potential effect of

domestic/everyday UV exposure had already been accounted
for (not including lower latitude/high-UV countries).
However, an additional analysis was performed to see
whether variances in average latitude above 45°N were asso-
ciated with melanoma incidences.Alinear regression showed
that there was no significant association between the latitude
and melanoma incidences in the countries selected in this
study (p > .05). Thus, latitude was not included as a variable
in the final regression model.
Linear regression analysis also showed that there was no
significant relationship between the estimated fraction of
melanoma cases attributed to sunbed use and melanoma inci-
dences (p > .05), although it is important to note the small
sample size (n = 12). The absence of complete data and of
significance in the subset meant that sunbed use was not
included in the multivariate regression model.
Multivariate Regression Analysis
Although our final multivariate regression model (Table 2)
was statistically significant, F(4, 19) = 11.93, p < .001, sun-
screen sales, urbanization and population aging no longer
significantly predicted melanoma incidence. Income
remained significantly positively associated with melanoma
incidence,  = 0.0003, t(19) = 3.104, p < .006. When orga-
nized hierarchically, income significantly increased the mod-
el's predictive capacity, accounting for 14.9% of the total
model's predictive capacity of 65.5%. Adjusted R2 were used
to account for the relatively small sample size.
Discussion
Regional- and national-level studies have shown that the risk
of melanoma is higher among higher income populations
within a country (Bentham &Aase, 1996; Haider et al., 2007;
Kerkpatrick et al., 1990; Singh et al., 2011; van der Aa et al.,
2011). This is to our knowledge the first multi-national com-
parative study to explore show the relationship between
mean disposable income and melanoma rates. After adjust-
ing for sunscreen sales, urbanization and population aging,
income was strongly associated with melanoma incidence,
with high-income countries having higher melanoma inci-
dences. In higher income countries, people have more money
to spend on activities that might entail intermittent high UV
exposure, such as vacationing in lower latitude countries, a
known risk factor (Elwood, 1992). Like most commodities,
sunscreen is generally more affordable in countries with
higher disposable income per capita, which helps to explain
why sales were higher in higher income countries.
Although the association between sunscreen sales and
melanoma incidences lost significance in our final model, we
nonetheless observed that melanoma incidences were gener-
ally higher in countries with higher historical sunscreen
sales. This is an important observation that adds to existing
knowledge on the relationship between sunscreen use and
melanoma risk. Best-available evidence suggests that sun-
screen, when applied optimally, can be effective at the indi-
vidual level (Green et al., 2011). However, our findings
suggest that in practice, sunscreen as a public health measure
has not historically succeeded in protecting against increased
risk of melanoma at the ecological or population level.
Sunscreen sales are a proxy for the amount of time spent in
high-UV areas. However, our findings may also relate to pre-
vious research which has found that the availability of sun-
screen may actually have increased population-wide UV
exposure, because of the false sense of protection it confers
when used improperly (Weinstock, 2001). There is a distinc-
tion to be made between how successfully sunscreen has
been marketed in high-income countries (as revealed by high
per capita sales), and the relative lack of success that these
countries have had in the prevention of melanoma (as
revealed by high melanoma incidences). Our findings can be
understood in relation to historical evidence, which suggests
that during the late 1990s, even though some sunscreens
were chemically effective when applied optimally (Green et
al., 2011), in practice, they were not being applied correctly
by sunbathers during periods of high UV exposure (Robinson
& Rademaker, 1998; Wartha Wright et al., 2001). In short,
our results show that increased sunscreen sales did not miti-
gate against the increased risk that high-income populations
experience as a result of income-related activities like vaca-
tions to lower latitude countries.
Limitations
To reiterate, one of the well-known limitations of ecological
studies is that they can only show an association between
variables and cannot prove causation. Using population-
level data offered the potential for ecological fallacies. Our
data were not able to speak to individual-level behaviors. Per
capita data divide the total volume of sunscreen purchased in
a country by the total population. For instance, per capita
data are unable to tell us whether a small proportion of the
population are buying large volumes of sunscreen, or whether
a large proportion of the population are buying small vol-
umes of sunscreen. Also, data as to who is buying sunscreen
and how it is being used are not included in this study. As
such, it does not tell us the extent to which men are using

sunscreen relative to women, and younger people are using
sunscreen relative to older people, although this is found
elsewhere in the literature (Thieden, Philipsen, Sandby-
Møller, & Wulf, 2005).
Another limitation of this study is that it was not able to
adjust for differences in indoor tanning (sunbed) use between
countries. As discussed above, we did not find a significant
association between the estimated fraction of melanoma
cases attributed to sunbed use and melanoma incidences for
12 countries included in this study. However, these data per-
tained to a limited number of countries (n = 12) and we were
unfortunately unable to find any comparable and consistent
cross-national data on indoor tanning (sunbed) use, despite
extensive searching. Recent data from the "Euromelanoma"
(van der Leest et al., 2011) project suggests that sunbed use
varies between countries, with approximately 25% of those
screened in Belgium reported having used sunbeds com-
pared with less than 10% of those screened in the Ukraine.
Although insufficient for the purposes of this article, the
growing Euromelanoma project may provide valuable and
comparable data on sunbed use across European countries,
which could be used for future studies exploring these trends
at the population level.
It is also worth noting that most of the existing literature
on melanoma and sunscreen use concerns studies conducted
before 1990, when sunscreens with little UVA protection
were available. More recent sunscreens have started to
include ingredients (e.g., avobenzone) that offer some UVA
protection. With UVA being linked to melanoma develop-
ment (Wang et al., 2001) and with newer sunscreens offering
UVA protection, future ecological studies might show a dif-
ferent relationship between sunscreen use and melanoma
rates.
One other consideration is the role of public awareness
campaigns. Again, comparable and quantifiable data on mel-
anoma prevention campaigns were not available across all
the countries in our sample. As with sunbed use, the
"Euromelanoma" campaign offers potential for future cross-
national studies to explore associations between recent large-
scale prevention initiatives (e.g., disseminating information
about skin cancer and offering skin examinations to the gen-
eral public on "Melanoma Day"; van der Leest et al., 2011).
Conclusion
Melanoma incidences were higher in high-income countries
where sales of sunscreen were higher. In short, our results
show that, at the population level, income was significantly
associated with melanoma incidences, and that increased
sunscreen sales has not prevented higher income populations
from being at higher risk of melanoma. From a public health
perspective, our results correspond with existing advice that
sunscreen should be applied according to optimal recom-
mendations (i.e., one teaspoon should be applied to per body
part, prior to sun exposure and should be reapplied regularly
and after activities such as swimming) and alternative meth-
ods of sun protection should be considered (e.g., wearing
clothes and wide-brimmed hats; Robinson & Bigby, 2011).

exposure).

darker skin types that are less sensitive to UV radiation; thus,
