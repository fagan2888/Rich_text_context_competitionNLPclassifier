Abstract
Objectives: To assess depressive disorders in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE)
refractory to medical treatment.
Methods: Adult patients with refractory MTLE completed two questionnaires (Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) had a semi-
structured psychiatric interview and a high resolution MRI scan. For complete neuropsychiatric
diagnosis, as per International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the results were combined with
clinical history and additional information from the patients' family.
Results: Of the 40 patients identified for this case series study which took place from 2008­2012,
31 (77.5%) had a depressive disorder: 14 had dysthymia, 11 had recurrent depressive disorder and
6 had bipolar disorder. Of the nine patients without a firm diagnosis of mood disorder, seven had
isolated symptoms of depression or anxiety and two presented with mixed depression/anxiety
symptoms. Only 8/31 (25.8%) patients were receiving antidepressant treatment. There was no
association between BDI scores and seizure frequency. No significant difference was found
between patients with and without depression and the presence or laterality of HA.
Conclusions: Depressive disorders are common, underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients
with refractory MTLE.

(TLE)11 is one of the most common focal
epilepsies in adults and is usually associated
with hippocampal sclerosis or mesial tem-
poral sclerosis.12 The latter is a specific
syndrome (mesial temporal lobe epilepsy;
MTLE) characterized with seizures that
usually begin in childhood and is frequently
refractory to drug treatment but has good
prognosis with surgical treatment (i.e., 50-
70% patients became seizure-free after sur-
gery).13­16 Pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, or
refractory epilepsy, may be defined as a
failure of two trials of appropriately chosen
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) using maximum
tolerated doses.17 In 30­40% of adult
patients with focal epilepsy, seizures remain
refractory to pharmacological treatment. 18
Furthermore, the uncontrolled epilepsy is
associated with cognitive impairment, psy-
chosocial disorders, and increased morbidity
and mortality.18
Some authors have reported prevalence
rates of psychiatric disorders of 44­88% in
patients with refractory focal epilepsy.19,20
Depression is the most frequently occurring
comorbid psychiatric disorder in epi-
lepsy,42,21 and it may have a direct impact
on the severity of the symptoms of MTLE,
seizure control and its pathogenesis.4 Some
studies4,5,22­25 suggest that the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM)-IV26 for depression, may be valid for
the MTLE population. Indeed, depression
has been associated with MTLE, especially
in patients with left hippocampal atrophy
(HA).27 Cognitive impairments, such as
memory and learning losses are marked in
patients with left MTLE7 and there is a
suggestion that these difficulties may be
associated with depression.28
Hippocampal volume abnormalities have
also been observed in patients with depres-
sion and MTLE29,30, with reduced volumes
either ipsilateral or bilateral to the origin of
the seizures. Several studies have shown
that in epilepsy, untreated depressive symp-
toms may potentially hinder seizure
control,24,27­29,31­35 suggesting that prompt
diagnosis and treatment of depression is
essential in these patients.36 Intrinsic
biological and extrinsic psychological
factors have been suggested as the cause of
the association between MTLE and depres-
sion.22 In addition, reports suggest that the
relationship between epilepsy and psychi-
atric disorders is bidirectional4,5,22,37,39 and
propose that hippocampal sclerosis, bitem-
poral lesions and pharmaco-resistance may
be relevant risk factors. For example, the
pharmacological treatment of depression
and other psychiatric disorders in patients
with MTLE may be challenging in patients
using multiple AEDs, particularly drugs
with enzyme inducing effects which may
affect the incidence of side effects and/or
efficacy of concomitant antidepressants.40­42
The objective of this present study was to
assess depressive disorders in patients with
MTLE refractory to medical treatment.
Methods
Patients
In this case series study, patients were
recruited from the outpatient Epilepsy
Clinic at University of Campinas, Sao
Paulo, Brazil from 2008­2012. Patients
with MTLE who had not responded to two
or more trials of AEDs in mono or poly-
therapy17 and continued with seizures for
more than two years (i.e., seizure frequency
of at least once every two months) prior to
evaluation were eligible for this study. The
diagnosis, clinical symptoms, electroenceph-
alogram (EEG) reports and video-EEG
were reviewed from patient medical records
by two epileptologists (F.C. and C.L.Y.).
The diagnosis of MTLE was made accord-
ing to the International League against
Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria11,12 and further
confirmed by MRI scans.15
All patients had ictal semiology
described by a close relative or documented
by a medical staff during clinic visits or
Gonc
¸alves et al. 753
video-EEG monitoring.43 In addition, all
patients had other clinical and EEG features
consistent with the diagnosis of
MTLE11,12,14 and had no other findings
suggesting extratemporal focal epilepsy.
The following inclusion criteria were met:
(i) clinical manifestations indicative of
MTLE, including stereotyped focal seizures
with de
´ ja
` vu or epigastric sensation,
associated or not with fear and other auto-
nomic symptoms (i.e., auras), followed by
impaired awareness seizure, some with
motor symptoms (i.e., previously known as
complex partial seizure now defined as
dyscognitive or focal seizure with impaired
awareness)44 consisting of staring and lip
smacking or masticatory automatisms or
both, accompanied or not by hand automa-
tisms and contralateral arm dystonia; (ii)
EEGs during wakefulness showed no clear
cut epileptiform abnormalities outside the
temporal lobe electrodes; (iii) epileptiform
EEG abnormalities over temporal regions
on interictal EEGs; (iv) no seizures, or use of
antihistamine or alcohol for at least 12 hours
prior to the psychiatric evaluation.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
presence of dementia, low intellectual level,
or language problems; (2) dual pathology; (3)
metal objects in the body preventing MRI
scans; (4) continuous use of alcohol or illicit
drugs; (5) serious history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, liver disease or kidney diseases;
(6) other psychiatric disorders than those of
class F.30-39 of International Classification
of Diseases (ICD)-10.
All subjects provided signed informed
consent and this study was approved by
the Ethics committee at the University of
Campinas ­ UNICAMP, Campinas, Sao
Paulo, Brazil.
Assessments
The Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI)45­47 and the Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI)47­50 were used
as screening tools for depression. The MINI
is a short standardized diagnostic interview
that evaluates key DSM-IV26 and ICD-10,
psychiatric disorders.47 Modules A and B
were used which distinguish
symptomatology between current major
depressive episode (with or without melan-
cholia) from major depressive episode in the
past and dysthymia. The BDI is an instru-
ment that detects and evaluates the severity
of recent depressive symptoms over the past
two weeks. According to the Brazilian
Portuguese validated version,50 from a
total score of 0-63, a cutoff point of 12 is
used to indicate mild depression, above 20
moderate depression and above 36 severe
depression.
In addition to the questionnaires
psychiatric evaluations were performed by
a board-certified psychiatrist (E.B.G.) using
a semi-structured interview51 for appropri-
ate clinical and depressive disorder diagnosis
and to exclude other psychiatric disorders
according to ICD-10.47 For a complete
neuropsychiatric diagnosis, results from the
semi-structured psychiatric interview and
the two questionnaires were combined with
clinical history and additional information
from the patients' families.
All patients had a 3T MRI scan to assess
the presence of HA and other signs of
hippocampal sclerosis as part of the clinical
routine investigation. The definition of HA
was made by visual analysis by a researcher
and her advisor (E.B.G. and F.C.) MRI
signs of hippocampal sclerosis were defined
as the presence of HA, with or without
signal change (i.e., white matter hyperinten-
sities in T2 and fluid attenuated inversion
recovery [FLAIR]) and changes in hippo-
campal shape and internal structure.12,17
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software (version 22.0 for WindowsÕ;
(IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp,
754 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
USA). The 2 and Fisher's exact tests were
used to compare categorical variables
between groups and Mann-Whitney test
was used to compare numerical variables.
For comparison of three or more groups
Kruskal-Wallis test was used due to the
absence of a normal distribution of the
variables.52­54 All statistical analyses were
2-sided and a P-value < 0.05 was considered
to indicate statistical significance.
Spearman's rank correlation was used to
examine associations between BDI scores
and epilepsy duration and seizure frequency.
Results
Forty patients with pharmaco-resistant
MTLE were included in the study. Their
ages ranged from 24 to 60 years and 26
(65%) were women (Table 1). MRI analysis
showed evidence of HA in 38 (95%) cases;
two patients had a normal MRI scan. Based
on EEG and MRI data, HA occurred most
commonly on the left side (22 [55%]
patients); 12 (30%) patients had a right
HA and four (10%) patients had bilateral
HA.
Thirty-one of the patients with MTLE
were diagnosed as having a mood disorder.
There were no statistically significant differ-
ences in age or duration of epilepsy between
patients with and without depression
(Table 1). Additionally, there was no differ-
ence in seizure frequency between the
depressed patients and those without
depression. Unsurprisingly, the difference
in BDI scores was statistically significant
with the highest scores observed in the group
with depression.
All but one patient used two or more
AEDs. Carbamazepine combination treat-
ments were the most commonly used thera-
pies (31/40 [77.5%] patients) and clobazam
in combination with carbamazepine was
used by 12/40 (30%) patients. Only 8/40
(20%) patients were receiving antidepres-
sant medications.
Of the 31 patients with mood disorders,
14 had dysthymia (ICD-10, F34.1), 11 had
recurrent depressive disorder (i.e., more
than two episodes with duration of at least
two weeks each and separated apart by more
than one month; ICD-10, F33), six patients
had bipolar disorder (ICD-10 F31), with
current depressive episode (ICD-10, F31.3).
Four patients in this last group had mild to
moderate depressive episodes [ICD-10
F31.3] and two had severe current depressive
episodes without psychotic symptoms [ICD-
10 F31.4]. Additionally, among the six
patients in the last group, five had suicidal
ideations but none had attempted suicide.

Correlations between BDI scores and
epilepsy duration (r ¼ 0.12) or between
BDI scores and seizure frequency (r ¼ 0.11)
were not statistically significant. In addition,
no significant difference was found between
patients with and without depression in the
presence or laterality of HA.
Of the 31 patients with depression, 17 had
left HA, nine right HA, three had bilateral
HA, (two predominantly left, one predom-
inantly right), and two patients had a
normal MRI scan. Of the 22/31 (71.0%)
cases with moderate to severe depressive
disorder, 12 patients had left HA (four had
major depressive disorder and eight had
moderate), eight patients had right HA and
two patients had normal MRI scans.
A large proportion 23/31 (74.2%) of
patients characterized as having a depressive
disorder had not been previously diagnosed.
Although 10/31 patients had previously
received antidepressants (some for migraine
and/or neuropathic pain) only 8/31 (25.8%)
patients had received antidepressants for
depression. Results showed that there had
been 4/10 suicide attempts (3 patients with
depression) and isolated suicidal ideation
occurred in 10/40 patients (nine patients
with depression).
Among the 40 patients involved in the
study, epilepsy occurred in family members
in 19 (47.5%) cases, alcoholism in 16
(40.0%) and mental disorders in 15
(37.5%). In addition, there were six (15%)
psychiatric hospitalizations among the
family members, three of which were for
suicide attempts. There was no difference
between patients with and without depres-
sion in the frequency of epilepsy or psychi-
atric history of family members.
Discussion
Accurate estimates of psychiatric comorbid-
ities are difficult,55 as most are based on
studies with considerable heterogeneity of
the variables and factors. A strength of this
current study was the use of relevant instru-
ments, especially the semi-structured psychi-
atric interview, which produced a reliable
diagnosis of the psychiatric comorbidity.
Based on our results and in accordance
with other studies4, the clinical presentation
of depressive disorders in epilepsy was simi-
lar to that of patients without epilepsy.
Interictal depression in epileptics is the
most common type of recognized mood
disorder and usually presents as a chronic
depression that more often than not tends to
mimic a dysthymic disorder with endogen-
ous features and an intermittent course.4 We
used reliable methods to categorize the
patients into the ICD-10 equivalent of
these disorders.
This current study showed a high fre-
quency (77.5%) of depressive disorders in
patients with pharmaco-resistant MTLE.
These findings are similar to several stu-
dies6,19,55 but higher than those found in
some reports.4,8,9,10,23,56 The difference in
results may be related to the severity of the
current study group; patients had severe
epilepsy and were candidates for epilepsy
surgery. Despite its relatively high preva-
lence, depression in patients with epilepsy
remains poorly recognized and without
adequate treatment.4 In this study, most
patients with major depressive disorder
(74.2%) had no previous diagnosis of the
condition and only 25.8% had been treated
with antidepressants.
In a preliminary study from our centre
involving 25 patients, we found that the
duration of epilepsy was significantly higher
in patients with a depressive disorder com-
pared with those without depression.57 In
this current study, the sample size was
increased to 40 patients but a correlation
between duration of epilepsy and depression
was not observed probably because most
patients had a mood disorder (i.e., 77.5%)
which skewed the sample population. In
addition, we found that there was no asso-
ciation between BDI and seizure frequency.

However, the relationship between depres-
sive disorders and severity of epilepsy is
considered controversial by several
authors.7,18,31,58
Evidence suggests a bi-directional rela-
tionship between depression and
MTLE22­25,37 and a study in patients with
MTLE has shown increased gray matter
atrophy in patients with depression com-
pared with those without depression.30 This
evidence suggests that common biological
factors may be related to both depression
and MTLE. Dysthymia was identified as the
most common depressive disorder in
patients with epilepsy (14/40, 35.0%), fol-
lowed by recurrent depressive disorder (11/
40, 27.5%). These findings are in accordance
with those of others who suggested that
dysthymia is the most common comorbidity
in patients with MTLE,4 In addition, we
found several patients (6/40, 15%) had a
bipolar disorder. A previous study found
that 11.8% of 143 adult patients with
epilepsy had bipolar disorder according to
DSM-IV critieira,59 and another study using
the MINI-Plus version detected 9.6% of 73
MTLE patients had bipolar disorder (80.8%
had refractory epilepsy).60 It is speculated
that refractory MTLE could be involved
with neuropathogenic mechanisms related
to depression25 and there could possibly be a
similar association between MTLE and
affective disorders.37
Further studies should be conducted to
understand the comorbidity of depression
with refractory MTLE because it is import-
ant to identify and provide adequate treat-
ment to prevent adverse consequences such
as suicide ideation and/or suicide attempts.
Importantly, suicide is two to five times
higher in patients with epilepsy than in the
general population.4,27­29,31­34 This rate is
even higher among patients with MTLE
(i.e., the risk is 25 times higher), rising in the
presence of a comorbid depressive disorder
to 32 times higher21,61 A high rate of suicide
attempts (10%) was observed in this study
which is in accordance with previous find-
ings.4,21,61 Clearly, untreated depression has
an important impact on patient's quality of
life and early diagnosis and adequate treat-
ment of depression may prevent brain dys-
function and assist in epilepsy improvement.
Similar to other studies,62,63 a high fre-
quency of epilepsy was found in the relatives
of patients (47.5%). The rates of familial
alcoholism and psychiatric disorders were
also high (40% and 37.5%, respectively). In
a previous study that involved 82 patients
with pharmacoresistant MTLE and 62 with
treatment-responsive MTLE, the presence
of family psychiatric history was more fre-
quent in pharmaco-resistant patients.64 In
this present study no differences was found
between patients with and without depres-
sion in the frequency of epilepsy or in
psychiatric family history. However, all
patients had refractory MTLE and the
number of patients without depression was
small. Indeed, a major limitation of this
study was the small sample size. However,
the overall results support the importance of
psychiatric evaluation in MTLE patients
with symptoms suggestive of mood dis-
orders, particularly in individuals with phar-
maco-resistance.
