Abstract
Objectives: To compare retrospectively serum levels of thyroid hormones (THs) and thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) between patients with biliogenic acute pancreatitis (BAP) and those
with hyperlipidaemic acute pancreatitis (HLAP), in order to assess their value for predicting the
severity of acute pancreatitis (AP).
Methods: Patients with AP were divided into BAP and HLAP groups, then further divided into
either a mild AP (MAP) group or a moderately severe AP (MSAP) group. Routine blood parameters
were measured. Free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and TSH levels were measured.
Results: Seventy-six patients with AP were enrolled in the study. FT3 and TSH levels were
significantly higher in patients with MAP than in patients with MSAP. FT4 and TSH levels were
significantly lower in the HLAP group than in the BAP group. TSH levels in both MAP and MSAP
patients were significantly lower in the HLAP group than in the BAP group. TSH was inversely
correlated with triglyceride levels in patients with HLAP. FT3 was a risk factor for MSAP in patients
with AP and also demonstrated moderate accuracy in predicting AP severity.
Conclusions: THs and TSH decrease with the severity of AP, especially in patients with HLAP. FT3
may be a useful biomarker for the early assessment of the severity of AP.

Introduction
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common serious
disorder characterized by the presence of
necroinflammatory changes in the pancreas
that can extend to extrapancreatic tissues,
with or without functional changes in other
organs.1 Severe AP cases are often asso-
ciated with severe complications and high
mortality, although mild AP cases can be
successfully managed by conservative meas-
ures.2 AP has diverse aetiologies, with bile
duct disease, alcohol and metabolic abnorm-
alities (e.g. hyperlipidaemia [HL]) being the
more common causes.3 Currently, biliogenic
AP (BAP) is the most common form of AP,4
while hyperlipidaemic AP (HLAP) repre-
sents a form of AP with a rising incidence
due to improvements in living standards and
changes in dietary habits.3­6 The underlying
causes of BAP may include sphincter of Oddi
dysfunction, inflammation, oedema and
obstruction of the periampullary duodenum
caused by common bile duct stones or a
periampullary diverticulum, which can cause
reverse flow of bile into the pancreas.3 In
addition, biliary tract infection and the spread
of inflammatory exudates into the pancreas
via lymphatic vessels may result.7 HLAP may
be related to injury to pancreatic acinar cells
and capillary endothelial cells induced by free
fatty acids (FFAs), which are the product of
triglycerides (TG), abnormal trypsinogen
activation and microcirculatory dysfunc-
tion.8­10 Since AP of different aetiologies
and severity may have different clinical out-
comes and require different treatment, assess-
ing disease severity is essential for selection of
the most appropriate initial treatment.11
The thyroid gland is an important part of
the endocrine system. Thyroid hormones
(THs) secreted by the thyroid gland, princi-
pally thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine
(T3), play important roles in regulating the
body's energy metabolism, promoting
growth, development and tissue differenti-
ation, and modulating islet function and
sugar, fat and protein metabolism.12 The
majority of circulating T4 and T3 is bound
to serum proteins and is largely biologically
inert; determination of the levels of biologic-
ally active free T3 and T4 can more accur-
ately assess the status of the thyroid gland.13
Since the secretion of THs by the thyroid
gland is regulated by many things, such as
the hypothalamic­pituitary­thyroid axis
and some pathological factors, serum TH
levels may be altered in many disorders.14
Nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) is a
state of adaptation or dysregulation of
thyrotrophic feedback control characterized
by unusual levels of THs (typically
decreased serum total T3 and FT3, increased
reverse T3, normal or reduced serum total
T4 and FT4, and normal or reduced serum
thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]); this
condition is often seen in starvation, mal-
nutrition, trauma, critical illness or in
patients admitted to intensive care units.15
NTIS has been associated with adverse
clinical outcomes and is one of the most
sensitive independent predictors of short-
term survival in hospitalized elderly
patients.16
Studies have shown that serum TH levels
undergo significant changes in AP patients
and return to normal as the condition
improves.17­20 In addition, serum TH levels
have been demonstrated to be able to assess
AP severity.17 However, it remains unclear
whether serum TH and TSH levels differ
between patients with AP of different
268 Journal of International Medical Research 44(2)
aetiologies, and whether serum TH and TSH
levels can be used to assess the severity of AP
in such patients. The present study aimed to
investigate possible differences in serum TH
and TSH levels between patients with BAP
and those with HLAP. The study also
assessed the value of serum TH and TSH
levels in predicting AP severity in patients
with BAP and HLAP.
Patients and methods
Patient population
This retrospective study enrolled sequen-
tial patients with AP who were sequen-
tially admitted to the Department of
Gastroenterology, Beijing Chaoyang
Hospital, Capital Medical University,
Beijing, China between January 2012 and
January 2013. The diagnosis of AP was
made when at least two of the following
three criteria were met: (i) classic abdominal
pain; (ii) elevation of amylase and/or lipase
three-times above the upper limit of normal;
(iii) evidence of acute pancreatitis revealed
by contrast-enhanced computed tomog-
raphy (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging or
abdominal ultrasound. HLAP was diag-
nosed in patients with AP when TG levels
exceeded 11.3 mmol/l or when TG levels
were 5.65­11.30 mmol/l, chylous serum was
observed, and other causes such as biliary
obstruction were excluded. BAP was diag-
nosed in patients with AP when biliary
obstruction was suspected according to bio-
chemical parameters or imaging findings
and confirmed by endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). AP
was classified by severity as mild acute
pancreatitis (MAP) or moderately severe
acute pancreatitis (MSAP), based on the
2012 Atlanta classification.20 MAP was
defined by the presence of clinical features
and biochemical changes typical of AP,
without organ failure, local or systemic
complications. MSAP was defined by the
presence of clinical features and biochemical
changes typical of AP, with transient organ
failure (spontaneously resolved in 48 h),
local complications or exacerbation of
comorbid disease (not spontaneously
resolved in 48 h). A diagnosis of fatty liver
was made when ultrasonography revealed a
`bright' liver with increased echogenicity, or
CT showed a lower density in the liver than
in the spleen. Patients with AP due to other
causes, such as ERCP or surgery, use of
anticoagulant drugs and chronic pancrea-
titis, and those with a previous history of
thyroid disease or diseases that could cause
abnormal TH were excluded. Patients who
were taking medications that may affect
thyroid hormone secretion and metabolism
(e.g. amiodarone) before enrolment were
also excluded.
This study was conducted according to
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the guidelines of the Ethics Committee
of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital
Medical University, Beijing, China. The
study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital
(no. 2012-ke-9) and written informed con-
sent was obtained from all patients.
Biochemical measurements
Venous blood samples (15 ml) were collected
from the cubital vein into VACUETTEÕ Z
Serum Clot Activator tubes (Greiner Bio-
One, Kremsmu
¨ nster, Austria) within 48 h of
hospital admission. The blood samples were
sent immediately to the hospital laboratory
for testing. Haematological parameters
including white blood cell count (normal
range, 3.97­9.15 Â 109/l), haemoglobin (Hb;
normal range, 131­172 g/l), haematocrit
(HCT; normal range, 38.0­50.8%) and
platelet count (PLT; normal range, 85­
303 Â 109/l) were measured using a Sysmex
XS-800i Automated Haematology Analyser
(Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). Liver and kidney
function, and lipid parameters, were
assessed using a DimensionÕ RxL MaxÕ
Yang et al. 269
integrated chemistry system (Dade-Behring
Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany). Measured
parameters included albumin (normal range,
32­55 g/l), alanine aminotransferase (ALT;
normal range, 10­40 U/l), aspartate trans-
aminase (AST; normal range, 10­42 U/l),
g-glutamyltransferase (GGT; normal range,
5­85 U/l), alkaline phosphatase (ALP;
normal range, 50­136 U/l), total bilirubin
(normal range, 3.4­20.5 mmol/l), direct biliru-
bin (Dbil; normal range, 0.0­6.8mmol/l), glu-
cose (Glu; normal range, 3.3­6.1 mmol/l),
calcium (Ca; normal range, 2.1­2.6mmol/l),
creatinine (Cr; normal range, 53­115mmol/l),
cholesterol (CHOL; normal range, 3.62­
5.70 mmol/l), high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (HDL-C; normal range, 1.03­
1.55 mmol/l), low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C; normal range, 1.81­3.36 mmol/
l) and TG (normal range, 0.56­2.26mmol/l).
Thyroid function parameters including free
T3 (FT3; normal range, 1.71­3.71pg/ml), free
T4 (FT4; normal range, 0.70­1.48 ng/dl) and
TSH (normal range, 0.35­4.94mIU/ml)
were measured using an ARCHITECT
i2000SR Immunoassay Analyser (Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 17.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Numerical data were expressed
as mean Æ SD and independent-samples
t-test was used to compare the means
between two groups. Categorical data were
compared using 2-test. The relationship
between two variables was evaluated using
Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis.
Logistic regression analysis was used to
assess the possibility of using THs and
TSH as risk factors for AP severity, and
their diagnostic performance was evaluated
using receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis, with sensitivity, spe-
cificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and
negative predictive value (NPV) being cal-
culated. P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Seventy-six patients with AP were included
in the study (54 men and 22 women) with a
mean Æ SD age of 49.5 Æ 16.4 years (range,
24­89 years). Patients' clinical characteris-
tics are presented in Table 1. There were 31
patients with HLAP (age range, 24­51
years) and 45 patients with BAP (age
range, 25­89 years). The mean age was
significantly lower and the proportion of
patients with fatty liver was significantly
higher in the HLAP group than in the BAP

two groups (Table 5). Serum levels of TSH
in MSAP patients were significantly lower in
the HLAP group than in the BAP group
(P ¼ 0.024), while serum levels of FT3 and
FT4 showed no significant between-group
difference (Table 5).
Correlations between serum FT3, FT4
and TSH levels and CHOL, HDL-C,
LDL-C and TG were analysed in all patients,
in patients with HLAP and in patients with
BAP. The results showed that serum TSH
levels were significantly inversely correlated
with TG in patients with HLAP (r ¼ À0.414,
P ¼ 0.021), but not in patients with BAP.
Logistic regression analysis was per-
formed to assess the possibility of FT3,
FT4 and TSH being risk factors for MSAP
in all patients with AP, in patients with
HLAP and in patients with BAP. Only FT3
was identified as a risk factor for MSAP. A
reduction in FT3 by one increased the risk of
MSAP by 12.05, 12.82 and 13.16 times in all
patients with AP, patients with HLAP and
patients with BAP, respectively (Table 6).
The value of FT3 in predicting the sever-
ity of AP was assessed using a ROC curve
analysis. The cut-off values, area under the
ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and
NPV in all patients with AP, in patients with
HLAP and in patients with BAP are shown
in Table 7.
Discussion
Serum levels of FT3 and FT4 have been
found to be reduced in patients with AP in
previous studies.17,18 One possible explan-
ation for this reduction in THs is cytokine
elevations caused by the inflammatory
response and endotoxins in AP. These can
alter serum TH levels directly or indirectly,
for example, by impairing the hypothal-
amic­pituitary­thyroid axis,21 reducing the
activity or release of TSH22­24, inhibiting the

synthesis or conversion of THs and regulat-
ing the protein binding of THs.22,25 An
increased level of tumour necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) has been found in patients with AP
and correlated with prognosis; TNF-a ele-
vation inhibits the stimulatory effect of TSH
on thyroglobulin production by thyroid
cells, and activation of adenylyl cyclase
and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) system.23,26,27 Interleukin (IL)-1,
IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-g levels are also
elevated in AP.28 IL-1 and IL-6 can inhibit
the release of iodinated THs, generation
of cAMP by thyroid cells, expression
of deiodinase mRNA, and activity of deio-
dinase.29­32 IFN-g inhibits thyrotropin-
induced thyroglobulin gene transcription
and generation of cAMP by thyroid
cells.33,34 In addition, this present study
found that patients with HLAP and patients
with BAP had significantly different serum
levels of FT4 and TSH.
Although both FT3 and FT4 levels may
decline in patients with AP,18 only FT3 was
found to be significantly lower in the MSAP
group compared with the MAP group in the
present study. This can be explained by the
impaired activity of hepatic thyroxine 5'-
deiodinase.17,35 Although both T3 and T4
can be secreted by the thyroid gland,$ 80%
of circulating T3 is produced from T4 via
deiodination (catalysed by 5'-deiodinase).36
Patients with AP often have concomitant
infections, and endotoxins produced by
bacteria enter the liver via the portal vein,
stimulate the activation of Kupffer cells,
cause lysosomal rupture and result in liver
necrosis.37 Biliary obstruction in patients
with BAP even aggravates liver necrosis.38
Conversely, various cytokines released
by inflammatory pancreatic tissue, such as
TNF-a, can also cause hepatic injury.21,23,24
As a result, activity of hepatic thyroxine
5'-deiodinase is impaired, and conversion
from T4 to T3 is affected, which may result
in the more significant decline of FT3 in AP
patients.25
Circulating T3/T4 can feed back to the
hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland
to negatively regulate thyrotropin releasing
hormone (TRH) and TSH release.39
However, serum levels of TSH were also
significantly decreased in the MSAP group
compared with MAP group in the present
study, despite the decline in FT3 levels. Since
TSH levels are regulated dually by THs and
TRH, the decline of TSH may be caused by
the impact of endotoxins and cytokines on
the hypothalamus and pituitary gland or the
altered response of the pituitary gland to
THs.21 The majority of critically ill patients
with infection have substantially elevated
catecholamine and glucocorticoid levels,
and often develop hypofunction of the
hypothalamus and pituitary gland, therefore
having a reduced release of TRH and
TSH.14,40
The present study found that serum levels
of FT4 and TSH were significantly lower in
the HLAP group than in the BAP group,
although FT3 levels showed no significant
between-group difference. In addition,
serum levels of TSH were inversely corre-
lated with TG in patients with HLAP, but
not in patients with BAP. These findings
suggest that HLAP and BAP may have a
different pathogenesis and clinical course.
HL can not only be the consequence of AP
but also it can be an independent factor
causing AP.5 Approximately 12­50% of
patients with AP had abnormal serum lipid
levels, and 1­12% of AP cases are caused by
HL.4,5 THs have diverse effects on lipid
metabolism, and hypothyroidism causes
hypercholesterolaemia.41 Previous studies
demonstrated that HLAP patients had sig-
nificantly elevated FFA levels and that FFA
levels were associated with AP severity.42,43
Interestingly, FFA levels are derived mainly
from TG-rich lipoproteins by lipolysis cat-
alysed by lipoprotein lipase.43 FFAs can
directly damage pancreatic acinar cells and
significantly inhibit the protein binding,
deiodination and conversion of THs.9,44

Therefore, the current study findings suggest
that patients with HLAP more easily
develop NTIS and have more significant
changes in TH levels, compared with
patients with BAP.
The present study demonstrated that
serum levels of FT3 and TSH were signifi-
cantly lower in patients with MSAP com-
pared with patients with MAP, in the overall
AP patient population and in the HLAP and
BAP groups, suggesting that serum FT3 and
TSH levels are associated with AP severity.
Studies have demonstrated that NTIS is
associated with nonthyroid disease sever-
ity.45,46 This present study further demon-
strated that the FT3 level was an
independent risk factor for MSAP. Given
that low FT3 and FT4 levels can reduce
oxygen and energy consumption, we suggest
that the decline of serum levels of FT3 and
FT4 may be a self-protective physiological
mechanism adopted by critically ill patients.
Consistent with this suggestion, it has been
observed that TH levels return to normal
when patients with NTIS recover.19
Currently, there is no evidence that hormone
replacement therapy can help patients
recover more rapidly.
The present study had several limitations.
First, the sample size was relatively small,
which might have resulted in insufficient
statistical power. Secondly, the mean age
was significantly lower in the HLAP group
than in the BAP group, and the confounding
effect of age could not be excluded. Thirdly,
patients with severe AP were not included in
this study as there were very few cases.
Finally, the timing of TH and TSH detection
may have an impact on the results.
However, due to the fact that the patients
were admitted at different times after the
onset of abdominal pain, TH and TSH levels
were measured as early as possible. In
addition, TH and TSH levels were only
measured once, and thus it was not possible
to assess whether THs and TSH had differ-
ent declining speeds between MAP and
MSAP patients. Future studies should care-
fully address these issues.
In conclusion, the present study demon-
strated that decreased TH and TSH levels
may be closely associated with AP severity.
The TH abnormality appears to be more
significant in patients with HLAP than in
patients with BAP. Detection of THs levels
in patients with early AP, especially HLAP
patients, may help predict disease severity,
select appropriate initial treatment and
improve prognosis.
