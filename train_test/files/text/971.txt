Objective: To test the hypothesis that the balance between fetal nutritional demand and maternal nutritional supply during
pregnancy will predict lipid profiles in offspring measured in adolescence.
Subjects and methods: A total of 296 male and 307 female Filipino offspring (aged 14­16 y) and mothers enrolled in a
longitudinal birth cohort study (begun in 1983­84) had lipid profiles measured. Data on maternal height (as a proxy for
offspring growth potential and thus fetal nutritional demand) and third trimester maternal arm fat area (as a proxy for maternal
supply) were used to create four groups hypothesized to reflect a gradient of fetal energy sufficiency.
Results: As fetal energy sufficiency increased among males, there was a decrease in total cholesterol (TC) (Po0.05 for trend),
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and the ratios of TC/HDL-C cholesterol and LDL-C/HDL-C (all Po0.001), while
HDL-C increased (Po0.05). Similar associations were identified when lipid levels were modeled as dichotomous `high-risk' cut-
points used in cardiovascular disease prevention in adolescents. These relationships were stronger, or only present, among
offspring of mothers in the lower half of the third trimester energy intake distribution, and were independent of the child's
current adiposity, dietary energy and fat intake, maturity, household income, and birth weight. In females, the supply­demand
model did not predict any lipid outcome or clinical risk criteria.
Conclusions: Our findings in males support the hypothesis that the balance between fetal nutritional demand and maternal
nutritional supply has implications for future lipid profiles. The lack of significant associations in females adds to mounting
evidence for sex differences in lipid metabolism programming, and may reflect sex differences in fetal nutritional demand.

Introduction
Risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular
mortality is elevated among individuals who were at the
lower end of the birth weight distribution (Barker et al,
1989). The prevailing hypothesis to explain these findings,
the `fetal origins hypothesis', is founded upon the observa-
tion that fetal nutrition is a key determinant of fetal growth
rate and thus assumes that birth weight functions as a
marker of fetal nutritional sufficiency (Barker, 1994, 1995).
According to this hypothesis, poor fetal nutrition forces the
fetus to slow its overall growth rate to conserve resources,
while relative adjustments in organ growth, hormonal set
points, and other physiologic responses boost immediate
survival. These responses, collectively described as `program-
ming', are viewed as permanent, and contribute to elevated
risk for CVD in postnatal life (Lucas, 1991).
While a growing number of studies have investigated
relationships between maternal nutritional status during
pregnancy and offspring CVD risk (Forsen et al, 1997;
Stanner et al, 1997; Roseboom et al, 2000; Adair et al, 2001;

Roseboom et al, 2001; Kuzawa & Adair, 2003), most tests of
the fetal origins hypothesis continue to use birth weight as a
marker of fetal nutritional sufficiency (Rasmussen, 2001).
Recent reviews present a strong rationale to question this
interpretation of birth weight (Godfrey & Robinson, 1998;
Waterland & Garza, 1999; Godfrey & Barker, 2000). A small
baby may have realized a lower growth potential with
adequate fetal nutrition (Chard et al, 1993). By the same
reasoning, a baby with a high growth potential may attain
an average or above-average birth weight despite growth
restriction, and be misclassified as having adequate growth.
While unquestionably complicating the interpretation of
birth weight, the normal population variability in fetal
growth potential also raises important questions about the
determinants of fetal nutritional sufficiency. For a fetus
aiming for a higher growth target, maternal supply must be
greater to avoid fetal nutritional insufficiency and the
metabolic and developmental adaptations that restrict
growth and elevate CVD risk after birth (reviewed by Godfrey
& Robinson, 1998). It follows that fetal nutritional suffi-
ciency and associated postnatal CVD sequelae are not a
simple product of the level of nutrition delivered by the
mother across the placenta, but the balance of maternal
supply relative to fetal demand (Figure 1). A complete test of
the fetal origins hypothesis would take both determinants of
fetal nutritional sufficiencyFmaternal supply and fetal
demandFinto account.
We use data collected prospectively in the Philippines over
a 17-y period to develop and test markers of maternal third
trimester nutritional supply (arm fat area) and fetal nutri-
tional demand (fetal growth potential as indexed by
maternal stature). Subjects are participants in a 1-y birth
cohort study who have been followed since the third
trimester of pregnancy and had lipid profiles measured
when they were 14­16 y of age. We have previously shown
that birth weight and maternal nutritional status during
pregnancy predict lipid profiles among the males in this
population, which is experiencing a rising burden of
cardiovascular disease (Kuzawa & Adair, 2003). Here we
tested the hypothesis that categorizing individuals based
upon the likelihood of having experienced energy shortfall
in utero, as indicated by different combinations of high and
low maternal supply and fetal demand, would predict lipid
profiles measured in adolescence.
Subjects and methods
Population and research design
Data come from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition
Survey (CLHNS), a community-based cohort study of
mothers and their infants born in 1983­84. Maternal
nutritional status and other characteristics were measured
during the third trimester of pregnancy (3072 weeks
gestational age). Mothers and offspring were then followed
prospectively from birth to the present. At the 1998­99
survey when cholesterol was measured, 2089 adolescents
aged 14­16 y were located and interviewed. Of these, 1969
had available measurements of birth outcomes, gestational
age, and current measurements, from which a subsample was
selected for blood sample collection. Twin pregnancies
(n ¼ 10) were excluded and the sample limited to term births
defined as a gestational age at birth Z37 weeks. The
population selected for blood draws was sampled at random
within two birth weight strata. To ensure adequate numbers
of lower birth weight individuals for an analysis of the effects
of fetal growth restriction on CVD risk (not presented here),
we oversampled individuals with birth weights equal to 2600
g or below. Final samples for the lipid analysis include
roughly 50% (154/316) of males and females with a birth
weight r2.6 kg and roughly 25% (449/1653) of individuals
with higher birth weight. We correct for this sample design
in the analysis (discussed below).
The potential for bias associated with attrition after the
baseline survey and selection of the subsample was assessed
in several ways. First, we compared birth characteristics of all
adolescents who were included in the 1998 follow-up with
those who were lost to follow-up. Mean birth weight of those
lost to follow-up was roughly 50 g less (Po0.05) than those
retained in the sample. This is most likely attributable to the
higher mortality rates among low birth weight infants. Birth
length did not differ significantly in the two groups. Those
lost to follow-up were more likely to have been urban
residents (82.5% urban vs 73.5% in the retained sample), but
there were no significant differences in household assets,
maternal education or maternal height, age or parity. Next,
we assessed potential biases in the subsample selected for
lipid analysis. Consistent with sampling design, females
included in the CVD study had significantly lower birth
weight, current height, and current weight (all Po0.05)
compared to those excluded, while these differences were

close to significant in males (Po0.07 for birth weight,
Po0.16 for height, and Po0.12 for weight). The lack of
significant differences in current anthropometrics among
the selected males was in large part due to the greater body
size variability in males. The absolute differences between
the selected and excluded subsets were quite similar among
males and females (eg for current weight, the selected female
and male subsets, respectively, were about 0.9770.44 and
0.6770.57 kg lighter than those excluded). There were no
differences between the included and excluded subsets in
current body mass index (BMI), skinfold thickness, house-
hold income, or dietary fat intake.
Diet, anthropometrics, and socioeconomic variables
Body weight, height, waist circumference, mid-upper arm
circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness were measured
in mothers and offspring using standard anthropometric
techniques (Lohman et al, 1988). BMI was calculated as the
ratio of weight (kg)/height (m2). Arm fat area was calculated
from triceps skinfold thickness and mid-upper arm circum-
ference (Frisancho, 1990). During the 1998­99 follow-up, the
child's dietary intake was measured using two 24-h recalls on
consecutive days. Mean macronutrient intakes from the 2
days were used in analyses. Energy and fat intake were
calculated using Philippines Food Composition Tables
produced by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of
the Philippines (Institute and Medicine, 1990). In females,
prospectively measured age at menarche was used to
construct a five-level maturational status variable. Among
males, maturational status was assessed by self-rated five-
level pubic hair staging, which was validated against
physician assessment (unpublished data). Although not
directly comparable with one another, the male and female
maturity scales were used to control for variation in
maturational status within each sex. When data were
collected for the 1998­99 survey, girls were completely
surveyed before boys. Consequently, boys are roughly 1 y
older than girls. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants, and all protocols were reviewed and approved
by Institutional Review Boards at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, with supplementary reviews by
boards at the Emory University Medical School and the
University of San Carlos in Cebu, Philippines.
Lipid profiles
For measurement of lipid profiles, participants were asked to
fast overnight for 12 h, and blood samples were collected in
clinics the following morning using EDTA-coated tubes.
After separation, samples were frozen and shipped on dry ice
to the Emory Lipid Research Laboratory (Atlanta, GA, USA)
for analysis of lipid profiles. All samples remained frozen at
À801C until ready for analysis. Total lipids were determined
by enzymatic methods using reagents from Beckman
Diagnostics on the CX5 chemistry analyzer. High-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) were determined using the homoge-
neous assay direct HDL-C and direct LDL-C (Equal Diagnos-
tics, Exton, PA, USA). Total cholesterol (TC) was determined
with an enzymatic kit, while triacylglycerol (TG) was
determined with a glycerol blank as a two-step reaction
(Beckman Coulter Diagnostics). The atherogenic ratios of
TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C were also calculated (Labarthe,
1998). The Emory Lipid Research Laboratory is a participant
in the CDC/NHLBI Lipid Standardization Program to ensure
accuracy and precision of the determinations.
Maternal nutritional supply
In selecting a measure of maternal nutritional supply, we
excluded maternal weight or body mass index, as these in
part reflect the weight of the feto-placental unit. Maternal
arm fat area (MAFA) measured during the third trimester of
pregnancy (3072 weeks of gestation) was deemed the most
appropriate index of maternal nutritional supply as it is a
marker of energy balance that is correlated with maternal
energy intake (r ¼ 0.2, Po0.00001) and relates positively to
offspring birth weight in this sample (Adair & Popkin, 1988).
Prior research in the Cebu sample has shown that third
trimester MAFA or the related measure of triceps skinfold
thickness is inversely related to offspring CVD risk as
indexed by lipid profiles (Kuzawa & Adair, 2003) and blood
pressure (Adair et al, 2001). We also use maternal third
trimester energy intake to validate our model.
Fetal nutritional demand
We use maternal height as a marker of fetal growth potential
and thus fetal demand for nutrients. Of the candidate
variables at our disposal, mother's height is among the
strongest established predictors of birth weight (Institute of
Medicine, 1990) and, compared to other measures of
maternal body size, is only weakly correlated with mother's
third trimester MAFA (r ¼ 0.18). We did not have paternal
height measurements available for this analysis. This
approach is similar to the use of adult height as an index
of fetal growth potential in prior fetal origins research (Leon
et al, 1996; Hennessy & Alberman, 1997). We assume that a
fetus born to a tall mother has, on average, a higher fetal
growth potential, thus requiring a greater supply of nutrients
to avoid nutritional insufficiency, growth restriction, and the
suite of adaptations that persist to elevate risk for CVD.
Constructing the four fetal energy sufficiency groups and
hypotheses
We first divided the population into high/low levels of fetal
demand based upon a median split (median ¼ 150.4 cm) of
maternal height (tall/short), and two levels of maternal
supply as indexed by a median split (median ¼ 12.2 cm2) of
high/low third trimester maternal arm fat area (HAFA/LAFA).

Next, we defined four groups representing the four possible
combinations of high/low supply and high/low fetal
demand (Figure 2). In our model, an individual born to a
tall mother with low energy status (Tall-LAFA) has a high
fetal demand for nutrients (high growth potential) but a
mother with a poor capacity to supply these needs as
indicated by her energy stores (LAFA). Thus, offspring of
Tall-LAFA mothers are predicted to have highest CVD risk. By
the same logic, the offspring of short but well-nourished
mothers (Short-HAFA) are predicted to have lowest risk of
fetal energy shortfall and thus lowest postnatal CVD risk.
The two intermediate risk groups (high demand/high
supply and low demand/low supply) have an associated
level of hypothesized CVD risk that is more ambiguous.
While our results are very similar when the two intermediate
risk groups are pooled (data not shown), we retained these
groups as separate in our analyses to illustrate both the
independent and combined effects of MAFA and maternal
height. Under the assumption that MAFA is a better index of
maternal supply than is mother's height as a marker of fetal
growth potential, we expected the group born to Short-LAFA
mothers to have higher risk than those born to Tall-HAFA
mothers. We thus hypothesized that the four groups would
represent the following gradient of fetal energy sufficiency
and associated reduction in CVD risk in adolescence: Tall-
LAFA o Short-LAFA o Tall-HAFA o Short-HAFA. To allow
trend tests in regression models, we defined a four-level
ordinal variable (`fetal energy sufficiency') based upon this
hypothesized gradient of fetal energy sufficiency, with
Tall-LAFA ¼ 1, Short-LAFA ¼ 2, Tall-HAFA ¼ 3, and Short-
HAFA ¼ 4:
Lowest energy sufficiency Highest energy sufficiency
1 2 3 4
Tall-LAFA Short-LAFA Tall-HAFA Short-HAFA
To validate our hypothesis that this four-level variable
reflects a gradient of fetal energy sufficiency, we further
divided the population based upon a median split of
maternal third trimester energy intake. We hypothesized
that the gradient in CVD risk across fetal energy sufficiency
levels would be stronger, or only present, among offspring of
mothers with lower third trimester energy intake.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed with version 8 of the Stata
Statistical Package (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas,
USA). In order to get an unbiased estimate of distributional
characteristics (eg mean LDL-C or dietary energy intake of
children), we weighted the observations such that both birth
weight strata would be represented in the estimate in
proportion to their occurrence in the population. Probability
sampling weights (pweights) for each strata were calculated
as the inverse of the within-strata sampling fraction (see
above), and the svymean procedure of STATA used to
estimate distributional characteristics. For all analyses, a P-
valueo0.05 was considered a statistically significant rela-
tionship with po0.10 noted as a statistical trend.
We tested the hypothesis that our four-level ordinal fetal
energy sufficiency variable would be inversely related to
CVD risk in offspring, as indicated by circulating concentra-
tions of each lipid and the two atherogenic ratios of Total/
HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C. To clarify the clinical significance
of these relationships, we also calculate the prevalence and
odds ratios (ORs) for members of each fetal energy suffi-
ciency group being classified as `high risk' for each lipid
outcome, using clinical cut-points developed for use in
adolescents (Kwiterovich, 1991). In this analysis, we also
calculate a summary risk index reflecting the total number
of high risk lipid values for each individual (possible score of
0­6). Diet and adiposity measures and HDL-C and TG were
log-transformed to approximate normal distributions before
regression analysis.
For each lipid outcome, we first test for significant trends
across levels of fetal energy sufficiency, indicated by the
significance of the beta coefficient for the four-level ordinal
variable in univariate regression models (linear regression for
mean values, logistic regression for clinical cutpoints, and
ordered logistic regression for the summary risk index). For
each lipid outcome, we ran a series of regression models to
determine the degree to which any relationships with fetal
nutritional sufficiency were independent of potential con-
founders and the child's weight at birth. We first report a
univariate model relating each lipid to the four-level ordinal
fetal energy sufficiency variable alone. In model 2 we adjust
for factors that might confound associations with prenatal
variables, including the adolescent's current adiposity,

energy and fat intake, maturational status, and household
income quartile measured at birth and at the age of
cholesterol measurement. In model 3, we further adjust for
birth weight to assess the degree to which any relationships
between fetal energy sufficiency and lipids are independent
of birth outcome.
For the purpose of evaluating whether the oversampling of
individuals with a birth weight r2.6 kg in our sample might
bias the conclusions drawn from our models, in model 3, we
also substituted a categorical variable (r2.6 and 42.6 kg) for
the continuous birth weight measure. By assessing any
change in the beta coefficients for the energy risk variable
before and after inclusion of birth weight strata variable, we
were able to assess whether fetal energy sufficiency­lipid
relationships are biased due to over-representation of
individuals with a birth weight of 2.6 kg or below. Consistent
with our prior work in this sample (Kuzawa & Adair, 2003),
sensitivity analyses for all models showed that including the
variable reflecting sampling design had negligible effect on
the estimates, precision, or significance of regression coeffi-
cients for the fetal energy sufficiency variable (not reported).
As the fetal energy sufficiency­lipid relationships that we
document are independent of low birth weight status, we
concluded that they are not biased by over-representation of
low birth weight individuals in our sample.
Our prior work in this population revealed highly
significant sex differences in the association between
prenatal factors and later lipid profiles and blood pressure
(Adair et al, 2001; Kuzawa & Adair, 2003). Therefore, all
models were stratified on sex.
Results
Obesity was nearly absent in the population and the
participants had relatively low dietary fat intake (Table 1).
There were significant trends for many of the dietary,
anthropometric, and socioeconomic variables across the
four levels of fetal energy sufficiency. At baseline, the
pregnant mothers were marginally nourished as indicated
by low energy intake and low mean body mass index
measured in the third trimester.

four levels of fetal energy sufficiency. Lipid values in this
population are within the range of values reported for
adolescent populations. For instance, in Taiwan, male and
female adolescent had total cholesterol values of 151.5 and
164 mg/dl, respectively (Chu et al, 1998), while the
corresponding values of US males and females were 158
and 161.4 mg/dl (Hickman et al, 1998).
In unadjusted male data (model 1), there were significant
trends across fetal energy sufficiency levels in LDL-C, HDL-C,
and the ratios of TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C. The trends
were in the direction predicted by the supply­demand
model, with CVD risk most elevated among groups classified
as high risk for prenatal energy shortfall. Adjusting for the
child's adiposity, maturity, energy and fat intake, and
household income (birth and 1998) strengthened associa-
tions with fetal energy sufficiency, while further adjustment
for birth weight (model 3) had negligible effect on any of
these models. In contrast to the males, there were no
significant differences in any lipid outcome between the
four levels of the fetal energy sufficiency variable in females,
whether tested as a trend across the four-level ordinal
variable (regression) or as multiple comparisons between
individual fetal energy sufficiency levels (Bonferonni-cor-
rected ANOVA).
We tested comparable multivariate regression models
stratified on lower (kJo5710/day) and upper (kJ ¼ 5710/
day) halves of maternal energy intake during the third
trimester of pregnancy (Table 4). The relationships between
fetal energy sufficiency and cholesterol levels were only
present, or considerably stronger, among male offspring of
mothers with lower energy intake during pregnancy. There
were no significant lipid trends across fetal energy suffi-
ciency levels in the females stratified on maternal energy
intake (data not shown).
To assess the clinical significance of the associations,
Table 5 presents the prevalence of males categorized as `high
CVD risk' for each lipid using clinical cut-points developed
for use in CVD prevention in adolescents (Kwiterovich,
1991). The tables also report ORs for each level of fetal
energy sufficiency (entered as dummy variables) from
multivariate logistic regression models predicting each
high-risk cut-point, using the highest fetal energy sufficiency
group (Short-HAFA) as reference group, and controlling for
adiposity, maturity, dietary energy and fat intake, and
household income at birth and at present. In females,
neither birth weight nor any fetal energy sufficiency group
had a significant OR for any clinical CVD risk cut-point
whether modeled as crude associations, or controlling

for confounders or birth weight (P-values ranging from 0.3 to
0.9 for trend tests). We therefore report results for males only.
For each lipid, the percentage of males considered to be ``at
high CVD risk'' decreased significantly as fetal energy
sufficiency increased; that is, for all five of the cholesterol
outcomes, a higher proportion of males were at high CVD
risk in the Tall-LAFA group compared to the Short HAFA
group. Intermediate levels of fetal energy sufficiency were
associated with intermediate ORs for high CVD risk in
adolescence. Consistent with these individual models, the
summary index (sum of all high-risk lipids) decreased in
dose­response fashion across fetal energy sufficiency groups
in males. In a multivariate logistic regression model that
included only control variables, birth weight was only
related to risk for high LDL-C in adolescence (OR [95%
CI] ¼ 0.38 [0.03, 0.73] for each 1 kg change in birth weight,
P ¼ 0.043), a relationship unchanged after inclusion of the
fetal energy sufficiency group variable (OR [95% CI] ¼ 0.39
[0.2, 0.76], P ¼ 0.051).

tions of high and low fetal nutritional demand (growth

potential as indicated by maternal stature) and high and low
maternal nutritional supply capacity (maternal energy
status), would predict CVD risk among a population of
adolescent Filipinos. Our expectations were confirmed in
males but not females. Male adolescents who had a high fetal
demand for nutrients who were born to mothers who had
poor energy status during pregnancy have the highest risk
for CVD as adolescents, as indicated by five of six of the lipid
outcomes investigated. As the likelihood of having experi-
enced energy shortfall in utero decreased across the four-
level supply­demand variable, the levels of TC and LDL-C
decreased while HDL-C increased. As a result of these
opposing trends, fetal energy sufficiency was strongly
inversely associated with the atherogenicity of the lipid
profile as indicated by the ratios of TC/HDL-C or LDL-C/
HDL-C. These associations were independent of potential
confounding factors and were only present, or strongest,
among offspring of mothers in the lower half of the
distribution of dietary energy consumption during preg-
nancy. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis
that the balance between fetal demand for nutrients and the
maternal capacity to supply these needs has persistent effects
on male offspring lipid metabolism.
The supply­demand model developed here is an extension
and refinement of our prior work in this population, which
illustrated the importance of MAFA alone as a predictor of
offspring male lipids (Kuzawa & Adair, 2003). The gradient in
lipid profiles across the four-level fetal energy sufficiency
variable (ie Table 5) illustrates the utility of considering both
MAFA and maternal stature simultaneously. In the present
analyses, male offspring of both low MAFA groups have
significantly elevated risk for developing future CVD com-
pared to the reference group born to well-nourished but
short mothers. However, offspring of low MAFA-Tall mothers
were significantly more likely to be classified as `high CVD
risk' for five lipid outcomes (all but TG), while the offspring
of low MAFA-Short mothers were only at increased risk for
low HDL-C and high LDL-C/HDL-C, with an additional
borderline-significant relationship with high TC. Thus, even
within MAFA strata, information on mother's height pro-
vides a refined basis for identifying males at risk for CVD. We
believe that this finding is consistent with our hypothesis
that fetal demand for nutrientsFas indicated here by
maternal statureFis a variable in its own right, and one
with independent effects on the balance of fetal nutritional
sufficiency.
Recent commentaries emphasize that the fetal environ-
ment is likely to have a minor influence on cardiovascular
risk and mortality (Kramer, 2000). Our findings in males
suggest that this assessment may be premature, and a
reflection of the widespread use of birth weight as a marker
of fetal nutritional sufficiency. While weight at birth had
little relevance to future lipid profiles in this population, the
supply­demand model predicted multiple clinical criteria of
high-risk lipid profiles in males. As has been noted
previously for relationships between maternal nutrition or
nutritional status during pregnancy and offspring CVD risk
factors (Roseboom et al, 2000; Adair et al, 2001), the fetal
energy sufficiency variable predicted lipids independent of
birth weight. Compared to the group with highest energy
sufficiency, males in the lowest energy sufficiency group
were about five times more likely to have a level of LDL-C or
TC defined as `high risk' for cardiovascular disease. The
lowest energy sufficiency group was also roughly three times
more likely to have low levels of beneficial HDL-C, and was
five times more likely to have an elevated atherogenic ratio
of LDL-C/HDL-C. These findings suggest that fetal nutri-
tional sufficiency, if modeled appropriately, may have great-
er clinical relevance than suggested by studies that use birth
weight as a proxy for fetal nutrition.
Sex differences in lipid programming: hypotheses
The consistency of the findings in males is striking in light of
the absence of any significant relationship in females. While
support for our model would be stronger if results were also
significant in females, these sex differences were not
unexpected in light of past research. Our prior work in this
population has identified inverse relationships between
birth outcomes or maternal nutritional status during
pregnancy and offspring lipids (Adair et al, 2001; Kuzawa &
Adair, 2003), blood pressure (Adair et al, 2001), and an
interaction between birth length and postnatal growth as an
influence on blood pressure (Adair & Cole, 2003) that were
only present among males. Based on human epidemiological
(Valdez et al, 1994; Donker et al, 1997; Antal et al, 1998;
Suzuki et al, 2000; Ziegler et al, 2000; Stein et al, 2002) and
animal model research (Lucas et al, 1996; Kind et al, 1999),
evidence for lipid programming is commonly stronger, or
only present, in males. Thus, rather than discounting our
model, we feel that our findings add to mounting evidence
for sex differences in the process of cardiovascular program-
ming, particularly of lipid metabolism.
While no model has been proposed to account for sex
differences in cardiovascular programming, the supply­
demand model suggests one possible interpretation of these
findings. Sexual dimorphism in growth rate begins before
birth, and is reflected in the common finding of higher mean
birth weight and length among male compared to female
newborns (Hindmarsh et al, 2002). The greater nutritional
demands of the male fetus may render it more precariously
balanced nutritionally, and more vulnerable to disruptions
in supply. For instance, in rats, surgical reduction in uterine
blood flow alleviates the normal sexual dimorphism in size
at birth (Oyhenart et al, 1998; Dressino et al, 2002). A
heightened sensitivity of male fetuses to maternal nutrition
is suggested in humans by the finding in some studies that
nutritional supplementation of poorly nourished mothers
disproportionately improves male birth weight (Mora et al,
1979; Adair & Pollitt, 1985), and that male embryos or
fetuses suffer higher pregnancy losses under conditions of
maternal undernutrition (Andersson & Bergstrom, 1998). If

the greater male sensitivity to prenatal nutrition or stress
(Stinson, 1985) manifests as sex differences in postnatal lipid
profiles or CVD risk, sex differences might be accentuated in
this population owing to the marginal nutritional status of
the mothers during pregnancy.
Sex differences in lipid programming may also reflect
programming of the hypothalamic­pituitary­gonadal axis,
which is known to have lasting influence on sex steroid
metabolism (Rhind et al, 2001). Males experience a prenatal
and early postnatal surge in testosterone that `androgenizes'
various target tissues, organs, and endocrine axes, altering
their sensitivity and developmental response to the rise in
testosterone production initiated at puberty (Forest, 1983).
Fetal testosterone production, in turn, is sensitive to
maternal nutrition (Rae et al, 2002) and stress (Ward &
Weisz, 1980; Williams et al, 1999). Given the importance of
the pubertal rise in androgen production to the establish-
ment of the male-typical adult lipid profile (Berenson et al,
1981), any long-term effects of the intrauterine milieu on sex
steroids or steroid-sensitive target tissues, such as liver
enzymes (Gustafsson & Stenberg, 1974), could influence
adult lipid profiles in males. Such dual `organizational' and
`activational' effects of androgens are well established for
numerous tissues and organs (Rhind et al, 2001).
Importance of fetal growth potential
Our results add to a small but growing list of `fetal origins'
studies that attempt to account for variation in fetal growth
potential. Prior work has used indices of fetal growth
potential in combination with birth outcomes as a basis for
assessing the sufficiency of growth in utero. Leon et al (1996)
and Hennessy and Alberman (1997) found that inverse
relationships between birth weight and blood pressure were
strongest among individuals who ended up taller as adults.
Based upon the assumption that small size at birth in a tall
adult is an indication that growth potential was not attained
in utero, both authors interpret their findings as evidence
that failure to reach fetal growth potential may be critical to
blood pressure programming.
In contrast to this approach, our supply­demand model is
unique in operationalizing growth potential as an influence
on the fetus' risk of nutrient shortfall by determining its level
of nutritional demand. While genetics presumably play a
dominant role in setting the fetal growth trajectory,
epigenetic mechanisms of fetal growth restriction may also
be important. Given evidence that the fetal growth trajec-
tory may be reset in response to maternal nutrition or
hormonal cues during early pregnancy or the periconceptual
period (Godfrey & Robinson, 1998), growth restriction of
epigenetic origin might paradoxically protect the developing
fetus against nutritional insufficiency by lowering the level
of nutritional demand during later gestation. Current work
on parent of origin effects (imprinting) on IGF-II and a
related cluster of genes suggests a possible epigenetic basis
for separate regulation of fetal demand and maternal supply,
manifesting as differential expression of fetal growth-pro-
moting and placental-supply limiting genes in the fetus and
placenta (Reik et al, 2003). Our results, along with evidence
for sex differences in the transgenerational effect of maternal
constraint on birth weight (Price & Coe, 2000), suggest that
these processes may vary in important ways in males and
females.
Limitations of study
Although prospectively collected data are a strength of our
study, we were forced to rely on imperfect measures of both
fetal growth potential and maternal supply capacity. The
mothers in the Cebu sample have low mean stature relative
to Western standards, which is presumably a reflection, in
part, of poor postnatal nutrition and unattained growth
potential (Siega-Riz & Adair, 1993). This is likely to reduce,
but not abolish, the utility of maternal stature as a marker of
offspring growth potential. While maternal stature was the
most appropriate measure of fetal growth potential available
for our sample, prior research has used offspring adult stature
(Leon et al, 1996; Hennessy & Alberman, 1997) and mother's
own birth weight (Skjaerven et al, 1997) to similar effect. Our
model should be viewed as a preliminary attempt to
incorporate variation in fetal nutritional demand into the
study of the fetal origins of adult disease.
Similar limitations apply to our measure of maternal
supply capacity, as obstructed substrate flow to the fetus
secondary to maternal hypertension, placental insufficiency,
or other factors may compromise fetal nutrition indepen-
dent of maternal nutrition and nutritional status (Harding,
2001). We were not able to control for these additional
influences on maternal supply capacity. The changes in
adipose tissue stores that occur during pregnancy, and the
interindividual variability in this process, complicate our
interpretation of MAFA. The women in the Cebu sample
were marginally nourished during pregnancy, as indicated by
low energy intake and a third trimester BMI of roughly 23
kg/m2. It is thus of interest that the relationships between
the fetal energy sufficiency variable and lipids in male
offspring were stronger, or only significant, among mothers
with below-median energy intake during pregnancy. This
strengthens our interpretation that nutritional insufficiency
is related to the observed results. The utility of MAFA as a
functional measure of maternal supply may have been
accentuated by the marginal nutritional status of the women
in the sample, and by the fact that it was measured at a mean
gestational age (3072 weeks) just prior to peak energetic
demands of pregnancy and fetal fat deposition (King,
2000). Our model may prove most useful in populations
experiencing a similar level of energetic and nutritional
restriction.
As we are using maternal anthropometric characteristics to
predict offspring lipid profiles, we are unable to rule out
confounding of the associations by shared genes or features
of environment. However, we feel that this an unlikely

explanation for our findings in males. If the associations
between fetal energy sufficiency categories and later lipids
were the result of shared genetic or lifestyle factors, we would
expect the offspring of mothers with greater adiposity to
have higher cholesterol. This is the opposite of the observed
trend in males. Indeed, it is the nonintuitive association
between high offspring cholesterol and low maternal
adiposity, especially in combination with low maternal
energy intake, that makes it unlikely that our findings are
merely due to offspring resembling their mothers. However,
these associations are in agreement with the predictions of
the fetal origins hypothesis.
In conclusion, our findings in males highlight the
potential benefits of considering variation in fetal demand
for nutrients in tests of the fetal origins hypothesis, as a
complement to current research focused on factors influen-
cing the supply of nutrients to the fetus. Among males, the
supply­demand model developed here predicted mean levels
and clinical cut-points for five of six lipid outcomes
investigated. Lipid risk factors for development of athero-
sclerosis were most elevated among offspring of taller
mothers with low adipose tissue stores, and these associa-
tions were strongest when the mothers consumed below-
median dietary energy during pregnancy. In contrast, the
supply­demand model did not predict any lipid outcome or
clinical cut-point among females. We speculate that sex
differences in the level of fetal nutritional demand, or sex
steroid programming, may help explain these differences.
