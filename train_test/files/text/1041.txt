Survey evidence through the early 1990s generally suggests a
reduction in disability in the elderly population of the United
States. Because the evidence is not fully consistent, several authors
have speculated about whether disability declines will continue.
This paper reports results from the 1999 National Long-Term Care
Survey on disability trends from 1982 through 1999. It is found that
disability continued to decline in the 1994 to 1999 period, and that
the decline was greater in the 1990s than in the 1980s. The
disability decline from 1982 to 1989 was 0.26% per year, from 1989
to 1994 it was 0.38% per year, and from 1994 to 1999 it was 0.56%
per year. In addition, disability declined by a greater percentage for
blacks than for nonblacks over the 1989 to 1999 period.
Declines in chronic disability over time can have major
implications for fiscal stability of Medicare and Social
Security programs. Documented chronic disability declines
among the U.S. elderly population between 1982 and 1994 led to
projections about the positive consequences of continued and
even accelerating declines. The purpose of this paper is to use the
recently available data from the 1999 round of the National
Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) to assess whether accelera-
tion in the decline in chronic disability actually occurred. In
addition, we assess whether the increase in chronic disability
among elderly black Americans observed between 1982 and 1989
has continued, or possibly whether there has, more recently,
been a decline in chronic disability within this group as well.
Chronic disability prevalence in the U.S. population aged 65
declined in the 1982 to 1989 NLTCSs (1). Those declines were
scrutinized by a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel.
That panel concluded that the declines in chronic (i.e., more than
90 days) disability were real but that the 1994 NLTCS would be
needed to (i) validate evidence of the decline, (ii) determine the
velocity of the decline, and (iii) determine the demographic (i.e.,
age, gender, race) and disability composition of the decline (2).
The 1994 NLTCS confirmed that the 1982 to 1989 declines in
chronic disability continued to 1994 (3). The 1994 NLTCS also
showed declines were larger for persons age 85 and for both
serious [i.e., activities of daily living; ADLs (4)] and less serious [i.e.,
instrumental activities of daily living; IADLs (5)] impairments.
Whereas the relative rate of decline 1982 to 1994 was 1.3%, that
decline accelerated from 1982 to 1989 (1.0%) to 1989 to 1994
[1.5%; standardized to the 1994 U.S. age distribution (3)].
In addition, a number of other national surveys provided
evidence of a disability decline in the elderly U.S. population.
Freedman and Martin confirmed the disability decline in the
1984 to 1993 Survey of Income and Program Participation (6).
The estimate of the decline (adjusted for population composi-
tion) in chronic disability from that survey (from 0.9% to 2.3%
per annum for each of four functions) was larger than observed
(1.3%) in the 1982 to 1994 NLTCS. As in the NLTCS, rates of
decline were most rapid at ages 85. Other researchers have
found a 0.7% per annum decrease in chronic disability (from
21.1% to 19.5%) in the 1982­1993 National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) (7, 8). Waidmann found evidence of the decline
of chronic disability in a variety of data sources, including the
NHIS, after correcting for problems in sample design and
instrument content (9). Waidmann and Liu (10) found evidence
of a decline in disability for persons aged 65 in the 1993 to 1996
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Freedman and Martin
(11) also found evidence of a decline in chronic disability in the
1984 and 1994­1995 Supplements on Aging to the NHIS.
Fogel and Costa, in several studies (12, 13), found long-term
declines in chronic morbidity in male Union Civil War veterans
aged 65 (birth cohorts of 1825 to 1844). They compared morbidity
recorded during a physician-conducted medical examination in
1910 (required to qualify for a federal pension) with medical
conditions reported by male World War II veterans aged 65 in the
1985 to 1988 NHIS. The 0.6% annual rate of decline in chronic
morbidity found by Fogel [which persisted over 75 years (12)] was
replicated by Costa for disability (14). Costa found a decline in
disability (loss of mobility functions) as reported by the Civil War
veterans in 1910 compared with males in the 1990 to 1994 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.
The declines in morbidity and disability observed by Fogel and
Costa were attributed to improvements in nutrition and to an
increased ability to resist bacterial diseases (12) and possible
chronic disease (organ failure) sequelae of those diseases (15­
19). A nutritional hypothesis was also promulgated by Perutz
(20), who found that British cohorts born after 1840 had a higher
rate of survival to ages 100 than in earlier cohorts. An
alternative explanation of these trends is that the improved
nutrition of mothers in the U.S. from 1825 to 1844 affected the
intrauterine environment in ways that changed diabetes, stroke,
and heart disease risks at late ages (21, 22). The fetal environ-
ment might also affect cancer risks in adults (23). It may even
affect the risk of organic brain syndromes (Zeng Yi, personal
communication).
The evidence led Fogel and Costa to posit a model of ``techno-
physiological'' evolution (13). This model argues that improvements
in health are too rapid to be caused by evolutionary (genetic)
changes. Rather, health changes must be caused by the evolution of
the technological environment of the individual--especially in the
technologies preserving health. This theory suggests that invest-
ment in health care technology and nutrition could preserve human
capital in the U.S. economy by allowing workers to continue being
productive at increasing ages (24).
The primary question addressed by the new 1999 NLTCS is
whether the decline in chronic disability accelerated as suggested
by social and economic correlates of the earlier disability de-
clines (25). Singer and Manton (26) found that a continuation of
the observed 1.5% relative decline (1989­1994) in disability
could preserve, in the long term (to 2070), the fiscal stability of

Medicare and Social Security Programs. These calculations
support the tenets of the theory of techno-physiological evolu-
tion (13). An acceleration of the decline would be expected from
the projected increase of the level of education (years of
schooling) in the very elderly U.S. population. Preston (27)
projected that the prevalence of persons with 8 years or less of
education at ages 85 to 89 would decline from 65% in 1980 to
15% in 2015. Manton and Corder (25) found that the rate of
chronic disability decline could be 2.2%, based on the relation
of years of school to disability level in the elderly population.
Below, we will determine whether the decline in chronic dis-
ability accelerated from 1994 to 1999 compared with 1989 to
1994, as well as whether the composition of the distribution of
disability changed. We will examine whether the trajectory of
change in disability differed for blacks and nonblacks 1982 to
1999. The analysis of blacknonblack differences in the rate of
change of disability 1994 to 1999 is of interest in that the 1982
to 1989 NLTCS showed a significant increase in chronic disability
for elderly black Americans (D. Clark and F. Wolinsky, personal
communication; refs. 28 and 29).
Data
The data examined are age-, sex-, and race-specific estimates of
the number of persons with chronic disability from the 1982,
1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999 NLTCS. Chronic disability rates were
calculated by using as denominators estimates of the size of the
population aged 65 at risk made from sample-weighted counts
of persons in each cell. Sample weights were calculated as the
inverse of the probability of sample selection. Thus our popu-
lation estimates, before any poststratification, are based on
internally consistent estimates derived only from information in
sample responses and the sample design (i.e., the pattern of the
probabilities of selection, and their inverses, provide the sample
weights to calculate population frequencies; see Census Bureau
Source and Accuracy Statement for 1999 NLTCS http:
www.cds.duke.edu). This procedure was important for estimat-
ing changes in the U.S. institutional population.
Other estimates of changes were made by examining the use of
nursing home beds by elderly persons in the 1985 to 1995 National
Nursing Home Surveys (NNHS). In the NNHS, reductions in
nursing home use occurred for all age groups above 65. They were
largest for persons older than 85. For the first time (1995) in the
NNHS's history black elderly nursing home use rates (4.52%) were
higher than for nonblacks (4.23%). Bishop (30) estimated that rates
declined 8.2%. Strahan (31) estimated that use declined 10.8%. In
the 1985 and 1995 NNHS there was a large decline in the number
of nursing homes (from 19,100 to 16,700) and in their occupancy
rate (from 91.8% to 87.4%). Changes were also observed in the size
and composition of the nursing home population by using the 1987
to 1996 Medical Expenditures Surveys (MEPS). While the 1985 and
1995 NNHS showed the number of nursing homes declined by
2,400, there was an increase in the MEPS of 2,790 institutions (i.e.,
from 14,050 in 1987 to 16,840 in 1996). This discrepancy occurred
even though the NNHS used a broader definition of nursing home
residence than MEPS, which would increase the estimated number
of nursing homes. In MEPS the occupancy rate fell (92.3% in 1987
to 88.8% in 1996). These findings suggest problems in using
institutional sample designs based on facility lists. In the NLTCS
this problem did not occur because our sampling unit is the
individual, and not the facility, so we can use Medicare adminis-
trative lists to generate our sample rather than rely on a facility list
verification procedure (32). In the NLTCS, we identify, using a
person-based list sample, persons in facilities by using nursing home
beds.
All five NLTCS samples were drawn from Medicare adminis-
trative records. This list sample frame maintained near-perfect
follow-up of persons across survey years (eliminating bias from loss
to follow-up). The sample design for the 1982 NLTCS was drawn,
using reduction sets of 5,000 persons, from 55,000 names drawn
from Medicare lists (see Census Bureau Source and Accuracy
Statement for 1982­1984 NLTCS located at http:www.cds.duke.
eduRESOURCE.HTML). A reduction set was the predefined
number of cases screened until a sufficient number of sets had been
processed to identify 6,000 chronically disabled persons to receive
detailed community interviews (the number budgeted for). This
process required interviewing seven reduction sets--35,000 per-
sons. The reduction set strategy was used because the prevalence of
chronic disability in the U.S. elderly community population in 1982
had not been previously estimated. In the 1982 NLTCS persons
were only identified as residents in institutions. That is, although the
institutional sample component was identified on the 1982 screen,
persons were not given detailed interviews. Institutionalized per-
sons did not receive a detailed interview until 1984. After 1982 a
sample of roughly 5,000 persons aged 65 to 69 was drawn from
Medicare lists to replenish the sample so it would represent the
entire U.S. population aged 65. In each survey year all persons
who received a detailed community or (after 1982) institutional
interview in a prior survey were given a detailed interview after
receiving a shortened screener.
In 1994 and 1999 NLTCS samples were supplemented three
ways. First, an over-sample of persons age 95 was drawn in 1994
(n  540) and 1999 (n  600) to improve the precision of estimates
for this extreme elderly population. Second, to improve estimates
made of the traits of nondisabled persons the sample receiving a
detailed community interview was augmented in 1994 by 1,762
persons designated to receive a community interview even though
they would not otherwise have received one based on their screen
interview (sample component H). In 1999, 1,262 of these persons
(``healthy'' in 1994) continued and were given a detailed interview
in the institution or community. In addition a sample of 283 healthy
(the H sample in 1999) persons was drawn from persons not
reporting disability in 1994 to replenish the 1994 healthy sample
supplement for mortality 1994 to 1999. The H samples in 1994 and
1999 are designed to improve estimates for nondisabled persons--
e.g., improve the precision of estimates of the prevalence of chronic
conditions in the nondisabled population.
In each survey year the sample averaged roughly 19,000 cases--a
total of 42,000 distinct individuals in all 5 years. In these 5 years,
26,735 detailed community interviews were conducted, along with
interviews of more than 7,000 persons in institutions. About 90,000
screens were conducted. The exact age at death of over 22,000
persons was determined for those who died (based on Medicare
records) between 1982 and 1999. Another important feature of the
NLTCS is its high response rates. The detailed interview response
rate in 1999 was the highest yet--97.6%. This high rate has
important implications for adjustments made to the survey for
poststratification weighting. The smaller the nonresponse rate the
less likely bias is to be introduced by poststratification weighting. An
area of potential concern is that certain groups, such as blacks, may
have higher nonresponse rates. If they have different true disability
rates this could lead to bias. The detailed interview response rates
for blacks is high (96.7%), which, with the small proportion of the
total sample they represent, suggests any bias is small.
The longitudinal sample of persons was linked to a continuous
history of Medicare service use from 1982 to 2000 derived from
administrative files. These data have become more detailed over
time as Medicare file systems were improved (especially in 1990),
information on health care services expanded, and the types of
Medicare services provided changed. Survey records were, for the
first time, linked to the ``Denominator'' file to identify elderly
persons served in Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility (TEFRA)
risk contracts--i.e., in health maintenance organizations (capitated
plans) reimbursed by Medicare a fixed amount per person [using
the adjusted average per capita cost (33)] rather than being
reimbursed for specific services used by each enrollee.

An important feature of the survey is that the instrument
content on chronic disability was preserved over all waves of the
NLTCS. Disability was assessed by using measures of chronic
(more than 90 days) disability based on ADLs (4) and IADLs (5).
The definition of institutional status was maintained with only a
small change made in 1989, and an additional type of residence
(i.e., assisted living) was added in 1999.
Results
In Table 1 we present chronic disability prevalence rates for each
NLTCS. Rates were standardized to the 1999 U.S. age distri-
bution. They are slightly different from rates in Manton et al. (3),
which were standardized to the 1994 population.
The prevalence of chronic disability declined 6.5%--26.2% to
19.7%--from 1982 to 1999. This is a relative decline of 25% over
17 years. On a per annum basis the rate of decline in prevalence
accelerated from 0.26% 1982 to 1989, to 0.38% 1989 to 1994, to
0.56% 1994 to 1999. The relative rate of disability decline increased
from 1.0% 1982 to 1989, to 1.6% 1989 to 1994, to 2.6% 1994 to 1999.
The 0.56% per annum decline 1994 to 1999 is consistent with the
0.6% historical annual rate of decline in chronic disability from 1910
to 1985 of ref. 14. The decline of 0.6% per annum is not surprising,
given the high level of disability in 1910. It is surprising, given the
low level of disability in 1994 (i.e., 22.5%), that the rate of
improvement (i.e., the velocity of the decline of chronic disability)
accelerated 1994 to 1999 (reaching 19.7%).
Standard errors of estimates were adjusted for design effects.
We used the generalized variance function (GVF) methods
developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1999 NLTCS (34).
These methods have been used in a number of other survey
analyses. They, in essence, involve regressing the sizes of pop-
ulations with a given trait on the variance estimated for that
population size. The variance used in the regression function is
adjusted for sample design effects (35). Specifically, the standard
error of an estimated total Y is predicted as
SEY  0
Y2  1
Y1/2.
The SE(Y) is the predicted standard error based on the regression
estimates 0
and 1
. The standard error for a proportion p is
S
x,p
 p1.0  p1
x,
where 1
is the regression estimate, x is the weighted population
(i.e., sum of sample weights), and p is the proportion for which
a standard error, S(x,p)
is desired. Estimates of the standard error
of a difference in two proportions using the GVF are

where  is the correlation of the proportions. If  is not generally
available it can be conservatively assumed to equal zero (36).
Changes in chronic disability prevalence 1982 to 1999 were
significant at the 0.05 level or better. The t statistic for the decline
in disability was 15.2, which was significantly different from a
hypotheses of no change beyond the 0.001 level. t statistics were
calculated in several ways (e.g., by using GVF). The sample design
effects did not vary enough over individuals to significantly alter the
t-statistic computations. When levels of disability are examined,
only the prevalence of persons with 3 or 4 ADLs impaired increased
1982 to 1999. All other disability levels decreased significantly.
There were large declines 1982 to 1999 of 38.2% (from 6.8% to
4.2%) for persons in institutions and 43.9% (from 5.7% to 3.2%) for
persons with IADL impairments. What may underlie these changes
is that the proportion of the population with chronic impairments
that best respond to instrumentalities (e.g., changes in the built
environment--IADL-only impairments and persons in institutions)
declined most rapidly.
To interpret these changes we observe that a number of chronic
degenerative diseases had a slower rate of progression, or a lower
rate of occurrence, 1982 to 1999. Severe dementia, a condition
generating significant chronic impairment, declined 33.3% [from
5.7% (age adjusted) in 1982 to 3.8% in 1994 (37)]. If this decline
continued to 1999 (a hypothesis to be tested) the prevalence of
severe dementia in 1999 would be 2.8%--or a million fewer than
expected from the 1982 rates. This would be a reduction of 200,000
persons from what would have occurred if prevalence had remained
at 3.4% in 1999 (i.e., 1.2 million persons with severe dementia).
Other chronically disabling diseases such as stroke and certain types
of heart disease also showed large declines (38). Declines in these
conditions suggest declines in nursing home use.
The implications of this decline for the size of the chronically
disabled U.S. elderly population in 1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, and
1999 are in Table 2.
The chronically disabled population age 65, after age stan-
dardization, was 7.1 million in 1982. It would have been 9.3
million (2.3 million; 32.4%) in 1999 if the 1982 age- and
disability-specific rates had not declined. The observed number
of chronically disabled persons in 1999 was 7.0 million--2.3
million persons less than would have occurred if rates had not
changed 1982 to 1999. The size of the disabled elderly population
decreased absolutely, from 7.5 million in 1994, to 7.0 million in
1999. The decline of 6.7% in the number of disabled persons
1994 to 1999 can be compared with an increase of 5.5% (0.39
million) in the number of disabled persons from 1982 to 1994
despite the decline in disability prevalence. There was a large
absolute decline (415,000 persons) in the institutional population
1994 to 1999. The NNHS suggested that the institutional pop-
ulation would increase from 1985 to 1995 (33). A decline in
nursing home use, after age standardization, both absolutely
(22.0%) and relatively (26.3%) was not anticipated. Major new
types of institutional residence (i.e., assisted living) emerged.
An important dimension of the chronic disability decline
changes among black Americans 1982 to 1999 in Table 3.
There are sizable increases in chronic disability prevalence for
black Americans 1982 to 1989 (see ref. 29). Chronic disability
prevalence increased 0.21% per year for black Americans although,
because of small samples, the standard error of the increase is large.
From 1989 to 1994 disability declined 0.96% per year ­ with a larger
decline of 1.2% in 1994 to 1999. The 1989 to 1994 declines are highly
significant. Thus, examination of disability declines from 1982 to

1994 shows a significant overall decrease in disability because of the
improvement of 4.7% from 1989 to 1994. From 1994 to 1999 the
estimated decline (5.9%) in disability prevalence was even larger for
black Americans than for 1989 to 1994. Declines 1994 to 1999 in
chronic disability are likely larger for black than for nonblack
Americans, although estimates for blacks have poor precision.
Additional factors of concern in interpreting the estimates for
blacks is a somewhat lower response rate for blacks and the effects
of positive undercounts of blacks in the 1990 Census used to project
the 1999 black population estimates.
Despite the faster improvement for black Americans 1989 to
1999, there remains a diminished, but significant, deficit (5.0%) for
elderly blacks, i.e., they still have a higher prevalence of disability.
In contrast to the 1985­1995 NNHS, blacks in the NLTCS do not
have a higher rate of use of nursing homes than nonblacks.
Nonblack use of nursing homes declined faster than for blacks.
Temporal trends of education (years of schooling) are in
Table 4.
There is a large increase in the number of years of schooling
completed by blacks and nonblacks. The proportion with 8 years or
less of schooling declined 34.6% for blacks and 27.5% for non-
blacks. Thus there is a larger absolute decline in the less educated
proportion of the U.S. elderly black, vs. nonblack, population.
The proportion of blacks versus nonblacks with no more than
8 years of schooling increased from 1982 to 1989 (i.e., from
28.9% to 30.8%). From 1989 to 1994 the average education level
for blacks improved relative to nonblacks (i.e., from a 30.8%
difference in 0 to 8 years of schooling for 1989 to 28.4% for
1994). The relative improvement was faster 1994 to 1999 (i.e., a
difference of 28.4% in 1994 declining to 21.8% in 1999).
The educational level reflecting the most improvement was
the proportion of blacks with 9 to 12 years of schooling. The
deficit decreased from 18.1% in 1989 to 1.8% in 1999. The large
differential in the proportion of blacks with less than 8 years of
schooling suggests that there is room for further improvement
attributable to potential increases in education for blacks.
Black and nonblack disability trends are presented for ages
65­74, 75­84, and 85 in Table 5.
At ages 65­74, declines in the proportion disabled for blacks
show larger declines than for nonblacks. There was more im-
provement in blacks' disability rates for up to 12 years of
education than for nonblacks.
Discussion
Three major findings are (i) an acceleration of the decline in chronic
disability prevalence from 1994 to 1999 compared with 1989 to
1994, (ii) the large relative and absolute drop in institutional use,
and (iii) disability decline for black Americans after 1989.
The rapid decline in chronic disability prevalence is significant for
several reasons. First, Singer and Manton (26) showed that a
relative rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum in chronic
disability could ensure the long-term fiscal solvency of the Medicare
and Social Security programs. The Social Security Trustees showed
the marginal tax rate increase necessary to maintain Medicare
solvency declined to 1.21% (from 1.46% in 1998 (39, 40) and that,
for the first time, there was an actual (not discounted by inflation)
decrease of $2 billion in Medicare spending 1998 to 1999. Income
exceeded spending by $21 billion (amended Trustee's Report, April
20, 2000). This estimate of the reduction was too small. The
reduction in 1999 was actually $5.1 billion (a 4% decrease) which,
with the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI; part B) deficit of
$1.4 billion, led to a total Medicare savings (Health Insurance and
SMI) of $3.7 billion--as reported in the amended Trustees report.
A problem in calculating the status of Medicare was caused by a
computer programming error that understated the expected rate of
interest on Trust fund monies made by the Health Care Financing
Administration actuaries of $2.1 billion in 2000. This grows to a $20
billion per annum error after 2015 and a $175 billion cumulative
error in 2022. This error represents a shift of 2 years in the date by
which Medicare is projected to be insolvent (i.e., in 2026 rather than
2024). This projection does not take into account the effects of
reduced disability prevalence discussed above.
The 1999 NLTCS showed that the relative rate of improvement
1994 to 1999 was 2.6%--faster than the 1.5% per annum decrease
suggested necessary to preserve Medicare solvency to 2070 (26). If
one took the average decline over the 17 years of the NLTCS
(standardized to the 1999 U.S. population aged 65) the relative
rate of decline would be 1.7% per annum--more than the 1.5%
required to preserve Medicare solvency. The relative decline in
nursing home use was larger (3.5% per annum). This finding is
important because per annum nursing home costs are much larger
than costs for persons not using nursing homes (41). A conservative
estimate is that a nursing home stay cost $47,200 per year in 1999.
The reduction of nursing home stays by 400,000 between what
would have been the use in 1999 calculated from 1994 rates and the
observed rates translates into savings of $18.9 billion.
In the NLTCS black disability rates first increased (1982 to 1989)
and then decreased (faster than for nonblacks) 1989 to 1999. The
source of these changes is likely complex. The analysis showed an
interesting association in the relative trajectory of blacknonblack
disability and education. The trajectory of education can also be

compared with Medicare use. Medicare was in place by 1967. By
1969 the first declines in cardiovascular disease mortality were
noted (after static, or increased, mortality 1954 to 1968). Initially,
black and white utilization of Medicare appeared (up to 1990) to
become more equal with time (42). However, much of the increase
in care used by blacks was for hospitalization for ``end state'' and
emergency services. It is only since 1990 that the detailed black
nonblack differentials in Medicare use could be examined because
detailed diagnostic and service-specific measures were first re-
corded in Medicare files in 1990. Analysis of data after 1990
suggests that while per capita use of Medicare increased for blacks,
whites (assessed 1990 to 1996) still received more care from
specialists and used more high-tech services producing better
overall health (42).
Second, the prevalence of institutional residence declined abso-
lutely 1982 to 1999 despite a more than 30% increase in the U.S.
population aged 65. This decline is consistent with analyses of the
1985 and 1995 NNHS (30). Bishop found that the largest consumer
of institutional (nursing home) care, persons aged 85, reduced use
of institutions from 219.4 visits per 1,000 to 198.6 visits per
1000--9.5%. If 1985 nursing home use rates (specific to age and
sex) are applied to the 1995 population, there would be 250,000
more persons (12.5%) in institutions than observed in 1995. In
that data nursing home use rates reversed themselves for both
blacks and nonblacks aged 85. Nonblack use of nursing homes,
228.71000 in 1985, dropped to 200.71000 in 1995--12.2%. Black

rates of nursing home use in the NNHS increased from 141.51000
in 1985 to 167.11000 in 1995--18.1%. The difference in nursing
home use between blacks and nonblacks at age 85 declined from
8.7% to 3.4%. In the 1994 to 1999 NLTCS, however, there is a large
drop in the black institutional population, consistent with the
probable effects of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 on Medicare
and Medicaid reimbursed institution use (43).
Bishop postulated five reasons for the pattern of use observed in
1985 to 1995 NNHS: (i) disability prevalence declines, (ii) service
of only high-need elders, (iii) limited bed capacity keeping elders
out of homes, (iv) more use of home health care, and (v) the use of
different (and novel) types of residential services (30). The NLTCS
indicates there were large declines in disability for blacks and
nonblacks. Part of this decline is attributable to a reduction, for both
blacks and nonblacks, of nursing home use. Bishop found a decline
in nursing home use rates [8.2% from 1985 to 1995; compare to the
10.8% decline found by Strahan (31)--both Bishop and Strahan
used the 1995 NNHS] and declines in bed occupancy rates (found
in the 1987 to 1996 Medical Expenditures Surveys). This finding
suggests that limited capacity (i.e., available beds) is not keeping
elders out of homes. The provision of services to only high-need
elderly does not explain the trends, because the disability level in the
1984 NLTCS was 4.4 ADLs impaired on average (weighted; 4.7 in
1994) in nursing homes. The rate of disability is so high in nursing
homes that the population could not become much frailer. There
was a major increase in the use of home health services starting in
1989 (stimulated by changes in the Health Care Financing Admin-
istration's reimbursement policy regarding home health reimburse-
ment; HIM-11) and continuing to 1997 (eventually slowed by the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997).
What can be uniquely assessed in the 1999 NLTCS is the growth
of a new sector of the housing market--assisted-care living facilities.
This growth is currently not well understood. The name ``assisted
living'' is, itself, in flux, with Wisconsin relabeling their state
regulations to be for ``residential-care apartment complexes'' (Of-
fice of Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, 2000,
located at http:aspe.os.dhhs.gov). Currently 25% of assisted-
living beds are in three states--California (123,238), Florida
(66,293), and Pennsylvania (62,241). This represents a national
market of 28,000 licensed assisted-living facilities with 612,000 beds.
A problem with this housing sector is that persons are frequently
forced out of assisted-living residence after developing a disability.
Thus, this type of long-term care is developing more as a residential
than institutional model. This is bolstered by the 1999 NLTCS
where, of 811,000 persons (estimated) living in assisted-care facil-
ities, over half reported no chronic disability, and of the other half,
roughly half were recorded as disabled and living in the community;
half were recorded as disabled and meeting the criteria to receive
an institutional survey. While we estimated there were 1.2 million
persons in nursing homes there were 200,000 persons living in
assisted-living facilities who would have been classified as living in
institutional residence in 1999--a total of 1.4 million that can be
contrasted to the NLTCS estimate that 1.9 million persons would
have been designated as in nursing homes in 1994 (based on the
standardization of 1994 institutionalization rates to the 1999 U.S.
age distribution). Another 200,000 persons in assisted-living facil-
ities were in ``community'' residence (according to NLTCS criteria)
with disability (and are in the community disabled population). If
we add the 200,000 disabled receiving a community interview to the
institutional population there are still 200,000 fewer in institutions
(1.6 million) than in 1994 (1.8 million) despite the growth, 1994 to
1999, of the population aged 65 (6.2%).
In summary, the decline in the prevalence of chronically
disabled elderly persons of all types observed 1989 to 1994
accelerated 1994 to 1999. The apparent increase in disability
observed 1982 to 1989 for blacks reversed from 1989 to 1994 and
accelerated 1994 to 1999. This finding is consistent with black
and nonblack educational trends. There was a major change in
the level, and mix, of institutional use by U.S. elderly persons.
This did not cause the population with 5 or 6 ADLs impaired to
increase as might be expected if institutional care were being
``rationed,'' forcing persons into community residence. It could
be argued that persons who were potential residents in nursing
homes, who stayed in the community to receive benefits and
services at home, may, in aggregate, not have deteriorated as
rapidly as persons who were nursing home residents. This
possibility is consistent with concerns over the quality of care in
nursing homes--e.g., the residents may have been less likely to
remain physically active and receive nutritional benefits.
It will be important to track chronic disability over time because,
with the current large size of the U.S. population, increases in birth
rates and in-migration cannot be counted upon to replace losses to
the stock of human capital available to the U.S. economy. Our only
viable strategy is to adopt programs that will preserve human
capital and keep it in the labor force, for longer periods of time (24).
