Declines in older adults' ability to perform tasks as-
sociated with personal care and routine household
needs can lead to a loss of independence and decreased
quality of life. Liu, Coughlin, and McBride (1991) reported
that older adults with greater limitations in activities of daily
living (ADLs) are less likely to continue to live indepen-
dently and utilize assisted-living arrangements earlier. Mod-
els of the disablement process (Nagi, 1979; Verbrugge &
Jette, 1994) postulate that impairments resulting from pa-
thology (e.g., disease) lead to limitations in physical activi-
ties (e.g., walking), which subsequently alter individuals'
ability to perform these tasks of daily living. Research is
needed to investigate disparities in health risk factors that
can result in functional impairment. The current study in-
vestigates the impact of hypertension, which is more preva-
lent among Hispanics, in order to quantify the impact of this
risk factor on Mexican American elders' ability to perform
ADLs and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).
Despite inconsistent terminology in describing the con-
struct that ADLs and IADLs measure (e.g., "disability" by
Nagi, 1979; Verbrugge & Jette, 1994; "functional limita-
tions" by Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993; and "functional status"
by Liang et al., 2008), the tasks assessed by ADL and IADL
measures are relatively consistent in the literature.ADL tasks
include basic self-care activities, such as bathing and eating
(Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963), and IADL
tasks are those activities necessary to run a household, in-
cluding meal preparation and keeping track of finances
(Lawton & Brody, 1969). Previous longitudinal analyses
have indicated that ADL/IADL limitations increase with age
(e.g., Bowen & Gonzalez, 2008; Kahng, Dunkle, & Jackson,
2004; Liang et al.). Although Spector, Katz, Murphy, and
Fulton (1987) suggested that older adults generally become
dependent in IADLs before ADLs, loss of basic ADL abili-
ties may have more serious consequences. For example, in-
dividuals with greater dependency in ADLs, but not IADLs,
have higher mortality rates and greater likelihood of utilizing
an assisted-living facility (Liu, Manton, & Aragon, 2000).
Multiple studies support a link between poorer health status
and ADL/IADL limitations in the older adult community. In
particular, cardiovascular health problems, including hyper-
tension, have been shown to have a more prominent harmful
effect on ADL/IADL limitations than do other types of health
conditions that may affect older adults (e.g., osteoporosis;
Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993). Pinsky and colleagues (1985)
found that ever having a hypertension diagnosis was predic-
tive of greater disability status for both men and women.
Similar findings by Wu, Huang, Wu, McCrone, and Lai
(2007) indicated that hypertension was among one of the
highest risk factors for severe disability (defined as two or
more ADL limitations) in a sample of community-dwelling
older adults. In a literature review by Stuck and colleagues
(1999), hypertension was one of the medical conditions most
closely associated with functional status decline, with 13
independent studies reporting significant risk of functional
status decline for those self-reporting hypertension.
More than half of American adults older than 60 years are
estimated to have hypertension (Ostchega,Yoon, Hughes, &
Louis, 2008), and this rate rises to three fourths by age 70
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008).
For Mexican Americans aged 65 years and older, the rate of
hypertension reaches approximately 60% (Satish, Stroup-
Benham, Espino, Markides, & Goodwin, 1998). Thus, the
impact of hypertension on the ADL/IADL limitations

Hypertension, highly prevalent and often undiagnosed among older MexicanAmericans, is associated with greater
limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) that can lead to
greater dependency for older adults. Using data from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic
Studies of the Elderly study, the rate of increase in ADL/IADL limitations for a 7-year period was examined for
3,046 older Mexican Americans classified either as reporting hypertension at baseline, first reporting hypertension
at subsequent waves, or never reporting hypertension. Latent growth models indicated increased ADL/IADL
limitations over time; individuals with hypertension evidenced greater increases than those without hypertension.
Age, comorbidities, and depression were positively related to greater ADL/IADL limitations at baseline for all
groups; only age was consistently related to ADL/IADL change over time. Development of hypertension may in-
crease the risk of ADL/IADL decline, but early diagnosis and treatment may attenuate this effect.

experienced by older adults may be especially great for older
adults in general and for Mexican American older adults in
particular. For adults, hypertension is generally defined as a
blood pressure more than 140/90 mm Hg (e.g., Hajjar &
Kotchen, 2003; Wang & Wang, 2004) and is diagnosed by
physicians only after at least two separate blood pressure
readings more than this level (Carretero & Oparil, 2000;
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008). If
hypertension is left untreated, serious cardiovascular health
threats can occur, including heart attacks and strokes, and, as
a result, hypertension is associated with increased mortality
rates over time (Hajjar & Kotchen).
Despite the potential health complications associated
with hypertension and the high prevalence of this condition
within the Mexican American community, little research
has focused on the links between hypertension and ADL/
IADL limitations for Mexican Americans. Kington and
Smith (1997) found that chronic diseases, including
hypertension, led to greater functional decline for African
American and Hispanic older adults than for Whites, but
this relationship disappeared when controlling for socioeco-
nomic status. In addition, Mexican Americans older than 65
years are among the groups least likely to achieve hyperten-
sion control through medication adherence and lifestyle al-
terations (Wang &Wang, 2004); for example, approximately
13% of Mexican Americans did not alter their diet or exer-
cise routine, and 31% did not take blood pressure medica-
tion. Thus, Mexican Americans could be at substantial risk
for decrements in overall well-being due to a hypertension
diagnosis.
Stuck and colleagues (1999) called for additional
research on the underlying causes of change in functional
status decline (defined as a combination of ADL/IADL and
physical function limitations) among older adults, such as
the impact of chronic diseases like hypertension. Given the
lack of research on the effects of hypertension in the Mexican
American community, it is important to look at subsequent
changes in ADL/IADL limitations in this group. In addi-
tion, because hypertension is often a precursor to more
serious cardiovascular problems, the timing of if and when
an older adult develops hypertension may influence the
increase in ADL/IADL limitations. Because hypertension
may be comorbid with other chronic health conditions that
affect ADL and IADL limitations (e.g., Kington & Smith,
1997; Stuck et al.), the comorbidity of arthritis, diabetes,
heart attack, and stroke was examined in the current study
as a predictor of ADL/IADL limitations. Other correlates of
ADL/IADL limitations were also examined, including de-
pressive symptomatology, acculturation, and demographic
characteristics. Past research has indicated that depression
is related to greater ADL/IADL limitations (Fifield, Tennen,
Reisine, & McQuillan, 1998; Friedman, Lyness, Delavan,
Li, & Barker, 2008; Starkstein, Mayberg, Leiguarda,
Preziosi, & Robinson, 1992). However, risk for ADL/IADL
limitations can be lower with increased physical activity
levels (Miller, Rejeski, Reboussin, Ten Have, & Ettinger,
2000). Although physical activity was not directly assessed
in the current study, previous studies of Latino samples have
found that more acculturated individuals are more likely to
report exercising regularly (Cantero, Richardson, Baezconde-
Garbanati, & Marks, 1999) and meet recommendations
for moderate and vigorous physical activity (Evenson,
Sarmiento, & Ayala, 2004) and less likely to report a seden-
tary lifestyle (Pérez-Stable, Marín, & VanOss Marín, 1994).
Finally, reports of ADL limitations have been found to be
higher for women, to increase with age, and to be lower for
more educated individuals (e.g., Amaducci et al., 1998;
Liang et al., 2008; Millán-Calenti et al., 2009).
Thus, the present study examined change over time in
ADL and IADL limitations for a group of community-
dwelling Mexican American older adults. We hypothesized
that significant increases in ADL and IADL limitations
would be found over time, given the previous research
demonstrating this trend. Furthermore, three groups were
compared: those with hypertension at baseline, those with
hypertension at a later time point, and those who never had
hypertension. We hypothesized that significant differences
would be found in the ADL and IADL trajectories based on
the timing of development of hypertension such that the two
groups with hypertension would experience greater increases
in ADL/IADL limitations over time. Finally, we examined
demographic variables and other potential correlates ofADL
and IADL performance, hypothesizing that more comorbid
chronic conditions, more depressive symptoms, lower accul-
turation, being female, greater age, and less education would
be related to greater ADL and IADL limitations.
Methods
Participants
The current study utilized the longitudinal Hispanic
Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the
Elderly (EPESE) database (Markides, 1999, 2001, 2004;
Markides & Ray, 2005), which is archived for secondary
data analysis with the Inter-university Consortium for
Political and Social Research. The archived database con-
tained variables collected for a sample of 3,050 Mexican
Americans aged 65 years or older. The current analysis
deleted four participants from the archived database due to
the lack of ADL data at any of the time points. The analysis
sample (N = 3,046) was an average of 73 years old (SD =
6.8; range = 65­99) and had an average of 4.9 years of edu-
cation (SD = 3.9; range = 0­20); in addition, it included
1,290 men and 1,756 women. Descriptive statistics for the
demographic variables are presented in Table 1.
The Hispanic EPESE used a probability sampling method
to obtain a representative sample of noninstitutionalized
MexicanAmerican elders fromTexas, New Mexico, Colorado,
Arizona, and California; an 86% response rate was obtained
of those initially contacted to participate in the study. All
Caskie et al.

data were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted
in the homes of participants with interviewers who were flu-
ent in both Spanish and English; the majority of interviews
were conducted in Spanish. The average time to complete the
full interview was 1 hr and 45 min. (See Black et al., 2003, for
additional information about the Hispanic EPESE methodol-
ogy.) The first wave of data collection took place between
1993 and 1994 (Wave 1/Baseline). The original sample was
contacted again for follow-up interviews in 1995­1996 (Wave
2), 1998­1999 (Wave 3), and 2000­2001 (Wave 4).
Measures
Hypertension status.--Hypertension status was assessed
using a combination of: (a) self-reported hypertension ("Has
a doctor ever told you that you have high blood pressure?"),
(b) self-reported hypertension medications ("Are you cur-
rently taking any medication for high blood pressure?"), (c)
the average of two systolic blood pressure values, and (d)
the average of two diastolic blood pressure values. Partici-
pants who answered affirmatively to both of the self-report
questions or who self-reported hypertension and had either
an average systolic pressure at or more than 140 mm Hg or
an average diastolic pressure at or more than 90 mm Hg
were classified as having hypertension (Markides, 1999).
Using this variable calculated at each of the four waves, par-
ticipants were then classified into one of the following three
groups: those with high blood pressure (HBP) at baseline
(i.e., Wave 1), those with HBP at a later time point (i.e.,
Waves 2, 3, or 4), and those never having HBP. The sample
sizes for these three groups were as follows: (a) Baseline
HBP (n = 1,718), (b) Later HBP (n = 654), and (c) No HBP
(n = 674).
Activities of daily living.--Participants were asked if they
needed any assistance with the following seven activities:
walking across a small room, bathing, personal grooming,
dressing, eating, getting out of bed and into a chair, and
toileting (Branch, Katz, Kniepmann, & Papsidero, 1984;
Katz et al., 1963). The ADL total score is the total number
of areas with limitations as reported by the participant; thus,
higher scores indicate greater need for assistance. Descrip-
tive statistics for all measures are given in Table 2.
Instrumental activities of daily living.--The IADL
scale assessed limitations in a total of eight areas: using
the telephone, traveling alone, shopping, preparing meals,
doing light housework, taking medication, keeping track
of personal finances, and heavy housework (Lawton &
Brody, 1969). Similar to the ADL measure, the total score
for IADLs represented the total number of areas for which
the participant reported needing assistance (yes = 1, no = 0),

with higher total scores indicating greater need for
assistance.
Demographic covariates.--Three demographic variables
were controlled for in the analyses: sex, age, and education.
Participants were asked to specify their sex, age in years,
and the highest grade of school completed.
Comorbidity.--Comorbidity was assessed as the number
of four health conditions (arthritis, diabetes, heart attack,
and stroke) self-reported by participants at baseline.
Depressive symptoms.--Depressive symptoms at baseline
were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies--
Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The CES-D
includes a total of 20 items measured on a 4-point scale
(coded 0­3), assessing the presence (e.g., I felt sad) and
absence (e.g., I was happy) of specific depressive symptoms
over the past week. Possible scores range from 0 to 60.
English language usage.--English language usage has
been used previously as a measure of acculturation (Masel,
Rudkin, & Peek, 2006). This nine-item scale assessed self-
reported competencies in understanding, speaking, and read-
ing English (each coded 0­3); frequency of English usage
with children, friends, neighbors, and at family gatherings
(each coded 0­4); and use of television and radio programs
in English (each coded 0­4). Possible scores range from 0 to
33; greater scores indicate greater English usage at baseline.
Data Analysis
To estimate the rate of change over time in ADLs and
IADLs and investigate possible nonlinearity of the curve,
latent growth models were used to estimate both linear and
quadratic change over time. The linear growth model in-
cluded an intercept and linear slope to represent, respec-
tively, the average performance at Wave 1 and the average
rate of linear change. In the quadratic model, an additional
quadratic parameter was estimated to represent the average
rate of quadratic change, sometimes described as the rate of
acceleration or deceleration of the curve. All factor loadings
from the intercept to the four observed data points were
fixed to 1; for the linear slope factor, these paths were set to
0, 2, 5, and 7, representing the number of years elapsed
since Wave 1. Factor loadings for the quadratic slope were
set to 0, 4, 25, and 49. Thus, the mean linear and quadratic
slopes are interpreted, respectively, as the average rates of
linear and quadratic change for 1 year. Because latent
growth modeling was used, the assumption of equal mea-
surement errors was also able to be tested for both models
(Willett & Sayer, 1994). Measurement error, loosely con-
ceptualized as the random variance between observed and
true scores on a construct, is typically assumed to be inde-
pendent and homoscedastic (i.e., equal) over time. How-
ever, as Sayer and Cumsille (2001) explain, observing
heterogeneous error variances over time is typical in devel-
opmental research because developmental changes in the
construct under study are often accompanied by increases
in variance in the construct over time.
Several fit indices assessed model fit. In addition to the
chi-square statistic, known to be overly sensitive with large
samples such as in the current study, three additional fit in-
dices were also examined: the comparative fit index (CFI),
the Tucker­Lewis index (TLI), and the root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA). Values of .95 or better on
the CFI and TLI and values of .05 or less on the RMSEA
indicated good fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Amos 16.0 soft-
ware (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) (Arbuckle, 2007) was used
to estimate the latent growth models; this program uses full
information maximum likelihood estimation, which accom-
modates missing data.
The first step of the analysis estimated two unconditional
(i.e., no-predictor) growth models for the total sample (i.e.,
linear and quadratic models) to investigate the form of the
curve and establish base rates of change in the total sample.
Next, three multigroup models were estimated to allow pa-
rameter estimates to be compared across the three HBP
groups (i.e., Baseline HBP, Later HBP, No HBP). The first
multigroup model allowed both the intercept and slope of
the three HBP groups to be freely estimated. This full model
was then compared, using a chi-square difference test, with
two restricted models: (a) where intercepts were constrained
to equality across the three HBP groups and (b) where slopes
were constrained to equality across the three HBP groups.
These comparisons tested, respectively, the hypothesis of
HBP group differences in baseline ADL and IADL limita-
tions and the hypothesis of HBP group differences in rate
of change in ADLs and IADLs for the 7-year period cov-
ered by the Hispanic EPESE database. Finally, covariates
(i.e., age, sex, education, baseline comorbidities, depressive
symptoms, and English language usage) were added to the
models to investigate their influence on group differences in
ADL and IADL change and their relationship to baseline
performance and change over time in ADLs and IADLs.
Results
Growth Models for ADL and IADL Limitations: Total
Sample
Using data from the total sample (N = 3,046), linear and
quadratic growth models were first estimated for ADLs and
IADLs to determine the appropriate form of the trajectories,
assuming a homogeneous error structure.As shown in Table 3,
both models fit equally well; however, little benefit appeared to
be gained by increasing the complexity of the model to include
the quadratic term. For ADLs, mean quadratic growth was
very small though statistically significant (p = .025), and the
variance for the quadratic term could not be estimated and was
set to 0. For IADLs, both the mean and variance for quadratic
Caskie et al.
300
growth were nonsignificant (p = .521 and p = .238, respec-
tively). Thus, the linear model was used in further analyses.
Next, the assumption of homogeneous error variances over
time was tested (Willett & Sayer, 1994) by comparing linear
models with homogeneous (i.e., equal over time) and het-
eroscedastic (i.e., unequal over time) measurement error struc-
tures. Parameter estimates and fit indices for both models are
reported in Table 4. The equal error variances model was re-
jected in favor of the unequal error variances model for both
ADLs, Dc2(3) = 82.64, p < .001, and IADLs, Dc2(3) = 58.06,
p < .001, indicating that the measurement error variance for
these measures was not constant across the four time points.
For both measures, the linear rate of change for the total
sample was statistically significant and positive, although
relatively small (ADLs: 0.12 per year; IADLs: 0.15 per
year). These slopes equate to an average increase of almost
one additional ADL limitation (0.12 × 7 = .84) and one
IADL limitation (0.15 × 7 = 1.05) during the 7 years be-
tween the baseline and Wave 4 assessments. Thus, ADL
limitations were estimated to increase from a baseline aver-
age of 0.50 to 1.34, and IADL limitations were estimated to
increase from a baseline average of 1.53 to 2.58. Significant
interindividual variability was observed for ADL and IADL
outcomes in both intercept (baseline value) and slope (lin-
ear rate of change).
Growth Models for ADL and IADL Limitations: By HBP
Group
Given the significant variability in intercepts and slopes
observed for both ADLs and IADLs, multiple-group latent
growth models were estimated to investigate HBP status
(i.e., Baseline HBP, Later HBP, or No HBP) as a possible
explanation for this variability. To test for group differences
at baseline, the unconstrained intercepts and slopes model
was compared with the constrained Intercepts Only model
for each of the two outcomes. The chi-square difference
tests indicated significant baseline differences between the
HBP groups for both ADL, Dc2(2) = 30.837, p < .001, and
IADL, Dc2(2) = 24.421, p < .001, limitations. Next, group
differences in the linear rate of change were examined by
comparing the unconstrained Intercepts and Slopes model

with the constrained Slopes Only model for ADLs and
IADLs. Significant group differences in slopes were found
for ADLs, Dc2(2) = 6.668, p =.036, but not for IADLs,
Dc2(2) = 1.536, p = .464. Thus, the best-fitting models were
the unconstrained intercepts and slopes model for ADLs
and the constrained slopes Only model for IADLs. The
model fit statistics for the three models analyzed for ADLs
and for IADLs are shown in Table 5, and the parameter
HYPERTENSION AND ADL
/IADL LIMITATIONS 301
estimates for the best-fitting unconditional models are
shown in Table 6.
For all three HBP groups, significant increases for 7 years
(i.e., slopes) were found for both ADL and IADL limita-
tions, with significant between-group differences in these
rates of change for ADLs only. The estimate of change in
IADLs was identical to the finding in the total sample. For
ADLs, the Later HBP group had the largest slope, indicat-
ing the largest increase in ADL limitations after baseline,
and the No HBP group had the lowest rate of change.
Finally, baseline ADL and IADL limitations were not sig-
nificantly correlated with ADL or IADL slope, except in the
ADL model for the group with hypertension at baseline
(r = .13, p < .05).
Controlling for Covariates of ADL and IADL Limitations
In the final models, demographic covariates (age, educa-
tion, and sex), comorbidities, depressive symptoms, and
English language usage were added to the multiple-group
latent growth models. Controlling for these covariates, chi-
square difference tests again indicated significant differ-
ences at baseline between the HBP groups for ADLs (p <
.001) and IADLs (p = .012) and in slope (p = .036) forADLs;
a significant difference (p = .043) was now found when
IADL slopes were constrained across group. Follow-up
model comparisons showed that the IADL slopes for Base-
line HBP and Later HBP were significantly greater than the
No HBP group's slope. Estimates for the growth parameters
from the conditional models are shown in Table 7.
For all three groups, age was significantly related to ADL
limitation at baseline (p < .001), IADL limitation at baseline
(p < .001), ADL slope (p < .001), and IADL slope (p <
.001). Greater age was related to more ADL and IADL lim-
itations at baseline and greater rates of change over time.
Education was significantly related to changes in IADL
limitations (p = .013) only for Baseline HBP; less education
was related to greater rates of change in IADL limitations.
Sex was a significant predictor only of IADL impairment at
baseline (p = .03) for Baseline HBP; women had higher
IADL limitations at baseline than men. The number of co-
morbidities was a significant predictor of ADL and IADL
limitations at baseline (p < .001 for Baseline HBP and No
HBP; p = .003 for Later HBP), but was only significantly
related to ADL slope in the Baseline HBP group (p = .003)
and IADL slope in the No HBP group (p = .030). Greater
comorbidities at baseline were related to more baseline
ADL and IADL limitations; furthermore, for those with hy-
pertension at baseline, having more comorbid conditions
was related to a greater rate of increase in ADL limitations,
and for those never reporting hypertension, to greater rate of
increase in IADL limitations. Greater depressive symptoms
(p < .001) were related to greater ADL and IADL limita-
tions at baseline for all groups and to less change over time in
IADLs (p = .030) for the Later HBP group. Greater English
language usage was related to fewer ADL and IADL limita-
tions at baseline for the Baseline HBP (p = .002; p < .001)
and No HBP (p = .013; p < .001) groups and to lower ADL
slopes for the No HBP group (p = .048).
Discussion
The current study utilized latent growth curve modeling
to examine changes in ADL/IADL limitations for a sample
of Mexican American elders for a 7-year period as well as
the relation of hypertension status and other covariates to
ADL/IADL trajectories. Investigation of the potential ef-
fects of hypertension status on performance of ADL/IADL
tasks is particularly important as: (a) hypertension is a
known correlate of decline in functioning and negative out-
comes (e.g., physical disability, heart attack, stroke) and (b)
Hispanic elders, including Mexican Americans, demon-
strate an elevated risk for hypertension. This longitudinal
analysis adds to the limited research available documenting
changes in Mexican American elders' ADL/IADL limita-
tions over time and examines predictors of ADL/IADL
limitations that are relevant to this ethnic group.
As hypothesized, the results of the present study indi-
cated that significant increases in ADL and IADL limita-
tions were experienced for the 7 years in which the research

was conducted. This finding is in agreement with the litera-
ture on this topic, which has shown that ADL/IADL limita-
tions tend to increase over time in older adults (e.g., Liang
et al., 2008). More IADL limitations than ADL limitations
were observed, supporting previous findings by Spector and
colleagues (1987). Also consistent with expectations, dif-
ferences in the rate of increase in ADL/IADL limitations
were observed as a function of hypertension status. Indi-
viduals without hypertension demonstrated lower increases
over time in the number of ADL and IADL limitations than
individuals who met hypertensive criteria. This finding sug-
gests that a hypertension diagnosis may lead to more rapid
declines in the ability to perform ADLs in the older adult
Mexican American population. These results support previ-
ous research (e.g., Hajjar, Lackland, Cupples, & Lipsitz,
2007; Pinsky et al., 1985) showing that hypertensive indi-
viduals are more likely to experience difficulties perform-
ing ADLs/IADLs than are nonhypertensive individuals.
Examination of the effects of covariates on ADL/IADL
trajectories revealed several findings. Consistent with prior
research, greater age was related to more ADL and IADL
limitations at baseline and greater rates of change over time.
Less education was related to greater IADL change for indi-
viduals with hypertension at baseline. It is possible that the
greater cognitive demands of the IADL tasks (e.g., financial
management) combined with the physical toll of hyperten-
sion may explain this increased rate of impairment for indi-
viduals with less education.This group also had significantly
higher comorbidities at baseline than the other two groups,
which may have contributed to their greater increases in
IADL limitations. Women had higher IADL limitations at
baseline compared with men in the group with hypertension
at baseline. Sex differences in IADLs may be explained by
differences in socioeconomic status, division of labor, and
education between men and women, particularly when
comparing the current older adult cohort with younger
cohorts (Liang et al., 2008). For all three groups, number
of comorbidities (i.e., arthritis, diabetes, heart attack, and
stroke) was a significant predictor of baseline ADL and
IADL limitations. However, the relation of comorbid condi-
tions to change in ADLs/IADLs was fairly limited; having
more comorbid conditions was significantly related only to
greater increases in ADL limitations for individuals report-
ing hypertension at baseline and to greater increases in
IADL limitations for individuals never reporting hyperten-
sion. The finding for the group with hypertension at base-
line may reflect an additive effect of having multiple
conditions, resulting in possible decreases in physical activ-
ity or polypharmacy. The group never reporting hyperten-
sion experienced greater attrition at each wave than other
groups, which may have resulted in a healthier remaining
subsample who did not experience IADL declines until af-
ter baseline.
In summary, this study demonstrated significant increases
in ADL and IADL limitations for a 7-year period. Greater
increases were observed for IADL limitations as opposed to
ADL limitations, although the amount differed based on
when or if an individual met the criteria for hypertension.
Individuals who met these criteria showed higher rates of
increase in ADL and IADL limitations than those without
hypertension, though for ADLs, these increases were
smaller for individuals meeting hypertensive criteria at en-
try into the study than for individuals meeting hypertensive
criteria during the study, when controlling for demographic,
health, and psychological covariates. Thus, development of
HBP appears to put individuals at risk for functional de-
cline, but earlier diagnosis or treatment may be protective.
However, we also found that having a greater number of
comorbid conditions (i.e., arthritis, diabetes, heart attack,
and stroke) increased the rate of ADL limitations for indi-
viduals with hypertension at entry to the study. In compari-
son, increased comorbidities at baseline were related to
greater increases in IADL limitations for individuals not
meeting hypertensive criteria during the study.
The present study is limited in several ways. First, it is
important to note that the current findings are specific to a
Mexican American population of older adults and should
not be generalized to all Hispanic individuals or other
HYPERTENSION AND ADL
/IADL LIMITATIONS 303
ethnic groups. The second caveat relates to the accurate as-
sessment of hypertension, which is a critical issue, particu-
larly among this population. Of those Mexican Americans
with hypertension, up to half may be unaware that they have
this health condition (Glover, Greenlund, Ayala, & Croft,
2005; Satish, Markides, Zhang, & Goodwin, 1997; Wang &
Wang, 2004) and, even among those aware of having hyper-
tension, some individuals may not respond accurately to
self-report health measures, such as those utilized in this
study (Bush, Miller, Golden, & Hale, 1989). A strength of
the current study is the inclusion of both subjective (i.e.,
self-reported diagnosis and medications) and objective (i.e.,
actual blood pressure readings) indicators of hypertension;
however, a physician's diagnosis was not available. A third
issue is that hypertension control was not examined directly
in our analyses. Some research indicates that the use of anti-
hypertensive medications can help to prevent or delay subse-
quent ADL/IADL limitations in older adults (e.g., Elias &
Elias, 2007; Hajjar et al., 2007). In addition, Hispanic older
adults have been shown to be less likely to achieve control of
their condition compared with other groups, often due to
lower antihypertensive medication use (Sudano & Baker,
2001; Wang & Wang). Sudano and Baker speculated that
Hispanics' lower antihypertensive medications use may be
related to limited English proficiency, influencing the level
of care they receive and their understanding of physician
recommendations. This sample's English proficiency was
relatively limited, which may have influenced their level of
hypertension control. Finally, we did not have a direct mea-
sure of physical activity, but examined acculturation as a
correlate of physical activity (Cantero et al., 1999; Evenson
et al., 2004; Pérez-Stable et al., 1994). Future research
should include variables that assess antihypertension medi-
cation use as well as other methods of hypertension control
(e.g., lifestyle change) in Hispanic older adults. Other
measures that would also be beneficial to include in future
studies include a direct measure of physical activity and
examination of medical records to determine objectively the
length of time for which individuals entering the study with
diagnosed hypertension may have had this health condition.
This study contributes to the existing body of literature
by examining the relationship between hypertension and
ADLs over time in an understudied ethnic minority older
adult population. The demonstrated increases over time in
ADL and IADL limitations for Mexican Americans are
important for public health and social service agencies as
well as researchers to consider in light of the growing
numbers of older Mexican Americans, whose increased
needs for assistance with ADLs as a consequence of hy-
pertension would likely increase demands not only on
public resources but also their kin networks (Angel & An-
gel, 1998). Over-reliance by Hispanic elders on social sup-
port networks could lead to increased psychological
distress and decreased quality of life for the elders (Cruza-
Guet, Spokane, Caskie, Szapocznik, & Brown, 2008).
Additional research is needed to compare various ethnic
minority groups of older adults with hypertension and the
subsequent rates of change in ADL and IADL limitations
that they experience over time to better understand health
disparities of these groups. Such a study could also com-
pare socioeconomic status and its relationship with func-
tional decline over time (e.g., Kington & Smith, 1997).
Future research in this area may also explore additional
psychological variables, such as social support, which
may influence the relationship between hypertension and
changes in ADLs and IADLs over time.
