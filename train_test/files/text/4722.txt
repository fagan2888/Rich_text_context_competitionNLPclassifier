Introduction
Between a quarter and a third of cats presenting to

animal welfare organisations such as Cats Protection are
recorded as strays at admission and many of the female
cats are of unknown neuter status.1,2 Currently, the gold
standard method of determining neuter status is per-
forming exploratory laparotomy under general anaes-
thesia, which is invasive, costly and potentially risky. In
addition, surgical confirmation of neutering for cats of
unknown neuter status is likely to be more time consum-
ing owing to potentially increased time under anaes-
thetic, more traumatic owing to increased length of
incision and tissue handling, and may necessitate longer

Abstract
Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a patient-side blood test in determining neuter
status in female cats.
Methods Residual blood samples from female cats of unknown neuter status that were admitted to four cat adoption
centres in the UK were tested for luteinising hormone (LH) using the Witness LH test (Zoetis). A positive LH test
result indicated that the cat was neutered. Cats were assessed for evidence of a surgical scar suggestive of prior
neutering; if none was found, an exploratory laparotomy was performed to confirm neuter status. The LH test
performance was assessed (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value).
Results Two hundred and thirty-six cats had both LH test and exploratory laparotomy data. The specificity of the
test in detecting neutered cats was 100% (95% confidence interval 96.2­99.9) and the sensitivity was 69% (95%
confidence interval 59.3­76.8). The prevalence of neutered cats in this sample was 49%. The positive and negative
predictive values were 1 and 0.77, respectively.
Conclusions and relevance The Witness LH test correctly detected all unneutered cats and thus there were no false
positive results that incorrectly indicated a cat was neutered. This study therefore suggests that positive LH test
results avoid the need to perform surgery to confirm neuter status. This has significant welfare benefits for cats as it
provides a lower risk, faster and less traumatic alternative to surgery and, in the shelter setting, it will have a positive
impact on the cost, speed of assessment and time to rehoming of cats.

recovery. Exploratory laparotomy as a method to confirm
neuter status may also be frustrating for the surgeon.
From a shelter perspective, performing an exploratory
laparotomy to confirm neuter status compared with
using a blood test involves more surgery-associated costs
(anaesthesia, suture material, professional fees) and
results in longer length of stay. Clipping hair from the
flanks and midline to check for evidence of a surgical scar
is used by some practitioners, but this can be unreliable,
leading to misdiagnosis of neuter status and occasionally
resulting in pregnancy and unwanted litters.
It is widely recognised that circulating levels of

luteinising hormone (LH) in unneutered cats are low, apart
from a short-term surge of LH that occurs after mating
which usually leads to ovulation.3­6 Ovulation can also
occasionally occur in the absence of copulatory stimula-
tion, caused by release of LH triggered by other stimuli.7
Basal levels of LH during anoestrus are maintained by
negative feedback from the gonads. Various studies have
shown that after the gonads are removed, LH levels rise.5,8,9
It is this principle of higher LH levels in neutered cats that
has stimulated interest in using detection of LH levels to
differentiate between neutered and unneutered cats.
Radioimmunoassay and a plate-based enzyme immuno-
assay have been used to detect LH in serum, but both are
expensive, labour intensive, time consuming, require tech-
nical expertise and can only be performed in a laboratory.
The Witness LH test (Zoetis) is a semi-quantitative
rapid immune migration assay that was developed for
use in dogs to identify the LH surge and thus timing of
ovulation. It has more recently been used to distinguish
ovariectomised from sexually intact cats and dogs. It is an
immunochromatographic assay that uses gold-conju-
gated antibodies to give a visual line in the presence of
LH. A positive result occurs when the LH level in the
sample is greater than 1 ng/ml, which indicates that the
individual has been neutered (Witness LH direction
insert). This test requires little technical expertise and
provides a result in 20 mins without the need to send
samples to a laboratory for analysis. The test instructions
stipulate that any positive test result should be repeated
in 2 h with a new sample to rule out a false positive result
that could be caused by the brief, episodic surges of
serum LH that have been shown to occur in unneutered
cats.5 The test instructions also say to repeat the test 24 h
later when a positive result is obtained in a cat suspected
to be in oestrus.
The purpose of this study was to assess if the Witness
LH test could be used to accurately assess the neuter sta-
tus of queens. The study proposed that a single blood
sample could be used to reliably predict the neuter sta-
tus of female cats, thereby reducing the use of explora-
tory laparotomy to confirm whether a cat is neutered or
not, as well as reducing the need for repeated blood sam-
pling, as described above.
Materials and methods
Sample size calculations indicated that 323 samples
would be required for 95% confidence and 5% precision
of the estimate in a population with a 0.3 prevalence of
neutered cats. Based on the findings of a pilot study and
the sample size estimate, this study was conducted using
all suitable cats admitted to four Cats Protection adoption
centres over a 30 month period. This enabled enough
data to be collected and assisted in the assessment of any
effects related to time of year (ie, ensuring some

anoestrous queens during the winter months were
assessed).
Inclusion criteria were female cats of unknown neuter
status estimated to be 4 months of age. Exclusion crite-
ria were females estimated to be <4 months of age,
females that were palpably pregnant, lactating or with
kittens, and cats with the tip of the pinna removed from
the left ear (indicating likely previous neuter surgery).
Cats that met the inclusion criteria were blood sam-
pled for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukae-
mia virus screening as per normal practice for cats
admitted to Cats Protection adoption centres and the
patient-side Witness LH test was performed on residual
fresh serum within 24 h. The test was run in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions by trained person-
nel at the adoption centres and then recorded as a posi-
tive, negative or `unable to interpret' result.Aphotograph
was taken of the test kit after the sample was run and this
was interpreted by an independent observer who was
blinded to the outcome recorded by the adoption centre
staff. If there was a discrepancy in interpretation of the
result, the photo was sent to the person who ran the test
and a second (blinded) interpretation was requested. The
veterinary surgeons involved in the study were blinded
to the results of the LH test. Cats were checked at flank
and midline locations for evidence of a surgical scar at
the time of first veterinary clinical examination, under
general anaesthesia before exploratory laparotomy, or on
both occasions. If the operating veterinary surgeon was
unsure of the neuter status on the basis of any marking
on the skin, the cat underwent exploratory laparotomy as
per normal practice. The surgery was performed at least
24 h after blood sampling in case the sample happened to
be taken during an LH spike in an unneutered cat.
Ovariohysterectomy was performed where appropriate
or the cat was confirmed neutered. In cases where
venepuncture was performed for other clinical purposes,
a second blood sample was collected on the day of sur-
gery, in case a second test for LH was needed.
Severely haemolysed or lipaemic samples were
excluded from the study, but some slightly haemolysed
samples were included. The impact of poor technique in
running the test was minimised by having the same per-
son train all operators, having clear written instructions,
by conducting a pilot study and by minimising the
Morrow et al 3
number of different people running the test. Any LH
tests where the control failed were excluded from the
study.
Results of the Witness LH test were compared to
results of exploratory laparotomy as gold standard. The
outcomes used to assess the performance of the LH assay
in this population were sensitivity, specificity, and posi-
tive and negative predictive values. Sensitivity, or the
LH test's ability to detect neutered cats, was calculated
as the number of cats that the test correctly categorised
as neutered (true positive test result) divided by the total
number of cats found to be neutered at exploratory lapa-
rotomy (positive gold standard result). Specificity, or the
test's ability to detect unneutered cats, was calculated as
the number of cats that the test correctly categorised as
unneutered (true negative test result) divided by the
total number of cats found to be unneutered at explora-
tory laparotomy (negative gold standard result). The
positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated as the
number of cats correctly identified by the LH test as neu-
tered divided by the total number of positive LH test
results. The negative predictive value (NPV) was calcu-
lated as the number of cats correctly identified by the LH
test as unneutered divided by the total number of nega-
tive LH test results.
The study was approved by the University of Bristol's
ethics committee.
Results
Data were collected between 3 November 2014 and 3
May 2017. Four hundred and forty-two cats were
enrolled in the study. One hundred and thirty-four cats
did not have an LH test result and were excluded from
the final analysis (Table 1). Seventy-two cats did not
have an exploratory laparotomy and were excluded
from the final analysis (Table 2).
Two hundred and thirty-six cats had both an LH test
and exploratory laparotomy and were included in the
data analysis. Twelve per cent of cats were sedated at
time of blood sampling. Overall, 10 different staff
members ran and interpreted the tests at the four adop-
tion centres and approximately 19 different vets per-
formed the exploratory laparotomies (some data were
missing on name of surgeon performing the explora-
tory laparotomy). Samples were tested in all months of
the year, ranging from 5­36 tests per month overall.
There were no post-homing reports of cats coming into
season or becoming pregnant 8 months after data col-
lection ended (follow-up ranged from 8­36 months
post-neutering, depending on the date the cat entered
the study). The test performance results are summa-
rised in Figure 1.
Discussion
The specificity of the Witness LH test was 100% (95%
confidence interval [CI] 96.2­99.9), indicating that the
test had an excellent ability to detect unneutered cats.
Sensitivity was 69% (95% CI 59.3­76.8), which indicated
that a reasonable number of the neutered cats tested pos-
itive, but some false negative results occurred (ie, the LH
test indicated the cat was unneutered, but it was found
to be neutered at exploratory laparotomy). The primary
consideration when using the test to assess neuter status
is that every positive test represents a truly neutered cat
so that an unneutered cat is not rehomed in the mistaken
belief that it is neutered. These data provide evidence
that within our sample the Witness LH test fulfilled this
requirement (PPV of 1). The NPV of 0.77 for this study
(where the prevalence of neutered cats was 49%) indi-
cated that for negative LH test results, an exploratory
laparotomy should be performed to confirm the true
neuter status of the cat.

Asmall study by Scebra and Griffin of 50 cats of known
neuter status (48% neutered) found that the Witness LH
test categorised all neutered cats correctly, but classified
two of the unneutered cats as being neutered, resulting in
a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 92.3%, a PPV of 92%
and a NPV of 100%.10 In contrast to the data presented
here, they encountered false positive results but not false
negative results. This difference between results could be
due to the small sample size in the study by Scebra and
Griffin,10 but, ultimately, the reason for this discrepancy is
unknown. Rohlertz et al compared the Witness LH test to
the gonadotropin releasing hormone-stimulation test in 31
cats of known neuter status (48% neutered) and reported
one false negative result and no false positive results with
the LH test.11 These results are similar to the data presented
here, but as with the study by Scebra and Griffin,10 the
sample size was small. Most recently, Alm and Holst com-
pared the Witness LH test to an anti-Müllerian hormone
assay in dogs of known neuter and oestrous status and
found that in 100 non-oestrus bitches, the Witness LH test
produced three false negative test results and no false posi-
tive test results.12 The present study was designed to assess

the performance of the Witness LH test under the condi-
tions it is most likely to be used, namely, when neuter sta-
tus of the cat is not known at time of testing and where
multiple users are running and interpreting the test.
In this application of the Witness LH test, the conse-
quences of a false positive test result are greater than
that of a false negative result; if a cat was homed or
released as neutered on the basis of a (false) positive LH
test result, but was not actually neutered, this has more
significant consequences than obtaining a (false) nega-
tive result, performing exploratory laparotomy and then
establishing that the cat is already neutered. The test is
useful because the majority of cats that were already
neutered were ruled out of needing an exploratory lapa-
rotomy by the positive LH test result. In addition, as
there were no false positive results, all of the unneutered
cats that needed to go to exploratory laparotomy were
identified by the test.
The lack of false positive results also indicated that
none of the unneutered cats had a pre-ovulatory LH
peak, a spontaneous ovulation or an episodic surge of LH
at the time of sampling. In most queens behavioural signs
of oestrus are very obvious and the other scenarios are
probably extremely uncommon. Thus, the results of this
study suggest that it is not necessary to do a second LH
test with a new sample every time a positive result is
obtained. The exception to this would be if a cat is sus-
pected to be showing signs of oestrus, a second test could
be performed 24 h later (as per the test instructions);
however, if the signs of oestrus were unequivocal, the cat
would more likely be taken to surgery for neutering
without waiting and repeating the test. In this group of
cats, two were recorded by staff as showing signs of oes-
trus and both of them were negative with the LH test and
were found to be unneutered at exploratory laparotomy.
The Witness LH test correctly identified all unneu-
tered cats in this study and the tests were run every
month of the year, suggesting that the time of year when
the sampling is carried out does not affect the accuracy
of the test. This is reassuring in that it indicates the per-
formance of the test is not affected by anoestrus.
There were 36 false negative test results (36/157 nega-
tive test results [23%] ie, when the test indicated the cat
was unneutered when it was actually already neutered).
Possible explanations for this are testing error, gold
standard error, physiological differences between neu-
tered cats, stress or anaesthetic agents.
Testing error can occur owing to factors such as sam-
ple quality, poor technique running the test, failure of the
control and inaccurate test interpretation (misclassifica-
tion of the result). The majority of false negative results
occurred when clear serum samples were used com-
pared to slightly haemolysed samples (data not shown),
so sample quality did not appear to influence the num-
ber of false negative results in this study.
Inaccurate test result interpretation was likely to be
the most significant source of error with this semi-
quantitative test because determination of a positive
result was based on subjective assessment of the test
line being `similar or greater intensity to the control
line'. Visual interpretation of immune migration assays
can be problematic and is a recognised issue.13 In this
case, it was not clear from the test insert instructions
whether `similar' includes only test lines that are equal
to the control line or whether test lines that are slightly
less intense than the control line would be considered
`similar' and thus be categorised as a positive test
result. In addition, people have different abilities to
detect small differences between colour intensity and
this needs to be accounted for when developing patient-
side tests that will, by their nature, be run and inter-
preted by many different people. Post-study assessment
of photos of the false negative results showed that in
about half of them the test line was less intense than the
control, but it was close enough that it could be inter-
preted as similar and thus be categorised as a positive
result. If this was the case, in this set of data, test perfor-
mance results for this study would become sensitivity
84%, specificity 100%, PPV of 1 and NPV of 0.87. If the
interpretation parameters for the test could be
improved, the frequency of false negative results could
be reduced. One promising solution to this would be
the use of a recently developed smartphone application
that quantitatively measures the LH level based on a
photo of the test.14
While it is generally accepted that LH levels are
higher in neutered cats than in unneutered cats,5,6,8,9 it is
possible that some neutered cats naturally have low LH,
or LH levels in neutered cats are variable and occasion-
ally fall below the detection limit of assay (1 ng/ml),
thus leading to a false negative result. It has been shown
that time since neuter may also affect circulating levels
of LH,5,9 but in this study it was not known when the cat
was neutered and so it was not possible to attribute the
explanation for false negative results to this. The lack of
knowledge of when the cat was neutered does reflect the
conditions under which the test would normally be run
(ie, to find out whether a cat is neutered or not). A study
that measured LH levels over time post-neutering using
the Witness LH test would provide more information on
how LH levels vary after neutering and whether this
impacts on test performance.
Stress has been shown to reduce LH secretion in
ewes15 and in cats it has been shown to reduce pituitary
sensitivity to LH-releasing hormone,16 so this could have
had an impact on the number of false negative results.
Degree of stress was not formally assessed in this study,
but further studies could examine whether cats that are
experiencing a high level of stress are more likely to have
false negative LH test results. Anaesthetic agents have
6 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery
also been shown to inhibit LH release in multiple spe-
cies, including cats;5 however, in this study sedated cats
were not over-represented in cats that had a false

negative LH test result (data not shown).
Conclusions
In this study, the Witness LH test had excellent specificity
and reasonable sensitivity for use in cats of unknown

neuter status. There are significant welfare benefits to
using this test in cats of unknown neuter status because
all cats that test positive can confidently be identified as
neutered, without the need for further assessment by a
surgical procedure. While this study showed that not
every neutered cat will be detected by the LH test, 77% of
them were, which means an approximate potential 77%
reduction in these unnecessary surgeries.
The Witness LH test is currently the only available
non-surgical test for assessing the reproductive status of
cats that is easy to run, where a reliable result can be
obtained using one blood sample and where an answer
is obtained only 20 mins after sampling. This is a major
advantage in practical field applications. All other cur-
rently available blood tests to determine neuter status
require multiple blood samples, injections of hormones
and/or need to be sent to a laboratory for analysis,
resulting in higher cost and a significantly longer time
from assessment to results.
