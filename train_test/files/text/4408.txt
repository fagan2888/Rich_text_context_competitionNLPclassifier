Abstract
Objective: Betatrophin is a newly identified circulating protein that is significantly associated with
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), adiposity, and metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to
investigate whether betatrophin levels and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were associated.
Methods: Circulating betatrophin levels were measured in 162 patients with PCOS and 156
matched control females using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Correlations
between betatrophin levels and PCOS incidence as well as multiple key endocrine PCOS
parameters were analyzed using multiple statistical methods.
Results: Betatrophin levels were significantly increased in patients with PCOS (685.3 Æ 27.7 vs.
772.6 Æ 42.5 pg/ml). When sub-grouping all investigated subjects according to the presence of
insulin resistance, women with PCOS and insulin resistance exhibited markedly higher betatrophin
concentrations. Furthermore, betatrophin levels were significantly correlated with fasting insulin
levels and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance only in females with PCOS
(r ¼ 0.531 and r ¼ 0.628, respectively).
Conclusion: We provide the first report that betatrophin is strongly associated with PCOS. This
study suggests that betatrophin may potentially serve as an independent predictor for the
development of PCOS in at-risk women, especially those with insulin resistance.

Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the
primary cause of anovulatory infertility1
and affects up to 10% of women of repro-
ductive age.2 The exact pathophysiology of
PCOS is complex and remains largely
unclear. However, the aetiology of PCOS
is underpinned by both insulin resistance
and hyperandrogenism, with insulin resist-
ance exacerbating hyperandrogenism.3
Insulin resistance occurs in approximately
80% of women with PCOS and occurs
independently of obesity.4 Furthermore,
women with PCOS are believed to be at an
increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM).5 A recent meta-analysis of
13 studies reported a 4-fold increased risk of
T2DM in women with PCOS.6 Thus, PCOS
is a well-defined clinical model of insulin
resistance and the pre-diabetic state.
Betatrophin, also known as angiopoietin-
like protein (ANGPTL8), is a newly identi-
fied circulating protein predominantly
produced in the liver and adipose tissue.
Betatrophin is induced as a result of insulin
resistance,7 therefore attracting increasing
attention. Betatrophin was reported to pro-
mote pancreatic beta cell proliferation and
improve metabolic control by increasing the
beta cell division rate in insulin resistant
mice.7 However, in humans, the associations
of serum betatrophin levels with diabetes,
obesity, and lipid profiles remain controver-
sial.8,9 Some studies have suggested that
circulating betatrophin levels are elevated
in T2DM as well as type 1 diabetes,10­17
correlating with lipid profiles,18 while others
reported that betatrophin levels were
reduced in subjects with diabetes.19
Accumulating evidence suggests that beta-
trophin is significantly associated with adi-
posity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic
syndrome.17,18,20
To date, there have been no reports on
the relationship between betatrophin and
PCOS. In fact, most women with PCOS
display impaired glucose tolerance and are
at higher risk for developing T2DM.21
Moreover, betatrophin has a close relation-
ship with insulin resistance and
T2DM.8,14,17 These observations raise the
question of whether abnormal betatrophin
might associate with PCOS. Therefore, the
present study aimed to detect circulating
betatrophin levels in subjects with PCOS
and healthy control female patients. We also
evaluated the association between betatro-
phin levels and clinical, hormonal, and
metabolic variables to achieve a better
understanding of the relationship between
betatrophin and PCOS.
Patients and methods
Study participants
This case-control study was approved
by the Institutional Ethical Review
Board of Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital
(H20130381). Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients before the
initiation of the study. We included 162
women with a diagnosis of PCOS and 156
non-hirsute ovulatory women (regular
cycles and luteal phase progesterone levels
higher than 3.8 ng/mL), ranging from 18 to
45 years of age, in the study at our clinic
between February 2013 and November
2015. PCOS diagnosis was determined
according to the Rotterdam PCOS
194 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
Consensus criteria.22 Each subject under-
went a complete medical examination and
an endocrine profile and haematological,
hepatic, and renal function analysis. Women
with body mass index (BMI) ranging from
18.0 to 40.0 kg/m2 were selected for the
study. We made further subgroupings
based on the presence of insulin resistance,
defined as a homeostatic model assessment
(HOMA) index of !2.4.23 None of the
women from either group had received any
drugs known to interfere with hormone
levels, blood pressure, or metabolic vari-
ables for at least 3 months before the study.
Women with diabetes, liver or kidney dis-
ease, thyroid dysfunction, or pregnancy
were excluded.
Biochemical and hormonal assays
Blood samples were obtained during the mid-
follicular phase of the menstrual cycle after at
least 12 hours of fasting. Blood samples from
all subjects were separated immediately by
centrifugation at 4000Â g for 10min and
stored at À80C until analysis. Automated
chemiluminescence immunoassay systems
were used for measuring luteinizing hormone
(LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
total testosterone (ADVIA Centaur,
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Eschborn,
Germany), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate,
and sex hormone­binding globulin (SHBG)
(Immulite 2000 XPi, Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics). The free androgen index
(FAI) was estimated by dividing total testos-
terone (nmol/L) by SHBG (nmol/L) Â 100.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was
estimated indirectly with the Friedewald for-
mula.24 Total cholesterol, high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol, triglyceride, and
glucose levels were determined by colori-
metric-enzymatic methods (Siemens Advia
System, Deerfield, IL, USA). Intra- and
inter-assay coefficient of variation values
for these parameters were <5% and <8%,
respectively.
Glucose tolerance test
In all subjects, a 3-h oral glucose tolerance
test was used to evaluate insulin resistance
and b-cell function. After a 12-h overnight
fast, patients ingested 75g glucose, and glu-
cose and insulin concentrations were deter-
mined at baseline and after 30, 60, 90, 120,
and 180 min. For this study, we used only
fasting insulin and glucose to determine the
HOMA index. Insulin resistance was calcu-
lated using the HOMA-insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) formula: glucose (mmol/L) Â
fasting insulin (mU/L)/22.5.25 Fasting insu-
lin was evaluated using a chemiluminescence
immunometric assay and commercial kit
(Immulite 2000 Analyzer; CPC). Fasting
glucose was measured using a glucose oxidase
assay (Tosoh Corp., Tosoh, Japan).
Measurement of betatrophin
Fasting serum betatrophin levels were
assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorb-
ent assay (ELISA) kits (EIAab Science,
Wuhan, China; Catalogue No. E11644h).
The procedures were in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions. ELISAs were
performed in duplicate, and samples with
coefficient of variation values exceeding 5%
were excluded.
Statistical analysis
SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was
used for all analyses. Data are presented as
mean Æ SD or median [interquartile range].
Differences between groups were evaluated
using the unpaired two-tailed Student's
t-test for data with Gaussian distributions.
The Mann-Whitney U test was used to
compare group medians for data with non-
Gaussian distributions. Bivariate relations
between betatrophin levels and covariates
were analysed with Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient. A forward stepwise
multiple linear regression model was used to

test which variables were independent pre-
dictors of betatrophin level. We made fur-
ther subgroupings based on the presence of
insulin resistance, defined as a HOMA index
!2.4. Betatrophin concentrations were com-
pared between multi-groups with one-way
analysis of variance followed by LSD-t tests.
Data were considered statistically significant
at P < 0.05.
Results
Clinical and hormonal features of women
in the control and PCOS groups are
presented in Table 1. Age, blood pressure,
and SHBG, FSH, fasting glucose, total
cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels were similar between the groups.
As expected, women with PCOS had
higher LH, dehydroepiandrosterone sul-
fate, and total testosterone concentrations
and a higher FAI and LH/FSH ratio than
those of control women. Patients with
PCOS displayed significantly higher mean
fasting insulin levels and a higher mean
HOMA-IR and were more likely to be
insulin resistant (P ¼ 0.013).

Notably, betatrophin concentrations
were significantly higher in patients with
PCOS than those in control patients
(Table 1, P < 0.001). Further separation of
the subjects according to the presence of
insulin resistance revealed a significant dif-
ference in betatrophin concentrations
between the four groups (Figure 1). One-
way analysis of variance demonstrated sig-
nificantly different betatrophin levels
between the groups (F ¼ 21.14, P < 0.01).
Further analysis with the LSD-t test revealed
significantly higher betatrophin levels in
patients with PCOS and insulin resistance
compared with those in patients with PCOS
and control patients without insulin resist-
ance (832.7 Æ 98.2 vs. 775.5 Æ 66.2 pg/ml,
P ¼ 0.013 and 832.7 Æ 98.2 vs. 662.9 Æ
72.0 pg/ml, P < 0.001). However, betatro-
phin levels did not differ significantly
between control patients with insulin resist-
ance and those without (769.4.7 Æ 43.1 vs.
735.3 Æ 72.0 pg/ml).
To study the potential association
between PCOS and fasting insulin levels,
we further conducted a one-way analysis of
covariance using betatrophin levels as the
dependent variable, PCOS as the independ-
ent variable (two levels), and fasting insulin
as the covariate (data not shown). This
analysis (between-subjects factor: PCOS,
control) indicated that the main effect of
PCOS (F ¼ 0.115) was statistically signifi-
cant (F ¼ 7.03, P ¼ 0.013). Furthermore, the
main effect of insulin concentration was also
statistically significant (F ¼ 9.83, P ¼ 0.003),
but no statistically significant interaction
between the two factors was identified
(F ¼ 2.33).
Table 2 displays significant positive
correlations between betatrophin and
fasting insulin levels as well as HOMA-
IR (r ¼ 0.531, P < 0.001 and r ¼ 0.628,
P < 0.001, respectively), which were only
identified in patients with PCOS. However,
there were no statistically significant

correlations between any variable and beta-
trophin levels in the control group.
Finally, we used a multivariate linear
regression model of betatrophin levels in
patients with PCOS, including BMI, fasting
insulin levels, fasting glucose levels, HOMA-
IR, and FAI as independent variables.
Table 3 reveals that only HOMA-IR
remained significantly associated with beta-
trophin levels (P < 0.001) and was, thus,
concluded to be an independent predictor of
betatrophin concentrations.
Discussion
In the present study, our data demonstrated
that betatrophin levels were significantly
increased in patients with PCOS. When we
sub-grouped subjects according to the pres-
ence of insulin resistance, women with
PCOS and insulin resistance exhibited
higher betatrophin concentrations. A one-
way analysis of covariance demonstrated
that both fasting insulin levels and PCOS
diagnosis correlated with betatrophin levels.
Furthermore, betatrophin levels were sig-
nificantly correlated with fasting insulin
levels and HOMA-IR only in patients with
PCOS.
Betatrophin has recently been introduced
as a novel potent stimulator of b-cell repli-
cation and improved glucose tolerance by
increasing the b-cell division rate in mouse
models of insulin resistance.7 There is evi-
dence suggesting that betatrophin expres-
sion can be induced by a high-fat diet and

insulin, resulting in increased serum trigly-
ceride levels and insulin resistance instead
of improved glucose metabolism.13,26
However, several reports have indicated
that betatrophin was increased in T2DM
and type 1 diabetes mellitus,10­17 indicating
that betatrophin could be a potent diagnos-
tic biomarker for T2DM.27 Of note, a recent
meta-analysis demonstrated that circulating
betatrophin levels in patients with T2DM
were higher than those of non-diabetic
adults in the non-obese, but not in the
obese, population.8 This finding suggests
that betatrophin plays a role in the patho-
genesis of insulin resistance and T2DM. In
addition to T2DM, Ebert et al.15 determined
that women with gestational diabetes melli-
tus had significantly higher betatrophin
levels compared with those of healthy preg-
nant controls. Furthermore, gestational dia-
betes mellitus status positively predicted
circulating betatrophin levels. Additionally,
mounting evidence from recent animal-
based studies has suggested that betatrophin
associates with lipid metabolism. Mice lack-
ing betatrophin had a 70% reduction in
plasma triglyceride levels compared with
those of littermate control subjects.26
However, to date, no studies have examined
whether betatrophin is associated with
PCOS, though growing evidence has
suggested that insulin resistance and dysli-
pidaemia play critical roles in its
pathophysiology.
As indicated in this study, we determined
that circulating betatrophin levels were
markedly increased in Chinese patients
with PCOS compared with those in the
control group. Moreover, a Spearman rank
analysis demonstrated that serum betatro-
phin levels were significantly positively asso-
ciated with indexes of insulin resistance,
including fasting insulin levels and
HOMA-IR. These findings corroborate
those of a previous population-based study
that indicated that serum betatrophin levels
were elevated in patients with T2DM and
associated with insulin resistance.14
However, it is unclear whether increased
betatrophin expression is a compensatory
response or only a marker of insulin resist-
ance in PCOS. Notably, increased circulat-
ing betatrophin levels were identified in
women with PCOS and insulin resistance
but not in control women with insulin
resistance. Nonetheless, the increased beta-
trophin levels in subjects with PCOS are
interesting and raise the question regarding
the actual function of betatrophin, particu-
larly after recent reports confirming that
betatrophin does not affect beta cell expan-
sion in mice28 or humans.29 Additionally, it
is postulated that betatrophin as a novel
hormone may be involved in the generation
of an atherogenic lipid profile.18 However,
beyond glucose metabolism, we did not find
that betatrophin levels significantly asso-
ciated with the lipid profile. Therefore, it
would appear that different mechanisms are
involved in the regulation of betatrophin
levels in PCOS. However, we cannot exclude
the possibility that elevated betatrophin
levels may be associated with other etio-
logical factors in PCOS, which may affect
insulin resistance. In a recent study, Yi
et al.27 determined that betatrophin could
be a potent diagnostic biomarker for T2DM

in an indigenous Chinese population, imply-
ing that betatrophin might be the driving
cause of the disease. More studies are
required to determine the mechanisms
underlying the role of betatrophin in PCOS.
Similarly, Calan M et al.30 and Song S
et al.31 revealed that betatrophin levels were
higher in patients with PCOS than those in
the control group. Moreover, Calan M
et al.30 demonstrated a positive correlation
between betatrophin levels and HOMA-IR
in patients with PCOS and control subjects,
which is consistent with our present result.
However, Song S et al.31 determined that
serum betatrophin levels were negatively
correlated with HOMA-IR. Conversely,
Erbag G et al.32 in a small sample study (30
patients with PCOS and 27 without PCOS)
identified significantly lower betatrophin
levels in patients with PCOS. In the same
study, betatrophin levels displayed a strong
negative correlation with HOMA-IR. The
different findings may be related to the use of
different ELISA kits, different ethnic groups,
or the design and sample size of each study.
To evaluate which parameters were inde-
pendently associated with betatrophin levels
in PCOS, a multiple regression analysis was
performed. We identified HOMA-IR as the
only parameter that remained statistically
significant. We therefore conclude that insu-
lin resistance was the primary contributing
factor to elevated betatrophin concentra-
tions in this cohort of patients with PCOS.
Thus, betatrophin levels are evidence of a
PCOS-associated disorder rather than a
PCOS diagnosis, possibly indicating a state
of oxidative stress and inflammation, and
are strongly associated with insulin resist-
ance in patients with PCOS.
The limitations of the present study
included the relatively small sample size,
which precluded stratification of groups by
BMI for comparison, and the cross sectional
nature, which prevented us from establish-
ing causality. Another limitation in our
study is the lack of assessment of
betatrophin levels on different days of the
menstrual cycle in subjects. Therefore, fur-
ther studies are required to investigate the
associations between betatrophin levels and
clinical phenotype and pro-inflammatory
markers in normal-weight versus obese
women with PCOS, as well as to better
characterize betatrophin secretion through-
out the menstrual cycle.
In conclusion, we have provided the first
evidence that serum betatrophin concentra-
tions were markedly increased in patients
with PCOS compared with those of control
subjects. Our findings also suggest a possible
association between betatrophin levels and
PCOS. However, additional studies are
needed to elucidate the role of betatrophin
in PCOS development and determine
whether targeting betatrophin could hold
promise for PCOS treatment.
