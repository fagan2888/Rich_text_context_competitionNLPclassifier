investigational new drug safety
reporting process in oncology trials

Abstract
Background/aims: The Food and Drug Administration's final rule on investigational new drug application safety report-
ing, effective from 28 March 2011, clarified the reporting requirements for serious and unexpected suspected adverse
reactions occurring in clinical trials. The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative released recommendations in 2013 to
assist implementation of the final rule; however, anecdotal reports and data from a Food and Drug Administration audit
indicated that a majority of reports being submitted were still uninformative and did not result in actionable changes.
Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative investigated remaining barriers and potential solutions to full implementation of
the final rule by polling and interviewing investigators, clinical research staff, and sponsors.
Methods: In an opinion-gathering effort, two discrete online surveys designed to assess challenges and motivations
related to management of expedited (7- to 15-day) investigational new drug safety reporting processes in oncology trials
were developed and distributed to two populations: investigators/clinical research staff and sponsors. Data were col-
lected for approximately 1 year. Twenty-hour-long interviews were also conducted with Clinical Trials Transformation
Initiative­nominated interview participants who were considered as having extensive knowledge of and experience with
the topic. Interviewees included 13 principal investigators/study managers/research team members and 7 directors/vice
presidents of pharmacovigilance operations from 5 large global pharmaceutical companies.
Results: The investigative site's responses indicate that too many individual reports are still being submitted, which are
time-consuming to process and provide little value for patient safety assessments or for informing actionable changes.
Fewer but higher quality reports would be more useful, and the investigator and staff would benefit from sponsors'``filter-
ing'' of reports and increased sponsor communication. Sponsors replied that their greatest challenges include (1) lack of
global harmonization in reporting rules, (2) determining causality, and (3) fear of regulatory repercussions. Interaction
with the Food and Drug Administration has helped improve sponsors' adherence to the final rule, and sponsors would
benefit from increased communication with the Food and Drug Administration and educational materials.
Conclusion: The goal of the final rule is to minimize uninformative safety reports so that important safety signals can
be captured and communicated early enough in a clinical program to make changes that help ensure patient safety.
Investigative staff and sponsors acknowledge that the rule has not been fully implemented although they agree with the
intention. Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative will use the results from the surveys and interviews to develop new
recommendations and educational materials that will be available to sponsors to increase compliance with the final rule
and facilitate discussion between sponsors, investigators, and Food and Drug Administration representatives.

Introduction
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pub-
lished a ``final rule,'' effective from 28 March 2011,
clarifying the reporting requirements for serious and
unexpected suspected adverse reactions occurring in
clinical trials conducted under an investigational new
drug (IND) application (21 Code of Federal
Regulations part 312)1 and a related final guidance in
2012.2 The rule1 was intended to improve the quality of
safety reporting by reducing the number of uninforma-
tive reports generated by trial sponsors, allowing for
easier and quicker detection of true safety signals.
The final rule clarified that sponsors should only
generate expedited safety reports for individual cases of
serious, unexpected, and suspected adverse reactions
when the relationship of the drug to the adverse event
(AE) was clear because the event was one that is almost
always drug-related (e.g. Stevens­Johnson Syndrome).
In other cases, it implicitly required the sponsor to
review safety data collected across all studies in an
IND, analyze these data in the aggregate, and make a
judgment whether there is a reasonable possibility that
the drug caused the serious AE.
The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative
(CTTI), a public­private partnership that aims to iden-
tify and promote practices that will increase the quality
and efficiency of clinical trials, undertook two projects
to address the challenges associated with expedited
safety reporting.3,4 The first project developed recom-
mendations5 that offered an approach for sponsors to
monitor the safety of an IND throughout the develop-
ment program. FDA audit data of oncology trials has
indicated no change in report volume, despite FDA
guidance and CTTI recommendations, as illustrated in
Jarow et al.:6
... in a random audit of expedited safety reports, only 14%
(22/160) met the criteria of serious, unexpected, suspected
adverse reactions with the remainder not providing any
useful information for understanding the safety profile of
the investigational drug.
The second project (``IND Safety Advancement'')4
focused specifically on safety reporting in oncology
trials to determine barriers to and identify solutions for
compliance with the final rule. The IND Safety
Advancement Project aimed to identify (1) sponsor
challenges to full implementation and motivation to
change practice in order to fully comply with the final
rule and (2) challenges to investigator receipt and
management of safety reports. The goal of this study
was to gather evidence in order to characterize these
challenges. The results described herein will be used to
develop resources to support sponsors and investiga-
tors in creating the most efficient, informative, and
high-quality safety reporting system possible.
Methods
Oncology trials were the focus of investigation because
of the magnitude of issues with safety reporting in this
therapeutic area.6 In this article, ``safety reports'' refer
to expedited (7- to 15-day) IND safety reports that are
submitted to the FDA and clinical trial investigators.
Safety terminology is provided in Table 1.
Surveys
The project conducted two online surveys to assess
challenges and motivations related to management of
IND safety reporting processes; they were intended to
gather opinions rather than provide quantitative con-
clusions. One survey targeted clinical trial sponsors,
and one survey targeted investigative staff conducting
oncology clinical trials. CTTI members and contacts
identified by the project team were invited to partici-
pate. Investigators' responses were pooled and reported
separately from the pooled results of ``other trial staff.''
Survey recipients were able to freely forward it to oth-
ers; therefore, no data are available describing the num-
ber of potential respondents who had access to
complete the survey. The complete surveys for investi-
gators and sponsors are available in the online supple-
mentary material.
Survey questions were created and reviewed by mem-
bers of the CTTI IND Safety Advancement Project
Team (see section ``Acknowledgments''). The survey
was pilot-tested on a subset of the intended population;
however, no formal validation or internal consistency
checks were performed. The survey consisted of a com-
bination of demographic (Table 2) questions and ques-
tions aimed at understanding how IND safety reporting
is conducted at their site. The survey tools were not
configured to require a response to all questions in
order for the survey to be completed and submitted.
Participation was voluntary, anonymous, and uncom-
pensated. The survey was distributed via Constant
ContactÒ and completed through Qualtrics Version,
November 2014 (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Survey data
were collected from 18 November 2014 through 30
December 2014. Data were then aggregated by the
226 Clinical Trials 14(3)
Duke Center for Learning Health Care and distributed
to project team members for descriptive analysis.
Interviews
A total of 20 in-depth interviews were also conducted
to gather qualitative information about safety reporting
processes. The CTTI project team nominated interview
participants who were considered to have extensive
knowledge of and experience with the topic. Survey
respondents were also able to volunteer for interview
participation. In January and February 2015, 13 princi-
pal investigators and/or other research staff working on
oncology clinical trials and 7 pharmacovigilance leaders
from 5 large global pharmaceutical companies were
interviewed. The duration of each interview was
approximately 1 h and was conducted by a professional
interviewer using a pre-specified interview guide.
Sponsor interview questions focused on implementation
of the final rule by the sponsor, changes resulting from
the final rule, and ways that the expedited safety report-
ing system can be improved or clarified. Investigator
interview questions focused on the use of expedited
safety reporting at the interviewee's site and ways that
the process can be improved. The interview questions
for investigators and sponsors are available in the sup-
plementary material.
The surveys and interviews were designated as
exempt research by the Duke University Institutional
Review Board.
Expert meeting
CTTI products represent a consensus opinion among
selected experts in a particular field. In the case of the
IND safety reporting, experts included investigative
staff, sponsor representatives, and FDA members.
Survey and interview responses were reviewed and dis-
cussed by the CTTI project team and CTTI-affiliated
experts at an expert meeting held on 21­22 July 2015.8
The method for building consensus follows similar
guidelines as those used by the American Heart
Association,9 which encourages inclusiveness, account-
ability, and commitment to implementation. Once con-
sensus is achieved, these expert opinions are integrated
into CTTI products. Following release, CTTI hosts
educational lectures on how to implement the recom-
mendations. When appropriate, CTTI project team
works with experts to create tools (e.g. case study
examples, mock-ups of forms, templates for trial docu-
ments, and process maps) that can be adapted to a par-
ticular trial.
Results
Survey responses of investigative staff
Survey population and site characteristics. A total of 201
respondents participated in the online survey for inves-
tigators and research staff. Of which, 47 were principal
investigators or sub-investigators, and 154 represented
other investigative site staff. Other characteristics are
provided in Table 2.
Table 1. Safety reporting definitions.a
Term Definition
Adverse event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or
not considered drug related.
Adverse reaction Any adverse event caused by a drug.
Suspected adverse reaction Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For
the purposes of investigational new drug (IND) safety reporting, ``reasonable possibility'' means
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty than an adverse reaction.
Unexpected An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ``unexpected'' if it is not listed in the
investigator brochure, is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed, or, if
an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current
application, as amended.
Anticipated For the purposes of IND safety reporting, anticipated serious AEs are serious AEs that the
sponsor can foresee occurring with some frequency, independent of investigational drug
exposure, in the general patient population under study, in patients with the disease under
study, or both.
Serious An AE or suspected adverse reaction that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a
life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life
functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Analysis of similar events The sponsor must identify in each IND safety report all IND safety reports previously
submitted to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concerning a similar suspected adverse
reaction and must analyze the significance of the suspected adverse reaction in light of
previous, similar reports or any other relevant information.

Safety report workload and processing responses. Overall,
investigative staff survey respondents indicated that the
workload associated with processing safety reports is
substantial. Approximately 80% of sites receive more
than 20 safety reports monthly (the survey selection
with the highest number). More than 60% of investiga-
tors and staff reported that they spend more than 10 h
per month overall processing safety reports. In total,
20% of sites have refused to process IND safety reports
because (1) the institutional review board does not need
to review the same report, (2) the site was experiencing
workload issues, and (3) the report did not comply with
the FDA reporting rule.
The ``investigator survey'' also revealed variability in
investigator engagement with safety report processing.
In all, 72% of investigators and 84% of other trial staff
indicated that their site has a standard operating proce-
dure for the management of safety reports. A consistent
feature of these standard operating procedures is an ini-
tial review of the reports by the trial or regulatory coor-
dinator before submission to the principal investigator
(91%); however, 61% of investigators and 75% of
other trial staff reported that every safety report is still
sent to the principal investigator (Figure 1). Regarding
the observation that the reports are triaged and not
reviewed by principal investigator, responses indicate
that there is a disconnection between the perceptions of
investigators and other trial staff. Almost 70% of the
investigators polled reported that they review every
safety report submitted, whereas less than half (49%)
of other trial staff reported this to be the case.
Impact of the FDA final rule on safety report workload or
utility. Most surveyed investigators (54%) and staff
(63%) were aware of the final rule, and changes made
to safety reporting after the final rule was in effect
(72% investigators and 81% other staff). Regardless of
the respondents' knowledge of the final rule, 73% of
investigators and 54% of other staff reported no reduc-
tion in the volume of safety reports or change in the
quality of safety reports (80%­83%) over the past
year.
Safety reports that did not trigger protocol and/or
consent changes were overwhelmingly viewed as not
useful by investigative staff, as they rarely if ever influ-
enced patient management. Respondents who viewed
these reports as useful reported that the reports help
inform conversations with research participants about
new safety information. These sentiments were
re-iterated by the interview respondents.
Interview responses of investigative staff
A total of 13 experts from the investigative staff popu-
lation were interviewed to elaborate on safety reporting
issues. All interviewees thought the intent of the safety
reporting rule was laudable; however, none believed it
had achieved its goal. A key theme that emerged from
the ``investigator interviews'' was the lack of utility of
safety reports. Interviewees described the current sys-
tem of safety reporting as ``failed,'' in that it requires a
huge time commitment on the part of the investigative
sites without yielding useful information.

Many respondents indicated that handling safety
reports has become an exercise in ``just checking the
boxes.'' According to those interviewed, because inves-
tigators typically do not have enough time to thor-
oughly review all of the material, and do not find it
worthwhile, most sign off on the reports without
thoughtful consideration. Furthermore, responses indi-
cated that none of the investigators have ever used any
information from these reports to improve their trials
or make patients safer.
Summary of investigative staff's perceptions
Free-text responses from the investigative staff survey
identified many problems with the current state of IND
safety reporting, all around the recurring themes of
excessive volume and insufficient context. Problems
reported included the following: too many or duplicate
reports, overly time-consuming, individual reports have
little value, sponsors or data-monitoring committees
should review and only send unexpected and possibly
related reports, reports with excess detail can hide
important and useful information, not actionable (i.e.
not requiring changes to protocol or consent), and too
many websites to access.
Solutions proposed by investigators and trial staff
suggest greater adherence to the final rule with IND
safety reporting: only serious, unexpected, possibly
related AEs should be reported.
Sponsor survey responses
Sponsor survey population and organization characteristics. In
total, 29 respondents participated in the sponsor survey:
66% (n = 18) represented large biopharmaceutical
companies (US$10 billion in annual revenue), 10%
(n = 3) were employed by midsized biopharmaceutical
companies (US$1­US$10 billion in annual revenue),
and 24% (n = 7) were from small biopharmaceutical
companies (\US$1 billion in annual revenue). More
than half (n = 10) of the large companies had greater
than 50 active oncology trials; midsized and small com-
panies ranged from 11 to 30 active oncology trials. Of
those polled, a majority had a safety/pharmacovigilance
role in their organization (total n = 15). Regardless of
the size of the organization, all companies sponsored
trials across all phases of development.
Sponsors' perceptions of adherence to the final rule. A major-
ity of the respondents indicated that the pharmacovigi-
lance department was responsible for interpreting FDA
safety reporting requirements (63%) and for creating
organizational policy to implement the requirements
(58%).
From 2012 to 2014, the majority of organizations
generated greater than 1200 safety reports per year
(Figure 2). For large companies, 46% of respondents
reported no numerical reduction in reports; yet, when
qualitatively asked whether a reduction in the volume

Perez et al. 229
of initial safety reports was achieved after the rule was
made final, approximately 86% of large company
respondents indicated they had. Most indicated that
the volume of reports was reduced by 50%­75%, and a
few noted a reduction beyond 75%. In contrast, both
midsized and small companies reported no reduction.
In fact, some had an increase in the number of safety
reports in 2014 compared with 2012 (Figure 2).
Organizational barriers to full implementation of the final rule
according to sponsors. The main barriers to full imple-
mentation of the final rule were compliance concerns
with differing international regulations (n = 12) and
difficulties establishing thresholds for reporting
(n = 7). Infrastructural or technological limitations,
liability concerns, and a concern that the reduction in
reporting to the FDA would be interpreted as non-
compliance with regulations were also reported.
Respondents from large companies indicated that an
organizational change would be difficult (Figure 3).
Despite these barriers, many organizations have
implemented changes within their company to improve
adherence to the final rule, including pre-specification
in the protocol of anticipated/disease-related events,
submission of reports to FDA based on the sponsor's
determination of causality rather than relying solely on
the Investigator's assessment, technology enhancements
to enable compliance, standard operating procedures to
enhance compliance with final rule, filters to determine
clinically significant follow-up, and review of study
cases by physicians to determine causality instead of
defaulting to investigator causality.
Most sponsors recognize that full implementation
has not been achieved. Many large companies indicated
(n = 6) that they would benefit from pre-specifying in
the protocol which events are anticipated for the popu-
lation and/or disease under study, and therefore not
reportable, as suggested in the FDA guidance.
Additional changes suggested by respondents included
more interaction with the FDA to ensure clarity on the
final rule and greater alignment with other global regu-
latory bodies. Some respondents indicated they have
done everything possible to comply.
When questioned on the potential 90% reduction in
safety reporting volume estimated by the FDA follow-
ing adherence to the final rule, most survey respondents
thought this was unrealistic for several reasons, includ-
ing that a high volume of personnel involved in the
reporting process in large companies would need to be
trained and/or become comfortable with the new report-
ing standards, a lack of clarity on how to interpret the
Figure 2. Mean number of safety reports per year.

final rule and how follow-up reports should be treated,
and misalignment of global reporting requirements.
When asked what would help with implementation of
the final rule, respondents from large companies desired
more guidance from the FDA, more education for their
staff, and alignment with the European Medicines Agency
and other regulatory agency requirements.
Sponsor interview responses
Sponsor interview responses generally aligned with sur-
vey results. Many said that their companies reduced
the volume of individual safety reports by 40%­75%,
and two interviewees indicated that their organization
reduced the volume of reports by more than 90%. One
interviewee noted a decrease from approximately 1400
reports in 2013 to 200 reports in 2014; another cited a
reduction of 91% after speaking directly with the FDA
to clarify requirements. One respondent indicated no
decrease in reports due to the complicated nature of
determining causality with oncology therapies.
Interviewees expressed that the greatest challenges
with implementing the final rule were (1) lack of global
harmonization with reporting requirements, (2) deter-
mining causality with the investigational drug (espe-
cially in blinded studies), and (3) the burden associated
with performing an ``analysis of similar events.''
Lack of standardization in regulatory requirements
across countries with different reporting rules increases
the workload of the sponsor. One interviewee described
this challenge as the biggest challenge in drug safety,
especially when regulations for different regions contra-
dict one another.
Regarding determination of causality, most intervie-
wees indicated that they have used investigator bro-
chures to identify known adverse reactions that do not
meet the ``unexpected criteria'' and automatically
exclude those events from IND expedited reporting.
Yet, sponsors may still conservatively report events for
fear of regulatory consequences should they misjudge
causality. According to the interviewees, this approach
also prevents regulators from assuming that the com-
pany is ``concealing'' AEs. Furthermore, determining
causality may require that aspects of the trial or certain
data be unblinded, which sponsors prefer to avoid if
possible.

Perez et al. 231
Summary of sponsors' perceptions
Perceived and/or real challenges can be categorized into
regulatory, legal, technological, and organizational
issues (Table 3). Despite these barriers, most sponsors
believe the rule is reasonable and can reduce the num-
ber of uninformative safety reports. Some sponsors
focused on the estimated 90% reduction goal, stating
that this goal was unrealistic. Finally, respondents indi-
cated that sponsors may benefit from additional direct
interaction with the FDA to clarify nuances of the final
rule.
Discussion
Using surveys and interviews of clinical trial staff and
sponsors, CTTI identified some of the barriers for
implementation of the FDA final rule on safety report-
ing. The final rule is intended to minimize uninforma-
tive safety reports so that urgent, important safety
signals can be captured and communicated in a manner
that will ensure patient safety. Many stakeholders trust
that the safety reporting guidelines are being implemen-
ted appropriately, and that systems in place for safety
reporting are effective. However, results from this proj-
ect indicate that many investigators are still receiving a
high volume of reports that, in general, investigators
do not believe are valuable for ensuring patient safety.
In addition, ineffective implementation consumes time
and resources for activities viewed as not meaningful
(e.g. ``box-checking'').
One FDA audit reviewing 160 safety reports sub-
mitted to INDs in the Office of Oncology and
Hematology Products found that only 14% (22/160)
met reporting criteria while the remaining 86% of
reports were uninformative. Such data suggest that full
implementation by sponsors of processes to send only
reports required by the regulations could reduce the
volume of reports by as much as 90%. However, the
FDA acknowledges that this percentage is a general
estimation, that it may not apply to all sponsors, and
that the main concern is that the reports be informative
and of high quality. Moreover, the FDA emphasizes
that this estimation should not guide reporting deci-
sions, as the primary goal of the final rule is to improve
the quality and utility of safety reports.
Implementing a change in organizational processes
requires a cultural shift and considerable effort on the
part of the sponsor. Sponsors may choose to preserve
the status quo for several reasons: (1) an overly conser-
vative approach may prevent FDA audits, inspections,
and sanctions; (2) it will protect them from liability;
and (3) change is difficult, and personnel may be com-
fortable with the current standard operating proce-
dures. While some sponsors may still employ a
conservative approach, many believe that the final rule
is sensible, that it would help minimize uninformative
reports, and potentially improve their relationship with
investigators as a result.
Adoption of the final rule can be particularly chal-
lenging for large companies as it may require changes
to infrastructure. An electronic format may be more
time-efficient and practical10 than a paper-based for-
mat. In addition, resistance to change may stem from
lack of clarity. Although the FDA guidance on safety
reporting has clarified many points, some respondents
suggested more clarity on the consequences if a sponsor
determines that an event is not causally related to an
investigational drug but the FDA disagrees, the thresh-
old for aggregate analysis and reporting, and best prac-
tices for submitting ``other previously unreported
events,'' along with an expedited report.

In both the survey and interviews, investigative staff
offered several suggestions to improve the utility of
safety reports, including summaries of trending data
with conclusions, and reports of only AEs that are seri-
ous, unexpected, and probably related to the drug and
would trigger a change in protocol. Respondents who
had conversations with the FDA on the final rule found
those discussions very helpful and suggested that webi-
nar series or workshops with FDA officials be made
available to sponsors. Overall, there was a desire for
more direct interaction with the FDA in this capacity.
In 2013, CTTI released recommendations of best
practices for IND safety reporting;5 however, it was
clear that further information was needed. The authors
believe that results from this study are generalizable to
therapeutic areas other than oncology because although
the magnitude of the problem is especially challenging
in oncology,6 the principles for improving safety report-
ing are the same. In hopes of increasing compliance to
the final rule, CTTI plans to develop and release addi-
tional resources based, in part, on the results reported
in this article. In addition, CTTI-hosted webinars are
planned to educate attendees on specifics of the final
rule, present findings from CTTI's evidence-gathering
activities, and facilitate discussion between sponsors,
investigators, and FDA representatives.
Conclusion
Both the sponsor survey and the interviews highlight the
need for further clarity on the final rule in order to meet
the goal of reducing the number of uninformative safety
reports. Investigators offered potential solutions; how-
ever, the onus of implementing the final rule is on the
sponsors. Different sponsors have different viewpoints,
which may be influenced by the size and reach of their
organization; however, most sponsors agree with the
intention of the final rule. Yet, difficult challenges may
deter some sponsors from timely implementation of the
final rule. Findings suggest that the clinical trial enterprise
can benefit considerably from additional educational
materials on the final rule and proactive, bidirectional
communication between sponsors and the FDA in order
to clarify practical application of the final rule.
