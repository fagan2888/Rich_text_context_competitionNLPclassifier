Abstract: The aim of this study was to identify characteristics that predispose older resi-
dents of Adelaide to falling. Information collected in the baseline phase of the Australian
Longitudinal Study of Ageingwas used to draw cross-sectionalcomparisons between par-
ticipants who reported having fallen on at least one occasion in the previous 12 months
and those participants who reported not having fallen. The baseline cohort consisted of
1947 participants aged 70 years or more, of whom 550 (28 per cent) reported having
fallen at least once in the previous year. Independent risk factors for falling were: age;
having left school at an early age; a worsening of vision in recent years; and histories of
Parkinson's disease, fractured hip, glaucoma, stroke (including transient ischaemic
attack), corns or bunions, or arthritis. The findings regarding medical histories suggest
some possible opportunities for reducing the risk of falls in the elderly by managing the
symptoms and risk factors of underlying conditions such as stroke and loss of vision.

LS are the leading cause of accidental death
in Australians aged 65 years and older.' In this
E"
age group, falls accounted for 42 per cent of all
injury-related deaths registered in Australia in 1993;
numbering 694, falls deaths were more than twice as
frequent as transport or suicide deaths. Similarly,
data from public hospitals in Victoria show that falls
are the single most common cause of injury-related
hospital admission for persons aged 65 years and
over; over the period 1987 to 1993, falls accounted
for 42 per cent of all injury-related admissions in
Victoria (in the 65-and-over age group) and out-
numbered transport accident admissions by a factor
of nearly lo.*Fractures, particularly of the hip, are
the main reason for hospital admission following a
fall; many such fractures are associated with osteo-
poro~is.~,'
Additionally, older people suffer numerous falls
that do not result in hospital admission or death.
While accurate population-based numbers are not
available, many Australian and overseas researchers
have documented the frequency of falling among
their study participants."I3The prevalence of having
at least one fall in a year ranges from around 30 to
60 per cent of study participants. In general, the
reported prevalence tends to be higher in prospec-
tive studies employing good means of fall ascertain-
ment and in studies of older and frailer participants.
It is evident, therefore, that a considerable propor-
tion of the elderly population experiences falls.
While most of the falls do not lead to serious injury
or death, they are a cause for concern as likely mark-
ers of proneness to future falling, perhaps with
worse outcomes, and as indicators of deteriorating

health status. Other consequences of falls include
the effects of any minor injuries that are sustained
and the accompanying loss of confidence and inca-
pacitating fear of fallingwhich often followsin older
The frequency of falling among older people and
its serious sequelae have been recognised by health
authorities in Australia, and national goals and tar-
gets have been set with the aim of reducing levels of
falls-related mortality and hospital admission."
Achieving reductions in falls-related mortality and
morbidity can be tackled by various approaches,
including intervening to prevent falls occurring in
the first place and providing better clinical manage-
ment in cases where a fall has occurred and resulted
in injury. Successful intervention, with efficacious
targeting of at-risk persons, requires a better under-
standing of the causes of falls than is presently avail-
able.
There exists a broad body of literature on risk fac-
tors for falling (for an extensivebibliography see the
literature review by the Fall Prevention Research
Group in New Zealandla). Suggested risk factors
include poor state of health, limited mobility and fit-
ness, hazards in the home environment, dizziness
and disorders of balance, use of medications (espe-
ciallypsychotropic ones),and a history of falling.'a.lY
However, there are many contradictory findings
among studies over the predictive value of a wide
range of putative medical and environmental risk
factors. In part, this may be because studies of rela-
tively frequent health problems in elderlypeople are
prone to methodological difficulties, such as poor
recall of events, low participation rates, and incom-
plete follow-up owing to illness or death.zoAnother
reason for discrepant findings is the use of inade-
quate study designs to identify risk factors: common
problems that have been recognised include not
using a comparison group, and incorrectly ascribing

While several Australian studies have examined
correlates of falling in small samples of institution-
alised older s ~ b j e c t s ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
only two large-scale studies
of community dwelling people have been under-
taken, notably the Randwick Falls and Fractures
StudyZ5sz6
and the Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemi-
ology Study." These two studies found that persons
who experienced multiple falls tended to be identi-
fiable by their relatively poor performance in senso-
rimotor and balance tests. Given the uncertain
nature of the existing international literature and
the relatively small number of Australian studies of
community dwelling populations, a need exists for
further epidemiological study of risk factors for
falling within an Australian community setting.
The Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing
being conducted by the Centre for Ageing Studies at
the Flinders University of South Australia affords a
sound opportunity to explore the correlates of
falling in a sizeable cohort of older Adelaide resi-
dents, selected from both community and institu-
tional residences.28 This paper examines factors
associated with falling by drawing cross-sectional
comparisons between fallers and nonfallers, using
the baseline characteristics and experiences of the
cohort.
Method
This study of factors associatedwith falling is part of
the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing, details
of which are available elsewhere.2sBriefly, its aim is
to gain a better understanding of the determinants
of healthy aging and the role of social, environmen-
tal and biomedical factors in age-related changes in
the health of older people. The baseline cohort
comprised 1947 participants aged at least 70 years,
resident in Adelaide, South Australia (living either
in the community or in an institution), and selected
by age-and sex-stratified random sampling from the
electoral roll. The level of participation at baseline
represented a recruitment rate of 54 per cent.
Baseline data collection started in September
1992and was completed in March 1993.Participants
completed a comprehensive face-to-face interview
and underwent a series of home-based clinical
assessments. The survey collected information on a
range of sociodemographic, physiological and med-
ical items. Basic anthropometric measures included
height, weight, blood pressure, and assessment of
gait. Data were collected by trained interviewersand
collated by the Centre for Ageing Studies.
Participants were asked to report on whether any
falls had been experienced in the previous 12
months, and if so, to describe the circumstances that
led to their occurrence. Using this information, we
classified the cohort into comparison groups of fall-
ers and nonfallers. The criterion for classification as
a faller was one or more self-reported fallsin the pre-
vious 12 months; those who reported no falls were
classified as nonfallers.
Information on medical histories was obtained by
asking participants to identify from a list of 39 spec-
ified conditions those that they had ever suffered
from. For each identified condition, participants
were asked for the year of diagnosis and whether
they presently suffered from the condition. Ad-
ditionally, there was opportunity for participants to
report up to four other conditions not listed. Those
conditions diagnosed within the 12 months prior to
the baseline interview (0.2 per cent of all reported
medical histories) were excluded from analyses
because the onset of the condition might have been
after the occurrence of a reported fall.
Similarly, other potential risk factors were exam-
ined only if the exposure could not vary with time
(for example, sex, country of birth) or occurred
prior to the 12-month reporting period for falls.
Consequently, a number of potentially important
measures taken at the baseline stage of the study
(including blood pressure, weight, gait analysis,abil-
ity to perform activities of daily living, medication
usage, and psychological functioning) were not
analysed because their values might have reflected
the effects of a precedent fall and this would give
rise to misleading associations.The role of such fac-
tors will be examined prospectively in subsequent
stages of the study.
Odds ratios and their 95 per cent confidence
intervals were used as measures of the strength and
significance of associations between falling and pos-
sible risk factors. Age-adjusted odds ratios were cal-
culated from stratified analysis of unweighted data
using Epi Info oftw ware.'^ Multivariate unconditional
logistic regression analysis of unweighted data was
undertaken in accordance with the hierarchical
backward elimination procedure recommended by
Kleinba~m;~~
the SPSS computer program was used

Results
The baseline cohort consisted of 1947 participants,
1039 (53 per cent) men and 908 (47 per cent)
women. The age distribution for the two sexes is
shown in Table 1. Sixty-nine per cent of the cohort
was born in Australia and most cohort members
lived in the community,with only 8 per cent living in
institutional accommodation. Two-thirds of the par-
ticipants were known to be living with others at their
usual place of residence.
A total of 550 (28 per cent) participants reported
having fallen on at least one occasion in the previous
12 months (Table 1). Falls were more frequent
among women than men, with 31 per cent of women
compared to 26 per cent of men reporting at least
one fall. In both sexes the proportion of fallers
increased as age increased.
Age-adjusted analysis

medical conditions were examined for possible asso-

cohort were Parkinson's disease and hip fracture.
Among conditions not associated with falling were:
hypertension, heart attack, migraine, and chronic
bronchitis.
Physical factors and falling: The associations
between falling and a number of physical and
health-related factors are presented in Table 3.
Increasing age was associated with an increased risk
of falling;compared with participants aged 70 to 74,
those aged 85 and over had twice the odds of falling.
Women appeared to be at greater risk than men.
The relative odds of falling also increased with the
number of morbid conditions ever suffered and with
worsening vision. A history of ever having smoked
regularly appeared to decrease the risk of falling.
Socioeconomicfactors and falling: The age of leav-
ing school was the only socioeconomic variable asso-
ciated with falling (Table 4). While total income
from all sources (including that of a spouse) was not

factors in Tables 2 to 4 along with various other med-
ical histories as possible confounders, and age and
sex as effect modifiers (with corresponding first-
order interaction terms). A final model was
obtained by reducing the initial model in accor-
dance with Kleinbaum's hierarchical backward elim-
ination procedure.30
The independent risk factors to
emerge from the final model were: history of
Parkinson's disease,fractured hip, glaucoma, stroke,
corns or bunions, arthritis; increasing age; deterio-
rating eyesight; and lack of schooling or early age of
leaving school (Table5).Other variables retained in
the final model but not independently associated
with falling were sex, history of asthma, history of
ever having smoked regularly and marital status.
The final model also included a statisticallysignif-
icant first-order interaction term for sex by history of
asthma (improvement X
' = 4.9, 1 df, P < 0.03). For
men, a history of asthma appeared to increase the
odds of falling (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.56, 95
per cent confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 2.84),
whereas for women it appeared to decrease the odds
of falling (OR 0.60, CI 0.33 to 1.08).These sex-spe-
cific odds ratios did not achieve statistical signifi-
cance although the corresponding interaction term
made a statistically significant improvement to the
logistic regression model.

Discussion
As this work was part of a larger collaborativeproject
which set out to examine the broad determinants of
healthy aging, the nature of information and the
level of detail that could be obtained specificallyon
falls was limited. When considering the results of
this study,it is important to recognise the limitations
of the methods that were used. The main concerns
are: self-report of information on exposure and out-
come variables; modest response rate; relevance of
antecedent exposures; and aggregation of different
types of falls into a single outcome measure.
The exposure measures reported on in this paper
were all obtained by self-report, and this may have
resulted in some misclassification bias. To reduce
misclassification bias from underreporting of poten-
tially sensitive topics such as income and medical
histories, prompt cards were used during the per-
sonal interview. Past exposures may also have been
underreported simply because they were not
recalled by the elderly participants; this would have
produced nondifferential misclassification bias and
diminution of effects unless the pattern of recall was
associated with falling, in which case spurious asso-
ciations might have been produced.
The potential for misclassificationof exposure was
perhaps greatest for medical histories. In addition to
possible problems with recall such as those already
discussed,elderly people might not have been famil-
iar with medical nomenclature or with their actual

I AL.
diagnoses, particularly if they involved complex pat-
terns of disease or comorbidities. A further possibil-
ity is that some medical conditions might have been
overreported by those who thought the condition to
be a cause for their falling.While this possibilitycan-
not be ruled out, it is expected to have had at most
a small effect, since the questionnaire asked for
medical histories before it asked about falls experi-
ence, and participants did not know in advance that
they would be asked questions about falls. Although
self-reports have clear limitations, they potentially
could be used within a community or primary care
setting as a relativelyefficient first means of identify-
ing persons at increased risk of falling, with subse-
quent clinical follow-up to confirm medical
diagnoses.
Classificationof participants into groups of fallers
and nonfallers was based on self-reported falls expe-
rience, and is therefore subject to recall bias. Studies
have shown that while the number of reported falls
over a 12-month period is not particularly accurate,
recall of having experienced any falls versus zero
falls is reasonably reliable.z0,34
Misclassification
occurs predominantly in the direction of forgetting
falls as opposed to reporting falls that did not occur.
The usual effect of this type of misclassification is to
bias measures of effect towards the null value. In the
current study, the important outcome was whether a
fall had occurred rather than the exact number of
falls over the 12 months, and hence it is considered
unlikely that there was a significant misclassification
of outcome.
The recruitment rate at baseline (54per cent) was
similar to that achieved in the Randwick Falls and
Fractures Studyz6and in the Dubbo Osteoporosis
Epidemiology Studyz'but lower than in other stud-
ies of risk factors for falls among the elderly. In part,
the lower rate of participation may have been
because of the relatively high level of ongoing
involvementrequired of participants over the course
of the main study. In view of the participation rate,
findings from this study may not be generalisable to
all older Australians.
A difficultyfaced by all researchers who make use
of cross-sectional data or current data on exposures
combined with historical data on falling is to estab-
lish whether the temporal relationship between
these measures is consistent with a causal path. In
this paper, examination of risk factors was restricted
to stable exposures such as the age of leaving school
and the country of birth, and exposures that were
known to be antecedent to the falls experience
about which the participants were questioned (for
example, disease history, marital status). Even so,
further research will be needed to elucidate the
mechanisms by which such past exposures might
operate to bring about an increased risk of falling.
Different types of falls (for example, those result-
ing from slips, trips, sudden loss of consciousness)
were not distinguished in the analyses,as the level of
detail provided by participants was judged to be
insufficient to make useful distinctions. It is quite
probable that different types of falls have different
sets of risk factors, and the lack of risk specificitypro-
duced by grouping all falls together is likely to have
diminished some associations or possibly even
masked them alt~gether.*~,~~
A number of classifica-
tions for falls have been proposed and with further
evaluation may prove useful in revealingaetiological
risk factors hitherto obscured.l2
The results of this study indicated that histories of
Parkinson'sdisease, fractured hip, glaucoma, stroke
(including transient ischaemic attack), corns or
bunions and arthritis are independent risk factors
for falling. A history of anaemia was associated with
an increased risk of falling in the age-adjustedanaly-
sis but was displaced as a predictor when other fac-
tors were controlled for in the multivariate analysis.
In age-adjustedanalysis, there was a trend for risk of
falling to increase with the number of conditions
that had ever been suffered but this was not an inde-
pendent predictor. Other work has suggested that
the number of conditions and disabilities a person
reports may be a marker of poor health generally
and that such a state is associated with an increased
risk of falling.I5
Our finding that Parkinson'sdisease increased the
risk of falling in older people accords with the find-
ing of Nevitt et al.7The risk may be related to the
familiar symptoms of Parkinsonism, which include
tremor, muscular rigidity and difficultyin walking. A
history of hip fracture approximately doubled the
odds of falling. Given that past falling is a predictor
of future falling,'*and that falling is the usual mech-
anism underlying hip fractures, this association was
not unexpected. Arthritis has previously been iden-
tified as a possible risk factor for falling7A causal
relationship is plausible, in view of the degradation
of lower limb function caused by the deterioration
of joints in the lower limbs. Likewise, corns and
bunions may increase the risk of falling by interfer-
ing with normal gait. An appropriate mix of drug,
physical and occupational therapies is important to
maintain normal functioning in persons affected by
these conditions.
Problems with vision are known to increase the
chances of falling.7~z6
The results of this study con-
firm the importance of vision problems in relation
to falling. A history of glaucoma and self-identified
worsening of vision in the last five years were identi-
fied as predictors of falling in the multivariate analy-
sis. Early detection and treatment of glaucoma
before it causes loss of vision should be promoted as
an important public health issue particularly as the
benefits are likely to extend beyond healthy vision to
other areas such as reduced injury from falls.
The independent association of stroke with the
occurrence of falls is consistent with the findings of
several other The symptoms of this
paralysing disorder include vertigo, difficulty in
walking, and visual disturbances, all of which could
result in a fall. The risk factors for stroke are essen-
tially the same as those for other cardiovasculardis-
eases, and include hypertension, high cholesterol,
smoking and obesity. All of these risk factors have
received and are continuing to receive much atten-

tion in health promotion and disease prevention
efforts. Success in reducing these risk factors may
well lead to reductions in injuries from stroke-
related falls.
Age was an independent predictor of falling in
this study and has been found to be so in a number
of other Also in agreement with other
work was the finding that sex was not independently
associated with falling.'0,'' Smoking appeared to be
associated with a decreased likelihood of falling in
the age-adjusted analysis,but this associationwas not
present when other factors were controlled for in
the multivariate analysis. In view of the established
association between smoking and cardiovasculardis-
eases including stroke, it would appear unlikely that
a history of smoking would confer any protection
against falling.
Early age at leaving school was the only socioeco-
nomic variable that was an independent risk factor
for falling. Total income was not significantly associ-
ated with falling although there was an inverse rela-
tionship between it and risk of falling in the
age-adjusted analysis. It may be that educational
attainment (as measured by age at leaving school) is
a more sensitive indicator of lifetime economic dis-
advantage than the current total income of elderly
persons.36 Given that socioeconomic factors are
important determinants of the distribution of many
diseases, the results of this study tentatively suggest
that economic factors might play a role in the occur-
rence of falling. There were no apparent associa-
tions between marital status, country of birth or
English language ability and the occurrence of falls.
The final logistic regression model included a sta-
tistically significant interaction term suggesting that
sex might be an effect modifier in the relationship
between asthma and falling. Men reporting a history
of asthma had a statistically nonsignificant higher
risk of falling (OR 1.56, CI 0.86 to 2.84) while
women reporting a history of asthma had a statisti-
cally nonsignificant lower risk (OR 0.60, CI 0.33 to
1.08).Although different falls risk factors for men
and women have previouslybeen doc~rnented,'~
our
result must be treated with caution because of the
nonsignificance of the sex-specific odds ratios.
Few epidemiological studies in Australia have
addressed the causes of falls among older people liv-
ing in the community. This study provides informa-
tion about risk factors for falling which should be of
use to researchers and to those who are designing
and running trials of falls prevention programs in
Australia. The results of this study appear plausible,
are generally consistent with previous knowledge,
and add to the evidence regarding risk factors for
falls among community dwelling older people. A
number of disease conditions were identified as
likely risk factors, and in the case of stroke and con-
ditions that affectvision, a public health approach to
their prevention may also lead to fewer falls among
the elderly. Our cross-sectional baseline findings
need further confirmation and the longitudinal
phases of the Australian Longitudinal Study of
Ageing will provide an opportunity to extend this
work.
