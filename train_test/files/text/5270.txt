Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the association between plasma lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2
(Lp-PLA2; known to release inflammatory mediators that promote atherosclerosis) and coronary
heart disease (CHD) in Chinese patients.
Methods: This observational, cross-sectional study included a patient cohort who were assessed
by coronary angiography and divided into patients with coronary heart disease and patients with
normal coronary angiography (controls). Data for several biochemical indicators were collected.
Plasma Lp-PLA2 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyse the association between Lp-
PLA2 concentration and CHD.
Results: A total of 531 patients were included, comprising 391 with CHD and 140 with normal
coronary angiography (controls). Plasma Lp-PLA2 concentration was significantly higher in patients
with CHD versus controls (median, 251 mg/l versus 219 mg/l, respectively), and particularly among
patients with acute myocardial infarction and stable angina pectoris (249 mg/l and 266 mg/l,
respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that Lp-PLA2 ! 292 mg/l (upper quartile of the whole
cohort) was independently associated with CHD (odds ratio 2.814, 95% confidence interval
1.519, 5.214).
Conclusion: Plasma Lp-PLA2 concentration was independently associated with CHD in Chinese
patients.

Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD) has a signifi-
cant impact on human health, with a lifetime
risk of 67% in both males and females aged
>55 years.1 In 2008, CHD was responsible
for 12.7% of all deaths worldwide.2
Atherosclerosis is the pathological
basis of CHD,3,4 and the formation, devel-
opment, and rupture of an atherosclerotic
plaque involves inflammatory factors.5­8
Epidemiological studies of traditional mar-
kers of inflammation confirmed that inflam-
matory processes are associated with the
formation of coronary atherosclerotic pla-
ques and the occurrence of acute cardiovas-
cular events related to CHD.9­12 Vulnerable
plaques display a thin fibrous cap and a
sizeable, necrotic, lipid-rich core containing
a large amount of inflammatory and throm-
botic mediators, while stable plaques display
a thick fibrous cap.13 Plaque remodelling is
an ongoing process that involves many
factors.14,15
Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase
A2 (Lp-PLA2), a phospholipase enzyme
encoded by the phospholipase A2 group
VII (PLA2G7) gene, is a mediator of inflam-
matory reactions.16 Accumulating evidence
suggests a role of Lp-PLA2 in promoting
atherosclerosis. Lp-PLA2 was initially
recognized for its action in hydrolysing a
platelet-activating factor, and was first
named platelet-activating factor acetylhy-
drolase. Secreted by monocytes, macro-
phages, and T cells, Lp-PLA2 is a member
of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfam-
ily and comprises 441 amino acid residues
with a relative molecular mass of 45.4 kD.16
Following secretion, Lp-PLA2 enters the
blood circulation and binds to lipoprotein
particles, mainly low-density lipoproteins
(LDL; approximately 80%) and high-
density lipoproteins (HDL).17 Lp-PLA2
can generate pro-inflammatory molecules
such as lyso-phosphatidylcholine and
oxidized free fatty acids,16 and these
inflammatory factors promote atheroscler-
osis through several pathways.18 High levels
of Lp-PLA2 have been associated with an
increased risk of atherosclerosis.19­21
Although a relationship between the
PLA2G7 gene and CHD has been demon-
strated in the Chinese population,22­24 the
relationship between serum Lp-PLA2 levels
and CHD remains poorly understood in this
population. The aim of the present study
was to evaluate the association of Lp-PLA2
with CHD and coronary plaque stability in a
Chinese population, in an attempt to pro-
vide novel clues regarding atherosclerosis
development and eventual future thera-
peutic approaches.
Patients and methods
Study population
The present retrospective, observational
cohort study included consecutively enrolled
patients who underwent diagnostic coronary
angiography for evaluation of CHD at the
No. 2 Department of Cardiology, Tianjin
Chest Hospital, Tianjin, China between
February 2012 and July 2012. Patients
diagnosed with CHD and patients with
normal coronary angiography (control
group) were included.
Diagnosis of CHD was based on vascular
stenosis ! 50% in the left main artery, left
anterior descending artery, left circumflex
artery, and/or right coronary artery. The
following clinical indicators of CHD were
considered: (1) ischemic symptoms; (2) new
ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes
(new ST-T wave changes or new left bundle
branch block); (3) ECG pathological Q
waves; (4) imaging evidence of new loss of
viable myocardium or new regional wall
motion abnormality; and (5) coronary angi-
ography or autopsy confirmation of throm-
bus in the coronary artery.25
For subgroup analyses, patients with
CHD were further divided into those with

stable angina pectoris (defined as angina
during effort without evidence of recent
worsening, or angina at rest in the preced-
ing 3 months), unstable angina pectoris
(defined as the presence of angina at rest
that occurred during the preceding 48 hours
with significant transient ischemic
ST-segment and/or T-wave changes without
a significant increase in serum creatine
kinase level [Braunwald's class III-B]), or
acute myocardial infarction (defined as the
presence of >30 min continuous chest pain,
ST-segment elevation >2.0 mm on ! 2 con-
tiguous electrocardiographic leads, and
serum creatine kinase level >150 IU/dl).
Diabetes was diagnosed according to
diagnostic criteria of the China Guideline
for Type 2 Diabetes (2010 edition):26 (1)
patients with diabetes symptoms (including
typical symptoms such as polydipsia, poly-
uria, and unexplained weight loss) and (a)
random blood glucose (without considering
the last meal time, any time-of-day) blood
glucose >11.1 mmol/, or (b) fasting blood
glucose (fasting state at least 8 h without
calorie consumption) >7 mmol/l, or (c)
glucose 2 h following glucose load test
>11.1 mmol/l; and (2) in patients without
symptoms of diabetes, a repeated examin-
ation to obtain a clear diagnosis.
Hypertension was defined as systolic
blood pressure ! 140 mmHg and/or dia-
stolic blood pressure ! 90 mmHg, and/or
the use of anti-hypertensive drugs.
Patients meeting any of the following
criteria were excluded: (1) primary myocar-
diopathy, endocarditis, or severe valvular
heart disease; (2) coronary arteritis or
diseases that may cause non-atherosclerotic
coronary artery stenosis; (3) any autoimmune
disease; (4) acute or chronic infectious disease
within 2 weeks prior to study participation;
(5) severe liver or renal insufficiency such as
aminotransferase levels greater than twice the
upper limit of normal, or creatinine clear-
ance < 50ml/min; or (6) malignant tumour.
The study was approved by the ethics
committee of Tianjin Chest Hospital, and
written informed consent was obtained from
all patients.
Evaluation of coronary angiography
and coronary stenosis
Coronary angiography was performed
within 24 h of symptom onset using
a LAUNCHERÕ coronary catheter
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and
the standard Judkins technique.27 All
patients were routinely injected with 2 000
U of sodium heparin using a standard
transradial or femoral artery approach.
The visual method was used with an angiog-
raphy catheter as a reference (6 F angiog-
raphy catheter, 1 F ¼ 0.33cm) to estimate the
reference vessel diameter and pathological
segment diameter stenosis at the following
positions: left anterior oblique, 30; left
anterior oblique 30 þ head position, 30;
left anterior oblique, 45 þ foot position,
45; front right oblique, 30 þ head position,
30; right anterior oblique, 30 þ foot pos-
ition, 30; and other body positions.
Data collection and blood biochemistry
Data regarding smoking, alcohol consump-
tion, hypertension, and diabetes were col-
lected from all patients. Height, weight, and
body mass index (BMI) were measured.
Venous blood (10 ml) was collected prior
to coronary angiography. Blood samples
were allowed to stand at room temperature
for 30 min to allow clotting, then serum was
immediately collected and analysed for the
following parameters: serum total bilirubin,
total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL choles-
terol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C),
lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein A1, apolipo-
protein B, C-reactive protein (CRP), and
fibrinogen were determined. Biochemistry
analyses were performed using a
Yang et al. 161
MODULAR P-800 autoanalyser and asso-
ciated reagents (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland) according to the manufac-
turer's instructions.
Lp-PLA2 measurement
Prior to coronary angiography (and within
24 h of symptom onset), a 2-ml venous blood
sample was drawn from each patient into a
tube containing 1.8 mg/ml ethylenediamine-
tetra-acetic acid, and stored at 4C. Within
24 h of collection, blood samples were
centrifuged at 15 000 g for 10 min at 4C,
then plasma was collected and stored at ­
80C. Plasma Lp-PLA2 concentration was
measured using an enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Tianjin
Kangerke Bioscience, Tianjin, China)
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. ELISA results were measured using
an iMarkTM Microplate Absorbance Reader
(Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
Statistical analyses
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test was used to ana-
lyse data normality. Continuous variables
are presented as mean Æ SD or median
(interquartile range), as appropriate.
Independent Student's t-tests were used
to compare between-group means, and
three or more groups were compared
using one-way analysis of variance with
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple
comparisons. Categorical variables are
presented as n (%) prevalence and
between-group differences were analysed
using 2-test. Univariate and multivariate
logistic regression analyses were performed
to determine the factors independently asso-
ciated with the presence of CHD. All ana-
lyses were performed using SPSS software,
version 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Two-sided P values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 531 patients were included
(Table 1): 391 with CHD (median age, 62
years) and 140 with normal coronary angi-
ography results (controls; median age, 59
years). Compared with controls, patients
with CHD were older, showed a higher
prevalence of male patients, diabetes, hyper-
tension, and smoking (all P < 0.01), showed
higher levels of triglycerides, fibrinogen, and
CRP (all P < 0.01), and showed lower HDL-
C levels (P ¼ 0.002).
Plasma Lp-PLA2 levels were significantly
higher in patients with CHD than in con-
trols (median 250.6 versus 219.2 mg/l,
respectively; P ¼ 0.001). Among patients
with CHD, subgroup analyses of patients
with stable angina pectoris, unstable angina
pectoris, or acute myocardial infarction
revealed no statistically significant
between-group differences in terms of age,
sex, smoking, BMI, diabetes, or hyperten-
sion. A significantly higher proportion of
patients with unstable angina pectoris had
hypertension (P ¼ 0.035), and patients with
unstable angina pectoris had significantly
higher total cholesterol and HDL-C levels,
versus patients with stable angina pectoris
or acute myocardial infarction (P < 0.05;
Table 2). Patients with acute myocardial
infarction had higher CRP levels versus
patients with stable angina pectoris
(P < 0.001; Table 2), and a higher propor-
tion of patients with acute myocardial
infarction and unstable angina pectoris
were treated with probucol versus patients
with stable angina pectoris (P ¼ 0.001). In
addition, compared with Lp-PLA2 concen-
trations in the control group (median,
219.2 mg/l), Lp-PLA2 concentrations in
patients with acute myocardial infarction
or stable angina pectoris were significantly
higher (249.5 mg/l and 266.4 mg/l; P ¼ 0.046
and P ¼ 0.008, respectively; Figure 1).

Lp-PLA2 concentration is independently
associated with CHD
Risk factors for CHD were first assessed by
univariate analyses of variables (Table 3).
Variables with P values < 0.15 were then
included in a multivariate regression model
(Table 4). Among the cohort of 391 patients
with CHD, following adjustment for age
and sex, multiple regression analysis showed
that age (odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.09; P < 0.001),
male sex (OR 4.98, 95% CI 2.76, 9.01;
P < 0.001), diabetes (OR 3.59; 95% CI
1.89, 6.84; P < 0.001), CRP levels (OR
1.22, 95% CI 1.05, 1.43; P ¼ 0.012), and
Lp-PLA2 concentration ! 292 mg/l (upper
quartile of the whole cohort; OR 2.81;
95% CI 1.52, 5.21; P ¼ 0.001) were inde-
pendently associated with CHD (Table 4).
Discussion
In the present study, the association between
CHD and Lp-PLA2, a novel inflammatory
biomarker associated with atherosclerosis,
was investigated. Lp-PLA2 concentration
was found to be higher in patients with
CHD versus control patients with normal
coronary angiography. Multivariate ana-
lyses showed that Lp-PLA2 concentration
was independently associated with CHD in
the present population of Chinese patients
undergoing coronary angiography.

atherosclerosis, and is mainly produced by
inflammatory cells.20,28­30 Lp-PLA2 concen-
tration had been shown to alter considerably
during the early phase of acute coronary
syndrome;31 plasma Lp-PLA2 concentra-
tion decreased gradually in patients with
acute coronary syndrome over the first 3
days following hospital admission and then
remained stable. Long-term intensive ther-
apy with statins decreases Lp-PLA2 concen-
tration in addition to LDL-C levels, and
change in Lp-PLA2 has been correlated with
change in LDL-C.32­34 These studies suggest
that Lp-PLA2 plays an active role in the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and CHD.
Vulnerable plaques are associated with
Lp-PLA2, and higher Lp-PLA2 concentra-
tion is associated with more severe athero-
sclerosis, higher cardiovascular risk, and
more vulnerable plaques.35 By measuring
activity of Lp-PLA2 and lysophosphatidyl-
choline in the left main coronary artery and
coronary sinus,36 the role of Lp-PLA2 in
local vascular inflammation and early ath-
erosclerosis has been demonstrated; patients
with CHD were found to have higher Lp-
PLA2 activity and lysophosphatidylcholine
levels than controls. Lp-PLA2 is likely to be
an inflammatory biomarker in coronary
arteries, and probably has an effect on

atherosclerotic plaques and thus the devel-
opment of CHD.
Activity of Lp-PLA2 has been associated
with Framingham score.37 In addition to its
role in inflammation, Lp-PLA2 might be
directly or indirectly involved in plaque
remodelling,33 but the exact role of Lp-
PLA2 remains controversial. Specifically,
two studies have indicated that Lp-PLA2
could be cardioprotective because it hydro-
lyses platelet-activating factor and oxidized
phospholipids on LDL particles.38,39 In
addition, a recent phase III trial using an
Lp-PLA2 inhibitor reported no benefit in
patients in terms of secondary prevention.40
A Japanese study showed that Lp-PLA2
activity was associated with carotid plaques,
but a Mendelian randomization analysis
suggested that Lp-PLA2 was not a causative
factor for atherosclerosis.41 In the pre-
sent study, and in accordance with other
published studies,32­34,41,42 Lp-PLA2
concentration was independently associated
with CHD.
The present study results may be limited
by the following factors. The sample size
was relatively small and all patients were
from a single centre. In addition, the cross-
sectional study design did not allow for
determining a cause-and-effect relationship.
The observational nature of the study and
a number of uncontrolled factors could
have influenced the results. Therapeutic
drugs and natural supplements could also
have influenced the associations being
observed; unfortunately, data regarding
patient medication and supplements were
unavailable, due to the retrospective nature
of the study. Finally, despite presenting
with normal coronary angiography, the
control patients had a medical condition
that prompted the need for coronary angi-
ography, which may have biased the
results.

In conclusion, Lp-PLA2 concentration
was independently associated with CHD in
Chinese patients. Additional studies are
necessary to validate these results across
the spectrum of CHD.
