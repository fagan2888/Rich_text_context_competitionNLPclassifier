Introduction
All cultures recognize idealized images by which men and
women are judged as worthy members of their sex. These
images form an essential component of our body image, that
is, how we think, feel, and behave with regard to our physical
attributes (Grogan, 2007). The images we hold of our bodies
are not always accurate nor are they static; sensitive to
changes in mood, environment, and experiences, these
images are ever changing. Among the variety of social expe-
riences that potentially influence an individual's body image,
mass media has been most extensively studied. Media tech-
nologies (magazines, newspapers, television [TV], movies,
and now social networking websites) provide a platform to
portray, communicate, and construct how an ideal body
looks like. Although, both genders are exposed to ideal body
media images, studies report that women are more vulnera-
ble to body image disturbances than men (Makowski, Mnich,
Angermeyer, Löwe, & von dem Knesebeck, 2015).
Over the years, the Western media has propagated almost
unattainable body images as ideal for women. The unattain-
ability of the images is evident in the omnipresence of "size
0" models and celebrities in media who often resort to
extreme measures such as unhealthy diet, exercise or even
use of drugs or plastic surgery to maintain almost "sickly-
thin" body shape and size. Furthermore, the images we see
are often artificially enhanced by use of excess makeup and
computerized tools such as Photoshop (Field et al., 2005).
Unfortunately, these images are readily consumed by women
often without any awareness of the artificial nature of these
images, that is, women tend to engage in upward social com-
parisons processes (Festinger, 1954). Consequently, negative
self-evaluations made through social comparisons with
media dictated ideals often leads to self-deprecation, reduced
self-esteem, and in extreme cases, even eating disorders
(Thompson & Stice, 2001). Thus, ideal body images and
objectification of women as is done in the mass media, puts
women at risk for negative affect, body shame, body image
disturbance, eating disorders, and depression (Fredrickson &

The Struggle Between the Real and Ideal:
Impact of Acute Media Exposure on Body
Image of Young Indian Women
Itisha Nagar1 and Rukhsana Virk1
Abstract
Media, in its diverse forms, has become a powerful tool for construction and portrayal of the "shoulds, oughts, and musts"
of a woman's body. As a result of "thinning" of beauty ideals in the media, the real woman finds the representations of
ideal woman to be increasingly unattainable. This exploratory study examined the effect of acute media images for a sample
of young adult Indian woman (N = 60). A 2 (intervention group) × 2 (time) mixed-group design was used where half the
participants were presented with thin-ideal media images, whereas the other half were presented with control images.
The participants were examined on body image dissatisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and self-esteem. Results of the
study indicate a significant increase in thin-ideal internalization and body dissatisfaction and a significant decrease in self-
esteem scores as a result of exposure to the thin-ideal media images. The findings of the study indicate that, similar to their
counterparts in Europe and North America, young urban Indian women experience body image disturbances when exposed
to thin-ideal images. The findings have been examined in light of the spread of global media and homogenization of beauty
standards among non-Western countries.

Roberts, 1997). A bulk of correlational, prospective, and
experimental researches have supported the now largely
accepted truism that media contributes negative mental
health consequences for the women in the West (Stice, 2002).
In the context of globalization and the consequent prolifera-
tion of Western cultural ideals through global media, an
important question arises: How does the thin-ideal body
image affect women in non-Western countries such as India?
Previous studies examining the body image of urban and
educated Indian girls/women present a dismal picture.
Although epidemiological evidence is lacking with respect
to prevalence of eating disorders in India, a survey among
psychiatrists in Bangalore found that two thirds of psychia-
trists reported seeing at least one case of eating disorder,
indicating that eating disorders are not uncommon in urban
India (Chandra, Abbas & Palmer, 2012). Furthermore, emer-
gent studies indicate that an increasing number of women in
India display body image disturbances. For instance,
Goswami, Sachdeva, and Sachdeva (2012) reported high
body image dissatisfaction in a sample of college-going
young adult women. They found that overweight students
with high body mass index (BMI) had a significantly higher
prevalence of dissatisfaction relative to students with low
BMI. Bodily dissatisfaction was also reported in urban ado-
lescent Indian girls aged 14 to 19 years; not only were the
overweight girls dissatisfied with their bodies but also many
normal-weight girls perceived themselves as overweight and
attempted to lose weight (Som & Mukhopadhyay, 2015). In
a study that examined both school- and college-going girls/
women (16-21 years), researchers found that 86% of the par-
ticipants desired to be "slim." Furthermore, they reported
that a perception of a weight problem but not BMI contrib-
uted significantly to higher scores on General Health
Questionnaire, a psychiatric screening tool (Latha, Hegde,
Bhat, Sharma, & Rai, 2006). Dixit, Agarwal, Singh, Kant,
and Singh (2011) examined the role of age and urban living
as variables influencing bodily dissatisfaction in adolescent
girls (10-19 years); younger age groups and urban residents
expressed significantly more dissatisfaction relative to older
age groups and rural residents.
In addition to Indian sample of women, dissatisfaction
with body shape and size has also been reported for other
non-Western countries such as Fiji (Becker, Burwell, Herzog,
Hamburg, & Gilman, 2002), Croatia (Rukavina & Pokrajac-
Bulian, 2006), UAE (Eapen, Mabrouk, & Bin-Othman,
2006), and Korea (Jung & Lee, 2006). Given that many
underdeveloped and developing countries face severe nutri-
tional challenges affecting their physical and mental health,
existence of eating disorders and body image disturbances in
non-Western context is surprising. In addition, "thinness" is
usually not a traditionally ideal physical characteristic for
many Eastern cultures including India. This is because being
thin is seen as sickly, indicative of poverty, and a lack of
privileged upbringing. Thus, body image disturbance in non-
Western women is a special case that merits close attention.
Present Study
Indian magazines, movies, TV shows, and social media
have bombarded the 21st-century Indian women with
Western beauty ideals: fairness and thinness. For instance,
in spite of having a range of skin color, almost all Indian
actresses and models are (portrayed) overwhelmingly fair
skinned (Parameswaran & Cardoza, 2009). Kapadia (2009)
interviewed 26 Indian women who reported that social com-
parisons with friends and family members as well as
Bollywood actresses play a role in their dissatisfaction with
theory body shape and size. They also revealed that they
have noted a trend for women in Bollywood to become
slimmer over time. Indian media overwhelmingly portray
Western ideals when it comes to images of women. For
instance, even though MTV aimed to "Indianise" its pro-
gramming after it was introduced in 1994, Cullity (2002)
found that the channel promoted many Western values nota-
bly the beauty ideal of thinness.
The link between proliferation of Western beauty ideals
and rise of body image disturbances in non-Western
(Indian) women makes for an important topic of research.
Given the role played by this socioculturally acquired vul-
nerability on the general well-being of women, the need to
address this topic becomes pertinent. Therefore, the present
study aimed to explore the effect of exposure to acute thin-
ideal media images on college-going urban Indian women's
body image. Especially, the study examined the effect on
(a) thin-ideal internalization, (b) body dissatisfaction, and
(c) self-esteem of young Indian women. It was hypothe-
sized that the thin-ideal media images would lead to
increase in internalization of the thin-ideal, increase in
body dissatisfaction, and decrease in self-esteem of col-
lege-going urban Indian women.
Method
Participants
Sixty female students from different colleges in Delhi
between the ages of 18 and 22 were selected for the study.
All participants were randomly assigned to one of two con-
ditions: media intervention and control group. As can be
seen, the participants in the two treatment conditions were
matched on the following self-reported variables: age,
education, BMI, and social media consumption (Table 1).
An effort was made to minimize the influence of these
variables.
Design
A 2 (intervention group) × 2 (time) mixed-group design was
used. All participants were assessed twice: once before expo-
sure to the treatment condition (pretreatment) and once after
the treatment condition (posttreatment).

Materials
For the media intervention condition, the participants were
exposed to a video of models displaying the famous lingerie
brand, "Victoria's Secret." The video lasting a minute was
chosen to facilitate the aim of the study, that is, to examine
the role of Western thin-ideal media on body image of Indian
women. The video chosen shows lingerie models thereby
prominently displaying the thin beauty ideal. For the control
condition, a cartoon video was deliberately selected to avoid
any references to body image. Control participants were
exposed to a cartoon movie also for duration of 1 min.
Measures
The effects of intervention were observed on body dissatis-
faction, thin-ideal internalization, and self-esteem. The
measures used in the present study have also been used in
previous studies examining media-related body image
disturbances.
Body dissatisfaction.The Figure Rating Scale (Stunkard,
Sørensen, & Schlusinger, 1983) is an instrument used to
determine body dissatisfaction in males and females. The
scale comprises nine male or female schematic silhouettes of
varying shapes, ranging from extreme thinness to extreme
obesity. The respondent is required to select the silhouette
that she feels is reflective of her current body size and the
silhouette that represents her ideal body size. The discrep-
ancy between the two is considered the quotient of the
respondent's dissatisfaction with his or her body. As the scale
only makes use of figures and is nonverbal, it has been effec-
tively used to assess body dissatisfaction with non-Western
samples (e.g., Swami et al., 2010; Thomas, Khan, & Abdul-
rahman, 2010).
Thin-ideal internalization.
Thin-ideal internalization was
assessed using the Ideal Body Stereotype Scale­Revised
(Stice, 2001). It is an eight-item instrument that asks partici-
pants to indicate their level of agreement with six statements
concerning what attractive women look like, on a 5-point
scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. For
example, "Tall women are more attractive" and "Women
who are in shape are more attractive."
Self-esteem.The Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (Rosenberg,
1965) is a 10-item Likert-type scale that assesses global self-
esteem of an individual. The responses are answered on a
4-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
Examples of items include "I feel that I am a person of worth,
at least on an equal plane with others" and "On the whole, I
am satisfied with myself." High scores on this scale suggest
grater self-esteem.
Procedure
Informed consent was taken from all participants at the
beginning of the study and confidentiality and privacy were
ensured and maintained. Pretreatment data for all three mea-
sures­Figure Rating Scale, Ideal Body Stereotype Scale, and
Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale were collected from all partici-
pants. After 1 week, participants were randomly assigned to
one of two conditions. They were then shown the video clip-
ping associated with the condition. After a 5-min interval,
posttreatment measures were collected. The entire procedure
was done in person, in laboratory setting. Finally, debriefing
was done for all. It was ensured that there were no long-last-
ing effects of the media intervention.
Statistical Analysis
First, preliminary information regarding, age, education,
BMI, and social media consumption, collected from the par-
ticipants across two conditions, was compared to make sure
that there were no significant differences across the partici-
pants (Table 1). Second, descriptive statistics were obtained
noting ranges, means, and standard deviations for the depen-
dent variables. After which the data was screened for normal-
ity, outliers, fit between distribution and assumptions of
parametric statistics. Next, a 2 (intervention group) × 2 (time)
mixed-group ANOVA was used to determine effects of expo-
sure to the different treatment conditions on level of
body satisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and self-esteem.
Additional analysis using paired samples t test was performed
individually for both conditions (control and intervention) to
check for significant differences between the pretreatment
and posttreatment scores on each of the three measures.
Results
The 2 × 2 mixed-group ANOVA (Table 2) shows that group
by time interaction was significant for all the three measures,
indicating that the pattern of responses to media exposure
differed according to whether the participants were in the
media intervention group or the control group.

Table 3 shows paired samples t test indicative of a statisti-
cally significant increase in thin-ideal internalization and
body dissatisfaction along with a significant decrease in self-
esteem scores from pretreatment to posttreatment for the
media intervention group. That is, after viewing the images
of attractive models (thin-ideal), participants felt signifi-
cantly worse about their body. Furthermore, the significance
of difference across treatments was associated with large
effect sizes for all the three measures (Table 3). However,
there were no significant differences between pretreatment
and posttreatment on the three measures of body image for
the control group.
Discussion
The objective of the exploratory study was to investigate the
effect of acute media interventions on body dissatisfaction,
thin-ideal internalization, and self-esteem of urban Indian
females. The findings were in line with our hypothesis, that
is, acute exposure to thin-ideal media images was related to
body image disturbances. Furthermore, the findings repli-
cated previous work done on Western sample (e.g., Cattarin,
Thompson, Thomas, & Williams, 2000; Groesz, Levine, &
Murnen, 2002; Tiggemann & McGill, 2004) and helped in
empirically linking body dissatisfaction, self-esteem, and
thin-ideal internalization with media's endorsement of the
thin-ideal on an Indian sample.
Homogenized beauty ideals, specifically the hegemony of
Western beauty standards in non-Western countries (Brewis,
Wutich, Falletta-Cowden, & Rodriguez-Soto, 2011; Yan &
Bissell, 2014), has been attributed to be the reason behind the
increase of bodily dissatisfaction and increase in global prev-
alence rate of eating disorders (Gordon, 2001). In an interest-
ing study, Becker and colleagues (2002) examined impact of
the introduction of TV in a rural community in Western Fiji.
They reported that prior to the advent of TV, "thin" people
were considered to be sickly, incompetent, but advent of TV
has led to discontent with being "fat" in adolescent ethnic
Fijian girls. A recent large-scale study that surveyed over
7,000 individuals from 10 major world regions including
India, reported that BMI and Western media exposure pre-
dicted body dissatisfaction among women. Furthermore, the
study found that body dissatisfaction and desire for thinness
is commonplace in high socioeconomic status (SES) settings
across world regions (Swami et al., 2010). Erskine,
Whiteford, and Pike (2016) predicted that eating disorders
are going to "potentially rise" even in low- and middle-
income countries as a result of the cultural changes.
Today, an increasing number of young Indian women are
routinely exposed to Indian and Western media, which
embody the iconic thin-ideal and communicate uniform "you
cannot be too rich or too thin" belief (Cullity, 2002; Talukdar,
2012). Thapan (2004) examined samples of advertisements,
fashion photography, and selected textual material from the

Indian women's magazine Femina and found that the "new"
Indian woman is being rapidly constructed, shaped, and
redefined as a commercialized product along the lines simi-
lar to the images of women in the Western media. Negative
self-evaluations made as a result of upward social compari-
sons (Festinger, 1954) with these unattainable (Western) ide-
als--in the case of present study, extremely thin and beautiful
lingerie models--can lead to dissatisfaction and reduced
self-esteem (Engeln-Maddox, 2005). The Western beauty
ideals unattainable even for the Western women are excep-
tionally challenging for Indian women. Biological differ-
ences in terms of body shape, size, and skin color of their
ethnicities are often overlooked when an Indian girl com-
pares herself with a "size-0 White" model. Consequently, a
number of recent studies examining body dissatisfaction in
Indian adolescents and young adults have found that increas-
ing number of Indian women tend to experience negative
thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about their body size, shape,
appearances, and so forth (e.g., Goswami et al., 2012; Latha
et al., 2006; Som & Mukhopadhyay, 2015).
The findings are indeed disturbing in a society where
traditionally being thin was related to lower SES and being
fat communicated financial prosperity. Beauty ideals are
rapidly undergoing a change in response to the idealized
images of global womanhood. Thus, once thought to be a
"culturally bound syndrome" limited to Western popula-
tion, body dissatisfaction and eating disorders has become
a major concern for women across the globe. Any woman
falling short of the unrealistic ideals often finds herself ren-
dered psychologically vulnerable, struggling between the
real and ideal as the lines increasingly become blurred.
Thapan (2004) regarded this struggle as "recolonisation of
Indian woman's embodiment."
Limitations
The findings of the study need to examined in light of the
fact that the exploratory study had a small sample size con-
sisting of English speaking, university-educated representa-
tive of the urban middle-class population of Delhi National
Capital Region (NCR). Future researches should focus on
investigating the long-term effect of media images on differ-
ent population samples such as adolescent and preadolescent
girls from both urban and rural settings. In addition, the mea-
sures used have not been standardized on Indian population.
Implications and Conclusion
The findings of the study indicate that young urban Indian
women experience body dissatisfaction and reduced self-
esteem when exposed to Western thin-ideal images to the
same extent as their counterparts in Europe and North
America. Furthermore, the findings suggest that media
images of duration as little as a minute can lead to increased
acceptance (internalization) of socially defined ideals.
Although, the sample of the study was small, it is the first in
empirically linking media exposure and body image con-
cerns for an Indian sample.
