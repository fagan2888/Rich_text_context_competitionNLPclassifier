Introduction
Because most non-obstetric surgery and fetal intervention
procedures are performed during the second trimester of
pregnancy, and high concentrations of anesthetics (1.5
minimum alveolar concentration) such as isoflurane are
usually required to facilitate uterine quiescence and mini-
mize the risk of preterm labor during these surgeries,1 the
risks of fetal brains being exposed to anesthetic agents are
significantly increased. As the brain is developing in such
a "growth spurt" phase, neurogenesis, neuronal migration,
and corticogenesis are the major neurodevelopmental
events.2 Anesthetic agents administered can cause apoptosis-
mediated neurodegeneration and synapse loss, whereas
they increase synaptogenesis later in neurodevelopment.3­5
Recent studies based on rodents had demonstrated that
maternal anesthesia in the second trimester pregnancy for
several hours can induce neurodegeneration of the fetal
rats. In the second trimester of pregnancy, both the rodent
and human fetus show similar neurodevelopmental pro-
files.2,6 Therefore, more attention should be paid to the
neurodevelopmental consequences of the fetus during
maternal anesthesia in this phase.
In experiments of fetal rodents, the neurotoxicity of iso-
flurane is indicated in three ways. First, in results from
immunohistochemical tests, caspase-3 was raised signifi-
cantly in the hippocampus after exposure several hours
later, which suggests that abnormal apoptosis occurred.
Second, in results from behavior tests, anxiety-related
behaviors were changed and spatial memory abilities were
decreased in adulthood. Third, as observed by transmis-
sion electron microscopy, the number of synapses was
reduced significantly in the hippocampus in adulthood.
However, whether humans would undergo such changes is
still unclear.
Dexmedetomidine protects spatial
learning and memory ability in rats

Abstract
Background: The authors tested the hypothesis that combined use of dexmedetomidine on fetal rats during isoflurane
exposure in maternal anesthesia can attenuate the abnormal spatial learning and memory abilities in adults via the
renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system.
Methods: Fifty timed-pregnancy rats were randomly assigned to five groups (Dex+Iso, Sal+Iso, Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy, and
a control group ) on embryonic day 14 to receive five different dispositions, i.e. combined injection of dexmedetomidine
(Dex) or saline (Sal) and inhalation of isoflurane (Iso), oxygen (Oxy), or normal air for 4 h (n = 10).
Results: The latency time(s) from day 1 to day 4 all showed a decreasing tendency in all four groups. The synaptic count
of the Sal+Iso group was significantly lower than the Control group (p < 0.05), suggesting that severe neurodegeneration
occurred under the influence of fetal isoflurane exposure. In contrast, the synapse count of the Dex+Iso group was near
to that of Control group. The rats are protected in neurodevelopmental, normal development.
Conclusion: Combine use of dexmedetomidine during exposure to isoflurane in utero during middle-pregnancy can
attenuate the impairment of spatial learning and memory abilities for the rats in adulthood.

The neuroprotective function of dexmedetomidine
has been demonstrated in 5­7 days postnatal rats. But
there is still no evidence to show that dexmedetomidine
can attenuate the neurodegeneration induced by isoflu-
rane. Accordingly, we hypothesized that combined use
of dexmedetomidine in second-trimester-pregnancy
exposure to isoflurane in maternal anesthesia may have
adverse effects on the fetal brain that can attenuate the
abnormal spatial learning and memory abilities in
adulthood.
Materials and methods
Subjects
With the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee
(Guangdong Province), experiments were conducted on
50 Sprague­Dawley female rats (Medical Laboratory
Animal Center of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou,
China) and their respective offspring. The dams, weigh-
ing between 220 and 270 g, were housed in 60 × 40 × 20
cm3 polypropylene cages and exposed to a 12-h light­
dark cycle in a temperature- and humidity-regulated
room, fed with standard rat chow and water. Each dam
stayed with a male adult rat for one night before preg-
nancy, and pregnancy was assumed if sperm was found
on the vaginal smear at the next day morning. The preg-
nant rats were fed under the same conditions solely till
delivery.
Procedure for the dams
On embryonic day 14 (E14), 50 dams were randomly
assigned to five groups (n = 10), including Dex+Iso,
Sal+Iso, Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy, and control groups. For
gas inhalation, all dams were placed in a 20 × 12 × 12
cm3 organic glass chamber to inhale gas. The animals
randomly assigned to Dex+Iso and Sal+Iso groups
received 1.5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen for 4 h,
whereas animals in Sal+Oxy and Dex+Oxy groups
received 100% oxygen for 4 h in identical anesthetizing
chambers. The animals breathed spontaneously and the
isoflurane concentration was measured continuously
with an agent analyzer (Datex-Ohmeda, S/5 Compact
Anesthesia Monitor). This concentration of isoflurane
was referenced from the study by Arvind et al.7 which
reported that 1.4% isoflurane can cause significant spa-
tial memory impairment. Simultaneously, this concen-
tration approximates one minimum alveolar
concentration in the pregnant rodent.8 The control group
inhaled only normal air for 4 h.
For drugs injection, the animals randomly assigned to
the Dex+Iso and Dex+Oxy groups received dexmedetomi-
dine 10 g/kg (2 g/ml) by intramuscular injection at two
time points, including 15 min before inhalation and 2 h
after the start of inhalation. Animals in the Sal+Iso,
Sal+Oxy, and control groups received two doses of saline
at the same time points. The dose of dexmedetomidine was
referenced from the report by Sanders et al.9 which con-
cluded that dexmedetomidine 10 g/kg and 25 g/kg gave
significant neuroprotective effects while 1 g/kg has
almost no effect. In our pre-experiment, we initially set
two doses of dexmedetomidine. But during the procedure,
we found that dexmedetomidine 25 g/kg may induce
severe hypotension at subsequent isoflurane inhalation;
this consequence may lead to hypoxia of the fetal rat brains
and then affect the accuracy of our experiment. Although
1-adrenoceptor agonists such as phenylephrine can revert
the blood pressure, this may counterbalance the effect of
the 2-adrenoceptor agonist.10 and thus interfere the neu-
roprotective effect of dexmedetomidine. For this reason,
we only used a dose of 10 g/kg for dexmedetomidine in
our experiment.
After gas inhalation, the dams recovered in 100% oxy-
gen till the return of the righting reflex, and returned to
their cages. We injected the first dose of dexmedetomi-
dine 15 min before gas inhalation. This setting was cho-
sen by considering that the target organs of the drugs
were the brains of fetal rats. Because the lipid solubility
of dexmedetomidine is lower than isoflurane, it needs
more duration to pass the placental barrier and to onset at
the fetal brains. If both dexmedetomidine and isoflurane
are received simultaneously, neuroimpairment induced
by isoflurane may occur before neuroprotection by dex-
medetomidine. We expected that advanced injection of
dexmedetomidine can produce enough neuroprotective
effect before the impairment. In addition, we found that
the onset time of dexmedetomidine by intramuscular
injection may be more rapid than by intraperitoneal injec-
tion from the animal's behavioral response, and we con-
jectured that the onset time of neuroprotective effect may
be shorter if dexmedetomidine was administered by
intramuscular injection.
Furthermore, in our pre-experiment, 10 dams on E14
had a needle inserted through the arteria cruralis after
chloral hydrate intraperitoneal injection. Each of these
dams received all four methods above. Through the
needles, we monitored the continual arterial blood
pressures and took the blood samples for blood gas
analysis during the whole procedures. The result of
pre-experiment suggested that the dams can tolerate all
the methods well. No significant hypotension or heart
rate decrease occurred. Also, the blood gas analysis
results suggested no hypoxemia or hypoglycemia.
Considering the resistances of the rats without anesthe-
sia when faced with invasive procedures, and the inter-
ference if we used other anesthetics such as chloral
hydrate before the experiment, we did not monitor the
blood pressure and blood gas analysis directly during
our experiment.

Behavioral test
After delivery, each offspring was group-housed with the
corresponding dam until postnatal day 21, when pups were
weaned. One male and one female offspring of each dam
were used for the Morris water maze (MWM) test. All test-
ing sessions were performed between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. in
the same room, homogenously illuminated by normal fluo-
rescent room light at 50 lux. Animals were singly housed
till the end of behavioral test.
The MWM test was conducted in a pool with black
internal coating (120 cm diameter, 60 cm altitude) filled
with water (25°C). Animal movement was tracked using
viewer software (Smart 2.5) by a camera placed 2.5 m
above. The spatial cues were present around the pool, and
the pool was divided into four quadrants (northwest, north-
east, southeast, southwest). The test was divided into two
parts. For the spatial learning part, an escape platform (10
cm diameter) was placed in the second quadrant (2 cm
submerged; 30 cm from edge). Animals were trained to
find the location of the platform in four acquisition trials
(maximal swimming time 120 s; 30 s on the platform;
inter-trial interval 60 min) per day during four consecutive
days. If the rats could not find the platform in 120 s, they
were directed to the platform with a short stick. Starting
positions during the four trails day were: SE, SW, NW, and
NE. The latency time(s) to find the hidden platform from
the SE start position was scored. Latency time(s) repre-
sents the spatial learning ability. After the 120 s swim the
animals were placed back in their home cage, and a towel
was available inside the cage for additional drying. For the
spatial memory part, all animals performed a single probe
trial starting from the SE start position at day 5, in which
the platform was removed from the swimming pool.
Animals were also allowed to swim for 120 s. The time(s)
of first platform crossing (at the former platform location)
and the frequency of platform crossing were recorded.
First platform crossing time(s) and frequency of platform
crossing represent the spatial memory ability.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Hippocampal tissue were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde
for 1 h, treated with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated
and embedded in Durcupan (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples
were then sectioned (60 nm), mounted on Cu-grids, and
contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and
examined by electron microscopy (EM-1200EX,
JEOL).
Statistical analysis
All results were computed in SPSS 17.0. Measurement
data were expressed as mean±SD. Data for the latency
time(s) to find the hidden platform from day 1 to day 4 in
the MWM test were analyzed using two-way ANOVA
repeat measurements because of different time points. The
other data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, fol-
lowed by Tukey post hoc multiple comparison tests. In all
experiments, differences were considered statistically
significant at p < 0.05.
Results
Morris water maze test
The latency time(s) from day 1 to day 4 all revealed a
decreasing tendency in all four groups. However, in day 3,
the data in the Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy, and control group were
similar and all lower than the Sal+Iso group, while the data
for the Dex+Iso group did not show significant difference
to that for the Sal+Iso group or control group. In day 4, the
data in the Dex+Iso, Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy, and control
groups have no significant difference, but were all signifi-
cantly different to the Sal+Iso group. The data for the
Sal+Iso group were significantly longer than that of the
control group (Table 1).
The time(s) of first platform crossing and the fre-
quency of platform crossing in the Dex+Iso, Sal+Oxy,
Dex+Oxy, and control groups were similar, but all
showed significant difference to the Sal+Iso group. The
times of first platform crossing in the Sal+Iso group
were significantly longer than in the control group, and
the frequency of platform crossing in the Sal+Iso group
was also significantly lower than for the control group
(Table 2).
We analyzed the results obtained by electron micros-
copy. As shown in Table 3, we found that the synaptic

count of Sal+Iso group rats was significantly lower than
the for the control group, suggesting that severe neurode-
generation occurred under the influence of fetal isoflurane
exposure. In contrast, the synapse count of the Dex+Iso
group was nearly that of the control group, although there
were significant differences (p < 0.05). Thus, the rats were
protected in neurodevelopmental, normal development.
Discussion
Recently, growing evidence has shown that general anes-
thetics may be harmful at various stages of neurodevelop-
ment.11­13 The neurodegeneration induced by exposure to
isoflurane had both "short-term" and "long-term" influ-
ences. Wang et al. found that caspase-3 densities signifi-
cantly increased both in the hippocampal CA1 region and
retrosplenial cortex.14 Arvind et al. found that rats exposed
to isoflurane in utero may have impaired spatial memory
acquisition and reduced anxiety.7 Because E14­16 fetal
rats show similar neurodevelopmental profiles to human in
the second trimester of pregnancy,6,15 the period when
most non-obstetric surgery and fetal interventions are per-
formed, this sparked concerns for anesthesia safety.
Therefore, we expect to find a way to abate this damage.
Dexmedetomidine has been shown to exert potent neu-
roprotective effects by different mechanisms. First, dex-
medetomidine can attenuate the consecutively triggered
excitotoxicity by glutamate via the 2A-adrenoceptor
subtype in a model of neonatal excitotoxic rat brain dam-
age.16 Second, dexmedetomidine can reduce the abnormal
increase of caspase-3 density induced by isoflurane in the
developing brain.9 Third, dexmedetomidine increased
astrocyte expression of BDNF through an extracellular
signal-regulated kinase-dependent pathway and induced
subsequent neuroprotective effects.17 However, all these
evidences were based on experiments on neonatal rats; the
evidences on fetal rats had still not been reported.
We evaluated whether dexmedetomidine has certainly
neuroprotective effects by behavior tests, mainly because
we have no evidence yet available. Behavior is the most
important function of the body and is controlled by the
nervous system. The behavior of the experimental animals
would change subsequently with the environmental change,
and it can reflect the adapting ability and the neural func-
tion sensitively. Learning and memory are the inner psy-
chological behaviors of both humans and animals. These
processes occur in the brain and can only be speculated
indirectly by the determination of their operating results or
reaction time after learning or performing a task interval a
period. In our study, the MWM test was employed to evalu-
ate the spatial learning and memory abilities.
Although the use of isoflurane in human medicine is
now on the decline and replaced by sevoflurane, or desflu-
rane gradually, a certain proportion of using as an inhala-
tion anesthetic agent still exists for its uterus relaxation
effects. Furthermore, the neurodegeneration effects on
fetal animals induced by isoflurane have been widely
reported, while few are reported for sevoflurane or desflu-
rane. However, we needed an unquestionable neurodegen-
eration animal model to evaluate the protecting effect of
dexmedetomidine. So we still chose isoflurane as the
inhaling anesthetic agent.
From our MWM results, we find that the rats in all
groups show approximate spatial learning abilities
according to the similar data of the latency time(s) in the
first two days. But in day 3 and day 4, the latency time(s)
of the rats in Sal+Iso group were significant longer than
the Sal+Oxy, Dex+Oxy and control groups.
Simultaneously, the time(s) of first platform crossing and
the frequency of platform crossing were significantly dif-
ferent compared with these three groups. This suggests
that the spatial learning and memory abilities decreased
in the Sal+Iso group, and that serious neurodegeneration
had occurred in these rats. This result was consistent with
the conclusion made by Arvind et al.7 From the data for
the Dex+Iso group, although the latency time(s) in day 3
were between those of the Sal+Iso and control groups
and did not show any significant difference, the data in
day 4 and day 5 were similar to the control group and
significantly different to that for the Sal+Iso group. This
suggests that the impairment of spatial learning and
memory abilities induced by isoflurane had been attenu-
ated, even though the effect may not be thorough.
However, because we did not perform any biochemical or
anatomical tests, the way in which neurodegeneration

induced by isoflurane developed after combined admin-
istration of dexmedetomidine remains unclear.
We analyzed the results from electron microscopy. We
found that the synaptic count of Sal+Iso group rats was
significantly lower than for the control group, suggesting
that severe neurodegeneration occurred under the influ-
ence of fetal isoflurane exposure. In contrast, the synapse
count of the Dex+Iso group was nearly that of the control
group, although there were significant differences (p <
0.05). Thus, the rats are protected in neurodevelopmental,
normal development.
Oxygen has also been reported for neurotoxicity.18
But we had to use oxygen for it is the only driven air
source of our animal anesthesia machine. Similarly, a
great number of human anesthesia machines only use
oxygen and it is common practice to use 100% oxygen
during maternal anesthesia in humans. Further, the fetal
brain was probably not exposed to a high oxygen con-
centration because of the arterial­venous admixture in
the placenta. But we still set a group for only inhaling
oxygen, in order to rule out this interference in our
experiment. From the result, oxygen exposure in utero
did not lead to any significantly change of the behavior
of the rats in adulthood.
The safety of using dexmedetomidine in the second tri-
mester of pregnancy has been reported as being doubled in
some articles. The usage guide of the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) suggests that administering dexme-
detomidine subcutaneously to pregnant rats at 8 and 32 /
kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recom-
mended human intravenous dose based on a body surface
area comparison) from gestation day 16 through weaning,
lower offspring weights were observed. Also Öcal et al.
found that dexmedetomidine might increase the spontane-
ous uterine contraction-forces and contraction-frequencies
in early- and middle-pregnancy term rats in vitro (in Krebs
and Ca2+-free solutions), and consequently increase the risk
of miscarriage.19 However, Tariq et al. found that a single
acute dose of dexmedetomidine (20 g/kg) administered at
the anticipated delivery time does not exert any adverse
effects on perinatal morphology of pups,20 including their
birth weight, crown­rump length, physical growth, and
postnatal behavioral performances. Podocyte injury has
also been studied.21,22 However, in our experiment, none of
the dams suffered a miscarriage. Simultaneously, exposure
to a single dose of dexmedetomidine with oxygen did not
lead to any behavior abnormally in our results. So we
deduced that dexmedetomidine 10 g/kg is still a safe dose
for the pregnant and the fetal animals in the second trimes-
ter of pregnancy in vivo.
Recently, there have been a numbers of studies based
on neonatal rats that focus on how to attenuate the neuro-
impairment induced by anesthetic agents in the developing
brain. Liu et al. found that concurrent surgery and proce-
dural pain could attenuate ketamine-induced neuroapopto-
sis.23 Xenon could prevent isoflurane-induced neonatal
neuronal apoptosis.24 Unfortunately, the offspring in utero
may not all receive noxious stimulation and use of xenon
is limited by the special equipment and source required, so
that promotion of these conclusions is limited. By contrast,
dexmedetomidine is both conveniently and widely availa-
ble. Furthermore, the significant effect at attenuating the
impairments of spatial learning and memory ability is
worth a more thorough study. In our experiment, we were
limited at the behavior test and lacked the ability to explore
the mechanism. We expect that the mechanism of the neu-
roprotection by dexmedetomidine for fetal rats can be
studied subsequently.
