Context: Community epidemiological data on the preva-
lence and correlates of adolescent mental disorders are
needed for policy planning purposes. Only limited data
of this sort are available.
Objective: To present estimates of 12-month and 30-
day prevalence, persistence (12-month prevalence among
lifetime cases and 30-day prevalence among 12-month
cases), and sociodemographic correlates of commonly oc-
curring DSM-IV disorders among adolescents in the Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supple-
ment.
Design: The National Comorbidity Survey Replication
Adolescent Supplement is a US national survey of DSM-IV
anxiety, mood, behavior, and substance disorders among
US adolescents based on face-to-face interviews in the
homes of respondents with supplemental parent ques-
tionnaires.
Setting: Dual-frame household and school samples of
US adolescents.
Participants: A total of 10 148 adolescents aged 13 to
17 years (interviews) and 1 parent of each adolescent
(questionnaires).
Main Outcome Measures: The DSM-IV disorders as-
sessed with the World Health Organization Composite
International Diagnostic Interview and validated with
blinded clinical interviews based on the Schedule for Af-
fective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Chil-
dren. Good concordance (area under the receiver oper-
ating characteristic curve 0.80) was found between
Composite International Diagnostic Interview and Sched-
ule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-
Age Children diagnoses.
Results: The prevalence estimates of any DSM-IV disor-
der are 40.3% at 12 months (79.5% of lifetime cases) and
23.4% at 30 days (57.9% of 12-month cases). Anxiety dis-
orders are the most common class of disorders, followed
bybehavior,mood,andsubstancedisorders.Althoughrela-
tive disorder prevalence is quite stable over time, 30-day
to 12-month prevalence ratios are higher for anxiety and
behavior disorders than mood or substance disorders, sug-
gesting that the former are more chronic than the latter.
The 30-day to 12-month prevalence ratios are generally
lower than the 12-month to lifetime ratios, suggesting that
disorderpersistenceisduemoretoepisoderecurrencethan
to chronicity. Sociodemographic correlates are largely con-
sistent with previous studies.
Conclusions: Among US adolescents, DSM-IV disor-
ders are highly prevalent and persistent. Persistence is
higher for adolescents than among adults and appears to
be due more to recurrence than chronicity of child-
adolescent onset disorders.

MOST ADULT MENTAL DIS-
orders begin in child-
hood or adolescence,1
highlighting the im-
portance of under-
standing the onset and progression of men-
tal disorders among youths. Although
progress has been made in epidemiologi-
cal understanding of these issues,2 gaps
continue to exist. One such gap is that US
national data on the prevalence and cor-
relatesofchild-adolescentdisordersareun-
available. The US national prevalence es-
timates that exist have been derived from
dimensional ratings and service indica-
tors, but these are imprecise.3 Epidemio-
logical studies using structured diagnos-
tic interviews have been carried out in

regional samples, but these have limited generalizabil-
ity.4-6 One recent study assessed mental disorders in a US
national sample of youths, but this study included a re-
stricted number of disorders.7 More broad-based na-
tional data could help confirm findings from regional stud-
ies,setfutureresearchagendas,andinformfederalresource
allocation decisions for prevention and treatment.
The National Comorbidity Survey Replication Ado-
lescent Supplement (NCS-A) was carried out to fill these
gaps in epidemiological understanding as the first US na-
tional survey of adolescents to assess a wide range of
DSM-IV disorders using fully structured research diag-
nostic interviews. Previous reports described the NCS-A
sample design,8,9 measurements,10 validity of diagnostic
assessments,11 and reported lifetime prevalence and se-
lected sociodemographic correlates.12 This study pre-
sents new data on 12-month and 30-day prevalence and
on persistence of disorders. Extensive appendix tables
(http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/publications
.php) provide detailed sociodemographic data on sub-
sample disorder prevalence and persistence. In addi-
tion,apublicuseversionofthefulldeidentifiedindividual-
level NCS-A data set has also been made available for
secondary analysis. A companion article presents data on
12-month severity.13
METHODS
SAMPLE
Adolescents (aged 13-17 years) were interviewed between Feb-
ruary 5, 2001, and January 31, 2004, in dual-frame household
and school samples described elsewhere.8,9 The NCS-A house-
hold sample included 904 adolescents (879 students in school,
25 dropouts) from households in the National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication.14 The conditional adolescent response rate was
86.8%. The NCS-A school sample included 9244 adolescents
from a representative sample of schools in the adult sample areas.
The conditional adolescent response rate was 82.6%. The house-
hold sample, despite comparatively small size, is important be-
cause it includes school dropouts and adolescents residing in
areas where schools refused to participate. The nonparticipat-
ing initially selected schools (72.0%) were replaced with matched
replacement schools. Comparison of household sample re-
spondents from nonparticipating schools with school sample
respondents from replacement schools found no evidence of
bias in estimates of either disorder prevalence or correlates.8
One parent or surrogate (henceforth described as parents) of
participating adolescents was asked to complete a self-
administered questionnaire about the adolescent's develop-
mental history and mental health. The conditional response rates
were82.5%forhouseholdsamplesand83.7%forschoolsamples.
This article focuses on the 10 123 adolescents in school at
the time of survey, the subset of 6483 adolescent-parent pairs
with both adolescent interviews and parent questionnaires, and
the additional subset of 1987 pairs with adolescent interviews
and short-form questionnaires administered to hard-to-
recruit parents. Data for parent-adolescent pairs were weighted
to adjust for differences in measured variables compared with
incomplete pairs using methods discussed elsewhere.8,9 Writ-
ten parent informed consent and written adolescent assent were
obtained before surveying either adolescents or parents. Each
respondent was given $50 for participation. The recruitment
and consent procedures were approved by the human sub-
jects committees of both Harvard Medical School and the Uni-
versity of Michigan. Once the survey was completed, cases were
weighted for within-household probability of selection (house-
hold sample) and deviation from census population sociode-
mographic distributions, making each sample nationally rep-
resentative on the sociodemographic variables. The samples were
thenmergedwithsumsofweightsproportionaltorelativesample
sizes adjusted for design effects in estimating disorder preva-
lence. These procedures are detailed elsewhere.8,9 As docu-
mented in previous NCS-A reports,8,9 the weighted composite
sample sociodemographic and geographic distributions closely
approximate census population distributions.
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment
Adolescents in the NCS-A were administered the fully struc-
tured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)
modified to simplify language and use examples relevant to ado-
lescents.10 The DSM-IV and CIDI disorders assessed include
mood disorders (major depressive disorder or dysthymia, bi-
polar I or II disorder), anxiety disorders (panic disorder with
or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without panic disorder,
social phobia, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-
traumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder), behav-
ior disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, opposi-
tional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder), eating disorders
(anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating behavior), and
substance disorders (alcohol and drug abuse, alcohol and drug
dependence with abuse). There were no other exclusionary di-
agnoses. These disorders include all those assessed in most pre-
vious adolescent epidemiological studies.
All diagnoses were made using DSM-IV distress or impair-
ment criteria and organic exclusion rules. All but 2 were made
using diagnostic hierarchy rules, the exceptions being oppo-
sitional-defiant disorder with or without conduct disorder and
substance abuse with or without dependence. Adolescent in-
terviews assessed all disorders, while briefer parent question-
naires assessed only disorders for which parent reports have
previously been shown to play a large part in diagnosis: behav-
ior disorders15 and depression or dysthymia.16 Parent and ado-
lescent reports were combined at the symptom level using an
"or" rule (except in the case of attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder where only parent reports were used based on evi-
dence of low validity of adolescent reports). Exploratory analy-
ses showed that the use of this "or" rule optimized concor-
dance with diagnoses in the NCS-A clinical reappraisal study.11
Prevalence was assessed for 3 times: lifetime, past 12 months,
and past 30 days. Lifetime disorders were defined as present
whether they were or were not also present in the past 12 months
or 30 days. Twelve-month disorders were defined as present
whether they were or were not also present in the past 30 days.
Disorders with longer than a 30-day duration requirement were
defined as present in the past 30 days only if they had dura-
tions meeting the minimum DSM-IV requirement. Special prob-
ing procedures shown experimentally to increase recall of life-
time adult disorders17 were used to address the problem of
underestimation of lifetime prevalence in retrospective cross-
sectional surveys of adults17,18 and youths.1
An NCS-A clinical reappraisal study used licensed clini-
cians to interview adolescent-parent pairs by telephone with
the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
School-Age Children Lifetime Version.19 Diagnoses were made
from combined parent-adolescent reports and, as needed, rec-
onciliation interviews. Concordance was good between life-
time survey and clinical diagnoses, with areas under the re-

ceiver operating characteristic curves of 0.81 to 0.94 for fear
disorders, 0.79 to 0.86 for distress disorders, 0.78 to 0.98 for
behavior disorders, 0.92 to 0.98 for substance disorders, and
1.0 for bipolar disorder.11 Survey vs clinical absolute (ie, as a
proportion of the entire sample) prevalence differences of 1%
or more were found for 5 diagnoses: 1% to 2% for agorapho-
bia, illicit drug dependence, and major depression or dysthy-
mia, 4% for oppositional-defiant disorder, and 6.5% for spe-
cific phobia. Most of these differences represent large proportions
of the clinical prevalence estimates. The CIDI overdiagnosed
4 of these 5 disorders and underdiagnosed major depression
or dysthymia. That prevalence differences were smaller for the
other diagnoses shows that diagnostic thresholds are gener-
ally comparable for survey and clinical diagnoses. Parent and
adolescent reports both contributed to area under the curve when
both were assessed, with respective values based on adoles-
cent, parent, and combined reports of 0.75, 0.71, and 0.87 for
depression or dysthymia; 0.57, 0.71, and 0.78 for attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder; 0.71, 0.66, and 0.85 for opposi-
tional-defiant disorder; and 0.59, 0.96, and 0.98 for conduct
disorder.
Special caution is needed in interpreting 2 controversial di-
agnoses: bipolar disorder and agoraphobia without panic disor-
der. Consistent with concerns about diagnostic reliability20 and
clinical significance21 of bipolar II disorder, clinical reappraisal
data show that the CIDI has difficulty distinguishing bipolar II
disorder from subthreshold bipolar disorder among both adoles-
cents11 and adults.22 Second, controversy also exists about the va-
lidity23 andabilityoffullystructuredinterviewstodistinguishago-
raphobia without panic disorder from specific phobia.24
Sociodemographic Variables
The sociodemographic variables considered here include 6 of
the 7 used in the earlier NCS-A report on lifetime prevalence12--
age, sex, race/ethnicity, parents' education, family income, and
urbanicity--in addition to region of the country, number of sib-
lings, and birth order. Rather than consider the seventh so-
ciodemographic variable, marital status of parents, from the ear-
lier NCS-A article on lifetime prevalence, we consider the closely
related measure of number of biological parents living with the
respondent because we found this to be a stronger predictor of
disorder prevalence and persistence than marital status of par-
ents (detailed results are available on request). Taken to-
gether, these 10 sociodemographic variables include all those
examined in most previous epidemiological studies of child-
adolescent mental disorders.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Prevalence was estimated with cross-tabulations, and persis-
tence was estimated with 2 prevalence ratios (12-month preva-
lence among lifetime cases; 30-day prevalence among 12-
month cases). Sociodemographic correlates were examined with
logistic regression either in the total sample (to predict preva-
lence) or in subsamples of respondents with lifetime disorders
(to predict 12-month prevalence among lifetime cases) or 12-
month disorders (to predict 30-day prevalence among 12-
month cases). Logistic regression coefficients and their stan-
dard errors were exponentiated to create odds ratios (ORs) with
95% CIs. Standard errors were estimated using the Taylor se-
ries linearization method to account for sample weights and
clustering. Significance of predictor sets was evaluated using
Wald 2 tests based on the 44 NCS-A sample strata using Tay-
lor series coefficient variance-covariance matrices. These pro-
cedures were implemented using the SUDAAN software sys-
tem version 8.01 (Research Triangle Institute). Statistical
significance was consistently evaluated using 2-sided tests at
the  level of .05.
RESULTS
SAMPLE REPRESENTATIVENESS
As shown in more detail elsewhere,8,9 the NCS-A sample
is highly representative of the US population of adoles-
cents aged 13 to 17 years on a wide range of sociodemo-
graphic and geographic variables. Weighting did not have
a strong effect on these distributions (Table 1), indi-

jor sociodemographic and geographic segments of the
population.
PREVALENCE AND PREVALENCE RATIOS
The previous NCS-A article on lifetime prevalence re-
ported that more than half of respondents meet lifetime
criteria for any DSM-IV disorder.12 As shown in Table 2,
estimates of overall 12-month and 30-day prevalence are
40.3% (79.5% of lifetime prevalence) and 23.4% (57.9%
of 12-month prevalence). Rank-order correlations of
prevalence estimates across time frames are 0.91 (life-
time with 12 months), 0.85 (lifetime with 30 days), and
0.96 (12 months with 30 days). Separation anxiety dis-
order has the most dramatic variation in ranking (sev-
enth most common lifetime disorder and 14th most com-
mon 12-month and 30-day disorder), reflecting the fact
that separation anxiety disorder is the only disorder con-
sidered here that often resolves before adolescence. Anxi-
ety disorders are the most common class of disorders in
all time frames, followed by behavior, mood, and sub-
stance disorders.
Variation in prevalence rankings across time frames
means that disorders differ in persistence, a fact shown
more directly in the disorder-specific 12-month to life-
time and 30-day to 12-month prevalence ratios, al-
though it needs to be noted that even these ratios assess
persistence only indirectly given that duration of persis-
tence varies as a function of time since onset. In the ex-
treme case of respondents with first onsets in the 12
months before interview, 100% are considered persis-
tent in these ratios by definition. As a result, the ratios
have to be interpreted as suggestive rather than defini-

aAll disorders other than oppositional-defiant disorder and substance disorders are classified using DSM-IV diagnostic hierarchy rules. Oppositional-defiant
disorder is diagnosed with or without conduct disorder. Alcohol and drug abuse are diagnosed with or without dependence. While diagnoses of most disorders are
based exclusively on adolescent reports, parent reports are used to make diagnoses of major depressive disorder or dysthymia, oppositional-defiant disorder,
conduct disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The first 3 of these 4 disorders were assessed in the sample that completed the full parent
self-administered questionnaire (n = 6483), whereas attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was assessed in both the full self-administered questionnaire sample
and in the subsample of parents who completed the short-form self-administered questionnaire (n = 8470). As a result, prevalence estimates of any mood
disorder, any behavior disorder, any disorder, and number of disorders are based on 6483 cases.

tive. Nonetheless, the 12-month to lifetime ratios have a
wide range across disorders (from 20.9% for separation
anxiety disorder to 90.9% for social phobia) but a nar-
row interquartile range (66.0%-78.4%). That the lower
bound of this range represents nearly two-thirds of cases
suggests that most disorders are highly persistent dur-
ing adolescence. High persistence could be due to either
disorder chronicity or recurrence. To the extent that the
former is more important, we would expect the 30-day
to 12-month prevalence ratios to be higher than the 12-
month to lifetime prevalence ratios. The opposite is the
case, though, in the NCS-A data, with an interquartile
range of 32.7% to 43.7% for the 30-day to 12-month preva-
lence ratios vs 66.0% to 78.4% for the 12-month to life-
time prevalence ratios. Considered as classes, anxiety and
behavior disorders have much higher 30-day to 12-
month ratios (60.1% and 46.8%, respectively) than mood
(31.5%) or substance (31.2%) disorders.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES
The previous NCS-A report on lifetime prevalence exam-
ined6ofthe10sociodemographicvariablesconsideredhere
in predicting lifetime prevalence of classes of disorder and
any disorder.12 We focus here on associations of sociode-
mographic variables with individual disorders for each
prevalence time frame and ratio. Nearly one-third (30.3%)
of the resulting 640 associations (10 predictors of 15 dis-
orders for each of 4 time frames or ratios) are significant
at the =.05 (2-sided test) level in bivariate models, and
about one-fourth (26.4%) are significant in multivariate
models (Table 3). The highest proportions of significant
(bivariate and multivariate) coefficients are for 12-month
prevalence (43.7% and 36.37%, respectively) followed by
30-day prevalence (38.7% and 31.3%, respectively), with
much lower proportions significant for 12-month to life-
time (19.4% and 18.0%, respectively) and 30-day to 12-
month (19.4% and 20.0%, respectively) prevalence ratios.
The proportions of significant bivariate and multivariate
coefficients are similar for most sociodemographic vari-
ables, which means that multivariate controls do not have
dramatic effects on the estimates. The exceptions are par-
ents' education (40.0% and 23.7%, respectively), birth or-
der (32.5% and 17.5%, respectively), and number of sib-
lings (51.2% and 22.5%, respectively). We consequently
focus on multivariate associations, but we compare bivar-
iate and multivariate associations when they differ mean-
ingfully. Only summary patterns are reviewed here. How-
ever, complete results for all bivariate and multivariate
associations are available at http://www.hcp.med.harvard
.edu/ncs/index.php.
Age
Age is associated with 37.5% of 12-month disorders and
43.7% of 30-day disorders. The disorders not signifi-
cantly related to age mostly begin before adolescence (eg,
phobias, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) (R.C.K.,
S.A., E.J.C., J.G.G., K.A.M., N.A.S., A.M.Z., K.R.M., and
Matthew D. Lakoma, MPH, unpublished data, February
5, 2001, and January 31, 2004).25 The shape of signifi-
cant age differences is complex as some disorders are in-
versely related to age, others are positively related, and
others are highest at intermediate ages. Age is signifi-
cantly related to 18.7% of the 12-month to lifetime preva-
lence ratios and 37.5% of the 30-day to 12-month preva-
lence ratios, mostly involving negative associations (ORs,
0.1-0.6) of age with later-onset disorders.

nonsignificant for behavior and substance disorders.
Race/Ethnicity
Nearly one-third (31.2%) of multivariate associations be-
tween race/ethnicity and prevalence are significant, the
most consistent involving lower prevalence of behavior
and substance disorders among minority races/
ethnicities than non-Hispanic white individuals, with sig-
nificant ORs in the range of 0.2 to 0.8. Race/ethnicity is
related to a much smaller proportion (15.6%) of preva-
lence ratios, with no consistent sign pattern, which means
that race/ethnicity is generally not related to persistence
of disorders.
Family Socioeconomic Status
Half of the bivariate associations but only one-fourth of the
multivariate associations between parent education and
prevalencearesignificant.Themostconsistentpatternhere
is for higher prevalence of diverse disorders among off-
spring of parents with less than college education vs col-
lege graduates (ORs, 1.6-2.6). One-fourth of the multivar-
iate associations between parent education and prevalence
ratios are also significant, but the sign pattern is inconsis-
tent.Familyincomeissignificantlyrelatedto28.1%ofpreva-
lence estimates in bivariate models and 25.0% in multi-
variate models with inconsistent signs. A similarly
inconsistent sign pattern is found in associations between
family income and prevalence ratios.
Family Composition
Number of biological parents living with the adolescent is
the most consistently significant sociodemographic pre-
dictor of prevalence (65.1%). Prevalence is inversely re-
lated to number of biological parents in the household. Sig-
nificant ORs are mostly in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 in
predicting mood and anxiety disorders and 2.7 to 6.1 in
predicting behavior and substance disorders. Associa-
tions with prevalence ratios are less consistently signifi-

variate models, and 12.5% are significant in multivariate
models. The most consistent pattern is lower prevalence
of behavior disorders (conduct disorder, eating disorders)
among only children (ORs, 0.1-0.5 in bivariate models and
0.3-0.8 in multivariate models). Birth order among ado-
lescents with siblings, in comparison, is only rarely sig-
nificant. Associations of birth order with prevalence ra-
tios have no consistent sign pattern. Number of siblings
among those with any is significantly related to preva-
lence in 59.3% of bivariate models and 18.7% of multivar-
iate models. The significant associations (ORs, 0.1-0.5 in
bivariate models and 0.3-0.8 in multivariate models) al-
most entirely involve lower prevalence of diverse disor-
ders among adolescents with 1 vs 2 or more siblings. As-
sociations with prevalence ratios have inconsistent signs.
Geography
Urbanicity is significantly related to 12.5% of bivariate
and 6.2% of multivariate 12-month prevalence esti-
mates, most involving lower prevalence among respon-
dents in rural than urban areas (ORs, 0.3-0.7), and in-

aEach bivariate equation includes a single sociodemographic variable to predict 1 of the 16 DSM-IV or Composite International Diagnostic Interview disorders
in 1 of 2 time frames (12-month and 30-day prevalence) in the total sample or in 1 of 2 prevalence ratios in subsamples (12-month prevalence among lifetime
cases, 30-day prevalence among 12-month cases). This results in a total of 64 bivariate equations (each of 16 disorders in each of 4 time frames) for each
sociodemographic variable. Each multivariate equation includes all 10 sociodemographic variables to predict 1 of the 16 disorders in 1 of the same 4 time frames,
again resulting in 64 associations involving each sociodemographic variable. Sex is the only dichotomous sociodemographic variable. The others have either 3
categories (eg, 0, 1, or 2 biological parents living with the adolescent) or 4 categories (eg, residence in 1 of the 4 census regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, or
West), which were treated as a series of 2 or 3 dummy predictor variables in logistic regression equations. The statistical significance of each association was
evaluated using Wald 2 tests with c - 1 df, where c represents the number of categories in the predictor variable. The entries in the table represent the proportion
of times this 2 test was significant at the  = .05 (2-sided test) level using design-based significance tests. While diagnoses of most disorders are based
exclusively on adolescent reports, parent reports are used to make diagnoses of major depressive disorder or dysthymia, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct
disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The first 3 of these 4 were assessed in the full parent self-administered questionnaire (n = 6483), whereas
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was assessed in both the full self-administered questionnaire and the short-form self-administered questionnaire
(n = 8470). As a result, prevalence estimates of any mood disorder, any behavior disorder, any disorder, and number of disorders are based on 6483 cases.

sociodemographic variable associated with a much higher
proportion of multivariate 30-day prevalence estimates
(50.0%) than 12-month prevalence estimates (25.0%).
These associations largely involve lower prevalence of dis-
orders in the South than other parts of the country (ORs,

ratios.
COMMENT
Three noteworthy limitations of the NCS-A concern sam-
pling: (1) the school-level response rate was very low;
(2) the individual-level response rate was relatively low;
and (3) the sample excluded school dropouts, homeless
individuals, and non-English speakers. As we noted, meth-
odological analysis of the first limitation found no evi-
dence for bias due to school replacement.8 However, the
finding in previous methodological studies that nonre-
spondents have higher rates of mental illness than re-
spondents implies that the second limitation led preva-
lence estimates to be conservative26 and might also have
influenced estimates of persistence and correlates. The
exclusion of non-English speakers, who compose about
4% of the US adult population (http://factfinder2.census
.gov/), could also be at least partially responsible for the
failure to find strong associations of race/ethnicity with
prevalence of persistence.
Two other limitations concern measurement: (1) di-
agnoses were based on fully structured interviews and
parent questionnaires for a subset of diagnoses; and (2)
lifetime diagnoses were based on retrospective recall. Con-
cern about the first limitation is reduced by evidence of
good concordance with diagnoses based on blinded clini-
cal interviews,11 although prevalence estimates of simple
phobia and oppositional-defiant disorder are substan-
tially higher than those in the blinded clinical reap-
praisal interviews. The second limitation presumably led
to underestimation of prevalence, overreporting of per-
sistence, and possible distortion in estimates of corre-
lates, possibly in a differential way across disorders as a
function of differences in age at onset and severity.18
Despite the largely conservative limitations of the bi-
ases with respect to estimating prevalence, NCS-A preva-
lence estimates are at the upper end of the range of es-
timates in previous epidemiological studies. This likely
reflects the survey including more disorders than other
studies and using special recall probes.17 It is notewor-
thy that 2 disorders with among the highest prevalence,
specific phobia and oppositional-defiant disorder, were
overestimated in the CIDI.11 Prevalence estimates are most
similar to estimates in previous adolescent studies that
did not require special criteria for severe functional im-
pairment beyond DSM-IV distress or impairment require-
ments.27 Of note, our companion article13 reports that most
12-month disorders in the survey do not meet criteria
for a diagnosis of serious emotional disturbance (ie, a
DSM-IV disorder with a Children's Global Assessment
Scale score 50).28 Whether less severe disorders should
be included in future DSM editions is the subject of con-
troversy.29 As noted in the previous National Comorbid-
ity Survey Replication report on lifetime prevalence,12 the
fact that most disorder-specific lifetime prevalence esti-
mates closely approximate those of adults is consistent
with evidence that most adult mental disorders have first
onsets in childhood or adolescence.25
The 12-month to lifetime prevalence ratios of indi-
vidual disorders are considerably higher in adolescents
than among adults,25 presumably reflecting recent first
onset. The finding that 30-day to 12-month prevalence
ratios are generally lower than 12-month to lifetime ra-
tios is consistent with the possibility that high disorder
persistence may be due more to episode recurrence than
to chronicity, although differential recall could also be
involved. This pattern is also consistent with the longi-
tudinal pattern in the National Comorbidity Survey 2
panel sample. The higher 30-day to 12-month ratios for
anxiety and behavior disorders than mood and sub-
stance disorders suggest that the former disorders are more
often chronic than the latter, although differential recall
across disorders could also be involved. If we accept the
ratios as accurate, the finding that 30-day to 12-month
ratios exceed 50% for only 3 disorders (attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, specific phobia, and social pho-
bia) means that most active adolescent disorders are
asymptomatic for at least half the year. It is noteworthy
that the only 2 disorders with high values on both 12-
month to lifetime and 30-day to 12-month prevalence ra-
tios (specific phobia and social phobia) are both early-
onset chronic disorders (R.C.K., S.A., E.J.C., J.G.G.,
K.A.M., N.A.S., A.M.Z., K.R.M., and Matthew D. La-
koma, MPH, unpublished data, February 5, 2001, and
January 31, 2004), although we have no way to tell the
extent to which methodological factors account for this
pattern.
The results regarding sociodemographic variables are
largely consistent with previous research.4,30 Several find-
ings diverge from previous research, though, and point to
potentially valuable areas for further inquiry. For one, we
did not replicate the regional finding that Hispanic indi-
viduals have higher rates of depression than non-
Hispanicwhiteindividuals,31 raisingthepossibilityofurban-
rural, regional, or socioeconomic differences that need to
beexploredinmoredetailedanalyses.Inaddition,thefind-
ing that girls have a more persistent course of mood and
anxiety disorders than boys is consistent with some32 but
not other33 previous studies, raising the possibility of in-
formative specifications to explore in further analyses.
Another interesting deviation from previous findings
involves family socioeconomic status. Our finding that
parental socioeconomic status is inversely related to preva-
lence, although broadly consistent with previous stud-
ies,34,35 differs in 2 important ways from earlier findings.
First, previous studies largely focused on parental in-
come, whereas we found the strongest association with
education and no consistent income effect after control-
ling for education. Second, earlier studies documented
especially high rates of disorder in the lowest socioeco-
nomic strata (ie, living in poverty), whereas we found
especially low rates at the highest socioeconomic strata
(ie, parents graduated from college). Further analysis of
joint education-income effects are needed to reconcile
these differences.

The strongest sociodemographic correlate was num-
ber of biological parents living with the adolescent. This is
consistent with previous research,36 but the causal dynam-
ics are unclear. Although a genetically informative design
would be needed to investigate relative influences of genes
and environment,37 further analyses of our data might be
useful in refining understanding of component associa-
tions involving the presence and timing of parental mari-
tal disruption, single parenthood, and family stressors.
In summary, the results reported here suggest that
DSM-IV disorders are highly prevalent and persistent
among US adolescents. The results also support retro-
spective findings in adult studies that most adult disor-
ders begin in childhood or adolescence. A number of well-
known adult sociodemographic correlates of disorders
are found here to exist among adolescents. A compan-
ion article documents differentiation among adolescent
disorders in patterns and predictors of severity (R.C.K.,
S.A., E.J.C., J.G.G., K.A.M., N.A.S., A.M.Z., K.R.M., and
Matthew D. Lakoma, MPH, unpublished data, February
5, 2001, and January 31, 2004). Taken together, these
findings provide a strong rationale for continuing to pri-
oritize research to understand the development of ma-
jor mental disorders during the first 2 decades of life.
