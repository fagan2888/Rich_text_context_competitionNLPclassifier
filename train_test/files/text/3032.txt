National Trends in the Use of Antibiotics by Primary
Care Physicians for Adult Patients With Cough
Joshua P. Metlay, MD, PhD; Randall S. Stafford, MD, PhD; Daniel E. Singer, MD
Background: Increased antibiotic use for outpatient ill-
nesses has been identified as an important determinant
of the recent rise in antibiotic resistance among com-
mon respiratory pathogens. Efforts to reduce the inap-
propriate use will need to be evaluated against current
trends in the outpatient use of antibiotics.
Objectives: To examine national trends in the use of
antibiotics by primary care physicians in the care of adult
patients with cough and identify patient factors that may
influence antibiotic use for these patients.
Methods: This study was based on a serial analysis of
results from all National Ambulatory Medical Care Sur-
veys beginning in 1980 (when therapeutic drug use was
first recorded) to 1994 (the most recent survey year avail-
able). These surveys are a random sampling of visits to
US office-based physicians in 1980, 1981, 1985, and an-
nually from 1989-1994. Eligible visits included those by
adults presenting to general internists, family practition-
ers, or general practitioners with a chief complaint of
cough. A total of 3416 visits for cough were identified
over the survey years. Survey results were extrapolated,
based on sampling weights in each year, to project na-
tional rates of antibiotic use for patients with cough. Ad-
ditional analyses examined the rates of antibiotic use strati-
fied by patient age, race, and clinical diagnosis.
Results: Overall, an antibiotic was prescribed 66% of the
time during office visits for patients with cough: 59% of
patient visits in 1980 rising to 70% of visits in 1994 (P =
.002 for trend). In every study year, white, non-Hispanic
patientsandpatientsyoungerthan65yearsweremorelikely
toreceiveantibioticscomparedwithnonwhitepatientsand
patients 65 years or older, respectively.
Conclusions: The rate of antibiotic use by primary care
physicians for patients with cough remained high from
1980 to 1994, and was influenced by nonclinical char-
acteristics of patients.

OVER THE past few years,
substantial concern has
accompanied the docu-
mented rise in antibi-
otic resistance among
common respiratory pathogens.1-5 Initial
work primarily focused on the preva-
lence of resistance among hospitalized pa-
tients but more recently has expanded to
identify antibiotic-resistant pathogens in
several ambulatory care settings.6-9 Addi-
tional evidence has linked prior antibi-
otic use with the identification of antibi-
otic-resistant pathogens.6,9,10 As a result,
several authors11-16 have emphasized the
importance of more appropriately regu-
lating the use of antibiotics for common
outpatient illnesses as a means to combat
the problem of rising antimicrobial resis-
tance. Whether these efforts at improv-
ing physician knowledge about the risks
of excessive antibiotic use will ultimately
lead to any reductions in antibiotic use is
unknown. However, an understanding of
current trends in antibiotic prescribing will
be useful for interpreting any future trends
in antibiotic use.
This study focuses on the use of anti-
biotics for patients presenting with cough
ratherthanpatientsdiagnosedashavingspe-
cific acute respiratory diseases. In the pri-
marycaresetting,achiefcomplaintofcough

assigned to these patients is imprecise and
may well be driven by the choice of thera-
pies, an important source of confounding
in the measurement rates of antibiotic use.

the ambulatory care setting. Additional work19 based on
this survey demonstrated that as recently as 1992, most
patients diagnosed as having colds, upper respiratory tract
infections, and bronchitis were treated with antibiotics.
We hypothesized that this pattern of rising antibiotic use
would be even more apparent in the management of pa-
tients with cough, despite the recent increase in aware-
ness regarding the rise in antibiotic resistance. The spe-
cific aims of this study were (1) to examine national trends
in the use of antibiotics by primary care physicians in the
care of adult patients with cough and (2) to identify fac-
tors that may influence antibiotic use for these patients.
RESULTS
RATES OF VISITS TO PRIMARY CARE
PHYSICIANS FOR COUGH
The frequency of visits to primary care physiciansbyadults
with a chief complaint of cough rose steadily from 1980
through 1994. In the United States, there were an esti-
mated 5.5 million office visits for cough in 1980 rising
to 10.2 million office visits in 1994 (P.001 for trend)
(Table 1). Over this period, the number of total office
visits to primary care physicians remained relatively con-
stant (225 million in 1980 and 219 million in 1994). As
a result, the proportion of visits to primary care physi-
cians by adults with cough nearly doubled from 2.5% of
all visits in 1980 to 4.7% in 1994. Of note, cough was listed
as a nonprimary reason for visit much less commonly and
thefrequencyoflistingcoughasasecondaryortertiaryrea-
son for visit did not demonstrate a similar increase in fre-
quency during the study period (data not shown). During
this study period, the frequency of other primary reasons
for visits did not demonstrate the same pattern of in-
crease. For example, sore throat represented 2.6% of pri-
mary care visits in 1980 and 2.3% of visits in 1994. Head
cold represented 2.0% of visits in 1980 and 1.6% of visits
in 1994, and a chief complaint of lung congestion or chest
cold represented 0.3% of visits in 1980 and 0.4% of visits
in 1994. Finally, 58% of visits with a chief complaint of
cough included additional reasons for visit. The leading ad-
ditional reasons for visits were nasal congestion, fever, and
sore throat, representing 12.5%, 8.5%, and 7.4% of all vis-
its, respectively.
Most patients who presented with cough were
women (60%), younger than 65 years (73%), and white,
non-Hispanic (82%). Fifty-two percent of the patients had
been previously seen by the surveyed physician for the
same problem. The race and sex distribution of patients
METHODS
DATA SOURCE
Data for this study were from the NAMCS for 1980, 1981,
1985, and 1989-1994.20 Conducted in these years by the
National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Md, these
surveys provide an ongoing assessment of the practices of
US office-based physicians, including both urgent and sched-
uled visits. We began with 1980 because it was the first sur-
vey year in which drug prescribing information was in-
cluded at each sampled visit. We included all subsequent
NAMCS survey years through 1994, the most recent year
available at the time of this study. The sampling process
makes use of the American Medical Association and Ameri-
can Osteopathic Association master lists of all US primary
care physicians. A sample of physicians from these lists was
then selected by random, stratified sampling by geo-
graphic area and specialty. Among eligible physicians, an-
nual participation rates varied from 72% (1992) to 78%
(1981). For each participating physician in each year, pa-
tient visits during a randomly selected week were sampled
systematically.
For each selected patient visit, physicians completed
encounter forms detailing the specific clinical services pro-
vided during the visit, as well as patient demographics, rea-
sons for visit, and diagnoses. The first listed reason for visit
and first listed diagnosis represent the principal reason for
visit and associated principal diagnosis, respectively. We
chose to focus on cough as the principal reason for visit
because of its explicit linkage to the principal diagnosis,
thus permitting a better understanding of the clinical in-
dications for antibiotic use. In fact, secondary reasons for
visits were listed in only 37% of all visits and a third rea-
son for visit was listed in only 11% of all visits to primary
care physicians. Continuing and newly ordered over-the-
counter and prescribed medications also were listed for each
visit. For each visit record, the National Center for Health
Statistics provided a visit weight calculated from the phy-
sician and visit sampling rates, adjusted for nonresponse.
Statistical aggregation using these visit weights allows ex-
trapolation to national patterns of practice.
We restricted this study to visits by adults (aged 18
years) to primary care physicians, defined as physicians iden-
tified in 1 of the following 3 American Medical Associa-
tion categories: internal medicine, family practice, or gen-
eral practice. This portion of the NAMCS database includes
from 5627 (1993) to 19 977 (1985) annual outpatient vis-
its by adults to primary care physicians.
VARIABLE CODING
Visits by adults to primary care physicians for cough were
identified based on the coding of patient reason for visit.
Those visits in which cough was coded as the first (pri-
mary) reason for visit were identified as primary care vis-
its for cough. A total of 3416 visits by patients with a chief
complaint of cough were identified: 431 in 1980; 335 in
1981; 555 in 1985; 378 in 1989; 487 in 1990; 412 in 1991;
234 in 1992; 264 in 1993; and 320 in 1994.
Patients receiving antibiotic therapy were identified
by the coding of generic or proprietary names for all anti-
biotics in the following classes: penicillins, cephalospor-
ins,macrolides,tetracyclines,quinolones,andtrimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole drugs. We did not exclude parenteral
forms of antibiotics, although they contributed only a small
proportion of all antibiotics prescribed since only outpa-
tient visits are included in the NAMCS.
Primarydiagnosesforpatientswithvisitsforcoughwere
identified based on the International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)21

did not change significantly during the study years. In
contrast, there was a slight increase in both the propor-
tion of visits by patients 65 years or older (23% in 1980
to 29% in 1994; P = .03 for trend) and the proportion of
visits by patients previously seen for cough (42% in 1980
to 51% in 1994; P = .004 for trend).
The relative distribution of primary diagnoses for pa-
tientswithachiefcomplaintofcoughdidnotchangemuch
during the study years (Table 2). In particular, bronchi-
tis, including acute bronchitis and bronchitis not speci-
fied as acute or chronic, remained the leading diagnosis in
each study year (average, 42% of visits). Other leading di-
agnoses included upper respiratory tract infection, asthma,
sinusitis, and pneumonia. Fifty-nine percent of the visits
for cough had only a single diagnosis listed.
RATES OF ANTIBIOTIC USE
FOR PATIENTS WITH COUGH
The number of antibiotics prescribed as a result of visits
for cough to primary care physicians increased over the
survey years from 1980-1994, in parallel to the increase
in frequency of visits for cough (Table 1). The lowest an-
nual number of antibiotics was prescribed for cough in
1981 (5 128 000 annual prescriptions) and the highest
annual number of antibiotics was prescribed in 1992
(11 440 000 annual prescriptions).
The average rate of antibiotic use for patients with
a chief complaint of cough was 66% of office visits dur-
ing the entire study period. Although the measured rate
of antibiotic use showed considerable year-to-year varia-
tion, the use of any antibiotic for patients with cough dem-
onstrated a statistically significant increase during the
study period (P = .002). The 3 highest rates of use were
in 1991, 1992, and 1994 (70% of visits) compared with
the 3 lowest rates of use in 1980 (59%), 1985 (61%), and
1993 (63%) (Table 3).
INFLUENCE OF PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS
AND CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS ON ANTIBIOTIC USE
In every survey year, physicians prescribed antibiotics for
younger patients more often than for older patients. For
example, in the most recent year (1994) physicians pre-
scribed antibiotics for cough 74% of the time for pa-
tients aged 18 to 44 years, 72% of the time for patients
aged 45 to 64 years, and 63% of the time for patients 65
years or older. Similarly, white, non-Hispanic patients
were more likely to receive antibiotics compared with all
other patients in each study year. There was no differ-
diagnostic code listed as the first diagnostic code for each
visit. Based on the frequency of ICD-9-CM codes, we iden-
tified the following primary diagnoses for visits by pa-
tients with cough: bronchitis, acute or not otherwise speci-
fied as acute or chronic (ICD-9-CM codes 466 and 490),
influenza (code 487), acute upper respiratory tract infec-
tion (code 465), acute nasopharyngitis (common cold) (code
460), acute and chronic sinusitis (codes 461 and 473), bac-
terial pneumonia (codes 481-483 and 485-486), asthma
(code 493), and acute pharyngitis (code 462). We coded
the cough visit as an initial visit for the problem or a fol-
low-up visit based on whether the physician identified the
primary reason for visit as a new problem (or a first visit
with the patient) or as a problem for which they had pre-
viously seen the patient.
A number of patient characteristics reported in the
NAMCS were evaluated to determine their association with
antibiotic use. Particular characteristics that were tested in-
cluded patient age (categorized as 18-44 years, 45-64 years,
and 65 years), sex, and race and ethnicity (categorized
as white, non-Hispanic vs other).
DATA ANALYSES
National estimates of the number of visits by adults to pri-
mary care physicians for cough and the number of antibi-
otics recorded at those visits were calculated based on the
sampling weights provided by the National Center for Health
Statistics. For each estimate, a 95% confidence interval was
calculated based on the relative SEs provided in the docu-
mentation for each survey year. These relative SEs are pro-
vided for visit estimates and drug estimates for individual
physician specialties. Because our study of primary care phy-
sicians merged 3 specialties (internal medicine, family prac-
tice, and general practice) in each year, we chose the larg-
est relative SE associated with one of these specialties to
determine the confidence intervals around the aggregated
sample. As recommended by the National Center for Health
Statistics, significance of linear trend for the annual fre-
quency of visits for cough and the annual frequency of an-
tibiotic drug prescriptions at these visits was based on a 2-
sided t test for trend, incorporating the relative SEs for each
year in the calculation.22
National patterns in the rate of patients with cough
receiving antibiotics were assessed by cross-tabulation of
medication information by year of visit, weighted by the
National Center for Health Statistics visit-sampling weights.
Rates of antibiotic use were expressed as the proportion of
visits for cough in which any antibiotic was listed. Both un-
adjusted and adjusted tests for significance of trends over
the study years were based on logistic regression analysis
with the natural logarithm of the odds of antibiotic use in
patients with cough as the dependent variable. These analy-
ses were performed with SAS statistical software (Release
6.11, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) using modified sample
weight to reflect the actual-sampling probabilities of each
visit and the original sample size of the final study group.
In the logistic regression analysis, calendar year was en-
tered as a continuous variable to test for significance of lin-
ear trend.
All analyses used the patient visit as the unit of analy-
sis and did not adjust for the clustering effect within indi-
vidual sampling units (eg, physician practices) because
unique physician identifiers were not available for this study
for years prior to 1991. However, using general estimating
equations and the physician identifiers for years 1991-
1994 demonstrated that adjustment for the clustering ef-
fect in those years had minimal effect on the parameter es-
timates and increased the SEs for each predictor by 20%
to 30%. Moreover, the mean number of office visits by pa-
tients with cough to the sampled population of primary care
physicians was only 2.2 (median, 2).

ence in the rate of antibiotic use for male and female adult
patients (Table 3).
We next considered the potential influence of phy-
sician diagnosis on the use of antibiotics for these pa-
tients. Overall, patients with a diagnosis of bronchitis were
prescribed antibiotics at 81% of office visits, which was
more than patients with upper respiratory tract infec-
tions and all other diagnoses combined, who were pre-
scribed antibiotics at 68% and 51% of office visits, re-
spectively. In addition, patients who were seen for an
initial visit for cough were more likely in every study year
to receive an antibiotic compared with patients with cough
who had been seen previously by the physician for this
problem (Table 3).
Finally, we considered the independent effects of
each of these predictors of antibiotic use in a multivar-
iate logistic regression analysis model. Younger pa-
tients, white patients, and patients diagnosed as having
bronchitis were significantly more likely to receive an-
tibiotics for their cough (Table 4). In addition, the in-
creased rate of antibiotic prescribing for patients seen dur-
ing an initial visit for cough compared with patients
previously seen for this problem remained significant in
the multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confi-
dence interval, 1.3-1.8). After adjusting for these clini-
cal and demographic variables, the increasing trend of
antibiotic use during the survey years remained statisti-
cally significant, although the adjusted size of the in-
crease itself was modest (odds ratio, 1.03 for antibiotic
use for each unit increase in year; 95% confidence inter-
val, 1.01-1.04). Adjustment for secondary symptoms such
as fever and sore throat had only minimal effects on the
calculated odds ratios for the factors listed in the table
(data not shown).
COMMENT
The rate of visits by adult patients with cough to pri-
mary care physicians and the rate of antibiotic use for
these patients increased from 1980 through 1994. As a
result, the absolute number of antibiotic prescriptions for
patients with cough increased by 125% from 1980 through
1994. In addition, during this period, younger patients
and white, non-Hispanic patients were more likely to re-
ceive antibiotics for cough, even after adjusting for the
clinical diagnoses listed by the physician.
A shift in the frequency of office visits by patients
with a chief complaint of cough may be multifactorial in
origin, including both actual changes in the incidence of
the underlying diseases in the population and changes
in the thresholds for patients to seek medical care for these
illnesses. In support of the former explanation, results
from the National Health Interview Surveys from 1982
and 1993 indicate that patients are reporting increasing
rates of acute respiratory conditions during this study
period.23,24
While the absolute increase in the rate of antibiotic
use during the study period is modest, the correspond-
ing absence of any evidence that antibiotic use is falling
is significant. Although there have been increasing ef-
forts to call attention to the rise in antibiotic resistance
and the role of antibiotic use in this problem, most of
these efforts have occurred only recently. Whether these
efforts at increasing awareness alone, or in conjunction

with local or nationwide programs to reduce inappro-
priate antibiotic use, will actually lead to measurable re-
ductions in antibiotic use remains to be seen. Indeed, con-
siderable barriers including patient preferences andmarket
advertising may continue to prevent significant reduc-
tions in antibiotic use.
The association of certain patient characteristics with
the increased use of antibiotics by primary care physi-
cians suggests that there may be important nonclinical
barriers to promoting more judicious use of antibiotics
for patients with cough. Alternatively, some demo-
graphic variables, such as age, may be markers for im-
portant clinical variables that more appropriately deter-
mine which patients with cough will benefit from
antibiotic therapy. In addition, patient expectations and
physician perception of those expectations may be ad-
ditional important determinants of antibiotic use,25 al-
though these factors cannot be addressed in this study.
The findings of this study are largely in agreement
with earlier reports, based on the NAMCS database, which
noted significant increases in the rate of antibiotic use
for adults with sinusitis from 1980 to 1992,18 and high
rates of antibiotic use for adult patients with upper
respiratory tract infections and bronchitis in 1992.19
Our study extends these observations to adult patients
with cough illnesses, noting an overall increase in anti-
biotic prescribing by primary care physicians through
1994. Similar high rates of antibiotic use for respiratory
illnesses also were noted in a study using a cross-
sectional sample of Kentucky Medicaid claims that in-
dicated that 60% of patients diagnosed as having com-
mon cold and 75% patients diagnosed as having acute
bronchitis subsequently filled prescriptions for antibi-
otic medications.26,27
One limitation of this study is that the rates of an-
tibiotic use are based on physician recording of new or
continuing medications at the time of the visit, not
whether the antibiotic prescriptions were ever filled or
taken by the patients. Rates of antibiotic use would be
underestimated when physicians failed to record antibi-
otic prescriptions given to patients during sampled vis-
its, while rates would be overestimated when patients
failed to fill or take antibiotic medications prescribed by
the physician. However, as noted earlier, studies using
Medicaid drug claims have noted similarly high levels of
antibiotic use for patients with acute bronchitis or a com-
mon cold.26,27
Finally, the NAMCS database does not provide the
clinical data necessary to assess the appropriateness of
each antibiotic associated with a cough visit. For ex-
ample, it is difficult to clearly identify patients with chronic
cough illnesses (particularly chronic bronchitis) who
might be appropriately treated with antibiotics. More-
over, we believe that there is still a strong need for fu-

ture studies to provide better information on the appro-
priate indications for antibiotic use for adult patients with
cough.
In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic use by primary
care physicians for adult patients with cough increased
from 1980 through 1994, a period during which there
was substantially increased detection of drug-resistant res-
piratory pathogens. As programs to decrease inappro-
priate use of antibiotics are initiated, continued moni-
toring of the rate of antibiotic use will be necessary to
detect if these efforts have been successful. In addition,
future efforts to promote judicious antibiotic use should
consider the importance of nonclinical factors in influ-
encing current patterns of antibiotic use, and design in-
terventions that address these barriers.
