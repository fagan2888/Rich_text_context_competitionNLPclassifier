Abstract
This study investigated the effects of users' familiarity with the objects depicted in icons on the
cognitive performance of icon identification. First, without knowing the specific semantic
information of icons, 20 participants were required to search for target icons among visually
similar distractors for 3-hour-long training sessions across 1 week, during which their familiarity
with different icons was manipulated by differential exposure frequencies. Half of the icons were
presented 10 times more often than the other half. Subsequently, participants' abilities to recall
corresponding semantic information when cued with associated target icons were tested after
they had learned all the icons. The results showed that, in both the visual search task and the
semantic information recall task, participants performed significantly better when the icons were
more familiar. Importantly, the effects of icon complexity in the visual search task diminished as
participants became familiar with the icons, and the beneficial effects of familiarity in the semantic
information recall task were larger when the icons were complex. These findings have practical
implications for icon design. When creating new icons for time critical user interfaces, icons should
be kept as simple as possible and employ familiar, commonly used, graphics.

Introduction
With the improvement of informationization as well as the development of human­computer
interactions, icons have become an important component of digital user interfaces
(Li, Chen, Sha, & Lu, 2017; Nakamura & Zeng-Treitler, 2012). Compared with words,
graphic symbols are able to transcend language barriers (Bocker, 1996; Caplin, 2001;

more concise and efficient way (Amer & Maris, 2007; Chi & Dewi, 2014; Ells & Dewar, 1979;
Huang, Bias, & Schnyer, 2015; Muter & Mayson, 2007; Perry, Stevens, Wiggins, & Howell,
2008). However, people are still likely to misinterpret the meanings of icons that are poorly
designed. Thus, reducing cognitive friction and improving the user experience are critical
problems in icon design.
In general, when designers create an icon, three icon characteristics need to be taken into
consideration: visual complexity, concreteness, and semantic distance (Garcia, Badre, &
Stasko, 1994; McDougall, Curry, & de Bruijin, 1999; Silvennoinen, Kujala, & Jokinen,
2017). To date, numerous studies investigated the effects of these icon characteristics on
visual search performance: people responded more quickly and more accurately to simple
icons than complex icons (McDougall, de Bruijin, & Curry, 2000), users were more efficient at
understanding concrete icons compared with abstract icons (Rogers & Oborne, 1987;
Stammers & Hoffman, 1991), and icons with close semantic distance were easier to
identify (Goonetilleke, Shih, On, & Fritsch, 2001; McDougall, Curry, & de Bruijin, 2001).
However, a few researchers noticed that performance differences between different icon types
diminished after users had gained considerable experience with the icons (Green & Barnard,
1990; Stotts, 1998). McDougall et al. (2000) conducted a series of experiments to examine the
factors considered central to icon usability. The findings indicated that performance
differences between concrete and abstract icons diminished after icon sets were used more
frequently. To further explore this issue, Isherwood, McDougall, and Curry (2007)
experimented with an icon identification task over a long series of trials to mimic the
effects of increasing user experience. Participants were required to select the target icon
(from a grid of eight icons) that they thought matched the label of semantic information.
Meanwhile, they received different feedback when they chose the correct or incorrect icons.
The results indicated that the importance of icon characteristics changed with user
experience. Previous studies have shown familiarity to be a very important factor that
has lasting effects on icon identification (e.g., Isherwood et al., 2007; McDougall et al.,
2000, 2001).
However, there are two forms of users' familiarity with icons (Isherwood et al., 2007).
The first is familiarity with the relationship between an icon and its associated semantic
information, which relates directly to its frequency of use. The second form is familiarity
with the object depicted in an icon, which refers to users' familiarity with the icon outside of
any semantic context and independent of its purpose. That is to say, although a person may
be familiar with the object depicted in an icon, he or she may not know the exact meaning of
that icon. For example, people who have never surfed the Internet or used smart phone will
be unlikely to recognize that the icons in Figure 1 refer to home page and setting. However,
we can still consider these two icons as high familiarity icons because the objects depicted in
them, a house and a gear, often appear in our daily life.
Unfortunately, previous studies seem to overlook the effects of the second form of
familiarity. Depending on the user's experiences in daily life, the familiarity with the
objects depicted in icons might also have effects on icon identification. For example, when
we see a button that we have never used before, we might understand it better and recall its
function more accurately if it includes a familiar symbol. Therefore, the present study aims to
investigate the role of users' familiarity with the objects depicted in icons during icon
identification.
Although only a few studies have explored the effects of familiarity on icon identification,
numerous researchers have conducted extensive studies in other related areas, such as picture
naming (e.g., Sirois, Kremin, & Cohen, 2006), Language learning (Groot & Keijzer, 2000),
2 i-Perception 9(3)
and word recognition (Coane, Balota, Dolan, & Jacoby, 2011; Meier, Reymermet, &
Graf, 2013; Pazzaglia, Staub, & Rotello, 2014). Nimmo and Roodenrys (2002) found that
the accuracy of immediate serial recall was better for non-word syllables that occur
more frequently. Poppenk, Ko
¨ hler, and Moscovitch (2010) revealed that regardless of
whether familiarity was experimentally manipulated or formed by prior experience, it was
easier for participants to recall familiar proverbs compared to novel ones. Almeida, Knobel,
Finkbeiner, and Caramazza (2007) employed a delayed picture-naming task to test their
hypothesis that stimuli frequency affected the processing of input stages. Nelson and
Shffrin (2013) used a novel training paradigm to familiarize participants with new
knowledge about Chinese characters and then tested participants' performance on memory
tasks. These studies demonstrated that participants' familiarity with stimuli could
significantly affect their information encoding or retrieval performance. Therefore, because
icon identification is a cognitive process that includes the encoding and retrieval of the
associations between icons and representations, we assume that users' familiarity with the
objects depicted in icons would affect their identification performance.
To explore our prediction, in the current study, we experimentally manipulated the
exposure frequency of the icons that were unknown to our participants by asking them
to perform a series of visual search tasks for similar icons. As a result, participants
should be more familiar with the high-frequency icons. Then, we employed a semantic
information recall task to investigate the effects of familiarity with the objects depicted
in icons after participants had learned all the icons. We expect that people identify
familiar icons and recall corresponding semantic information more successfully. Moreover,
in addition to familiarity, two more independent variables (icon complexity and concreteness)
were also employed in this study; we will explore whether there are interactions between
them as well.

Materials and Design
Three hundred and eighty icons were chosen from the symbols used on industrial machineries
and household goods as well as from the icons used in the systems of computers and smart
phones. Before the formal experiments, we recruited 50 volunteers to rate all the three factors
(complexity, concreteness, and familiarity) of each icon on a 5-point scale. Instructions were
similar to those adopted in previous studies (Gilhooly & Logie, 1980; McDougall et al., 1999,
2000; Snodgrass & Vanderwart, 1980). For complexity ratings, icons were to be regarded as
complex if they contained a large amount of detail or intricacy (1 ¼ definitely simple,
5 ¼ definitely complex); for concreteness ratings, icons were to be regarded as concrete if
they depicted real objects (1 ¼ definitely abstract, 5 ¼ definitely concrete); for familiarity
ratings, icons were to be regarded as familiar if they often appeared in daily life
(1 ¼ definitely unfamiliar, 5 ¼ definitely familiar). Based on the rating results, 80 icons from
four sets were used in the experiment (20 complex and abstract icons, 20 complex and
concrete icons, 20 simple and abstract icons, and 20 simple and concrete icons, see
Appendix). Subsequently, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), followed by Newman-
Keuls comparisons, were conducted to ensure the ratings differed in accordance with the
requirements of each experimental condition (McDougall et al., 2000). The results indicated
that there were significant differences between the complexity ratings of the complex group
and the simple group, F(1, 78) ¼ 734.67, p < .001, and between the concreteness ratings of the
concrete group and the abstract group, F(1, 78) ¼ 1,553.59, p < .001. However, there was no
significant difference among the familiarity ratings of icons, F(79, 3920) ¼ 1.19, p ¼ .19, or
icons groups, F(3, 76) ¼ .74, p ¼ .44. Table 1 shows the mean ratings and standard deviations
for complexity, concreteness, and familiarity in each icon set.
Subsequently, each icon was assigned a Chinese word as a piece of semantic information
which offered a relevant description of the paired icon. The assigning of semantic information
to icons was based on the agreement between five experts (icon designers). To ensure that the
icon/semantic information pairs used in our experiment were at the same level, we asked
20 volunteers to rate the semantic distance of each icon/semantic information pair (1 ¼ not
closely related, 5 ¼ very strongly related). Semantic distance is a measure of the closeness of
the relationship between the icon and what it is intended to represent (McDougall et al.,
1999). The mean value of the ratings was 3.22, and the standard deviation value was 0.52.
The result of ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference in semantic distance
among icon/semantic information pairs, F(79, 1520) ¼ 1.68, p ¼ .25.
Finally, without changing the overall shape of each icon, we modified some details (e.g.,
adding or deleting lines, enlarging or narrowing internal elements, changing filling areas, etc.)

and created four distractors for each icon (e.g., see Figure 2). By using these distractors,
participants had to encode the entire icon rather than a subset of features in the visual
search task.
Visual Search Task
Participants performed a visual search task during three sessions on three different days in a
week, and each session consisted of 440 trials (see Figure 3). A 5-minute break was given
during one experimental session. For each participant, there were 80 icons (20 complex &
abstract icons, 20 complex & concrete icons, 20 simple & abstract icons, and 20 simple &
concrete icons) in total. Taking the icon set of complex & abstract as an example, 20 icons
were randomly assigned into high- and low-frequency groups such that 10 icons were high-
frequency icons and the other 10 were low-frequency icons. As the ratio of high versus
low frequency was fixed to be 10:1, and therefore, by using these 20 icons, we had 100
high-frequency trials (that is, 10 Â 10 ¼ 100) and 10 low frequency trials (that is,
10 Â 1 ¼ 10). Same procedure was applied to the rest three groups. Altogether, we had 400
high-frequency trials (100 complex & abstract trials, 100 complex & concrete trials, 100
simple & abstract trials, and 100 simple & concrete trials) and 40 low-frequency trials
(10 complex & abstract trials, 10 complex & concrete trials, 10 simple & abstract trials,
and 10 simple & concrete trials), making total of 440 trials. Each experimental trial began
with a fixation, and participants had to press any button to continue. Participants saw a

randomly selected target icon in the center of the screen for 1 second, which was followed by
a display of four similar icons. Participants were required to respond as to whether the target
icon was present or absent. After participants pressed a button, they received auditory
feedback that indicated whether their response was correct or not. The target icon was
present in the search array in half of the trials. The trial order and whether the target icon
was present or not in each trial were randomly determined for each subject and session. The
dependent variables were accuracy and response times in reporting whether the target was
present or absent in each trial.
Semantic Information Recall Task
After we familiarized participants with 80 icons over a 3-hour-long training (the visual search task
with three sessions), with half of the icons exposed more frequently, each participant learned the
relationships between icons and semantic information one by one in random order. Subsequently,
participants' abilities to recall the semantic information were tested (see Figure 4). In the study
session, each experimental trial began with a fixation, and participants had to press any button to
continue. Participants saw a randomly selected target icon and associated semantic information for
3 seconds before the next trial appeared. The icon-semantic information pairs were same for all
participants. In the test session, a cued-recall test was given after participants had learned all the
icons and sematic information. A randomly selected icon appeared in the center of the screen for 1
second, followed by a display of the input box. Participants had to recall the semantic information
associated with the icon and enter it in the input box. There was no time limit, and participants did
not receive any auditory feedback during this task. We instructed participants to try their best to be
as accurate as possible in recalling and entering the semantic information, and we only measured
accuracy in this task.

Results
We analyzed response time (RT) by linear mixed-effects regression, and we analyzed accuracy
data via logistic mixed-effects regressions (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008; Jaeger, 2008).
For the RT analyses of the visual search task, we considered only correct trials (9.3% error).
Then, we excluded from the analyses cases with RTs greater than 3 median absolute
deviations above or below the median RT, calculated separately for each participant,
session and condition (3.4%).
Visual Search Task
Over the 3 days of training, participants performed better on the visual search task (see
Figure 5), becoming faster, ÁAIC [akaike information criterion] ¼ À1,820, LLR [log
likelihood ratio] 2(1) ¼ 1,822.312, p < .001, and more accurate, ÁAIC ¼ À270, LLR
2(1) ¼ 272.719, p < .001, in identifying whether the target icon was present or absent from
the search display. Importantly, participants identified high-frequency icons more quickly,
ÁAIC ¼ À229, LLR 2(1) ¼ 230.798, p < .001, and more accurately, ÁAIC ¼ À118, LLR
2(1) ¼ 119.593, p < .001. Participants' accuracy and response times on the visual search
task improved significantly for both frequency conditions as all the icons became more
familiar. In addition, performance was always better for the high-frequency icons.
Figure 6 shows the mean performance on visual search task trials for simple and complex
icons over 3 days of training. Participants became faster, ÁAIC ¼ À1,090, LLR 2(1) ¼

when they were searching for simple target icons. In addition, a strong interaction was
observed between the effects of icon complexity and blocks of trials on search accuracy,
ÁAIC ¼ À11, LLR 2(1) ¼ 13.032, p < .001. However, no interaction was found between
complexity and blocks of trials on response times, ÁAIC ¼ 2, LLR 2(1) ¼ 0.068, p ¼ .795.

Discussion
Visual Search Task
The key question of this study is how to experimentally simulate users' different levels of
familiarity with the objects depicted in icons. According to the familiarity encoding methods
used in related areas (Almeida et al., 2007; Nelson & Shffrin, 2013), we manipulated
participants' familiarity with icons and created familiarity differences between high-frequency
icons and low-frequency icons by controlling the exposure frequency of the icons in a visual
search task. Compared with the visual search tasks used in previous studies, the current study
employed a stricter experimental design: (a) Instead of using different target icons as

distractors, we created visually similar icons to increase the difficulty of the task. Thus, in order
to find the target, participants had to encode the entire icon, which avoided participants'
exorbitant accuracy and too-quick responses based on the difference of any obvious feature.
(b) To minimize the pre-exiting familiarity differences between icons, high- and low-frequency
icons were randomly selected for each participant. (c) Half of the icons were exposed 10 times
more often than the other half. As a result, the familiarity difference between high-frequency
and low-frequency icons should be obvious after three days of training.
Most results of the visual search task were consistent with the results of previous studies
(Isherwood et al., 2007; McDougall et al., 2000, 2001), suggesting that the visual complexity of
icons had significant effects on response times and that visual search performance improved
with user experience. However, in the current study, because icon familiarity was manipulated
by different exposure frequencies, we observed the effects of icon familiarity more clearly (see
Figure 3). Participants' visual search performance was definitely faster and more accurate when
the icons were from high-frequency groups. Here, we provide more direct evidence
demonstrating that icon familiarity significantly affects visual search performance.
Moreover, McDougall et al. (2000) only analyzed the data of response times because the
participants in their experiment made a minimal number of errors. Therefore, the effect of
icon familiarity on visual search accuracy was still unknown. To resolve this issue, as
mentioned earlier, we appropriately increased the difficulty of the visual search task. As
predicted, we obtained the data on proportion correctly, and the results indicated that
visual complexity also had a significant effect on visual search accuracy (see Figure 4).
In addition, our results showed that there was a significant interaction on the accuracy of
the visual search task. The differences in accuracy between simple and complex icons
diminished greatly as participants became familiar with the icons. The reason for this, we
contend, is that as the exposure times of the complex icons increased, participants became
more familiar with the features of each complex icon. As a result, it became less difficult for
them to identify the target icons, and the error rate declined significantly. Besides, since the
simple icons contained fewer features, search performance for simple icons was still better
than that for complex icons and tended to stabilize with time. However, there was no
interaction effect in response time of the visual search task. The differences in response
time between simple and complex icons were relatively constant throughout the training
session. It is most likely due to that the training session was not enough. The left panel of
Figure 6 shows that the increasing of accuracy after the Day 2 was very little, which appeared
a ceiling effect. However, the response time of simple icons kept decreasing after the second
session, implying the inadequacy of training (see the right panel of Figure 6). We instructed
participants to identify target icons as accurate as possible, and there was no time limit in the
experiment. Thus, the training needed to improve RT would be longer than that for accuracy.
Therefore, we would expect to see the interaction effect in response time as well if the
participants were provided sufficient training.
Finally, our results also showed that although there was no effect of icon concreteness on
visual search accuracy, people responded more quickly to concrete icons than to abstract
icons (see Figure 5). One possible explanation is that concrete icons contain more objects that
people often see in their daily lives, and it might be easier for people to identify icons that
include more familiar elements.
Semantic Information Recall Task
After numerous trials of familiarity training with icons that differed in terms of their
familiarity, the effects of icon familiarity in the semantic information recall task were
Shen et al. 11
expected to be observed more directly. Our results revealed that users' familiarity with the
objects depicted in icons indeed influenced icon identification. As predicted, participants
performed significantly better when the icons were more familiar. According to the theory
of Johnson, Paivio, and Clark (1996), the processing of semantic information recall can be
divided into three steps: (a) search for and locate the icon, then preliminarily identify the
object depicted; (b) retrieve relevant information stored in one's memory based on the results
of identification; and (c) activate the correct semantic information associated with the icon.
We contend that users' familiarity with the objects depicted in icons may influence one or
more steps in the cognitive processing described earlier.
Numerous researchers have suggested that the currently active information in an
individual's working memory will decay gradually with time, and it will become
unavailable to subsequent processing if it is not reactivated (Baddeley, Thomson, &
Buchanan, 1975; Camos, Lagner, & Barrouillet, 2009; Schweickert & Boruff, 1986). From
this point of view, Working Memory is limited by how often activation can be rehearsed and
by how quickly they decay. If reactivation can occur more frequently, it might prevent item
activation from decaying or reduce decay rate greatly. In the semantic information task, all
the relative representations were held in memory and began decaying after participants
finished encoding the relationships between icons and the semantic information. We
contend one possible explanation is that compared to more familiar icons, less familiar
icons were relatively more difficult to reactivate, then the related semantic information
decayed faster, hurting recall performance as a result. Moreover, spreading activation
might be a more likely explanation of the frequency effects on semantic recall. The theory
of spreading activation assumes that retrieval of information from declarative memory is
governed by information activations, and items with higher activations can be retrieved more
accurately and faster than items with lower activations (Anderson, 1983; Collins & Loftus,
1988). Besides, activation could also spread over a semantic network rapidly, from one item
to associative relevancy (Anderson & Pirolli, 1984; Anderson, Reder & Lebiere, 1996).
According to this theory, the high-frequency icons spread more activation than the low-
frequency icons in the visual search task. Correspondingly, the icons with higher activation
spread more activation to the associated semantic information, which resulted in better
performance in the semantic recall task. On the contrary, other researchers believe that the
representations do not decay on their own but that attempting to hold a large amount of
information actively in one's working memory results in interference, such as confusion,
competition, or feature overlap, which hinders the retrieval of information (Nairne, 1990;
Oberauer & Kliegl, 2006; Oberauer, Lewandowsky, Farrell, Jarrold, & Greaves et al., 2012;
Saito & Miyake, 2004). Within this framework, we contend that familiarity with the icons
played an important role at the learning stage. If the icons were more familiar, the
relationships between the icons and the semantic information were better encoded, and
thus the representations were stronger and less susceptible to interference. Meanwhile, if
the icons were less familiar, especially those containing more complex visual details, the
relationships between those icons and their semantic information became relatively weak,
which likely accounts for the participants' impaired recall performance.
In addition, the results also showed that icon complexity was another important factor
that influenced participants' semantic information recall performance. The explanation might
be similar to that concerning the effects of familiarity, as discussed earlier: The information of
complex icons was more difficult to reactivate and decayed faster as a result, or the
relationships between complex icons and semantic information were not encoded
successfully during the learning stage, and thus, they were more susceptible to interference.
However, it should be noted that we did not observe a significant effect of concreteness,
12 i-Perception 9(3)
which Isherwood et al. (2007) identified in their study. The reason for this, we believe, is the
difference between experimental paradigms. In the experiment of Isherwood et al. (2007),
participants were required to select the icons that they thought matched the semantic
information, but without learning the correct meaning of the icons. In contrast, in our
study, participants completed a study session before they took the semantic information
recall test.
Moreover, our results also showed that there was a significant interaction between
complexity and familiarity (see Figure 7). When the icons were simple, the recall accuracy
for both high-frequency icons and low-frequency icons was high. However, when the icons
became complex, the participants' accuracy with low-frequency icons decreased greatly, while
their accuracy with high-frequency icons could still be maintained at a high level. That is to
say, the beneficial effects of familiarity in the semantic information recall task increased when
the icons became complex. Thus, in a sense, improving icon familiarity can reduce the
performance difference caused by icon complexity. A similar phenomenon can also be
observed in Figure 8. The reason is that compared to the other three types of icons,
complex and abstract icons were most difficult for participants to identify and recall.
Implications for Design
These findings have important implications for the design of icons. (a) If visual search activity
is the key task of the digital interface, and the operator's response time seriously affects the
quality of the entire mission, for example, in aircraft operations, nuclear power control, and
weapons operation, then reducing icon complexity should be a top priority. The reason is
that the effect of icon complexity on reaction time does not diminish as users receive extra
training. Thus, in this case, designers should reduce the amount of details in icons to lessen
the visual complexity. (b) If the task is not time-critical and the context in which the digital
interface used is relatively relaxed, the designer may increase the level of details in icons to
make the whole interface more attractive to users. Although the improvement of icon
complexity might influence the identification of the icons at the beginning, that effect will
quickly diminish as a result of user experience. (c) Designers should not merely consider the
user's familiarity with the relationship between an icon and its meaning; the effect of the
icon's familiarity should also be taken into consideration when designers create new icons.
Icons containing more familiar symbols are easier to remember and identify. Thus, unless the
design of a new icon is very simple, in most cases, it is better for designers to use common
graphics to create new icons.
Conclusions
Users' familiarity with icons takes two forms: familiarity with the relationships between icons
and semantic information, and familiarity with the objects depicted in icons. Although
numerous studies have demonstrated that the former is one of the primary determinants of
icon identification, it is still not known whether the latter affects the cognitive process. In this
article, we investigated the effects of users' familiarity with the objects depicted in icons on the
cognitive performance of icon identification. The results showed that, in both visual search
task and the semantic information recall task, participants performed worse when the objects
depicted in icons were less familiar. Importantly, the detrimental effects of low familiarity on
recall performance increased as the complexity of icon increased. These findings extend our
understanding of how familiarity affects icon identification. However, this study is limited in
several aspects. (a) Due to the limitation of experimental equipment, we only analyzed the
Shen et al. 13
accuracy data of the semantic information recall task. More data such as eye movement data
and electroencephalograms (EEGs) can be collected to provide more convincing evidence. (b)
Participants in this study are all college students who have rich experience of using human-
computer interfaces. However, the user groups should be diverse in reality, including
children, elder, etc. In the future, we will employ more advanced experimental equipment
and expand our study to more participants and more participant diversity.
