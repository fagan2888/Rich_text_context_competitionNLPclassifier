Study objective: To examine whether young, especially low socioeconomic status (SES), females are
influenced by tobacco control policies in terms of smoking initiation and transition to more adverse stages
of smoking behaviour from adolescence to young adulthood.
Design and setting: Data from 2697 young female respondents to the national longitudinal study of
adolescent health wave 1 (1994­1995) and wave 3 (2001­2002).
Measurements: The following factors were used to predict the likelihood of smoking initiation and
transition to heavier tobacco use between adolescence and young adulthood among females of low,
middle, and high SES groups: state level tobacco control policy scores, developed by the US National
Cancer Institute, state cigarette excise tax, smoking rate at school, cigarette availability at home, and
number of best friends smoking.
Main results: Stronger state level tobacco policies were associated with lower likelihood of smoking
initiation and adverse transition among low SES women, although the effect sizes were small. Adolescents
who attended schools with higher student smoking rates; adolescents who had easier access to cigarettes
at home; and adolescents who had more friends smoking were all more likely to be adverse transitioners
by young adulthood.
Conclusions: State level tobacco control policies and individual level factors during adolescence are
independently associated with smoking initiation and adverse transition by the onset of young adulthood,
especially for low SES females. While states may have very little direct influence on individual level
behaviours, through their policies they do have the potential to exert considerable influence on smoking
behaviour that persists through adolescence into young adulthood.
Cigarette smoking in the USA and other developed
countries has been found to be associated with social
class.1 2 Adult smoking is highly concentrated among
those of lower socioeconomic status (SES), where SES is
defined by educational attainment, income, and occupation.
Consequently, those of low SES bear the heaviest health
burden. To reduce such disparities, recent national initiatives
like those of the Healthy People 2010 objectives have been
undertaken, and various tobacco control policies have been
enacted and implemented.3 Many of the policy initiatives are
targeted at teenagers because most adult smokers start
smoking before age 18.4 Even in those younger than 18,
smoking initiation is known to be positively correlated with
low household income.4­6 What is not well understood is how
tobacco control policies affect smoking in young female
adolescents, particularly those of low SES. The goal of this
paper is an exploration of how tobacco control policies
differentially influence female adolescents in low, middle,
and high SES groups in terms of their smoking initiation and
transition to a more detrimental or adverse (that is, heavier
tobacco use) stage of smoking behaviour during the period
from adolescence through young adulthood.
Early tobacco control research chiefly focused on the bio-
behavioural influences of smoking such as personality traits,
family characteristics, and parental smoking status in an
attempt to identify the characteristics of children and
adolescents who were at risk of smoking. Consequent tobacco
control interventions, such as school based educational
programmes, were based upon this bio-behavioural
demand-side model. More recently, tobacco control research
has shifted to a focus on the environmental factors
influencing tobacco use (for example, policies to reduce
supply, raise tobacco taxes, and limit tobacco advertising and
promotion). However, neither the bio-behavioural influences
models nor the environmental influences models alone
adequately explain why adolescents take up smoking or
why they continue to smoke. Instead, models combining both
of these two sources of influences--macro, distal environ-
mental factors (for example, state and school related factors)
and proximal factors (for example, individual, parent, family,
and peer related factors)--offer an opportunity to examine
how individual smoking behaviour is influenced by an
interaction of multiple factors. Considering the interaction
of these multiple factors is important because it is now
recognised that although tobacco control policies do influ-
ence rates of adolescent smoking initiation and transition to
heavier smoking, not all adolescents respond to policies in
the same way. Indeed, a person's susceptibility or resilience
towards smoking is mainly determined by demographic and
proximal factors, which may be modified by the more distal
policy environment, such as clean indoor air laws.7­9
In this paper we investigate the issue of whether state level
tobacco control policies have an effect on smoking transitions
from adolescence through young adulthood. Stated another
way, do differences exist in the smoking behaviour of
adolescents of low SES living in states with strong youth
tobacco access policies compared with states with weak
policies? Available evidence is sometimes contradictory. Most
adolescents believe that cigarettes are readily available,10­13
and there is evidence to support that notion. In one study,
83% of those adolescents who ever smoked reported that they
did not usually buy their own cigarettes, and adolescents
ii13

whose best friends smoked were significantly more likely to
report getting cigarettes from other smokers.14 Likewise,
experimental smokers were more likely to rely on friends,
peers, or family members for cigarettes.15 However, as they
move to higher use rates adolescents must purchase
cigarettes themselves,10 11 thus smoking transition and
commercial cigarette accessibility are linked.
Even though policies limiting youth access have been
adopted at the local, state, and federal levels, debate over the
effectiveness of youth access laws has not been silenced,
partly because of a paucity of data on enforcement and partly
because of methodological limitations of studies examining
policy effectiveness.16­23 Regardless of the debate, policy
enforcement seems to be an essential element in reducing
sales to minors.24 25 With the Synar Amendment (July 1992),
federal block grants are conditional upon each state enacting
and enforcing laws restricting the sale and distribution of
tobacco products to minors. However, implementation of the
laws has been slow: since 1996 each state has been required
to conduct annual surveys of merchant compliance, but
states failing to meet the requirements of the Synar
Amendment have not been punished. This is the case even
though several studies examining the impact of access laws
concluded that enforcement and merchant compliance lead
to reduced access to tobacco products and consequent
reductions in adolescent smoking.16 21­23 One experimental
study in Illinois showed that active enforcement over a two
year period resulted in not just a reduction of sales to minors,
but a reduction in tobacco use by adolescents.22 These studies
showing a positive relation between increased policy com-
pliance and reductions in adolescent smoking are encoura-
ging, but it should be understood that even if youth access
law compliance by merchants were 100%, adolescent smok-
ing would not completely disappear. Adolescents will still
procure cigarettes from other sources, such as friends or
family. Indeed, any level of merchant compliance less than
100% guarantees that some adolescents will find a store
willing to sell them cigarettes.26 Therefore, the effects of
access laws are just one factor in adolescent smoking, albeit
an important one.
The fundamental hypothesis of this study is that restricting
commercial availability of tobacco to minors will make it
more difficult for adolescents to obtain tobacco products,
thereby delaying their smoking initiation. While the focus of
the study is on the effects of state level tobacco control
policies, we also consider multiple factors important in
determining smoking transitions in the long run. Hence
tobacco control related factors at school and individual levels
during adolescence are examined together, along with state
level tobacco control factors. In considering the long term
influence of adolescent experiences, we hypothesise that the
impact of tobacco control policies targeted at youths will
extend into young adulthood, and that family and school
experiences will have a sustained influence on smoking over
the long term. In examining the effects of state tobacco
control policies described above, we incorporate into our
model measures of cigarette availability at home; number of
best friends who smoked; and student smoking rates at
school, while controlling for the effects of age; race and
ethnicity; parent structure; and family bonding.
METHODS
Our dataset, the national longitudinal study of adolescent
health (Add Health), is a school based survey of the health
related behaviours of adolescents. Add Health ensures
national representativeness by surveying individual adoles-
cents from 132 schools, grades 7 to 12, using a sampling
frame stratified by region, level of urbanisation, school type,
school size, and by school racial compositions. In 1994­5
(wave 1), data from 18 924 adolescents were collected; in
1996 (wave 2) and in 2001­2 (wave 3), follow up in-home
surveys were conducted to interview again 15 197 of the
respondents from wave 1 about their health behaviours and
life experience as young adults. Data from wave 1 were used
to operationalise outcome variables on smoking, demo-
graphic characteristics, family characteristics, parent's level
of education, and family income (the latter two from the
parent's questionnaire). A set of linked identifiers--data
from the in-school survey, in-home wave 1 and wave 3
surveys, school administrator survey, and parent surveys,
along with state tobacco control score data (described
below)--were merged with detailed information about
female respondents' behaviours related to smoking, as well
as the characteristics of their families and friends, and their
school and state. For analyses, the sample was restricted to
adolescents younger than 18 years of age at wave 1, namely
those who could not legally purchase cigarettes, resulting in
2697 female cases from 33 states and 126 schools.
Female respondents were classified into five groups based
on a hierarchy of increasing severity of smoking related
behaviours.27 28 Respondents who had: (1) never puffed a
cigarette, classified as never smokers (the reference group in
our multivariate analyses); (2) smoked an entire cigarette at
least once but not every day in the past 30 days, classified as
intermittent smokers; (3) smoked every day, classified as
regular smokers; (4) smoked an entire cigarette at least once,
but not in the past 30 days, and who claimed not to ever have
been regular smokers, classified as experimental smokers; (5)
formerly been a regular smoker and who had quit, classified
as former smokers. To create subgroups for analyses, the
classification of smoking stages was applied to female
respondents who answered wave 1 Add Health in-home

questionnaire in 1995 and who participated in the follow up
wave 3 study in 2001­2. Data from the two time points, seven
years apart*, permit inferences to be made about transitions
in smoking behaviour. Different kinds of smoking transition
might have occurred during the seven year time period, but
the focus of this paper is on adverse transition (that is, a
transition from one smoking classification stage in wave 1 to
a more adverse stage in wave 3). An important subgroup of
adverse transitioners is ``initiators''--those who had never
smoked in wave 1 but became a smoker in any stage in wave
3. In our analyses we compare: (1) initiators and never
smokers; and (2) adverse transitioners and never smokers.
Table 1 reports the definitions and sample sizes for smoking
initiators and adverse transitioners.
For analyses, female respondents were classified into three
groups, low SES, middle SES, and high SES based on both
family income and parent education in wave 1. Missing
values for family income were imputed.29 Based on the
federal poverty level guidelines, four levels of family income
were created: (1) below poverty level (,100% of poverty
level); (2) low income (100%­199%); (3) middle income
(200%­399%); and (4) high income (>400%). Missing values
for parent education were not imputed. Parent education
level was combined with family income level to create SES
groups; if the income level was below poverty level, then
cases with missing values in parent education were classified
as low SES. The three SES groups were constructed as
follows: (1) low SES includes (a) cases from families below
poverty level and all levels of parent education, and (b) cases
from parent education less than high school graduate; (2)
middle SES includes cases from (a) low income families/
parent education of high school or more, (b) middle income
families/parent education of high school or some college, and
(c) high income families/parent education less than or high
school graduate; (3) high SES includes cases from (a) high
income level/parent education of some college or more, and
(b) middle income/parent education of college graduate.
Sample sizes were 1245 for low SES, 812 for middle SES, and
640 for high SES female adolescents.
For state level tobacco control policy variables, we adopted
a measure of comprehensive state tobacco control efforts
based on a score developed by the National Cancer Institute
evaluating nine items for each state each year (see Alciati et al
for further information about the rating system).30 31 Three of
the items cover law enforcement provisions (statewide
enforcement, random inspections, graduated penalties); six
cover specific tobacco control provisions (photo identifica-
tion, free distribution, minimum age, packaging, vending
machines, and clerk intervention). We also incorporated 1995
state excise tax data as a tobacco policy variable in separate
models. For school level control measures (for example,
penalties for smoking at school), we focused on the smoking
rates of students in the schools attended by our respondents,
selected from preliminary analyses. At the individual level,
cigarette availability at home; extent of best friends'
smoking; and family bonding were used. Control variables
were age, race/ethnicity, and parent structure. Small sample
sizes for Asian, Native American, and other race groups
precluded analyses of these detailed categories of race/
ethnicity. Instead, three racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic,
African American, and white and other racial groups (here-
after referred to as white group) were created.
To account for the nested structure of individual level data
within states and schools, multilevel logistic regressions
comparing initiators to never smokers were used. Low,
middle, and high SES female adolescents were initially
modelled separately to examine the possible overall effects of

State level tobacco control policies
Statewide enforcement Establishes a clearly designated statewide enforcement authority for sales.
Random inspections Establishes random, unannounced inspections of retailers as part of the enforcement
mechanism, using underage buyers for the purpose of identifying violators, and does not
prohibit other use of minors to test compliance.
Graduated penalties Establishes a system of graduated penalties or fines applicable to all youth access laws, to be
levied within three years, plus possibility of suspension or revocation of a required tobacco
retail licence for repeated sales to minors.
Photo identification Requires merchants to request photographic identification for customers who appear to be
under 21 years of age.
Free distribution Total ban on distribution of free tobacco samples, coupons for free samples, or rebates.
Minimum age Prohibits the sale or distribution of any tobacco products to persons less than 18 years of age
through any sales or distribution outlet, and a warning sign is required at point of purchase
with specific penalty for failing to post a sign.
Packaging Prohibits all cigarette sales other than in a sealed package conforming to federal labelling
requirements.
Vending machines Total ban on sale of all tobacco products through vending machines in all locations.
Clerk intervention Prohibits access to or purchase of tobacco products without the intervention of a sales clerk.

tobacco control policies in general. Later, a series of models
incorporating individual policy items, one at a time, was
developed to evaluate the effect of each individual policy.
School level characteristics and individual level character-
istics were included in the models, along with basic
demographic characteristics as controls. The analyses were
repeated for adverse transitioners compared with never
smokers to assess policy effects on the three SES groups.
RESULTS
Table 3 reports the descriptive statistics of predictors at the
individual level by low, middle, and high SES females for
never smoked and initiation groups, as well as for never
smoked and adverse transition groups.
Table 4 reports the odds ratios of smoking initiation and
adverse transition for low, middle and high SES female
groups. Our hypothesis that state level tobacco control
policies reduce the likelihood of smoking initiation and
adverse transition was supported. Stronger state tobacco
control policies are in general positively associated with a
lower likelihood of initiation and adverse transition. The
positive policy effects for initiation were strongest for low
SES females, whose odds ratio was 0.95 (0.98 for middle SES,
1.00 for high SES). For initiation, school level smoking rates
did not vary substantially across low, middle, and high SES
groups (OR = 1.01, 0.99 and 1.00, respectively), a finding
consistent with the research of others.32
The pattern of results for adverse transition was overall
very similar to that of initiation, and consistent with prior
research by others. Individual level tobacco control variables,
such as cigarette availability at home and best friends'
smoking, were significantly associated with the likelihood of
adverse transition (typically estimates did not reach statis-
tical significance for initiation). Availability of cigarettes at
home was associated with greater odds of initiation and
adverse transition in all SES groups. If there were best friends
who smoked, the odds of initiation and adverse transition
increased (significantly so for transition, less significantly for
initiation). Of note, there was a consistent pattern of having
one, two, or three best friends smoking associated with
initiation and adverse transition, but it was not the linear
relation seen for other variables, such as state policy effects,
wherein greater effects for the low SES group were seen.
Instead we see that the more pronounced effects are on the

middle SES group (for example, with two best friends
smoking, the transition odds ratios for low, middle, and high
SES female groups are, respectively, 2.95, 7.61, and 4.75).
However, for low SES females, having more best friends
smoking translates into a higher likelihood of adverse
transition (OR increasing from 1.59 to 2.67).
We also evaluated the effects of eight of the individual
policiesÀ in separate models for enforcement related policies:
(1) statewide enforcement, (2) random inspections, and (3)
graduated penalties, and access related policies, (4) photo
identification, (5) free distribution, (6) minimum age, (7)
packaging, and (8) vending machines. With respect to
smoking initiation, we found that two of the three enforce-
ment related policy variables (statewide enforcement and
random inspections) and one of the five access related policy
variables (photo identification) represent the most significant
effects of the policies. But almost every control policy had the
same pattern: higher levels of controls lead to lower
likelihoods of initiation for lower SES females. In other
words, tobacco control policies have the biggest impact on
reducing the likelihood of smoking initiation in low SES
females, less of an impact on the likelihood of middle SES
female group, and the least impact on high SES females.
Indeed, for initiation there were almost no positive effects
noted for any control policy on those female adolescents in
the high SES group, a pattern that was even more
pronounced for the adverse transition analyses results. This
point will be discussed in a later section of the paper. To
illustrate the positive effects of specific control policies, we
focus on three of them. Firstly, for statewide enforcement,
the odds ratios of initiation were significantly lower for the
low (0.89) and middle (0.91) SES female groups; on the other
hand, the policy had no effect on the high SES female group
(OR = 1.00). Secondly, for random inspections the odds
ratios of initiation were significantly lower for low (0.88)
and middle (0.90) SES female groups. Finally, photo
identification had a significant positive effect on the low
SES female group (OR = 0.85), but not on the middle SES
female group (OR = 0.95, NS) and on high SES females
(OR = 1.10, NS). However, other policies had a pattern
similar to the significant ones (that is, tobacco control
policies have the biggest impact as SES decreases), one
example of which is free distribution, where the odds ratios
were 0.81, 0.95 and 0.99 respectively for low, middle, and
high SES.
The results for the analyses of adverse smoking transition
(as defined in the Method section) were virtually identical in
pattern. They can be summarised as follows: stronger tobacco
control policies are positively related to lower likelihood of
adverse transition in smoking, especially for the low SES
female group. Although most of the estimates did not reach

Cigarette smoking transition in females of low socioeconomic status ii17

conventional levels of statistical significance, the magnitude
and the direction of the policy effects were none the less
encouraging, especially for the low SES female group.`
In summary, stronger state tobacco control policies are
associated with lower likelihood of smoking initiation and
adverse transition. These policies had a larger impact on low
SES than on middle and high SES female groups. Individual
level tobacco control factors, such as the availability of
cigarettes at home and best friends' smoking, were powerful
predictors of adverse transition as well. Given the minimal
level of tobacco control policies across states at the time data
were collected (before the Synar Amendment was fully
implemented), the results clearly show an encouraging
association between stronger policies and lower likelihood.
Therefore, if states increase their effort levels, we can
reasonably expect to see positive effects in reducing adverse
transition.
DISCUSSION
Because stronger state tobacco control policies are especially
associated with lower likelihood of smoking initiation and
adverse transition in low and middle SES female groups,
policies related to enforcement provisions have the potential
to decrease adverse transition--if properly implemented.
Results for the low SES female group are especially
noteworthy: stronger policies are associated with lower
likelihood of adverse transition for both low and middle
SES female groups, but not necessarily for the high SES
female group. Somewhat surprisingly, there were no positive
effects for high SES females. Indeed, they sometimes had the
opposite sign, although none of estimates were statistically
significant. A possible explanation for the lack of policy effect
may be that high SES females have access to other sources of
cigarettes. The small effect sizes generally seen even for low
SES females should be viewed in light of the fact that levels
of state tobacco control efforts reported in the data are far
from target levels. Further studies that track the effectiveness
of state level policies should be undertaken regularly as
tobacco control efforts ramp up toward their target levels.
It is also important to bear in mind that the tobacco control
polices included in this analysis measure just the existence of
a policy, not its implementation or the actual enforcement of
laws. Two states might have identical laws, but enforce them
quite differently. Or laws may be implemented selectively. As
an example, consider that previous studies show girls have an
easier time purchasing tobacco products from stores than
boys; in fact, clerks more frequently encourage girls to buy
cigarettes, and request identification less frequently from
them than boys.33­35 Race and ethnicity of clerks also
influence tobacco sales to minors--African American clerks
are less likely to sell to minors.35 What this suggests is that
the proper implementation and rigourous enforcement of
photo identification and clerk intervention policies, both
involving an active interaction between merchants and
buyers, could be quite effective in deterring access to tobacco
products, especially for initiators. Indeed, photo identification
was strongly associated with lower likelihood of initiation
and adverse transition among low SES females. The reason
that photo identification was not associated with middle and
high SES female groups is unclear. It might be because
middle and high SES female groups are more likely to obtain
cigarettes from social sources instead of stores, or might it be
because stores in middle or high SES females' neighbour-
hoods do not check photo identification to the same extent as
stores in low SES neighbourhoods. If laws are enforced
selectively and if low SES is correlated with geographical
locality, then the differential effects we see for state policies
may be attributable less to the actual state policy and more to
its enforcement. The question of clerk intervention effective-
ness is yet to be determined, as no state received a positive
score in 1995. It may be that clerk intervention could be an
effective policy, but difficult to implement. Future research
regarding this should determine the answer.
A further consideration of study limitations is that of the
seven year gap of the Add Health data used for the analyses
of predicting the association of tobacco control polices
between adolescence and young adulthood--a long time
span for adolescents experiencing numerous transformative
events in their life (becoming independent, moving away
from home, starting college, starting jobs, and so on). Many
factors, some possibly important, in determining smoking
behaviour are therefore missing from the two waves of the
Add Health data. A related issue is the timing of the
collection of the data we used. In 1992, when enactments
of the Synar Amendment were gradually being implemented,
the average compliance rate for 93 US cities was 23%.36 By
2001 the average of all state compliance rates was 83% and
nine states reported compliance rates above 90%.21 In our
analyses, we were limited to available data, but data collected
in the future may show a different pattern. We also
intentionally focused our attention on low SES and other
SES female groups, and so did not examine similarities or
differences of gender in the data. As the data already exist, it
would be worthwhile analysing smoking and SES for men to
see if additional insights on the effectiveness of policy might
not be gleaned. Finally, the data were not experimental, so
caution is needed when interpreting the findings, especially
for causality.
What is not in question is that factors at the individual
level are all important predictors for adverse transition. Girls
who have easy access to cigarettes at home, and girls who
have more friends smoking, are all more likely to be adverse
transitioners. An especially strong association was noted
between the number of best friends smoking during the teen
` No significant interaction effects between race/ethnicity indicators and
state tobacco control policies were obtained. Therefore, only the main
effects were reported and discussed in the paper.
What this paper adds
Past studies of the effects of tobacco control polices and
factors on general population have been conducted, but few
studies have investigated the impact of tobacco control
policies and factors on the subpopulation of the low
socioeconomic status female group. In this study, although
the effect sizes are small, stronger state level tobacco control
policies are associated with lower likelihood of smoking
initiation and adverse transition, especially for low SES
females.
Policy implications
While individual level factors (such as friends and family)
have a profound impact on smoking, state level policies, such
as tobacco access laws, have a substantial positive impact on
smoking for the low SES female group. Although states may
have very little direct influence on individual level behaviours,
through their policies they do have the potential to exert
considerable influence on smoking behaviour, which persists
through adolescence into young adulthood. For the low SES
female group in particular, the greatest promise of deterring
them from smoking in later life may well lie in the policies
implemented during their adolescence.

years for all SES women and their adverse transition to
smoking, possibly because having more smoking friends
means more sources of tobacco. School level predictors, in
general, were not important predictors. Student smoking
rates at school were only marginally associated with the odds
of adverse transition in smoking, which is consistent with the
findings of most previous research that school interventions
are not effective in lowering smoking rates in the long run.32
In conclusion, state level tobacco control policies and
individual level factors during adolescence are independently
associated with smoking initiation and adverse transition by
the onset of young adulthood, especially for the low female
SES group. While states may have very little direct influence
on individual level behaviours, through their policies they do
have the potential to exert considerable influence on smoking
behaviour that persists through adolescence into young
adulthood. For the low SES female group in particular, the
greatest promise of deterring them from smoking in later
life may well lie in policies implemented during their
adolescence.
