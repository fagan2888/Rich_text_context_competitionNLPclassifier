modelling: Eating
as an aesthetic and
moral practice

Abstract
This paper investigates the relation between food, the body and morality in fashion
modelling. More than has been recognized so far, eating is a continuous form of body
work that is decidedly essential to aesthetic labour. Against the backdrop of slender
aesthetics, models are purposefully socialized into remaining or becoming slender,
through food beliefs inducing them to eat in specific ways. Food is classified into
good and bad categories, and believed to affect male and female bodies differently.
But other than to aesthetics or gender, considering `what (not) to eat' links to morality,
enabling models to draw symbolic boundaries between themselves and others. These
show two main moral imperatives: models should eat controlled and effortlessly. Solving
this moral paradox, models normalize and conceal controlled eating. Ultimately, the
fashion modelling food system preoccupies models with self-surveillance and reinforces
power inequalities between models and other professionals.

On an evening in a bar in downtown Brussels, I have drinks with Nahima, a
32-year-old French-Moroccan ex-model. From the age of 14 she has been a
high-end `ethnic' model working mainly in Paris and Milan. Retired from the
industry for four years now, she currently works in Brussels as a social volunteer.
She looks back on her time in modelling as a joyful and exciting period: `fashion
was an environment where I felt completely in the right place. Modelling was like

a second nature to me. And luckily', she says, `I managed to keep both my feet
firmly on the ground'. She reminisces about the amazing parties and the beautiful,
pleasant people she encountered. Recalling the glamour and excitement of those
times, a radiant, almost euphoric expression appears on her face.
Nahima tells me all about the sexy, low-cut dresses and the high heels she used
to wear during photo-shoots. I ask her whether she had to make any particular
effort in order to fit into those outfits. She replies: `no, look at me now!' ­ Nahima
has a slender body, and a particularly narrow face, with prominent cheekbones ­
`and now, I even gained weight! No, all that just went by itself'. At some point
during our conversation I feel like having a drink. I decide on a glass of beer and
I offer to get one for Nahima as well, at which point she looks disgusted, and even
quite shocked by my proposal. She answers with a firm, decisive `no'. In response
to my probably puzzled facial expression (surprised that offering someone a drink
could elicit such an indignant reaction) she explains that her aversion to beer is a
remainder from her modelling period. `The problem with beer', she says, `is not just
the amount of calories it contains, but that it stimulates the body's production of
female hormones, oestrogen'. She tells me that oestrogen stimulates the body to
produce fat and slows down the generation of muscles. Hence, beer makes the body
particularly plump. Nahima prefers to drink wine, which contains around the same
amount of calories as beer, a bit over a hundred per glass she tells me, but does not
have negative hormonal effects on her body.
Nahima then continues to lay out her nutritional habits to me, emphasizing that
she never followed a diet, but has always eaten quite normally. Her extensive
explanation of her eating and drinking habits, however, indicates something else:
I eat no carbohydrates, not at all back then and now very rarely. I used to eat a lot of
grated carrots, because they put that in just about everything they served me at
work . . . And meat, only that very white part of a chicken. But no lamb, absolutely
no lamb! Very fat. No pig, but that's also because I'm a Muslim. And no beef. Maybe,
yes, sometimes I eat goat, a little piece. And fish, grilled fish.
Speaking about oil, she starts looking troubled, saying she uses only a little bit of
olive oil for frying something, but prefers to avoid it. To get enough sugar she eats
a piece of fruit every now and then. Only the sugars coming from fruits are good
sugars, but having too much of them is bad. This is why fruit juices are a no-go for
Nahima: `the amount of fruits that go into one juice, plus all the added sugars,
makes that really way too many'.
In the detailed account of her eating habits, Nahima excludes a range of food-
stuffs from her habitual regimen by constructing categories of allowed, good foods
and forbidden, bad foods (cf. Furst et al., 2000). These categories are based on
various (presumed) characteristics, such as caloric value, sugar level, amount of fat,
carbohydrates, and hormonal effect. In addition, she takes into account religious
prohibitions regarding pork. Nahima's classifications lay bare rules and beliefs
regarding food salient to fashion modelling ­ a field particularly preoccupied

with slender models (Mears, 2011; Neff et al., 2005; Wissinger, 2015: 108­9). This
standard of thinness is (increasingly) extreme and, for many models, not readily
achievable (Reaves et al., 2004; Van der Laan, 2015; Wissinger, 2015). Against the
backdrop of slender corporeal aesthetics, beginning young models are purposefully
socialized, often by modelling agents, into remaining or becoming slender, through
food rules and beliefs inducing them to eat in specific ways.
Based on ethnographic data obtained in Amsterdam, Paris and Warsaw, I inves-
tigate the relation between food, the body and morality in the aesthetic labour of
fashion models. I present fashion modelling as an insightful case for understanding
how food and eating practices are relevant and often challenging to the work of
aesthetic labourers, and ask: how, and to what ends, do professional fields embed
food rules and beliefs that structure (as well as challenge) the aesthetic labour of the
workers they inhabit?
This paper is inspired by Mary Douglas' work on food categorizations (1972,
2003). It identifies which food categories are relevant in this field by looking at how
fashion professionals classify food (cf. Douglas, 1972: 62; Furst et al., 2000). While
classifications of food are often embedded in rational, scientific frames, they are not
merely based on facts. They rather provide a guide for individuals to assess their
eating habits in terms of what is good (Coveney, 2001: viii). Because the know-
ledges upon which food is categorized are normative, and at times arbitrary, I study
food in fashion modelling anthropologically, as a categorical belief system
(cf. Douglas, 1972, 2003; Le
´ vi-Strauss, 1997).
The consideration of `what (not) to eat' is both an aesthetic and ethical one, and
in addition, it is a gendered concern. First, eating is a form of body work that is
carried out with the motivation to aesthetically shape, or alter, the model's body
(Gimlin, 2007; Tyler and Abbott, 1998). The majority of fashion professionals
bestow food with specific properties that are believed to affect models' physiques.
Different foods and eating techniques are classified as more or less obstructive to
successfully embodying the standard of slenderness. At the same time, eating is
linked to various moral rules, which enable fashion models to draw boundaries and
morally position themselves vis-a
` -vis others (Coveney, 2001; cf. Holla, 2016;
Lamont, 1992). And finally, food is believed to have different effects on male
and female model-bodies. Caloric foods, in particular carbohydrates, are framed
as dangerous for female model bodies, and needing to be controlled in different
ways and by various degrees (cf. Douglas, 2003).
Categorizations of good, bad, healthy or dangerous foods, produced in the
fashion modelling food system, stimulate controlled eating. Simultaneously, a per-
sistent norm of effortlessness requires concealment of such control (Tyler and
Abbott, 1998: 434­5). This paradox of moral imperatives renders models preoccu-
pied with self-surveillance and self-objectification, and subjugated by agencies and
clients (cf. Mears, 2008). It also renders eating a sober, solitary, hardly enjoyable
practice for models.
Finally, the fashion modelling food system is significant for how people increas-
ingly `aestheticize' and moralize the body, its size and the practice of eating
Holla 3
accordingly (Featherstone, 1991; Mennell, 1996; Shilling, 2012). Dietary rules in
fashion modelling reflect, in a magnified way, how food is categorized and dealt
with in contemporary western societies that are increasingly obsessed with food in
relation to slender bodies (Mennell, 1996; Shilling, 2012).
Moralizing looks, size and food
Within the contemporary western framework of bodily aesthetics, slenderness is an
increasingly prominent beauty standard (Bordo, 2004; Featherstone, 1991;
Mennell, 1996; Shilling, 2012; Van der Laan, 2015; Wissinger, 2015). The
demand of being slim places minding what you eat central to people's body
work (cf. Tyler and Abbot, 1998; Gimlin, 2007). For aesthetic labourers, who
work in industries revolving around appearance, being slender is a job requirement
their salaries depend on (Warhurst and Nickson, 2001; Witz et al. 2003). However,
also for people outside aesthetic industries slenderness has become something to
aspire: not in the last place, because it comes with social and economic benefits
(Hamermesh, 2011; Vandebroeck, 2016).
Slenderness is associated with a whole range of positive traits: advertising, fash-
ion and mainstream media project the belief that thinness connotes control, power,
wealth, competence, and success (Counihan, 1999: 9, O'Neil and Silver 2017: 117).
Slender persons, then, are perceived to `house a self that errs on the side of moral
superiority' (Paxson, 2005: 20). Such positive perceptions, in turn, create a `halo-
effect': a self-fulfilling prophecy of being granted those opportunities (in work,
friendship, love) through which people actually become more successful (Kaplan,
1978; Hamermesh, 2011). In other words: slenderness produces privileged
positions.
Vis-a
` -vis the appraisal of slender bodies there is an intensified condemnation of
fat bodies ­ on aesthetic, but on moral grounds too: `fat individuals are considered
personally responsible for their weight, lazy, lacking in self-control, and incompe-
tent' (Gruys, 2012: 484, cf. O'Neill and Silver, 2017: 121). Their body-size is read
`as an indication of moral sloppiness' (Paxson, 2005: 17). This condemnation of fat
bodies gives ground to a persistent fat stigma that leads to workplace discrimin-
ation and social exclusion of the obese (Kwan and Trautner, 2011; O'Brien et al.,
2013).
The moralization of body size turns food and the eating body into a moral
matter accordingly (Coveney, 2001; Wacquant, 1998: 346). In western societies
especially, there has been a surge of foodie blogging (Johnston and Baumann,
2010) and food activism (Siniscalchi and Counihan, 2014), giving rise to a prolif-
eration of food discourses that separate right from wrong foodstuffs and ways of
eating them. Food consumption is increasingly used by people to morally position
themselves as good eaters in relation to others who they depict as bad eaters
(Johnston et al., 2011: 312). This makes food a very personal thing, touching
upon people's sense of self. Belasco and Scranton write that `if we are what we
eat, we are also what we don't eat . . . To eat is to distinguish and discriminate,
4 Ethnography 0(00)
include and exclude. Food choices establish boundaries and borders' (2014: 2). The
food system in fashion modelling is a case in point to get a closer look into the way
symbolic boundaries between self and others are drawn.
Bringing food studies to aesthetic labour studies
Food and eating practices are relevant to aesthetic labourers across a myriad of
professions and fields, but mostly to those that involve display work (Mears and
Connell, 2016). For ballet dancers, exotic dancers, but also for shopfloor workers
in clothing retail, the control of food-intake is an important aesthetic practice that
structures their labour (Thomas, 1993; Turner and Wainwright, 2003; Aalten, 2007;
Janz, 2013; Craig, 2013). However, while the importance of food is a well-
researched fact in studies of dance or professional athleticism (Wacquant, 1992;
Thomas, 1993; Turner and Wainwright, 2003; Aalten, 2007; Ono et al., 2012), the
apparent centrality of (not) eating in the field of fashion modelling is largely dis-
regarded. Especially viewing the abundant attention popular media and fashion
industries pay to (disordered) eating practices of fashion models,11 surprisingly few
scholars have placed fashion models' eating practices central to their investigations
(cf. Entwistle, 2002; Entwistle and Wissinger, 2006; Mears, 2011; Neff et al., 2005;
Soley-Beltran, 2006; Wissinger, 2015). An exception is Czerniawski (2015), who
looks at the backstage of aesthetic labour and pays attention to eating practices of
plus-size female fashion models. Interestingly, she argues that plus-size models
engage in forms of bodily discipline that rely on wider, societally shared `thin
aesthetics' (2015: 23).
This paper empirically investigates the role of food and eating in the field of
fashion modelling. In doing so, I draw on the concept of `body work', notably
elaborated by Debra Gimlin. Body work particularly covers the load of what
fashion models (are expected to) do with their bodies, as well as what other pro-
fessionals do with the bodies of models, as it refers to the work that individuals
undertake on their bodies in private; to the practices through which bodies are
produced in the workplace; and to the paid work performed on the bodies of others
(Gimlin, 2002, 2007: 353).
Importantly, private body work and professional aesthetic labour are hardly
separable. The one continuously seeps into the other (Enwistle and Wissinger,
2006; Maguire, 2008). The enduring nature of aesthetic labour requires workers
to `always be on', as they need to adapt their whole lifestyle ­ their entire embodied
selves ­ to professional aesthetic imperatives (Entwistle and Wissinger, 2006: 783).
By analogy to Hochschild's emotion work (Hochschild, 1979), body work further
implies that the embodiment of aesthetics is practised most successfully when it is
done through constraint, concealment and containment (Young, 1990). Moreover,
much body work is reflexive, carried out with the primary purpose of `acting back
upon the body, so as to modify, maintain or thematise it in some way' (Crossley,
2005: 9). And finally, body work is gendered. Even though men are increasingly
subjected to more rigorous norms of physical beauty, Gimlin notes that, still,
Holla 5
`women are expected to engage in a larger number of body management practices,
spend more effort and money on them, and be more concerned about them
than men' (2007: 354). In fashion modelling, slender aesthetics do not merely
apply to female models: male models too are concerned with controlling their
bodily measurements and size (Entwistle, 2004). Whether and how eating in fash-
ion modelling is gendered is explored by looking at differences in beliefs about food
affecting male and female model-bodies that possibly result in gendered eating
practices.
Linking food talk to food practice through
person-centred ethnography
To investigate the relation between food beliefs and eating practices in fashion
modelling, I draw on in-depth interviews and participant observation, often accom-
panied by interviewees. Between March 2011 and March 2013, I interviewed
36 models in Amsterdam, Paris and Warsaw, cities that are all part of the trans-
national field of fashion modelling. Some of these models became key informants
and were interviewed more than once. I spoke to fashion photographers, bookers,
scouts, fashion designers, magazine editors, stylists, make-up artists and a fashion
modelling coach. Most informants were recruited during fashion events, with some
of them recruiting further informants from their social networks. This chain-
referral sampling allowed for insights into the social network connecting these
actors and provided access to people I would not otherwise have been able to
reach. In terms of the selection, as far as possible I paid attention to factors
likely to influence informants' practices and experiences, such as gender, age,
ethnicity, nationality, city and position in the modelling field (commercial or
high-end). However, variation in fashion models is limited due to existing conven-
tions of gender, class, age and ethnicity, so the informants consist mainly of young,
tall, slim, mostly white fashion models, the majority of them female (22 or 61%).
Interviews lasted between one and two hours, were recorded with permission of the
informants, and mostly took place in restaurants and cafe
´ s in the city centre.
To identify relevant themes, topics and issues, all interviews were transcribed,
inductively coded, and studied through thematic and narrative analyses
(Riessman, 2005: 2, 5).
Investigating fashion professionals' narratives on food enabled me to discern
`the emotional landscape of desire, morality and expectations' they inhabit (Pugh,
2013: 50 in Jerolmack and Khan, 2014: 3). In addition, fashion models' narratives
were used to make inferences about their eating practices. The method of person-
centred ethnography (Hollan, 2001) proved to be particularly useful as it permits a
focus on people's practical involvement in the world and explains social practices
and behaviour from the experiential perspective of acting, intending and attentive
subjects (Hollan, 2001: 55). This method enabled me to witness and apprehend
(on several occasions) how fashion models deal with food in relation to their
bodies. As a participant observer, I learned how models eat at different times
6 Ethnography 0(00)
and in various situations. I also learned about the rationale behind it, by simul-
taneously engaging in `food talk' with them. At a model's home, I engaged in
cooking and eating supper with her. While going out to bars and clubs in
Warsaw, Paris and Brussels, I engaged in drinking with models. Working as a
stylist assistant, a director's assistant or as a model myself, I closely observed
how food was dealt with, or shunned, in back stages of fashion shows and shoots.
Observations were written down in field reports and analysed thematically.
Comparing these different but mutually complementary sources resulted in com-
prehensive, `thick descriptive' ethnographic narratives of models' eating practices,
their food classifications and the institutional food system in which these practices
and classifications make sense.
Good, bad, dangerous and healthy foods
Fashion modelling is a physically, emotionally and personally demanding profes-
sion (Entwistle and Wissinger, 2006; Mears, 2011; Soley-Beltran, 2006), character-
ized by high levels of implicit and explicit forms of discipline and control (Mears,
2011; Czerniawski, 2015; Neff et al., 2005). Fashion models are expected to possess
specific physical features that comply with institutional standards of tallness,
youthfulness, slenderness and ­ very often ­ whiteness as well (Entwistle and
Wissinger, 2013; Mears, 2011). All models are expected to conform to these
aesthetic conventions: once under contract, they are disciplined to maintain or
improve their bodies through body work. While skin-color and body-length are
fixed, body-size can be altered. When starting at an agency, models' body meas-
urements are often explicitly assessed by means of a measure tape. As they are
frequently required to size down, young models quickly learn to turn their body
into an object that they rigorously monitor and work upon (Mears and Finlay,
2005: 319; Mears, 2011; Wissinger, 2015). Controlling their food-intake is therefore
the main and most crucial body practice fashion models engage in.
Professionals in fashion modelling believe that many, if not most, foodstuffs are
obstructive to maintaining or attaining the required model-body. For both male
and female fashion models, the greatest challenge for models is to apply the stand-
ard of slenderness, which takes on more extreme levels at the high-end of modelling
(Van der Laan, 2015). Beginning models unavoidably deal with slenderness when
they enter the field. Agents, clients, designers and coaches, who uphold fashion
aesthetics, socialize models into their role of embodying them. A considerable part
of learning how to be a model consists of becoming knowledgeable about good and
safe, bad and dangerous foods. Classifying foods into these institutionally relevant
categories is an important part of modelling.
Focusing on these classifications, this section unravels the knowledges on food
that circulate in the field of fashion modelling. These knowledges sometimes
contradict each other and are not necessarily factual. I refer to them as food beliefs
that provide guidance in assessing models' eating practices in terms of what is
good. As such, food beliefs form the basis for moral judgements models make
Holla 7
about themselves and others, and other fashion professionals make about them (cf.
Coveney, 2001: viii).
Although the viewpoints of various informants are presented, I discuss the
beliefs of two informants in particular: Natasha, a female commercial model
from Amsterdam, and Timothy, a French self-proclaimed model coach. They rep-
resent two groups in the field with different tasks. Natasha is illustrative of models
who classify foods according to certain beliefs about their effects. Her classifica-
tions of good and bad foods, as well as her eating practices, do not always corres-
pond with those of other models. But the fact that she classifies food, like Nahima
from the introduction, is typical. By simultaneously discussing, preparing and
eating food together, I learned how beliefs, classifications and practices relate:
Natasha's food beliefs result in categorical food classifications upon which she
engages in specific eating practices. Model coach Timothy, on the other hand, is
representative of models' `socializers'. This professional group, consisting of
agents, clients, nutritionists, coaches, but also stylists and designers, upholds and
enforces bodily standards and fulfils a pedagogical task of influencing models'
behaviour towards their own bodies.
I meet Natasha, a 19-year-old model, at a local fashion event in the city centre of
Amsterdam. We subsequently get together several times to talk about her model-
ling career. After our second interview in a bistro, Natasha invites me to her home
to cook dinner and eat together. I happily accept her invitation. In her small kit-
chen we sort out the products she has bought and we discuss the foods we will eat.
Natasha elaborates on the foodstuffs that make her put on weight and how she tries
to avoid that. Like many female models, Natasha has collected information on
calories and physical effects of every foodstuff entering our conversation. This
evening we prepare baked vegetables with spices and chicken. Our meal does not
include carbohydrate loading foods like rice, potatoes, bread or pasta. Natasha
tells me she never buys or prepares these kinds of food. During lunch, which
typically consists of sandwiches in the Netherlands, Natasha eats soup (without
croutons) or salad (without bread on the side). The majority of female models
avoid carbohydrates. These are generally thought of as detrimental to a model's
body. According to model coach Timothy ­ a former professional basketball player
and much concerned with physical activity and metabolic rates ­ carbohydrates
stock up as fat when they do not get burned. Moreover, Natasha adds, high-carb
foods are difficult to measure:
Although pasta and bread are healthier than chocolate and cheese, you never cook
just five pieces of pasta. You always eat a lot of it, always too much. If you start eating
pasta, you keep on eating, even though you don't need that amount of carbohydrates
for your body. That's how you gain weight. One piece of chocolate is satisfying. So in
the end, that's much better.
Natasha and I cut up several ingredients and start cooking. She pours a small dash
of olive oil in a frying pan and heats it up on the stove. She tells me she never uses
8 Ethnography 0(00)
butter when preparing meals. During periods when she is extra attentive to her
weight, she uses a shallow layer of water instead of oil to keep the food from
burning. We bake 800 grams (two bags containing exactly 400 grams) of mixed,
pre-chopped vegetables together with the garlic and ginger which we have cut
ourselves. While I stir the vegetables, Natasha dry-grills pieces of seasoned chicken
breast. Natasha only eats `white meat' ­ predominantly chicken breast and white
fish. Like most female models, she avoids red meat, charcuterie and pork. I am told
that these `coloured meats' contain a lot of fat and proteins. Proteins are not
necessarily seen as bad, because they are beneficial for generating muscle tissue.
However, when models do not exercise their muscles, proteins are assumed to
turn into fat. Coach Timothy notes that especially high-end male and female
models should be cautious with eating red meat: these models mainly engage in
cardiovascular workouts, because they require a slim and straight instead of
a muscular body. Female commercial models, who are valued for their slender
but slightly curved and toned shapes, are allowed to eat red meat only very
rarely. Male commercial models, on the contrary, often embody a more hetero-
normative masculinity (Entwistle and Mears, 2013) that aesthetically translates
into a muscular, v-shaped body-type, with broad, well-defined shoulders and an
abdominal six (or eight) pack. Since they train their muscles frequently, they are
supposed to benefit from feeding their bodies proteins by eating red meat. Timothy
argues, however, that models who want to lose weight should avoid all kinds
of meat and most types of fish. Interestingly, he classifies fish according to its
colour, as Natasha does for meat. They both assume that the whiter the meat,
the lesser the grease:
Better eat fish instead. But never eat salmon, it's very fat. It's not white fish anyway, so
you should avoid it. This goes for tuna too by the way. So sushi should be put aside as
well. If you have a real objective you must be strict like that. And go to the gym,
morning and night.
To give our meal some additional flavour, Natasha pours Japanese soy sauce over
it. This is the only sauce she uses, because unlike others, it contains few calories, no
fat and little sugar. According to Timothy, sauces are problematic and often spoil a
potentially good meal. Here, the classification of good reflects an appreciation of
low-calorie foods:
At night my models eat steamed vegetables, and they can eat as many as they like. But
then there's the question of the sauce. People just put too much sauce on everything.
Dressings, with oil! It's catastrophic. Better put some herbs in your salad instead of
sauce.
Both Natasha and Timothy use caloric value as an index of the food hierarchy
(cf. Douglas, 1972: 64) and disapprove of foods with carbohydrates. They rank
vegetables higher than any other foodstuff.
Holla 9
Dinner is cooked and Natasha and I start to eat. Along with the meal we drink
water with lemon squeezed into it, which is Natasha's favourite drink: `it's healthy,
free of calories and lemon stimulates the burning of fat'. Natasha never drinks
sugary sodas, fruit juices or milk. This is contrary to other models who drink full-
fat milk in their cafe
´ lattes, usually as a stand-in for breakfast or lunch, during
interviews. Coach Timothy is sceptical about models consuming dairy, and any
other fat-containing foodstuffs:
Models should avoid drinking milk. Dairy makes you fat. Yoghurt is not bad obvi-
ously, but better use soy products instead. Eggs should also be avoided, the yolk is
very fat. It's a catastrophe to eat the yolk. If you only eat the white it's fine. No nuts,
no almonds. It's all too fat. Better eat white fish instead of nuts.
The meal is finished, which is the moment I usually get cravings for sweet things.
My thoughts about cookies bring me to asking Natasha whether and when she eats
sugary foods. She tells me that fruits are her primary source of good sugar. In the
morning she eats fresh fruit mixed with low-fat yoghurt, usually half an apple and a
kiwi or some strawberries. Like Nahima, she does not drink fruit juices, because
they supposedly contain added, bad, processed sugars. Even when nothing has
been added, the condensed nature of fruit juice ­ `imagine three apples, one
banana and eight strawberries in one drink!' ­ makes it a bomb of calories to
Natasha.
Although eating fruit is deemed better than drinking it, there are limits to how
much fruit models can eat. Macy from Amsterdam tells me she sometimes has the
munchies and binges on a whole bag of apples: `It's very bad to do that, because
you eat way too much sugar' (Macy, 22, Amsterdam). In addition, not all kinds of
fruits are allowed to be eaten by models. Coach Timothy notes:
[Models should eat] no sugar. Very little fruit, except fruit containing lots of water,
like watermelon. Bananas are forbidden, because they contain most sugar and fat.
Apples are not bad, they're okay, but you shouldn't let yourself go with them either.
Then, finally, there is the issue of timing. According to several models, fruits cannot
be eaten after a certain time of the day. High-end model Mirthe from Warsaw
explains:
We can eat fruits, but not every fruit, because fruits have a lot of sugar. We can eat
watermelon, but that's not there right now [in winter]. So we can eat apples. But you
can only eat fruits before three in the afternoon, because later in the day you have to
burn all these calories, but you can't. (Mirthe, 20, Paris/Warsaw)
The issue of timing relates to beliefs about the body, and how it reacts to foods.
Fruit is classified according to calories and sugar level, but importantly, also by
how it is thought to interact with the human metabolism, which is believed to
10 Ethnography 0(00)
become slower as a day progresses. The timing of eating is also relevant with regard
to immediate effects on the body's visible surface. Various female models refrain
from eating the morning or evening prior to a photo shoot or runway show,
because they require a flat belly when appearing in the spotlight. Especially
when showing lingerie or swimwear, models fear a full stomach makes their belly
look bloated. Sometimes, not eating before a job is explicitly advised by clients:
In Japan . . . when you have the job they call you and say: `remember, don't eat break-
fast!' Because your stomach will be blown. (Rita, 27, Warsaw)
Although Natasha frowns upon models who `starve themselves and don't have a
healthy and regular diet', she too refrains from eating the morning prior to body-
revealing photo shoots. The day and evening before a job she eats, but abstains
from foods that fill up her stomach too much. Rather than a large plate of vege-
tables, she will eat something nutritious and small, like a piece of cheese or a small
sandwich ­ foods she regularly avoids.
The way the body responds to different foods is seen as predictable, even cal-
culable. For example, when Timothy formulates nutritional advice to models, he
also considers how much models exercise, as this affects the amount of carbohy-
drates models can eat: `if you want to eat bread and pasta, the gym should be your
very best friend.. . . When you do only a little bit of exercise every day, I guess you
shouldn't [eat that]'. He seems to think of models' bodies as machines, of which the
input (eaten calories) and output (burned calories) can be precisely quantified
(Turner, 1982: 258).
Natasha speaks of her body not as a machine but as a learning organism that
can be purposefully sensitized about what it is enduring. During our dinner,
Natasha eats in a concentrated manner, taking well-measured portions onto her
fork and chewing meticulously. She finishes her plate calmly, almost systematically.
She explains the more you chew on food before swallowing, the better you digest it.
Moreover, slow eating prevents overeating, because the body gets enough time to
realize it is being fed and becoming full. Through the practice of slow eating,
Natasha makes her body `aware' of being filled with food.
Finally, the body is believed to be in need of sanitizing. Some foodstuffs, but
also skin cosmetics and polluted air, are seen as contaminating the body. Fat, for
example, is dangerous for clogging the pores, in addition to its high caloric value.
For maintaining the clear and smooth skin that is required from fashion models,
the body should be cleaned through drinking lots of water and green tea. Herbal
tea and water, Natasha says, are healthy for flushing toxins out of her body. Coach
Timothy agrees: `Green tea is detoxing. It allows the body to expel stuff, so it's
good for the skin'.
Classifying foods is a recurrent practice in the field of fashion modelling.
Importantly, this not only results in categorizations of foods (see Table 1).
Through the practice of classification models are also positioned and position
themselves in relation to food: a `good model' knows what (not) to eat in order
Holla 11
to maintain his or her model-body up to standards. Food categories are formulated
in moral terms and express the institutionally entrenched aesthetic purpose of
remaining or becoming thin. Therefore, calories especially are perceived as danger-
ous, and even immoral, as they potentially relate to fat. Hence, they are rarely
discussed simply as a unit of energy. Accordingly, the standard of slenderness
renders other potential food categories, like tasty, satisfying or affordable,
irrelevant.
From external control to self-control
Based upon their classifications models act upon food. However, models are often
young and inexperienced when they enter the field and first have to learn how to
`eat like a model'. This requires socialization, taken up by fashion professionals like
agents, clients, coaches or nutritionists, who regulate or train models' attitudes
towards food. This renders something seemingly personal and mundane, like decid-
ing whether or not to eat a banana at lunch time, part of deliberate professional
decision-making. Modelling agents especially are inclined to regulate models' food-
intake. However, some show themselves more involved than others. Maggie, the

director of a leading agency in Warsaw, employs a nutritionist to help debutant
models develop a `balanced diet' against the backdrop of slender aesthetic stand-
ards. When models work abroad, some agents accompany them to restaurants,
where they control what and how much food models eat:
In Italy they [the agencies] told me to eat sushi. Models have so much trouble over
there with all that pasta and pizza around. So they check on you, what you eat. The
agencies take you out to dinner in the evening so they know what you order. (Rita, 27,
Warsaw)
The external control of models' food-intake does not always happen sensibly.
Talking with Mirthe from Warsaw, I notice she looks somewhat feeble. She
explains she has just finished a lingerie shoot, for which she abstained from
eating the previous evening. Unfortunately, she did not have the opportunity to
eat during or after the shoot, meaning she had not eaten for a full day. Mirthe
discloses that, in the past, food has been kept away from her purposefully:
They give you food occasionally, like salad or a sandwich, but sometimes they say: `no
you can't eat, you're a model, shut up'. . . . When I was very young, 15, I was doing a
show here in Warsaw. They didn't give me one meal, from six a.m. to eight p.m. I only
got a small sandwich. Everyone was on water and cigarettes, which is kind of the diet
backstage. . . . I was going to the runway, but I was weak and I fainted. An ambulance
brought me to the hospital. One year later I was doing the same show and they gave
me food, even chocolate! So they learned from it.
Such meticulous, intrusive management of models' eating is rare: most models tell
me they are self-reliant in controlling their food-intake, because their agencies
consider it an individual affair. Offering models none or imprecise advice, their
guidance often limits itself to up-close surveillance and regulation of hip, waist and
chest circumventions by means of a measure tape. Models are simply told to eat
less whenever they measure too many centimetres. Starting at an agency in Paris,
fashion model Daphne heard she had to lose three centimetres from her hips: `I was
like, ``okay, how should I do that?'' He said: ``don't throw up and don't take
drugs''. That was about all the advice I got' (Daphne, 21, Amsterdam).
Although the aesthetic result of models' eating practices ­ slenderness ­ is a
collective goal, paradoxically, striving to achieve it through controlled eating is not
always supported, let alone recognized, by professionals working with models.
Coach Timothy critically notes:
All their agencies tell them is to withhold food from themselves, but they don't get into
the question of how to do that. I know girls that only eat white cheese. Morning, day
and night. Only that. In the morning they add some granola, at night they throw in
some strawberries. End of story, good night. It's ridiculous. You have to eat varied.
To eat very little, but varied.
Holla 13
Timothy is concerned about models `who do stupid things' to remain or become
slender, like eating only one kind of foodstuff, such as white cheese or broccoli.
Although Timothy deems this both unhealthy as well as impossible to keep up,
such monotonous regimes enable models to precisely calculate their caloric intake:
it is a way of staying in control. Inversely, eating varied is likely to cause insecurity,
as losing count is felt as losing control. What makes matters worse, he claims, is the
fact that fashion models generally live irregular lives, which makes eating regularly,
healthy and varied extra difficult:
Models are on and off the airplane constantly, working in different countries. They
experience jetlag, miss out on sleep . . . and can't cook their own meals. When the
money comes in they want to relax for a while. Of course, understandable. But
then they take a holiday and let themselves go. They eat, drink, spend their money.
I say they'd better get back into the gym straight away and save up their money to
invest in a house or education. But instead they gain weight and once they want to get
back to work, because they're out of money, they have to go on some crazy diet,
because their sizes aren't right anymore.
Timothy is obviously sceptical of the idea that models are able to `give themselves a
break' from time to time, depicting this as a way of disturbing models' physical
balance. Conversely, Natasha believes she actually maintains balance by not deny-
ing herself pleasures of taste. She wants herself to stay sane and her profession to
remain humane, which is why she allows herself a piece of chocolate or cheese every
now and then. Importantly, Natasha is speaking about a mental balance instead of
a physical one: `If you really never eat those things, you go crazy. I won't eat a plate
of spaghetti or a chunk of white bread, but a little bit of sugar or fat at times is
okay. It's all a matter of quantity'. According to Timothy however, in-betweens
pose models too big a challenge:
Taking in-betweens, like a piece of chocolate, will make you think about chocolate.
The next morning you pass by the cupboard where you've stored the rest of the bar,
and it will lure you. You'll think `well I took a piece yesterday and I didn't gain
weight, so why couldn't I take another little piece today!' You have to be strong in
your mind, you see.
Indeed, such `controlled decontrolling' might be the most challenging form of food-
control, as it requires the highest level of self-control (Elias and Dunning, 1986).
Appetite, the desire to eat, is a compelling force (Mennell, 1996: 21). This goes for
hunger even more.
In back-stages of shows and shoots, models are sometimes treated with sweets
and snacks, by which their self-control is tested. In Paris, Amsterdam and Warsaw,
I observed models surrounded with `bad foods': candies, cookies, crisps or cheese
sandwiches ­ all things models try to avoid eating ­ while good foods, such as
soups or salads, were absent. To resist temptations of sugar and fat, some models
14 Ethnography 0(00)
bring their own food to the set. During Warsaw Fashion Weekend, several models
were nibbling on self-brought rice cakes and whole-wheat slices of bread, avoiding
the jars of sweets.
An often mentioned bad foodstuff that entices the appetite to the extent that
models lose their self-control are crisps. Commercial model Lynn (19, Amsterdam)
used to habitually eat crisps with her boyfriend. Each time she opened a bag she
could not bring herself to stop eating until it was empty. She gained weight, which
got her into trouble: `My agency deleted my pictures from their website. They told
me they'd place them back only after I would lose at least three centimetres around
my hips'. Lynn's agency fully held her responsible for her added centimetres
(cf. O'Neill and Silver, 2017: 121). Eventually, Lynn took hard measures to
regain self-control: to refrain from eating crisps she started spending her evenings
at a gym instead of with her boyfriend, with whom she broke up.
Finally, some fashion professionals entirely repudiate the idea that eating is an
important and complicated part of models' body work. An Amsterdam stylist
claims that `good models shouldn't need to mind what they eat. If they do, I tell
them to give it up, because they are simply not fit to be a model' (Dave, 44,
Amsterdam). This narrative defines good models as uncontrolled eaters, and estab-
lishes a norm of effortlessness. Yet, for most models eating good is a challenge.
A significant food practice is therefore to not be straightforward about food.
Several models demonstrate they are good models by emphasizing that modelling
comes natural to them, without making effort (cf. Holla, 2016). Other models avoid
talking about their own dealings with food, while being blunt about how other
models deal with food in extreme and `wrong' ways. They tell second-hand stories
about crash dieting, binge-eating, vomiting, drinking vinegar, eating tissues or
replacing food with drugs. Chantal tells me that she `lived in a model house with
these girls who only ate apple compote. I was really the odd one out over there'
(Chantal, 22, Amsterdam). Rita notes that: `there are some girls that have such
fucked ideas. I had this roommate, she was drinking pure vinegar after a meal.
Because she heard it helped digest' (Rita, 27, Warsaw).
While I am unsure whether all of these stories reflect actual practices, they surely
serve models to draw symbolic boundaries between the self and others (Lamont,
1992). In these narratives, it is always other models who are `out of control' or `try
too hard' to become or remain slender. These symbolic boundaries clearly show
two main moral imperatives on food in fashion modelling: models should eat in
both a controlled and effortless way.
Models try to solve the moral paradox through alternatively framing their
eating practices. Even the ones with plain, austere nutritional regimes, like
Nahima from the introduction, normalize their eating practices, using the careless
expression of `watching my food'. They emphasize they do not diet, which is seen
as a forced, unnatural and therefore illegitimate way of eating. By contrast,
through watching their food models demonstrate they engage in a sane,
healthy and unforced way of eating, without losing track of what they put into
their bodies.
Holla 15
Importantly, the taboo of (overly) controlled eating, which spurs fashion models
to demonstrate that they are effortless, seems to hold especially for female models.
A possible explanation for the genderedness of this taboo is that it links to the
persistent risk of institutional weight and body-size requirements to induce eating
disorders (Shilling, 2012: 105; Swami and Szmigielska, 2013). As disordered eating
is perceived to be ultimately a feminine risk, this might explain why mostly female
models go out of their way to demonstrate they do not obsess over food.
The moralities of control and effortlessness complicate eating as a professional
aesthetic practice. By disallowing openness on food as an important issue, and
creating a taboo about putting in effort, models are left by themselves in their
task to embody slender aesthetics. While perpetually caught up in body work for
aesthetic purposes, they are simultaneously concerned with concealing it. The per-
ception of modelling success as an individual responsibility pushes models toward
continuous efforts of self-improvement (Neff et al., 2005: 320).
Accordingly, models are held fully accountable for their bodies: any failure to
conform to aesthetic standards is interpreted as an individual lack of discipline and
self-control. This reinforces the winner-takes-all principle of fashion modelling
(Mears, 2011). In the quest for success, the law of the strongest applies. Models
who are `out of control', such as Lynn, receive little mercy and irrevocably dis-
appear from the stage. In turn, overly self-controlling models, who `try too hard'
are also viewed as unable to make it in the long run. Finally, eating the right way
is a three-fold challenge for fashion models: an aesthetic, moral as well as a
personal one.
A gendered division of food?
Beliefs on how the model-body reacts to food, and the rules on how it should be
controlled, differ for male and female models, as their bodies are considered to
react somewhat differently to food. While fashion modelling mostly revolves
around feminine looks, female model-bodies are perceived a jeopardy. Models
and other professionals consider female bodies vulnerable to carbohydrates and
fat. Hence, they are as dangerous as they are eminent. Conversely, male model-
bodies are perceived more resistant to physiological infringements of food. As the
male model-body is believed to be less violable, practices of controlled eating are
prone to be defined as feminine.
However, the genderedness of food control intersects with the division between
high and low aesthetics that exists in modelling, making it a `high-end concern' as
well (Mears, 2011; Van der Laan, 2015). The `sexual division of dieting' (Germov
and Williams, 1996) only holds in commercial modelling, where female models
watch their food, but male models repetitively state they eat and drink whatever
they crave. Through this, they enact an appropriate heteronormative masculinity
(Connell, 1995). Felix, for example, says: `I eat normally. Also bread, French fries
and Coca Cola. As long as I go to the gym I'm okay' (Felix, 24, Amsterdam).
Instead of rendering his body passive by withholding it from eating, Felix endows
16 Ethnography 0(00)
himself an active role, by managing his body through exercise ­ a self-objectifying
practice that compensates for uncontrolled eating and is gender-role confirming.
Conversely, high-end male models engage in controlled eating in rather similar
ways as female models. Jim, a high-end model working for luxury brands such as
Prada and Jil Sander, watches his food to a considerable extent. I meet him in the
home of a befriended model, where they are planning to cook dinner together.
They agree on preparing carrot soup and a salad. While making the grocery list, he
requests the salad to be without meat and says he cannot drink wine along with
the meal, because: `I'm going back to Milan soon. I have to be strict with myself'
(Jim, 23, Warsaw).
The contrast between male and female eating practices dissolves the further one
moves towards higher-ends of fashion modelling, where gender distinctions are less
pronounced and bodily aesthetic standards for both male and female models are
characterized as androgen, at times non-sexual or even adolescent. Overly visible
signs of a body/self that is masculine or feminine are avoided: all high-end models
are required to be thin and straight. Finally, food becomes more gender-neutral
towards the higher-ends of fashion modelling.
Discussion and conclusion
This paper investigated the relation between food, the body and morality in the
field of fashion modelling and found that the food beliefs that structure the aes-
thetic labour of fashion models render `eating like a model' complicated and exten-
sive. More than has been recognized in modelling studies so far, eating is a
continuous and reflexive form of body work that is decidedly essential to
models' aesthetic labour.
Fashion professionals classify different foods and ways of eating them as more
or less obstructive to the embodiment of slenderness. Caloric food in particular is
framed as dangerous (cf. Douglas, 2003) and needing to be controlled in different
ways. Nonetheless, controlled eating entails more than counting calories: it is about
eating a variety of good foods, in the right quantities, at the right time. Food is
valued for its low caloric value, but also because it is believed to stimulate diges-
tion, to detoxify the body, or to burn body-fat. However, food is believed to have
different effects on male and female model-bodies, which results in gendered food
rules. This genderedness intersects with an institutional division between high and
low aesthetics, which inclines high-end male models to control their food-intake
just like female models.
Eating the right way is a three-fold challenge in fashion modelling: an aesthetic,
moral as well as a personal one. First, eating is geared explicitly at aesthetic
professional purposes and is therefore a job requirement for fashion models.
Their decisions on whether, what, or how much to eat include a recurring differ-
entiation between their selves as choosing subjects and their bodies as shapable and
controllable objects (cf. Czerniawski, 2015). With every bite they (do not) take,
models are prone to consider their professional status as aesthetic objects to be
Holla 17
displayed: they are `permanent overseers of their own bodies' (Mears and Finlay,
2005: 333).
Second, food beliefs include moral imperatives that further complicate good
eating for fashion models. By framing food-control as an individual responsibility
and slenderness as an individual achievement, models are thrown back on their
own capacities of self-control, and they are also held fully accountable when they
fail to comply to slender aesthetics. Controlled eating ultimately renders models
preoccupied with self-surveillance and self-objectification, and subjugated by agen-
cies and clients. Food beliefs therefore reinforce power-inequalities between models
and other professionals.
Along with the imperative of food control exists the idea that `truly good
models' achieve aesthetic standards effortlessly. This creates a taboo around prac-
tices of food-control which, paradoxically, de-legitimizes controlled eating. This
does not result, however, in a casual attitude towards food, but rather renders
practices concealed. Food is rarely not an issue for models, even ­ or especially ­
when food is absent or treated as a non-topic. However, the moral paradox of
control and effortlessness does result in normalizing narratives on food-control.
Especially female models normalize their sober eating practices by using the care-
less expression of `watching my food'. The taboo of (overly) controlled eating is
possibly explained by the persistent risk of eating disorders, caused by the indus-
try's weight and body-size requirements. As disordered eating is perceived to be
ultimately a feminine risk, this might explain why mostly female models go out of
their way to demonstrate they do not obsess over food.
This analysis of model's food practices has implications for theories of aesthetic
labour and aesthetic capital, as well as studies of food. First, the importance of
food and eating practices stretches beyond fashion modelling, as it pertains to
aesthetic professions more generally. This paper empirically substantiates the
thesis of Entwistle and Wissinger (2006) on the enduring and demanding nature
of the aesthetic labour and adds that the centrality of food and eating in the work
and life of aesthetic labourers is the primary cause for the personal and the pro-
fessional, the physical and the emotional, to seep into each other to such a great
extent. Second, the food system in fashion modelling can enhance interpretations
of how people in society at large deal with food in relation to their bodies. Against
the backdrop of an increasing aesthetization of work and life (Featherstone, 1991),
beauty has become a quality that `pays' and hence a source of inequality
(Hamermesh, 2011). As the ones who are not seen as attractive miss out and
find themselves disadvantaged, making sure the body is slender is an imperative
that exists well beyond aesthetic industries.
Finally, looking at eating in a delineated institutional context potentially
enriches understandings of contemporary foody cultures (cf. Cairns et al., 2010)
that consist of ethically-consuming, upper/middle-class urbanites that embrace
food-reflexive life-styles (cf. Guthman, 2003). Models are possibly a vanguard of
such social developments. In fashion modelling, eating demarcates boundaries:
cultural ones, based on gendered bodies and high-low aesthetics, and moral
18 Ethnography 0(00)
ones, based on the seemingly conflicting norms of control and effortlessness. Just as
`good eating models' are identified ­ by others and themselves ­ as good models (cf.
Holla, 2016), contemporary foodies, slow-eaters, vegans, flexitarians and other
(non-professional) reflexive eaters use food to morally position themselves vis-a
` -
vis others. There is a difference though. In contrast to these non-professional
reflexive eaters, models are unequivocally held accountable for their eating: they
might lose their job over it.
