OBJECTIVE -- While the measurement of waist circumference (WC) is recommended in
current clinical guidelines, its clinical utility was questioned in a recent consensus statement. In
response, we sought to determine whether WC predicts diabetes and cardiovascular disease
(CVD) beyond that explained by BMI and commonly obtained cardiometabolic risk factors
including blood pressure, lipoproteins, and glucose.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Subjects consisted of 5,882 adults from the
1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is nationally represen-
tative and cross-sectional. Subjects were grouped into sex-specific WC and BMI tertiles. Blood
pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and glucose were categorized using standard
clinical thresholds. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds for diabetes and
CVD according to WC tertiles.
RESULTS -- After controlling for basic confounders, the medium and high WC tertiles were
more likely to have diabetes and CVD compared with the low WC tertile (P  0.05). After
inclusion of BMI and cardiometabolic risk factors in the regression models, the magnitude of the
odds ratios were attenuated (i.e., for diabetes the magnitude decreased from 6.54 to 5.03 for the
high WC group) but remained significant in the medium and high WC tertiles for the prediction
of diabetes, though not for CVD.
CONCLUSIONS -- WC predicted diabetes, but not CVD, beyond that explained by tradi-
tional cardiometabolic risk factors and BMI. The findings lend critical support for the recom-
mendation that WC be a routine measure for identification of the high-risk, abdominally obese
patient.

It is established that waist circumfer-
ence (WC) predicts increased risk of
morbidity (1­4) and mortality (5) be-
yond that explained by BMI alone. Several
organizations, including the National In-
stitutes of Health (6), currently advocate
for the measurement of WC in clinical
practice. However, a recent consensus
statement from the American Diabetes
Association (ADA), the Obesity Society,
and the American Society for Nutrition
questioned the clinical utility of WC mea-
surement (7). Opposition to the inclusion
of WC measurement in clinical practice is
hinged on the observation that it is un-
clear whether WC predicts health risk be-
yond that explained by BMI and
commonly evaluated cardiometabolic
risk factors (7). It is reasoned that clini-
cians would be unnecessarily burdened
by the measurement of WC if this mea-
sure failed to explain health risk beyond
the risk factors routinely obtained in clin-
ical practice.
Limited evidence suggests that WC
predicts risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) after control for hypertension
(1,2), hypercholesterolemia (2), and the
apolipoprotein B­to­A ratio (1). Absent
from the literature is a clear demonstra-
tion that WC predicts the risk of diabetes
and CVD in men and women beyond that
explained by the commonly evaluated
cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pres-
sure, triglyceride, LDL and HDL choles-
terol, and glucose levels) and BMI. We
addressed this issue using data from the
most recent National Health and Nutri-
tion Survey (NHANES).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The study sample was
obtained from the 1999­2000, 2001­
2002, and 2003­2004 NHANES.
NHANES was designed to be a nationally
representative cross-sectional survey,
which allows for two or three survey
rounds to be combined, as done here.
NHANES was conducted by the U.S. Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics to esti-
mate the prevalence of major diseases,
nutritional disorders, and risk factors for
these diseases. The sampling plan used a
stratified, multistage, probability cluster
design. Full details of the study design
and procedures are available elsewhere
(8). Informed consent was obtained
from all participants and the protocol ap-
proved by the National Center for Health
Statistics.
Participants who were aged 18
years, pregnant women, or missing waist
circumference, BMI, outcome measures,
or covariates required for the analyses
were excluded from this study. This left a

total of 5,882 subjects (3,001 men and
2,881 women).
Measurement and classification of
anthropometric variables
WC was measured during minimal respi-
ration to the nearest 0.1 cm at the level of
the iliac crest (8). Height was measured to
the nearest 0.1 cm and body mass to the
nearest 0.1 kg (8). BMI was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by the square
of height in meters. Subjects were divided
into sex-specific tertiles for WC and BMI.
We divided the subjects into WC and BMI
tertiles instead of using commonly em-
ployed clinical thresholds to match the
groups for size both within (i.e., three
equally sized WC groups) and across (i.e.,
with high WC group the same size as high
BMI group) anthropometric measures. In
men, WC tertiles were defined by the fol-
lowing thresholds: 90.9, 90.9­102.9,
and 102.9 cm. The corresponding val-
ues in women were 85.5, 85.5­98.7,
and 98.7 cm. In men, BMI tertiles were
defined by the following thresholds:
24.8, 24.8­28.8, and 28.8 kg/m2.
The corresponding values in women were
24.6, 24.6­29.9, and 29.9 kg/m2.
Measurement and classification of
cardiometabolic risk factors
Blood pressure. Three blood pressure
measurements were obtained with the
subject in a seated position using a stan-
dard manual mercury sphygmomanome-
ter (8). The average of the three readings
was utilized. Blood pressure was classified
according to established guidelines (9):
normal (systolic 120 and diastolic 80
mmHg), prehypertension (systolic 120­
139 or diastolic 80­89 mmHg), or hyper-
tension (systolic 140 or diastolic 90
mmHg). When systolic and diastolic blood
pressures fell into different categories, the
higher category was selected for classifica-
tion. Participants who reported taking
blood pressure medication were considered
to have hypertension regardless of their
blood pressure measurements.
Lipids and lipoproteins. Blood samples
were obtained after an overnight fast for
the measurement of serum LDL choles-
terol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and
glucose as described in detail elsewhere
(8,10). Briefly, cholesterol and triglycer-
ide levels were measured enzymatically in
a series of coupled reactions hydrolyzing
cholesterol ester and triglyceride to cho-
lesterol and glycerol, respectively. LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyc-
eride levels were classified according to
the National Cholesterol Education Pro-
gram guidelines (11). LDL cholesterol
was categorized as optimal (100 mg/dl),
near optimal (100­129 mg/dl), border-
line high (130 ­159 mg/dl), or high
(160 mg/dl). Participants who reported
taking a cholesterol-lowering medication
were placed into the high LDL cholesterol
category regardless of their LDL choles-
terol level. HDL cholesterol was catego-
rized as low (40 mg/dl), normal (40­59
mg/dl), or high (60 mg/dl). Triglycer-
ides were categorized as normal (150
mg/dl), borderline high (150­199 mg/
dl), or high (200 mg/dl).
Glucose and diabetes. Fasting plasma
glucose samples were assayed using a hex-
okinase enzymatic method (8,12). Subjects
were classified as having normal glucose
(100 mg/dl), impaired fasting glucose
(100­125 mg/dl), or diabetes (126 mg/
dl) in accordance with ADA guidelines
(13). All participants with physician-
diagnosed diabetes (outside of preg-
nancy) were coded positive for diabetes,
as were those who reported using insulin
or blood glucose­lowering medications.
CVD. Participants who reported that a
physician had ever told them they had a
heart attack, stroke, angina, congestive
heart failure, or coronary heart disease
were coded positive for CVD. All other
participants were coded negative for CVD.
Confounding variables
Confounding variables included age,
race/ethnicity, sex, and smoking status.
Age was included in the analysis as a con-
tinuous variable. Race was categorized as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, and other. Subjects were con-
sidered current smokers if they smoked
cigarettes at the time of the interview, pre-
vious smokers if they were not current
smokers but had smoked 100 cigarettes in
their entire life, and nonsmokers if they
smoked less than this amount.
Statistical analysis
The Intercooled Stata program (version 7;
Stata, College Station, TX) was used to
properly weight the sample to be repre-
sentative of the U.S. population and to
take into account the complex sampling
strategy of the NHANES design. Initially,
logistic regression tests were used to ex-
amine associations among WC or BMI
categories, CVD, and diabetes. Three
models were run for each disease out-
come. The first model controlled for the
basic confounding variables (age, sex,
race, and smoking). The second model
controlled for the basic confounding vari-
ables and the risk factor categories for the
cardiometabolic variables (glucose cate-
gories were not controlled for in the dia-
betes analysis). The third model con-
trolled for the basic confounding vari-
ables, the cardiometabolic risk factor cat-
egories, and BMI (or WC) categories.
Next, subjects were cross-classified ac-
cording to WC (low, moderate, or high)
and the number of metabolic risk factors
(0, 1, 2, or 3), creating 12 different cat-
egories. Odds ratios (ORs) for CVD and
diabetes were then computed for these 12
groups. P for trend values were calculated
to determine whether the WC and meta-
bolic risk factor groups had independent
effects on CVD and diabetes.
To further explore the added value of
WC, we determined the discriminatory
ability of the diabetes and CVD models
(e.g., ability to correctly separate those
who did and did not have disease) using
the c statistic. For each disease outcome,
the c statistic was calculated for three sep-
arate models that included the following

and smoking), 2) demographics plus tra-
ditional risk factors (blood pressure, LDL
and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride cat-
egories), and 3) demographics, traditional
risk factors, and WC categories. The c sta-
tistic is identical to the area under the re-
ceiver operating characteristic curve, with
values ranging from 0.5 (no better than
chance alone) to 1.0 (perfect).
RESULTS -- The descriptive charac-
teristics of the study sample are contained
within Table 1 . Table 2 presents the re-
sults of the logistic regression models in
which WC groups were used to predict
the likelihood of having diabetes and
CVD. After controlling for age, sex, race,
and smoking, participants in the medium
and high WC groups were more likely to
have diabetes and CVD compared with
participants in the low WC group (P 
0.05). After inclusion of the cardiometa-
bolic risk factor categories in the logistic
regression models, the magnitude of the
ORs were attenuated but remained signif-
icant in the medium and high WC groups
for the prediction of diabetes (OR 1.98
[95% CI 1.26­3.11] and 4.62 [3.16­
6.75], respectively) but not for CVD. A
final set of logistic regression models in-
cluded BMI categories among the covari-
ates. After controlling for demographic
characteristics, smoking, cardiometabolic
risk factors categories, and BMI catego-
ries, the moderate and high WC catego-
ries remained predictive of a higher
likelihood of diabetes (2.32 [1.30­4.12]
and 5.03 [2.87­8.83], respectively) but
not CVD (P  0.1) (Table 2).
Table 3 presents the results of the lo-
gistic regression models in which BMI
groups were used to predict the likeli-
hood of having diabetes and CVD. After
controlling for age, sex, race, and smok-
ing, participants in the medium and high
BMI groups were more likely to have dia-
betes and CVD compared with partici-
pants in the low BMI group (P  0.05).
After the inclusion of cardiometabolic
risk factor categories in the logistic regres-
sion models, ORs for the medium and
high BMI categories were attenuated for
both diabetes and CVD, with only the
high BMI category remaining associated
with a greater risk of diabetes (OR 2.92
[95% CI 1.95­4.37]). Lastly, after inclu-
sion of WC in addition to demographic
characteristics, smoking, and cardiometa-
bolic risk factors, neither the moderate
nor the high BMI categories remained
predictive of a higher likelihood of diabe-
tes or CVD (P  0.1) (Table 3).
To further illustrate the effect of WC,
we divided the study participants into
groups based on their number of high-
risk metabolic variables. We then cross-
tabulated the WC and cardiometabolic
risk factor groups to form 12 WC  met-
abolic risk factor groups. As illustrated in
Fig. 1A, both WC and cardiometabolic
risk factor groups were independent pre-
dictors of diabetes (Ptrend
 0.001); i.e.,
for a given number of cardiometabolic
risk factors, the likelihood of having dia-
betes increased when moving from the
low to high WC groups. Conversely,
within a given WC group, the likelihood
of having diabetes increased when mov-
ing from the group with no cardiometa-
bolic risk factors to the group with three
or more. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, cardio-
metabolic risk factor groups, but not WC
groups, significantly predicted CVD.
Thus, for a given number of cardiometa-
bolic risk factors, the likelihood of having
CVD was not different across WC groups
(Ptrend
 0.415).

Finally, the c statistic was calculated
to determine the discriminatory ability of
diabetes and CVD models. For diabetes,
the c statistic increased from 0.77 to 0.80
to 0.82 across modes that included basic
demographic characteristics; demograph-
ics plus traditional risk factor categories;
and demographics, traditional risk fac-
tors, and waist circumference categories,
respectively. The corresponding c statistic
values for the CVD models were 0.83,
0.85, and 0.85.
CONCLUSIONS -- The primary
finding of this study is that WC predicts
the likelihood of diabetes beyond that ex-
plained by commonly evaluated cardiom-
etabolic risk factors and BMI. Conversely,
BMI did not predict diabetes after consid-
eration of common cardiometabolic risk
factors and WC. Although both elevated
WC and BMI were associated with greater
CVD risk, these effects were eliminated
after control for cardiometabolic risk
factors.
Clinical guidelines for the assessment
and/or management of obesity in the U.S.
(14) and Canada (15) recommend that
measurement of WC be used to identify
the need for further assessment including
measurement of cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors. The recent consensus statement of
the ADA, the Obesity Society, and the
American Society for Nutrition questions
the sequence of these clinical measures
and, more importantly, the relevance of
WC measurement in clinical practice (7).
Our finding that WC predicts the risk of
diabetes beyond that explained by cardio-
metabolic risk factors and BMI extends
previous observations that document an
approximately fivefold greater risk of di-
abetes in the highest relative to the lowest
category of WC in multivariate analysis
controlling for lifestyle factors and BMI
(3,4). Combined with the fact that the
sex-specific WC cut points used in the
current study approximate those advo-
cated in the guidelines (102 and 88 cm
in men and women, respectively), these
observations reinforce the utility of WC as
a first step in the identification of the
high-risk, abdominally obese patient. In-
deed, although an elevated WC per se
alerts the clinician to the need for further
clinical assessment, we (16) and others
(17) have shown that only patients with
an elevated WC in combination with ele-
vations in one or more cardiometabolic
risk factors represent those who are at
substantially increased health risk and
thus require aggressive treatment.
The mechanistic link that explains the
association between WC and diabetes risk
independent of cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors and BMI is unclear and remains the
focus of ongoing investigation (18). Al-
though the portal theory originally pro-
posed a substrate-driven mechanism
(19), recent evidence suggests that the
pathophysiology of abdominal adiposity
may result from the augmented secretion
of various prothrombotic and proinflam-
matory cytokines from an expanded ab-
dominal fat depot (20).
Although WC was associated with
CVD, such that individuals with a high
WC were 73% more likely to have CVD
than those with a low WC, the association
did not remain significant after control for
the cardiometabolic risk factors. This
finding was not unexpected given that
WC is a strong correlate of dyslipidemia,
hypertension, and the metabolic syn-
drome (21), themselves established ante-
cedents for CVD. Accordingly, this
finding does not indicate that a high WC
is not a risk factor for CVD but, rather,
that WC predicts CVD via its influence on
cardiometabolic risk factors. Indeed, the
utility of WC to predict CVD risk will al-
ways be attenuated when metabolic risk
factors that lie in the causal pathway be-
tween WC and risk of CVD are included
in the prediction model. This observation
agrees with the findings of the INTER-
HEART study, wherein the strong associ-
ation between WC and myocardial
infarction was substantially attenuated af-
ter control for hypertension and the apo-
lipoprotein B­to­A ratio (1).
From a clinical perspective, it is note-
worthy that in addition to the utility of
WC measurement to identify the high-
risk, abdominally obese patient, WC is
the single best anthropometric measure
for detecting changes in abdominal obe-
sity in response to treatment. It has re-
Figure 1--ORs for diabetes (A) and CVD (B) according to WC  metabolic risk factor groups.
Both WC and metabolic risk factor groups were independent predictors of diabetes (Ptrend

0.001). The metabolic risk factor groups were independent predictors of CVD (Ptrend
 0.001),
whereas the WC groups were not (Ptrend
 0.415). Mod, moderate.

peatedly been demonstrated that
although WC is reduced consequent to
weight loss, WC can also be reduced in
response to treatment in obese individu-
als who are resistant to weight loss or
changes in BMI (22). The implication is
that when considering the efficacy of
treatment strategies designed to manage
abdominal obesity, practitioners are en-
couraged to look beyond body weight as
the measure of benefit and measure WC.
The analyses presented here are based
on a large and representative dataset and
are therefore generalizable to the U.S.
adult population. However, the cross-
sectional nature of this study precludes
definitive causal inferences about the as-
sociation between WC and BMI with dia-
betes and CVD. Numerous studies,
however, have shown that high WC and
BMI precede the onset of morbidity (1­4)
and mortality (5). The assessment of CVD
presence in the current study relied on
participant recall of previous diagnosis
and thus may have been a source of error.
Additionally, as our assessment of diabe-
tes was based on fasting plasma glucose
values, a limited number of new diabetes
cases may have been misclassified as non-
diabetes. Lastly, due to the limited sample
size, we were not able to perform ethnic-
ity- and/or sex-specific analyses.
The demonstration that WC predicts
risk of diabetes beyond that explained by
cardiometabolic risk factors routinely ac-
quired in clinical practice responds to
prior criticism (7) and lends critical sup-
port for the recommendation that WC be
a routine measure for identification and
management of the high-risk, abdomi-
nally obese patient (14,15). Indeed, com-
bined with the observation that WC is
associated with changes in abdominal
obesity in response to treatment with or
without weight loss (22), it is difficult to
imagine a cogent argument against inclu-
sion of WC in clinical practice.
