Abstract: The current study explores whether: (a) nutritional factors among adolescent males
predict their risk of exhibiting verbal deficits and psychopathic traits during adulthood and (b)
the link between nutritional factors and these outcomes is conditioned by the MAOA genotype.
The study analyzes data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health), a nationally representative, genetically informative sample. We find evidence that meal
deprivation increases the likelihood of both verbal deficits and psychopathic personality traits,
whereas poor quality nutrition increases the risk of verbal deficits. We detect the presence of a
number of gene-environment interactions between measures of food quality and MAOA genotype,
but no evidence of GxE in the case of meal deprivation. Limitations are noted and avenues for future
research are discussed.

1. Introduction
Adequate nutrition is an essential component of healthy brain development [1]. Protein, iron,
folate, essential fatty acids, and other key vitamins and minerals optimize the functioning of
several brain areas, especially during the prenatal and early postnatal periods. Conversely, foods
high in saturated fats have been shown to increase the risk of neuropsychological deficiencies by
interfering with molecular substrates that aid numerous cognitive functions [2]. Ultimately, poor
nutrition has the potential to impair learning/memory [3,4], reduce verbal ability [5­7], diminish
executive functions [8,9], and interfere with modulators of synaptic plasticity, such as brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [2,10]. Inadequate nutrition may also increase the risk of antisocial traits
and behaviors. For instance, research has shown that poor nutrition during the early stages of the
life course increases the likelihood of various criminogenic traits and behaviors during childhood
and adolescence, including ADHD [11], externalizing behaviors [12,13], and aggressive/delinquent
behaviors [14]. Psychopathic individuals, moreover, tend to exhibit brain deficits [15] that are often
directly or indirectly influenced by the adequacy and quality of nutrition [4].
Although several studies have suggested that certain dimensions of nutrition influence both
cognitive and behavioral outcomes, much of this work has been limited to childhood nutrition [3,7,9].
The tendency to emphasize childhood nutrition is understandable, given the substantial plasticity of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12, 15739­15755; doi:10.3390/ijerph121215017 www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12, 15739­15755
the brain during this stage of the life course. Recent research, however, has shown that nutritional
factors (e.g., fatty acids) during adolescence and adulthood can impact subsequent executive
functioning [16,17], verbal ability [16,18,19], mood [20,21], and behavior [20,22]. It is also possible
that the relationship between poor nutrition and neuropsychological and mental health outcomes
may be moderated by genetic factors. Nevertheless, empirical tests of this possibility are generally
lacking (except see [23,24]), despite a wealth of research indicating that gene-nutrient interactions
influence the development of various physical ailments, including cancer and obesity [25].
In light of these voids in the literature, the goal of the present study is twofold. First, we
test whether indicators of poor and inadequate nutrition during adolescence significantly increase
the likelihood of two correlated outcomes during adulthood: verbal deficits and psychopathic
personality traits [26,27]. Our second objective is to examine whether the link between
nutritional factors, verbal deficits, and psychopathic personality traits is moderated by a functional
polymorphism in the promoter region of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, a polymorphism
that has been linked to a host of antisocial outcomes [28,29].
1.1. Poor Nutrition, Verbal Deficits, and Psychopathic Personality Traits
A large body of research indicates that nutrition plays an important role in key brain
functions [3,4,6,9,12,16]. Many of these studies have detected significant associations between
nutritional factors and various components of verbal intelligence [6,19,30], including verbal
fluency [3,5,7], word recall [31], and receptive vocabulary [32,33]. Furthermore, it appears that both
diet quality [6,19,30] and severe malnutrition [5,7] can influence verbal ability across multiple stages
of the life course. For example, using a sample of 1269 Chinese children, Liu and colleagues [30] found
that children who regularly consumed breakfast scored higher on tests of verbal intelligence during
the kindergarten school year. Similarly, a study by Gale and colleagues [6] revealed that children who
regularly eat healthy foods, including fruit, vegetables, and home-cooked meals, exhibited higher
verbal IQ scores at age 4 than children who infrequently ate healthy foods.
Some studies have also suggested that the benefits of a nutritious diet on verbal skills may
not be limited to childhood. For instance, a recent study by Waber and colleagues [7] examined a
sample of middle-aged, Barbadian adults and found that those who experienced moderate to severe
malnutrition during infancy scored significantly lower on verbal fluency and associated cognitive
tests, implying that the neuropsychological risk incurred through the experience of early nutritional
deficits may persist for decades. Other research has revealed that a poor quality diet during the
adolescent years is predictive of reduced verbal intelligence through early adulthood, even when
genetic factors are taken into account [19]. Finally, research suggests that higher consumption of fatty
fish during late adulthood enhances various aspects of verbal memory, including word recall [31].
Thus, the literature to date tends to detect a significant relationship between nutritional factors and
various indicators of verbal ability.
Although very few studies have examined the link between poor nutrition and psychopathic
personality traits (except see [34]), a number of studies have indicated that poor nutrition is
significantly associated with a variety of mental health problems, including depression [35],
psychosomatic complaints [14], schizophrenia [35], and schizotypal personality disorder [36]. Despite
the paucity of research linking nutrition to specific dimensions of psychopathy, some research has
shown that certain personality traits associated with psychopathy, including disinhibition, hostility,
and aloofness, can be linked to diet quality [37].
A number of studies have also linked nutritional factors to an important correlate of
psychopathic personality traits: violence [38]. Several researchers have randomly assigned study
participants to receive micronutrient supplements to see whether doing so reduces violence and other
problematic behaviors [20,39]. Results have generally been supportive of the link between ingesting
supplements intended to mimic a well-balanced diet, reductions in violent and delinquent behaviors,
and overall improvements in behavioral control. To illustrate, a study by Schoenthaler and Bier [39]
15740
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12, 15739­15755
found that, relative to controls, children whose diet was supplemented with key micronutrients (e.g.,
calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C) exhibited a 47% reduction in the rate of antisocial behaviors.
Non-experimental studies have also indicated that consuming inadequate and poor quality food
can heighten the risk of various behavioral problems during childhood and adolescence [12,13].
In light of this body of research, it is reasonable to suggest that nutritional factors might influence the
development of psychopathic personality traits by early adulthood, particularly since verbal deficits
and psychopathic personality traits are significantly correlated.
1.2. MAOA Genotype, Verbal Deficits, and Psychopathic Personality Traits
Genetic factors also appear to play an important role in the development of both verbal
deficits and psychopathic personality traits [40­42]. For instance, a handful of studies have
detected significant associations between the X-linked gene known as MAOA and diminished
verbal ability [43­45]. In particular, males who possess a low-activity allele (i.e., a 2 or 3-repeat
allele) on MAOA are more likely to evince greater deficits in verbal and social communication
skills [43­45], particularly among males who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders.
Additional research has found that MAOA interacts with other polymorphisms (e.g., COMT) to
predict verbal intelligence among males with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [41]. Males who
carry a low activity allele are also at greater risk of exhibiting aggression and violence relative to other
genotypes [28,29].
Not surprisingly, MAOA genotype has also been linked to personality traits associated with
psychopathy [42,46]. For example, Williams and colleagues [42] found that males with a low
activity allele scored significantly higher on an index of various psychopathic personality traits (e.g.,
callousness, grandiose sense of self, pathological lying, disinhibition) relative to their high-activity
MAOA counterparts. A study by Fowler and colleagues [46] garnered similar results using a sample
of adolescents with a history of ADHD. The results of their study indicated that allelic variation on
MAOA was significantly associated with total psychopathy scores as well as "emotional dysfunction"
psychopathy scores (i.e., callousness or lack of emotional responsiveness) in this high-risk sample.
Research to date, therefore, suggests that allelic variation on MAOA is significantly predictive of
neurological, behavioral, and personality differences in males, with carriers of a low-activity allele
being particularly prone to negative outcomes [42,46,47].
1.3. Are The Effects of Poor Nutrition on Verbal Deficits and Psychopathic Traits Conditional?
While studies have detected significant associations between inadequate nutrition, verbal
deficits and poor mental health outcomes, a few studies have also suggested that the strength of such
associations may be contingent on other factors, such as sex [48] and parenting style [49]. Even so,
very few moderators of the link between nutrition, verbal deficits, and mental health outcomes have
been examined. For example, research has almost entirely ignored the possibility that genetic factors
could moderate the relationship between nutrition, verbal deficits, and mental health. The few
studies that have done so have typically examined neurological disorders associated with elderly
populations (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), rather than young adult populations [23,24]. Still, these
studies suggest that the influence of nutrition on neurological health is likely contingent on allelic
variation on important genetic markers.
Gene-nutrient interactions would be expected to influence neuropsychological and
psychological outcomes, since essential nutrients as well as several candidate genes (e.g., MAOA,
DRD2) often have overlapping influences on the synthesis of neurotransmitters in key brain
structures. For example, both tryptophan, a dietary precursor to serotonin, as well as 5HHTLPR
influence aggression/impulsivity by altering serotonergic functioning [50,51]. Georgieff [1],
moreover, explains how a diet deficient in iron can alter monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis,
which, at a genetic level, is also regulated by allelic variation on several genes [52]. The degree to
which an individual's neuropsychological or behavioral profile is substantially altered by patterns of
15741
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12, 15739­15755
nutritional input may therefore depend on their genotype, particularly on polymorphisms that have
been linked to neuropsychological and behavioral abnormalities, such as MAOA.
1.4. The Current Study
In this study, we explore the possibility that the influence of poor nutrition on verbal deficits
and psychopathic personality traits among males is conditioned by allelic variation on MAOA.
Research has suggested that the effects of MAOA on negative outcomes are moderated by exposure
to various noxious environments, including maltreatment [29] and maternal stress in utero [53].
Furthermore, a recent animal experiment [52] suggested that low activity MAOA genotype interacts
with exposure to low levels of dietary iron in the womb to predict poorer cognitive functioning
and maladaptive social behaviors (including aggressive temperament) in offspring. Still, whether
the MAOA interacts with nutritional factors to predict verbal abilities and psychopathic personality
traits among a human sample remains unknown. The present study extends this line of research
and utilizes a large sample of youth to examine the direct and interactive effects of adolescent
nutritional deficiencies and MAOA genotype on verbal deficits and psychopathic personality traits
during adulthood.
2. Method
2.1. Sample
Subjects come from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).
The Add Health is a prospective, nationally representative study that covers 14­15 years of
development across adolescence and adulthood, making it well-suited to our research question.
Furthermore, the Add Health also includes a number of participants (approx. 2500) who were asked
to provide samples of their DNA for genotyping at the third wave of data collection. To be precise,
buccal swabs were obtained for each of these participants so that their genetic profile on various
candidate genes (e.g., DRD2, DRD4) could be determined [54].
In the case of MAOA, which is an X-linked gene, females have two copies of the gene, whereas
males only have one copy. Therefore, interactions between MAOA and other risk factors must be
examined separately for males and females, due to the distinct genetic profile of males and females on
this gene. Much of the research on MAOA to date has linked low activity alleles to various antisocial
and criminogenic outcomes in males [29,55]. As a result, we follow the lead of prior research using
the Add Health [55] and restrict our sample to genotyped males (N = 1357).
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Outcome Measures
Verbal Deficits. Verbal deficits were measured using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT).
The PPVT involves an examiner showing various pages of pictures to the participant, with each page
containing four distinct pictures. The examiner then speaks a word that describes one of the pictures
presented and asks the subject to identify the picture that corresponds to the spoken word. The PPVT
has been found to be a reliable and valid measure of verbal intelligence [56] that highly correlates
with other indicators of cognitive ability [57]. For the purposes of our study, we utilized the PPVT
percentile scores obtained at wave 3 (early adulthood). Furthermore, in order to create a measure
of deficits in verbal ability, the original PPVT percentile scores were recoded so that a higher score
reflects relatively poor verbal ability. Table 1 includes the descriptive statistics of the verbal deficits
measure as well as all other variables and scales included in the analysis.

Psychopathic Personality Traits. At wave 4, respondents were asked a number of questions
that tapped their overall temperament and personality. Following the lead of prior research [58],
we employed several of these items, taken from the five factor model of personality, to tap
important dimensions of psychopathy, including lack of sociability, narcissism, low self-control,
and callous/unemotional traits. We constructed a scale of psychopathic personality traits
by standardizing and summing 23 relevant items from this personality inventory ( = 0.83).
Items included questions about the degree to which participants lose their temper, have frequent
mood swings, have little empathy/sympathy for others, rely on their impulses, and enjoy taking
risks. Scores on each of the items ranged from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree).
Ultimately, all of the items included in the index were coded so that higher scores on the index
reflected a more pronounced tendency toward psychopathic personality traits.
2.2.2. Nutrition and Genetic Measures
Meal Deprivation. Elements of nutrition that can impact neuropsychological and mental health
outcomes include both the sufficiency of food [59] and the quality/combination of foods [2]. For our
first measure, we created an item that taps the extent to which subjects were failing to eat regular
meals during adolescence. At the second wave of data collection, subjects were asked three questions
regarding how frequently they ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner during the past week, with response
options ranging from 0 (zero days during the past week) to 7 (seven days during the past week) for
each of the three items. Scores on each item were reverse coded so that higher scores reflected less
frequent consumption of each meal during the previous week. The reverse-coded scores on each of
the three items were subsequently summed and divided by the total number of possible meals during
the previous week (i.e., 21). Consequently, the meal deprivation item represents the proportion of total
meals during the previous week that were skipped, with scores closer to 1 indicating greater meal
deprivation. We should note that, while the concept of meal deprivation is similar to the concept
of food insufficiency, they are not interchangeable. For instance, studies examining malnourished
children define food insufficiency as "an inadequate amount of food intake due to a lack of money
or resources" [59]. The current measure of meal deprivation, however, cannot definitively determine
the reason underlying the infrequent eating of regular meals (i.e., whether it was elective or not).
Nonetheless, our measure is an improvement in terms of specificity of change in food intake, as it
captures gradual decreases in regular meal consumption. Prior research on children has generally
15743
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12, 15739­15755
classified food insufficient households as those that "sometimes or often do not get enough food to
eat" [59], which cannot capture the possibility of a dose-response relationship.
Low Vegetable Consumption. In addition to our measure of meal deprivation, we included two
measures of food quality: low vegetable consumption and high fast food consumption. During wave
1 of data collection, respondents were asked a small number of questions regarding their eating
habits. We followed the lead of prior research [60] and utilized a question about the number of
times the youth ate vegetables during the day prior to the interview. Response options ranged from
0 (did not eat) to 2 (ate twice or more). In order for our item to reflect low vegetable consumption,
this item was reverse-coded so that subjects who reported eating vegetables less frequently received
higher scores.
High Fast Food Consumption. A high frequency of fast food consumption has been linked to poorer
mental and physical health outcomes [61], and thus may be predictive of the outcomes in our study.
For our second measure of food quality, we followed the lead of prior research [62] and employed an
item from the second wave of data collection that asked about the frequency with which adolescents
ate fast food during the previous week. Examples of fast food were given during the interview,
such as McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, in order to avoid misclassification. Response
options for this item ranged from 0 (zero days during the previous week) to 7 (every day during the
previous week).
Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). As mentioned previously, genetic information on a number of
polymorphisms was obtained for approximately 2500 subjects at the third wave of data collection.
An X-linked gene known as MAOA was one of the polymorphisms examined in the genotyped
subsample of the Add Health study. Previous research has linked this gene to various indicators
of maladjustment in males, including impulsivity [47], violence [29], and gang involvement [28].
Specifically, males who possess low activity alleles (i.e., the 2 or 3 repeat allele) incur a greater risk of
developing these negative traits and behaviors. In light of this body of research, and in line with prior
research using the Add Health [28], MAOA was coded so that males possessing the 2 or 3 repeat allele
were assigned a value of 1, whereas males possessing higher repeat alleles (i.e., the 3.5-repeat allele,
the 4-repeat allele, or the 5-repeat allele) were assigned a value of 0. As displayed in Table 1, roughly
43% of the sample possessed a low activity allele, whereas the remainder of the sample possessed a
high activity allele.
2.3. Adolescent Traits
Low Self-Control. At the first wave of data collection, participants were asked a number
of questions tapping their tendency toward impulsivity. An impulsive temperament is more
likely in individuals with poor nutrition [63], and has also been found to be closely tied to both
neuropsychological deficits [64] and psychopathic traits [65]. At wave 1, adolescents were asked a
number of questions regarding their level of self-control, including whether they go with their gut
feeling when making a decision, think about the consequences of their decision, gather ample facts
in order to solve a problem, try to think of alternative solutions to a problem, and analyze what went
right or wrong after taking a particular course of action. The five items were coded so that higher
scores reflect lower levels of self-control. An index was then created by standardizing and summing
the recoded items ( = 0.66). Importantly, our measure of low self-control is informed by Hirschi's [66]
recent conceptualization of low self-control, which he describes as "the tendency to consider the full
range of potential costs [and long-term implications] of a particular act". Furthermore, the items
included in our scale also reflect the recent findings that suggest a close nexus between executive
dysfunction, poor decision making, and low self-control [67].
2.4. Family Socialization, Home Environment and Neighborhood Measures
Family Meals. A number of studies have suggested that the frequency of family meals has a
significant influence on adolescent nutrition [68]. It is possible, moreover, that the structure provided
15744
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12, 15739­15755
by family meals may influence adolescent criminogenic outcomes as well [69]. As a result, we
include a measure that taps the frequency of family meals in our study. At wave 1 of data collection,
adolescents were asked how many days during the past week they ate at least one of their meals with
their parent/parents. Response categories ranged from 0 (no days during the past week) to 7 (every
day during the past week).
TV Viewing. We also included a measure of TV viewing, as high levels of TV viewing have been
associated with poorer diet [70] as well as antisocial traits and behaviors [71]. At the first wave of
data collection, youth were asked to estimate how many hours a week they spent watching television.
Although nine participants reported more than 80 h of television a week, these subjects were coded
as 80 ha week to maintain a more reasonable range of values (80 h a week would require an average
of more than 11 hours a day of TV viewing).
Video Games. In addition to television viewing, a measurement of the frequency of video game
participation was included. Recent research has shown that playing video games, along with other
sedentary behaviors, is associated with a poorer diet [72]. Some research has also suggested that
frequent video game participation is associated with antisocial tendencies [73]. Consequently, we
include a measure of video game participation in our study which taps the number of hours spent
playing video games in the past week. Scores on this item range from 0 to 60, with higher numbers
reflecting greater exposure to video games.
Neighborhood Disadvantage. We also create a measure of neighborhood disadvantage using six
items [74]. At wave 1, youths were asked whether they were happy in their neighborhood, whether
they knew most of their neighbors, whether they felt safe in their neighborhood and whether they
wanted to move. Items were recoded to reflect greater displeasure with (and concern about) the
neighborhood. Subsequently, items were standardized and summed to construct the index ( = 0.66).
Low Maternal Attachment. We also followed the lead of prior research [75] and constructed an
index of maternal attachment at wave 1. Respondents were asked how close they felt to their mother
and how much they thought their mother cared about them, with responses ranging from 1 (not very
close/much) to 5 (very close/much). Items were coded so that higher scores were indicative of lower
maternal attachment. The index was created by standardizing and summing the items ( = 0.67).
Maternal Disengagement. In line with prior research [74], we created an index designed to tap
the extent to which the subject's mother was disconnected from her child's life. At wave 1, youth
were asked whether they were satisfied with their relationship with their mother and with the way
she communicates with them, whether their mother is warm or loving toward them, and whether
she calmly corrects their mistakes and misbehaviors. Responses to the items were standardized and
added together to create an index in which higher scores indicate more maternal disengagement
( = 0.79).
Low Maternal Involvement. We also developed an item assessing low maternal involvement.
At wave 1, adolescents were asked if they had engaged in a number of activities with their
mother during the past four weeks, including playing a sport, attending church, shopping, going
to a movie or special event, and talking about school or a personal problem. Adolescents who
reported participating in none of the activities with their mother were assigned a value of 1, whereas
adolescents who reported participating in at least one of these activities with their mother were
assigned a value of 0.
Low Maternal Supervision. Finally, a measure of maternal supervision was created by using
three items provided at wave 1 [76]. Participants were asked if their mother is typically home
when they leave for school in the morning, arrive home from school, and go to bed. Subjects who
responded "almost never" or "never" were assigned a value of 1 on each of the three variables;
otherwise, they were coded as a 0. The recoded items were then added together so that subjects
whose mothers provided the lowest amount of supervision scored the highest on this variable (final
range of responses: 0­3).
15745
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12, 15739­15755
2.5. Controls
Age. We also included a continuous variable in the analysis measuring the age of each respondent
(in years) at wave 1.
Race. A measure of race (1 = nonwhite; 0 = white) was also included in the analysis in an attempt
to rule out any confounding due to racial differences of the subjects.
Low SES. Low SES was measured using four items that asked caregivers about the whether
they had received various forms of financial assistance at wave 1 [76]. To be precise, caregivers
reported whether they had received food stamps, unemployment compensation, Aid to Families with
Dependent Children, or public housing/housing subsidy within the month prior to data collection.
Caregivers who reported having received any assistance within the previous month were assigned a
value of 1, whereas caregivers who reported receiving no assistance were assigned a value of 0.
2.6. Plan of Analysis
Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is used to test our hypotheses. Because our final sample
included sibling pairs, standard errors may be deflated due to case non-independence. We followed
the lead of prior research [77] and estimated Huber/White standard errors to account for the
clustering of cases by family. Our analysis proceeds as follows. First, we examine whether indicators
of poor food quality and meal deprivation during adolescence were significantly predictive of verbal
deficits during early adulthood, net of controls. Second, we test whether these same indicators of poor
nutrition are predictive of psychopathic personality traits during adulthood. Most importantly, we
estimate six regression equations exploring whether statistical interactions between MAOA genotype
and our three indicators of poor nutrition (i.e., meal deprivation, low vegetable consumption,
high fast food consumption) are predictive of verbal deficits and psychopathic personality traits
among males. Moderating effects were examined using multiplicative interaction terms between
the nutritional factors and MAOA. Covariates were mean-centered prior to creating the interaction
terms [78].
3. Results
Tables 2 and 3 display the results of eight regression equations that estimate a) whether poorer
nutrition during adolescence significantly increases the likelihood of verbal deficits and psychopathic
personality traits during adulthood and b) whether MAOA moderates the association between
indicators of poor nutrition and these outcomes.

To be precise, the first model of each table examines direct effects, whereas models 2 through 4
of each table explore gene-environment interactions between elements of poor nutrition and MAOA.
The results of the direct effect models indicate that subjects who frequently skipped meals during
their adolescent years were significantly more likely to exhibit poorer verbal ability during early
adulthood and psychopathic traits during adulthood, net of family, neighborhood, and demographic
factors. We should note that, although meal deprivation significantly predicted both of these
outcomes, the effect of meal deprivation on psychopathic personality traits was particularly sizeable
( = 0.17, the largest beta in the model). Nevertheless, despite the relevance of meal deprivation to
the development of psychopathic personality traits, indicators of poor food quality had no significant
direct influence on such traits. In the case of verbal deficits, however, food quality appeared to be
more relevant. Specifically, low vegetable consumption during adolescence significantly increased
the likelihood of verbal deficits during early adulthood ( = 0.16), although the effects of fast
food consumption were null. The significant effect of low vegetable consumption is all the more
noteworthy considering that none of the neighborhood or family socialization measures emerged
as significant predictors of verbal deficits (see Model 1 of Table 2). We now turn to the results of
our interactive models. Models 2 through 4 of Table 2 contain the results of 3 regression equations
15747
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12, 15739­15755
that examined whether each nutritional measure (i.e., meal deprivation, low vegetable consumption,
and high fast food consumption) interacted with the low-activity MAOA genotype to predict verbal
deficits during early adulthood. Two of the three interactions emerged as positive and significant.
In particular, the results suggest that subjects who consumed fewer vegetables and more fast food
during their adolescent years were especially likely to exhibit verbal deficits during early adulthood
if they also possessed a activity MAOA genotype (see Figures 1 and 2). No significant interactions
between meal deprivation and MAOA emerged, however, in the prediction of verbal deficits.

the findings reiterate the relevance of food quality for the neuropsychological and mental health of males
with a high-risk genotype on MAOA. Specifically, the significant, positive interaction shown in Model 4
of Table 3 indicates that participants who consumed a greater amount of fast food during their youth
were at significantly higher risk of developing psychopathic personality traits by adulthood, but only if
they possessed a high-risk allele on MAOA (see Figure 3;  = 0.15). Neither MAOA nor fast food
consumption had significant, independent effects on psychopathic traits, but when examined
interactively, they add to the predictive value of the model (R2 increased 25% with the inclusion of the
interaction term). Allelic variation on MAOA, however, did not moderate the relationship between meal

4. Discussion
Inadequate nutrition has been shown to predict a host of negative life outcomes, whether physical [25],
psychological [35,36], or neuropsychological [3,4]. Empirical examinations of the role of dietary choices
during adolescence in predicting neuropsychological and mental health outcomes during adulthood,
however, are lacking in comparison to studies on childhood nutrition (except see [79]). Furthermore,
research on neuropsychological and mental health outcomes often fails to explore how the influence of
nutritional factors might vary as a function of allelic variation on key genetic markers
(e.g., MAOA) (except see [23,24]). The primary aim of the present study was to address these gaps in
the literature by testing whether features of adolescent nutrition are significant predictors of verbal
deficits and psychopathic personality traits during early adulthood, and whether these relationships
might be moderated by MAOA. Analysis of the Add Health data revealed three key findings.
First, the results revealed that both meal deprivation and low vegetable consumption during
adolescence significantly increased the likelihood of verbal deficits during adulthood, whereas only meal
deprivation significantly increased the likelihood of psychopathic personality traits. The findings are
generally consistent with the research to date on the potentially deleterious effects of poor nutrition on
neuropsychological functioning, even during later life stages [16]. However, the absence of any significant
direct effect of poor food quality on psychopathic personality traits is somewhat unexpected considering diet
quality has been linked to both violence [20] and negative mental health outcomes [35,36]. Still, our results,
as a whole, highlight the role of both inadequate and poor quality nutrition in subsequent
neuropsychological and psychological functioning.
Second, we found evidence that a poor quality diet during adolescence is especially detrimental to
the adult verbal ability of individuals who possess a low activity allele on MAOA. To be precise, subjects

Second, we found evidence that a poor quality diet during adolescence is especially detrimental
to the adult verbal ability of individuals who possess a low activity allele on MAOA. To be
precise, subjects who reported eating vegetables less frequently and fast food more frequently were
particularly prone to verbal deficits in early adulthood if they carried the 2 or 3 repeat allele on
MAOA. This finding speaks to the potential relevance of genetic factors in moderating the effects
of poor quality nutrition on neuropsychological outcomes [52]. Our third and final finding is similar
to the second. We found that psychopathic personality traits were significantly more likely among
adult subjects who ate fast food more frequently during their youth, but only if they also possessed a
low activity MAOA allele. The effect of high fast food consumption on subsequent psychopathic
15750

personality traits, therefore, only emerged once genotyped was considered and included as a
moderator in the study.
5. Conclusions
While our study makes an important contribution to the literature, it is not without its
limitations. First, it would have been useful to also test hypotheses using measures that tap specific
nutrients (e.g., omega 3 fatty acids, iron), but such measures were not available in the data. Some of
the recent literature utilizes very precise measures of nutrient intake and metabolization, such as
omega 3 blood levels [34] and iron deficiency in utero [52]. Nevertheless, more generalized measures
of poor diet are useful in highlighting the specific dietary changes that can be made on a daily basis to
improve subsequent neuropsychological and mental health [6,9,19]. On a related note, it would have
been preferable to have a greater number of diet items and more thorough measurements of diet
(e.g., food journals/records). Second, a wider array of neuropsychological tests and diagnostic tools
(e.g., fMRI) would have been preferable to test the robustness of our results. We were only able to
measure impaired verbal ability and thus cannot directly assess the relevance of the results for other
cognitive functions. Still, our verbal deficits models likely yield conservative tests of the influence
of nutrition on neuropsychological functions, as other brain regions that are less relevant to verbal
ability specifically may also be impacted by poor nutrition. Finally, the generalizability of our study
is restricted due to the inclusion of a number of sibling pairs in our final sample. Nevertheless, recent
research suggests that the findings of studies that examine samples of sibling pairs may be more
generalizable to the broader non-sibling population than originally assumed [80].
In conclusion, poor dietary habits during youth appear to place individuals at risk of both
verbal deficits and psychopathic personality traits during adulthood, particularly for those with a
high-risk genotype on MAOA. Future research should seek to replicate and build upon the findings
of our study by employing additional samples, more diversified and more thorough measures of
nutrition, a broader array of candidate genes, and other measures of neuropsychological functioning.
Additionally, research in this area should explore the relevance of nutrient-gene interactions in
the prediction of outcomes associated with verbal deficits and/or psychopathic personality traits,
including violence, offending, and criminal justice involvement. Doing so will elucidate ways in
which families, school administrators, and other practitioners can intervene in order to improve the
life outcomes of at-risk youth.
