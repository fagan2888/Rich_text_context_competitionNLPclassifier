Abstract
Background: Few studies compare sports injury patterns in different settings. This study described the epidemiology
of soccer injuries presenting to emergency departments (EDs) and compared injuries presenting to EDs to injuries
presenting to collegiate and high school athletic trainers (ATs).
Methods: Soccer-related injuries (product code 1267) in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) that
were sustained by individuals at least two years of age in 2004­2013 were included. High School Reporting Information
Online (HS RIO) data for high school soccer injuries during the 2005/06­2013/14 academic years were compared to NEISS
data for those aged 14­17 years in 2005­2013. National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program
(NCAA-ISP) data for collegiate soccer injuries during the 2009/10­2013/14 academic years were compared to NEISS data
for those aged 18­22 years in 2009­2013. All datasets included weights to calculate national estimates. Injury proportion
ratios (IPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) compared nationally estimated injury distributions between the HS RIO/
NCAA-ISP and NEISS data subsets.
Results: During the study period, 63,258 soccer-related injuries were captured by NEISS, which translates to an estimated
2,039,250 injuries seen at US EDs nationwide. Commonly injured body parts included the head/face (19.1%), ankle (17.6%),
hand/wrist (15.3%), and knee (12.2%). Common diagnoses included sprains/strains (34.0%), fractures (22.2%), and contusions
(17.7%). Compared to their respective age ranges in NEISS, sprains/strains comprised a larger proportion of injuries in HS
RIO (48.3% vs. 33.7%; IPR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.42) and NCAA-ISP (51.3% vs. 37.0%; IPR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.46). In contrast,
fractures comprised a smaller proportion of injuries in HS RIO than in NEISS (7.5% vs. 18.6%; IPR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.47)
and NCAA-ISP (2.8% vs. 15.7%; IPR = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.22).
Conclusions: ATs more commonly reported injuries that are easily diagnosed and treated (e.g., sprains/strains); EDs more
commonly reported injuries with longer recovery times and rehabilitation (e.g., fractures). Although ED surveillance data can
identify the most severe sports-related injuries, high school and college sports surveillance may better describe the breadth
of sports-related injuries. Our findings may provide further support for school-based sports medicine professionals, but
further research is needed to comprehensively examine the potential economic and health-related benefits.

Background
Soccer is one of the most popular sports worldwide, with
an estimated 265 million participants in 2006. Although
the popularity of soccer is perceived to be larger outside
of the United States (US), estimates of participation in the
US are high, ranging from 17.6 to 24.5 million (Kunz
2007; Sports and Fitness Industry Association 2013).
Soccer is a popular high school and collegiate sport in the
US. During the 2013/14 academic year, the National
Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) re-
ported 417,419 boys and 374,564 girls played high school
soccer and the National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) reported 23,602 males and 26,358 females played
collegiate soccer (National Federation of High Schools
2013; National Collegiate Athletic Association 1981).
Like all sports and recreational activities, although
playing soccer provides several positive health benefits,
it also poses a risk of injury. With such large numbers of
participants, the injury risk associated with playing soc-
cer poses a public health concern. Previously published
works by US researchers evaluating population-based
data on soccer-related injuries have been mostly limited
to youth populations or are over a decade old (Adams &
Schiff 2006; Leininger et al. 2007; Finch et al. 1998; Kelly
et al. 2001; Walters et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2016). An
examination of the epidemiology of soccer injuries
across the lifespan using more recent data from varied
clinical settings should help drive the development of
age-appropriate interventions to reduce the incidence
and severity of injury.
One intervention that may assist in mitigating the se-
verity of injury is presence of a sports medicine clinician
such as a physician or athletic trainer (AT). Although
the presence of an onsite sports medicine professional
has long been advocated, coverage at soccer activities
varies by level of play (American Medical Association
1998; Fletcher et al. 2014; Kerr et al. 2014a). The NCAA
Sports Medicine Handbook advocates for all member in-
stitutions to provide appropriate AT coverage across all
sports and divisions (National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation 2014). ATs are not required at the high school
level and data suggest that even though 70% of high
schools have access to some form of AT coverage, only
55% of student-athletes have access to a full-time AT
(Pryor et al. 2015). Having ATs available onsite: allows
participants to have injuries immediately diagnosed,
treated, and managed; mitigates resulting injury sever-
ity; and reduces the need to present to emergency
departments (EDs) or other healthcare facilities with
higher associated costs (Wham et al. 2008; 2010).
Thus, it should be expected that soccer injuries pre-
senting for treatment to ATs in the collegiate or high
school setting will differ from injuries presenting for
treatment in the ED setting.
To our knowledge, to date there have been no exami-
nations of soccer-related injuries presenting to different
clinical settings across the high school and collegiate age
span. One study compared the epidemiology of
basketball-related injuries presenting to EDs to those
reported by ATs in a high school setting (Fletcher et al.
2014), finding that EDs reported larger proportions of
severe injuries such as fractures than high schools. How-
ever, the study did not consider additional levels of com-
petition. This study builds on the findings of prior
studies by examining the epidemiology of soccer-related
injuries across the lifespan. First, we examined soccer-
related injuries seen at US EDs from 2004 to 2013 to
identify epidemiologic trends and to develop targeted
recommendations to reduce risk of injury. Second, the
ED injury surveillance data from high school- and
college-aged individuals was respectively compared to
injury surveillance data originating from the National
High School Reporting Information Online (HS RIO)
and the National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA) Injury Surveillance Program (ISP). The two ob-
jectives of this study were to 1) describe the epidemi-
ology of soccer injuries across the age span presenting to
EDs and 2) compare the epidemiology of soccer injuries
presenting to the ED to soccer injuries presenting to
collegiate and high school ATs.
Methods
Data sources
In this study, soccer injury data from three large national
surveillance systems were evaluated. This study is ex-
empt from human subjects review as it uses previously
collected data that were de-identified.
National electronic injury surveillance system
ED data were obtained from the US Consumer Product
Safety Commission's (CPSC) National Electronic Injury
Surveillance System (NEISS), which has been previously
described in detail (US Consumer Product Safety
Commission 2017). The NEISS data originates from a
stratified probability sample of approximately 100 US
hospitals with at least six beds and a 24-h ED. ED re-
cords that were completed by various ED staff members
were reviewed daily with demographic, injury, and treat-
ment information logged into the NEISS database by a
designated NEISS coordinator (a trained individual
designated by the hospital that was either an ED staff
member or contracted by CPSC). Statistical weights pro-
vided by CPSC enable generation of national estimates
of the number of injuries treated in all EDs.
The sample includes data from soccer-related injuries
(product code 1267) sustained by individuals at least
2 years of age from January 1, 2004 to December 31,
2013 (n = 63,288). We excluded individuals under 2 years
Kerr et al. Injury Epidemiology (2017) 4:19 Page 2 of 12
of age as we believed that it would not be feasible for an
individual at that age to participate in soccer. Further,
narratives reviews were conducted for individuals aged
2­4 years of age or over 50 years of age to exclude those
clearly unassociated with playing soccer (e.g., being held
by parent who was playing soccer; spectator hit by
soccer ball at grandchild's practice) resulted in 30 exclu-
sions, leading to a final n = 63,258 cases.
HS RIO
HS RIO, which has been previously described, is an
Internet-based sport-related injury surveillance system
that has captured injury and exposure data from a sam-
ple of 100 nationally representative high schools since
the 2005/06 academic year (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2006; Rechel et al. 2008). Eligible high
schools had one or more ATs with a valid email address.
ATs from participating high schools reported injury inci-
dence and athlete exposure information weekly through-
out each academic year using a secure website. For each
injury, ATs completed a detailed injury report on the in-
jured athlete (age, height, weight, etc.), the injury (site,
diagnosis, severity, etc.), and the injury event (activity,
mechanism, etc.). ATs were able to view and update pre-
viously submitted reports as needed with new informa-
tion (e.g., time loss).
A reportable injury in HS RIO was defined as an injury
that: (1) occurred as a result of participation in an orga-
nized practice or competition; (2) required medical at-
tention by an AT or physician; and (3) resulted in
restriction of the student-athlete's participation from
soccer for one or more days beyond the day of injury. In
addition, beginning in 2007/08, ATs were asked to in-
clude any concussion, fracture, or dental injury occur-
ring in an organized practice or game, regardless of
time loss. Only the principal injury was captured. Na-
tional injury estimates are calculated from HS RIO
injury count data using a weighting algorithm based
on the inverse probability of participant schools' se-
lection into the study (based on geographic location
and school size).
NCAA-ISP
The NCAA-ISP, which has been previously described in
detail, is an Internet-based surveillance system that de-
pends on a convenience sample of NCAA institutions
with ATs voluntarily reporting injury and exposure data
(Kerr et al. 2014b). Participation in the NCAA-ISP, while
voluntary, is available to all NCAA institutions. For each
injury event, ATs completed a detailed event report on
the injury or condition (e.g., site, diagnosis) and the cir-
cumstances [e.g., activity, mechanism, event type (i.e.,
competition or practice)]. ATs were able to view and up-
date previously submitted information as needed during
the course of a season. In addition, ATs also provided
the number of student-athletes participating in each
practice and competition. The data were stripped of any
identifiers and personally identifiable information (PII)
retaining only relevant variables.
During the 2009/10­2013/14 academic years, the
Datalys Center introduced new components to the web--
based surveillance system to improve process flow; a
common data element (CDE) standard was implemented
(Kerr et al. 2014b). The CDE standard allows data to be
gathered from various EMR/injury documentation appli-
cations. The CDE export standard allowed ATs to docu-
ment injuries as they normally would as part of their
daily clinical practice, as opposed to asking them to re-
port injuries solely for purposes of participation in an in-
jury surveillance program. Then, the de-identified and
HIPAA-compliant data were sent to the Datalys Center
where it was examined by data quality control staff and
a verification engine (VE) (Kerr et al. 2014b).
A reportable injury in the NCAA-ISP was defined as
an injury that: (1) occurred as a result of participation in
an organized practice or competition; and (2) required
medical attention by a certified athletic trainer (AT) or
physician. The NCAA-ISP included all injuries regard-
less of time loss, and multiple injuries that occurred
from one injury event. To calculate national estimates of
the number of injuries, post-stratification sample
weights, based upon sport, division, and academic year,
were applied to each reported injury and athlete-
exposure. Post-stratification sample weights were calcu-
lated using the formula:
weightijk
¼
Number of ISS Schoolsijk
Number of Sponsoring Schoolsijk
 -1
where weightijk is the weight for the ith sport of the jth
division in the kth year. Weights were further adjusted to
correct for underreporting, according to findings from
Kucera et al. (Kucera et al. 2011), which estimated that
the ISP captured 88.3% of all time-loss medical-care
injury events. Weighted counts were scaled up by a
factor of (0.883)-1.
Study variables
Variables were coded so that all three surveillance sys-
tems presented injury data in similar manners. Body
parts injured were categorized as: Head/face, Neck,
Shoulder, Arm/elbow, Hand/wrist, Trunk, Thigh/upper
leg, Knee, Lower leg, Ankle, Foot, and Other. Diagnoses
were categorized as: Concussion, Contusion, Dislocation,
Fracture, Laceration, Sprain/strain, and Other. The
NEISS data was also categorized by disposition:
Released, Hospitalized, Fatality, and Other (including
transferred, left without being seen, not recorded, etc.).
Kerr et al. Injury Epidemiology (2017) 4:19 Page 3 of 12
Age groups (in years) for NEISS data were categorized
as: 2­4, 5­10, 11­13, 14­17, 18­22, 23­29, 30­39, 40­
49, and 50 + .
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed with SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). For NEISS data, we computed injury rates
overall and by age and sex. Denominator data originated
from intercensal population estimates provided by the
US Census Bureau (US Census Bureau. Population and
Housing Unit Estimates 2017). Injury rates were pre-
sented per 1000 US Census intercensal population esti-
mate. Injury rates ratios (IRRs) compared rates by sex
and age group. Trends for injury rates over time were
analyzed using linear regression. Injury proportion ratios
(IPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calcu-
lated to compare injury proportions between age groups.
The following is an example of an IPR comparing the
proportion of ankle injuries reported in females versus
males within the NEISS data.

X
ankle injuries reported in females in NEISS data

To compare NEISS data to HS RIO and NCAA-ISP
data, we restricted NEISS injury data to those cases aged
14­17 and 18­22 years, respectively. IPRs compared the
distributions of body parts injured and diagnoses
between the 14 and 17 year old NEISS cases and the HS
RIO cases, and between the 18 and 22 year old NEISS
cases and the NCAA-ISP cases. All 95% CIs not containing
1.00 and Linear trend P-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
Injury incidence among those presenting to US EDs
During the study period, 63,258 soccer-related injuries
were captured by NEISS, which translates to an esti-
mated 2,039,250 injuries seen at US EDs nationwide
(Table 1), and an overall injury rate of 0.69/1000 popula-
tion. The mean age of those injured was 17 ± 9 years
(range: 2­95 years). An estimated 61.3% of US soccer-
related injuries occurred in males. The injury rate in
males (0.86/1000 population) was 1.64 times that of
females (0.52/1000 population; 95%CI: 1.61, 1.67). Most
injuries were sustained by individuals aged 14­17 years
(33.7%), 10­13 years (20.7%), 5­9 years (13.0%), and 18­
22 years (11.5%). However, the injury rate was higher
among those aged 14­17 years than all other ages (4.01
vs. 0.48/1000 population; IRR = 8.31; 95%CI: 8.17, 8.45).
The number of estimated injuries ranged from a low
of 173,313 in 2004 to a high of 228,776 in 2013. How-
ever, the smallest and largest yearly injury rates were in
2005 (0.61/1000 population) and 2012 (0.76/1000 popu-
lation), respectively. There was a 22.0% increase in the
overall injury rate (Linear trend P < 0.001), as well as
24.5% and 18.0% increases in male and female injury

rates, respectively (Linear trend P < 0.001 and P = 0.003,
respectively) (Fig. 1). All age groups exhibited linear trends
that indicated increasing injury rates (Fig. 2). The largest
relative increases were seen in individuals aged 50+ years
(66.5%) and 2­4 years (62.1%), although they both were
the lowest overall rates of all age groups; the largest abso-
lute increases were seen in individuals aged 14­17 years
(1.01) and 10­13 years (0.87). Within age groups, the lar-
gest male versus female rate ratios between sexes were
seen among individuals aged 23­29 years (1.04 vs. 0.21/
1000 population; IRR = 4.95; 95% CI: 4.61, 5.32), 30­
39 years (0.57 vs. 0.13/1000 population; IRR = 4.29;
95% CI: 3.96, 4.65), and 40­49 years (0.25 vs. 0.06/
1000 population; IRR = 4.59; 95% CI: 4.06, 5.19).
Injury characteristics among those presenting to US EDs
The most common body parts injured were the head/face
(19.1%), ankle (17.6%), hand/wrist (15.3%), and knee
(12.2%). Females had a larger proportion of ankle injuries
(20.5%; IPR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.35) than males (15.8%).
The most common diagnoses were sprains/strains
(34.0%), fractures (22.2%), and contusions (17.7%).
Compared to females, males had higher proportions of
fractures (24.6% vs. 18.3%; IPR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.27, 1.42)
and lacerations (8.0% vs. 2.5%; IPR = 3.17; 95% CI: 2.81,
3.57). Compared to males, females had a higher propor-
tion of concussions (5.2% vs. 3.5%; IPR = 1.48; 95% CI:
1.26, 1.74).
The majority of injuries presenting to the ED were
treated and released (97.6%) (Table 1). An estimated 151
soccer-related deaths occurred nationwide, based on six
fatalities captured by NEISS during the study period.
Five deaths occurred in males; three deaths were due to
cardiac arrest while playing soccer.
Age differences among those presenting to US EDs
Body part injured and injury diagnosis differed by age
(Table 2). Compared to all other age groups, individ-
uals aged 2­4 years had a higher proportion of head/
face (30.9% vs. 19.0%; IPR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.99)
and arm/elbow injuries (19.9% vs. 6.3%; IPR = 3.14;
95% CI: 2.62, 3.77). Compared to all other age
groups, individuals aged 14­22 years had a higher
proportion of concussions (5.8% vs. 2.7%; IPR = 2.13;
95% CI: 1.90, 2.38).
Comparisons with HS RIO and NCAA-ISP data
Soccer-related injuries presenting to EDs had seasonal
peaks similar to peaks observed in HS RIO and the
NCAA-ISP (Fig. 3). However, the nationally estimated
incidence of injuries presenting to high school and
collegiate ATs based on the HS RIO and the NCAA-ISP
databases were generally higher than the nationally esti-
mated incidence of injuries presenting to EDs based on
the NEISS dataset. Additionally, the national estimates
for injuries for high school student-athletes was larger
than that for NCAA student-athletes.

Kerr et al. Injury Epidemiology (2017) 4:19 Page 5 of 12
Distributions of body parts injured and diagnoses
differed between those presenting to EDs vs. school ATs
(i.e., NEISS: 14­17 year old vs. HS RIO; NEISS: 18­22
years old vs. NCAA-ISP; Table 3). For example,
compared to their respective age ranges in NEISS, thigh/
upper leg injuries comprised a larger proportion of injur-
ies in HS RIO (15.3% vs 1.1%; IPR = 14.06; 95% CI:
12.13, 16.30) and NCAA-ISP (27.0% vs. 1.2%; IPR =
21.85; 95% CI: 16.40, 29.10). Compared to their respect-
ive age ranges in NEISS, concussions comprised a larger
proportion of injuries in HS RIO (17.9% vs. 7.6%; IPR =
2.75; 95% CI: 2.55, 2.96) and NCAA-ISP (5.9% vs. 4.6%;
IPR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.59); sprains/strains also com-
prised a larger proportion of injuries in HS RIO (48.3%
vs. 33.7%; IPR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.42) and NCAA-ISP
(51.3% vs. 37.0%; IPR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.46). In
contrast, fractures comprised a smaller proportion of
injuries in HS RIO (7.5% vs. 18.6%; IPR = 0.43; 95% CI:
0.39, 0.47) and NCAA-ISP (2.8% vs. 15.7%; IPR = 0.18;
95% CI: 0.14, 0.22).
Discussion
Utilizing data from three large national surveillance sys-
tems, this was the first study to 1) describe the epidemi-
ology of soccer injuries across the age span presenting to
EDs and 2) compare the epidemiology of injuries
presenting to the ED to injuries presenting to collegiate
and high school ATs. Previous studies by US researchers
examining soccer-related injuries that utilized
population-based data were largely restricted to analyses
of youth (Adams & Schiff 2006; Leininger et al. 2007;
Walters et al. 2014), were not specific to soccer (Finch
et al. 1998; Kelly et al. 2001), and were approximately a
decade old (Adams & Schiff 2006; Leininger et al. 2007;
Finch et al. 1998; Kelly et al. 2001). Our study used
national estimates to analyze soccer-related injuries in
individuals aged 2 years and older that presented in US
EDs during 2004­2013, and compared those patterns
with two widely used sport surveillance systems, HS
RIO and NCAA-ISP. We found that the patterns of
soccer injuries not only differed across the age span, but

calculated by applying statistical weights provided by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to
actual case counts. Linear trend P-values: 2 to 4 P< 0.001; 5 to 9 P< 0.001; 10 to 13 P< 0.001; 14 to 17 P< 0.001; 18 to 22 P=0.001; 23 to 29 P=0.006; 30

also differed by clinical setting. Thus, our findings con-
tribute important information that could be used to
drive the development of targeted, setting-specific injury
prevention efforts.
Epidemiology of soccer injuries across the Age span
presenting to EDs
Our findings paralleled those seen in previous research
(Adams & Schiff 2006; Leininger et al. 2007; Finch et al.
1998). A large proportion of soccer injuries presenting
to EDs were to the lower extremity, although numerous
wrist/hand injuries also presented. Common diagnoses
included sprains/strains, fractures, and contusions. Rates
and patterns of injury differed by age and sex, with
males having a higher rate of injury than females overall
and the 14­17 year old age group having the highest
rates of injuries compared to all other age groups. The
14­17 year old age group also had the largest absolute
injury rate increase during the study period. This age
group may have the highest rates of injury because par-
ticipation opportunities are abundant, with 791,983
participating in high school soccer during the 2013/14
academic year alone (National Federation of High
Schools 2013), continued increases in participation
across time (National Federation of High Schools 2013),
and levels of play, quality of coaching, and safety of play-
ing facilities vary widely across high school, recreational,
travel, etc. leagues. However, we acknowledge the limita-
tions of utilizing a rate denominator based on intercen-
sal estimates (US Census Bureau. Population and
Housing Unit Estimates 2017), as these undoubtedly in-
clude individuals that do not participate in soccer activ-
ities. Availability of annual age- and sex-specific sports
participation data are limited. Improving the quality and
availability of such participation data would greatly
benefit future studies of population injury risk. Thus,

youth sports governing bodies should be encouraged to
track and make publicly available accurate participation
data. Such data are also important given the recent ban
on heading in youth players 10 years old by the United
States Soccer Federation (US Soccer 2015).
Sex differences
Previous literature utilizing HS RIO and NCAA-ISP data
suggest that in the school sports setting in many gender-
comparable sports, females consistently had higher in-
jury rates than males, overall and within certain injury
types (e.g., concussions, ACL tears) (Hootman et al.
2007; Comstock et al. 2013). However, the ED data eval-
uated in this study showed males consistently had higher
injury rates than females, overall and by age group. This
could reflect differences in the respective populations
presenting to different clinical settings in regards to true
injury incidence or reporting. For example, males out-
side of the high school setting may sustain soccer-
related injuries at a higher rate than females. Or, males
may sustain more severe injuries than females and there-
fore may more frequently present to emergency depart-
ments (Fletcher et al. 2014). However, research has also
noted that cultural differences may be associated with
injury reporting (Gessel et al. 2007). Females may be
more willing to disclose injuries and thus get immediate
treatment; males on the other hand may only report in-
juries when they are more severe and require ED inter-
vention. Our findings emphasize the need to continue
examining the biomechanical and behavioral effects that
may be associated with injury incidence and reporting
across all ages. Nonetheless, our findings may also be as-
sociated with variations existing among data collection.
For example, HS RIO and NCAA-ISP only look at injury
rates among actual participants in school-sanctioned
practices and competitions, whereas our rates with
NEISS data consider injury rates per population. Actual
participation in soccer may vary by sex, which may have
biased NEISS-based injury rates.
Comparing the epidemiology of injuries presenting to the
ED to injuries presenting to collegiate and high school ATs
Utilizing an ED data source such as NEISS provides
opportunities to understand patterns of the most severe
injuries sustained by individuals participating in sports.
However, many sports-related injuries present to and are
treated by sports medicine physicians and ATs when
they are present at sports practices and competitions
thus reducing the number of individuals presenting to
EDs. New opportunities now exist to understand the en-
tire spectrum of sports-related injuries, rather than just
the most severe injuries that present to traditionally
clinical settings, because the presence of sports injury
surveillance systems has increased, with focused efforts
seen in numerous settings, including youth leagues
(Dompier et al. 2015a), high school athletics (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention 2006; Rechel et al. 2008;
Dompier et al. 2015b), college athletics (Kerr et al.
2014b; Swedler et al. 2015), and within the military
(Loringer et al. 2008). However, the ED may provide the
easiest access to injury data in settings lacking the pres-
ence of an AT or team sports physician. Although

methods of injury reporting vary, ranging from onsite ATs
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2006; Rechel
et al. 2008; Kerr et al. 2014b; Dompier et al. 2015a; b) to
the participants themselves (Swedler et al. 2015; Loringer
et al. 2008), a comprehensive evaluation of data from such
surveillance systems has the potential to better describe
the epidemiology of sports-related injury.
In this study, we used surveillance system data gath-
ered from EDs (NEISS) and ATs employed at high
schools (HS RIO) and colleges (NCAA-ISP) to more
fully examine patterns of soccer-related injuries. As seen
in previous research with basketball (Fletcher et al.
2014), injuries that were more likely to be easily diag-
nosed and treated such as sprains/strains comprised a
larger proportion of injuries reported by ATs in the high
school and college settings. Meanwhile, injuries with
more complex diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation
schedules, such as fractures, comprised a larger propor-
tion of injuries presenting to EDs. However, sprains/
strains comprised the largest proportion of injuries in all
three settings. Findings slightly differed when NEISS
data were compared to HS RIO and NCAA-ISP; this
may be due to varying injury definitions used by both
surveillance systems. Because the NCAA-ISP also
included injuries resulting in <24 h of time loss, it is pos-
sible that a larger proportion of injuries that were less se-
vere were in the dataset. This would explain the larger
proportion of contusions and the smaller proportion of
fractures in the NCAA-ISP dataset. Thus, as injury sur-
veillance data are used, it is important to understand how
the inclusion/exclusion of certain injuries, based upon the
definition used, may affect injury distributions.
As noted by Fletcher et al. (2014), EDs may be tasked
with dealing with non-urgent injuries, particularly when
no sports medicine clinician is available (e.g., those high
schools without AT coverage) (Pitts et al. 2008) and/or
when those in attendance (e.g., coaches, referees, par-
ents) have little/no experience in injury management/

treatment. Overcrowding may burden hospital resources
(Trzeciak & Rivers 2003) and can be associated with
higher patient mortality (Richardson 2006). Because they
triage injuries and care for more minor injuries not re-
quiring ED care, the presence of ATs mitigates the need
for some ED services among student-athletes within
high school and college settings. However, it is estimated
that 30% of high schools lack access to ATs (Pryor et al.
2015), and as a result, patterns of reported injuries may
differ between schools with and without ATs meaning
many sports-related injuries that could be managed by
school ATs likely still present to EDs across the US. Fur-
thermore, although it is advocated at the NCAA level
that all member institutions provide appropriate AT
coverage across all sports and divisions (National
Collegiate Athletic Association 2014), variations have
been found in the provision of aspects of sports injury
management, such as concussion baseline testing proto-
cols (Kerr et al. 2015). It is possible that such variations
based upon sport and division extend beyond this and
would thus affect the care provided to athletes by
medical staff. Previous findings have suggested the bene-
fits of having sports medicine professionals onsite
(Fletcher et al. 2014; Kerr et al. 2014a; Wham et al. 2008;
2010) and are coupled with support from organizations
such as the American Medical Association (1998). Our
findings may provide further support for school-based
sports medicine professionals. However, because our study
did not examine additional metrics such as financial costs,
medical outcomes, etc., future research is warranted to de-
termine the potential benefits of on-site sports medicine
professionals comprehensively.
Concussions
Females presented to EDs with a larger proportion of
concussions than males. This finding follows previous
research which has found higher rates and proportions
of concussions among female soccer players than male
soccer players (Gessel et al. 2007; Marar et al. 2012;
Delaney et al. 2002; Dick et al. 2007; Agel et al. 2007).
Similarly in previous HS RIO and NCAA-ISP research,
the reported concussion rate in female soccer players
was significantly higher than that of male soccer players
(Rosenthal et al. 2014; Zuckerman et al. 2015). Reasons
for the sex differences have been discussed in the litera-
ture, ranging from different styles of play (Gessel et al.
2007) to biomechanical differences (Barnes et al. 1998;
Mansell et al. 2005), particularly that compared to males,
females may have smaller head-to-ball ratios, weaker
necks, or less total mass in their heads and necks. Previ-
ously (Collins et al. 2014), a study with high school
students found that increased neck strength was associ-
ated with a decreased odds of concussion. Mechanisms
of injury may also differ by sex, as high school data
suggests that compared to boys, concussions among girls
were more likely to occur due to contact with the play-
ing surface or ball while boys are more commonly in-
jured due to contact with another player (Marar et al.
2012). Continued examination of these risk factors
should help drive efforts to reduce the concussion dis-
parity between sexes while reducing overall incidence.
Concussions comprised a smaller proportion of injuries
in NEISS compared to HS RIO and NCAA-ISP. It is pos-
sible that the larger proportions of concussions in the high
school and collegiate settings observed here represent in-
creased awareness via coaching and player education.
Because ATs are on-site, they may be able to provide im-
mediate management and provide concussed athletes with
resources and referrals to assist in proper return-to-play
(and return-to-learning). This may reduce the presence of
concussions presenting to EDs. However, future research
is warranted to further demonstrate the benefits of ATs,
particularly with concussion management.
In recent years, concussion rates have increased,
suggesting that the proportion of concussions being re-
ported is increasing as well (Rosenthal et al. 2014). Al-
though concussions go unreported at the high school
and college settings (Kerr et al. 2014c), we are unaware
of the proportion of concussions outside of these set-
tings that go unreported. The difference in proportions
of injuries that are concussions may be associated
with various settings for immediate concussion man-
agement. Further, this difference may underscore the
importance of having sports medicine clinicians
present at practices and competitions, particularly to
help identify symptomatology and remove suspected
concussed athletes from participation.
Limitations
Accurate national soccer participation data encompassing
all levels of play is difficult to obtain. Furthermore, data
that does exist rarely includes participation in unorganized
events such as pick-up games. As a result, we utilized
intercensal population estimates from the census which
may have resulted in either an underestimate or overesti-
mate of the true rates of soccer-related injuries. The
generalizability of our findings may be limited. Whereas
NEISS captures all soccer-related injuries from all levels of
play, HS RIO and NCAA-ISP only capture events occur-
ring during school-sanctioned practices and competitions.
Variations in medical presence at the high school and col-
lege sport settings may have led to underreporting,
although the NCAA Sports Medicine Handbook advo-
cates AT coverage for all sports at its member institutions
(National Collegiate Athletic Association 2014), and ap-
proximately 70% of US high school athletic programs re-
ceive some level of AT coverage (Pryor et al. 2015).
Kerr et al. Injury Epidemiology (2017) 4:19 Page 10 of 12
NEISS data included only those injuries that presented
to EDs and may have excluded those that were or per-
ceived to be less severe in nature. The likelihood of pre-
senting to an ED may also be dependent on various
demographic- and injury-related factors. The NEISS cases
were selected on the basis of case narratives, some of
which are not detailed and thus we may have included
some cases that did not actually occur during active soccer
participation; case-by-case examinations were only per-
formed at the extreme age ranges. The NEISS cases also
lacked follow-up detail provided in HS RIO or NCAA-ISP,
such as injury mechanism, symptomology, and severity.
Additionally, it is unknown if NEISS cases received treat-
ment from an AT prior to presenting to the ED. Although
all three surveillance systems relied upon the expertise of
medical staff, all of whom were trained for data collection,
it is still possible that there were variations in the report-
ing and diagnosis of injuries.
Last, it is important to highlight that our analyses com-
puted effect estimates that have been discussed by sports
injury epidemiologists in the context of their practicality
and usefulness (Knowles et al. 2006; 2010; Comstock &
Fields 2010). The IRR and the IPR provide different types
of comparisons. Whereas the IRR answers which of the
two groups being compared had a higher incidence of in-
jury per unit of exposure, the IPR answers in which of the
two groups being compared does a specific injury com-
prise a greater percentage of all injuries (Comstock &
Fields 2010). As previously noted, the use of intercensal
population estimates may have resulted in either an
underestimate or overestimate of the true rates of soccer-
related injuries and may create invalid comparisons to HS
RIO and NCAA-ISP data. Thus, when comparing NEISS
data to those of HS RIO and NCAA-ISP, we opted to use
the IPR. This metric has an important role in sports injury
epidemiology and these comparisons still contribute to
the body of literature examining soccer-related injuries.
However, it is important to understand the difference be-
tween IRRs and IPRs, and as with any statistical analysis,
be cautious with interpretation.
Conclusions
Patterns of soccer-related injuries presenting to EDs
varied by age and sex, with males and 14­17 year olds
having the highest injury rates. In addition, patterns of
soccer-related injuries presenting to EDs and ATs in high
school and collegiate settings varied. Our findings may
highlight the importance of having an AT present at high
school and collegiate soccer competitions and practices.
Their presence can help capture injuries that otherwise
might have gone undiagnosed (i.e., concussions), and pro-
vide treatment in the school setting, therefore preventing
unnecessary and costly visits to the ED. However, further
research is needed to comprehensively examine the
potential economic- and health-related benefits of having
on-site sports medicine professionals.
