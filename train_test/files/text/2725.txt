Purpose: Although higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower levels of sense
of mastery tend to be comorbid, limited information exists on racial differences in the
longitudinal associations between the two over time. The current study compared Black
and White American older adults for the longitudinal links between depressive symptoms
and mastery in the United States.
Methods: Using data from the Religion, Aging, and Health Survey, 2001­2004, this
longitudinal cohort study followed 1493 Black (n = 734) and White (n = 759) elderly
individuals (age 66 or more) for 3 years. Depressive symptoms [Center for Epidemiological
Studies-Depression scale (CES-D), 8 items] and mastery (Pearlin Mastery Scale, 7 items)
were measured in 2001 and 2004. Demographics, socio-economics, and physical health
were covariates and race was the focal moderator. Multi-group structural equation
modeling was used for data analysis, where groups were defined based on race.
Results: Among White but not Black older adults, higher levels of depressive symptoms
at baseline predicted a greater decline in sense of mastery over 3 years of follow-up.
Similarly among Whites but not Blacks, individuals with lower mastery at baseline
developed more depressive symptoms over time.
Conclusion: Findings are indicative of Black-White differences in reciprocal associations
between depressive symptoms and mastery over time. Race alters how depression is
linked to changes in evaluation of self (e.g., mastery) over time.

INTRODUCTION
According to the Black-White health paradox, one of the mysteries of health research (Keyes, 2009;
Barnes et al., 2013; Mouzon, 2013, 2014; Assari et al., 2015; Watkins et al., 2015), despite higher
exposure to psychosocial and economic stress and adversities, Blacks less frequently meet criteria
for depression compared to Whites (Owen, 1996; Lindhorst et al., 2007; Signorello et al., 2007;
Williams et al., 2007; González et al., 2010; Cabassa et al., 2013; Jackson et al., 2013; Johnson-
Lawrence et al., 2013). In line with this paradox, Blacks and Whites differ in psychosocial and health
Assari and Lankarani Depressive Symptoms-Mastery; Race Differences
factors that correlate with depression and depressive symptoms
(Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2007; Gavin et al., 2010; Lewis et al., 2011;
Barnes et al., 2013; Capistrant et al., 2013; Assari and Lankarani,
2014; Assari, 2014d; Assari et al., 2016b). This hypothesis is
supported by research showing that depression increases the risk
of chronic medical conditions among Whites but not Blacks
(Assari et al., 2015, 2016a). Depressive symptoms predict chronic
medical conditions (Assari et al., 2015) and all-cause (Assari
et al., 2016a; Moazen-Zadeh and Assari, 2016) and cause-specific
(Assari and Burgard, 2015) mortality among Whites but not
Blacks. In another set of studies, depressive symptoms have
failed to correlate with expected biological markers, such as
inflammatory markers (Case, 2014; Stewart, 2016; Vrany et al.,
2016).
The first possible explanation proposed by Keyes for the
Black-White health paradox is that Blacks may experience some
levels of growth or flourishing in the presence of adversities
(Keyes, 2009). Assari has found that Blacks are systematically
more resilient to the effects of psycho-social factors, which
may reflect an adaptive resilience of Blacks as a result of life
under economic and social adversity, or culture (Krause, 2002;
Assari et al., 2016c; Assari, 2016a,b,c; Assari and Lankarani,
2016b; Assari and Dejman, 2016). These two explanations are
supported by studies documenting higher availability and efficacy
of interpersonal psychosocial resources, such as social support
and religion, for Blacks than Whites (Lincoln et al., 2003; Keyes,
2009; Barnes et al., 2013; Mouzon, 2013, 2014; Assari et al.,
2015). Jackson has suggested that Blacks use behavioral coping
mechanisms that lower the risk of emotional problems, however,
increase the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular conditions
(Jackson and Knight, 2006; Mezuk et al., 2010, 2013).
There are also a series of methodological explanations that
attribute this paradox to measurement errors or selection biases.
For instance, some evidence suggests that depression measures
that are designed and validated for Whites fail to capture
depression in Blacks (Moazen-Zadeh and Assari, 2016). In one
study, baseline depressive symptoms were predictive of the
subsequent risk of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) after 15
years among Whites but not Blacks (Moazen-Zadeh and Assari,
2016). This view is also supported by the literature suggesting
lower validity of depressive measures among Blacks (Williams
et al., 2007) as well as studies that depression may differently
present among Blacks and Whites (Brown et al., 1996; Blazer
et al., 1998; Zayas et al., 2002).
The third generation of explanations recently proposed by
Assari is that depression differently influences dysfunctional
attitudes about self (e.g., mastery), others, and the future (e.g.,
Hope) (Assari, 2016a; Assari and Lankarani, 2016a; Assari and
Dejman, 2016). In this view, depression is qualitatively different
among Blacks and Whites; thus Blacks and Whites may differ
in the link between depression and mastery, defined as a sense
of having control over the forces that affect one's life (Fok
et al., 2012). We argue that high levels of psychosocial resources,
such as social support and religion, may make Blacks more
resistant to decline in mastery in the face of social adversities
(Lincoln et al., 2003; Assari, 2013; Mouzon, 2013, 2014). Level
of mastery will have implications on how stress may affect
depression among Blacks and Whites (Assari and Lankarani,
2016c). This view is also supported by studies suggesting that
locus of control, mastery, self-efficacy, and control over life
may not have similar meanings in Whites and Blacks (Deaton
and Lubotsky, 2003; Dressler et al., 2005; Dowd and Zajacova,
2007; Assari, 2014c, 2016e; Assari et al., 2016c). In a number of
studies, Assari has shown that depression differently influences
dysfunctional attitudes about self, others, and the future (Assari,
2016a; Assari and Lankarani, 2016a; Assari and Dejman, 2016).
For instance, lower levels of these control beliefs may have more
significant health consequences for Whites than Blacks (Assari,
2016c).
Built on the differential effect hypothesis (Assari, 2016b,d;
Assari and Lankarani, 2016b; Assari and Sonnega, 2016), we
conducted the current study to compare Black and White
American older adults for the reciprocal longitudinal associations
between depressive symptoms and mastery over time. This
hypothesis is in line with what Belsky and others have
called `differential susceptibility to environmental influences' or
`differential susceptibility to the context' (Belsky, 1997; Boyce
and Ellis, 2005; Belsky et al., 2007; Belsky and Pluess, 2009).
Given that previous studies have shown that religion and social
support may be more available and effective for Blacks compared
to Whites (Krause, 2006a; Skarupski et al., 2013) paired with the
finding that Blacks are more resilient to the effect of psychosocial
factors (Krause, 2002; Assari, 2016a,b,c; Assari and Lankarani,
2016b; Assari and Dejman, 2016; Assari et al., 2016c), we
expected to observe weaker reciprocal longitudinal links between
depressive symptoms and mastery among Blacks compared to
Whites. We used nationally representative data to generate
results that are generalizable to the U.S. population of older
adults.
METHODS
Design and Setting
With a longitudinal panel design, data came from Waves 1 and 2
of the Religion, Aging, and Health Survey, 2001­2004. The study
is a 3 year follow up of a nationally representative household
sample of Black and White older adults in the U.S. (Krause,
2006b, 2009).
Sampling and Participants
The study participants were either White or Black older adults.
Older Blacks were over-sampled in the survey. All participants
were non-institutionalized English speaking people of ages
greater than 65 years. The study population was limited to those
who were either Christians or those who were never associated
with any faith.
Measures
Race, demographic data (age and gender), and socio economic
status (education) were measured at baseline in 2001. Number
of chronic medical conditions (13 chronic medical conditions)
was measured in 2004. Depressive symptoms and mastery were
measured in 2001 and 2004.

Assari and Lankarani Depressive Symptoms-Mastery; Race Differences
Depressive Symptoms
An 8­item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale
(CES-D) (Radloff, 1977) was used to measure depressive
symptoms in 2001 and 2004. Items measured the extent to
which respondents felt depressed or had somatic symptoms.
Abbreviated CES-D measures have shown acceptable reliability
and similar validity as compared to the original 20­item version
(Andresen et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2012; Amtmann et al., 2014).
Items used were as the following: (1) I felt I could not shake off
the blues even with the help of my family and friends, (2) I felt
depressed, (3) I had crying spells, (4) I felt sad, (5) I did not
feel like eating, my appetite was poor, (6) I felt that everything
I did was an effort, (7) My sleep was restless, and (8) I could
not get going. All these items were selected from the negative
domain of the CES-D; positive affect and interpersonal items
were not reflected in this version of the CES-D. Item responses
were 1 ("rarely or none") to 4 ("most or all of the time"). We
calculated the mean score which treated depressive symptoms as
a continuous measure, with a potential range from 1 to 4. Higher
scores indicated more severe depressive symptoms. (Abu-Raiya
et al., 2016; Hayward and Krause, 2016)
Mastery
We used seven items from the Pearlin Mastery Scale (Cairney and
Krause, 2008). Items included (1) You have little control over
the things that happen to you, (2) There is really no way you
can solve some of the problems you have, (3) There is little you
can do to change many of the important things in your life, (4)
Sometimes you feel that you are being pushed around in life, (5)
What happens to you in the future mostly depends upon you,
(6) You can do just about anything you really set your mind to,
and (7) You often feel helpless in dealing with the problems of
life (Pearlin and Pioli, 2003). This construct is similar to sense
of control (Wheaton, 1983; Rodin, 1986; Mirowsky, 1995, 1997).
We calculated a mean score where a higher score was indicative of
a greater sense of mastery (range = 0­4). Some of the items were
reverse coded. The internal reliability of the scale (Cronbach's
alpha) at Wave 1 was 0.94.
Number of Chronic Medical Conditions
The presence of the following chronic medical conditions were
measured during the past 12 months: (1) hypertension, (2)
heart problem, (3) diabetes, (4) cancer, (5) kidney disease,
(6) arthritis or rheumatism, (7) intestinal disorders, (8) liver
disease, (9) urinary tract disorders, (10) eye diseases, (11) any
respiratory disease, and (12) any other major health problem.
Possible responses included yes [1], no [0], and do not know
(missing data). Number of conditions potentially ranged between
0 and 12, where a higher score was indicative of more chronic
conditions. (Watkins et al., 2015) We decided to control for
chronic medical conditions as physical health is correlated
with mastery and depressive symptoms and may confound
their link. Medical conditions may, however, be differently
linked to depression based on race (MacKinnon et al., 2000;
Lynch et al., 2010; Lewis et al., 2011; Barnes et al., 2013;
Capistrant et al., 2013; Assari and Burgard, 2015; Assari et al.,
2015).
Statistical Analysis
We used SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) for univariate and
bivariate analyses. We used AMOS 20 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY)
for multivariable analysis. For bivariate associations, Pearson's
correlations tests, independent sample t-tests, and paired t-
tests were used. For multivariable analysis, we ran multi-group
structural equation modeling (SEM) to test if baseline depressive
symptoms and mastery predict subsequent depressive symptoms
and mastery, while age, education, gender, and chronic medical
conditions were controlled. We ran a multi-group model where
groups were defined based on race (Kline, 2010). P < 0.05 was
considered significant.
The Amos software computes maximum likelihood estimates
in the presence of missing data (Allison, 2002; Arbuckle, 2012).
Model fit was evaluated by examining the chi-square statistic, the
comparative fit index (CFI), and the root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA). A non-significant chi-square statistic,
a chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio of less than 4, a CFI
above 0.95, and a RMSEA value of 0.06 or less were considered
as indicators of good fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999; Lei and Lomax,
2005).
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
The study followed 1493 older adults (age 65 or greater) for
3 years. This sample included 734 Blacks and 759 Whites.
Descriptive statistics overall and also based on race are shown
in Table 1. While age was not significantly different between the
racial groups, Blacks were more female, and had lower education.
Blacks reported more depressive symptoms than Whites.
Multivariable Model
Our model showed an excellent fit to the data (p = 0.468, CMIN
= 1.519, DF = 2, CMIN/DF = 0.759, CFI = 1.000, RMSEA
= 0.000, 90% CI = 0.000­0.057; Figures 1, 2). Depressive
symptoms at baseline was associated with decline in mastery over
time among Whites ( = 0.10, p = 0.013) but not Blacks ( =
0.04, p = 0.369). Mastery at baseline was also predictive of an
increase in depressive symptoms over time among Whites ( =
0.11, p = 0.007) but not Blacks ( = 0.05, p = 0.255). Baseline age
and gender were associated with change in depressive symptoms
for Whites but not Blacks. Number of medical conditions was
predictive of change in mastery and depressive symptoms among
Whites and Blacks (Table 2, Figures 1, 2).
DISCUSSION
In a nationally representative sample of older adults in U.S.,
we found that sense of mastery and depressive symptoms have
reciprocal links among Whites but not Blacks. These Black-White
differences are in line with other racial differences in psychosocial
and medical correlates of depression (Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2007;
Gavin et al., 2010; Lewis et al., 2011; Capistrant et al., 2013; Assari
and Lankarani, 2014; Assari, 2014d; Assari and Burgard, 2015;
Assari et al., 2015, 2016a,b,c; Watkins et al., 2015; Moazen-Zadeh
and Assari, 2016) that collectively support the differential effect
hypothesis and differential susceptibility to context.

These findings enhance our understanding regarding the
relevance of Beck's negative cognitive triad to racially diverse
groups. Based on Beck's theory, depression is a dysfunctional
evaluation of self, others, and the future (Beck et al., 1990).
It has been previously shown that depression and hopelessness
(dysfunctional evaluation of the future) have stronger links
among Whites than Blacks (Assari and Lankarani, 2016a). These
findings suggest that race may alter how distorted evaluation
of self, others, and the future reflects depression among
populations. These findings have major clinical implications for
psychotherapy and cognitive therapy of depression in diverse
populations (Assari and Lankarani, 2016a).

Lincoln (Lincoln et al., 2003) and others (Assari, 2013; Assari,
under review) have argued that social and psychological factors
operate differently across racial and ethnic groups. Psychosocial
processes may operate in unique manners that are distinct across
each racial and ethnic group (Lincoln et al., 2003). In this view,
the assumption of similarity between Blacks and Whites is the
result of an absence of previous studies on race/ethnic differences,
and does not have empirical evidence (Hunt, 1996; Hunt et al.,
2000; Lincoln et al., 2003; McDowell, 2010; Assari, 2016c). Our
findings suggest that the psychosocial processes that result in
depression may depend on race.
Racial groups have unique histories, values, and cultures,
which combine with life circumstances and experiences that
make them differently vulnerable or resilient to risk and
protective factors. In this view, the very same social factors, and
the very same psychosocial theory may differently operate across
all social groups (Lincoln et al., 2003). Understanding of group
differences in psychosocial processes that contribute to health
Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 5 January 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 279
Assari and Lankarani Depressive Symptoms-Mastery; Race Differences
and illness is essential for the promotion of health and wellbeing
through altering social or psychological factors across diverse
populations (Lincoln et al., 2003). This argument is core to the
differential effect hypothesis (Assari, 2016d).
It has been shown that overall social support and support
from fellow church members are stronger predictive factors
against psychological distress and depressive symptoms among
Blacks compared to Whites (Lincoln et al., 2003; Krause, 2006a;
Assari and Burgard, 2015; Assari, under review). In 2013,
Assari showed that religious (church-based) social support fully
mediated the association between church attendance and overall
life satisfaction for Blacks but not Whites (Assari, 2013). These
are all in line with what Skarupski et al., called the Blacks' "faith
advantage in health" (Skarupski et al., 2013).
Our finding adds to the existing knowledge on racial
differences in the complex associations between socioeconomic
status (SES), psychosocial resources (e.g., social support, coping,
stress), depression, and health (Drevenstedt, 1998; Krause, 2002;
Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2010; Gariepy et al.,
2010; Gavin et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2012; Flegal et al.,
2013; Assari, 2014a,b; Patel et al., 2014; Assari et al., 2016c).
Race modifies how SES affects depression, health behaviors,
and mortality (Flegal et al., 2013; Patel et al., 2014) and how
depression is linked to obesity (Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2007;
Gavin et al., 2010; Assari, 2014a,b), chronic medical conditions
(Assari and Lankarani, 2014; Watkins et al., 2015), self-rated
health (Assari, 2014d; Assari and Burgard, 2015; Assari et al.,
2015), and mortality (Assari and Burgard, 2015; Assari et al.,
2016a).
Race differences in vulnerabilities to the effect of risk and
protective factors may be a consequence of racial differences
in exposure to psychosocial risk and protective factors (Ferraro
and Kelley-Moore, 2001; Lee et al., 2007; Assari and Burgard,
2015; Assari et al., 2016c), race differences in the nature of
depression or mastery (Moazen-Zadeh and Assari, 2016), or
racial differences in what psychosocial constructs reflect (Assari
et al., 2016c). These non-specific racial differences suggest that
race does not have a direct effect on health, or simply through
SES, but has contextual effects that alter how resources and risk
factors impact physical or mental health (Capistrant et al., 2013;
Assari, 2014a,c,d, 2015; Assari et al., 2015, 2016c).
The missing link between depressive symptoms and mastery
among Blacks may explain why depressive symptoms have
weaker effects on self-rated health, medical conditions, and
mortality among Blacks compared to Whites (Drevenstedt, 1998;
Ferraro and Kelley-Moore, 2001; Dowd and Zajacova, 2007; Lee
et al., 2007; Assari and Burgard, 2015; Assari et al., 2016d).
In a consistent pattern, regardless of the type of the predictor,
psychological variables better predict physical and mental health
outcomes for Whites compared to Blacks (Ferraro and Kelley-
Moore, 2001; Dowd and Zajacova, 2007; Lee et al., 2007;
Assari, 2016e). These suggest higher resilience of Blacks toward
different risk factors, possibly due to historical exposure to
adversity.
Our findings may have implications for the elimination
of racial health disparities in the US, which have existed
for several decades (Deaton and Lubotsky, 2003; Dressler
et al., 2005). This finding may also be relevant to the
ongoing increasing trends of mortality due to mental disorders,
depression, and alcohol use among White men (Case and
Deaton, 2015). We believe that mastery is central to trajectories
of mental disorders and chronic disease, particularly for
Whites.
Our study is subject to a number of limitations. First
and foremost, we measured depressive symptoms, not major
depressive disorder, which would have required a structural
interview. We also did not measure history of anti depressant
use, which affects the course of depression. Third, we did not
control for potential confounders, such as stress, religiosity, social
support, and cognitive ability. Fourth, we used short versions
of standard measures of mastery and depressive symptoms.
Despite these limitations, this study was one of the firsts on
racial differences in the links between mastery and depressive
symptoms over time among older adults. Using a nationally
representative sample and large sample size of Blacks can be listed
as strengths of this study.
To conclude, race alters the reciprocal and longitudinal
associations between depressive symptoms and sense of mastery
over time. Black-White differences in the link between depression
and mastery may explain why depression and depressive
symptoms better predict chronic medical conditions and
mortality among Whites than Blacks. Future research should
test whether racial differences in the paths between depression
and mastery is due to racial differences in quality of depression
and control beliefs, racial differences in availability and effects of
psychosocial factors (e.g., SES, religiosity, and social support) or
differential salience of dysfunctional attitudes about self, others,
and the future explain these differences between Blacks and
Whites.
