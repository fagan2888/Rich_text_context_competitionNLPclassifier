Low Mineral Intake Is Associated
with High Systolic Blood Pressure in the

Nutrition Examination Surveys
Could We All Be Right?

Analysis of the first National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) in 1984 revealed that a
dietary pattern low in mineral intake, specifically cal-
cium, potassium, and magnesium, was associated with
hypertension in American adults. Using more recent
survey data from NHANES III and NHANES IV, we
re-examined the validity of this relationship. Blood
pressure (BP) and nutrient intake data from 10,033 adult
participants in NHANES III and 2311 adults in
NHANES IV revealed findings similar to those of the
earlier analysis, demonstrating that the association be-
tween inadequate mineral consumption and higher BP is
valid and has persisted over two decades. Exploring this
relationship further, we separated untreated hyperten-
sive persons by hypertension type (systolic, diastolic, or
both), and observed that the BP effect of low mineral
intake was most pronounced in those with only systolic
hypertension. We also observed that sodium intake was
significantly lower in the systolic hypertension group
and significantly higher in the diastolic hypertension
group compared with the other groups. The nutrient
pattern in the combined hypertension group was similar
to that of the normotensive group. These findings may
help to explain the inconsistent responses generally
observed in dietary intervention studies, and they high-
light the possible importance of tailored nutritional rec-
ommendations for hypertension based on hypertension
category and individual dietary practices. Although ran-
domized controlled trials are needed to characterize
further the relationship between nutrient intake and
hypertension type, these findings indicate that dietary
management of hypertension may be more effective if
the focus is on the overall nutritional profile rather than
single-nutrient intake as currently recommended for
most patients. Am J Hypertens 2005;18:261­269

An analysis of the First National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES I) published
in 19841 identified inadequate dietary intakes of
calcium and potassium as the mineral/electrolyte pattern
that best predicted the presence of hypertension, particu-
larly high systolic pressure, in adults. Among Americans,
a diet containing adequate intakes of dairy foods, fruits,
and vegetables (similar to what has subsequently been
labeled the DASH diet2), was associated with the lowest
blood pressure (BP) in NHANES I. Numerous population
surveys have confirmed the beneficial impact of dietary
calcium, as a surrogate for adequate mineral intake, on BP
levels in general3 and most consistently on systolic BP.4
In the 1984 analysis of NHANES I, higher levels of
dietary sodium were not related to higher BP.1 As noted in
that report, the NHANES I data suggested the reverse, ie,
BP tracked inversely with dietary sodium. Analyses by
others confirmed the findings that not only lower calcium
but also lower sodium intake was linked to higher BP in
NHANES I.5 Similar observations have been reported

from epidemiologic surveys.6,7 Randomized trials have
also confirmed a BP-lowering effect of adequate mineral
consumption from foods and from supplements.2,8­10
However, although BP responses to increased mineral
intake vary among individuals, the effect is typically
greater when foods are the mineral source.2,8,9,11 This
suggests that the combination of naturally occurring nu-
trients in foods contributes to the BP-lowering effect.
The 1984 NHANES I analysis revealed that inadequate
levels of mineral intake was the nutrient profile that best
predicted hypertension risk in adults. We hypothesized
that this relationship continues to exist and would be
observed again in more recent dietary survey data. Using
NHANES III (1989 to 1991 and 1991 to 1994) and
NHANES IV (1999 to 2000), we examined the relation-
ship between the intake of dietary nutrients and BP levels
in American adults. We extended the analysis to explore
whether sodium intake or BP category influenced this
relationship.
Methods
National Surveys
As with the previous surveys, NHANES III and IV were
designed to obtain a representative sample of the popula-
tion in the United States using a complex, stratified, mul-
tistage probability cluster sampling design.12,13 The
surveys consisted of partial probability samples of house-
holds in the 48 contiguous states. Institutionalized and
homeless persons were not included. The NHANES III
study was designed to be nationally representative for
either 3 or 6 years of data collection, whereas NHANES
IV was designed to give an annual sample that is nation-
ally representative.
In both surveys, adults responded to survey questions
in home interviews. Interviewees were subsequently
examined in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) in
examinations lasting approximately 3 h. A modified
home examination was offered to a limited number of
adults 60 years of age who could not come to the
MEC. Both surveys over-sampled adults 60 years,
Mexican Americans, and African Americans to produce
more reliable estimates for these groups. For this study,
only adults examined in the MEC or at a modified home
examination were included. The Institutional Review
Board of the University of California at Davis reviewed
the protocol for this study.
Sample
The NHANES III data sets from 1989 to 1991 and 1991 to
1994 were combined (39,695 individuals) to achieve suf-
ficient sample sizes for adults-only population subgroups
(n  20,050) and then for adults with reliable dietary data
(n  18,056). Although there was no upper age limit in
NHANES III, we opted to use 75 years of age, similar to
the upper limit of 74 years used by McCarron et al1 for
NHANES I, to enhance comparability of results. A final
sample was generated to meet the following criteria: age
20 to 75 years, not pregnant, and not lactating. As reported
for the previous article,1 we excluded persons who were
currently taking medications for high BP or diabetes or
who had been told by a physician that they had hyperten-
sion or diabetes (Table 1). Given that our analyses were
restricted to individuals without hypertension and the
higher risk of hypertension among non-Hispanic individ-
uals of African American ethnicity, we eliminated a dis-
proportionate number of non-Hispanic African Americans
from the original sample.
For NHANES IV, the two annual data sets were com-
bined (9650 individuals), producing an adults-only sample
of 4706 with an examination at the MEC. A final sample
was generated to meet the same criteria mentioned above.
Comparable percentages of participants in both NHANES
III and IV were excluded based on a prior history of

50% of the participants in both NHANES III and IV met
the inclusion criteria, resulting in final samples of 10,033
and 2311 respectively.
Nutrient Variables
We selected dietary factors commonly thought to influ-
ence BP by either direct or indirect means. Previous re-
search was the basis for selection of two combination
variables: the combined mineral intake variable (potas-
sium  calcium  magnesium) and the sodium/potassium
ratio variable.2,9,11 Those nutrients and nutrient variables
are identified in Table 2.
Measurements
The average of BP measurements during the household
interview (n  3) and MEC examination (n  2) were
used in NHANES III. For NHANES IV, the average BP
reported to the examinee was used. For nutrient consump-
tion, 24-h dietary recalls were analyzed for energy, pro-
tein, carbohydrates, total fat, dietary fiber, and the
micronutrients calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium,
phosphorus, iron, and vitamins C, E, and A. Calcium,
potassium, and magnesium were combined for a mineral
variable, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio was calcu-
lated. Hypertension categories were defined as follows:

mm Hg, also referred to as diastolic hypertension; and 3)
systolic and diastolic pressures 140 and 90 mm Hg,
respectively, also referred to as combined hypertension
and high mean arterial BP.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis
System, release 8.1 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). Appropriate statistical weights were used to adjust
for over-sampling of some groups and for nonresponse of
some individuals in NHANES III (WTPFHX6) and
NHANES IV (WTMEC2YR). Means and standard errors
were calculated for the total sample and for the four BP
subgroups for demographic characteristics, BP, and
macro- and micronutrients. Regression analysis was used
to examine differences between groups. Finally, multivar-
iate regression was used to determine whether unadjusted
effects remained after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity,
body mass index (BMI), alcohol, and energy intake. Dif-
ferences were considered significant at values of P  .05.
Results
Table 2 compares the unadjusted nutrient profile and pop-
ulation characteristics for the normotensive compared with
newly diagnosed hypertensive participants in NHANES
III and IV. In both surveys, participants with hypertension
differed significantly from normotensive persons in age
and body mass index (BMI) (all P  .0001). The mean age
of the hypertensive group was approximately 15 years
older than that of the normotensive group in NHANES III
and 5 years older in NHANES IV. The BMI were approx-
imately 2.5 kg/m2 larger in the hypertensive groups com-
pared with the normotensive groups in both surveys.
Reported calcium intake was significantly lower in hyper-
tensive persons in NHANES III (P  .05) and marginally
lower in NHANES IV (P  .052). Intakes of sodium,
potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, protein, fat, carbohy-
drate, and alcohol did not differ between normal and
hypertensive participants in either survey.
Tables 3 and 4 show the nutrient intakes of participants
by category of BP: normal, systolic, diastolic, and both
systolic and diastolic hypertension. Participants with iso-
lated systolic hypertension made up approximately 60% of
the hypertensive population, and this group was signifi-
cantly older than the normotensive and the other hyper-
tensive groups (Table 3). Compared with the normotensive
and isolated systolic hypertension groups, the diastolic
hypertension group was predominantly male (86%). The
diastolic hypertension­only and the combined hyperten-
sion groups were more likely to be of non-Hispanic Afri-
can American ethnicity and to have higher BMI.
Very importantly, the pattern of significantly lower
mineral intake (potassium  calcium  magnesium)
emerged as unique to persons with isolated systolic hy-
pertension in both NHANES III (Table 3) and NHANES
IV (Table 4). This pattern was not observed among the
diastolic and combined hypertension groups. Consistent
with a dietary pattern of deficiencies rather than excesses,
the isolated systolic hypertension group also exhibited
significantly lower intakes of energy, protein, carbohy-
drate, fat, and fiber in NHANES III. Lower intakes of
energy and carbohydrate were also evident in NHANES
IV.
Of note, dietary sodium intake was also significantly
lower in both NHANES III and IV in persons with isolated
systolic hypertension compared with the normotensive
participants (3257 mg/day v 3686 mg/day, NHANES III;
3171 mg/day v 3584 mg/day, NHANES IV). Sodium
intake was significantly higher in the group with isolated
diastolic hypertension compared with the normotensive
group (4298 mg/day v 3584 mg/day, NHANES IV). Par-
ticipants with both elevated systolic and diastolic pres-
sures exhibited a nutritional pattern similar to those with
normal BP. The BMI was significantly greater in the
groups with diastolic hypertension and combined systolic
and diastolic hypertension compared with the normoten-
sive and isolated systolic hypertension groups (NHANES
IV).
When adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, alcohol,
and energy intake, the significant reductions in the com-
bined mineral variable (potassium, calcium, and magne-
sium intakes) persisted in the NHANES IV cohort of
participants with isolated systolic hypertension (data not
shown). In NHANES III, the multivariate adjustment
eliminated the significantly lower calcium intake. The
adjustment for age accounted for the major impact on
calcium intake in the isolated systolic hypertension partic-
ipants. Of the macronutrient differences observed in the
initial analysis, the lower fiber intake remained significant
for the isolated systolic hypertension participants in the
NHANES III cohort after adjusting for potential con-
founding variables (data not shown).
Discussion
This parallel analysis of nutrient intake and BP status from
the two most recent NHANES databases of the National
Center for Health Statistics supports a variety of previous
observations related to diet and BP regulation. In addition,
it provides a potentially critical new insight regarding the
sodium­BP relationship. Our analyses confirm once again
that inadequate mineral intake (calcium, potassium, and
magnesium) is the dietary pattern that best predicts ele-
vated BP in persons at increased risk for cardiovascular
disease--those with isolated systolic hypertension. Fur-
thermore, the data indicate that this pattern has persisted
across three decades of federally sponsored NHANES
surveys and thus is clearly not simply a fleeting trend in
the United States. Instead, this observation represents a
consistent pattern of dietary intake, one characterized by
low intakes of dairy products, fruits, and vegetables.

MINERAL INTAKE AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE
potassium, and magnesium) and increased hypertension
risk for persons with isolated systolic hypertension has
continued in the presence of federal policy and guidelines
that, until very recently, emphasized excessive dietary
sodium chloride as the sole nutritional issue in preventing
and managing high BP.14 As first noted in the initial
NHANES analysis,1 and then by others,5,6 higher dietary
sodium intake is not associated with higher BP in cross-
sectional studies among American adults. Our data indi-
cate just the opposite for persons at greatest cardiovascular
risk, namely, those with isolated systolic hypertension.14
Sodium intake is lower for those with isolated systolic
hypertension compared with normotensive participants. In
fact, our data from NHANES I, III, and IV (1999 to 2000)
show that the hypertensive category (NHANES I) and
isolated systolic hypertensive category (NHANES III and
IV) have significantly lower sodium intakes compared
with normotensive participants. In contrast, individuals
with elevated diastolic BP who also had higher mean BMI
tended to report sodium intakes greater than those of
normotensive persons (P  .042, NHANES IV) and sig-
nificantly higher sodium intakes than those of individuals
with isolated systolic hypertension (data not shown).
The negative association of minerals (potassium, cal-
cium, magnesium) to isolated systolic hypertension did not
persist in the multivariate analyses controlling for poten-
tial confounding variables. Although age is a primary
factor influencing hypertensive states, there are one or
more characteristics of older study participants that cause
their BP to be higher. Diet could certainly be that factor in
part. This does not mean that mineral intakes are not
important. In fact, evidence from the DASH trial shows
that they are important for BP control.2,10 Because of our
sample size and statistical power, we could not stratify by
age, gender, or ethnicity. However, our three-category
approach for BP and stratification by these variables
would be beneficial in future work. Another finding among
those with isolated systolic hypertension, the lower fiber
intake remaining significant after controlling for potential
confounding variables, is compatible with the reported low
fruit and vegetable intakes by other researchers.2,9­11
To our knowledge, no published reports of the relation-
ship between nutrients or dietary patterns and BP status
have included analyses based on category of hypertension,
ie, systolic, diastolic, or the combination. Analysis by
these categories identified a new and potentially important
distinction among type of hypertension and dietary com-
ponents. In our analysis, dietary patterns differed signifi-
cantly among BP categories. The nutritional pattern of
lower intakes of all minerals including sodium and of
macronutrients is unique to persons with isolated systolic
hypertension. This group comprises approximately 60% of
the hypertensive population in our samples. In contrast,
persons with isolated diastolic hypertension demonstrate
essentially the reverse pattern compared with individuals
with isolated systolic hypertension.
The decision to analyze data by three BP categories
warrants further comment. National treatment guidelines
have encouraged treatment regimens tailored to treat iso-
lated systolic hypertension as a condition that is different,
at least in part, from that of elevated diastolic or mean
arterial pressure. In our analysis, breaking this latter cat-
egory into two groups (isolated diastolic hypertension and
combined hypertension groups) may have revealed new
insights. First, we are not aware of previous analyses of
observational databases that have assessed whether iso-
lated systolic hypertension is associated with a dietary
pattern that differs from that associated with increased
mean arterial pressure, as in isolated diastolic hyperten-
sion. Importantly, our findings from both NHANES III
and IV suggest that dietary patterns do vary by BP cate-
gory. Furthermore, they indicate that within the traditional
category of elevated mean arterial pressure, dietary pat-
terns may be distinguishable between patients with iso-
lated systolic versus those with both diastolic and systolic
BP elevations.
There are important interpretative limitations of this
type of analysis. The methods of documenting recent
dietary intake are subject to substantial bias, most com-
monly that of under-reporting intake of calories and se-
lected nutrients, specifically fat. That issue has been
documented for NHANES III.15 Our data, however, pro-
vide several worthwhile insights as to these posited limi-
tations in recall methods as they might apply to our
findings. First, with the categorization of the BP status,
BMI was significantly different among the groups. Those
with isolated systolic hypertension were leaner, with sig-
nificantly low mean BMI, and reported intake of fewer
calories. The diastolic and mixed hypertension groups had
higher mean BMI within a range generally regarded as
overweight. This pattern of reported intakes was associ-
ated with excess BMI. Thus, the differing dietary patterns
that we have observed do not appear to reflect under-
reporting and are consistent with the notion that systolic
hypertension is associated with a more normal BMI, older
age, and lower caloric and nutrient intake.
These findings, as they relate to the putative association
of dietary sodium intake to hypertension in the general
population, provide a new perspective that may contribute
to resolving the long-standing salt­BP issue.16 Approxi-
mately 60% of the participants identified as hypertensive
in both NHANES III and IV had isolated systolic hyper-
tension. In both surveys, these individuals reported signif-
icantly lower sodium intakes. Approximately 20% of
hypertensive participants in both NHANES III and IV had
isolated diastolic hypertension. In NHANES IV these par-
ticipants had higher sodium intakes than normotensive
persons. The same trend was apparent, although not sig-
nificant, in NHANES III.
These various percentages of BP categories are consis-
tent with the typical distributions of salt sensitivity re-
ported within the hypertensive population: ie, 60% to 70%
are salt resistant and 30% to 40% salt sensitive. Based on
our findings, the 60% of persons with newly diagnosed
267

isolated systolic hypertension are unlikely to be salt sen-
sitive, as their reported sodium intake is significantly less
than that of subjects with normal BP. In contrast, diastolic
hypertension with concurrent excess BMI may well reflect
salt sensitivity, as sodium intake tends to be higher in these
individuals than in normotensive persons and is signifi-
cantly higher than in those with isolated systolic hyper-
tension.
Although age, weight, ethnicity, and energy intake are
known confounders of the relationship between BP and
nutritional patterns, our analyses add another dimension to
this relationship. Recognition that the association between
specific nutrients or foods and BP status in adults is not
uniform across all categories of hypertension has both
research and policy implications. The decades-long debate
regarding higher sodium intake and increased hyperten-
sion risk may be partially resolvable. Our data indicate that
effects of sodium on BP are limited to those individuals
with isolated diastolic hypertension with its accompanying
higher BMI. Restricting sodium intake along with calories
may prove specifically effective for these at-risk individ-
uals. Randomized trials targeting this specific category of
patients with an intervention that limits both calories and
sodium intake are needed to test this hypothesis.
There is substantial collateral evidence that individuals
at greatest cardiovascular risk, namely, older persons with
systolic hypertension, will benefit from interventions that
emphasize a dietary pattern that ensures adequate mineral
consumption (calcium, potassium, and magnesium) re-
gardless of sodium intake. Analyses of the randomized
trials that have tested the BP effects of higher calcium or
mineral intake have shown that the impact is greater and
more consistent on systolic than on diastolic pressure.8,17
These results are compatible with our findings. A prime
example of a test of this hypothesis is the Dietary Ap-
proaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Trial.2 In the
initial report of that National Institutes of Health­funded
study, a diet rich in minerals from dairy foods, fruits, and
vegetables was found to be uniformly effective in lowering
BP across all population groups, including hypertensive
and normotensive individuals, and was independent of
age, gender, and ethnicity as well as changes in weight or
sodium intake.
In a subsequent report, the DASH diet combined with a
normal sodium intake was particularly effective in older
individuals with isolated systolic hypertension.18 Most
recently, Hajjar et al19 confirmed the specific impact on
age-related increases in systolic pressure of a mineral-rich
diet in their analysis of NHANES III. A limitation of
including patients with coronary heart disease and those
on special diets in our sample is that their inclusion may
have influenced both the dietary variables and the outcome
variable, the mean of the BP readings.
Several meta-analyses of the trials of sodium restriction
and BP have documented a heterogeneous effect on BP in
the general population.20­23 These analyses have typically
indicated that the impact of restricting dietary sodium on
BP is evident primarily in older persons with established
hypertension. An intervention effect independent of so-
dium restriction has been identified by several of these
analyses.20­22 Collectively, these findings of heterogeneity
and isolated effects in subpopulations are consistent with
our analysis of NHANES III and IV as well as analyses of
NHANES I and NHANES I follow-up1,4,24 and support
the emerging concept that the impact of diet on BP regu-
lation is not uniform across the adult population. Addi-
tional analyses of available databases and appropriately
structured randomized control trials will be critical to
assessing the clinical importance of the findings derived
from our concurrent analysis of NHANES III and IV.
In conclusion, our findings have several important
implications for the prevention and management of
hypertension and for future research initiatives. Clearly,
the development of hypertension management guide-
lines in the future should be tailored to individual
patients, as has generally been the approach with phar-
macologic management, and not applied uniformly
across all BP categories or groups at increased risk for
hypertension. Furthermore, the emphasis of national
nutrition policy on sodium restriction for hypertension
is not consistent with these findings, identified in the
federally funded NHANES databases, and warrants
careful scientific evaluation.
Dietary interventions that improve overall diet quality
by increasing the consumption of low-fat dairy foods,
fruits, and vegetables, such as the DASH diet, have the
greatest likelihood of improving BP status. The heteroge-
neity documented between BP status and nutrient intake in
this analysis likely accounts for a substantial portion of the
heterogeneous responses that have been observed in ran-
domized controlled trials of diet modification for BP man-
agement. Future intervention trials should address these
substantial differences in nutritional intakes based on hy-
pertension category, particularly systolic hypertension,
rather than presuming homogeneous effects of diet on
regulation of arterial pressure.
