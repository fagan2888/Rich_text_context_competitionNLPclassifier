Background and objectives: The prevalence of mineral metabolism abnormalities is almost universal in stage 5 chronic
kidney disease (CKD), but the presence of abnormalities in milder CKD is not well characterized.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Data on adults >20 yr of age from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey 2003­2004 (N  3949) were analyzed to determine the association between moderate declines in estimated
GFR (eGFR), calculated using the Modfication of Diet in Renal Disease formula, and serum intact parathyroid hormone
(iPTH) > 70 pg/ml.
Results: The geometric mean iPTH level was 39.3 pg/ml. The age-standardized prevalence of elevated iPTH was 8.2%, 19.3%,
and 38.3% for participants with eGFR > 60, 45 to 59, and 30 to 44 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively (P-trend < 0.001). After
adjustment for age; race/ethnicity; sex; menopausal status; education; income; cigarette smoking; alcohol consumption; body
mass index; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; vitamin D supplement use; total calorie and calcium intake; and serum calcium,
phosphorus, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels--and compared with their counterparts with an eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m2--the
prevalence ratios of elevated iPTH were 2.30 and 4.69 for participants with an eGFR of 45 to 59 and 30 to 44 ml/min/1.73 m2,
respectively (P-trend < 0.001). Serum phosphorus > 4.2 mg/dl and 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 17.6 ng/ml were more common at
lower eGFR levels. No association was present between lower eGFR and serum calcium < 9.4 mg/dl.
Conclusions: This study indicates that elevated iPTH levels are common among patients with moderate CKD.

Alterations in bone and mineral metabolism are
present in nearly all patients with stage 5 chronic
kidney disease (CKD) (1,2). Although severe os-
teodystrophy is less common in earlier stages of CKD, elevated
intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, considered one of
the earliest markers of abnormal bone mineral metabolism in
CKD, have been reported frequently in clinic-based studies of
patients with renal insufficiency (3­10). Also, even moderate
reductions in renal function have been associated with signifi-
cant increases in the risk of hip fracture (11,12). However, the
stage of CKD at which iPTH begins to increase and the risk
factors for elevated iPTH have not been well characterized (13).
To identify and manage metabolic bone abnormalities in the
context of CKD, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initia-
tive (K/DOQI) guidelines recommend routine measurement of
serum iPTH, phosphorous, and calcium levels (13). Among
patients with elevated iPTH above the target range, assessment
of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status and correction
of 25(OH)D insufficiency are recommended. In addition, di-
etary interventions, including reduced phosphorous consump-
tion, may be required. However, many patients find adherence
to such diets difficult (4,14,15). Therefore, phosphate binders
and calcitriol should be considered as adjunctive therapy
(16,17).
Despite these guidelines, knowledge of the epidemiology of
metabolic bone disease in the population with less severe CKD
remains limited (18,19). Given the large number of patients
with CKD, characterizing the burden of, and outcomes associ-
ated with, alterations in bone and mineral metabolism has
important clinical implications. Furthermore, studies of early
CKD are essential for preventing adverse outcomes caused by
longstanding untreated mineral metabolism alterations. To bet-
ter characterize the level of renal function at which markers of
metabolic bone disease become abnormal, we analyzed data on
estimated GFR (eGFR) and iPTH from the population-based
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
2003­2004. Because serum calcium, phosphate, and 25(OH)D

levels are associated with iPTH levels, we assessed the associ-
ation between these serum markers and eGFR in a secondary
analysis. In addition, factors associated with elevated iPTH
were determined.
Materials and Methods
NHANES 2003­2004 was a cross-sectional survey that included a
nationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
population of the United States. The procedures involved in this study
have been published in detail and are available online (20). Participants
were selected for enrollment by means of a stratified, multistage prob-
ability sampling strategy. Stages of selection included counties, blocks,
households, and persons within households. Overall, 4742 adults (20 yr
of age and older) completed both the interview and medical evaluation
components of the NHANES 2003­2004. After we excluded partici-
pants who were missing serum creatinine (n  287), had an eGFR  30
ml/min/1.73 m2 or were on dialysis (n  43), lacked iPTH measure-
ments (n  4), or lacked covariate data (n  459), 3949 participants were
available for analysis.
Study procedures in NHANES 2003­2004 consisted of an in-home
interview followed by a medical evaluation and blood sample collec-
tion at a mobile examination center. Of relevance to the current anal-
ysis, variables collected during the in-home interview included age,
race/ethnicity, sex, menopausal status (for women), cigarette smoking,
alcohol consumption, education, household income, and medical his-
tory. For the current analysis, race/ethnicity was defined as non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, and other. Infor-
mation regarding the use of vitamin D and calcium supplements in the
2 wk before the participants' study visits were obtained through ques-
tionnaires and pill bottle reviews.
The NHANES 2003­2004 examination procedures included measure-
ment of height, weight, and BP. Three BP measurements were taken
during the examination visit using a protocol adapted from the Amer-
ican Heart Association. On the basis of the average of the three mea-
surements, hypertension was diagnosed if any of the following condi-
tions was met: systolic BP  140 mmHg, diastolic  90 mmHg, or
self-reported current use of BP-lowering medication. Because fasting
plasma glucose level was available only from a subsample of partici-
pants, diabetes mellitus was defined as a self-report of a previous
diagnosis by a doctor or other healthcare provider while not pregnant,
along with current use of insulin and or oral hypoglycemic drugs.
During the medical examination, a 24-h dietary recall was conducted. A
second recall was conducted by telephone 3 to 10 d later. For the 3680
participants who completed both recalls, the average calorie and cal-
cium intake was used for analysis. Data from a single recall was used
for the remaining 269 participants who completed the first but not the
second diet recall. Total calcium intake (mg/d) was calculated as the
sum obtained through diet and supplementation.
Detailed descriptions of blood collection and processing are provided
in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Man-
ual. Serum iPTH was measured at the University of Washington on an
Elecsys 1010 autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany),
using an electrochemiluminescent process. To measure iPTH, this sec-
ond-generation method uses a biotinylated monoclonal PTH-specific
antibody and a monoclonal PTH-specific antibody labeled with a ru-
thenium complex to form a sandwich complex. This assay provides
measurements of iPTH within 10% of the Nichol's Allegro assay (21).
Three levels of control specimens were used to assess the quality of
each serum iPTH run. Coefficients of variation for serum iPTH re-
mained  10% throughout the study period. On the basis of the
cut-point for defining elevated iPTH among adults with stage 3 CKD
from the K/DOQI guidelines, elevated serum iPTH was defined as 
70 pg/ml (13). Serum calcium and phosphorus levels were measured
on the Synchron LX20 (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) . Serum cal-
cium was corrected for serum albumin using the formula: adjusted
calcium  measured calcium  [(4.0  serum albumin in g/dl)  0.8].
Serum 25(OH)D was quantified by RIA with a I125-labeled tracer, using
the DiaSorin (Saluggia, Italy) assay in a two-step procedure (22). Ele-
vated serum phosphorus was defined as values in the highest quartile
( 4.2 mg/dl), and low serum calcium and 25(OH)D were defined as
values in the lowest quartile ( 9.4 mg/dl and  17.6 ng/ml, respec-
tively).
Serum creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic method of
Jaffe. Serum creatinine measurements were consistent with the assays
used in the development of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
study equation, which was used to calculate eGFR (23).
Statistical Analyses
The overall age-standardized geometric mean serum iPTH and the
prevalence of iPTH  70 pg/ml were calculated and stratified by
participant characteristics. Standardization was performed to the age
distribution of the United States' adult population. Differences in age-
standardized means and proportions across categories were calculated
using linear and logistic regression models, respectively. Next, the
distribution of iPTH was plotted separately for non-Hispanic whites,
non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican-Americans, and for men and women.
To explore iPTH levels across a broad range of eGFR (i.e., from 30 to
150 ml/min/1.73 m2), we used restricted quadratic splines with knots
at eGFR levels of 60, 90, and 120 ml/min/1.73 m2. These splines were
generated using quantile regression models for the median and 75th
and 90th percentiles of iPTH after standardization to 60 yr of age and
the sex and race/ethnicity distribution of U.S. adults (51% women, 80%
non-Hispanic white, 12% non-Hispanic black, and 8% Mexican-Amer-
ican). Next, eGFR was categorized into three levels:  60, 45 to 59, and
30 to 44 ml/min/1.73 m2, and the age-standardized geometric mean
serum iPTH and age-standardized prevalence and multivariate-ad-
justed prevalence ratios of elevated serum iPTH were calculated by
eGFR level. Three sets of multivariate analyses were performed. Ini-
tially, the association of iPTH with eGFR was calculated after adjust-
ment for age, race/ethnicity, and sex. A subsequent model included
additional adjustment for menopausal status (for women), household
income, education, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass
index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vitamin D supplement use, and
total calorie and dietary calcium intake. A final model also included
adjustment for serum calcium, phosphorus, and 25(OH)D levels. Linear
trends across eGFR levels were calculated by including eGFR level as
an ordinal variable in the regression model. In secondary analyses,
age-standardized geometric mean serum calcium, phosphorus, and
25(OH)D levels, and prevalence and prevalence ratios of low serum
calcium, high serum phosphorus, and low 25(OH)D by level of eGFR
were calculated.
Finally, correlates of elevated serum iPTH were determined for the
overall population and separately among participants with and with-
out stage 3 CKD (i.e., eGFR of 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2) using preva-
lence ratios. Data were reanalyzed with elevated iPTH defined as levels
65 pg/ml, the upper limit of normal for the assay used in NHANES
2003­2004, with markedly similar results (data not shown). All data
management was performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC), and all analyses were weighted to the U.S. population using
SUDAAN 9.01 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC) after taking into account the multistage, complex survey design of
NHANES 2003­2004.

Results
The geometric mean serum iPTH level was 39.3 pg/ml (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 37.7, 40.8 pg/ml), and 9.6% of U.S.
adults had an elevated iPTH (Table 1). Levels of serum iPTH
were higher at older age and, after age-standardization, among
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans (compared with
non-Hispanic whites). Levels were also higher at progressively
higher body mass index levels and among participants with
hypertension. Also, after age-standardization, serum iPTH lev-
els were lower among former and current smokers (compared
with those who never smoked), those who consumed  2
drinks per day (compared with nondrinkers), and those who
took vitamin D supplements. Levels were also lower at higher
levels of calcium intake and at higher levels of serum calcium,
phosphorus, and 25(OH)D.
The distribution of serum iPTH for non-Hispanic whites,
non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican-Americans overlapped sub-
stantially (Figure 1). However, the median and 75th and 90th
percentiles of serum iPTH levels were higher among non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans compared with non-
Hispanic whites. Specifically, the median iPTH levels were 37,
43, and 42 pg/ml; the 75th percentiles were 50, 58, and 56
pg/ml; and the 90th percentiles were 65, 78, and 72 pg/ml
among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexi-
can-Americans, respectively. The entire iPTH distribution over-
lapped for men and women, and the median and 75th and 90th
percentiles were nearly identical (38, 51, and 69 pg/ml, respec-
tively, for men, and 39, 52, and 68 pg/ml, respectively, for
women; Figure 2).
Figure 3 displays the age, race/ethnicity, and sex standard-
ized median, and 75th and 90th percentiles of serum iPTH by
eGFR. The median serum iPTH was  50 pg/ml for eGFR
levels  60 ml/min/1.73 m2. However, iPTH was higher at
eGFR levels below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2; the median serum iPTH
was 40 pg/ml at an eGFR of 59 ml/min/1.73 m2, and was 70
pg/ml at 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. A similar pattern was observed
for the 75th and 90th percentiles of serum iPTH; levels were
stable between an eGFR of 150 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, with a
steep rise present at eGFR levels from 59 to 30 ml/min/1.73 m2.
Geometric mean serum iPTH and the age-adjusted preva-
lence of elevated serum iPTH  70 pg/ml was higher at lower
eGFR categories (Table 2). After adjustment for age, race/
ethnicity, and sex, and multivariate adjustment, the prevalence
ratios of elevated serum iPTH were progressively higher with
lower eGFR levels. No association was present between eGFR
and low serum calcium levels. There was a trend toward higher
prevalence of elevated serum phosphorus at lower eGFR levels,
both before and after multivariable adjustment. The prevalence
of 25(OH)D  17.6 ng/ml was higher at lower eGFR levels.
However, this association was no longer present after multi-
variate adjustment for serum iPTH, calcium, and phosphorus
levels.
Table 3 summarizes risk factors for elevated iPTH. After
adjustment for race/ethnicity and sex, older age was associated
with an elevated serum iPTH. After adjustment for age and sex,
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans were more likely
than non-Hispanic whites to have elevated serum iPTH. Fur-
thermore, after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, and sex,
obesity, hypertension, and low levels of serum calcium, 25(OH)D,
and eGFR were associated with elevated serum iPTH. Addi-
tionally, current smokers, compared to never smokers, and
participants who consumed  2 drinks of alcohol per day
versus nondrinkers, participants with higher dietary calcium
intakes, and those who took vitamin D supplements were less
likely to have elevated serum iPTH. These associations re-
mained present, albeit attenuated, after multivariate adjust-
ment. After multivariate adjustment, men were 1.55 (95% CI:
1.06, 2.27) times more likely than women to have elevated
serum iPTH. Of note, adjustment for serum calcium, phospho-
rus, and 25(OH)D reduced the prevalence ratio of elevated
serum iPTH for non-Hispanic blacks, compared with non-His-
panic whites, from 1.76 (95% CI: 1.31, 2.37) to 1.24 (95% CI: 0.94,
1.63). These results were consistent for persons with and with-
out stage 3 CKD (data not shown).
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate a strong association
between moderate CKD and a higher prevalence of elevated
serum iPTH levels in a large, nationally representative sample
of U.S. adults. The prevalence of elevated serum iPTH, defined
in the current study as  70 pg/ml, was higher at lower eGFR
levels. Given estimates that 15 to 16 million U.S. adults have an
eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, this finding may have far-
reaching public health significance for musculoskeletal and
cardiovascular outcomes in these individuals (24).
For the 2003 K/DOQI guidelines, an evidence review team
identified several studies, mostly with small sample sizes, of
the association between renal function, before the need for
dialysis treatment, and serum iPTH levels (13). More recently,
a graded association between lower eGFR and a higher preva-
lence of iPTH  65 pg/ml was reported among a moderate-size
population of patients (N  1814) recruited from clinical offices
in the United States and Canada and enrolled in the Study for
the Early Evaluation of Kidney Disease (25). The current study
extends previous findings to a large, nationally representative
sample of the U.S. population. In addition, independent pre-
dictors of elevated iPTH levels were identified in the study
presented here.
Non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans in this study
were more likely to have elevated iPTH compared with non-
Hispanic whites. This finding is consistent with a previous
study of patients with CKD that reported blacks to have higher
iPTH compared with nonblacks (26). Although a previous
study has reported higher dietary calcium intake among whites
compared with blacks in the United States, adjustment for
dietary calcium intake did not fully explain the higher preva-
lence of elevated iPTH among non-Hispanic blacks in this
study (27). On the basis of our data, lower serum 25(OH)D
levels appear to explain a substantial proportion of the higher
levels of elevated iPTH in non-Hispanic blacks. Interestingly,
Mexican-Americans in the current study also had higher iPTH
levels compared with non-Hispanic whites. Few data have been
published on iPTH levels among Mexican-Americans. Given
the strong association between elevated serum iPTH and health

outcomes and the high incidence of stage 5 CKD among non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans, correcting elevated
iPTH in these populations warrants attention.
Consistent with previous studies, we found an association
between current smoking and alcohol consumption and a lower
prevalence of elevated iPTH (28,29). It has been hypothesized
that smoking causes an increase in plasma ionized calcium or
chromogranin peptides and decreased bone formation, and that
there is a direct toxic effect of cigarette smoke on parathyroid
cells (29,30). Also, alcohol consumption has been shown in vitro
as well as in two human studies to reduce osteoblast activity
(31­33). Further research is needed to understand the mecha-
nisms underlying the associations of cigarette smoking and
alcohol consumption with lower levels of iPTH.
The 2003 K/DOQI guidelines recommend routine measure-
ment of 25(OH)D levels in all patients with CKD and iPTH
levels above the target range, and treatment with vitamin D2
(ergocalciferol) supplementation if serum 25(OH)D levels are 
30 ng/ml. This recommendation is based on the observation
that reductions in 25(OH)D, the substrate for renal production
of 1,25(OH)2
vitamin D, are associated with compensatory in-
creases in serum iPTH levels in individuals with normal renal
function. When the concentration of 25(OH)D exceeds 30 ng/
ml, vitamin D supplementation no longer decreases serum
iPTH levels (34). Therefore, 25(OH)D deficiency may aggravate
elevations in serum iPTH in CKD, and the prevention of vita-
min D deficiency may reduce the frequency and severity of
secondary hyperparathyroidism. The majority of the adults
with reduced eGFR in this study had 25(OH)D levels  30
ng/ml, highlighting the need for measuring vitamin D levels in
CKD.
The data presented here also support a role for 25(OH)D
deficiency in the etiology of elevated iPTH in CKD. For exam-
ple, black race and obesity are recognized risk factors for
25(OH)D deficiency. Blacks have a markedly increased risk of
25(OH)D deficiency, largely as a result of the decreased ability
of pigmented skin to synthesize vitamin D3
after exposure to
sunlight (35). Multiple studies have demonstrated that obesity
is associated with lower 25(OH)D levels and higher PTH levels
(36­38). In our study, adjustment for 25(OH)D levels attenu-
ated markedly, but did not fully explain, the associations be-
tween these risk factors and elevated PTH levels.
Data from experimental models suggest that iPTH has direct
trophic effects on myocardial myocytes and interstitial fibro-
blasts (39,40). Importantly, higher serum iPTH levels in the
context of stage 5 CKD have been associated with increased
cardiovascular disease and mortality (41). Furthermore, a rela-
tionship between abnormal mineral metabolism and vascular
health has been reported in previous epidemiologic studies of
the general and stage 5 CKD populations (42). Abnormalities in
mineral metabolism may lead to calcification of soft tissues and
vascular tissue. Schulz and colleagues described an association
between rates of spinal bone loss and aortic calcification in
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (43). Also, Braun
and colleagues reported a correlation between lower bone mass
and higher coronary artery calcium (r  0.47, P  0.05) among
a group of dialysis patients (44). London and colleagues de-

scribed a strong association between arterial calcification, as-
sessed by ultrasonography, adynamic bone disease, and re-
duced bone remodeling in hemodialysis patients (45).
Low serum calcium and 25(OH)D and high serum phospho-
rus levels are common among patients with ESRD. Fewer data
have been published on the association between these abnor-
malities across the full range of eGFR (46). In the current study,
there was no association between serum calcium and eGFR. In
contrast, high serum phosphorus was more common at lower
eGFR levels. Previous studies have reported this association
and suggested that elevated phosphorus may be responsible for
the increased serum iPTH levels seen in stage 3 CKD (47). This
is a difficult area to study, because high serum iPTH increases
urinary phosphorus excretion. This was observed in the current
study: Participants with higher serum iPTH had lower serum
phosphorus levels. Nonetheless, a strong association between
eGFR and elevated serum iPTH remained present after adjust-
ment for serum calcium, phosphorus, and 25(OH)D levels.
There are several potential explanations for this finding. Be-
cause high serum iPTH increases urinary phosphorus excre-
tion, adjustment for serum phosphorus may not fully capture
the etiology of elevated iPTH. Serum levels of 1,25(OH)2
vita-
min D are likely to be reduced in participants with decreased
eGFR, because of reductions in nephron mass and 1--hydrox-
ylase activity. Deficiency in 1,25(OH)2
vitamin D promotes
parathyroid gland hyperplasia and increased PTH synthesis
(48). Also, the accumulation of iPTH fragments occurs in par-
ticipants with CKD (7). NHANES 2003­2004 did not have data
on 1,25(OH)2
D or PTH fragments precluding its investigation
in the current study.
Additional limitations of the current study include its cross-
sectional design. Prospective data are needed to estimate the

increases in serum iPTH levels because kidney function de-
creases with age. Another limitation is there were too few
participants with stage 4 CKD (i.e. eGFR: 15 to 29 ml/min/1.73
m2; n  35) to obtain valid levels of serum iPTH for this group.
In addition, the MDRD study equation, which we used to
calculate eGFR, is not as accurate in estimating GFR  60
ml/min/1.73 m2. Despite these limitations, the current study
maintains several strengths. NHANES 2003­2004 included a
large nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with a
broad spectrum of eGFR. In addition, non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican-Americans were oversampled, permitting reliable es-
timates in these population subgroups. Also, this study had a
broad collection of data including serum levels of iPTH, cal-
cium, phosphorus, and 25(OH)D. Furthermore, this study is the
first to identify risk factors for elevated iPTH, including low
calcium intake and obesity. These data were collected using
standardized protocols with rigorous quality control procedures.
In summary, using a sample of the general US population,
the current study provides a description of the prevalence of
elevated serum iPTH levels across a broad spectrum of kidney
function. Although serum iPTH levels were similar at eGFR
levels  60 ml/min/1.73 m2, a steep increase in serum iPTH
levels and the prevalence of serum iPTH  70 mg/ml was
present at eGFR levels of 59 to 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. This asso-
ciation was independent of dietary intake of calcium and serum
levels of calcium, phosphorus, and 25(OH)D. Given its associ-
ation with adverse outcomes in CKD, reducing serum iPTH
levels may be an important goal for improving quality of life
and preventing adverse health outcomes.
