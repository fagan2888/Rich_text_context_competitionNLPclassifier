When Physicians Counsel About Stress:
Results of a National Study
The prevalence of stress in primary care is high;
60% to 80% of visits may have a stress-related
component.1 Over the past 5 years, 44% of
Americans have reported an increase in psychological
stress.2 Stress is associated with more office visits and
disease, but little is known about stress management
counseling in primary care.3,4 Our study objective was
to examine the rates of stress management counseling
by US primary care physicians and to identify associ-
ated factors.
Methods. We obtained data from the 2006-2009 Na-
tional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), a
cross-sectional, multistaged, stratified sampling survey
of randomly selected, office-based physicians in the United
States from 2006 through 2009; information was avail-
able on an aggregate of 123 192 office visits to 5105 phy-
sicians (average response rate, 60.4%).5 We examined of-
fice visits, which included stress management counseling
provided by a primary care physician. Stress manage-
ment was defined as "information intended to help pa-
tients reduce stress through exercise, biofeedback, yoga,
etc" and included physician counseling at the visit and
"referrals to other health professionals for the purposes
of coping with stress."5 Our final sample consisted of
34 065 visits to 1263 physicians.
We conducted weighted analyses using SAS-callable
SUDAAN (version 10.0; SAS Institute Inc) to account for
the multistaged probability design, clustering of pa-
tients by physician, and oversampling of selected phy-
sician practices used by NAMCS. Potential correlates of
the provision of stress management counseling by
primary care physicians were (1) patient demographic
characteristics (age, sex, race, education, income, re-
gion, insurance status, and survey year) and (2) visit char-
acteristics (physician specialty, visit continuity, visit acu-
ity, number of chronic conditions, number of visits, visit
length, and diagnosis). Multivariable logistic regression
modeling identified those factors independently associ-
ated with physician counseling about stress.
Results. From 2006 through 2009, 1020 of 33 045 of-
fice visits (3%) included stress management counseling
by primary care physicians. Stress management coun-
seling was the least common type of counseling, com-
pared with counseling about nutrition (16.8%), physi-
cal activity (12.3%), weight reduction (6.3%), and tobacco
cessation (3.7%).
Adjusted multivariable analyses identified factors in-
dependently associated with physician counseling about
stress (Table). Older patients (age 65 years) were 39%
less likely to be counseled, while patients living in the
Northeast were 63% more likely to be counseled. Coun-
seling was 43% more likely for patients being seen for a
chronic problem flare-up. Counseling increased with the
number of chronic conditions. Physicians were more likely
to counsel patients with a depressive disorder. Finally,
counseling was associated with longer visits.
Comment. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to
examine factors associated with the provision of stress
management counseling by US primary care physicians
using a nationally representative sample. The low rate
of counseling points to potential missed opportunities,
suggesting that physician counseling about stress has not
been incorporated into primary care to the extent of other
types of counseling.
As the number of chronic conditions increased, so did
the receipt of stress counseling, especially in patients seen
for flare-ups of existing conditions. This is expected, since

patients with chronic diseases may experience in-
creased psychological stress. This care pattern implies that
counseling is being offered downstream, rather than as
a preventive measure, similar to physician counseling
about other therapeutic lifestyle changes.6
Of the conditions we studied, only depression was as-
sociated with counseling. The pervasiveness of depres-
sion in primary care has led to primary care being de-
scribed as the "hidden mental health system."7 In addition,
stress has been linked to both the initial diagnosis and
clinical course of depression.4 Our findings suggest that
while primary care physicians are aware of the links be-
tween stress and depression, the role that stress may play
in other nonmental health conditions may be less well
recognized.
We also found stress management counseling to be
associated with longer visits. This is consistent with other
types of counseling in primary care, and prior studies cite
lack of time as a key obstacle preventing counseling about
stress.1,8 Emerging models of primary care may address
physicians' concerns of time by using nonphysician health
coaches and health educators and using interventions such
as group sessions and communication by e-mail or tele-
phone, which may facilitate a greater incorporation of
counseling into clinical care.9
The low rate of counseling we found is not unique to
counseling about stress, since rates of physician coun-
seling are suboptimal across most therapeutic lifestyle in-
terventions.6 Physicians may recognize the need for pro-
viding counseling, but the low rate points to broader
delivery issues in primary care. In acknowledgment of
the already overburdened primary care physician, our
findings highlight the importance of restructuring pri-
mary care delivery and payment to emphasize and sup-
port a team-based approach.9 Through such innova-
tions, these emerging models may better incorporate
mental health services into clinical care and shift coun-
seling practices to earlier in the disease course, thereby
facilitating comanagement of psychosocial stress and dis-
ease and potentially improving health outcomes.

COMMENTS AND OPINIONS
Clinical Scores to Predict Streptococcal
Pharyngitis: Believers and Nonbelievers
One of the merits of Robert Centor is that in 1981,
he and his colleagues1 already showed that the
prevalence of group A -hemolytic strepto-
cocci (GAS) in the throat is 56% when the following 4
Centor criteria are present: fever of 38.5C or higher, ton-
sillar exudate, absence of cough, and enlarged cervical
glands. The validation of the Centor and McIsaac scores
by Fine et al2 showed comparable results.
Now, how is it possible that clinical scores have gained
poor traction in clinical practice? One reason is that other
