Epidemiology
In the United States, the prevalence of childhood and adoles-
cent overweight and obesity have trebled during the last three
decades (1,2). Although obesity is the state of having excess
body fat, it is typically clinically defined by BMI; one assump-
tion being that the relationship between BMI and body fatness
(%BF) is consistent across age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Recently,
however, there have been several reports (1,3­5) suggesting
that the BMI­%BF relationship is not uniform across race/
ethnic groups, e.g., Asians compared to Northern Europeans
(1,3,4) or between ethnic groups in the United States (6­8).
These findings question the applicability of the International
Obesity Task Force (IOTF) optimal BMI cut-points devel-
oped for use internationally (9). These BMI cut-points were
introduced in 2000 to provide optimal thresholds for thinness
among children and adolescents. The IOTF cut-points were
calibrated to be equivalent to BMI at age 18 years and were
obtained by averaging data from six ethnically and racially
diverse countries: United States, Great Britain, Brazil, Hong
Kong, Netherlands, and Singapore (9).
Using data from a multi-ethnic sample of US adolescents
including non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black
(NHB), and Mexican-American (MA) adolescents from the
continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES 1999­2004), we describe the relation
ship between BMI and %BF using fractional polynomial
regression (10).
Methods and Procedures
We investigated the relationship between BMI and %BF in adolescents
representing three race/ethnic groups, using NHANES 1999­2004
data. The final sample included 5,622 participants, 12­20 years of age,
derived from an initial data set of 7,497 individuals in that age range;
361 participants were excluded due to missing BMI data, 1,034 due to
missing %BF data and another 480 whose self-identified race/ethnicity
was other than NHW, NHB, or MA.
Weight (kg) and height (m) were measured according to standard
protocols (11) and used to calculate BMI. BMI percentiles were calcu-
lated based on the 2000 sex-specific BMI-for-age growth charts from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. %BF was calculated using
data from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements (Hologic,
Bedford, MA), as described in detail elsewhere (12).
Analyses were conducted using STATA (Ver 11, College Station, TX),
PC-SAS (Ver 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and SUDAAN (Ver 9.03;
Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). The statistical
analysis used sample weights and multiple imputations according to the
technical documentation for the 1999­2004 dual-energy X-ray absorp-
tiometry multiple imputation data files (13). We performed both a first
order (FP1) and second order (FP2) fractional polynomial regression
using %BF as the response variable and BMI as the explanatory variable.
The fractional polynomial approach allows for modeling nonlinear asso-
ciations between %BF and BMI, adjusting for other covariates (10). The
model was also fitted with additional covariates to test for interactions,

Adiposity Is Not Equal in a Multi-Race/Ethnic
Adolescent Population: NHANES 1999­2004

BMI is the preferred measure of adiposity in adolescents. Recent evidence suggests that in adults the relationship
between BMI and adiposity can vary by age and race/ethnicity. We investigated the relationship between BMI and
percent body fat (%BF) in a large multi-ethnic, nationally representative sample of US adolescents (National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES, 1999­2004). BMI was calculated; %BF was derived from dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry data and compared to BMI among adolescents from three groups: non-Hispanic white (NHW),
non-Hispanic black (NHB), and Mexican-American (MA). Fractional polynomials were used to model a new equation to
estimate %BF from a given BMI. MA boys weighed significantly less than either NHW or NHB boys, while only NHB
girls weighed significantly more than the other girls. Among the boys there were no differences in mean BMI, whereas
%BF differed significantly between all three groups. For the girls, both BMI and %BF differed significantly the groups
with MA girls having the highest %BF. The significant correlates for modeling %BF from BMI included gender, age,
race/ethnicity, weight, BMI

the final model explained 79% of the variance in %BF. NHB adolescents
had significantly lower %BF for BMI and MA had higher than NHW. Our results indicate that BMI may not be an
equivalent measure of %BF in a multi-ethnic population of US adolescents.

Epidemiology
e.g., we defined a dummy variable for sex to test for differences between
sex and BMI, and two dummy variables for race/ethnicity to test for inter-
actions between race/ethnicity and BMI. We used an  P level of 0.05 for
statistical significance; data are presented as means ± s.e.
Results
The final sample included 1,652 NHW, 1,902 NHB, and 2,068
MA adolescents 12­20 years of age, of which 41% were girls. The
sample was similarly distributed within the selected age range
with no significant age differences between race/ethnic groups
(mean 15.9 ± 0.1 year). Between 1999 and 2004, 12.5% (s.e. =
0.8) of the adolescent population comprising our sample were
97th percentile of BMI-for-age, 17.4% (s.e. = 1.0) 95th per-
centile and 34.9% (s.e. = 1.2) were 85th percentile. MA boys
weighed significantly less than their NHW and NHB counter-
parts (67.9 vs. 70.1 and 70.5kg, respectively; P < 0.05) and were
significantly shorter (P < 0.0001), although mean BMI did not
differ significantly (23.9 vs. 23.4 and 23.6). In contrast, NHB
girls weighed significantly more than either NHW or MA girls
(67.7 vs. 62.2 and 61.7kg, respectively; P < 0.001) and had higher
mean BMI (25.7 vs. 23.5 and 24.4; P < 0.02). %BF differed signifi-
cantly between the boys; NHB boys had the lowest %BF (21.8%)
compared to NHW (24.3%) and MA (25.6%) boys (P < 0.001),
and MA boys had higher levels compared to NHWs (P < 0.001).
Similarly, MA girls had the highest %BF (35.9%) compared to
either NHW (34.0%) or NHB (33.6%) (P < 0.001 for both).
We categorized our sample into three BMI groups using
the IOTF cut-points, i.e., <25.0kg/m2 (normal weight), 25.0­
29.9kg/m2 (overweight) and 30.0kg/m2 (obese). For the boys,
we found significant race/ethnic differences in the mean %BF
in the normal weight and overweight categories: NHB boys had
significantly lower %BF than either NHW or MA boys in the
normal weight category (17.4% vs. 20.2% and 20.7%, respec-
tively; P < 0.001) and the overweight category (24.8% vs. 28.2%
and 28.8%; P < 0.001). In the obese category, MA boys had the
highest %BF (36.7%) with NHW (35.1%) and NHB (35.3%) lev-
els being comparable. For the girls, we found significant differ-
ences in mean %BF across all BMI categories. MA girls had the
highest %BF (32.1%) compared to either NHW (30.3%) or NHB
(28.1%) (P < 0.001) in the normal weight category, and in the
overweight category (38.6% vs. 37.8% and 35.9%, respectively;
P < 0.001). In the obese category, NHW girls had the highest
%BF (45.2%) compared to NHB (43.3%) or MA (44.3%) girls.
We performed both a FP1 and FP2 of %BF by BMI. Table 1
presents the  coefficients for the best-fit models for both the
FP1 and FP2 analyses, either including or excluding weight
and Figure 1 presents the final FP1 model. The significant
covariates in each model included: sex (boy/girl), race (NHW,
NHB, and MA), age (year), BMI, and weight (kg). The FP2
model explained the most variance in %BF (R2 = 0.794), mar-
ginally more than the FP1 model (R2 = 0.786). We selected to
use the FP1 model because of an apparent over-fitting of the
data using the FP2 model. Thus the final model included body
weight, and explained 79% of the variance in %BF. Excluding
body weight slightly reduced the R2 to 0.777. In the FP1 model,
NHB adolescents had significantly lower %BF for BMI, MA
had higher than NHW.

Discussion
Our primary goal was to investigate whether %BF was equiva-
lent at comparable BMI's across three race/ethnic groups of ado-
lescents in the United States. We used the IOTF cut-points for
BMI to identify which adolescents would be categorized normal
weight, overweight, or obese at age 18 years, based on their cur-
rent BMI and age. We found significant differences for %BF at
the same BMIs across race/ethnic groups, indicating that BMI is
not an equivalent measure of adiposity in multi-ethnic adoles-
cents groups. MA adolescents had, on average, higher %BF for a
given BMI compared to NHW and NHB had lower %BF.
Instead of using a multiple linear regression or quadratic
model to identify the significant independent correlates for
%BF from BMI as has been used in most other previous stud-
ies (5), we used a FP1 model to estimate %BF from BMI as
suggested by Royston and Sauerbrei (10). This type of equation
allows for modeling the nonlinearity of the data. The model
which explained the greatest variance (79%) in %BF included:
BMI, sex, age, weight, race/ethnicity.
Flegalet al.(14)exploredtheBMI-adiposityrelationshipusing
NHANES 1999­2004 data in children from 8 to 19 years of age.
In parallel with the current study, NHB children consistently
had lower levels of body fat within the same BMI categories than
either NHW or MA children. In contrast to the findings among
adolescents alone, there were no differences in %BF for BMI
betweenNHWandMA.Therewerenosignificantrace/ethnicity
differences observed in the prevalence of high %BF in the Flegal
study when the categories of high BMI-for-age (95th percen-
tile) and intermediate BMI-for-age (85th <95th percentile) were
used. In the normal BMI-for-age category (<85th percentile),
however, NHB children had significantly lower prevalence of
high %BF compared to NHW and MA children.
With much smaller samples, Ellis et al. conducted a series of
studies (15,16) comparing %BF levels in NHW, NHB, and MA
boys and girls, 3­18 years, using dual-energy X-ray absorpti-
ometry to quantify %BF. In line with the current study, Ellis
reported that MA boys had significantly higher %BF levels
than NHW boys and, generally, NHB boys had lower %BF
than NHW boys, after adjusting for body size (16) and that
MA girls also had higher levels of %BF compared to NHW
girls after adjusting for body size (15). Based on these stud-
ies, it was recommended that estimations of %BF should be
race/ethnic-specific. Together with the results from the current
study, it may be necessary to investigate whether or not BMI
cut-points should be different for each race/ethnic group to
capture differential risk of obesity-related consequences. The
implications for this, particularly when it comes to identifying
those most at risk may have serious consequences.
In conclusion, we present data which indicate that in a nation-
ally representative sample of adolescents, BMI does not repre-
sent the same degree of adiposity across race/ethnic groups.
