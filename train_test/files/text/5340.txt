Brief Background
Extrasensory perception (ESP) is a panhuman experience
observed since antiquity (May, Rubel, & Auerbach, 2014;
Zingrone & Alvarado, 2015). The inability to understand the
nature of the experience, based on prevailing zeitgeists and a
dualistic understanding of mind/consciousness (Marwaha &
May, 2015b), has led to ESP being interpreted as a paranor-
mal ability.
Acceptance and increased interest in the applied aspects
of ESP were evidenced by the U.S. government's funding of
a 23-year, US$20 million program from 1972 through 1995,
with defense contractors Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
International and Science Applications International
Corporation. The U.S. government established an in-house
effort to apply ESP to problems of national interest during
the Cold War. This effort is best known by the program's last
nickname, Star Gate. Practical examples showed that, if used
properly, ESP garnered limited, but sometimes critical, suc-
cesses in intelligence gathering during the Cold War (May,
Rubel, & Auerbach, 2014). Unlike traditional academic
research, the intelligence community was result-oriented: As
long as the data, when combined appropriately with other
assets, provided useful information, the data were considered
valid. For some researchers, this provides evidence enough
for the existence of ESP.Although it remains a logical impos-
sibility for many skeptics, for others, it is a logical possibility
(Corry, 2015). In the Star Gate program, research was carried
out in various aspects of ESP by investigating potential
mechanisms such as that contained in physics, neuroscience,
psychological factors, and fine tuning research protocols and
statistical applications for analysis of data. The results drawn
from formerly classified1 300 technical reports and experi-
mental data can briefly be summarized as follows: (a) There
is statistical evidence for an information transfer anomaly
that we currently do not understand, (b) the second law of
thermodynamics and the gradient of Shannon entropy are
among factors that may influence the information transfer,
and (c) the phenomenon so far resists training for excellence;
rather, it is observed to be an innate ability in some individu-
als (May & Marwaha, 2014). As the SRI meta-analysis has
shown, "At this time, there is no quantitative evidence to
support a training hypothesis," that is, training for remote
viewing ability is not effective (May, Utts, et al., 1989, p. 2).
In 1995, May, Utts, and Spottiswoode (1995/2014) coined
the term "anomalous cognition" (AC) to refer to ESP phe-
nomena. According to them, the earlier definitions of ESP

Rethinking Extrasensory Perception:
Toward a Multiphasic Model of
Precognition
Sonali Bhatt Marwaha1 and Edwin C. May1
Abstract
In this article, we define precognition as an atypical perceptual ability that allows the acquisition of non-inferential information
arising from a future point in spacetime. The Multiphasic Model of Precognition (MMPC) identifies two distinct phases: The
first is the physics domain, which addresses the question of retrocausation and how it is possible for information to traverse
from one spacetime point to another. We suggest that the solution might be found within entropic considerations. The
second is the neuroscience domain, which addresses the acquisition and interpretation of retrocausal signals. We propose
that this occurs across three stages: (a) perception of signals from an information carrier, based on psychophysical variability
in a putative signal transducer; (b) cortical processing of the signals, mediated by a cortical hyper-associative mechanism; and
(c) cognition, mediated by normal cognitive processes, leading to a response based on retrocausal information. The model is
comprehensive, brain-based, and provides a new direction for research requiring multidisciplinary expertise.

were not sufficient to either describe the observables or pro-
vide a working definition for experimental work. The "anom-
aly" in AC refers to our insufficient understanding of the
process of AC, rather than its validity. ESP/psi/psychic expe-
riences are the most popular terms as understood by the lay
community.
AC research, particularly in the last 30 years, has accumu-
lated sufficient evidence to establish the existence of infor-
mation transfer through processes that we are only now
beginning to understand. Although it is beyond the scope of
this article to provide a complete analysis of the substantial
amount of experimental and theoretical work that has been
carried out worldwide since the 1930s, research across labo-
ratories provides statistical evidence for an information
transfer anomaly. Table 1 shows the most relevant set of
meta-analyses of various experimental AC paradigms.
It is not our intention to provide irrefutable evidence of
AC; rather, we provide references from which this table was
generated, to demonstrate that a substantial experimental
database exists that meets the standards of critical scientific
methodology. The meta-analyses in Table 1 take into account
reasonable "file drawer" estimates (Iyengar & Greenhouse,
1988; Rosenthal, 1979; Scargle, 2000; Schonemann &
Scargle, 2008).
Beginning in the 1970s, the research paradigm shifted
from forced-choice studies to free-response methodologies.
Some of these gave the first laboratory evidence for free-
response precognition (PC) under strict laboratory condi-
tions. Researchers examined various internal noise reduction
methods such as dreaming (Krippner, Ullman, & Honorton,
1971, 1972) and the ganzfeld (Honorton & Harper, 1974).
Puthoff and Targ (1974) further modernized a concept from
early in the 20th century (Sinclair, 1930/2001; Warcollier,
1926-1927) of a form of free-response study, which they
called remote viewing (RV). The references above are not
meant to be exhaustive; rather, they provide a flavor of these
types of data.
In traditional remote viewing studies (Puthoff & Targ,
1974), an assistant randomly chooses a site within a 30-min
drive from the laboratory and drives to that location and
remains there for approximately 15 min. An experimenter
then asks a participant to provide a description in words
and drawings of a location that they would visit within an
hour. The experimenter and participant of course are blind
to that location. The assistant then returns to the laboratory
and escorts the participant back to the site as a form of
feedback. Blind, rank-order quantitative analysis that com-
pares each response to the set of selected targets is carried
out to assess the degree to which there is statistical evi-
dence for PC (see May & Marwaha, 2014, for methodolog-
ical details).
Precognition--The Only Form of ESP
We present a brief rationale for our assertion that PC is the
only form of ESP (Marwaha & May, in preparation). First,
we offer a formal definition of PC based on the proposed
model:
Precognition is an atypical perceptual ability that allows the
acquisition of non-inferential information arising from a future
point in spacetime.2

For two future points in spacetime, insufficient time has
elapsed between them to allow for any causal relationship.
Procedurally, in ESP experiments, it means that target
stimuli are randomly generated after data collection is
complete.
Clearly, PC has been substantially investigated and docu-
mented (e.g., Honorton & Ferrari, 1989) and all the prestim-
ulus response and presentiment studies in which the stimuli
are randomly generated post response (e.g., Mossbridge,
Tressoldi, & Utts, 2012). This list of studies, although not
exhaustive, nonetheless, does provide substantial evidence
for PC.
However, it might be argued that the substantial database
experiments including ganzfeld, remote viewing, and other
ESP studies wherein the target stimuli are available at the
time of data collection appear to provide a substantial set of
data that are not PC by definition. However, in these studies,
a participant may still have access to the target stimuli via
PC. Feedback--associating a given trial with a given stimu-
lus--regardless of to whom it is given and when, or even
stored in a computer, provides a future-oriented possible
source for the ESP data (May, Lantz, & Piantineda,
1996/2014). No matter how clever the protocol, it appears at
this point that it is difficult or, perhaps, impossible to close
the future PC door. Finally, a meta-analysis comparing PC
studies with clairvoyant ones from 1935 to 1997 found no
significant differences between them. The effect size for the
difference was 0.01 (Steinkamp, Milton, & Morris, 1998).
Thus, our assertion that PC is the only form of ESP stands
on solid ground so that it can serve as an axiom for the
Multiphasic Model of Precognition (MMPC).
The Fundamental Questions in Precognition
PC research examines the subjective experience of acquiring
information from a future spacetime point. The fascination
with this aspect of human cognition focused early research
on the experiencer and the resulting experience. However, as
researchers delved further into the problem, it became appar-
ent that the picture was far larger than just human experi-
ence. The PC experience was a manifestation of far more
fundamental questions--the nature of time, causality, and
information. Thus, PC research, in its essence, addresses the
fundamental problems of the direction of time, causality, and
information flow (Marwaha & May, 2015a; May & Marwaha,
2015b).
The most important and difficult questions in PC research
are when, where, and how this information transfer occurs
from a distant point in spacetime? Furthermore, what is the
information carrier, and what are its properties? Answers to
these questions will help determining in which sensory sys-
tem, if any, the carrier energy is being converted into electro-
chemical signals. What is the transmission rate (bits/symbol)
of the data, and what is its limit? At what point does the
apparent stochastic nature of the information occur: Is it at
the source, transmission, or at the detection point?
In addition, other questions include the following: Who
possesses PC ability and why? Why can we not train for
developing a PC ability? Confidence calling is problematic
generally; however, a recent statistical approach--figure-of-
merit--has shown promise (May, 2007). Why do we not see
stable central nervous system (CNS) correlates for PC? Why
may personality correlations appear more as a procedural
artifact rather than as something fundamental?
These and more questions have emerged in the 150 years
of research in this field. Developing a model with so many
blank spaces in the data is a challenging task; nevertheless,
we have enough to begin that process.
MMPC
As with advances in any field, new developments are based
on the historical past and current thinking. We acknowledge
the foundations--across disciplines--on which this model is
based. Before proceeding with the model, we first introduce
and clarify our temporal-based terminology.
Figure 1 divides time into three parts: past, present, and
future as viewed from a single reference frame. In this arti-
cle, we adopt terminology from the future-centered per-
spective (i.e., top half of Figure 1) because there is
considerable interest in physics whether it is possible to
influence the present by a future action. The term that is
widely used in physics for this concept is retrocausation
(RC; Sheehan, 2011). RC is the notion that an event in the
future can influence the present, and it is not that the pres-
ent can influence the past. We thus use the terms RC and RC
signals to refer to this temporal, information-centered per-
spective for putative signals that originated from a future
point in spacetime. The bottom half of Figure 1 shows a
present-time, person-centered perspective, which is PC. We
notice that it is impossible for the present to affect or change
the past.
Figure 1. The prefix retro means action or information from the
future affecting the present.

Defining the Problem Space
The MMPC is a signal-based, process-oriented model
designed to determine the causal mechanisms leading to the
experience of PC. As a starting point, we have formally
defined the problem space of PC by considering two phases.
Phase I falls exclusively within the physics domain (PD).
It addresses the question, "How is it possible that informa-
tion can go between two spacetime points and be used, espe-
cially if the two points are acausally separated?" It is related
to how information is carried from an external source, which
is distant in time and space, to the percipient.
Phase II falls entirely within the neuroscience domain
(ND)--internal to the human percipient. It addresses the
experiential part of the problem, that is, how the information
is acquired by a putative sensory system, how this informa-
tion is processed in the brain, and how it is expressed. We
define the acquiring mechanism as a transition between the
PD and ND.
Using vision as an analogy, Phase I consists of an electro-
magnetic (EM) carrier providing informational signals at the
speed of light. Photons strike the retina (i.e., transition
between PD and ND for vision), which converts the EM
energy into electrochemical signals that are processed by the
brain (Phase II).
These domains divide the problem space within which a
solution for the complex problem of PC can be addressed.
These further consist of multiple discrete stages that can be
examined independently. Intrinsic to this perspective is that
different processes are involved in each phase and at different
stages, which finally result in a conscious experience of PC.
The MMPC addresses both the PD and the ND by consid-
ering the well-established laws of the physical world and what
we currently know--and will know--about brain­behavior
relationships. Thus, the MMPC is a coherent assimilation of
existing concepts that we believe can lead to understanding the
process of PC--from the point of information origin to cogni-
tion. Although PC researchers have been examining both
domains, the importance of formally dividing the process into
two domains permits allocation of problems to their respective
disciplines. Thus, researchers need not step out of their area of
expertise, enabling them to address the questions and formu-
late experimental hypotheses within their domain of profi-
ciency.As we will see in the details below, each segment of the
total PC experience requires a different set of questions and
expertise. In doing so, it may be possible to obtain answers to
one segment, without knowing the details of another. For
instance, we may understand how the brain processes infor-
mation, but we may not know how information is carried
across spacetime until physicists are able to decipher that
problem. We now consider the two phases in detail.
Phase I: The Physics Domain
Phase I falls within the PD. As stated, it addresses the ques-
tion, "How is it possible for information to propagate between
two acausally separated points and be acted upon?" It is related
to how information is carried from an external source, which
is distant in time and space, to the percipient. Although the
details are beyond the scope of this article, we present a brief
overview of this domain, to indicate to the reader that there are
experimental and theoretical bases for the question of how
information is carried across spacetime, that is, from there
then to here now (for details, see May, 2011a, 2011b/2014,
2014; May & Depp, 2015; May & Lantz, 2010/2014; May &
Spottiswoode, 1994/2014; May, Spottiswoode, & Faith,
2000).
The primacy of entropy. As with any model development, we
first must consider what data the model must be capable of
explaining. Because some experiments show that the quality
of PC is significantly correlated with changes of entropy of
the target systems (May & Lantz, 2010/2014; May & Spot-
tiswoode, 1994/2014; May et al., 2000), we propose that
some aspect of entropy or its gradients will yield an under-
standing of the PD.
The concept of entropy arose from classical thermody-
namics. Although the mathematics of various theories rap-
idly becomes difficult, the conceptual framework is rather
straightforward. One approach is to think of entropy as a
measure of chaos or to the related idea of uncertainty. Ice, for
example, has much lower entropy than water. Why? Because
the molecules of water in liquid form are bouncing around in
a chaotic fashion, whereas in ice, these same molecules are
all lined in an ordered array we call a crystal. Also, in liquid
water, the position of a given molecule is very uncertain,
whereas in ice, the position of a molecule is far more certain
as it is trapped in a crystal and is not going anywhere (May
& Lantz, 2010/2014).
A related concept comes to us as the second law of ther-
modynamics, which states that for isolated systems, entropy
cannot decrease. Suppose you knock a glass (ordered sys-
tem) to the floor and it shatters (i.e., a transition from low
into higher entropy). Now imagine picking up the pieces,
placing them on the table, and then knocking them to the
floor again as a bunch. What happens? The second law of
thermodynamics tells us that the entropy can never decrease,
which is what must happen if the shattered pieces are to
assemble themselves into a glass when they hit the floor
(May & Lantz, 2010/2014).
A closely related term is Shannon entropy. Building on
the pioneering work of Leó Szilárd (1929/1972), Shannon
and Weaver (1949) developed what is now called the
information theory. This concept formalizes the intuitive
idea of information that there is more "information" in
rare events, such as winning the lottery, than in common
ones, such as taking a breath. Shannon and Weaver defined
the entropy for a given system as the weighted average of
the probability of occurrence of all possible events in the
system. Entropy, used in this sense, is defined as a mea-
sure of our uncertainty, or lack of information, about a
system.
Marwaha and May 5
In sensory systems, receptor cells are sensitive to incident
energy regardless of "meaning," which is ascribed as a later
cognitive function. Shannon entropy is also devoid of mean-
ing. Pixel analysis in photographs, for example, ignores any-
thing to do with cognitive features. One way to think about
this is that each pixel has no information from its neighbor-
ing pixels (Tononi, 2012). From this point of view, a photo-
graphofanuclearblastis,perhaps,nomoreShannon-entropic
than a photograph of a kitten; it all depends on the pixel
intensities, which were used to create the photographs (May
& Spottiswoode, 1994/2014).
One important clue for why entropy is so important for
PC was provided during the Star Gate program. During that
time, the team noticed that there was a class of operational
PC missions involving intelligence gathering or simulations
thereof, which appeared never to fail. These included under-
ground nuclear tests, stores of radioactive material, EM pulse
devices, static and dynamic rocket motor tests, and rocket
launchings, to name a few (seeMay & Lantz, 2010/2014, for
details). For example, Figure 2 shows the complete AC
response to a static rocket motor test.
Figure 3 shows a schematic drawing of the site and a
recent Google Earth photo of the site 35 years later. What the
participant labeled a "rain-making" machine is something
that is common on such tests. Water is sprayed on the motor
during the test to keep it from overheating. Figure 4 shows a
modern test firing for comparison. The important point of
this example is that the rocket motor was initially in a rela-
tively low entropy state prior to the ignition and a high
entropy state during the test.
One possible explanation might be that these target types
share a physical attribute; they all involve enormous expen-
ditures of energy in a short period. Of course, the first thing
that comes to mind is that somehow these short bursts radiate
energy in such a way that the CNS of the participants
responds accordingly--a traditional sensory explanation.
However, this cannot account for the numerous examples
when the remote viewing was carried out precognitively, that
is, before the actual event had occurred.
A second observation the model must cover is that there is
an apparent entropic limit to the quality of the PC data (May,
2011a, 2011b/2014). Currently, we do not understand
whether that limit is imposed at the source, transfer, or detec-
tion mechanism, or some combination of them.
The data of RC itself provide support for entropy being
the prime candidate for Phase I (seeMay & Marwaha,
2014). These data suggest that at the macroscopic level, it
is possible to obtain information from some non-inferential
event in the future. This, of course, violates the rules of
macroscopic causality and the profound understanding that

time moves in one direction only. Yet, at the microscopic
level (i.e., atoms, molecules), the equations of motion are
all symmetric in time. In other words, time could move for-
ward or backward, and the collisions of molecules stay the
same.
This apparent paradox has been resolved now for more
than a century. At the macroscopic level, time moves in one
direction as a consequence of the second law of thermody-
namics. This law has not yet been violated. It is beyond the
scope of this article to provide technical support of this state-
ment, but the textbooks of any mid-level collegiate course in
physics, thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics will pro-
vide the details.
The argument for entropy as a PD candidate can be sum-
marized as follows:
·
· the quality of RC data correlates significantly with
entropic gradients of the target stimuli;
·
· the second law of thermodynamics can account for the
apparent paradox of time between the microscopic
and macroscopic perspectives.
Entropy gradients have also been used extensively to
understand two traditional forms of information transfer--
visual and acoustic. In the realm of audio, for example, an
index of speech intelligibility is the cochlea-scaled entropy
(Stilp, Kiefte, Alexander, & Kluender, 2007). In addition,
spectral change, as measured by cochlea-scaled entropy, pre-
dicts speech intelligibility better than the information carried
by vowels or consonants in sentences (Fei & Loizou, 2012).
High Shannon entropy of musical phrases affects the uncer-
tainty of determining musical pitch (Hansen & Pearce, 2012).
In the visual arena, it appears that neuronal structures in the
CNS take advantage of statistical aspects of subareas of the
visual scene to enhance visual recognition (Gerhard,
Wichmann, & Bethge, 2013); that is, sensory representations
are adapted to the statistical regularities in sensory signals
and thereby incorporate knowledge about the outside world.
In addition, entropy masking of a visual stimulus is related to
learnability; that is, high entropic masks make it difficult to
understand visual stimuli (Delaigle, Devleeschouwer, Macq,
& Langendijk, 2002). These references concerning entropy
and the visual and auditory systems are not exhaustive and are

presented only as representative samples to illustrate the
importance of entropy considerations in the understanding of
the signal characteristics to the normal sensory systems.
Norwich (2005) provides a succinct summary of the tight
relationship between physical entropy and the sensory
systems:
With reference to two specific modalities of sensation, the taste
of saltiness of chloride salts, and the loudness of steady tones, it
is shown that the laws of sensation (logarithmic and power laws)
are expressions of the entropy per mole of the stimulus. That is,
the laws of sensation are linear functions of molar entropy. In
partial verification of this hypothesis, we are able to derive an
approximate value for the gas constant, a fundamental physical
constant, directly from psychophysical measurements. The
significance of our observation lies in the linking of the
phenomenon of "sensation" directly to a physical measure. It
suggests that if the laws of physics are universal, the laws of
sensation and perception are similarly universal. [Emphasis
added]. It also connects the sensation of a simple, steady physical
signal with the molecular structure of the signal: the greater the
number of microstates or complexions of the stimulus signal, the
greater the magnitude of the sensation (saltiness or loudness).
(Abstract)
Most of the sample articles cited above are based on labo-
ratory experiments. Because the known sensory systems
appear to be sensitive to entropic changes at their sensory
"front ends," we feel it is not a surprise to find PC too is
sensitive to entropic changes of the stimuli. As further sup-
port for proposing that the PD for PC will be understood in
terms of entropy, we describe one theoretical article on the
fundamental aspect of entropy.
Verlinde (2011) was able to derive the classical dynamic
equations of Newton including his famous equation for the
gravitational force between two particles from entropic con-
siderations only. These computations were carried out com-
pletely within the classical or semi-classical domains; that is,
neither quantum mechanics nor general relativity was neces-
sary for the calculations. He did develop the idea of an entro-
pic force. This entropic force is like all other forces in that it
is a spatial gradient of some potential. In addition, Verlinde
was able to derive, again from first principles and gradients
of entropy, the Einstein field equations of general relativity.
The important point here is the supremacy of entropy as a
physical concept. In fact, Verlinde goes so far to suggest that
it is time to retire gravity as one of the four known funda-
mental forces in that he shows that gravity itself is an emer-
gent property of the more fundamental aspects of entropy
and thermodynamics. Verlinde's work has spawned great
interest in the fundamental nature of entropy.
Final considerations for the physics domain. We have noted that
there is considerable experimental evidence that suggests
entropic gradients may be important in understanding the
PD; however, with regard to mechanisms, signal carriers,
and transducers, the evidence is circumstantial. Clearly,
more work is needed. For example, there is a critical test of
these ideas underway in 2013-2015 (May, Hawley, & Mar-
waha, in preparation). In that study, they treat thermody-
namic entropic gradients at physical targets (as opposed to
photographic targets) as an independent variable and the
quality of the resulting PC as a dependent variable. This
experiment will add valuable insights into Phase I.
Phase II: The Neuroscience Domain (ND)
Background. Since the early 1940s, numerous attempts have
been made to correlate laboratory-based PC performance
with individual differences in participants' personality and
attitudinal characteristics to identify the underlying pro-
cesses. Researchers have extensively explored various
dimensions, such as beliefs and attitudes, moods, states of
mind, and personality variables. Extraversion has been one
of the most widely explored dimensions of personality in
relation to ESP. In a meta-analysis of 60 independent stud-
ies examining extraversion­ESP relationship, Honorton,
Ferrari, and Bem (1998) found a small correlation (r = .09)
that was significant (z = 4.43, n = 2,963) mainly due to the
large n. Even that correlation was thought to arise only due
to the free-response data, in that extraverted participants did
better than introverted participants did. The correlations of
ESP with personality variables as reported are unstable in
that they have not shown to be effective in identifying peo-
ple with a PC ability, as they are not systematic, are not
easily replicable, and contain a confound in the data collec-
tion methodology. In our analysis, the participant pool is
biased toward extraverts, as most of the studies use self-
selected volunteers as participants. In addition, cognitive
processes such as memory and subliminal perception have
been examined for their relation to ESP (seeRao, 2011, for
overview).
As the Star Gate program was tasked for applications, the
need to develop an effective tool to identify people with good
PC ability was of paramount interest. In initial studies, the
Myers­Briggs Type Inventory, Q-sort (Block, 1961), and the
Personality Assessment System (Krauskopf & Saunders,
1994), which uses the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale as a
behavioral measure of personality, were investigated for
their potential use as screening tools (Humphrey, Lantz, &
Saunders, 1986; Lantz, 1987; Lantz & Kiernan, 1986; Lantz
& May, 1988; May, Luke, & James, 1994; Saunders & May,
1984; Trask, Lantz, Luke, & May, 1989). None of these
methods was predictive of PC ability; the general conclusion
was that the best technique for identifying people with PC
skills is assessing them on PC tasks. This notion is supported
in a meta-analysis of 309 forced-choice PC experiments by
Honorton and Ferrari (1989) who report "studies using sub-
jects selected on the basis of prior testing performance show
significantly larger effects than studies using unselected sub-
jects" (p. 281).

Neurophysiological studies using technologies of the day,
including electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencepha-
lography (MEG; May, Luke, & Frivold, 1988; May et al.,
1994; May, Luke, & Lantz, 1993; May, Luke, Trask, &
Frivold, 1989; Targ, May, Puthoff, Galin, & Ornstein, 1976;
Targ, Puthoff, & May, 1976), and functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging (fMRI; Moulton & Kosslyn, 2009) have been
used to investigate the cortical correlates of PC. To summa-
rize the results of May and associates, (a) there were no stable
concomitant neural activities that seemed to occur during the
point of time when PC was supposed to have occurred. As
understanding of the phenomena increased, they realized that
this was probably due to the fact that we could not determine
when exactly the participant had received the information that
he was providing (i.e., before or during the test situation); (b)
we were, and are, still not sure about the form of energy car-
rier for RC signals. This implies that we were, and are, essen-
tially searching for the proverbial needle in the haystack of
neural pathways. For starters, Persinger's (2015) extensive
studies with PC-abled participants have implicated the right
temporoparietal lobe as instrumental in their abilities.
As in the PD, we first must consider what data the ND of
the model must be capable of explaining. We begin, there-
fore, with the appropriate observables assumed true:
Specifically, PC ability is seen in varying levels of profi-
ciency across the population, and no stable CNS and psycho-
logical correlates aside from a performance-based measure
on a PC task have been observed.
Phase II of the model refers to the processes that occur
once the signals from any external source, including RC sig-
nals, have reached the percipient's CNS, and the processes
that occur from perception to cognition of that data. This
phase is primarily an implicit process. The MMPC decon-
structs this domain into three discrete but fluid stages: (a)
Stage 1--perception of RC signals from an energy carrier,
(b) Stage 2--cortical processing of RC signals, and (c)
Stage 3--cognition. One aspect of our model is that Stages
1 and 2 are critically different from normal perception in
PC, following which, in Stage 3, normal processing occurs
as it does for any other sensory input. Figure 5 illustrates the
process of PC.
Stage 1: Perception of retrocausal signals.An important ele-
ment in the process of PC is the presence of a signal trans-
ducer to serve as an interface between the incoming signals
and the processing of that data. For example, the visual
receptors in the retina are the transducers for signals from the
visible EM spectrum. We can keep the nature of a putative
PC channel an open question until we have a better under-
standing of the PD. Nevertheless, we can work under the
assumption that PC information is received and processed
internally in the same manner as are signals impinging on
other sensory systems. As the nature of the putative RC sig-
nal is presently unknown, we have to assume that it is differ-
ent from the normal thresholds perceived by us. This requires
us to consider a possible variation in the transducer and the
processing mechanisms.
Hypothesis of psychophysical variability in a signal trans-
ducer (Hypothesis 1.1).
This hypothesis poses that psychophysical variability both in
CNS extent and function can account for variation in the
reception of RC signals; that is, some individuals demon-
strate a PC ability, whereas others do not. Approximately 1%
of the general population possesses a natural remote viewing
ability (May, Utts, et al., 1989). As we have seen over 40
years of experimental work, PC ability is seen in varying lev-
els of proficiency across the population, much like the vary-
ing levels of music ability for example.
This hypothesis suggests that individuals with PC ability
are different from those without it at the level of sensory
input as follows: The RC signal is acquired by those with PC
ability due to a possible variation in a putative biological
transducer, which is the point where external signals are
transformed into biochemical/bioelectrical sensory signals
and transmitted to the cortical structures where cognition
occurs. These signals are connected and processed across
multiple cortical areas, which is part of Stage 2 of the MMPC
as described in the following section. The question of what
the transducer is will be determined by our understanding of
the PD. (We note that this is the only part of the ND that is
dependent on the PD. From Stage 2 onward, the ND is inde-
pendent of any PD considerations.)
This hypothesis is based on the fact that individual differ-
ences are the sine qua non of biological and psychological
development. However, as Kanai and Rees (2011, p. 231)
observe, "In the neuroscience of human behavior and cogni-
tion, inter-individual differences are often treated as a source
of `noise' and therefore discarded through averaging data
from a group of participants." Thus, examining the variations
in this "noise" is of utmost relevance for identifying the PC
ability in accordance with the MMPC.

Research in individual variations in the visual domain
lends theoretical support for this hypothesis. Tahmasebi et al.
(2012) report on the variability of functional organization
relative to brain anatomy. A two- to threefold inter-individual
variation in size of the visual cortex is seen in humans, a
variation that could lead to substantial difference in visual
ability. Similarly, variations in number of axons in the optic
nerve, number of retinal ganglion cells in a single eye, and
the density of photoreceptors in the retina are also seen
(Hofer, Carroll, Neitz, Neitz, & Williams, 2005; Kee, Koo,
Ji, & Kim, 1997; Quigley, Brown, Morrison, & Drance,
1990; Roorda & Williams, 1999; Wesner, Pokorny, Shevell,
& Smith, 1991), including the presence of tetrachromacy or
even pentachromacy (Neitz, Carroll, Yamauchi, Neitz, &
Williams, 2002; Neitz, Neitz, & Jacobs, 1993). Using a bat-
tery of tests that included orientation discrimination, wave-
length sensitivity, contrast sensitivity, vernier acuity,
direction-of-motion detection, and velocity discrimination,
Halpern, Andrews, and Purves (1999) found that there was
significant inter-individual difference in visual ability, which
could be the result of inter-individual variation in the amount
of neural circuitry devoted to vision. These variations in the
cortical structures and the retina--the visual system trans-
ducer--provide a basis for considering the presence of PC
ability and the individual differences seen in that ability.
As experimental results and theoretical considerations
have shown, the RC-signal carrier cannot be mediated by
EM waves (Targ, May, et al., 1976). Nevertheless, we open
this door slightly to permit the possibility of variations in the
traditional sensory transducers, in that perhaps CNS struc-
tures that are adjacent to expanded sensory sensitivity are
involved in the detection of RC signals. We emphasize that
we are not proposing, therefore, that PC is carried on any EM
wave regardless of its frequency.
The final processing of the RC signals thus obtained
occurs in the brain, just as the brain is the final frontier for
color perception. This leads us to Stage 2 of the ND.
Stage 2: Cortical processing of RC signals. Stage 2 of the model
involves the processing of RC signals received as hypothe-
sized in Stage 1.
Hypothesis of cortical hyper-associative mechanism
(Hypothesis 2.1).
Considering the possible variation in the nature of an RC
signal, we may assume that it has characteristics that are dif-
ferent from known signals, and thus propose that RC signals
are processed via a cross-modal mechanism leading to a PC
experience. We consider this notion by formulating the
hypothesis of cortical hyper-associative mechanism
(Hypothesis 2.1).
Cortical hyper-connectivity has recently been associated
with atypical perceptual abilities such as synesthesia
(Hänggi, Beeli, Oechslin, & Jäncke, 2008; Ramachandran &
Hubbard, 2001; Rouw & Scholte, 2007; Simner & Hubbard,
2013) and savant skills in autism (Wallace, Happé, & Giedd,
2009). Hence, we borrow the term hyper-associative mecha-
nism as used by Simner (2012) for describing the possible
underlying mechanisms for synesthesia. As Simner states,
[there may be] one of any number of [original emphasis] possible
neurological processes that might give rise to the "open channel"
between different brain regions, which allows sound to be
interpreted as colour, taste as touch, touch as smell, and so on. In
fact, this neutral term should cover not one of several possible
mechanisms, but rather, one or more of these possibilities . . .
Whether a functional connection is established by hyper-
connectivity, by disinhibited pathways, by other means, or
indeed, a combination of these, the outcome is the opening of a
communication between regions that would otherwise not
directly interact to produce a conscious experience in the
average person. (p. 25)
Considering the possibility of a similarity in underlying
mechanisms between synesthesia and the proposed internal
PC mechanism, in our view, the synesthete population may
be a good point to start for examining this hypothesis.
However, a crucial distinction between synesthesia and PC
experiences is that synesthetic experiences apparently may
occur in the absence of an external signal. As Sean Day (per-
sonal communication, 3 January, 2014) stated, "Synesthesia
does not convey information of any reality; it adds one or
more non-real perceptions to an initial inducing perception
which may (or may not) be based upon reality." PC experi-
ences, as we propose here, arise due to the presence of exter-
nal signals. Others have also claimed that synesthesia may
actually underpin ESP experiences (e.g., Alvarado, 1994;
Myers, 1903; Simmonds-Moore, 2010, 2014).
Further support for this hypothesis comes from a variety
of atypical perceptual abilities. For instance, Loui, Li,
Hohmann, and Schlaug (2011) showed that people with the
ability to recognize absolute pitch (AP) possess higher
white matter connectivity in temporal lobe regions respon-
sible for the perception and association of pitch. These
hyper-connected regions include the posterior superior and
middle temporal gyri in both left and right hemispheres.
AP possessors had significantly higher tract volume than
non-AP individuals. Bermudez and Zatorre (2009) suggest
that AP performance exists along a continuum. Ashwin,
Ashwin, Rhydderch, Howells, and Baron-Cohen (2009)
report that significantly enhanced perceptual functioning,
about 2.79 times better than the average, and attention to
detail, also known as eagle-eyed visual acuity, is seen in
some persons with autism spectrum conditions. The mech-
anism for this may be at the level of neural hyper-
excitation and is likely governed by factors that give rise to
normal variation in visual acuity in typically developing
individuals. They speculate that this may be due to atypi-
cally high numbers of foveal cone cells or to dopamine
receptors at the retinal or neural level (and perhaps
increased levels of dopamine in these areas), which may be
caused by hypomethylation.
10 SAGE Open
Such observations provide theoretical and experimental
support for the hypothesis in Stage 2 of the ND.As the exam-
ples above illustrate, individual variations in cortical struc-
ture and functioning give rise to atypical cognitions. By no
means are these considered "abnormal"; rather, they arise
from a complex mix of genetic, sensory, and cortical archi-
tecture, and personal experiences that go into making each
individual experience unique. Similarly, PC ability may also
be one such atypical experience. Thus, we hypothesize that
cortical hyper-associative mechanisms may permit the pro-
cessing of information acquired from a synesthesia-like cou-
pling to an extended sensory variability through a currently
unknown transducer, following which the implicitly acquired
data are further processed in the brain. Thus, there may be
variability at the point of sensory signal intake (for instance,
neurotransmitters at the retinal level; Hypothesis 1.1) and
structural variability at the processing level (Hypothesis 2.1).
As Sagiv, Ilbeigi, and Ben-Tal (2011) have stated with refer-
ence to synesthesia,
We speculate that a broad spectrum of human experiences must
involve some sort of synaesthesia-like cross activation. After all,
non-trivial mental function quite commonly requires the
integration of information across different domains of
perception, cognition, and action. (p. 88)
Simner (2012, p. 27) informs us that "synaesthetic sensa-
tions derive not only from sounds, touch, tastes, words, and
so on, but also from more unexpected sources, such as the act
of decision making, or very fine-grain motor movements, or
navigating social interactions, and so on."Sagiv et al. (2011)
have summarized the features of synesthesia: (a) It is present
in 4% of the general population, (b) it is induced automati-
cally, (c) there is permanence and regularity of synesthetic
experiences, (d) synesthetes take the experience for granted,
(e) the experience shares much in common with ordinary
perception, and (f) it may merely represent an augmentation
of normal propensities for cross-modal interactions. Pointing
to a genetic basis, Eagleman (2012) has found five families
with color-sequence synesthesia. Two of the best Star Gate
remote viewers have twins with similar abilities, and, on a
preliminary analysis, are synesthetes.
In summary of Stages 1 and 2, RC signals may be acquired
by an individual with PC ability, due to psychophysical vari-
ability in signal transducer (Hypothesis 1.1); these signals
are then processed in accordance with Stage 2. The cortical
hyper-associative mechanism (Hypothesis 2.1) takes advan-
tage of a possible increase in spectral range of EM and/or the
perception of the RC signals that the brain can process.
Further support for the hypotheses put forth for Stages 1
and 2 is found in experimental and applied research. Using
neuroprostheses, Thomson, Carra, and Nicolelis (2013)
report a study with rats where they augmented the normal
perceptual range to include the infrared EM spectrum, which
is well outside the rat photoreceptors'spectral sensitivity. Via
intracortical microstimulation, the rats were able to tran-
scend the limitation of perceiving only those stimuli that can
activate their bodies' native sensory transducers. This lends
experimental support to the possibility of perceiving an
extended EM spectrum as proposed by the MMPC. In addi-
tion, sensory substitution devices (SSDs), which aim to com-
pensate for the loss of a sensory modality, typically vision,
by converting information from the lost modality into stimuli
in a remaining modality, lend support to the possibilities pro-
posed in Stage 2. There is increasing speculation that SSD
perception is an artificially induced synesthesia (for exam-
ple, see Farina, 2013; Ward & Wright, 2014). As Proulx
(2010) points out, many forms of expertise depend on cross-
modal contingencies.
Stage 3: Cognition. Implicit learning is the normal means of
acquiring information. It is characterized by two critical fea-
tures: (a) It is an unconscious process, and (b) it yields
abstract knowledge.As Lewicki, Hill, and Czyzewska (1992)
state, " . . . the ability of the human cognitive system to non-
consciously acquire information is a general meta-theoretical
assumption of almost all of contemporary cognitive psychol-
ogy." They further state that the "final products of perception
(i.e., subjectively encoded meanings of stimuli) is function-
ally independent from the information-processing algorithms
and heuristics responsible for generating those subjective
meanings" (pp. 796-797). The role of implicit learning in PC
has been well documented (e.g., Bierman, 2005; Carpenter,
2012; Watt, 1998).
Following an extensive review of studies on PC and brain
waves, EEG and functional imaging correlates of PC and
presentiment, and cerebral lateralization and PC, Williams
and Roll (2008) concluded that there is considerable evi-
dence that similar brain processes are used in PC as for nor-
mal perception and behavior. Thus, in concurrence with
Williams and Roll, Tyrrell (1947), Roll (1966), and
Broughton (2006), we hypothesize that in Stage 3, cognition
occurs in the same manner as for other sensory inputs.
Influence of emotions, memory, thinking, decision making,
and so on occurs as it does for other non-PC activity for elic-
iting a PC response. Thus, we propose that in Stage 3, there
is no distinguishing characteristic that differentiates the cog-
nition of RC signals from that of normal sensory signals. RC
information is acted on by the regular psychological pro-
cesses and manifested through unconscious and conscious
means such as feelings, dreams, language, art, decisions, and
so on.
As stated in the introduction to this article, we strive to
keep what is known in physics, psychology, and neurosci-
ence as intact as possible. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
assume that the processes involved in cognition of signals
from normal sensory modalities will also be involved in the
cognition part of RC signals. We have indicated in Stages 1
and 2 of the ND of the model that high variability of senso-
rial systems connected with a synesthesia-like coupling to
Marwaha and May 11
other CNS structures may be the pathway of RC signals into
the CNS. Once there, the cognitive correlates of RC signals
may be indistinguishable from those of normal sensory sig-
nals. This would suggest that it might not be possible to
observe CNS correlates to PC inputs simply because they
would be indistinguishable from other CNS correlates. This
is particularly so because we are unable to determine what
signals to look for and unsure about when the RC signals
were received and processed by a transducer. For instance,
the percipient may have received them before being con-
nected to the EEG gear or placed into an fMRI scanner, or, a
day before or in the parking lot before entering the labora-
tory, or perhaps the signals may have such a short duration
that they are missed by the hardware.
From our current understanding, RC signals are generally
not robust and are difficult to detect. Moreover, they also
appear to be statistically non-stationary; that is, statistical
properties vary with regard to when they are measured.
Where that apparent non-stationary aspect arises is unknown;
however, there are only three possibilities--at the source, in
the transmission channel, or in the detection mechanism.
Therefore, the cognition resulting from PC is unreliable.
Normal psychological influences, such as memory forma-
tion, emotional overlays, lack of attention or intention, ill
health, effects of medications, and so on, will interfere with
PC response formation as they do with other forms of cogni-
tive activities (McMoneagle &May, 2004/2014).
Theorists such as Roll (1966) have proposed that PC
information comprises the percipient's own future memory
traces and that the effect of the external (ESP) stimulus is to
activate memory traces rather than supplying new ideas or
images. Irwin (1979), in his information processing model,
proposed that the PC-evoked memory information goes
through several stages of unconscious or preconscious pro-
cessing that will determine whether or not it emerges into
consciousness in much the same way that sensory informa-
tion would be processed. However, various aspects of mem-
ory in relation to PC have been examined, but there were no
significant relations between the two (Blackmore, 1980,
1981).
As PC is an unconscious process, we can assume that a
PC-abled person is privy to a wider spectrum of information
that he incorporates in his daily life. Thus, in our view, mem-
ory may not play a role in the process of PC as outlined in the
MMPC, but as a normal cognitive process that enhances or
inhibits recall of perceptions. In this sense, memory is as
important as it is for normal cognition and does not play an
instrumental role in the acquisition of RC signals. Thus,
unlike Roll's analysis, the MMPC states that the most crucial
aspect in the PC process is the physics domain, and PC
involves Stages 1 and 2 of the ND. The MMPC proposes that
once the information (PC stimulus--new information or
images) has been implicitly received, it is stored in the mem-
ory in the same way as is information to the other sensory
systems. It is retrieved when the need for it arises.
Figure 5 illustrates factors such as attention, emotions,
beliefs, memory, creativity, uncontrolled random thoughts,
intellectual decisions, linguistic influences, and so on (May
& Trask, 1988) that may interfere with PC responses as they
do for the other senses. In the parlance of PC protocols, they
are referred to as "overlays." Thus, in a normal protocol in a
PC session at our laboratory, a participant is asked to first
note down/illustrate the thoughts/images that are on the top
of the participant's mind before the session begins. In this
manner, the cognitive overlays--the personal memories--
are brought to the conscious level, and PC cognitions can be
recognized by the percipient as being distinct. In an experi-
mental situation, an experienced PC-abled individual can
determine information that is emerging from his own frame
of reference as compared with that which is from newly
acquired information.
Familiarity with certain varieties of objects is potentially
problematic. On one hand, it may make it easier for a partici-
pant to identify something for what it actually is; yet, on the
other hand, such familiarity invokes responses that arise
from that familiarity and not from PC information (i.e., fill-
ing in cognitive blanks) from previous experience and not
from data. Experienced participants utilize normal meta-cog-
nitive processes to provide further details about the target
stimulus. Thus, they may respond with two categories of data
from a distant spacetime event: (a) technical details derived
from PC and (b) information arising from technical knowl-
edge from the participant's own database of information.
However, a participant who is not familiar with a submarine,
for example, and its relevance for the task at hand, may not
pay attention to the information that is being received and
thus bypass it, much like inattentional blindness. It is also
true that participants will describe an unfamiliar scene by
referring to similar situations of which they are familiar. For
instance, in the examples given in Figures 2 to 4, the partici-
pant described a "rain-making machine." This person had no
experience with a rocket motor test or its associated equip-
ment, so she described the site in terms that were familiar to
her. These included a rain-making machine, a locomotive,
and tracks. What the participant labeled a "rain-making"
machine is something that is common on such rocket motor
tests. Water is sprayed on the motor during the test to keep it
from overheating (see Figure 4).
MMPC and Other Psi Models
Developments in recent years point to continued effort on the
part of theorists and experimenters to understand the com-
plex problem of psi. These data have given rise to competing
and complementary models such as observational theory
(Houtkooper, 1983, 2002) and physics without causality
(Shoup, 2006) based in quantum mechanics, the model of
pragmatic information (von Lucadou, 1995) based on a
quantum metaphor, consciousness-induced restoration of
time symmetry (Bierman, 2010), psychological models such
12 SAGE Open
as the activational model of psi (Vassy, 2007), and the first-
sight model (Carpenter, 2012). Although a detailed discus-
sion of these models in relation to the MMPC is beyond the
limited space for this article, a succinct explanation is illus-
trated in Table 2 wherein various models are placed in the
appropriate domains of the MMPC. This brief illustration
indicates that different models address specific problems in
different domains and stages of the total PC event.
Challenges Posed by the MMPC
The merit of this model rests in viewing the seemingly uni-
fied process of PC into the two distinct domains of physics
and neuroscience. We can identify some challenges that each
domain poses.
The primary challenges are seen in the PD. Physicists are
considering the possibility that the thermodynamic-derived
single direction of time's arrow might be reversed on local or
global scales (Sheehan, 2006). Various hypotheses, such as
the entropy model and quantum RC, are being investigated
(Plaga, 1997; Sheehan, 2006, 2011). The biggest challenge,
however, is determining the nature of an RCsignal carrier
that propagates backward in time.
Intrinsically dependent on the carrier is the nature of
RCsignal transducer that can convert the energy from the
carrier into a form that can be processed by the CNS. The
nature of the transducer can provide clues to its location, just
as the auditory receptors serve as a signal transducer for
audio signals that can be subsequently processed by the cen-
tral auditory system. Identifying the transducer in PC ability
may aid in exploring the physics domain for appropriate car-
riers and vice versa. Recent research has further identified
the integration of touch and sound signals at the secondary
stage of the auditory cortex (Foxe et al., 2002; Fu et al., 2003;
Kayser, Petkov, Augath, & Logothetis, 2005; Macaluso,
2006). This opens the door for considering a variety of pos-
sible signals that can be processed and perceived by the
human brain. Experimental evidence for EM or acoustic sig-
nals as possible carriers for PC has been ruled out (Puthoff,
Targ, & May, 1979; Targ, May, et al., 1976). However, the
MMPC allows us to consider these channels with regard to
their sensory CNS structures that may be optimized for
RCsignal detection.
The challenges in the ND are, comparatively, not as oner-
ous as in the PD. Having bifurcated the problem space, ND
experimenters need not concern themselves with the chal-
lenges posed in the PD. As outlined, the primary problem for
the ND is determining the nature of an RCsignal transducer
and its cortical connectivity. This, in itself, will lead to a
breakthrough in our understanding of the PD as well as the
ND.
The basic process outlined in the MMPC opens the door
for exploratory research, particularly for Stages 1 and 2 of
the ND, which require expertise from a host of specialties. It
is our sincere hope that experts from relevant disciplines
take up the challenges posed, and take PC research forward.
We strongly believe that there is no need for any further
evidential studies for PC--a task that has been fulfilled
amply and successfully by ESP researchers over more than
150 years.
Predictions Based on the MMPC
The task for the next phase in PC research is well laid out in
the structure of the MMPC. The two domains and three
stages provide guidelines for further research.
An experiment is currently underway to test the entropy
hypothesis put forth in the PD. Because of the supremacy of
entropy, the MMPC predicts that this experiment will show
better PC when target stimuli are demarked with higher
entropic gradients than those that do not (May et al., in prep-
aration). The PD section of the MMPC would predict a suc-
cessful outcome of this experiment; namely, that a burst of
thermodynamic entropy at a future remote site acts like a
flashlight in a dark room allowing the participant to have a
better understanding of what is at the target stimulus.
In our view, the stages outlined in the ND are stable com-
ponents of the model. Although we have proposed hypothe-
ses for each stage, there is substantial room for introducing
new and fine-tuned hypotheses within each stage.

Stage 1: Hypothesis of psychophysical variability in a sig-
nal transducer. This stage is primarily an exploratory one.
The crucial test for this hypothesis is that individuals with
known and tested PC ability should be examined for possible
variations in structure and range in existing sensory trans-
ducers. We predict that (1) these individuals will have struc-
tural variations in a sensory transducer, for example, as seen
in tetra- and pentachromats, and (2) they will be the outliers
in the range of sensory input processed. In essence, the focus
is on individual data and not on averaged normative data.
Determining the variations observed in PC-abled individ-
uals permits the screening of the general population for simi-
lar variations and testing them to see the degree to which
they possess PC ability.
Stage 2: Hypothesis of cortical hyper-associative mecha-
nism. Although this stage too is an exploratory one, it has
scope for greater predictability. The key issue for this stage,
as in the previous one, is mapping the cortical structure of
individuals with known PC ability--a relatively straightfor-
ward task. Furthermore, we have hypothesized that the
nature of the RC signal and Stage-1 considerations may
require cross-modal connectivity to process the signal. For
this, we have proposed a hyper-associative mechanism as
seen in synesthetes. This gives rise to two predictions: (a)
PC-abled persons will have some form of synesthesia--the
nature and type being a secondary line of investigation--as
observed in appropriate diagnostic technologies, and as
determined by standard synesthesia inventories, and (b)
known synesthetes will have PC ability as measured by stan-
dard precognition tests (seeMay, Marwaha, & Chaganti,
2011/2014, for protocol details).
As stated, Stage 3, cognition, is not instrumental to the
process of acquiring RC information, although it does influ-
ence when, how, and in what form the information is mani-
fested. As this stage is amenable to a wide variety of
considerations--from neuropsychological to personality--
we discuss just a few predictions:
1. The MMPC predicts that distinct CNS correlates in
functional technologies such as EEGs and fMRIs will
not be observed during the process of PC tasking
because (a) currently, we do not know what kind of
signal to look for, and hence what the concomitant
EEG would look like. (b) Due to the very nature of
PC, in principle, we cannot determine when/where
the RC signal was acquired. For example, as men-
tioned, the RC signal might be acquired by the par-
ticipant before he arrives at the laboratory. (c) Once
the signal has been acquired, it may be processed in
the same way as normal cognitions, thus making it
difficult to determine whether a visual image is aris-
ing out of an RC signal, or it is information acquired
through other sensory channels, or stored RC infor-
mation that is being expressed in a visual or verbal
form.
2. Although the literature indicates that extraversion cor-
relates with PC ability, the MMPC predicts that there
may be no fundamental personality correlates for PC
ability. Fundamentally, the existence of the hypothe-
sized PC transducers and the synesthetic ability and
possible multisensorial processing are independent of
personality type. However, the possibility of a similar
biology may contribute to a similar psychology; how-
ever, considering personality is also shaped by experi-
ence, there may be too many confounding factors to
permit a "precognitive-personality type."
3. This model predicts that training for acquiring a PC
ability would be ineffective, although training to use
the ability effectively, as in response style, identify-
ing and ignoring cognitive overlays, and so on may
be possible; this is similar to learning how to use an
instrument when one has the inherent musical ability.
The MMPC model considers the internal processes
more analogous to acuity in the visual system; that is,
certain aspects of visual perception can be trained,
but acuity cannot be improved by training.
4. The MMPC predicts that individuals with PC ability
may exhibit a high score on vividness of visual imag-
ery (Marks, 1973), reflecting their ability to translate
a pure RC signal into comprehensible cognitive con-
tent. However, this may not be instrumental for the
process of PC, as much as a consequence of the
underlying structures.
5. Finally, because there is an obvious variation among
individuals in converting implicit information into
cognitive awareness, the MMPC would predict that
individuals who are inherently better at the process
would also be better at PC. Because there are inde-
pendent measures of implicit learning, it renders this
as a testable element of an aspect of the MMPC
model.
The ND premise opens the door for genetic evaluation of
the PC-abled persons. The search is for the genetic basis of
the underlying variations, rather than a gene for PC per se.
In conclusion, according to the MMPC, PC is an atypical
perceptual ability that allows the acquisition of non-inferen-
tial information arising from a future point in spacetime.
The person-centric experience of PC is a manifestation
of the fundamental problem of information-centric RC
signals.
Examining the ND may yield information on the probable
bandwidth on which RC signals may be carried and the sen-
sory modalities that are involved. This may provide data for
the PD to explore to determine the nature of a possible RC
signal carrier. This opens the door to understanding the fun-
damental questions that the experience of PC has raised--the
nature of time, causality, and information. Indeed, this is an
enormous task, for which the MMPC provides the frame-
work for a research program.

2. Spacetime: In classical physics, space and time are consid-
ered separate things. Space is three-dimensional and can be
divided into a three-dimensional grid of cubes that describes the
Euclidean geometry familiar from high-school math class. Time
is one-dimensional in classical physics. Einstein's theory of spe-
cial relativity combines the three dimensions of space and one
dimension of time into a four-dimensional grid called "space-
time." Spacetime may be flat, in which case Euclidean geometry
describes the three space dimensions, or curved. In Einstein's
theory of general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy
in the universe determines the curvature of spacetime.
