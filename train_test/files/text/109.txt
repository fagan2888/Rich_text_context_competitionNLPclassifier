Research Question
This paper analyzes the proprietary trading behavior of German banks in the months
directly preceding and following the Lehman collapse in September 2008. We examine
banks' immediate reactions to the crisis as well as their responses to unconventional
monetary policy measures introduced shortly after - the introduction of full allotment
and the change in eligibility criteria for collateral in central bank refinancing operations.
The default of Lehman Brothers can be seen as a shock to the German banking system
that was both unexpected and exogenous, which makes this setting ideal for studying
banks' trading reactions. This paper answers two main research questions: First, is there
any evidence of fire sales of German banks after the Lehman collapse? Second, how did
banks react to the ECB's unconventional monetary policy measures taken shortly after?
Contribution
First, the paper contributes to the empirical literature on asset fire sales in distressed
times by analyzing the securities trading behavior of German banks around the Lehman
collapse using a unique highly detailed trade-level dataset. Second, the paper analyzes the
impact of the ECB's unconventional monetary policy measures on the trading behavior
of banks, which is so far lacking in the literature.
Results
The paper does not find any evidence of fire sales in the German banking sector after
the Lehman collapse. However, the price reactions point towards a tightening of market
liquidity. Interestingly, this seems to be driven mainly by trades in OTC markets, which
appear to be most vulnerable to adverse market conditions. Moreover, ECB-eligible assets
suffer less from tight market liquidity, indicating that unconventional monetary policy
measures had a stabilizing effect. There is evidence that banks increasingly invested
in narrow basket assets, pointing towards a flight to liquidity. The introduction of the
extended basket (assets that became eligible in the time between 22 October 2008 and 14
November 2008) resulted in large purchases of newly eligible assets. The results indicate
that the ECB's policy measures were an important driver of banks' trading decisions.
Trades reflected a portfolio rebalancing in response to the crisis and to subsequent policy
measures rather than distressed trading. Moreover, banks' trading behavior depended on
whether they were constrained with respect to their liquidity and capital positions, and
price reactions were mostly driven by constrained banks, as predicted by economic theory.

Abstract
Based on a detailed trade-level dataset, we analyze the proprietary trading behav-
ior of German banks in the months directly preceding and following the Lehman
collapse in September 2008. The default of Lehman Brothers was a shock to the
German banking system that was both unexpected and exogenous. We examine
banks' immediate reactions as well as their responses to unconventional monetary
policy measures introduced shortly after the event ­ the introduction of full allot-
ment and the change in eligibility criteria for collateral in central bank refinancing
operations. Our results show that market liquidity tightened after the Lehman col-
lapse but there is no evidence of fire sales in the German banking sector. Instead, we
observe a broad-based flight to liquidity. The European Central Bank's unconven-
tional monetary policy had a strong impact on banks' trading behavior by inducing
shifts towards eligible securities and reducing pressure on market liquidity. This
suggests that the ECB's measures contributed to stabilizing the financial system
after the Lehman collapse.

1 Introduction
Contagion effects through fire sale externalities were at the heart of the global financial
crisis. Market participants' trading behavior and the resulting contagion effects are said
to have amplified the rather modest losses in the US subprime sector and contributed to
the spread of the crisis on a global scale (Brunnermeier, 2009; Hellwig, 2009). In response
to these disturbances, many central banks resorted to unconventional measures in order to
contain the crisis. The effectiveness of these measures in reducing fire sales has, however,
hardly been assessed.
Therefore, this paper looks at German banks' proprietary trading to analyze how the
unconventional monetary policy measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) affected
banks' trading behavior after the Lehman collapse. The default of Lehman Brothers can
be seen as a shock to the German banking system that was both unexpected and exoge-
nous, which makes this setting ideal for studying banks' trading reactions. The shock
reduced banks' liquidity due to the drying-up of interbank markets (see, e. g., Abbassi,
Br¨
auning, Fecht, and Peydr´
o (2014); Abbassi, Fecht, and Tischer (2017)) and the drawing
of credit lines by special purpose vehicles. It also affected banks' solvency due to direct
losses from interbank exposures and negative returns on securities holdings. Both would
be expected to have raised the pressure for banks to conduct fire sales. However, uncon-
ventional monetary policy measures by the ECB ­ in particular, the full allotment policy
and the extension of the collateral framework ­ may have reduced the need for banks to
conduct fire sales and may have relaxed the pressure on funding and market liquidity.
With increased liquidity provision by the central bank, funding from private sources is
replaced by central bank funding, making liquidity shocks much less harmful.
Our analysis is based on a unique trade-level dataset for the German banking sector.
The paper answers two main research questions: First, is there any evidence of fire sales
of German banks after the Lehman collapse? And second, did banks' trading behavior
change after the ECB implemented unconventional monetary policy measures? The em-
ployed dataset covers all trades by all German banks in all assets that are eligible for
trade on a regulated market in the European Economic Area (EEA). Thus, it contains
a wide range of asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, derivatives and futures), including
the over-the-counter (OTC) transactions in these assets. This makes it possible to not
only distinguish between different asset classes but also between banks' securities trading
behavior in exchanges and OTC markets.
In order to assess the impact of unconventional monetary policy measures, we match
the data with the daily list of ECB-eligible assets and divide them up into narrow basket
assets, extended basket assets, never eligible bonds, and never eligible stocks.1 We also
group banks according to the significance of fire sale constraints, as predicted by economic
theory. Specifically, banks with a weak liquidity position and a low regulatory capital ratio
are more likely to conduct fire sales. We then study the investment behavior of banks
or bank groups in different eligibility classes around the Lehman crisis and the ECB's
unconventional monetary policy measures. In addition, we analyze price reactions at the
security level, depending on the securities' eligibility status and banks' trading behavior.
1Narrow basket assets are eligible for central bank transactions in normal times, including many
sovereign bonds. Extended basket assets became eligible with the extension of the ECB's Collateral
Basket on 22 October 2008. The other two groups never became eligible.
1
Our results suggest that the Lehman crisis did not trigger broad-based fire sales in the
German banking system. Instead, banks increasingly invested in narrow basket assets,
which points towards a flight to liquidity. In line with this interpretation, banks sold
never eligible bonds in response to the introduction of full allotment whereas the exten-
sion of the collateral basket induced large purchases of newly eligible assets. Hence, the
results indicate that the monetary policy measures were an important driver of banks'
trading decisions. Trades reflected a portfolio rebalancing in response to the crisis and to
monetary policy measures rather than distressed selling. The eligibility of securities had
a strong impact on banks' trading behavior. Interestingly, with the support of central
bank liquidity, German banks on the whole acted as market liquidity providers during the
2008 crisis.2
However, looking at the prices of selling transactions, we find evidence of tight market
liquidity, especially directly after the collapse of Lehman. Interestingly, this seems to have
been driven mainly by trades in OTC markets. As expected, tight market liquidity does
not affect eligible assets to the same extent. Hence, through their effect on the eligibility
of securities, unconventional monetary policy measures mitigated the pressure on market
liquidity. These results support the view that the ECB's policy measures contributed to
stabilizing the financial system after the Lehman collapse.
We also find that there is a heterogeneity across bank groups. Relatively illiquid banks
invest in narrow basket assets and sell ineligible bonds, trying to improve their liquidity
positions. By contrast, relatively liquid banks invest in extended basket assets and stocks,
allowing them to collect higher returns. Weakly capitalized banks move into riskier bonds,
which may be evidence of risk-shifting. In line with economic theory, the tightening of
market liquidity after the Lehman collapse appears to have been largely driven by banks
constrained by liquidity or capital. Hence, it seems that the fire sale mechanism did,
indeed, exist in the German banking sector after the Lehman collapse. However, it was
muted by monetary policy responses.
Despite of the importance attached to fire sale externalities in the recent crisis, em-
pirical evidence is scarce. There are a number of papers analyzing low frequency balance
sheet data, such as De Haan and Van den Ende (2013) and Boyson, Helwege, and Jindra
(2014). De Haan and Van den Ende (2013) employ monthly balance sheet data for seven-
teen large Dutch banks and find evidence of fire sales, triggered by liquidity constraints.
Boyson et al. (2014) use quarterly balance sheet data for US banks, investment banks,
and hedge funds and do not find any evidence of liquidity-driven fire sales. Other papers
have used data on mutual funds. For example, Coval and Stafford (2007) show that even
in the pre-crisis period outflows from investment funds could create price pressure in se-
curities held in common by distressed funds. Manconi, Massa, and Yasuda (2012) find
that the trading behavior of institutional investors facing liquidity constraints may lead
to a propagation of distress to other asset classes, in this case from securitized bonds to
corporate bonds. Finally, Ellul, Jotikasthira, and Lundblad (2011) provide evidence of fire
sales in the insurance sector in response to regulatory constraints becoming binding after
a shock to the companies' capital. Even less is known about the effects of unconventional
monetary policy on banks' trading behavior.3 Our paper contributes to this literature by
2See De Roure (2016) for an analysis of the purchase prices of ECB-eligible securities, which shows
that banks' trading behavior induced a price premium in eligible assets.
3Acharya and Steffen (2015) analyze the impact of the unconventional longer-term refinancing opera-
2
providing evidence on German banks' securities trading after the Lehman shock and by
explicitly focusing on how monetary policy measures affect banks' trading behavior.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical background and
the data. Section 3 presents the empirical specifications as well as the aggregate results
for all banks, analyzing trading volumes first and then transaction prices. In Section 4,
we allow for heterogeneous bank reactions and distinguish between different bank groups
according to their liquidity and capital positions, again considering trading volumes and
transaction prices. Section 5 contains the conclusion.
2 Theoretical Background and Data
2.1 The Fire Sale Mechanism
In theory, contagion through fire sale externalities works as follows. In response to a shock
to the value of assets or a sudden withdrawal of liabilities, banks may be forced to sell
assets if a liquidity or leverage constraint becomes binding. Given the forced nature of the
sales, prices might deviate from fundamental values in the presence of financial frictions.
Therefore, distress sales of assets may depress market prices, which may then feed back
into the banking sector through common exposures. If banks holding the same assets
have to recognize distressed prices on their balance sheets, they might have to sell assets
as well, leading to an expansion of the crisis (see, e. g., Allen and Gale (2004); Cifuentes,
Ferrucci, and Shin (2005); Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009)).4
Hence, the occurrence and intensity of fire sales in response to a shock hinge on banks
being constrained. The first is a liquidity constraint. If banks are unable to refinance a
part of their balance sheet, they are forced to sell assets to generate the liquidity needed
to repay the debt (the classical Diamond and Dybvig (1983) case, see also Allen and Gale
(2000) and Allen and Gale (2004)). Margin calls could have a similar effect. The less
liquidity a bank has beforehand, the stronger the reaction is expected to be. The second
is a leverage constraint. If banks experience losses, e. g. due to failing counterparties after
Lehman's bankruptcy, this could result in a lack of regulatory capital, inducing asset sales
to "free up" regulatory capital (Cifuentes et al. (2005)). As long as the assets sold have
regulatory risk weights above zero, this relaxes the pressure on capital. Sales are most
likely to occur at banks that already had low regulatory capital ratios to begin with.
These banks will also find it harder to absorb higher costs for refinancing liabilities (e. g.,
increasing haircuts) during a period of stress.5 Given these theories about bank behavior,
we expect that banks with less liquidity and less capital are more prone to sell assets
tions in 2011 and 2012 on bank exposures, but they do not focus on the immediate central bank measures
in the aftermath of the crisis. Hildebrand, Rocholl, and Schulz (2012) analyze bank investments after
the financial crisis but are not able to disentangle the effects of the Lehman default and the subsequent
central bank policy measures due to the quarterly frequency of their data.
4Hellwig (2009) argues that price effects were reinforced by mark-to-market accounting. However, the
role of mark-to-market pricing has been questioned by Laux and Leuz (2010) who note that fire sale
prices do not necessarily have to be recognized on the balance sheet. According to Gorton and Metrick
(2012), fire sales can also occur in the shadow banking sector and spill over to the regulated sector.
5 Adrian and Shin (2010, 2014) show that financial institutions may target a specific ratio of value-at-
risk to equity, making leverage procyclical. This could also give rise to fire sales. However, as they show,
such behavior can be found empirically for US broker dealers, in particular.

following the shock from Lehman's bankruptcy.
2.2 The Role of Eligibility
Trading behavior is expected to differ across different types of securities. When it comes
to liquidity, the most important characteristic of an asset is its employability in repo
transactions. By "repoing" an asset, a bank can obtain funds without having to sell the
asset on the market. Therefore, we classify our assets according to their eligibility for
ECB refinancing operations. Assets that were not eligible at any point in 2008 (mostly
stocks, investment funds, certificates, options, bonds) are labeled "never eligible assets".
Assets that were eligible before the ECB's collateral extension on 22 October 2008 or
after 14 November 2008 are the "narrow basket assets," and those that became eligible
in the meantime are the "extended basket assets."6 The never eligible assets are rather
heterogeneous. Therefore, we further split the never eligible assets into "never eligible
bonds" that were never eligible in 2008 and "never eligible stocks", covering stocks, cer-
tificates, options and the like. Note that the narrow and the extended basket also consist
predominantly of bonds, which makes it easy to compare them with the group of "never
eligible bonds," whereas the "never eligible stocks" are very heterogeneous.
The assets most prone to being sold in response to a shock are the ineligible ones.
Unlike eligible assets, they cannot be used for repo transactions with the central bank
or in interbank markets. In order to improve the regulatory capital position, selling
ineligible assets seems also appropriate because their average risk weight is higher.7 The
models cited in the previous subsection do not introduce a central bank acting as a lender
of last resort. In a crisis, the lender of last resort should ­ provided there is sufficient
collateral ­ lend freely to solvent banks to keep the financial system liquid. After the
Lehman collapse in 2008, the European Central Bank (ECB) accomplished this task
mainly by introducing two unconventional monetary policy measures. First, it converted
the normal refinancing operations with banks to a fixed tender procedure on 8 October
(announcement) and 15 October (implementation). This implied that, given sufficient
collateral, banks could obtain as much liquidity as they wanted. Under this regime, the
only reason for short-term liquidity problems is a lack of eligible collateral. In order to
avoid a potential lack of collateral, the ECB extended the range of eligible collateral on
15 October (announcement) and 22 October (implementation) by reducing the rating
threshold to BBB-. Between 22 October and 14 November the ECB added assets to this
extended collateral basket, increasing the number of eligible assets from around 26,000
to more than 50,000 (see the lower right-hand graph of Figure 1). Consequently, the
outstanding volume of eligible collateral increased from around 9 trillion in 2007 to nearly
13 trillion in 2009 (European Central Bank (2013)). The extended basket assets were of
lower quality than the assets that had already been eligible before (the narrow basket
assets) and were consequently subject to a higher haircut. Still, after the extension of the
collateral basket, banks holding such assets could easily generate liquidity by using them
6We end the extended basket period on 14 November, as the number of eligible assets stops increasing
after this date (see the lower right-hand graph of Figure 1). It seems that the ECB's collateral policy
returned to normal after this point. Defining all newly eligible assets after 14 November until the end of
the sample period as "extended basket assets" does not change our results.
7For example, stocks and derivatives are typically subject to a 100% risk weight, while government
bonds, which are an important part of eligible assets, are often subject to a 0% risk weight.

in a repo transaction with the central bank without having to sell them, or any other
assets, to generate liquidity.
Full allotment should generally lead to an improvement in banks' liquidity positions,
which would, in turn, help to prevent liquidity-induced sales. As a result, investing in nar-
row basket assets became more attractive as they could be employed in repo transactions
to an unlimited extent from that point onwards. It could even generate an incentive to
create riskier narrow basket assets to be used in central bank transactions.8 In this way,
banks were able to increase their return on assets without affecting their liquidity posi-
tions. By contrast, extended basket assets were not yet attractive at this point in time.
Yet, when these assets became eligible, they were suddenly a great deal more attractive
because they then provided better liquidity services while yielding higher returns than
narrow basket assets at the same time. Given the higher haircut that extended basket
assets were subject to, liquidity-constrained banks may nevertheless have found narrow
basket assets more attractive. In contrast, ineligible assets became relatively unattractive
at this point, regardless of their relatively high returns. Therefore, one would expect that
banks sell ineligible assets in order to invest the proceeds in eligible assets. Especially
extended basket assets, which have a higher coupon than the narrow basket assets on
average, would offer a relatively attractive return while providing better liquidity services
than stocks or ineligible bonds.
2.3 Data
The analysis is based on several data sources. The main source is from the German Fed-
eral Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). This unique data set is based on reporting
requirements laid out in §9 of the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandels-
gesetz) under which all credit institutions and financial services institutions are required
to report to the BaFin all transactions of all securities and derivatives that are admitted
to being traded on an organized market in the EEA. The main objective of reporting is
to prevent insider trading. Therefore, the dataset contains detailed trade information,
i. e., the names of the trading bank and its counterparty, a dummy variable indicating
whether the bank's book was affected by the trade, the security identification number
ISIN, time and date of the trade as well as the transaction price, volume and currency
and the exchange at which the trade took place.9 In total, roughly 1.2 million securities
are potentially subject to reporting requirements. In our observation period from July
to November 2008, 149,900 different securities were traded by 1,527 banks, amounting to
around 24 million trades. In order to test for the representativeness of our data set, we
matched it with the Deutsche Bundesbank's Securities Holdings Statistics, which contain
detailed quarterly information on the securities holdings of all German banks in terms
of volume (i. e., in euro), excluding derivatives ((Amann, Baltzer, and Schrape, 2012)).
8In fact, this is what happened in the ABS market where some ABS were only created to be used as
central bank collateral ("originate to repo", see European Central Bank (2013)).
9If a transaction is conducted in OTC form, but the underlying security is permitted for trading in
an organized market in the EEA, it still has to be reported to BaFin. Only derivatives such as CDS and
interest rate swaps, which are exclusively traded in OTC form, are not subject to reporting requirements
under this reporting framework.
5
The securities trading data set captures 64% to 97%10 of the trading volume calculated
on the basis of the Securities Holdings Statistics from 2008. Note that our dataset also
contains around 80,000 securities that do not appear in the Securities Holdings Statistics,
which means they were traded and affected the banks' accounts but did not appear on
the banks' books at the end of the quarter.
We select our data sample in the following way. To begin with, we disregard all
trades with a price of zero and those where the trading bank is also the counterparty.
To control for bond issuance, we exclude all trades that take place before the issuance
date of the security and all trades by banks in their own bonds with a trade volume of
over 1 billion. In addition, we only look at trades that have an impact on a bank's own
account. Customer trades are, therefore, not included in the analysis. We do not include
any savings and cooperative banks, except for the ten largest ones of each bank group.
The small savings and cooperative banks delegate trading to their central institutions.
Thus, the informative value of the few trades contained in the data set is low. Banks that
already received state support before the Lehman crisis were not included in the data
sample either. Finally, we disregarded all banks that traded on fewer than 21 days in
2008. This procedure leaves us with 120 German banks (including foreign branches and
subsidiaries), which covers 95% of all trades included in the initial data set. These 120
banks represent 64% of total assets of the entire banking system in Germany. Further
information on banks regarding their liquidity and solvency positions is collected from the
Bundesbank's Monthly Balance Sheet Statistics.
The information on asset classes (stocks, government bonds, corporate bonds, cov-
ered bonds, CDOs, etc.) is obtained from the Centralised Securities Database (CSDB),
while daily data on the eligibility of securities for the European System of Central Banks
(ESCB) is obtained from the Eligible Assets Database (EADB). We restrict the sample
to the period from 1 July 2008 until 30 November 2008, which includes ten weeks before
and ten weeks after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008. While
the period before Lehman's demise was relatively calm, the financial crisis reached its
peak in the aftermath of the bankruptcy. Several European banks were on the brink of
failure and had to be rescued, while interbank markets around the world dried up. Since
banks were no longer able to refinance themselves, they were at risk of becoming illiquid
(see, e. g., Abbassi et al. (2014); Gabrieli and Georg (2014); Br¨
auning and Fecht (2012)).
For Germany, the demise of Lehman can be seen as an exogenous shock, since it was
not a result of the actions of German banks (see Brunnermeier (2009); Valukas (2010)),
but affected German banks' funding quite substantially (e. g., Hypo Real Estate lost its
funding and finally had to be nationalized). Therefore, the Lehman default provides an
ideal setting to study the reaction of banks to a large shock and to see whether such
shocks give rise to fire sales.
Figure 1 shows some descriptive characteristics of the dataset and illustrates how trad-
ing behavior was affected by both the crisis and monetary policy measures. In all of the
following figures, the three vertical red lines represent the following three events analyzed
here: first, the default of Lehman Brothers (15 September), second, the announcement of
10The exact number depends on the interpretation of assets that are not held by any bank in one quarter
in the Securities Holdings Statistics but by at least one bank in the following or preceding quarter. The
share captured is 64% if they are counted as traded and 97% if they are counted as newly issued or
matured.

full allotment (8 October), and, third, the introduction of the extended collateral basket
(22 October). In the upper left- and right-hand panels, we see the gross (buy plus sell)
trading volume per day across all banks in the four eligibility classes. The narrow basket
assets have the highest daily gross trading volume across the period under review. The
maximum value of 30 billion was reached on 8 October, i. e., the day that full allotment
was introduced and the interest rate cut was announced. The trade volume of shares and
other non-eligible assets is slightly lower, with an average daily value of around 10 billion.
Note that trading in both asset classes intensified around the Lehman collapse and the
policy interventions that followed. A different picture emerges for extended basket assets
and never eligible bonds, which are only rarely traded in quantities larger than 2 billion.
We observe an increase in trading activity in extended basket assets towards the end of
our sample period, starting in the week following the announcement to expand the col-
lateral framework on 15 October. While never eligible bonds were traded only in small
quantities prior to this expansion, values beyond 2 billion became more common after
the event. These aggregate trading patterns suggest that trading behavior changed due

to the events that took place in September and October 2008. A similar conclusion can
be drawn from the chart in the lower left-hand panel, which shows the number of banks
trading in an eligibility class on a given day. There are around 60 banks trading each
day with narrow basket assets and never eligible stocks. The number increased slightly
after the Lehman collapse and dropped again after the policy measures were launched in
October. Never eligible bonds are traded on a permanent basis by more than 30 banks
per day. For the extended basket assets, this number increased from 20 to nearly 30 after
the collateral extension. It thus seems that the collateral extension led to an increase in
trading activity regarding these assets. Finally, the chart on the lower right-hand side
shows the daily number of ESCB eligible assets. The narrow basket contained around
26,000 assets at the beginning of our sample. Then, with the introduction of the extended
basket, the number doubled; this meant that, towards the end of our sample period, the
ESCB accepted 52,000 assets as collateral.
3 Empirical Analysis ­ Aggregate Results
We now discuss the econometric model and our results, focusing on the German banking
system as a whole without distinguishing between different bank groups. Any net pur-
chases or sales of assets must, in the aggregate, be absorbed by market participants that
are not included in our sample, such as hedge funds, insurance companies or non-German
institutions. In Section 4, we will proceed to analyze trading behavior of different bank
groups to allow for a situation where distressed banks trade within the banking sector.
We will start by taking a look at trading volumes before considering transaction prices.
3.1 Empirical specification for trading volumes
In order to analyze the trading behavior of banks and their reactions to the Lehman
shock as well as the two policy measures, we construct a measure of net trading volumes,
capturing the daily net purchasing volume for each eligibility class at the bank level. We
focus on net trading volumes in order to measure the liquidity generated or absorbed
by the banks' trades. Let nj
i,t
count all trades of bank i on day t in eligibility class j.
We calculate the total volume of each trade nj
i,t
, tradej
nj
i,t
,i,t
, as the product of the price
(converted to euro using the end of day exchange rate from Bloomberg and divided by
100 in case of a bond) and the nominal value (for bonds) or the quantity (for stocks and
the like), counting purchases as positive and sales as negative. We then sum these trade
volumes over nj
ti,
and divide by the initial total assets of the bank as at June 2008, TAi

which gives us the weighted net purchasing volume of bank i in eligibility class j on day

The weighting by the initial total assets reduces the dominance of large banks and allows
us to depict the banking system as a whole.11 The weighted daily purchasing amount is
multiplied by 100 to get a percentage value. Further, note that we attribute the value
zero when a bank did not trade an asset class on a given day.
In the econometric analysis, we examine how banks' trading behavior changed in re-
sponse to the Lehman collapse as well as to unconventional monetary policy measures.
In the basic regression, the variable net buyj
i,t
is regressed on three event dummies. The
first is the default of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008, represented by the dummy
Lehmant
, which equals one from 15 September to 7 October. The second is the an-
nouncement of the full allotment policy on 8 October 2008, represented by the dummy
FAt
, which equals one from 8 October until 21 October. Note that we use the announce-
ment of full allotment rather than the implementation one week later as it was clear that
the full allotment policy would affect only narrow basket securities, which were the only
eligible securities at the time. So in order to take advantage of the full allotment pol-
icy, one would need narrow basket securities. The third event is on 22 October, when
the implementation of the extended collateral basket started. The corresponding dummy
variable extendedt
equals one from 22 October until the end of the sample period. Here,
we use the implementation date instead of the announcement date, the reason being that
the announcement itself did not specify which securities would become eligible. Conse-
quently, banks could not react in a targeted fashion until they saw which securities became
eligible following the implementation. Moreover, note that the new securities were added
to the eligibility list over several days so that the impact of the implementation could be
expected to happen gradually. In an unreported robustness check, we also use the an-
nouncement date as the relevant event. This does not affect our results qualitatively. All
regressions include bank fixed effects. The basic regression model then looks as follows:
net buyj
i,t
= i
+ 1
Lehmant
+ 2
FAt
+ 3
Extendedt
+ uj
i,t
, (2)
where j = narrow basket, extended basket, never eligible stocks, never eligible bonds
We will illustrate the regression results by constructing graphs of average trading
behavior. To this end, we cumulate the weighted amount over time so that net buycum,j
i,t
depicts the amount a bank has bought or sold in net terms in a certain eligibility class
between t0
(July 1, 2008) and time t, weighted by initial total assets:
net buycum,j

For the aggregate graphs, which show the German banking system's holdings (and thus
its net trade with the rest of the world), we take daily averages over all banks.
3.2 Results on trading volumes
Below, we discuss the regression results along with the graphical illustration. The main
results for the aggregate German banking system are given in Table 1 and depicted in
11We also show results for the unweighted variable in Figure A2 in the appendix.

Figure 2, which shows the aggregate cumulated net purchasing volume weighted by to-
tal assets (Equation (3) averaged across all banks) for the period from 1 July until 30
November 2008.12
In turn, we discuss the results for the four eligibility classes. The trading behavior in
narrow basket assets is depicted in the upper left-hand panel of Figure 2. On average,
German banks made net purchases of narrow basket assets during the sample period.
Between July and November 2008, German banks bought narrow basket assets worth 4%
of their balance sheet on average, with purchases accelerating sharply after the default
of Lehman Brothers. Between 15 September and 8 October, the average net balance
increased by nearly 2 percentage points (relative to total assets), implying that the daily
net purchasing volume in this period was far higher than before the Lehman collapse or
after the full allotment announcement. In the regressions (Table 1), this is reflected in a
highly significant and large coefficient of the Lehman dummy (see column 1). In contrast,
the coefficients of the two other dummy variables are not significantly different from
zero, meaning that net purchases returned to the pre-crisis trend. We do not observe
aggregate sales of narrow basket assets during the sample period. Hence, there is no
evidence of fire sales of narrow basket assets, especially not in the post-Lehman period
when money markets were most tense. Given that such assets could be used in central
bank transactions, it is not surprising that rather than selling assets into a distressed
market, they were reserved for repo transactions with the central bank.
Instead, the opposite occurred, namely that banks bought narrow basket assets on a
broad scale in this period. There are several potential reasons why banks would buy a
greater volume of narrow basket assets. First, supply-side factors may have been at play.
Since narrow basket assets are often government bonds, a higher issuance of government
debt securities ­ for which banks are usually important buyers ­ might be responsible for
the substantial increase in narrow basket holdings after Lehman. However, the issuance
of German government debt securities increased only slightly from 51 billion to 57 bil-
lion from the second to the third quarter of 2008. (Note also that the issuance volume
is planned one year in advance and finally determined one quarter before the actual is-
suance date.) Furthermore, an increased supply could stem from non-German financial
institutions or German non-banks. In this case, the massive increase after Lehman could
be interpreted as German banks acting as the provider of market liquidity for institutions
not included in our sample, which are conducting fire sales. Some evidence for this inter-
pretation can be found in Abbassi, Iyer, Peydr´
o, and Tous (2016) who show that German
banks invested mainly in assets of which the price had previously fallen. Second, demand-
side factors may have played a role. As narrow basket securities provide access to central
bank and interbank repo funding, they represent a valuable investment in the context
of a liquidity crisis.13 This is especially true as collateralized interbank markets became
increasingly popular in the crisis period (see, e. g., Mancini, Ranaldo, and Wrampelmeyer
(2016)), which have even stricter collateral requirements compared with the ECB (see
12Note that the graphs depict cumulated series so that the regressions refer to the first difference of
the graphs shown.
13Assuming that the Lehman shock reduced the liquidity of many financial assets and claims, another
underlying reason for the net purchase of narrow basket assets could be that banks tried to reestablish a
given liquidity level on the asset side of their balance sheet by buying more liquid assets as in Froot and
Stein (1998).

The figure shows the net (purchases ­ sales) euro trading volume of all 120 banks, weighted by each
bank's total assets as at June 2008, averaged per day and cumulated over days, for all assets grouped
by their ECB eligibility. Increases reflect an expansion in asset holdings while decreases represent net
sales. The graphs show the evolution of the trade balance of the German banking system with the rest
of the world. The red bars indicate from left to right: the default of Lehman Brothers (15 Sep), the
announcement of full allotment (8 Oct) and the introduction of the extended basket (22 Oct). Sources:

In the upper right-hand panel of Figure 2, we see the average net purchases of ex-
tended basket assets. Until after the announcement of full allotment, banks tended to be
net sellers of these securities on average. The numbers are small compared with narrow
14Instead of using cash, which would not directly increase the banks' liquidity, banks could tap the
following funding sources to finance the purchase of narrow basket assets: central bank liquidity via
repoed credit claims or asset-backed securities (some banks engaged in so-called "originate to repo"
activities, i. e., they originated ABS in the crisis with the sole purpose of using them as central bank
collateral, see European Central Bank (2013)) or sales of ineligible assets. In fact, Podlich (2016) shows
that distressed German banks sold roughly 60 billion worth ineligible assets in the fourth quarter of 2008,
using quarterly data from the Securities Holdings Statistics. Distressed banks are defined as banks which
received government support between 2007 and 2011. Not all those banks are in our sample, because we
exclude banks that received government support before our sample period begins.

basket assets as extended basket assets are traded infrequently. However, we see a small
selling tendency after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which intuitively makes sense
as these assets are, on average, less liquid and riskier. Most importantly, they did not
provide access to central bank liquidity until the collateral extension took effect. What
is more, banks started buying these assets on a large scale exactly on the date the collat-
eral extension was announced (15 September 2008). The regression results confirm the
graphical impression (see column 2 of Table 1). Net purchases are smaller in the post-
Lehman period than before but the difference is not statistically significant. However, we
see a positive and significant coefficient after the extension of the collateral basket, the
coefficient being much smaller than that for narrow basket assets, as expected.
It seems that the ESCB eligibility status made extended basket assets significantly
more attractive for banks. The reason is straightforward: From this point on, they could
be repoed for liquidity with the ECB so that buying these assets did not impair the
liquidity position of the bank. Furthermore, they had on average a higher coupon and
thus were more rewarding for banks to hold than, e. g., narrow basket securities. It thus
appears that banks were engaging in risk-shifting by collecting the coupon on riskier
assets but offloading part of the risk at the ECB. This complements the "carry trade"
finding of Acharya and Steffen (2015) who argue that banks borrowed from the ECB to
generate exposure to high-yield euro-peripheral countries (which, however, would be part
of the narrow basket). These results also help us interpret the findings on the narrow
basket assets. Given that eligibility appears to make an asset very attractive, it seems
plausible that banks were buying narrow basket assets to prop up their liquidity pool.
This trading behavior also changed banks' portfolio composition. Using the Securities
Holdings Statistics, which includes a quarterly snapshot of all securities held by German
banks, we see that relative to their total assets as at the end of June 2008, banks in our
sample increased their holdings of narrow basket assets by 2.7% between the second and
12
third quarter of 2008, and their holdings of extended basket assets by 341% between the
third and fourth quarter of 2008.15
The lower left-hand panel of Figure 2 illustrates the aggregate holdings of never eligible
bonds. As can be seen, banks invested in these bonds before the Lehman crisis but largely
ceased to do so once Lehman crashed. Banks became net sellers of never eligible bonds
after the FA announcement and also briefly after the extended basket implementation,
before purchases rise again towards the end of our sample. In the regressions this shows
up in a mildly significant negative coefficient in the full allotment period (column 3 of
Table 1). The results for never eligible stocks are less clear (lower right-hand graph of
Figure 2). This is not entirely surprising as this asset class consists mostly of stocks and
derivatives; these are often used by banks in the context of market making and hedging
activities, potentially making it hard to detect a particular trading strategy. Generally
speaking, banks sold these assets before the Lehman crisis and a remarkable downward
jump occurs at the time of the Lehman collapse, with banks selling 0.1% of their average
balance sheet total on average. This development resembles fire sale behavior, but is
reversed immediately and the same amount is repurchased between the Lehman event and
the full allotment period. The reactions to both policy measures were positive. Purchases
increased after full allotment was announced and the extended basket implemented. In
the regressions, only the coefficient of the full allotment dummy is statistically significant
and very large (column 3 of Table 1). The sharp increase in holdings immediately after
the FA announcement might indicate that banks were either increasingly willing to hold
riskier securities after being assured that they would have access to the central bank
liquidity (a demand effect) or that they purchased a large amount of assets because they
were supplied by other market participants.
These results are interesting as we see that trading reactions for bonds differ markedly
depending on the bonds' eligibility status. While banks buy bonds that can be used to
generate central bank liquidity, they tend to sell bonds that do not. From a liquidity
perspective, this seems reasonable as the only way to generate liquidity with ineligible
assets is to sell the assets. This complements the finding by Beber, Brandt, and Kavajecz
(2009), who study transactions in the European bond market and find that, compared
with normal times, the market liquidity of bonds becomes more important for the invest-
ment decision ­ relative to credit quality ­ during periods of distress. Note also that never
eligible bonds being sold off supports the hypothesis that the increased build-up of never
eligible stocks is supply-driven. As never eligible bonds can be regarded as the riskiest
of our bond classes, they are most similar to stocks or derivatives regarding risk charac-
teristics. If the increased holdings of these assets had been incited by a rise in demand
by banks for risky assets, we should have been able to observe an increase in holdings of
riskier bonds as well.
There are two potential factors that could bias our analysis. First, banks might sell
large quantities of assets at decreasing prices. This could mask large-scale sales in our
analysis as we are multiplying quantities and prices. In Figure A1 in the appendix, we
therefore show results using only the quantities without multiplying the prices. With the
15The initial holdings of extended basket assets are very low, which makes the increase in absolute
terms relatively small. Further note that the numbers are not directly comparable between the two
databases since maturing assets change total holdings in the Securities Holdings Statistics, but not in our
trading-based dataset.
13
exception of stocks, where banks, indeed, seem to have sold cheaper assets (or purchased
more expensive assets), the results are comparable to Figure 2. Note, however, that the
"never eligible stocks" also consist of all types of options and other derivatives, which
means that price differences between securities in sales and purchases can quickly arise
(for instance, a bank can sell options at low prices and hedge this by buying the underlying
securities, which are usually more costly). Moreover, by weighting the net purchases with
banks' total assets large-volume sales by big banks could potentially go unnoticed. We
therefore also show the results for unweighted net purchases (again, multiplying quantities
and prices) in Figure A2. Here too, the results for narrow and extended basket assets
are very similar to the results presented in Figure 2. For never eligible stocks, we find
that the size of banks has an impact, which is intuitive given that large and small banks
engage in derivative trading to different degrees. The results for never eligible bonds also
differ. In unweighted terms, banks sold never eligible bonds in substantial quantities on
balance, suggesting that these sales are attributable to large banks, in particular.
The regressions in Table 1 are conducted at bank level to identify the liquidity gen-
erated by banks' trading behavior at the individual bank level. It is also instructive to
consider the trading behavior at the individual security level and to check whether di-
vergent reactions can also be found with respect to an asset's eligibility status at that
disaggregated level. The regressions at the ISIN level confirm the results from the pre-
ceding analysis (see Table 2). Once again, we see a shift towards narrow basket assets
(starting after the Lehman collapse) and extended basket assets (after the introduction
of the extended basket). Moreover, never eligible bonds are sold, in particular after the
introduction of full allotment. Finally, we observe an overall shift into never eligible stocks
as before.

Summing up, we observe that banks were, on the whole, net buyers of assets during the
Lehman crisis. The eligibility of assets was a key determinant of the trading decisions of
14
banks, which tended to buy eligible assets and sell ineligible assets. This can be seen as a
reaction by banks to the tense liquidity situation following the Lehman bankruptcy when
interbank markets dried up and banks started hoarding liquidity (Acharya and Merrouche
(2013)). However, no evidence of large-scale aggregate fire sales by banks can be found
in any of the asset classes considered in the trading data. Therefore, we now turn to the
analysis of transaction prices.
3.3 Empirical specification for transaction prices
Even though the analysis of trading volumes provides no evidence of fire sale behavior,
there may nevertheless have been pressure on market liquidity after the Lehman collapse.
In a next step, we therefore take a look at the evolution of prices. More specifically, we
want to know whether banks' trading activity had an impact on security prices in the
time period under review. Our focus shifts from a bank-level to a security-level analysis.
In order to capture banks' aggregate trading behavior, we compute the daily net
purchasing volume across all banks for each ISIN k:16
net buyk,t
=
Nk,t

nk,t=1
tradenk,t,k,t
(4)
This variable represents the net volume of a particular asset traded with investors outside
of the German banking system. Insofar as these can be viewed as outside investors in the
spirit of Shleifer and Vishny (1992), price effects are most likely to be found in such trades.
The higher the selling volume to outside investors, the greater the effect on prices should
be. A similar approach can be found in Nyborg and ¨
Ostberg (2014) who correlate gross
trading volumes with price changes. As fire sale prices are associated with selling, we focus
exclusively on selling prices. Net trading volumes can vary considerably across individual
assets, and the ultimate price impact depends on an individual asset's liquidity features.
Consequently, a bias towards zero can arise if assets traded with outside investors in large
quantities are relatively liquid. We take logs of our explanatory variables for this reason.
As net buy can have positive and negative values, we use the log-modulus transformation
to preserve the sign and the zeros:
log(net buyk,t
) = sign(net buyk,t
)  log(1 + |net buyk,t
|) (5)
In addition, the selling price may be influenced by the size of the trade, quantitynk,t,k,t
.
In liquid markets, the quantity of a trade may not be of great significance. In times of
crisis, however, selling prices are likely to decrease with the size of the trade.
Hence, the basic regression establishes a link between selling prices and the quantity
of a trade, as well as the overall net purchasing volume for all banks, as defined above:
sell pricenk,t,i,k,t
= i
+ t
+ kp
+ log(quantitynk,t,k,t
) + log(net buyk,t
) + unk,t,i,k,t
(6)
16In this section, we focus only on bonds as this is the largest and most important asset class. Further,
the analysis uses a relatively homogeneous pool of assets with comparable prices.
15
We control for bank fixed effects i
, time fixed effects t
, and ISIN×period fixed
effects for the pre-Lehman, post-Lehman, full allotment and extended basket periods.
This allows us to control for any bank-specific and time-specific heterogeneity in prices.
Furthermore, the ISIN×period fixed effects estimate a base price for each asset in each
period. This is important as the underlying bonds are still relatively diverse so that the
time fixed effects cannot fully capture the exogenous shifts in asset prices for all assets
jointly. The main coefficient of interest is , relating to the overall net purchasing volume
of a given asset. If  is positive, the correlation between banks' net purchasing volume
with outside investors and the prices that banks face in asset sales is positive. This would
mean that a higher selling volume to outside investors (i. e., a negative net purchasing
volume) is associated with lower selling prices, which suggests price pressure or fire sale
price behavior.
A favorable aspect of our dataset is that we can distinguish OTC transactions from
trades at exchanges. To obtain a better understanding of the often mentioned yet rarely
studied OTC markets, we carry out separate calculations of net trading volumes for
OTC transactions and exchange transactions and compare the results of the two types
of trades. Given that exchanges and OTC markets are fundamentally different regarding
market participation, price setting mechanisms and regulation, effects may vary.
3.4 Results on transaction prices
Table 3 contains the results for the regressions of all trades (OTC and exchange). Column
1 of the table shows that there is, indeed, an immediate price impact stemming from the
trade's volume: Selling prices tend to be lower, the higher the volume a bank attempts
to trade. This suggests a lack of market liquidity in bond markets. More importantly,
prices also appear to be lower when the banking sector as a whole records a high volume
of net sales to outside investors. In the regressions in column 2, we allow for different
price impacts in different subperiods. The results show that the effect of aggregate net
sales is driven by the post-Lehman period, whereas net purchase volumes are not related
to prices in the other periods. Hence, although the volume regressions did not find any
evidence of fire sale behavior, there seems to have been tight market liquidity in the post-
Lehman period, reflected in strong reactions by prices to trading volumes. This result
is plausible since market conditions can be expected to be worst immediately after the
Lehman collapse as there was only a small number of traders willing to provide market
liquidity at that time.
Finally, in column 3, we explore how the price impact differs between eligible and
ineligible assets. To that aim, we use the time-varying variable eligiblej,t
, which equals
one whenever an individual asset is eligible, and interact it with the net purchasing volume
to outside investors. The coefficient of the interaction term is negative and significant.
Adding the coefficients on net buy and net buy ˇ eligible shows that the price impact for
eligible assets is close to zero in the pre-Lehman period. So, for this period, we find a
price impact only for ineligible assets, indicating that outside investors were willing to
buy eligible assets without a discount. This is plausible given that eligible assets are
often government bonds, which are generally seen as the most liquid bonds. Moreover,
banks are not forced to sell such assets into a falling market. Instead of selling such
assets, they could be used as collateral in central bank transactions, which would help

avoid negative price effects while also providing liquidity. In the period surrounding the
collapse of Lehman Brothers, the overall effect is also significant for eligible assets, but
the overall effect is more muted than for ineligible assets.
Table 4 shows separate regressions for OTC trades and trades at exchanges. Columns 1
to 3 show that the results for OTC trades are very similar to the previous ones. Most im-
portantly, the coefficient of log(net buyj,t
) is positive and highly significant, which is again
largely driven by the post-Lehman period and is stronger for ineligible assets. However,
there is also a significant effect for the extended basket period in columns 2 and 3. This
could stem from upward price pressure due to the high volume of purchases of extended
basket assets by banks in this period. In columns 4 to 6, we see the same regressions as
in columns 1 to 3 for exchange trades only. Interestingly, we do not find any significant
positive correlation of selling activity with prices. The coefficient of the net trade vol-
ume is even significantly negative in the post-Lehman period, which indicates that banks
acted as market liquidity providers on exchanges following the Lehman collapse. It is
possible that they were buying assets which had previously diminished in value, inducing
a negative correlation between trade volume and prices. The results suggest that mar-
17
ket liquidity for banks mainly deteriorated in OTC markets, especially after the Lehman
collapse, and mostly for ineligible assets. In the meantime, banks were market liquidity
providers on exchange markets after the Lehman event and made use of favorable trading
opportunities by buying securities at comparatively low prices.

4 Empirical Analysis ­ Heterogeneity across Bank
Groups
So far, we have studied the aggregate balances of the German banking system to see how,
in the aggregate, German banks reacted to the Lehman crisis and the monetary policy
responses that followed. However, this approach does not take into account the potential
heterogeneity within the German banking sector. For example, it could be the case that
banks facing a liquidity shortfall after Lehman's demise had to engage in a fire sale to
generate liquidity while banks with ample liquidity purchased these assets, rendering the
aggregate effect zero. The same could be true for banks with high or low regulatory
capital ratios: While some might want to sell assets with a comparatively high regulatory
risk weight to relax the regulatory capital constraint, banks with more regulatory capital
18
might have had more risk-bearing capacities and purchased the assets that the stressed
banks sold.
In order to capture such effects, we divide the banks into groups according to their
liquidity buffers and regulatory capital ratios, and study the evolution of asset holdings
for the respective groups. More specifically, we use bank balance sheets as at the end of
June 2008, before our investigation period began, in order to avoid endogeneity problems.
As before, we start by analyzing trading volumes before considering the effects on prices.
4.1 Empirical specification for trading volumes
Equation (2) looks at the German banking system's trading balance with respect to the
rest of the world, and thus the extent to which the German banking system as a whole
provided or absorbed market liquidity. However, as we argued above, the events are likely
to have a stronger impact on banks with fewer liquid assets and weaker capital positions.
In addition, it may be the case that, for example, banks with a higher level of liquidity
provide liquidity to less liquid banks, which would not be reflected in the aggregate, as
the sales and purchases offset each other.17 Consequently, important differences in the
reactions of specific bank groups may be missed by Equation (2). Therefore, in line with
the important differences between banks cited above, we compare bank groups based on
two balance sheet characteristics, which are computed using the Deutsche Bundesbank's
Monthly Balance Sheet Statistics. First, we use the ratio of liquid assets to short-term
liabilities, which indicates a bank's liquidity position, given the liabilities it has to repay
in the weeks ahead. If the ratio is above one, a bank has enough liquidity to repay short-
term debt and is thus relatively independent of the money market. A ratio below one
indicates that a bank either has to rely on the money market to roll over maturing debt
or take on new debt to repay maturing contracts. If a bank is unable to do so, it has to
sell off illiquid assets to service its obligations, which can potentially result in a fire sale.
In other words, the ratio is an indicator of the resilience of a bank to a stressed money
market and unfavorable refinancing conditions.
Furthermore, we use a measure regarding the capital position of a bank, namely the
ratio of tier-1 capital to risk weighted assets, which measures regulatory capital adequacy.
The lower the capital ratio, the worse the capital position of a bank. Consequently, these
banks are more vulnerable to price shocks as falling prices might translate into lower
valuations of assets on the balance sheet and may further reduce a bank's capital. Banks
closer to the minimum regulatory capital ratio should then be more eager to sell assets. To
build up regulatory capital, banks ought to sell assets with a higher risk weight. In order
to obtain a clean measure of a bank's position that is not distorted by the events studied
here, we use the balance sheets as at 30 June 2008. To facilitate interpretation, we split
the banks at the median of each ratio to form two bank groups for each characteristic.
The banks with less liquid assets or a lower capital ratio should have been hit harder
by the Lehman default and should be the ones benefitting more from the unconventional
monetary policy measures.
Against this backdrop, the regressions that take bank heterogeneity into account look
17Given that weighting was carried out based on an individual bank's total assets, the numbers might
not add up to zero if the selling banks and the purchasing banks differ in size. Using unweighted holdings
yields similar results, compare Figures A1 and A2 in the appendix.

We interact the events with a dummy variable indicating riskier banks in terms of their
liquidity or capital to check whether we can detect fire sales for certain bank groups. Here,
risk groupi
stands for the dummies that indicate the riskier banks according to one of
the two characteristics. With respect to liquid assets to short-term liabilities, the dummy
variable equals one for the banks with a liquid assets to short-term liabilities ratio below
the median; for the tier-1 capital ratio it equals one for the banks with a tier-1 capital
ratio below the median.
4.2 Results on trading volumes
We start by looking at banks with different levels of liquidity relative to their short-term
obligations as at the onset of the Lehman crisis. We split banks at the median of the
distribution of liquid assets to short-term liabilities at the end of June 2008. Banks above
the median have more liquid assets compared with their possible short-term payment
obligations; we therefore name them "liquid banks." By extension, banks below the
median are the "less liquid banks." Results for the liquidity groups can be seen in Figure 3
and Table 5. In the upper left-hand graph of Figure 3 we see the holdings of narrow
basket assets of the two bank groups. As illustrated, both groups started to invest more
in narrow basket assets after the default of Lehman Brothers, with the increase being a
great deal more pronounced for the less liquid banks (denoted by the red graph). A general
trend towards assets eligible to obtain central bank liquidity could be observed, although
this demand was more strongly driven by less liquid banks. This seems reasonable as
banks with less liquidity should increase their holdings of assets giving access to central
bank liquidity, especially when (unsecured) interbank funding becomes scarce. Again, the
graphical results can be confirmed by the regression analysis in Table 5. We see that both
bank groups, and less liquid banks in particular, shift into narrow basket assets after the
Lehman collapse (column 1).
When looking at the results for extended basket assets in the upper right-hand graph
of Figure 3, it is evident that we can attribute the sales of assets found in the aggregate to
the less liquid banks, which suggests that those banks tried to dispose of assets that could
not be used to generate central bank liquidity. However, the difference is not statistically
significant (see column 2 of Table 5). Both types of banks shift into extended basket assets
after the collateral extension, but the effect is much stronger for liquid banks, which is
reflected in a highly significant, negative and large coefficient of the respective interaction
term. This could be explained by the fact that extended basket assets provide lower
liquidity services than narrow basket assets due to their higher haircut, while yielding a
higher return at the same time. Since haircuts are less of a concern for liquid banks, it
seems plausible that banks with a stronger liquidity buffer were more prone to move into
newly eligible and more profitable assets.
The lower left-hand graph shows the results for never eligible bonds. It becomes ap-

Figure 3 divides banks in two groups according to the median of their liquid assets to short-term liabilities
as at June 2008. The graphs show for both groups the net (purchases ­ sales) euro trading volume of the
group's banks, weighted by each bank's total assets as at June 2008, cumulated over days and averaged
per day within each group, for all assets grouped by their ECB eligibility. For further information refer

parent here that less liquid banks did not want to hold ineligible assets once full allotment
had been introduced. At this point, they rapidly disposed of these bonds, while liquid
banks gradually moved into never eligible bonds. These results are also reflected in the
highly significant and negative coefficients of the interactions terms for the full-allotment
and extended-basket periods (see column 3 of Table 5). Yet even this sharp decrease in the
net purchasing volume can hardly be described as fire sales because the same bank group
was shifting into other assets at the same time. Hence, not even at the disaggregated
level is there any evidence of fire sales.
Another interesting observation concerns the never eligible stocks in the lower right-
hand panel. As was shown in Section 3, banks turned into net buyers of stocks and
derivatives after the Lehman incident, which remained the case after the introduction of
policy measures. Here we see that the liquid banks in particular changed their behavior
after the demise of Lehman, shifting towards higher holdings of never eligible stocks. This
development is reflected in significantly positive and large coefficients for liquid banks in
the regressions for the post-Lehman and full-allotment periods, whereas the effect for less

liquid banks (being the sum of the base effect and the coefficient of the interaction term)
is close to zero (column 4 of Table 5). Since the increase started directly after the Lehman
event, it seems unlikely that banks were unconditionally seeking exposure to never eligible
assets. The more plausible reason is that this increase is attributable to a higher supply
of these assets, which was taken up by the banks with the highest liquidity.
Next, we study the effects of different levels of bank capital, measured in terms of the
regulatory tier-1 capital ratio (see Table 6 and Figure 4). In general, highly capitalized
banks behave similarly to the aggregate: We observe a flight to liquidity, especially to
narrow basket assets, and a shift towards stocks. By contrast, less capitalized banks shift
less into narrow basket assets and more into riskier extended basket assets. This could
be indicative of risk-shifting or "search for yield" behavior as extended basket assets are
riskier on balance but also offer a higher coupon. This, too, is consistent with Acharya
and Steffen (2015), who show that poorly capitalized banks exhibited a higher exposure to
high-yield peripheral country bonds. Lastly, we see that less capitalized banks move out
of never eligible stocks, whereas better capitalized banks record high net purchases. This
suggests that banks with a higher risk-bearing capacity bought these assets in response to
an increased supply, partly due to less capitalized banks, which disposed of these assets
as they had become too risky or too capital-intensive.
Again, the regression results are consistent with the graphical analysis (Table 6).
Both types of banks shift into narrow basket assets, the effect being much stronger for
well-capitalized banks. Both bank groups also shift into extended basket assets after the

For well-capitalized banks, we observed high net purchases of never eligible stocks, while
less capitalized banks shift away from those assets.
4.3 Empirical specification for transaction prices
In this final section, we again consider the effect of banks' trading behavior on transaction
prices. We are particularly interested in testing whether the aggregate results on prices
from the previous section are, indeed, driven by constrained banks having to accept less
favorable prices. Previous research on fire sales has focused on distressed entities and has
found that the selling prices of distressed firms are lower and their price impact larger
than for firms that are in good condition (Pulvino (1998), Coval and Stafford (2007), Ellul
et al. (2011), Chu (2016)). Consequently, we would expect that the price impact of trades
by liquidity- or capital-constrained banks is higher than that of other banks. To study
this, we calculate the net purchasing volume per asset of constrained banks only and use

4.4 Results on transaction prices
Column 1 of Table 7 shows the regression where we split the price impact between the
four subperiods and distinguish between banks that are constrained and those that are
not constrained in terms of their liquidity. While there is still a significant price impact of
trading by all banks, the net trading volume of liquidity-constrained banks has a signif-
icant additional impact on selling prices in the post-Lehman period. This indicates that
liquidity-constrained banks were, indeed, forced to accept lower prices. As we showed in
Section 4, liquidity-constrained banks continued to act as net buyers of eligible assets; this
development is therefore probably attributable to sales of ineligible assets. In column 2,
we see that the price impact of constrained banks for ineligible assets is, in fact, higher
although the difference is not significant here. Results are similar for capital-constrained
banks (see columns 3 and 4).
We now distinguish again between OTC and exchange transactions. The results can be
seen in Table A1 for liquidity-constrained banks and in Table A2 for capital-constrained

bank (see the appendix for these tables). For OTC transactions, the results for liquidity-
constrained banks mirror the previous results (see columns 1 and 2 of Table A1). In
addition, the interaction with the eligibility status becomes significant in these regressions.
By contrast, columns 3 and 4 show no significant additional impact of the trading of
liquidity-constrained banks for exchange transactions, except for the marginally significant
coefficient for the full allotment period. So while there is clear evidence that the sales
carried out by liquidity-constrained banks in OTC markets contributed to OTC price
declines, this does not seem to have been the case for trading prices on exchanges.
In Table A2 we see the results for capital-constrained banks. The results for OTC
markets are now even stronger than in the regressions considering liquidity-constrained
banks. There is a significant relation between the selling volume of capital-constrained
banks and selling prices, especially in the post-Lehman period. And again, when we look
at the results for exchange trades, there is no such relation, which suggests that only OTC
markets were vulnerable to distressed selling by constrained banks.
Summing up, we see that banks' selling prices depend on the amount of sales to outside
investors, with selling prices being lower if the selling volume is higher. This relationship
became more pronounced after the Lehman collapse and applied to liquidity- or capital-
constrained banks, in particular. However, these relationships hold only for OTC markets,
while banks' trading volume has no impact on prices in the context of exchange markets,
suggesting that OTC markets are particularly vulnerable to adverse market conditions
and to selling pressure from constrained banks.
5 Conclusion
Using a detailed, trade-level dataset on the trading behavior of German banks around
the time of the Lehman collapse, we have shown that this disrupting event did not result
in widespread fire sales in the German banking sector, either in the aggregate or within
certain bank groups. Instead, we observe a general flight to liquidity as all bank groups
shift into the most liquid asset class, i. e., narrow basket assets, which can easily be
transformed into liquidity at the central bank. Moreover, trading behavior was influenced
strongly by unconventional monetary policy measures. In particular, the introduction
of the extended basket led to a shift towards newly eligible assets. Hence, the observed
trades seem to have occurred largely as a result of portfolio rebalancing in response to
monetary policy measures rather than distress. Transactions prices show some evidence
of tight market liquidity after the Lehman collapse. However, price pressures subsided
once full allotment was introduced. Overall, German banks acted both as market liquidity
providers and central bank liquidity seekers during the 2008 crisis.
Distinguishing between different bank groups we find that illiquid banks invested in
narrow basket assets and sold ineligible bonds at the same time, presumably to improve
their liquidity position. In contrast, liquid banks invested in extended basket assets and
stocks, which may have been driven by profitability considerations. Interestingly, liquid
banks appear to have played an important role in absorbing the increased supply of
never eligible stocks, which may have helped to stabilize prices. Finally, we find that less
capitalized banks invest more heavily in riskier bonds, which could be an indication of
risk-shifting or search for yield. The observed price effects of trading after the Lehman
26
collapse were driven mostly by banks constrained by their liquidity or capital and by trades
in the OTC market, which appears to be most vulnerable to adverse market conditions.
The deep concern about fire sale externalities could not be confirmed for the German
banking sector during this particular period. The absence of broad-based fire sales in our
sample does not imply that fire sales did not take place in other financial markets, by
non-banks or with assets not captured by our dataset. However, given the scope of our
dataset it is unlikely that such fire sales strongly affected the German financial system.
There is, however, some evidence of tight market liquidity in the post-Lehman period,
which was mitigated by the European Central Bank's unconventional monetary policy.
This suggests that these policy measures contributed to stabilizing the financial system
after the Lehman collapse.

Never eligible stocks quantities
Figure A1 shows the net (purchases ­ sales) trading volume (using only euro quantities without prices) of
all 120 banks, weighted by each bank's total assets as at June 2008, averaged per day and cumulated over
days, for all assets grouped by their ECB eligibility. Increases reflect an expansion in asset holdings while
decreases represent net sales. Note that the series for never eligible stocks differs from the price-weighted
series in Figure 2 as it only adds up the number of assets involved in each trade while prices are very
heterogeneous. For further information refer to Figure 2. Sources: Microdatabase Securities Holdings
Statistics, 1 July 2008 - 30 November 2008, own calculations, ECB, Deutsche Bundesbank.
