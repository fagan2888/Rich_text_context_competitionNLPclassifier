Self-Perceived Mate Value, Facial
Attractiveness, and Mate Preferences:
Do Desirable Men Want It All?
Steven Arnocky1
Abstract
Ten years ago, Buss and Shackelford demonstrated that high mate value (i.e., physically attractive) women held more discerning
mate preferences relative to lower mate value women. Since then, researchers have begun to consider the equally important role
of men's sexual selectivity in human mate choice. Yet, little research has focused on whether high mate value men are similarly
choosy in their mate preferences. In a sample of 139 undergraduate men, relationships between self-perceived mate value as well
as female-rated facial attractiveness were examined in relation to men's expressed mate preferences. Results showed that self-
perceived mate value was unrelated to men's facial attractiveness as rated by women. Men who believed they were of high mate
value were more likely than lower mate value men to prefer to marry at a younger age; to have a spouse who was younger than
them; and to have a partner who was sociable, ambitious, high in social status, with good financial prospects, a desire for children,
health, good looks, and mutual attraction. Objective male facial attractiveness was generally unrelated to heightened mate
preferences, with the exception of heightened preference for similar religious background and good physical health. Findings
suggest that men who perceive themselves as high in overall mate value are selective in their mate choice in a manner similar to
high mate value women.

Humans have been shown to alter their mating strategies and
tactics according to a host of contextual factors (e.g., Arnocky,
Ribout, Mirza, & Knack, 2014; Arnocky, Woodruff, &
Schmitt, 2016). Individuals' mate value, or the extent to which
they exhibit the qualities desired in a mate by the opposite sex,
may be one such factor relevant to individuals' mating deci-
sions. Indeed, some researchers have argued that psychological
mechanisms, such as the tendency to make social comparisons
(i.e., to compare oneself to [often same sex] others on impor-
tant characteristics) and self-esteem (ostensibly a gauge of
where one stands on important mate value characteristics;
Brase & Guy, 2004), may have been selected for in part
because they allow for the assessment of one's own relative
mate value. In turn, one's relative mate value would then guide
the use of specific mating strategies or tactics in a variety of
ways. For example, women who perceive themselves to be of
lower mate value (e.g., less physically attractive) relative to
intrasexual rivals have been found to hold more positive
attitudes toward enhancing their own physical appearance,
even if it entails health risk (Arnocky, Perilloux, Cloud, Bird,
& Thomas, 2016; Hill & Durante, 2011), to exhibit more
romantic jealousy, and to engage in more aggression toward
both other women and romantic partners (Arnocky, Sunderani,
Miller, & Vaillancourt, 2012).
Buss and Shackelford (2008) suggested that mate value is
one important individual difference factor that should also
guide women's mate preferences. Because few men exhibit all
of the qualities that would be optimally desired in a mate, there
must exist a fundamental trade-off in which of these qualities

we prioritize in a partner (Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, & Simp-
son, 2007; Gangestad & Simpson, 2000). In long-term mating,
women prefer indices of investment and parenting proclivities,
whereas short-term mating typically entails greater prioritiza-
tion of good-gene indicators, such as physical attractiveness
and masculinity. However, Buss and Shackelford (2008) rea-
soned that due to assortative mating (10's tendency to mate
with 10's and 5's tendency to mate with 5's), some particularly
high mate value women ought to be able to attract men who
exhibit both good-gene and good investment/parenting charac-
teristics. Women's physical attractiveness, derived from face
and body ratings made by interviewers, is an important com-
ponent of female mate value (Li, Kenrick, Bailey, & Linsen-
meier, 2002). In the Buss and Shackelford study, attractiveness
was positively correlated with heightened mate preferences
across multiple domains, including good-gene indicators such
as preferring a more masculinized, sexy, and physically fit
man; investment ability indicators including having good earn-
ing potential, having a college education, and being older; and
good parenting indicators such as desire for home and children,
fondness for children, and emotional stability. Attractiveness
was also related to the good partner indicator of being loving.
Similarly, Wincenciak and colleagues (2015) showed that
women with healthier looking faces showed stronger concor-
dance between their preference for men's healthy-looking
faces and their actual romantic partner's rated facial health; a
pattern that was not observed among men. This finding sug-
gests that high mate value women (but perhaps not men) might
not only hold more discerning mate preferences (i.e., such as
for healthy male faces) but might also be better able to express
those mate preferences in their actual mating relations (i.e.,
actually having a mate with a healthier looking face) relative
to lower mate value women.
Importantly, the role of one's own mate value in guiding
mating-relevant behavior is not limited to women. Bird, Carr´
e,
Knack, and Arnocky (2016) primed men with either low or high
self-perceived mate value using a bogus online-dating task that
purported to analyze facial attractiveness in conjunction with
self-reported mate value traits (e.g., income, education, person-
ality, and social status). In two studies, men primed with low
mate value were subsequently more willing to aggressively
guard their partner from an attractive mate poacher (Study 1)
and to engage in more in vivo aggression against a same-sex
rival (Study 2). In another priming study, Yong and Li (2012)
exposed males and females to either large quantities of either
money or paper, and subsequently examined their mate prefer-
ences. Results showed that men, but not women, exhibited more
discerning preferences for a date when handling a large sum of
money. To the extent that monetary resource availability may
serve as one index of a male's mate value, it is hypothesized that
men's mate value should also influence their mate preferences.
Should We Expect Men to Be Choosy?
Mammalian mate choice is widely considered to revolve
around female selectivity coupled with male competition for
those choosy females. However, recent theoretical reformula-
tions have highlighted the important roles of both male selec-
tivity and of female intrasexual competition for mates. This is
particularly relevant to human mate choice, which is somewhat
unique among sexually reproducing species in that humans
normally mate with some degree of monogamy and males often
provide substantial parental investment of resources and care
toward offspring at a cost of total reproductive effort directed
toward accessing additional mates. Such "long-term" mating
strategies compel males to be more selective in their mate
choice and females to compete intrasexually for access to the
most desirable males (see Arnocky & Vaillancourt, 2017, for
review). Unsurprisingly then, research has demonstrated that
men's mate preferences differ when considering a long-term
versus short-term partner. For example, Regan, Levin, Spre-
cher, Christopher, and Gate (2000) found that whereas both
men and women focused on sexual desirability (e.g., attractive-
ness, health, sex drive, and athleticism) when evaluating a
short-term sexual partner (see also Confer, Perilloux, & Buss,
2010), both sexes were more likely to emphasize characteris-
tics such as similarity and socially appealing personality when
considering long-term mate preferences. Nevertheless, to date,
little research has examined whether men's own mate value
might correlate positively with their long-term mate prefer-
ences in a manner similar to what has been observed in women.
Are High Mate Value Men Choosy?
There is some evidence that men who perceive themselves to
be high in mate value (or traits associated with mate value) are
more selective with respect to desired traits in their long-term
partners relative to men who view themselves as lower in mate
value. Buston and Emlen (2003) had 978 heterosexual partici-
pants rate the importance of 10 attributes (across the categories
of wealth and status, family commitment, physical appearance,
and sexual fidelity) in a long-term partner. The participants also
rated themselves on those same attributes. The authors found
evidence of homophily between self-ratings and partner pre-
ferences across the categories, such that both women and men
who rated themselves higher across these traits were more
likely to prefer a partner who was also high on those same
traits.
Similarly, Edlund and Sagarin (2010) found that in an
unbudgeted mate-preference task, high self-perceived mate
value corresponded with more discriminating mate preferences
in a sample of men and women. However, this effect was
observed only when using a single-item measure of mate value.
Using a more comprehensive measure (a five-factor mate value
inventory tapping various dimensions of mate value) revealed
that only one of the five factors (status) related meaningfully to
holding more discerning mate preferences averaged across 13
traits such as creativity, kindness, intelligence, physical attrac-
tiveness, humor, and income. Moreover, imposition of a mating
"budget" largely eliminated these links. However, the rele-
vance of such an artificial budget in and of itself appears con-
tradictory to the hypothesis being tested, given that (1) in real-
2 Evolutionary Psychology
world mating scenarios not everyone is subject to the same
mating "budget," in that (2) one's own mate value would pre-
sumably affect the type of mate one can "afford," such that high
mate value individuals can likely obtain a mate with more
overall desirable characteristics. More importantly, the Edlund
and Sagarin (2010) study also involved a relatively small sam-
ple of 59 men, with another 20 participants being dropped from
the analyses for various reasons (the number of those who were
men was not reported). Whereas Buss and Shackelford (2008)
examined a potentially more objective (other-rated) index of
mate value, both the Buston and Emlin (2003) and Edlund and
Sagarin (2010) studies relied solely on self-perceived own mate
value.
The Present Study
The goal of the present study was to build upon these earlier
findings by examining whether men's objective (other-rated)
facial attractiveness (following Buss & Shackelford, 2008, and
Wincenciak et al., 2015) or their self-perceived total mate value
(following Edlund & Sagarin, 2010) correspond with heigh-
tened unbudgeted mate preferences in a sample of young men.
Facial attractiveness ratings were used as an index of men's
physical attractiveness because this variable (along with body
and total attractiveness ratings) reliably predicted women's
mate preferences in the Buss and Shackelford (2008) study.
Although research has shown that women are willing to
trade-off men's attractiveness for resources in the context of
long-term mating, women are not averse to forming long-term
relationships with attractive men (Waynforth, 2000) and will
prefer to mate with attractive men if they are themselves of
high mate value (Buss & Shackelford, 2008).
Previous work has shown concordance between men's facial
attractiveness and other physical markers of mate value, such
as vocal attractiveness as judged by female adults and adoles-
cents, but not by female children (Saxton, Carlyle, & Roberts,
2006), as well as semen quality (Soler et al., 2003). These
results suggest that men's facial attractiveness is a mate value
trait detectable by, and particularly relevant to, reproductive-
aged women. Moreover, Jokela (2009) has demonstrated that
men's facial attractiveness (from yearbook photos) related to
reproductive success such that men with low facial attractive-
ness were less likely to be married and had fewer children than
more attractive men. Similarly, Prokop and Fedor (2011) found
that in a sample of Slovakian men, facial attractiveness pre-
dicted likelihood of being married (i.e., being selected for long-
term mating) and in turn, married men had higher reproductive
success. Even when controlling for marriage status, facially
attractive men had higher reproductive success. Rhodes, Sim-
mons, and Peters (2005) found that men's facial attractiveness
also predicted having more short-term sex partners than men
with less attractive faces, suggesting that men's facial attrac-
tiveness may be one important biological indicator of men's
mate value that impacts female mate choice. Following Buston
and Emlen (2003) and Edlund and Sagarin (2010), we also
assessed self-perceived mate value across multiple dimensions
to address the possibility that self-perceived mate value may be
more important than one singular physical indicator of actual
mate value in driving our mate preferences. Both female-rated
facial attractiveness and self-perceived mate value were exam-
ined in relation to 21 mate preferences derived from Buss
(1989) which have been shown cross-culturally to serve as
universal dimensions of long-term mate preference across cate-
gories of love versus status/resources, dependable/stable versus
good looks/health, education/intelligence versus desire for
home/children, and sociability versus similar religion (Shack-
elford, Schmitt, & Buss, 2005). It was hypothesized that both
self-perceived mate value (Hypothesis 1) and female-rated
facial attractiveness (Hypothesis 2) would each correlate posi-
tively with increased mate preferences across desirable partner
characteristics, examined both individually and as an average
mate-preference score. The potential influence of current rela-
tionship status upon these relationships was also examined.
Method
Participants
As part of a larger study on male and female mating psychol-
ogy (see Davis, Dufort, Desrochers, Vaillancourt, & Arnocky,
2017), 139 undergraduate men aged 17­29 years (M ¼ 20.75,
SD ¼ 2.37) were recruited from a university and college in
Northern Ontario using the campus online research participa-
tion system and recruitment stations in common areas. Partici-
pants were primarily Caucasian (93.5%), followed by Black
(2%), Asian (1.5%), Arab, South Asian, Native/Aboriginal, and
Latin American (<1% each). Men currently in romantic rela-
tionships constituted 49% of the sample.
Materials and Procedure
Participants were led to a private and quiet testing room where
they completed a counterbalanced survey package (paper and
pencil) as part of a larger study on mating behavior. Following
completion of the study, participants were debriefed and were
remunerated with partial course credit or CAN$5.
Self-perceived mate value. Self-perceived mate value was
assessed using the Components of Mate Value Survey (CMVS;
Fisher, Cox, Bennett, & Gavric, 2008). The measure consists of
22 items with response options ranging along a 7-point Likert-
type scale. The CMVS incorporates items from a diverse set of
mate value dimensions including sociality (e.g., "I run into
friends wherever I go"), how the respondent is viewed by
members of the opposite sex (e.g., "Members of the opposite
sex are attracted to me"), parenting (e.g., "I would make a good
parent"), wealth (e.g., "I want people to think that I am
wealthy"), physical attractiveness (e.g., "I would like members
of the opposite sex to consider me sexy"), relationship history
(e.g., "After I date someone they often want to date me again"),
and fear of romantic failure ("I often worry about not having a
date"). In the present study, the measure showed good internal
consistency (a ¼ .85).

Facial attractiveness. Facial photographs were taken using a 16
megapixel Nikon Cool Pix L830 digital camera using standar-
dized distance and lighting and against a neutral backdrop. The
photos were then rated on physical attractiveness using a 10-
point Likert-type scale (1 ¼ very unattractive, 10 ¼ very
attractive) by five undergraduate women who were naive to
the goal of the study. The five raters demonstrated acceptable
agreement in their ratings (a ¼ .73).
Mate preferences. Participants completed the measure of factors
involved in choosing a mate (Buss, 1989). Specifically, parti-
cipants completed 3 items in which they indicated "At what age
would you prefer to marry?" "What age difference would you
prefer between you and your spouse?" and "Whom would you
prefer to be older (self or spouse)." For the first 2 items, the age
response was treated as a continuous variable, and the age
preference item (self or spouse) was coded as follows: 1 ¼
preferring self to be older than spouse and 2 ¼ preferring
spouse to be older than self. Participants then rated 18 partner
traits on a 4-point Likert-type scale coded as follows: 0 ¼
irrelevant or unimportant; 1 ¼ desirable, but not very impor-
tant; 2 ¼ important, but not indispensable; and 3 ¼ indispen-
sable, give it. Each item was treated and examined
independently as a unique trait or characteristic found in a
mate. The 18 mate-preference traits were also averaged to cre-
ate a total mate-preference score which demonstrated accepta-
ble reliability in their ratings (a ¼ .68).
Results
First, the potential influence of relationship status upon study
variables was examined using a series of independent-samples t
tests. Results showed that men currently in relationships pre-
ferred to marry approximately 2 years younger (M ¼ 27.7,
SD ¼ 7.19) than men who were not in relationships (M ¼
29.7, SD ¼ 2.61), t(126) ¼ 2.10, p ¼ .038, d ¼ .37, and pre-
ferred less of an age difference between them and their partner
(M ¼ 1.95, SD ¼ 1.40) compared to men who were not in
relationships (M ¼ 2.57, SD ¼ 1.65), t(123) ¼ 2.24, p ¼
.027, d ¼ .40. Men in relationships also preferred partners with
higher desire for home and children (M ¼ 2.12, SD ¼ 0.96)
relative to men who were not in relationships (M ¼ 1.77, SD ¼
1.10), t(134) ¼ À1.98, p ¼ .050, d ¼ .34. Men in relationships
desired chastity in a partner (M ¼ 0.64, SD ¼ 0.84) relative to
men who were not in relationships (M ¼ 0.32, SD ¼ 0.61),
t(123) ¼ À2.34, p ¼ .012, d ¼ .44. Finally, men in relationships
had less desire for a partner high in social status (M ¼ 1.06,
SD ¼ 0.87) relative to men not in relationships (M ¼ 1.45,
SD ¼ 0.81), t(134) ¼ 2.64, p ¼ .008, d ¼ .46.
Given that current relationship status related to some of the
mate preferences described above, the relationship between
mate value indices (self-report and rated facial attractiveness)
were examined both with and without controlling for relation-
ship status. Controlling for relationship status did not yield any
meaningful differences in the findings; therefore, following
Buss and Shackelford (2008), only the bivariate relationships
are presented. This yielded a comparison of 21 mate prefer-
ences in relation to two indices of men's mate value (i.e., 42
planned comparisons). Accordingly, multiple comparisons
were corrected for using the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995)
procedure with the critical value for a false discovery rate set at
0.15. This procedure did not alter the interpretation of conven-
tional p values of less than .05 being interpreted as statistically
significant. Thus, for ease of interpretation the uncorrected p
values are reported herein.
Results showed that objective (female-rated) facial attrac-
tiveness was unrelated to men's overall perception of their total
self-perceived mate value, r ¼ À.03, p ¼ .76, nor did it relate to
CMVS subscales of men's own ratings of how good-looking
they were, r ¼ .04, p ¼ .63, or how attractive they were to the
opposite sex, r ¼ À.05, p ¼ .57, suggesting that the female
facial ratings provided unique information about the partici-
pants' attractiveness that was potentially distinct from men's
own self-perceptions. Table 1 provides bivariate correlations
between the measures of mate value and men's mate
preferences.
Female-rated facial attractiveness was largely unrelated to
mate preferences, with the exception of similar religious back-
ground and good health--both of which were preferred more
strongly by men with attractive versus less attractive faces.
Facial attractiveness also correlated modestly (p < .10) with
preferring a more ambitious and industrious partner. Men with
high facial attractiveness also exhibited a modestly greater
preference for partners who are high in ambition and indus-
triousness. However, men with higher overall self-perceived
mate value held stronger preferences for marrying younger,
preferred a younger partner, as well as sociable partners with
good financial prospects, desire for home and children, social
status, good looks, ambition, and mutual attraction and love
relative to men with lower self-perceived mate value. High
self-perceived mate value among men also correlated modestly
with an overall larger age difference between partners and with
a preference for having a partner in good health. Both facial
attractiveness and self-perceived mate value were then entered
into a regression equation with total mate-preference score
entered as the dependent variable. Results showed that self-
perceived mate value (b ¼ .37, p ¼ .001) but not facial attrac-
tiveness (b ¼ .11, p ¼ .20) predicted higher overall mate-
preference score, R2
adj
¼ .12 (Figure 1).
Discussion
The present study built upon established links between
women's mate value and heightened mate preferences across
broad dimensions (Buss & Shackelford, 2008) by extending
preliminary findings linking men's mate value to their mate
preferences (Buston & Emlin, 2003; Edlund & Sagarin,
2010). Specifically, both other-rated facial attractiveness (Buss
& Shackelford, 2008) and self-reported mate value (Fisher
et al., 2008) were examined in relation to 21 mate preferences
(Buss, 1989).
4 Evolutionary Psychology
Results showed a clear pattern of relations between self-
perceived mate value and expressed mate preferences. First,
men who believed themselves as higher in mate value reported
stronger preferences for a partner who desired home and chil-
dren and for marrying at an earlier age. Buss and Shackelford
(2008) suggested that men who married younger would have
historically been among the most reproductively successful
(Symons, 1979). Following this logic, high mate value men
would be most able to express this preference. To the author's
knowledge, this is the first study to link perceived mate value to
a desire to marry at a younger age, and thus this potentially
important finding bears replication attempt in future research.
It is also unsurprising that perceivably high mate value men
also desired a larger age difference between them and their
partner, and more specifically to marry a partner younger than
them, given that youth is a marker of fertility in women. Pre-
vious research on the Hadza (Tanzanian hunter­gatherers) has
shown that men who prefer youth in a partner also prefer good
looks in a partner (Marlowe, 2004). In this study, high mate
value men also preferred both mutual attraction/love and a
partner who was good-looking, given that physical appearance
can also serve as a marker of health and/or fertility (see
Arnocky et al., 2014, for review). Mutual attraction/love may
also serve to indicate likelihood or propensity of sexual access,
positive treatment within the relationship, or perhaps likelihood
of partner infidelity or defection.
High mate value men also desired a partner who was more
sociable and had good social status. Some recent research on
the Agta and the BaYaka demonstrated that women's indirect
social centrality (i.e., second- and third-degree ties) correlated
with them producing significantly more living offspring (Page
et al., 2017). High mate value men were also more likely to
prefer partners who were ambitious with good financial pros-
pects relative to lower mate value men. Although past research
has demonstrated that women on the whole prefer these traits in
men, it may not be surprising that men who can afford to also
express preference for these traits would do so, especially in
contemporary Western society. In Canada, the number of dual-
income families with children has doubled since 1976 (Statis-
tics Canada, 2016). This trend was reported to be due in part by
changes in cultural attitudes coupled with growth in women's
attained education, but also necessitated by general labor mar-
ket conditions (Statistics Canada, 2016). Other research on
rural Caribbean villagers has shown that individuals with more
resources (i.e., land) generally had better reproductive success
(Flinn, 1986), and some past research has linked wealth to
reproductive success (Essock-Vitale, 1984; Hopcroft, 2006),
whereas other studies have not (Kanazawa, 2003). Neverthe-
less, it is unclear to what extent family (as opposed to individ-
ual) income might factor in to contemporary indices of
reproductive success. Some quasi-experimental research has
shown that increases in total household income can lead to
ostensible indices of offspring quality, such as higher levels
of education and lower criminality (Akee, Copeland, Keeler,
Angold, & Costello, 2010). Future researchers may thus seek to
identify the factors or motivations underlying men's prefer-
ences for a partner with good earning capacity.

Finally, self-perceived mate value showed a modest correla-
tion with preference for a healthy mate. Given the importance
of partner's (and particularly female) health in pathogen avoid-
ance, providing disease resistance to offspring, and in the
capacity to survive in order to rear offspring to reproductive
age (see Arnocky, Pearson, & Vaillancourt, 2015; Tybur &
Gangestad, 2011 for review), it is sensible that high mate value
men would also express this preference more strongly than
lower mate value men. Together, it appears that men's per-
ceived mate value aligns with their mate preferences in a
domain-general manner.
Conversely, female-rated physical attractiveness correlated
only with preferring a similar religious background and a part-
ner in good health, and modestly with ambition. Why would
facial attractiveness, which has previously been established as
a reliable mate value characteristic in men, nevertheless be
relatively uncorrelated with men's mate preferences, especially
given previously reported links between this variable and
women's mate preferences? One possibility is that men's facial
attractiveness is a much more restricted and potentially less
important indicator of mate value relative to both women's
facial attractiveness (Buss & Shackelford, 2008) and the
diverse range of traits measured by self-report. For instance,
recent evidence has demonstrated that the relationship between
attractiveness and desirability as a mate likely relies on addi-
tional factors affecting an individual's mate value, such as
altruism and prosociality (Ehlebracht, Stavrova, Fetchenhauer,
& Farrelly, 2017). Because attractiveness, on the whole, may
be less important for men relative to women being chosen as a
mate (i.e., objective mate value; Todd, Penke, Fasolo, & Len-
ton, 2007), the fact that men's facial attractiveness related to
fewer mate-preference traits may not be surprising.
One other possibility is that men's facial attractiveness is in
and of itself a complex of diverse indicators such as facial
symmetry, averageness, masculinity, or perhaps even feminin-
ity (see Arnocky et al., 2014; Johnston, Hagel, Franklin, Fink,
& Grammer, 2001). Although attractiveness ratings were con-
sistent across raters in the present study, it is possible that
examination of the individual markers comprising male facial
attractiveness might elucidate more specific links to mate
preferences.
An additional explanation may be that individuals vary con-
siderably in their ability to accurately judge their own mate
value. For example, in a speed-dating paradigm, Back, Penke,
Schmukle, and Asendorpf (2011) asked participants to record
who they would choose as mates and who they believed would
choose them as mates. The authors found that sociosexually
unrestricted men, who require less emotional intimacy and love
prior to entering into a sexual relationship, showed greater own
mate value assessment accuracy compared to more sociosexu-
ally restricted men. Other research has also identified variabil-
ity in the ability to judge specific components of own mate
value, such as one's own physical attractiveness, and sex dif-
ferences (females may be more accurate than males; Rand &
Hall, 1983) and contextual cues (such as making social
comparisons to attractive others; Cash, Cash, & Butlers,
1983) can influence such self-assessments.
In the present study, there was no link between objective
(female-rated) facial attractiveness and either total self-
perceived mate value or self-perceived mate value subscales
relating to own attractiveness or desirability to the opposite sex.
This suggests that men's self-rated desirability may vary from
their actual desirability (at least in terms of physical attractive-
ness) to females. This is consistent with some previous research
on females which has demonstrated that self-perceptions of
attractiveness do not always align with objective and other-
perceived evaluations (e.g., Nestor, Stillman, & Frisina,
2010). Past research has shown that ratings of attractiveness
among members of the opposite sex are somewhat flexible, and
can vary according to the raters' own relationship status,
whereby single-relative to pair-bonded raters evaluate mem-
bers of the opposite sex as more attractive (Simpson, Gang-
estad, & Lerma, 1990), and whether the individual being rated
is known to the rater, whereby raters in leadership roles eval-
uate in-group subordinates as more attractive relative to other
out-group leaders (Kniffin, Wansink, Griskevicius, & Wilson,
2014). Future research might benefit from considering how
such individual differences and contextual variabilities in oth-
ers' ratings of attractiveness might influence concordance with
own ratings of attractiveness and overall mate value.
Importantly, it appears that self-perception matters more
than objective reality in terms of the mate preferences men
hold. This finding aligns with previous studies on the impor-
tance of self-perceived mate value in guiding both men's and
women's mating-relevant behavior, such as intra- and intersex-
ual aggression (Arnocky et al., 2012; Bird, Carr´
e, Knack, &
Arnocky, 2016). Women's self-rated attractiveness has also
been linked to more discerning mate preferences, such as
increased preference for masculinized male voices (Vukovic
et al., 2008). Accordingly, we would expect both objective
indices and other-perceptions of important mate value charac-
teristics to potentially exert weaker influences upon mate value
contingent psychological and behavioral processes relative to
self-perceptions of those same characteristics. Future research
examining the predictive value of self-versus other-ratings is
warranted.
One additional limitation is that the present study focused
only on self-rated mate preferences, rather than on overt mating
decisions (i.e., the levels of mate value characteristics in indi-
viduals' actual partners). It would be worthwhile to examine
whether self- versus other-rated measures of mate value corre-
spond more strongly to these actual mating outcomes surround-
ing partner quality.
Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that, similar to women, men
with higher self-perceived mate value exhibit more selective
mate preferences across diverse characteristics in their female
partners. Conversely, one other-rated indicator of men's mate
value, facial attractiveness, showed fewer links to mate

preferences, although it is noteworthy that of the few emergent
relationships, all were in the direction of higher value men
expressing more selective preferences. Future researchers
should build on this work, and earlier studies (Buston & Emlin,
2003; Edlund & Sagarin, 2010) to determine (1) whether other
objective markers of mate value (social status, intelligence, and
income) are effective predictors of men's mate preferences and
(2) whether contextual changes in self-perceived mate value
can alter individuals' expectations in the realm of mate
preferences.
