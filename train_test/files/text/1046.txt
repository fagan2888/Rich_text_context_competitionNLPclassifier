Study objective: To investigate whether the income distribution in a Russian region has a ``contextual''
effect on individuals' self rated health, and whether the regional income distributions are related to
regional health differences.
Methods: The Russia longitudinal monitoring survey (RLMS) is a survey (n = 7696) that is representative of
the Russian population. With multilevel regressions both individual as well as contextual effects on self
rated health were estimated.
Main results: The effect of income inequality is not negative on men's self rated health as long as the level
of inequality is not very great. When inequality levels are high, however, there is a tendency for men's
health to be negatively affected. Regional health differences among men are in part explained by regional
income differences. On the other hand, women do not seem to be affected in the same way, and individual
characteristics like age and educational level seem to be more important.
Conclusions: It seems that a rise in income inequality has no negative effect on men's self rated health as
long as the level of inequality is not very great. On the other hand, when inequality levels are higher a rise
tends to affect men's health negatively. A curvilinear relation between self rated health and income
distribution is an interesting hypothesis. It could help to explain the confusing results that arise when you
look at countries with a high degree of income inequality (USA) and those with lower income inequality
(for example, Japan and New Zealand).
Since the fall of the communist regime in the early 1990s,
and with the introduction of ``shock therapy'' in January
1992, Russia has experienced dramatic economic and
social changes. In response to these, Russian public health
deteriorated with an increasing mortality and a falling life
expectancy.1 Between 1994 and 1998 the life expectancy
recovered somewhat, but only to start falling again in 1999
and 2000.2
The economic changes have been difficult for many
Russians. Rising unemployment rates and large groups of
people falling into poverty can illustrate this. The income
distribution has widened substantially, but only a very small
group of Russians have benefited economically from the
recent changes. A good example of this is that about 80% of
the citizens in the city of Taganrog (Rostovskaya Oblast),
judged their financial situation to have worsened between
1988 and 1998.3
Moreover, there is good reason to believe that different
parts of Russia have been affected differently economically,
socially, and in health, with some parts of the country
managing the transition better than others. Shkolnikov and
Cornia4 found a greater deterioration in life expectancy in the
north and northwest regions between 1989 and 1994. Both
the Moscow and St Petersburg areas experienced the biggest
deteriorations during this period and therefore, they con-
cluded, the decreases cannot be attributable to the economic
crisis as these two areas performed relatively better than
other areas during this period. Walberg et al5 concluded that
the decline in Russian life expectancy cannot be attributed to
impoverishment only. Regions that have experienced the
most dramatic transition, with, for example, increasing
income inequalities as one result, have lost their social
cohesion and therefore experienced a rise in mortality. The
economic and social changes during the early 1990s, created
a psychosocial stress among people that led to harmful
behaviours such as increased heavy alcohol consumption or
increased criminality.
Kennedy et al6 found an association between indicators of
social capital and life expectancy in the Russian regions.
Regions with higher mistrust in government, higher crimin-
ality, worse working relations, and poorer engagement in
politics also had a lower life expectancy. Therefore, they
suggested ``... that indicators of social capital could account
for an important portion of the cross-sectional variation in
mortality and life expectancy across the regions of the
country.'' (page 2037). Moreover, the relation between social
capital and mortality persisted when they controlled for per
capita income and poverty.
Thus, it seems that poverty in itself cannot explain regional
variations in mortality or life expectancy, but rather social
and social-psychological factors associated with the economic
and political changes.
There has been a lively discussion in the medical and social
sciences about whether (and how) income inequalities can
affect the health of the individual.7­9 Wilkinson7 suggested
that the distribution of incomes in a society may affect
people's health, at least in economically developed societies.
It is hypothesised that wide differences in income will
negatively affect social cohesion and feelings of trust and
solidarity, which in turn will affect all members of the
society, but in particular those in a disadvantaged social
position. These will feel disadvantaged compared with others
higher up. Lynch et al9 are sceptical about this ``psychosocial''
interpretation and argue that ``Interpretation of links
between income inequality and health must begin with the
structural causes of inequalities, and not just focus on
perceptions of that inequality.'' (page1200) Income inequal-
ity is a consequence of several structural processes and these
also affect the individual's possibilities of getting, for
example, education, occupation, food, housing, health
389

services, etc, which all are related to health. In other words,
to understand the relation between income inequality and
health, you should focus on those processes that create these
inequalities. It is reasonable to believe that these structural
processes have both psychosocial as well as material effects
on health.10 However, the question is how to separate them.
It has also been argued that attention should be directed
away from income inequality. Deaton11 argues that income
inequality in itself does not have any causal effect on
population health and therefore any relation found can be
explained by some other factors, for example, poverty.
Instead, he argues, focus should be on the health promoting
role of income.
Several studies have examined the relation between
income inequality and public health in various countries
and the results are mixed. Kennedy et al8 found from the USA
that people living in states with the greatest inequality were
more likely to report poor health than others. On the other
hand, evidence from New Zealand (mortality) and Japan
(self rated health) show no, or only a very weak, associa-
tion.12 13 A Canadian study showed some evidence that higher
income inequality was related to better health, but the most
important factor, however, seemed to be household income.14
Studies on this topic conducted in Russia or other eastern
European countries are more sparse. Bobak et al15 found no
relation between income inequality and self rated health in
seven post-communist countries. Instead, individual factors
such as education and material deprivation were most
strongly related to self rated health.
The aim of the study is (1) to investigate whether in the
regions of Russia income distribution has a ``contextual''
effect on people's self rated health, and (2) whether regional
income distributions are related to regional differences in
health.
DATA AND METHODS
The Russia longitudinal monitoring survey (RLMS) is a
survey that is representative of the Russian population and
has been carried out at repeated intervals since 1992. It is
obviously very difficult to obtain a sample that is representa-
tive of the entire Russian population. In brief, the selection
procedure entailed the following three steps. (1) In accor-
dance with certain criteria (including degree of urbanisation)
a number of regions were selected that together would
represent the vast country's enormous heterogeneity. (2) A
number of electoral districts were chosen at random. (3) A
register of households in each electoral district was used to
select a total of some 7000 households. The response rate was
around 90% for the earliest surveys and about 80% for the
later ones. In this paper, the 1998 survey is analysed (a
detailed explanation of the study design and selection
strategy is available on the RLMS web site http://
www.cpc.unc.edu/rlms). It contains 7696 interviews (3306
men and 4390 women).
Thus, RLMS is designed to obtain a national representative
sample; results at the regional level may therefore not be
representative. Thus, to control for statistical problems
related to the sample design and to separate the ``con-
textual effects'' (that is, the effects of group level properties
on the individuals) from individual ones, a multilevel
technique with random intercepts was used, whereby you
can control for some statistical problems (for example,
clustering) and thereafter estimate both individual and
contextual effects.16­18 The statistical software used was
MLwiN 1.10. The multilevel model includes five levels, but
only the regional level and the individual level will be
commented on here. The other three levels--that is, family,
census district, and population centre--are included only to
control for possible design problems related the sampling
procedure.
The logic of the regression models look like this;
b0
is the intercept, and is allowed to vary on five levels: i
(individual), j (family), k (census district), l (population
centre), and m (primary sampling unit, i.e. region).
b1
represents the effects of the independent variables (here
illustrated by x1ijklm
) at individual level.
b2
represents the effects of the independent variables (here
illustrated by x2jklm
) at family level.
b3
represents the effects of the independent variables (here
illustrated by x3m
) at regional level.
Accordingly, the models allow for random intercepts and
fixed effects, which means that the intercepts are allowed to
vary between, for example, regions, but the slopes (b) are
assumed to be equal.19
Dependent variable
Self rated health is measured on a five point scale indicating
whether the respondent rates their health as ``very good'' (5),
``good'' (4), ``average'' (3), ``poor'' (2) or ``very poor'' (1).
Independent variables
The household's reported total income was used to estimate
the individual's economic situation, the mean income level of
each region, and the regional income distribution. To control
for family composition, the household's total income was
divided by the number of household members. However, the
household members were weighted differently. The first
adult person in the household had a weight of 1.0, while all
others received a weight of 0.8. The most appropriate
equivalence scale has been discussed earlier,20 and the choice
made here was based on a study from another post-Soviet
economy--that is, Estonia.21 The Gini coefficient was used to

measure regional income inequality and was calculated as
follows;
N represents the number of households, m is the mean
household income, yi
symbolises household ``I'', and yj
symbolises household ``j''. As we do not have any expressed
hypotheses about how the relation between income inequal-
ity and health may look like, linear or non-linear, we tested
several models. A non-linear model, where the Gini
coefficient was squared, fitted the data best and was
therefore finally kept.
Both at individual and regional level the natural logarithm
of household income is used, as it is assumed that the
possible effects on health will stagnate at higher income
levels, both at individual and regional level.
Background variables
Several background variables are controlled for in the analy-
ses (models 2­4). These are; age (in years), marital status
(married or not married), type of settlement ((1) urban, (2)
urban-rural, (3) rural) and education ((1) graduate school,
(2) university, academy, (3) technical, medical, music,
pedagogical, art school, (4) vocational technical school with
a secondary education, (5) vocational school without a
secondary education, (6) professional courses).
RESULTS
Comparisons and interpretations from table 1 must be carried
out with caution, as the results may not be representative for
each region. However, we can see significant ``regional''
variations in self rated health as well as in income and
income distribution. One region (Kabardino-Balkarija, Zolskij
Rajon) was excluded from further analyses, because of its
great deviation from the other regions and it was therefore
considered an outlier (see fig 1).
In tables 2 and 3, men and women were analysed
separately.
From model 1 (tables 2 and 3) we can see that the average
self rated health for men is 3.19, and for women 2.87 (see
intercept). As expected, men rate their health better than
women. There also seems to be, both for men and women, a
significant, but not particularly large, regional proportion,
2.28% and 1.73%, men and women respectively, of the total
variation. In model 2 several background variables were
included. Age, marital status (for men), and education but
not type of settlement had a significant effect on self rated
health. In other words, older people, unmarried men
(compared with married men), and the lower educated
(compared with those with the highest education) tend to
rate their health as worse. The regional variation (that is,
variance explained by region) seemed to increase somewhat
among men (+8.3%, that is, from 2.28% to 2.47%) but
decreased considerably among women (242%). In model 3,
the household's total income was introduced to the model
together with the mean household income of the region.

None of these economic measures seemed to relate to the
individual's perceived health. The regional variation
remained the same, both for men and women.
Finally in model 4, regional income distribution (Gini) was
included. For men (table 2), the squared Gini coefficient was
significantly related to self rated health, showing a curve-
linear relation. Thus, at ``lower'' levels of inequality an
increase seems to slightly improve self rated health, but at
``higher'' levels an increase seems to have a negative effect on
self rated health. However, the effect does not seem to be very
strong. Among women there was a similar, but weak and
non-significant, curve-linear relation (table 3). For a graphi-
cal presentation, see figure 2.
It is equally interesting to look at changes in the regional
variation. Among men, variance explained by region changed
from 2.48% (model 3) to 1.36% (model 4), which is a 45%
reduction. However, there was no change at all for women.
DISCUSSION
May biases in the analysed data have affected the results? It
should be noted that the data are not necessarily representa-
tive at the regional level. However, this is not a particular
problem because the aim of the study was to analyse the
possible relation between income inequality and self rated
health, and not to present representative estimations of levels
of household income, self rated health, etc. Moreover, the
used multilevel design is intended to control for possible
statistical problems, for example, clustering. Another pro-
blem is the level of aggregation of income inequality. In this
study the primary sampling units were used because this is as
close as we can get to where the federal political and
economic structures are formed. At the same time it is a level
that forms a significant cultural identity and to where people

can relate. Of course it would be possible to analyse
inequalities on other levels, for example cities, neighbour-
hoods, families, etc, to where people can relate. However, it
can still be argued that the chosen level of aggregation here is
meaningful, both from the individual perspective and from a
macro structural one.
Self rated health was analysed as a continuous variable,
but as it is unclear whether this variable forms a continuum
or not,22 an additional multilevel logistic regression was
performed. However, the results were very similar and the
less complex models were kept.
It seems that a rise in income inequality has no negative
effect on men's self rated health as long as the level of
inequality is not very high. On the other hand, at higher
levels of inequality, a rise tends to affect men's health
negatively. Women do not seem to be affected in the same
way. Individual characteristics like age and educational level
seem more important. A curvilinear relation between self
rated health and income distribution is an interesting
hypothesis. It could help to explain the confusing results
that arise when you look at countries with a high degree of
income inequality (USA) and those with lower income
inequality (for example, Japan and New Zealand).
The regional variation in self rated health cannot be
considered large in relation to the total variation and this is,
of course, not very surprising. It is more interesting to look at
the changes in regional variation between the models.
Among women, there was only a change when individual
characteristics (age, marital status, type of settlement, and
education) were included. Perhaps these factors are more
important in explaining female regional variations in self
rated health. For men however, the regional variation in self
rated health declined when income inequality was taken into
account. Moreover, we can conclude that the effect that
income inequality has on men's self rated health is not
attributable to their own economic situation or that of the
region in which they live.
Thus, regional income inequality in Russia seems to affect
male self rated health to some extent, even though the effect
cannot be seen as very strong. For women, it seems that other
factors are more important. Why men seem to be more
affected by income inequalities than women is a matter of
speculation, but men and women may well be differently
sensitive to different exposures.

Key points
N Regional income inequality in Russia seems to affect
male self rated health to some extent, even though the
effect cannot be seen as very strong.
N The effect that income inequality has on men's self
rated health is not attributable to their own economic
situation or that of the region in which they live.
N For women, it seems that other factors (age, marital
status, type of settlement, and education) are more
important.

Relationships, context, and embedded systems: illustrating complexity science
Increasingly attention is focusing on the
inadequacies of attempting to understand
and address many contemporary health-
care problems from a reductionist biomedical
paradigm.1­3 Complex adaptive systems the-
ory redirects attention towards understand-
ing the patterns of non-linear behaviour that
emerge from contextually embedded and
highly interactive agents. This picture (view
from Canal Street during ManchesterPride
parade 2004) shows that a broadened
perspective and patterns of order can emerge
from a more careful examination of the
relationships between components (each
window's reflection) and the dynamic inter-
play of embedded contexts.
