Changes in the health and functioning of the Medicare-enrolled
population aged 65 are tracked by using the 1982­20042005
National Long-Term Care Surveys. We found a significant rate of
decline in the prevalence of chronic disability that accelerated from
1982 to 2004. These declines are significant for both persons with
less severe chronic disability, which might be compensated by
modifying the built environment and providing assistive devices,
and for persons with more serious disability, which may be af-
fected by reductions in the incidence and severity of disease
through biomedical interventions. Declines in chronic disability
continued over the 22-year period at a rate fast enough (i.e., 1.52%
per annum) to contribute significantly to the long-term fiscal
stability of the Medicare (and Medicaid) programs. Changes in the
rate and substance of disability declines seem consistent with the
intentions of policy interventions in Medicare and Medicaid.

Declines in the prevalence of chronic disability (i.e., an
impairment in a specific function existing for 90 or more
days), defined in terms of the difficulty in performing both
activities of daily living (ADLs, which include basic personal care
activities such as eating, grooming, and bathing; ref. 1) and
instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs, which include the
capability of performing more complex activities such as meal
preparation, shopping, and managing money; ref. 2) in the U.S.
elderly population can have major effects on the long-run
(75-year) fiscal stability of the Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans
Administration, and Social Security programs and in the rate of
increase of total U.S. health care expenditures. Singer and
Manton (3) showed that if chronic disability continued to decline
at 1.5% per annum, there could be significant improvements in
the long-run fiscal stability of Social Security and Medicare.
Moderation of the rate of growth of Medicare and other public
and private health expenditures, combined with increases in
disposable income and a propensity to increase consumption of
health care as disposable income grows (4), may define new
economic conditions in the U.S. where health improvements and
increasingly productive health care investments (e.g., refs. 5­7)
could become a major stimulus for economic growth and for
research and technical innovation (K.G.M., G. Lowrimore, D.
Tolley, and A. Ullian, unpublished work).
Using data from the National Long-Term Care Survey
(NLTCS), Manton and Gu (8) found a per annum decline in
chronic disability prevalence of 1.7% from 1982 to 1999. Com-
bining NLTCS data with results of early to mid-20th-century
disability trends by Fogel (4) and Costa (9), Manton et al. (10)
calculated active and total-life expectancy estimates from 1935
to 1999, and using projected disability rate changes, they made
active-life expectancy forecasts to 2080. The forecasts showed
significant long-term improvements in the ratio of active to total
life expectancy at age 65, with larger rates of improvement in the
ratio at ages 85. The rapid decline in chronic disability at ages
85 is significant in that it is at such advanced ages where future
long-term improvements in health, functioning, and survival
must occur to maintain the current rate of improvement in the
fiscal status of Medicare and Medicaid to 2050, the year by which
the last of the post-World War II baby boom cohorts has reached
at least age 85.
Linkage of Medicare cost and service use records with NLTCS
survey data allowed the examination of the relation of 1982­1999
changes in Medicare costs to chronic disability declines (11). The
analysis of changes from 1982 to 1999 showed that Medicare per
capita costs, adjusted for inflation, declined significantly in the
growing nondisabled U.S. elderly population aged 65­84,
whereas Medicare per capita costs increased in the severely
disabled and institutional components of the U.S. elderly pop-
ulation, especially at ages 85.
Those analyses showed that, over time, a larger proportion of
Medicare expenditures were being targeted to the most severely
disabled individuals in the U.S. elderly population. The severely
disabled population was, over the same time period, declining in
prevalence. This improved resource targeting may have been
affected in part by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA; ref. 12),
which mandated use of prospective payment systems (PPS) for
postacute care services. PPS reduced the proportion of hospital
discharges to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), although it had
little effect on SNF length of stay. The payment system had
financial incentives to stimulate the growth of rehabilitation and
long-term care (LTC) hospitals for the most severely impaired
(13). Its provisions were adjusted by the Balanced Budget
Refinement Act (BBRA) of 1999.
The combined effects of declines in Medicare per capita costs
in the nondisabled elderly population aged 65­84 and the
increase in the size of the nondisabled population reduced
Medicare expenditures in 1999 by $26 billion; i.e., Medicare
expenditures were $26 billion less than they would have been had
improvements in functional status and declines in Medicare
expenditures related to them not occurred (11). Projection of
these declines to 2009 suggests that a savings of $73 billion, or
17% of all Medicare expenditures expected for the elderly, could
result if declines in chronic disability prevalence continued at
their 1982­1999 rate (21).
Federal actuarial projections suggest that combined Medicare
and Medicaid costs could grow from 6% to 7% of gross domestic
product (GDP) in 2005 to 24% of GDP by 2080, outstripping the

impact of Social Security on the overall U.S. economy because
Social Security costs were projected to remain fairly consistent
at 6­7% of GDP to 2080. Using an economic growth model for
federal research investment developed initially by Romer (14)
and modified for the health care sector by Hall and Jones (22),
Manton et al. (K.G.M., G. Lowrimore, D. Tolley, and A. Ullian,
unpublished work) showed that health status improvements and
associated human capital growth might reduce Medicare and
Medicaid expenditures to a combined cost of 12% of GDP in
2080. That level of health care spending is consistent with levels
of total GDP that could be expected to be dedicated to health
spending (21% of GDP) in a society with a rapidly growing level
of disposable income and a short-term elasticity of spending on
health care of 1.6% (4).
For federal health care expenditures to decline at the pro-
jected rate because of a per annum decline of 1.5% in chronic
disability, future disability declines will have to occur at increas-
ingly older ages. An evaluation of the relative age trajectories of
Medicare and Medicaid costs in the final two years of life shows
that per capita, per annum Medicare costs appear to decline with
age, whereas Medicaid and LTC costs tend to increase. The
reason for this phenomenon is that Medicare covers primarily
short postacute-care institutional stays, whereas Medicaid can
cover LTC costs for the indigent. A cross-over of these costs
currently occurs at 90 years of age (K.G.M., G. Lowrimore, D.
Tolley, and A. Ullian, unpublished work). The importance of the
cross-over is that Medicare costs tend to be more responsive to
biomedical research and therapeutic innovations than LTC
services, which are likely more subject to ``Baumol's disease''
(i.e., resistance to technological innovation) because of the more
personal and labor-intensive, and often less biomedically skilled,
nature of most services provided in LTC settings. Thus, to have
the desired effects on Medicare and Medicaid spending, invest-
ments in biomedical research will likely have to be effective in
improving health and rehabilitating function at increasingly
advanced ages.
Investment in biomedical research and the production of
innovative and more effective therapeutic and preventive med-
ical care are possible explanations for the continued decline in
elderly disability rates. However, it is far too soon to evaluate
fully the population health effects of the recent (1998­2003)
doubling of the National Institutes of Health budget. Other
possible contributing factors include increasing levels of educa-
tion, better nutrition, greater emphasis on exercise at later ages,
and behavioral risk factor changes such as smoking cessation and
moderation of alcohol consumption. Changes in Medicare pro-
visions and reimbursement (e.g., BBA, 1997; BBRA, 1999) may
also have more efficiently directed more and better care to the
more severely disabled elderly (e.g., more emphasis on rehabil-
itation services) through Medicare-reimbursed home health and
SNF care. Also potentially important may be increased use of
home- and community-based LTC services as currently being
evaluated in the Medicaid program. Identifying how each of
these factors may have contributed to the 22-year disability
declines, and possible future changes, is a challenging but
extremely important area of social, public health, and biomedical
research. It may be crucial in dealing effectively with the medical
and LTC needs of baby boomers over the next 45 years.
By using the most recent NLTCS, the current work examines
how age-standardized chronic disability prevalence rates
changed from 1982 to 2005 specific to the level of disability. We
present four specific types of results. First are age-standardized
disability prevalence changes 1982­20042005. Second are dis-
ability changes 1982­20042005 in three broad age groups. Third
are changes 1982­1994 and 1994­20042005 in the prevalence of
light-to-moderate levels of disability (i.e., only limitations in
IADLs and up to four ADLs) and of severe levels of disability
(five or more ADLs or institutional residence). This result is to
determine whether the size of moderately and severely disabled
groups changed at the same, or different, rates over the two time
periods. The prevailing opinion in the literature (e.g., ref. 15)
appears to have been that light or moderate levels of chronic
disabilities declined at a faster rate than higher-level chronic
disability, suggesting that declines may have been primarily the
result of social and housing innovations and expanded use of
assistive devices. The final analysis shows how Medicare costs,
stratified by level of disability and age group, changed over time,
1982­20042005.
Compared with previous work, a number of specific changes
in sample weighting and disability status determination were
made to improve longitudinal estimates of disability declines
calculated from the five NLTCS 1982­1999. These measurement
and sample weight calculation changes are discussed in Materials
and Methods.
Results
Age-Standardized Disability Trends: 1999­20042005. The overall
declines in chronic disability prevalence rates observed in 1982­
1999 (8) continued, and they accelerated to 20042005 (see
Table 1). The prevalence of nondisabled persons older than 65
years increased from 73.5% in 1982 (standardized to the 2004
age distribution) to 81.0% in 20042005. This decline in the
chronic disability prevalence rate is from 26.5% in 1982 to 19.0%
in 20042005, or a 1.52% per annum relative decline. The
1982­20042005 decline of 7.5% is highly significant (t  18.8,
P  0.0001), as is the 2.2% decline observed 1999­20042005
(t  5.8, P  0.0001). Indeed, each intersurvey disability decline
is statistically significant with the exception of the short 1982­
1984 period (t  0.7, P  0.48). The 1982­20042005 rate of
decline is slightly higher than the 1.5% argued to be needed on
a long-term basis to preserve the fiscal stability of the Social
Security and Medicare programs (3). The per annum rate of
decline was 1.8% during the 1994­1999 period, and it increased
further to 2.2% for the 1999­20042005 survey interval. Thus,
the decline in the acceleration of the rate of disability suggests
that the average rate of change may improve further in the
future.
Reported declines before 20042005 (cf. 8) are reduced in
magnitude in Table 1 by roughly 0.2% because of age standard-
ization to the 2004 population age distribution. The distribution

of ages in the older-than-65 population shifted upward in 2004
to more advanced ages (e.g., 85), ages with typically higher
base prevalence rates in 1982 than in 20042005. Thus, age
standardization is necessary to control for changes over time in
the age distribution of Medicare enrollees aged 65.
The range of estimates is consistent with the 1.7% decline
observed in 1982­1999, although recent Census Bureau sample
weight adjustments cause more of the long-term decline in
chronic disability to be attributed to the 1999 to 20042005
period. The disability declines are thus distributed over a longer
time period but with a consistent acceleration of the decline of
disability prevalence. The 0.6% per annum rate of change in
1982­1984 is similar to the 0.6% per annum rate estimated by
Fogel (4) and Costa (9). This per annum rate of prevalence rate
declines then accelerates over the 22-year period of study (1.1%
1984­1989; 1.3% 1989­1994; 1.8% 1994­1999; 2.2% 1999­
20042005).
Changes in specific disability levels 1982­20042005 are also
documented in Table 1. The age-adjusted prevalence of institu-
tional residence declined from 7.5% in 1982 to 4.0% in 2004
2005 (a 46.7% relative decline). The decline is smaller, 3.5% to
3.2%, for severely disabled community residents with five or six
ADLs, probably because large numbers of persons who did not
enter nursing homes are likely to be found in this disability
category. Recent changes in the nature of institutionalization
(e.g., the emergence of assisted-living options 1994­1999, which
continued to 2004) and in reimbursement of Medicare hospice,
home health assistance (HHA) and SNF benefits as well as
improvements in functional rehabilitation and, more recently,
regenerative medicine likely have helped reduce the proportion
of the elderly and the very elderly in LTC institutions. Combin-
ing the three most highly disabled groups (i.e., persons with three
or more ADL impairments in the community and persons in
institutions), the decline is from 13.9% in 1982 to 11.1% in
20042005, or a relative drop of 20.1%, which is quite large given
an absolute increase in the community-resident population with
three or four ADLs.
Age-Specific Changes in Chronic Disability Prevalence. In Table 2, we
examine disability changes within three age groups (65­74,
75­84, and 85). Between 1982 and 20042005, there is a 6.2%
relative increase, from 85.8% to 91.1%, in the proportion
nondisabled at ages 65­74. At ages 75­84, the relative increase
is 12.6%, from 69.3% to 78.1%. At ages 85, the relative
increase is larger (32.6%), from 37.9% to 50.3%. Each of the
age-specific increases is also highly significant (e.g., at age 65­74,
t  11.3, P  0.0001; at ages 85, t  8.6, P  0.0001).
The larger relative rate of improvement at higher ages is related
to large declines in institutional use at ages 75. The decline, from
8.1% to 4.2%, is almost 49% at ages 75­84. At ages 85 the decline
in institutionalization, 27.2% to 15.6%, is almost 43%.
At all ages there are also large declines in the IADL-only and
one-to-two ADL-impaired groups. A possible explanation is the
increased availability of assistive devices and modifications in the
built environment, although some of these declines may also be
because of earlier and better intervention in disability-related
disease processes (e.g., better interventions in diabetes manage-
ment; ref. 16). Only the three-or-four ADL-impaired group
shows increases for age groups 75­84 and 85. Further analyses
should focus on why this specific level of disability should be
resistant to change at ages 75.
Early (1982­1994) and Late (1994­2004) Changes in Moderate and
Severe Disability. We compare rates of decline in the light-to-
moderately (i.e., those with up to four ADLs, including persons
with impairment in at least one IADL) and severely (five or more
ADLs or in nursing home residence) disabled groups for 1982­
1994 and 1994­20042005 in Table 3. The selection of 1994 as
a division point is motivated partly because it is roughly halfway
through the current NLTCS series and partly because it may
reflect certain turning points in specific health and health care
processes. For example, in 1990 cancer mortality rates started to
decline in the U.S., partly because of treatment innovation for
specific solid tumors (e.g., for early onset, aggressive female
breast cancer) and partly because of public health interventions
(e.g., cohort-related reductions in male smoking rates). There
also emerged an economically viable U.S. biotechnology sector
during this time period, and biomedical research spending has
been increased significantly.

group increased between the two time periods (0.9% to 1.7% per
annum) but not as rapidly in either time period as declines in the
severely impaired groups (five or six ADLs or institutionalized),
where the per annum rate of improvement increased from 1.4%
to 2.4%. Thus, the rate of improvement for the most severely
disabled groups is more rapid in both time periods than for
light-to-moderately disabled groups. This finding contradicts the
view that long-term declines in chronic disability prevalence are
primarily because of changes in the built environment and
improvements in assistive devices, and it suggests that biomedical
innovations in the management of diseases leading to serious
disability are increasing in importance post-1994. These esti-
mates are statistically significantly different both over time and
across disability level based on a cross-time comparison of
roughly 30,000 NLTCS cases followed from 1982 to 1994 (i.e.,
20,000 cases in the 1982­1984 NLTCS plus aged-in cohorts in
1989 and 1994) vs. 30,000 cases followed 1994­20042005, or
roughly 288,000 person-years of experience 1982­1994 vs.
200,000 person-years of experience observed between 1994 and
20042005.
Changes in the Distribution of Medicare Expenditures over Disability
Levels and Age. Table 4 shows temporal changes (1982­2004) in
the average level of Medicare Part A per capita costs, adjusted
for the medical care consumer price index, over disability level.
We examine Part A Medicare expenditures because they reflect
acute hospitalization, HHA, and SNF use; i.e., more medically
intense types of Medicare services. In addition, Medicare Part A
data are complete with diagnoses back to 1984 when the acute
hospital prospective payment system was instituted. Diagnoses
for Part B services, which are heavily weighted to physician or
outpatient services, are only available since 1991. We performed
analyses both with Part A and total (A  B) Medicare expenses
and found similar trends. Part A data, representing use of more
medically intense services, tended to show clearer trends and
patterns. In addition, Part A funding directly involves the
Medicare Trust Fund, and it has less flexibility to respond to the
cost of Medicare service use increases than Part B, which is
funded from premiums (supplementary medical insurance) and
general revenue.
There are two general sets of expenditure trends: 1982­1989
and 1994­2004. The highest average level of Medicare costs was
incurred for persons with five or six ADLs, and it occurs in all
years and for both age strata. Table 4 shows that costs at high
levels of disability decreased from 1982 to 1989 [possibly because
of the effects of the 1983­1984 introduction of the diagnosis-
related groupprospective payment system (DRGPPS), which
reduced acute hospital lengths of stay and costs, and imposed
restrictions on postacute HHA and SNF use], increased in
1989­1994 (with HHA and SNF benefit expansion because of
the Duggan vs. Bowen and Fox vs. Bowen decisions), and then
declined in 1999 and 2004 after passage of the 1997 BBA and
1999 BBRA, which enacted and fine-tuned a PPS for HHA and
SNF benefits.
Medicare costs for community-dwelling persons with five or
six ADLs declined in 1994­2004, whereas costs for persons in
nursing homes increased or were stable, which may reflect a
shifting of the most severely impaired cases into postacute care
institutions and a movement of less disabled persons out of
institutions into community residences because of declines in the

rate of discharge from acute-stay hospitals to SNFs. One of the
striking, consistent trends was the large decline in inflation-
adjusted Part A costs for the nondisabled population that was
evident across the period 1982­2004.
Table 4 also contains costs stratified on age. Two groups (for
persons aged 65­84 and those aged 85) showed different cost
trends for the 1982­1999 period. It is significant that for persons
with three or more ADLs the average adjusted Part A costs
declined for persons aged 65­84. The Medicare Part A costs for
persons older than 85 showed declines for persons with one to six
ADLs who were community residents. The cost changes in 1999­
2004 for persons age 85 appear to reflect refinements made to the
PPS system for HHA and SNF made in the 1999 BBRA. Thus,
Medicare Part A cost dynamics in 1982­2004 specific to disability
level and age seem to have beneficial properties that interact with
the long-term changes in disability prevalence rates.
Discussion
The 1982­20042005 data show several clear trends. The rate of
decline in chronic disability prevalence accelerates from 1982 to
20042005, starting at 0.6% per annum in 1982­1984 and
increasing to almost four times that level (2.2%) by 1999­2004
2005. The rate of decline for persons with five or more ADLs
accelerates more in 1994­20042005 than 1982­1994.
A major health care dynamic in 1982­20042005 has been a
change in the management of severely disabled persons, espe-
cially in long-term institutional care. Before the 1980s, institu-
tional LTC was primarily conceived of as residential and housing
services and maintenance care, which was not well developed
medically or for rehabilitation (17). In the 1960s and 1970s, many
elderly persons, especially those with depression and severe
dementia and without significant socioeconomic resources, were
in state mental hospitals. With the development of pharmaceu-
tical treatments (e.g., Thorazine) for select mental health prob-
lems and the deinstitutionalization movement in the 1960s,
1970s, and 1980s, younger and middle-aged psychiatric patients
were increasingly treated in the community, allowing numerous
state mental hospitals to be closed.
Many elderly patients with depression and dementia and without
viable private community residence options were discharged to
nursing homes reimbursed by Medicaid. The residential use of
nursing homes was facilitated by the 1955 National Housing Act and
the 1965 implementation of Medicare and Medicaid, both of which
promoted nursing home construction. The peak number of nursing
homes in the U.S. was reached in 1985. From 1985 to 1995, the
nursing home population grew more slowly than the U.S. elderly
population, in part because of more stringent regulation of HHA
and SNF use after the institution of PPS in 1983­1984 for acute-care
hospital reimbursements.
In 1988, the Catastrophe Care Act was instituted and then
rescinded. In response, Medicare SNF and HHA regulations
were loosened in 1989 (in part because of the Duggan vs. Bowen
court decision in 1988), which allowed rapid increases in Medi-
care SNF and HHA use from 1989 to 1996. Because Medicare
SNF care is intended to be postacute care and strongly limited
in duration (100 days), the increased availability of postacute
care tended to reduce traditional nursing home admissions.
Medicare expenditures on SNF and HHA service grew rapidly
until 1997, when those benefits were restricted by the BBA. For
example, the BBA instituted a PPS system for SNFs with
reimbursements weighted by how much rehabilitation was un-
dertaken. Associated with changes in Medicare policy was the
improved economic status of the elderly, which gave them
additional private payment options such as the use of assisted-
living facilities.
More fine-grained analyses of the specific biological mecha-
nisms underlying the long-term disability decline will be neces-
sary to determine which biomedical research and treatment
innovation investments will best sustain the rate of declines in
functional disability at late ages in the future. Continuing
progress will require significantly greater biomedical research
expenditures on fundamental mechanisms (i.e., at the cellular
and molecular level) of chronic disease and human senescence
(K.G.M., G. Lowrimore, D. Tolley, and A. Ullian, unpublished
work). Such fundamental discoveries will help enhance basic
rehabilitation efforts at later ages through improved understand-
ing of neural and muscle function and of metabolism at the
molecular, cellular, and mitochondrial levels (e.g., 18, 19). This
endeavor will involve looking in greater detail at the genetic and
molecular basis of disease processes and senescence to develop
effective interventions at advanced ages (e.g., ages 95 in the
post-2015­2020 period). It is thus heartening that the rate of
disability reduction was found to be higher at advanced ages
(e.g., ages 85) in the NLTCS data series and that NLTCS data
linked to diagnostic records in Medicare files showed that
cognitive impairment caused by circulatory events (especially
stroke) declined significantly to 1999 (20). Reductions in cog-
nitive impairment may set the stage for further physical reha-
bilitation because of the greater compliance capacity in cogni-
tively intact persons.
Further analyses also need to be done with the 1982­2004
2005 NLTCS linked to Medicare (and possibly Medicaid) service
use, diagnoses, and expenditure data. With the six surveys
spanning 1982­2004, and continuous Medicare history files (i.e.,
services and expenditures recorded on a daily basis), more
detailed longitudinal analyses of individual and cohort disability
and health dynamics can be undertaken. Knowledge of those
dynamics will also be important in translating biomedical and
rehabilitation innovations that can reduce chronic disability at
more advanced ages in the U.S. population.
Materials and Methods
The NLTCS was conducted in 1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, 1999, and
20042005. The NLTCS sample is drawn from Medicare enroll-
ment files covering 97% of the U.S. elderly population. Each
survey record is linked to continuous Medicare service use and
cost data from the date that each NLTCS sample person passed
age 65 or was included in the NLTCS sample above age 65 in
1982.
Interviewing is done in two phases. The first is a screen that
determines whether the person is chronically disabled (i.e., for
90 days) on at least one of seven ADLs and nine IADLs. The
presence of nursing home or institutional residence (and starting
in 1994, assisted-living residence) is determined on the screen
instrument. The NLTCS definition of institutional residence
requires that medical services be available at the facility on a
24-h basis. The NLTCS sample size is roughly 20,000 persons at
each wave, with 15,000 persons continuing from earlier waves
and 5,000 persons drawn in a supplementary sample, aged
65­69, who became Medicare-eligible between NLTCS waves.
The sample supplement aged 65­69 maintains the national
representativeness of the NLTCS for the entire elderly Medicare
beneficiary population, and it replaces long-term (5-year) sam-
ple attrition caused by death. In 1994, 1999, and 20042005,
oversamples of persons aged 95 were drawn. These over-
samples may be critical for designing interventions to maintain
disability rate declines in the long run. Medicare vital statistic
records provide the exact date of death for all Medicare enroll-
ees selected into the NLTCS sample.
The second phase is a detailed community or institutional
interview that generates more comprehensive data on disabili-
ties, LTC not covered by Medicare, residential characteristics,
socioeconomic traits, and family and informal LTC caregiver
characteristics. This phase takes roughly 55­60 min. Additional
risk factors [e.g., smoking, body mass index (BMI), and BMI
change] and nutritional measures have been added to the

NLTCS instrument. In each NLTCS, innovations have been
made in the community interview content (e.g., next-of-kin
surveys 1982­1984 and 1999­20042005; informal caregiver
surveys in 1982, 1989, 1999, and 20042005; a health insurance
module in 1989), some involving ancillary respondents. Rosters
are made of caregivers, children, and family members. Small
additions have also been made to the screening instrument, e.g.,
adding veteran status in 2004.
The NLTCS began in 1982, when, not knowing the prevalence
of chronic disability in 1982, the Census Bureau selected 55,000
persons over age 65 from Medicare enrollment lists. This sample
was organized into roughly 100 reduction sets, which were to be
drawn until 6,000 persons chronically disabled (90 days) in at
least one of seven ADLs and nine IADLs were identified on the
screen. After 35,789 persons were screened, 6,393 with chronic
disability were identified, with an additional 1,992 identified as
living in institutions.
The second NLTCS was conducted in 1984 to do a prepost
analysis of the consequences of the hospital DRGPPS for the
Medicare elderly population. Cost constraints required that the
sample be reduced by using roughly 45% (12,100) of the 25,000
persons not disabled in the 1982 sample of 35,789. The prepost
analyses were successful in identifying which chronically disabled
groups were most susceptible to PPS-induced changes in acute
hospital use (e.g., decreased length of stay).
The NLTCS sample is followed longitudinally, but it can also
be assessed cross-sectionally. Supplemental samples of persons
reaching age 65 between surveys are cross-sectionally con-
structed for each NLTCS, but they are followed longitudinally
through later NLTCS waves. This sample replenishment design
was used in 1984, 1989, 1994, 1999, and 20042005. Six surveys
now follow 22 years of disability and 23 years of mortality
changes and Medicare service use in a total of 49,000 sample
persons, and they cover (to 2005) almost 30,000 deaths (with
Medicare mortality and service records updated on a quarterly
and an annual basis, respectively). The NLTCS now represents
roughly 500,000 person-years of experience, which is sufficient to
support subgroup analyses and accurately portray overall, co-
hort, and period-specific disability trends.
The 1989 and 1999 NLTCS had small sample weight anomalies
because each sample was necessarily designed before the 1990
and 2000 decennial census counts were available. Specifically,
both the 1989 and 1999 NLTCS samples were based on 9-year
projections of population components (e.g., by age, sex, race, and
institutional status), with exact estimates known with precision
only from the decennial census after April 1, the date of the
sample draw. As a consequence, there were changes in sample
weight calculations after the 1989 and 1999 NLTCS field periods.
In 1999, the Census Bureau institutional population estimates for
poststratification weighting based on the 9-year projections did
not reflect the emergence of the assisted-living phenomenon or
the decline in the size of the nursing home population, which
were detected in the NLTCS because the sample was based on
a list of individual Medicare enrollees.
In 20042005, there was an almost 6-month delay in inter-
viewing the population sample, which had two effects. First, the
proportion of the sample drawn on April 1, 2004, who died
before the interview attempt increased from 5.9% (in 1999) to
9.5% (in 20042005). Mortality between the screen interview
and the detailed interview was nearly unchanged between 1999
(0.26%) and 2004 (0.34%). Second, persons aged 65­74 were far
more difficult to locate in 2004 than in past NLTCS despite an
enhanced tracking procedure. An analysis of the difficult-to-
locate 65- to 74-year-olds revealed that they had very low
Medicare costs, especially for Part A services. These highly
mobile 65- to 74-year-olds with low medical expenditures and
service use were the major cause of the response rate decline
from 95% (in all prior waves) to 91% in 20042005.
To deal with potential bias in health and functional trait
estimates caused by the higher nonresponse rates in 20042005,
we compared Medicare Part A expenditures in nonrespondents
with Part A expenditures in the total sample. Part A was used
rather than total Medicare expenditures because persons using
Part A services (inpatient hospital care, HHA, and SNF) are
generally more ill than persons using Part B services, which
involve predominantly outpatient and physician care. Part A
expenditures were used to generate a ratio for solving a simple
equation to estimate the mix of healthy and nonhealthy persons
(stratified by age) in the larger 20042005 nonresponse (nonlo-
catable) group. Knowledge of this ratio and Part A costs in the
disabled and nondisabled groups allowed us to impute the health
and functional status of nonrespondents by using an independent
data source (Medicare Part A service use files) with 100%
sample coverage. This analysis indicated that in the 20042005
population aged 65­74, Part A costs for nonrespondents are
lower than for the total population, suggesting that 65- to
74-year-old nonrespondents are healthier than the total 65- to
74-year-old population.
To keep our results consistent over time, we used Medicare
Part A data to adjust for nonresponse bias in all five prior
NLTCS. This adjustment had a larger effect than age-specific
sample weight adjustments of the 1989 and 1999 NLTCS, and it
produced a smoother (more consistent over time) set of cross-
temporal results than in previous analyses because additional
cross-sectional sampling artifacts were removed (see Table 1 and
ref. 8). Disability status for the 20042005 sample was coded in
a fashion fully consistent with earlier years. The screener was
used to assess disability prevalence for the screened-in sample,
and the detailed interviews were used to assess disability prev-
alence and LTC use for the longitudinal sample.
