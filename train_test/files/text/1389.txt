Background: Infection with herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2) currently affects approximately 22% of adult Amer-
icans and increased markedly in prevalence between the late
1970s and early 1990s. Although some estimates of the costs of
prevalent disease due to HSV-2 are available, selection of
interventions to prevent HSV-2 infection, as well as evaluation
of their potential cost-effectiveness, should take into account
projected future costs that will result if the epidemic is left
unchecked.
Goal: The goal was to estimate the future health and eco-
nomic consequences attributable to the HSV-2 epidemic in the
absence of interventions to slow the epidemic.
Study Design: A mathematical model was constructed to
project future increases in HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United
States. The probability of heterosexual transmission of HSV-2
was estimated from cross-sectional estimates of infection prev-
alence reported by the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES). Per-infection expected costs were
calculated on the basis of data obtained from the published
medical literature.
Results: Without intervention, the prevalence of HSV-2 in-
fection among individuals aged 15 to 39 years was projected to
increase to 39% among men and 49% among women by 2025.
Annual incidence was projected to increase steadily between
2000 and 2025, from 9 to 26 infections per 1000 men and from
12 to 32 infections per 1000 women in this age group. The cost
of incident infections in the year 2000 were estimated to be $1.8
billion; the cost of incident infections was predicted to rise to
$2.5 billion by 2015 and $2.7 billion by 2025. The projected
cumulative cost of incident HSV-2 infections occurring over
the next 25 years was estimated to be $61 billion; at a 3%
discount rate, this sum has a present value of $43 billion.
Conclusion: The costs of incident HSV-2 infection in the
United States are substantial and can be expected to increase
as both the incidence and prevalence of this disease increase in
the first half of the century. The level of resource allocation for
HSV-2 prevention strategies should reflect the economic ben-
efits that would result from control of this epidemic.
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS TYPE 2 (HSV-2) is the most
common cause of ulcerative genital disease in the United
States.1,2 The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey III (NHANES-III) found that by the early 1990s,
almost a quarter of American adults had serologic evidence
of infection with HSV-2, a 30% increase in comparison with
the late 1970s.3,4 In some segments of the population,
HSV-2 antibody seroprevalence is as high as 50%.4
Although HSV-2 infection appears to be extremely com-
mon, only 9% to 50% of HSV-2-infected individuals are
aware of their infection.4­7 This range is due in part to
misdiagnosis of individuals with atypical manifestations of
HSV-2 infection.7 Nonetheless, symptomatic infection with
HSV-2 affects a large proportion of the US population, with
clinical manifestations include primary genital herpes syn-
drome,8 recurrent genital ulceration,9,10 neonatal herpes
simplex virus infection,11,12 and anxiety and depression.13,14
Many symptomatic infections with HSV-2 are acquired
from individuals with asymptomatic HSV-2 infection.15,16
A variety of public health interventions currently being
formulated have the potential to help to slow the spread of
HSV-2. These include serologic screening to identify
asymptomatically infected individuals,17,18 programs to in-
crease condom usage,19,20 suppressive antiviral therapy to

However, the prioritization of investment in such programs
will be influenced not only by the cost of the interventions
but also by the dimensions and costs of the HSV-2 epidemic
that would occur in the absence of any intervention.
Mathematical models are useful tools for comparing the
impact of health care interventions, either before or in lieu
of clinical trials. In addition, mathematical modeling per-
mits estimation of the susceptibility of different facets of
disease epidemiology to intervention. Our objective was to
project the future burden of HSV-2 infection in the United
States, using a mathematical model that incorporated epi-
demiologic trends documented between 1976 and 1994. We
also estimated the per-patient average costs of HSV-2 in-
fection in men and women and combined these costs with
projections of future disease prevalence to estimate the
future costs of HSV-2 infection in the United States.
Methods
The Epidemic Model
We constructed a compartmental model to simulate the
course of the HSV-2 epidemic in individuals aged 15 to 39
years in the United States. We restricted the model to this
age group because the age-related increase in HSV-2 is
attenuated in individuals aged 40 years and older, while
seroprevalence of HSV-2 is low before age 15 years.3,4
Health states in the model were broadly characterized as
infected or susceptible (i.e., uninfected) and were further
stratified by age to capture heterogeneity in risk of infection
and annual live birth rates in different age groups. The
model assumed random, heterosexual mixing of the popu-
lation.25 Infectiousness was assumed to be unrelated to the
presence of symptomatic disease.26
Individuals enter and leave the model at a rate that is
defined by aging of the population and by the rate of
population growth, estimated to be approximately 0.7% per
year.27 This model is described in further detail in Appendix
1.
The rate at which HSV-2 is transmitted between men and
women is a function of the infectiousness of sexual contact
with an infected individual, the rate of partner change
among sexually active individuals, and the prevalence of
infection.25 While estimates of infectiousness of HSV-2
exist,5,28­30 they are derived from monogamous heterosex-
ual couples and may not be applicable to the general het-
erosexual population. Therefore, we estimated age- and
gender-specific rates of acquisition of HSV-2, using the
changes observed in population prevalence of HSV-2 infec-
tion between NHANES-II and NHANES-III. These studies
collected demographic data and serum from large, represen-
tative cohorts of Americans between 1976 and 1980 and
between 1988 and 1994, respectively.3,4
We calculated the rates of infection that would have
been necessary to change the prevalence in a given age
cohort in NHANES-II (e.g., 20­29-year-olds) to the
prevalence observed in the next oldest age cohort (e.g.,
30­39-year-olds) at the time of NHANES-III (Appendix
2). The resulting estimates of initial age- and gender-
specific rates of HSV-2 acquisition are presented in Table
1.3­5,7,9 ­12,27­32,35­37,47,48,54,55,71,89 ­94 Seroprevalence data
from these studies were assumed to apply to the midpoint
of the study. Age-specific seroprevalence estimates for
1978 were used as initial model inputs in the age-strati-
fied model (Table 1). The model was constructed with
use of Microsoft Excel version 6.0 (Microsoft Corpora-
tionTM, Redmond, WA).
Natural History of HSV-2 Infection
In the model, we stratified the infected health state such
that individuals with symptoms were distinguished from
those who were asymptomatic. Individuals who were symp-
tomatic could initially experience a primary HSV-2 syn-
drome2,8 or could progress directly to a health state charac-
terized by relapsing, remitting ulcerative genital disease.9
Estimates of the probability of symptomatic genital her-
pes in an individual infected with HSV-2 vary widely.4,5,7,31
In NHANES-III, only 9% of individuals with serologic
evidence of HSV-2 infection reported a prior diagnosis of
genital herpes.4 However, clinical evidence of genital her-
pes can be demonstrated in approximately 50% of asymp-
tomatic individuals with serologic evidence of infection
followed prospectively by experienced practitioners.7 We
estimated the probability of symptomatic disease by com-
paring the annual incidence of HSV-2 infection projected by
our model with estimates of incident, symptomatic genital
herpes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC, Atlanta).31 Such a comparison suggests that approx-
imately 17% of infected individuals receive medical care for
recognized genital herpes.
The frequency with which individuals relapse varies
widely.10 We estimated a weighted average lifetime number
of relapses by applying a linear decline in annual relapse
rate to published gender-specific distributions of symptom
frequency in the first year of infection32 (Appendix 3).
Pregnancy and Maternal­Fetal Transmission
An important contributor to the health and economic
consequences of HSV-2 relates to infection and pregnancy
and may result either from maternal­fetal transmission of
HSV-2, with resultant infection in the neonate,33­37 or from
the increased risk of cesarean section observed for women
with a history of symptomatic HSV-2 infection.38 We esti-
mated the probability of pregnancy in women by using
average age-specific live birth rates for the US population
from the period between 1980 and 1997.27

FUTURE DIMENSIONS AND COSTS OF THE HSV-2 EPIDEMIC
Modeling maternal­fetal transmission of HSV-2 infec-
tion is complicated by several factors, including possible
changes in sexual behavior and acquisition of HSV-2 infec-
tion associated with pregnancy,39­41 the difficulty in esti-
mating the incidence of spontaneous abortion due to early
trimester infections,42­44 and by protective effects associ-
ated with prior HSV-1 infection.11,12,45,46 The best available
data suggest that neonatal infection with either HSV-1 or
HSV-2 usually occurs following maternal acquisition of
infection in the third trimester of pregnancy.11,12,47,48 We
assumed in the base case analysis that maternal­fetal trans-
mission of HSV-2 occurs exclusively in this context. We
conservatively estimated the risk of third-trimester acquisi-
tion of HSV-2 infection by calculating the decrease in risk
of third-trimester maternal infection that would be neces-
sary to explain the observed incidence of neonatal HSV
infection. These calculations are described in detail in Ap-
pendix 4.
Current published guidelines48­50 advocate cesarean de-
livery in women with known genital herpes if herpetic
lesions are present at the time of labor. However, practicing
obstetricians may perform cesarean delivery for women
with a history of genital herpes, even in the absence of
visible lesions,51,52 and there appears to be an absolute
increase of approximately 20% in the probability of cesar-
ean section among American women with known genital
herpes.38 We estimated the future increase in cesarean sec-
tions among women with symptomatic HSV-2 infection as
the product of the expected number of future term pregnan-
cies and the absolute increase in risk of cesarean section
associated with a history of genital herpes. These calcula-
tions are described in detail in Appendix 5.
Costs
Selected cost inputs for the model are presented in Table
2.2,8,35­38,49,53­57,71,95 Individuals infected with symptomatic
HSV-2 accrued medical costs due to hospitalization (if they
experienced a severe primary HSV-2 syndrome), physician
visits and drugs prescribed for symptomatic episodes and
long-term suppressive therapy, and the excess occurrence of
cesarean sections among women with a history of genital
herpes.38,53 It was assumed that patients would be treated in
accordance with the 1998 CDC Guidelines for Treatment of
Sexually Transmitted Diseases.48
Direct medical costs resulting from neonatal herpes sim-
plex virus infection were estimated as a weighted average of
costs associated with neonatal herpes without sequelae,
neonatal herpes causing death, and neonatal herpes resulting
in long-term disability.35­37,54,55 Medical costs for the first
year were estimated as a weighted average of the costs of
caring for infants with skin, eye, and mucous membrane

of 4 days, equivalent to the duration of recurrent episodes of genital herpes.

disease (SEM), herpetic encephalitis, and disseminated neo-
natal HSV infection.38 Infants who survived with moderate
or severe neurologic sequelae were projected to incur addi-
tional lifetime medical and long-term care costs, based on
published estimates of the future costs of caring for children
with neurologic impairment.37,56 Our model also included
patient time costs associated with travel, waiting room time,
and time spent receiving medical care.
The total future cost of HSV-2 infection for an individual
was discounted to present value with use of a 3% real
discount rate.58 Thus, we estimated the total cost of infec-
tion for that individual as though the entire future stream of
medical and nonmedical costs resulting from HSV-2 infec-
tion had to be paid for at the time of the initial infection. The
annual costs attributable to incident HSV-2 infection in the
United States were estimated as the product of the projected
number of incident infections and the average present value
of the costs attributable to a single HSV-2 infection. Both
undiscounted estimates and estimates discounted to present
value were calculated. All costs were converted to year-
2000 US dollars with use of the US Consumer Price Index
for medical goods and services.57
Sensitivity Analysis
We performed sensitivity analysis by varying param-
eter values over plausible ranges, in order to assess the
robustness of our projections in the face of reasonable
variation in data inputs. We also performed best-case and
worst-case analyses by running the model using upper
and lower bounds of parameters to which our results
proved sensitive.
In our best-case estimates, we assumed that the true
prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the United States. was
represented by upper 95% confidence limits reported from
NHANES-II and by lower 95% confidence limits reported
from NHANES-III. This would result in an attenuated es-
timate of the force of infection acting on the population
during that time period, as the true increase in HSV-2
seroprevalence between 1978 and 1991 would have been
less. Conversely, our worst-case estimates assumed that the
true prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the United States. was
represented by lower 95% confidence limits from
NHANES-II and upper 95% confidence limits from
NHANES-III, which would result in estimation of a larger
force of infection than in the base case simulation.

intermittently for symptomatic relapses were also assumed to have an outpatient clinic visit for approximately one in three recurrences.
Individuals on suppressive therapy were assumed to receive acyclovir at a dosage of 400 mg b.i.d.49 Additionally, individuals on suppressive
therapy were assumed to have one clinic visit every 3 to 6 months.

a value of $1520, so that the excess cost was estimated
to be $310.38
The initial cost of caring for all infected infants, regardless of outcome, was estimated to be $42,600,38 while infants who survived with severe
neurologic sequelae were projected to incur an additional $291,000 in lifetime medical and long-term care costs, and infants with moderate
neurological sequelae were projected to incur an additional $97,000 in costs, for a weighted average cost of $93,000 per neonatal
infection.35,36,54,55 Upper-bound cost estimates are based on estimates of cost associated with Down syndrome.56

FUTURE DIMENSIONS AND COSTS OF THE HSV-2 EPIDEMIC
Upper-bound estimates of HSV-2-related complications
of pregnancy were obtained by increasing the probability of
symptomatic disease in women (which would increase the
risk of cesarean section) and by introducing a 1/2000 risk of
maternal­fetal transmission of HSV-2 for pregnant women
with chronic HSV-2 infection.48 The estimates of neonatal
HSV-2 infection used in the base case represented lower-
bound estimates and thus were also used in the best-case
analysis.
Results
Projected Incidence and Prevalence of HSV-2 Infection
Under base case assumptions, our model predicted that
the prevalence of HSV-2 infection in 1991 would be 18% in
men and 25% in women, compared to the reported preva-
lence of 16% and 23% in NHANES-III. We calibrated our
model by applying an empirically derived correction factor
of 0.9 to rates of partner change for men and women in all
age groups, which resulted in a projected prevalence of 16%
among men and 22% among women. All subsequent pro-
jections were made with use of the calibrated model.
The estimated incidence of HSV-2 infection among those
aged 15 to 39 years in the year 2000 was 25 infections per
1000 women and 19 per 1000 men. Incidence was projected
to increase to 32 cases per 1000 women and 26 cases per
1000 men by 2025 and to remain fairly constant between
2025 and 2050 (Figure 1).
The prevalence of HSV-2 infection in this age group
during the year 2000 was estimated to be 30%, while the
prevalence among men was estimated to be 23%. Preva-
lence was projected to increase sharply between 2000 and
2025, rising to 52% among women and 41% among men,
and to increase more gradually between 2025 and 2050
(Figure 2).
With an assumed constant rate of population growth of
0.7% per year, the number of infected individuals in the age
group of 15 to 39 years was projected to increase from 28
million in 2000 to 43 million by 2015 and to 51 million by
the year 2025.
Per-Infection Costs of Symptomatic Genital Herpes
Assuming that 17% of infected individuals developed
symptomatic genital herpes, we estimated that infected men
would experience an average of 19 lifetime symptom-days,
while infected women would experience an average of 16
lifetime symptom-days, following infection with HSV-2.
The present value (at the time of infection) of the cost of
genital herpes­related symptomatology was estimated to be
$620 for men and $510 for women.
Incidence and Costs of Neonatal HSV-2 Infection
We calibrated the probability of third-trimester infection
to produce a baseline incidence of neonatal HSV-2 infection
of 9.3 cases per 100,000 live births.59 If age-specific live
birth rates were to remain constant, we would project an
incidence of neonatal HSV-2 infection of 29 cases per
100,000 live births by 2025, with the incidence remaining
nearly constant between 2025 and 2050 (Figure 3). The

among men ( ), and among women (). Subse-
quent to 2020, incidence is projected to stabi-
lize or decrease slightly.

average cost of future HSV-2-related complications of preg-
nancy per infected female (including maternal­fetal trans-
mission of HSV-2 infection and excess cesarean sections
among women with known HSV-2 infection) varied accord-
ing to age at infection and was $128 for women aged 15 to
19 years, $160 for women aged 20 to 29 years, and $65 for
women aged 30 to 39 years.
Projected Costs of HSV-2 Infection in the United States
The direct medical costs associated with incident HSV-2
infections in the year 2000 were estimated to be $1.6 billion.
When patients' time, travel, and lost wages were included,
the cost of incident infections increased to $1.8 billion. The
cost of incident infections was projected to rise to $2.5
billion by 2015 and to $2.7 billion by 2025. The cumulative
cost of incident HSV-2 infections occurring between 2000
and 2025 was estimated to be $61 billion. With a 3%
discount rate, this sum has a present value of $43 billion
(Table 3).
Sensitivity Analyses
With use of upper-bound values for transmission rates, it
was projected that nearly 70% of individuals aged 15 to 39
years would be HSV-2-infected by the year 2025, at which

tion. Other projections include an added
1/10,000 probability (), or 1/2000 probability
() of HSV-2 infection in infants of women with
chronic HSV-2 infection. Initial incidence of neo-
natal HSV-2 infection in the base case cali-
brated to be equivalent to the reported inci-
dence of neonatal HSV-2 infection in King
County, WA, between 1978 and 1981 (q). These
projections assume that approximately 80% of
neonatal HSV infection is due to HSV-2 (see ref.
63).

FUTURE DIMENSIONS AND COSTS OF THE HSV-2 EPIDEMIC
time prevalence would be expected to plateau. With use of
lower-bound estimates, it was projected that 30% of indi-
viduals aged 15 to 39 years would be HSV-2-infected by the
year 2015 and 34% would be infected by 2025 (Figure 4).
Our projections of cost proved most sensitive to the
probability of symptomatic disease among infected individ-
uals and to the future prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the
population. Varying the probability of symptomatic infec-
tion from 9% to 50% resulted in lower- and upper-bound
estimates of average symptom-associated costs of $300 and
$1680 for infected men and $230 and $1260 for infected
women.
When we introduced a 1/2000 chance of maternal­fetal
transmission of infection in women with chronic HSV-2
infection, the annual incidence of neonatal HSV-2 infection
increased from 18 infections per 100,000 live births in 1981
to 55 infections per 100,000 live births by 2030 (Figure 3).
When we combined worst-case estimates for HSV-2
prevalence with upper-bound cost estimates, it was esti-
mated that the current cost of incident infections is over $9
billion per year (Table 3). The total projected cost of inci-
dent HSV-2 infections between 2000 and 2025 would be
$269 billion, with a discounted present value of $177 bil-
lion. The use of best-case prevalence and lower-bound cost
estimates resulted in an estimated cost of incident HSV-2
infections of $700 million to $1 billion per year between
2000 and 2025, with cumulative costs of $23 billion; this
sum has a discounted present value of $16 billion.
Discussion
We constructed a mathematical model to project the

HSV-2 necessary to produce the change in seroprevalence
seen in the United States between the late 1970s and early
1990s would project a continued increase in the incidence
and prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the early 21st century.
Our base case simulation projected a modest increase in
incidence between 2000 and 2025; however, because of the
chronic nature of HSV-2 infection, this was projected to
produce an almost twofold increase in the prevalence of
HSV-2 infection during the same time period. We estimate
that the cumulative economic consequences of such an
increase would be substantial.
In our base case simulation, the prevalence of HSV-2
infection reached a plateau during the second half of the
21st century. Our projections of equilibrium prevalence in
the population aged 15 to 39 years as a whole are similar to
current estimates of HSV-2 prevalence among blacks,
which did not change substantially between 1978 and
1991.3,4 Our model suggests that one possible explanation
for this difference would be that the HSV-2 epidemic is
more mature and nearer to equilibrium in the African Amer-
ican population.
Our initial estimates of HSV-2 transmission rates, using
data from NHANES-II and NHANES-III, reproduced the
change in prevalence that was reported between the late
1970s and early 1990s. Our estimates of the number of
incident cases of HSV-2 infection during that time are
similar to those generated by Armstrong and colleagues,
using the same data but a different statistical model.60 For
example, Armstrong and colleagues estimated approxi-
mately 1.34 million new infections with HSV-2 among
individuals less than 39 years of age in 1985, as compared
with 1.48 million new infections projected by our model.
Our projection of HSV-2 prevalence in the late 1990s is
higher than that reported during the first year of the
NHANES-IV study, in 1999.62 This may be related to the
fact that sexual behavior remained constant in our model,
whereas sexual behaviors that would affect HSV-2 trans-
mission (particularly numbers of sex partners and rates of
condom use) may have changed in the 1990s, perhaps as a
result of the AIDS epidemic.63­65 Increased use of antiviral
drugs or cyclic variation in sexual risk behavior, as has been
seen with the US AIDS epidemic66­68 and previously with
the syphilis epidemic,69,70 might explain the discrepancy
between our model outputs and these data. Alternatively,
this discrepancy may reflect the preliminary nature of the
NHANES-IV data or the regional nature of annual sampling
in the NHANES studies. Future updates on NHANES-IV
will permit ongoing calibration of our model.
Maternal-fetal transmission of HSV-2 infection is
thought to occur with high frequency when maternal infec-
tion occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy and with
much lower frequency with chronic maternal infec-
tion.11,12,33,48,59 We initially restricted maternal­fetal trans-
mission to women with third-trimester infection; even so,
our base case analysis projected rates of neonatal HSV-2
infection higher than those reported in the population.46,59
When we added the possibility of transmission by chroni-
cally infected women, the difference between our projec-
tions and empirical estimates grew even larger. Other au-
thors have also noted that mathematical estimates of
neonatal HSV-2 are larger than empirically reported
rates.34,46,61 An important attribute of models such as this
one is their ability to highlight discrepancies such as this
one. This suggests that the epidemiology of neonatal herpes
virus infection is incompletely understood and highlights
the importance of this area for future research.
We purposefully chose to focus on the costs of incident
disease, rather than combine costs of incident and prevalent
HSV-2 infection, and we valued the total expected future
stream of costs generated by an incident infection as a cost
incurred at the time of infection. Given that goals for HSV-2
control focus on prevention of incident infections, empha-
sizing the cost of incident disease highlights modifiable
costs of the HSV-2 epidemic and makes our model poten-
tially useful for assessing the cost-effectiveness of herpes
control interventions. Because the costs associated with
genital herpes are "front-loaded," (i.e., severe medical se-
quelae, including neonatal infections, are most likely to
occur with initial infection)11,12,71 and the frequency of
relapse decreases with time,32 the impact of this assumption
is blunted.
Our annual direct medical cost estimates are higher than
some existing estimates, which have ranged from $100
million (early 1980s) to $207 million (between 1992 and
1994).38,72,73 Szucs and colleagues recently estimated total
costs of genital herpes 1996 (including patients' time and
lost wages) at $1.2 billion.74 However, although we may
have overestimated the amount of medical care required by
HSV-2-infected individuals, we have certainly underesti-
mated some costs associated with HSV-2 infection, such as
costs associated with enhanced HIV transmission among
individuals with genital herpes75­77 and economic costs
associated with the physical pain, depression, disruption of
interpersonal relationships,13,78,79 and even legal action80,81
that may accompany HSV-2 infection.
In addition, other published estimates, particularly those
derived from large databases, may be underestimates. For
example, Tao and colleagues38 estimated that only 13% to
28% of acyclovir claims not associated with a specific
diagnostic code were for the treatment of genital herpes. As
drugs accounted for over half the costs attributed to genital
herpes, underestimation of drug costs would substantially
decrease the estimated annual cost of genital herpes. When
we removed drug costs associated with chronic suppressive
antiviral therapy from our model, in conjunction with our
lower-bound estimate for the probability of symptomatic
disease, our direct medical cost estimate for 1993 decreased

to $350 million, closer to the estimate of $207 million
generated by Tao and colleagues.
Our model has additional important limitations. We did
not stratify our population according to ethnicity due to the
difficulty in making assumptions about interethnic sexual
mixing.82,83 However, the higher prevalence of HSV-2 in-
fection among blacks relative to the population as a whole3,4
suggests that the burden of morbidity and economic cost
associated with incident HSV-2 infection falls dispropor-
tionately on this population.
We used a mathematical model to project the future costs
and consequences of the HSV-2 epidemic in the United
States. Given the future economic burden that is likely to be
imposed on society by the HSV-2 epidemic, substantial
investment in HSV-2 prevention strategies makes economic
sense. The recent development of inexpensive serologic
assays for the detection of asymptomatic HSV-2 infec-
tion84­86 and promising new vaccines23,24,87,88 might pro-
vide superior means of control of the HSV-2 epidemic in the
United States. Programs incorporating these new technolo-
gies are anticipated to be expensive, but in light of the large
costs that the HSV-2 epidemic is projected to impose, such
programs may prove to be cost-effective or cost-saving.
Appendix 1: Compartmental Model for Genital HSV-2
Infection
We constructed a compartmental model to simulate the
course of the HSV-2 epidemic in individuals aged 15 to 39
years in the United States. Health states in the model were
broadly characterized as infected (I) or susceptible to infec-
tion (S). Assuming random, heterosexual mixing of the
population, susceptible individuals would become infected
in proportion to the prevalence of infection among members
of the opposite sex at some time

the annual probability of sexual transmission of HSV-2
within a sexual partnership (), and the age- and gender-
specific weighted average number of partners per person in
a year (c).25
Our model incorporated three age strata: stratum 1 in-
cluded those aged 15 to 19 years, stratum 2 included those
aged 20 to 29 years, and stratum 3 included those aged 30
to 39 years. We developed a series of difference equations
to calculate the annual number of susceptible and infected
individuals in each age stratum.
Susceptible Individuals
The first, youngest age stratum comprises individuals
who have just become sexually active. Because no individ-
ual is infected with HSV-2 before initiating sexual activity,
the number of susceptible individuals in this stratum at
some time t  1 will be equal to the number of individuals
remaining in this stratum at time t (i.e., the number not lost
due to age or acquisition of infection), plus those individuals
who enter the stratum by reaching an age at which sexual
activity is initiated. The number of individuals entering the
youngest stratum by initiating sexual activity will be pro-
portional to the size of the youngest age stratum (both
infected and susceptible individuals). Individuals move out
of the youngest susceptible age stratum either by growing
older or by acquiring HSV-2 infection.
The number of individuals in the youngest age stratum at
some time t  1 will be the number of susceptible individ-
uals:

For a given rate of population growth, g, the term

For all subsequent age strata, the rate at which susceptible

Appendix 2: Estimation of Rates of Partner Change
The rate at which HSV-2 is transmitted between men and

alence of infection among members of the opposite sex:

where pt1
is the prevalence of infection in the ith age group
at some time t1
, while pt0
is the prevalence in the ith age
group at some earlier time t0
, and t is equal to the time
elapsed between t1
and t0
. For a given age cohort, we
estimated pt1
as prevalence in that age cohort at the time of
NHANES-III, while pt0
was estimated as the prevalence in
the next youngest age cohort at the time of NHANES-II. We
estimated t as 13 years, the time elapsed between the
midpoint of NHANES-II (1978) and NHANES-III (1991).
Given equations (2.1) and (2.2), and assuming some
average seroprevalence in the opposite sex between t0
and
t1
, the product of the infectiousness of an individual with
HSV-2 and the rate of partner change in a given age cohort,

We attempted to derive rates of partner change using
other sexual mixing assumptions, including complete age-
assortative mixing (i.e., individuals choose partners from
within only their own age group),25 and using several less
extreme forms of age-assortative mixing (e.g., men mix
with women from their own and younger age groups at one
rate and with older women at another rate, while women
behave in the opposite manner). The use of age-assortative
mixing resulted in extremely high estimates of HSV-2 se-
roprevalence in the early 1990s. The use of a matrix alge-
braic approach96 demonstrated that other mixing patterns
were mathematically implausible.
Appendix 3: Projection of Future Number of Relapses
and Relapse-Associated Costs
We calculated weighted average relapse rates in the year
after infection from published distributions of symptom
frequency. Suppose n different frequencies of symptomatic
relapse are observed in a population in the first year after
development of symptomatic genital herpes. The weighted
average rate of relapse in the first year may be represented
as

(3.1)
where Lq
is the rate of relapse in the qth stratum, while Pq

frequency of relapse in individuals with symptomatic gen-
ital HSV-2 infection appears to decrease in a linear fashion
over time.10 If the annual change in the number of relapses
for a given individual is L, that individual will cease to

Appendix 4: Incidence and Costs of Maternal­Fetal
Transmission Among Women With Third-Trimester
HSV-2 Infection
Transmission of HSV-2 infection from a pregnant woman
to a neonate occurs most commonly in the context of new
maternal infection in the third trimester of pregnancy, with
delivery occurring before the development of humoral im-
munity to HSV-2 in the mother.12 Transmission of HSV-2
infection to the neonates of women with chronic HSV-2
infection appears to be much less efficient.11 In our base
case analysis, we assumed that maternal­fetal transmission
of HSV-2 occurred exclusively in the context of third-
trimester infection.
In a woman with incident HSV-2 infection, the probabil-
ity of transmission of HSV-2 to a neonate will be a function
of the probability that the woman is in the third trimester at
the time of initial infection. The expected fraction of a year
during which a woman will be in the third trimester of
pregnancy will be approximately
PLBi
4
(4.1)
where
PLBi
is the live birth rate in a woman in the ith age stratum. The
"force of infection" among initially susceptible women in
the third trimester, 
third
, will be related to the prevalence of
infection in the opposite sex, as in equation (2.1) above.
However, it might be expected that the rate of partner
change and the type of sexual activities engaged in during
the third trimester of pregnancy would be different from
those in the nonpregnant population, such that

618 Sexually Transmitted Diseases  October 2002
FISMAN ET AL
such that the model output matched empirical data on the
incidence of neonatal herpes infection.59 Between 1978 and
1981, the incidence of neonatal herpes infection in King
County, Washington, was reported to be 11.9 cases per
100,000 live births. Approximately 78% of cases of neona-
tal herpes infection were due to HSV-2 infection; thus, the
incidence of neonatal HSV-2 infection was estimated to be
9.3 per 100,000 live births.
On the basis of the estimates of incident HSV-2 infection
provided by our model and using age-specific live birth
rates, we estimated the number of third-trimester HSV-2
infections occurring in 1981 among women aged 15 to 39
years to be 8670k. If the probability of maternal­fetal trans-
mission following third-trimester infection is assumed to be
approximately 10%, the number of infants with congenital
HSV-2 infection as a result of third-trimester infection
would be 867k. We estimated a total of 3,601,270 live births
in the United States in 1981, so that the incidence of
neonatal HSV-2 infection due to third-trimester infection in
the mother would be 22.5k cases per 100,000 live births.
Assuming that King County, Washington, was representa-
tive of the United States as a whole:
22.5k
105

9.3

so that k has a value of 0.41. We assumed that changes in
sexual behavior associated with the third trimester of preg-
nancy remained constant over time and used k to estimate
the projected future number of cases of neonatal HSV-2
infection resulting from third-trimester maternal infection.
Appendix 5: The Incidence and Costs of Obstetrical
Complications of Chronic HSV-2 Infection
In our base-case analysis, we assumed that all maternal-
fetal transmission of HSV-2 would result from third-trimes-
ter maternal infection. However, there is likely a small risk
of maternal­fetal transmission of HSV-2 even for women
with chronic HSV-2 infection. In addition, women with a
history of chronic HSV-2 infection appear to be more likely
to undergo cesarean section, in part because of existing
recommendations that cesarean section be performed if vis-
ible genital lesions are present in the mother at the time of
delivery, although practicing obstetricians may be more
likely to perform cesarean sections on women with a history
of symptomatic HSV-2 even in the absence of visible le-
sions at the time of labor.51,52
The cumulative future risks of cesarean section and of
maternal­fetal transmission of HSV-2 as a result of chronic
maternal infection will be a function of the age at which
initial HSV-2 infection is acquired, as individuals who are
infected at a younger age will have, on average, more future
term pregnancies and thus more future chances to incur
obstetrical complications of chronic HSV-2 infection.
If a woman in the ith age stratum becomes infected, on
average, in the middle of that age stratum, she will have z
future years of potential child-bearing, such that:
z 
Di

· · ·Dn
(5.1)
where D is the duration of a given age stratum and n is the
total number of age strata during which childbearing is

woman would not be at risk for obstetrical complications of
chronic HSV-2 infection until the year after acute infection.
For a woman infected at some time t  0, the average
number of future pregnancies that might be complicated by
chronic HSV-2 infection would be
