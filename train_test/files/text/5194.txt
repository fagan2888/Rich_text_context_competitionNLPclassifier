internal border areas of the

that matters

Abstract
Internal borders are a major but understudied site of crimmigration as most scholarship has
focused on external borders (Van der Woude and Van Berlo, 2015). Internal borders were
supposed to disappear under the principle of free movement within the European Union. But
today we see EU member states policing the borders inside Schengen, checking identification,
verifying passage, and regulating mobility in so-called `gray zones'. This article investigates this
type of policing within the EU, focusing on the case of the Netherlands. It argues that the
policing of internal borders is highly dependent upon discretionary power, a significant factor
in the crimmigration process that we do not know enough about. Following Hawkins (1992,
2003), Schneider (1992), and Bushway and Forst (2013) on discretion and discretionary decision-
making, we examine the interaction between decisions by law-makers and policy-makers that
create discretionary space for law enforcement officials on the ground, and the way in which
these street-level bureaucrats perceive the discretionary space attributed to them. By zeroing
in on the interaction between these two actors, we aim to find the discretionary decision that
matters the most in terms of explaining the crimmigration practices, offering a more holistic and
interdisciplinary approach to border control. We discuss the implications of this power and the
consequences for the European Project as such.

Introduction
Times are turbulent for the European Union (EU). Large numbers of immigrants are try-
ing to find their ways into Fortress Europe irrespective of the dangers of such an under-
taking and the insecure future ahead of them, often fleeing desperate situations in their
home countries. Against the background of an ongoing securitization of migration in
Europe (Bourbeau, 2011; Guild, 2009; Huysmans, 2006), the influx of immigrants enter-
ing the European mainland has led to heated debates among politicians and policy-
makers, on both the member state level and the EU level, on how to best deal with the
matter. Solutions are sought in the militarization of the external borders, border fences,
and extensive yet also dispersed border surveillance (Aas, 2011). Much of the scholar-
ship on EU border matters seems to focus on the external border of the EU, whereas
developments affecting the formally non-existing internal borders between EU member
states remain relatively understudied. Obviously, the tragedies happening at the EU's
external borders justify attention. Yet, given what the EU stands for ­ being an area with-
out internal borders in order to stimulate the free flow of services, goods, and people ­
monitoring what is happening in internal border areas is as crucial. In response to the
recent immigration influx, several member states have asked for internal border checks
to be temporarily reinstalled, which would be a fundamental breach of the Schengen
acquis. Other states have started to explore the possibility offered by the Schengen
Borders Code to conduct highly discretionary random police checks ­for reasons of both
immigration control and/or crime control ­ in 20 kilometer internal border areas between
two member states (Van der Woude, 2015).
These police checks taking place in internal border areas are highly relevant in the
light of the process of crimmigration (Van der Woude and Van Berlo, 2015) ­ the
increased merger of crime control and immigration control (Aliverti, 2014; Chacón,
2009, 2014; Sitkin, 2014; Spena, 2014; Stumpf, 2006, 2011, 2013). Both virtually and
physically, borders are primary sites for authorities to distinguish between so-called
`bona fide travelers'and `crimmigrant others', being a bridge for the former and a barrier
to the latter (Aas, 2011, 2013; Barker, 2013; Stumpf, 2006; Van der Woude and Van
Berlo, 2015).The growing body of scholarship studying practices of crimmigration
seems to paint a rather grim picture: to a greater or a lesser extent, crimmigration seems
to be present in many national contexts, with no exception for countries in the EU
(Barker, 2012; Bosworth, 2014; Bosworth and Guild, 2008; Mitsilegas, 2015; Staring,
2013; Van der Woude et al., 2014).
Despite the different macro-level explanations that can account for the process of crim-
migration, many scholars directly or indirectly refer to the central role of discretionary
decision-making. Discretion allows law enforcement officials to make largely autono-
mous decisions ­ to exercise choice ­ on how to deal with an individual case. In cases in
which immigrants are involved this may also include the decision on whether to treat or
approach it as a criminal case or an immigration case, with far-reaching consequences
attached. When examining the literature on discretion and crimmigration, much of it
seems to focus on explaining why and how the actions of one specific actor contribute to
the practice of crimmigration: police and/or immigration officers (Motomura, 2011;
Weber, 2003), prosecutors (Eagly, 2011; Hernandez, 2013; Wadhia, 2015), judges (Reyes,
Van der Woude and Van der Leun 29
2012), etc. Although some scholars discuss the actions of several actors in their commen-
taries (Miller, 2005; Stumpf, 2015), little attention is being paid to the ways in which
discretionary decisions made by different actors might relate to, interact with, or depend
upon each other. Thereby the image might arise that the practice of crimmigration is to be
seen as an outcome of discretionary decisions made by one sole actor and that it is mostly
driven by decisions made on the enforcement level.
Central focus and scope
This article will argue that a multi-actor assessment of discretionary decision-making,
including also discretionary decisions made on the legislative and policy level (Schneider,
1992) can contribute to a better understanding of the implementation of crimmigration.
Such an understanding ­ both in terms of why it is happening, but also in terms of how
this implementation takes shape ­ is important in the light of exploring ways in which the
process and its often unjust outcomes could be subverted. This article will mostly focus
on the how by looking at actual practices of crimmigration and how discretion is used to
sort and regulate mobility through the criminalization frame. In doing so, the article will
focus upon the police checks carried out in the EU's internal border areas. The ways in
which member states give substance to these often highly discretionary police checks as
allowed under the Schengen Borders Code (SBC) can differ greatly both in terms of the
legal and policy framework as well as in terms of practical enforcement, with differences
in the implementation of crimmigration as a result.
This article will use the Netherlands ­ both an EU and a Schengen member ­ as a case
study. This is a crucial case because the Dutch government has already formalized the
Schengen-proof police checks by introducing the Mobile Security Monitor (MSM),
comprising time-limited immigration controls carried out by the Royal Netherlands
Marechaussee (RNM, in Dutch: Koninklijke Marechaussee). In border areas, Dutch
RNM officers are allowed to stop any vehicle or person to check their ID and legal status
under the Aliens Act, the central body of immigration law in the Netherlands, together
with the Aliens Decree and the 2012 Police Act. A reasonable suspicion of any criminal
activity or unauthorized entry or stay is not necessarily needed, which implies a lower
threshold for these controls compared with regular police checks. By following the dis-
cretionary decisions that govern the MSM, this article aims to shed further light on the
question of what the core and contingent discretionary decision(s) is/are behind the pro-
cess of crimmigration in the context of immigration control in the internal border areas
of the Netherlands.
This question falls within the scope of a larger research project `Crimmigration &
Discretionary Decision-making in EU Internal Border Areas'.1 We will draw from the
legal and empirical data collected as part of this project. Whereas previous publications
derived from this project have focused more on the higher-level policy and administra-
tive decision-making with regard to the Dutch immigration controls in border areas
(Dekkers et al., in press; Van der Woude and Van Berlo, 2015), this article will also
include data from focus group interviews and informal interviews and chats that were
carried out during ride-alongs reflecting the perceptions of RNM officials with regard to
the scope of their discretionary space. Although we also collected observational data
30 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
during the ride-alongs that provide insight into the practices on the ground, the actual
application of their discretionary space, this article explicitly aims to address the percep-
tion of discretion in the context of the MSM. By analyzing the discretion created on the
legislative and policy level and comparing it with the perceived discretion on the enforce-
ment level, we aim to shed light on whose decisions seem to matter most in fueling crim-
migration practices.
Conceptualizing discretion
As a result of fundamental changes in the nature of modern society, the state is called
upon to intervene in many areas of social life and the issues that have to be grappled with
are inherently complex (Beck, 1992; Giddens, 1999; Prosser, 1982; Unger, 1976). Both
the diversity and the complexity of problems that states have to deal with in modern
society require a flexible approach. In order to meet the demands that are being made on
the modern state, discretion, rather than fine-grained rules, appears to be a more adequate
mechanism for exercising power. Street-level bureaucrats, defined here as personnel of
criminal justice agencies who have regular direct contact with members of the public
(such as police officers or probation officers), are the final implementers of public policy.
Their jobs are inherently discretionary and influence people's lives (Lipsky, 2010;
Maynard-Moody and Musheno, 2003; Maynard-Moody and Portillo, 2010; Prottas,
1979).As Weber notes (2003: 250), `[w]hile high levels of discretion are often associated
with failure to meet the most basic requirements of justice (that is, that decisions should
be fair and not arbitrary) it is recognized that a certain amount of discretion can bring
positive benefits'. In other words, by enabling decision-makers to mitigate the unin-
tended outcomes of the application of rules in individual cases, discretion can contribute
to justice (Schneider, 1992). Obviously, it is precisely this flexibility with regard to
applying the rules that makes discretion susceptible to misuse and abuse, potentially
contributing to injustice, for instance by favoring certain social groups over others. This
brings us to the core concept in discretion: choice. For discretion to exist, an official must
be given power, within a broad framework, either to choose the end that is to be pursued,
or, if the end has already been determined, to choose the most appropriate means or
standard to achieve the end. How much discretion official have will depend on the nature
of their professional power and the recognition that other officials give to their ability to
choose (Mensah, 1998; Van der Leun, 2006). Having said this, it is important to realize
the important role the legislature and policy-makers play in allocating discretion. The
very heart of the discretionary process lies within legislative and policy decisions since
it involves decisions about the objectives and meaning of the law, and about how these
are to be shaped into strategies to permit their interpretation (Galligan, 1986). According
to Schneider (1992), discretion is deliberately built in to decision-making systems by
law-makers for a variety of reasons.
The dominant focus in social science studies on discretion is on street-level decisions,
but this does not do justice to the reality that they should always be seen as part of a
sequence of decisions and occurring as part of a network of relationships in the legal
system (Emerson, 1983; Emerson and Paley, 1992). Seemingly simple discretionary
decisions quite often involve a rather more complex series of decisions. The `output' for
Van der Woude and Van der Leun 31
one actor within a system often provides the `input' for another (Hawkins, 1992, 2003;
Hupe, 2013; Jewell and Glaser, 2006; Meyers and Nielsen, 2012). In trying to answer the
question of whose discretionary decisions matter most in fueling the practice of crim-
migration in the case of the Dutch MSM checks, the remainder of this article will adopt
a more systemic approach towards discretion by focusing on both the discretion built in
to the legal and policy framework of the MSM and the `enforcement discretion' as per-
ceived by RNM officials.
Such a systemic approach towards discretion gives room for the possibility ­ and
often reality ­ that effective powers to decide are frequently assumed by actors other than
the person allocated formal authority to exercise discretion and diffused among a variety
of actors who all play a part in the handling of an individual case. In doing so we will use
the simple yet functional conceptualization of discretion as put forward by Bushway and
Forst (2013).They distinguish between what they refer to as `Type A' and `Type B' dis-
cretion. Type A discretion refers to the discretion that individual actors have to make
decisions with variation given a set of rules and Type B refers to the discretion that leg-
islators and criminal justice policy-makers have to establish a set of rules. The choice by
legislators to impose sentencing guidelines is an act of Type B discretion; the legally
allowable choice by judges of sentences within the sentencing guideline ranges is an act
of Type A discretion. Type B discretion, the ability to create rules and policies, can be
used to limit and shape Type A discretion and there is often a tension between the rules
set by higher-level, administrative actors (Type B) and the discretion within those rules
that is available to lower(street)-level actors, responsible for the actual enforcement of
the rules. Most discussion in the literature deals with Type A discretion, yet, according to
Bushway and Forst (2013), both Type B discretion and the interaction between A and B
deserve more direct study in criminal justice. The same could be said for scholarship on
crimmigration.
Crimmigration and discretion
Crimmigration is often explained by referring to underlying trends such as over-criminal-
ization ­ the frequently deplored tendency of criminal law to expand into areas for which
its heavy-handed machinery seems ill suited (Sklansky, 2012), the emergence of an over-
all cultural obsession with security and potential dangerous `others' (Garland, 2001;
Simon, 2007), and the development of an enemy penology (Fekete and Webber, 2010).
Despite acknowledging the clear complexity and multitude of forces driving the process
of crimmigration, Motomura (2011) claims that the discretion to stop persons is the
strongest driver behind the process of crimmigration, since it enables racial profiling and
makes street-level officers responsible for funneling immigrants into systems dealing
with immigration crime or criminal violations. His assessment of the pivotal importance
of street-level decision-making in the process of crimmigration is widely shared among
scholars, who often link it to selectivity based on racial stereotypes (Hernandez, 2013;
Koulish, 2010; Miller, 2005; Pratt, 2010; Pratt and Thompson, 2008; Stumpf, 2006).
Although the process of racial profiling by law enforcement officials is unmistakably
connected with the process of crimmigration, it is unclear whether it can explain the
process or whether it is an outcome of it, or both. The answer to this question depends on
32 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
whether one approaches immigration control from a bottom up or a top down modus
(Lind, 2015). In line with Motomura's assessment, the bottom up modus attributes power
to the (Type A) decisions made on the street level. Yet, in their assessment of the crimi-
nalization of migration, Provine and Doty (2011) observe that policy responses to unau-
thorized immigration reinforce racialized anxieties by creating new discretionary spaces
of enforcement within which racial anxieties flourish and become institutionalized. In
other words, although they do acknowledge the impact of racial anxiety on the enforce-
ment level, potentially leading to racial profiling, they rather see this as the outcome of
top down (Type B) policy-level decisions.
According to Sklansky (2012), practices of crimmigration cannot be seen apart from
the more general tendency towards ad hoc instrumentalism that is visible within both
criminal and administrative law. He defines ad hoc instrumentalism as `a manner of
thinking about law and legal institutions that downplays concerns about consistency and
places little stock in formal legal categories, but instead sees legal rules and legal proce-
dures simply as a set of interchangeable tools. In any given situation, faced with any
given problem, officials are encouraged to use whichever tools are most effective against
the person or persons causing the problem'(Sklansky, 2012: 161). The underlying ration-
ale behind practices of crimmigration seems to fit in with this tendency. In order to iden-
tify dangerous individuals ­ immigrants and criminals both fitting this category ­ a
hybrid web of social control is spun in such a way that street-level law enforcement
officials can choose between their criminal and administrative (immigration law) pow-
ers. Whichever route they take ­ crime control or migration control ­ doesn't really mat-
ter, as long as their actions are effective (Chacón, 2012; Miller, 2005; Stumpf, 2006; Van
der Woude et al., 2014). Although Sklansky also attributes an important role to street-
level decisions in driving practices of crimmigration, in line with Provine and Doty
(2011), he explicitly places street-level actions in the dynamics of broader changes in the
governance of crime and migration and therewith of (Type B) decisions made in higher
legislative and policy echelons.
It seems safe to say that, although there is consensus in the literature that crimmigra-
tion and discretion are somehow related, there are different views as to whether it is more
a top down or a bottom up connection, or possibly both. We take these differing views on
what is driving crimmigration practices as a theoretical angle to study discretion in inter-
nal border control in Dutch border areas empirically at different levels.
Methodology
The present study uses a mixed methods research design, combining a policy discourse
analysis, informal interviews (held during ride-alongs with the border police), and semi-
structured focus group interviews. A key feature of mixed methods research is its meth-
odological pluralism, which offers the advantage of incorporating the strengths of
different methodological strategies. Data were collected between October 2013 and
March 2015.
First a discourse analysis was conducted on the basis of the Dutch parliamentary
debate as laid down in policy documents accessed through all relevant digital data-
bases. Using key words, a total of 451 documents were found in the databases, of
Van der Woude and Van der Leun 33
which 259 documents contained relevant information and were used in the analysis.
With regard to the upper echelons of the assumed chain of discretionary decision-
making in matters of immigration checks in border areas ­ the level of the EU, the
national legislature, and policy-makers ­ we will draw from the results of this analysis,
which were supplemented with the outcomes of a legal analysis of (supra)national
legislation and jurisprudence (Dekkers et al., in press; Van der Woude and Van Berlo,
2015; Van der Woude et al., 2015).
Secondly, in order to study street-level perceptions of discretionary decision-making,
primary data were collected through informal conversations with border police officers
carried out during ride-alongs (Geertz, 1973; Reiss, 1971). During a period of 16 months,
three researchers went on 57 ride-alongs with border patrol officers who were exercising
their discretionary powers in the context of the Mobile Security Monitor, during which
they were able to observe and talk about the MSM checks, the use and scope of discre-
tionary powers, and the work of the border patrol in general. These ride-alongs were
carried out at the seven RNM brigades that are responsible for carrying out the MSM in
the border area with Belgium and Germany. All brigades were visited at least six times
for ride-along sessions, with extra ride-alongs carried out at the larger brigades.Although
some RNM officials did show some slight distrust when the researchers went on their
first ride-along with them, a thorough explanation of the scope of the research, with an
emphasis on the fact that the researchers were independent and not hired by the RNM to
check on the street-level RNM officials, would often result in a relaxed atmosphere in
which the RNM officials were more than willing to share their views. This feeling of
trust was only further enhanced by the fact that the researchers returned to a brigade
multiple times. This, combined with the informal nature of the conversations and the
familiar setting, decreased the chance of politically correct answers (Finch et al., 2013;
Krueger, 1994; Krueger and Casey, 2009). In the present article we do not use the obser-
vation data, but we do draw from the informal interviews.
Thirdly, focus group interviews were conducted to gather more in-depth information
on specific subjects related to discretion and street-level decision-making in the context
of the MSM. Focus group interviews are useful for exploring and examining what people
think, how they think, and why they think the way they do about the issues of importance
to them without pressuring them into making decisions or reaching a consensus. Focus
groups permit researchers to search for the reasons why particular views are held by
individuals and groups. The method also provides insight into the similarities and differ-
ences of understandings held by people (Krueger, 1994; Krueger and Casey, 2009; Finch
et al., 2013). A total of 13 focus groups with 6­10 participants were organized divided
over all seven brigades, resulting in 25 hours of conversation. All focus groups consisted
of a mixture of experienced and less experienced border patrol officers who were all car-
rying out MSM checks as part of their duties. During most focus groups, all RNM offi-
cials who were present participated in the discussion, some more actively than others,
which is one of the most important limitations of focus group interviews (Krueger and
Casey, 2009). Yet, knowing this pitfall, the moderator directly intervened in such
instances. Being a military organization, it was mostly the younger and often less expe-
rienced or less highly ranked officials who kept somewhat of a low profile. Again, when
noticed by the moderator, these officials would be explicitly asked to respond.
34 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
The discourse analysis resulted in 259 documents selected to be analyzed. Valuable
information from the ride-alongs and the informal conversations were recorded in the
researcher's field notes. After the shifts, these field notes were written down in a
detailed and structured manner in order to be coded. The focus group interviews were
audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and also coded. All data were analyzed with soft-
ware for qualitative analysis Atlas-Ti. As mentioned above, the observations will be
reported on elsewhere. Access for this unique long-term and intensive research pro-
ject was obtained after a series of meetings taking place over the course of two years
during which the project coordinator reached an agreement with the RNM and the
Ministry of Security and Justice. The agreement was formalized by a written covenant
in which the independent position of the researchers and privacy issues were dealt
with. As part of the covenant, an external advisory board of academic experts and
officials working for the Ministry of Security and Justice and the Ministry of Defence
was established.
Discretionary decisions and the implementation of
crimmigration
Based on secondary research of the legal and policy context of immigration and border
control as well as on primary empirical research with regard to the way in which Dutch
border patrol officers perceive their task and their discretionary space, this section aims
to shed further light on the way in which the various levels of discretionary decision-
making relate to each other at both the national and the European (the supranational)
level. At both levels, Type B discretionary decisions can be made. By leaving room for
member states to decide how to interpret or how to implement certain EU rules or direc-
tives, discretionary space is created on the supranational level. Yet member states also
make Type B discretionary decisions by translating political and policy goals into the
rules and regulations that in turn govern street-level officials. The first two subsections
are based on the outcomes of the analysis of legal and policy documents, and subsection
3 draws from the data collected through the focus group interviews.
Creating discretionary space on the European level
When researching immigration controls carried out in the border areas between EU
member states, the point of departure for exploring discretionary decisions that might
have contributed to the process of crimmigration is obviously the 1985 Schengen
Agreement. This agreement proposed the gradual abolition of border checks at the sig-
natories' common borders. In addition, the agreement included sections dealing with
the harmonization of visa and asylum policies, the common fight against drug-related
crime, and increased controls at the EU's external borders. The rules that govern the
movement of persons across the Schengen borders can be found in the Schengen
Borders Code (SBC) as adopted in 2006. The SBC sets out the standards and procedures
to be followed in controlling the movement of persons across internal and external
Schengen borders and should thus offer clear guidelines for border patrol agents on how
to perform their duties.
Van der Woude and Van der Leun 35
According to Article 22 SBC, `[i]nternal borders may be crossed at any point without
a border check on persons, irrespective of their nationality, being carried out'.According
to the travaux préparatoires, this provision means that any control, whether systematic
or by spot-checks, carried out solely for the reason of crossing an internal border, is
incompatible with the idea of a single area without borders, and is therefore prohibited.2
Nevertheless, Article 23(a) SBC makes clear that lifting border controls does not mean
giving up all forms of control in border areas: `The abolition of border control at inter-
nal borders shall not affect the exercise of police powers by the competent authorities of
the Member States under national law, insofar as the exercise of those powers does not
have an effect equivalent to border checks.' Border checks, according to Article 2(10)
SBC, are `checks carried out at border crossing points, to ensure that persons, including
their means of transport and the objects in their possession, may be authorized to enter
the territory of the Member States or authorized to leave it'. Following this definition,
police checks are not allowed at the actual internal border between two member states
but they can be carried out in the area around the border. As Article 23(a iii) SBC further
states, the aim of the police checks will `in particular' be to combat cross-border crime.
Looking at the SBC, it seems safe to say that it creates discretionary space for member
states to autonomously decide how they want to carry out police checks, where, for how
long, and with what aim. This might be considered as problematic, or at least remarka-
ble, given the `freedom of movement' and the lifting of formal border control as one of
the key features of the European Project. These ambiguities in the SBC demonstrate that
much of the actual implementation of these police checks has been left to the discretion
of member states.
The problematic nature of the vagueness of Article 23 SBC was affirmed by two
important cases that were brought before the Court of Justice for the EU (CJEU). In the
cases Melki & Abdeli3 (CJEU: 22 June 2010, CJEU C188/10 and C189/10) and Adil4
(CJEU: 19 July 2012, C278/12 PPU) the legitimacy of the national legal framework
governing police checks carried out in France (Melki & Abdeli) and in the Netherlands
(Adil) was contested in the light of the right to free movement as represented by Articles
22 and 23 SBC. In both cases the Court ruled that, in order to comply with Articles 22
and 23(a) of the SBC, national legislation granting a power to police authorities to carry
out identity checks must provide the necessary framework for the power granted to those
authorities in order, inter alia, to guide the discretion that those authorities enjoy in the
practical application of that power. In order to guarantee that that the practical exercise
of that power, consisting in carrying out identity controls, would not have an effect
equivalent to border checks, the national framework should contain detailed rules and
limitations in order to define the intensity, frequency, and selectivity of the checks. A
further explanation or guideline as to how detailed the national legal framework should
be on these three matters, or how these three rather general concepts should be inter-
preted in the light of open borders, was not given by the CJEU or by the European
Commission in response to the two rulings.
In sum, guidance with regard to the way in which member states legally formalize
let alone practically shape the Schengen-proof police checks is limited. This can be seen
as an example of what Schneider (1992) refers to as rule-compromise discretion: discre-
tion intentionally built in to the decision-making systems of member states as a result of
36 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
general EU norms. This allows member states to shape their national legislation in such
a way that it can do justice to the specific demographic, institutional, legal, etc. charac-
teristics. The responsibility to meet the requirements of the SBC is intentionally passed
to the national legislator since it would be impossible for the supranational rule-makers
to come up with an all-encompassing legal framework that would fit all member states.
Creating discretionary space on the national level
The Dutch government was one of the first to sign and implement the Schengen
Agreement, yet it was also one of the first to introduce a form of police control in the
border areas. The easing of internal borders under the Schengen Agreement had the par-
liament worried, leading to the implementation of the Mobile Aliens Monitor (MAM).5
The original goal of the Monitor, as stated in a 1994 letter by the State Secretary, was `to
prevent illegal entry and irregular stay of aliens'.6 The Monitor was seen as an important
tool to stop unwanted immigrants at the border and to discourage prospective immigrants
from coming to the Netherlands without legal authorization. The chosen aim is interest-
ing in the light of the parameters set by the SBC. As mentioned in the previous section,
the SBC (Article 23[a iii]) explicitly states that police checks in border areas are particu-
larly meant to combat cross-border crime. Controlling immigration or immigration-
related crime is not mentioned at all.
Over the course of the years it became clear that RNM officers also ran into certain
forms of cross-border crimes while performing the MAM, human smuggling and iden-
tity fraud being the two most important. These crimes did not formally fall under the
scope of Monitor because it was ­ and still is ­ predominantly meant as an instrument of
immigration control, legally founded in the Dutch Aliens Act and the Aliens Decree.
When encountering a case of human smuggling or identity fraud ­ phenomena falling
under the scope of the criminal law ­ RNM officers immediately had to delegate these
cases to the national police since they themselves were unauthorized to deal further with
the case. Since this course of events was seen as inefficient and frustrating, the Dutch
legislature in 2006 decided to formally expand the powers of the border patrol while
exercising the MAM by amending the Dutch Police Act. From that year on, RNM offi-
cials were legally allowed not only to use their discretionary powers for the purposes of
immigration control, but also to check for the allegedly immigration-related crimes of
human smuggling and identity fraud.7
The expansion in the scope of the MAM seemed to bring it more in line with the lan-
guage of Article 23 SBC, which clearly speaks of police checks carried out to combat
cross-border crime. From a crimmigration perspective, the expansion can be seen as
problematic because it attributes powers of both crime control and immigration control
to one actor: the RNM official having to enforce the MSM. Although the legislature
seems to have put a clear limitation on the discretionary powers of the RNM officials by
limiting their crime control powers strictly to cases of human smuggling and identity
fraud, no accountability structure was put in place to ensure that RNM officials in the
field would also interpret and apply their newly acquired tasks this restrictively.
This missing accountability structure seems particularly concerning in the light of a
shift in the political discourse on border security in the Netherlands. Starting in 2010,
Van der Woude and Van der Leun 37
official policy documents all of sudden spoke of the Mobile Security Monitor instead of
the Mobile Aliens Monitor without there being any changes in the formal discretionary
powers of RNM officials, as seemed to be suggested by this new name.8 The reason for
the name change was addressed in a letter from the Minister for Immigration, Integration
and Asylum.9 The minister explained that, during the MSM checks, criminal offenses
were often encountered that made these checks an important tool not just for immigration
purposes but also for combating crime. The fact that the latter was still legally limited to
crimes of human smuggling and identity fraud was conveniently left out. Although the
name change was presented as merely cosmetic, in the light of finding decisions that
might have influenced the practice of crimmigration enforcement and the perceptions of
RNM officials in the field, it seems very significant.
Contrary to the formal expansion suggested by the name change, the use of the MSM
was legally restricted in 2011, this time by a formal change of the Dutch Aliens Decree
(Article 4.17a) in response to the ruling of the CJEU in the previously mentioned Melki
& Abdeli case.10 Whereas, prior to the ruling, the MSM was not restricted in terms of
time and location, the restrictions limited the MSM checks on the road to a maximum of
6 hours a day and 90 hours a month. Whereas the obligation to define the intensity and
frequency of the MSM checks in the national legislative framework has been rather
explicitly met by the Dutch legislature by setting clear numerical limits, this cannot be
said for the third aspect mentioned in the Melki & Abdeli ruling: the decision to select a
person or a vehicle for a check. Although the CJEU asked for `detailed rules and limita-
tions defining the selectivity of the checks', Article 4.17a of the Dutch Aliens Decree
merely states that `only a part of the passing vehicles will be stopped'. By not addressing
specific criteria for selection, the decision to select a vehicle for an MSM check is com-
pletely left to the discretion of the RNM official in the field, making this decision of the
Dutch legislature a good example of rule-binding discretion deliberately built in to the
decision-making system (Schneider, 1992). This type of discretion recognizes the value
of practical experience and knowledge of street-level decision-makers in deciding,
within the framework of the law, how to respond in a certain situation. In our case this
means that a high level of trust is attributed to the professional intuition and experience
of RNM officials in selecting cars for an MSM check.
In line with the observations on the supranational legal framework, can the national
legal framework regulating the MSM also be characterized as highly discretionary, espe-
cially with regard to the key question of how the selection for the MSM checks is made
by individual RNM officials? This question is important not just because of heated pub-
lic and academic discussions on ethnic ­ or racial ­ profiling by law enforcement offi-
cials in general, but also because of the seemingly ambiguous scope of the Monitor as a
result of the name change, combined with the partial expansion towards also becoming
an instrument of crime control. To what extent did these changes affect the way RNM
officials perceive the MSM and their discretionary power?
Street-level perceptions of discretionary decision-making in border areas
The previous two subsections have dealt with decisions taken on the legislative and
policy level that create discretion for street-level RNM officials. By drawing from the
38 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
data collected during the focus group interviews, this subsection will address the percep-
tions of RNM officials of their discretionary powers under the MSM. Two of the core
questions of the focus group interviews ­ `What is the aim of the MSM?' and `What do
you see as your most important task?' ­ often resulted in very lively discussions and
important insights into the way in which RNM officers perceived their discretionary
power.
Although the majority of the respondents mentioned that the MSM was meant as an
instrument of immigration control, and therefore combating unauthorized stay (com-
monly referred to as illegal stay) was the main reason to perform these checks, a large
part of these respondents also added that, `besides combating illegal stay, the MSM is
also meant to combat cross-border crime'. When asked to specify cross-border crime, it
was interesting to hear that a fair number of the respondents also included crimes such as
drug trafficking, money laundering, and gun offenses.
`The police is responsible for the security in the streets, the RNM is responsible for the safety
and security of the state. That also includes catching folks who are dangerous due to carrying
weapons or drugs across the border.'
As mentioned previously, RNM officials have the authority to actively look for cross-
border crimes during the MSM. Nevertheless, this authority is limited only to human
smuggling and identity fraud as `migration-related' forms of cross-border crime. When
this legal limitation was mentioned by the moderator, respondents would often start
questioning whether this limitation was legitimate and effective in their eyes. These dis-
cussions would in the end always come back to the 2010 name change from Mobile
Aliens Monitor to Mobile Security Monitor.
`In the early 90s it was clear that we could only use the powers attributed to us by the Aliens
Act, but the goal at the time was to combat illegal immigration. Over time, society has changed,
crime has changed and they changed the name into Mobile Security Monitor and much more
priority was given to catching criminal illegal immigrants.'
During every focus group, respondents mentioned that the name change resulted in some
confusion at the street level. Although the majority of the respondents were very aware
of the fact that the name change had not formally resulted in an expansion of their dis-
cretionary powers, a small portion of the respondents was not. They were under the
impression that the MSM could be used as a fully fledged instrument of crime control
after the name change and that it was no longer restricted to human smuggling and iden-
tity fraud.
`In the 20 kilometer zone around the border you're no longer specifically focusing on illegal
immigration, you're also focusing on safety and security ... which means that you also pay
attention to money laundering and stuff like that.'
Interestingly enough, all the respondents thought it necessary to indeed expand the
legal framework of the MSM to all forms of cross-border crime, since that would be
more in line with their daily practices and with the image of the MSM as presented to the
Van der Woude and Van der Leun 39
general public. Many respondents expressed feelings of frustration with regard to the
current state of their powers. These frustrations were often motivated by addressing the
fact that, `in the end, we're the frontline of defense for the Netherlands' or by the fact
that, `whereas the national police is for defending the streets, we're here to defend the
nation-state, that's quite different'. Two respondents aptly capture the broadly shared
feelings of frustration and incomprehension:
`When you are checking a car and immigration-wise everything is fine, they have the right
papers etc., that obviously doesn't mean that they cannot have someone or something illegal
lying in the trunk. Officially, your hands are tied because their IDs and paperwork were fine.
Under these circumstances, the Aliens Act forces you to let them go. But the thing is, you are
standing there to secure the safety of the Netherlands. With that in mind, it is strange that you
are legally restricted from fully checking a car.'
`We're located in these border areas and the name is Mobile Security Monitor. We're the first
ones to guarantee the security of the Netherlands, that's the focus of our organization. And if
that's your target, to monitor the security in the Netherlands while also saying that I cannot use
my powers to combat crime because that's not why I am here... Well, hello, I need to know who
is entering my country? I need to create a secure situation, which is my task isn't it?'
The frustration about the ambiguous aim of the MSM also contributed to the notewor-
thy situation of RNM officials actively exploring the boundaries of the legal framework.
As many respondents stated, although the name change had not resulted in an expansion
of the legal framework, it seemed to imply that this was something to which the RNM as
an organization aspired. Therefore, many respondents admitted that this provoked `being
creative' with their powers. `Being creative' referred to situations in which RNM offi-
cials intentionally overstepped the discretionary powers attributed to them under the
Aliens Act by using them ­ or abusing them ­ for reasons of crime control. Several RNM
officials ­ also including some higher ranked officers ­ expressed the necessity of seek-
ing out the limits of the law in order to create case law that could eventually lead to more
clarity about the implications of the name change for street-level decision-making. This
situation, where there seems to be a push from the street level to the policy level to make
legal potentially illegal practices that are part of the system (Davis, 1971), is characteris-
tic of rule-binding discretion. And, as we established in the previous subsection, the
discretionary space created by the Dutch legislature allowing RNM officials to rather
autonomously decide which cars to stop and check can be characterized as such.
From a crimmigration perspective it is important to note the ease with which immi-
gration and crime were being lumped together in the focus group interviews, even by
those respondents who were well aware of the fact that the MSM was formally predomi-
nantly meant to combat unauthorized stay in the Netherlands. These discussions were
often related to the alleged `proven' links between illegal border crossings and cross-
border crime (`if you have nothing to hide, there's no need for false paperwork') or
alleged connections between migration and terrorism. According to the large majority of
the respondents, the presence of the RNM in the border areas was of great importance in
current times of mass migration and terrorism. With some exceptions, the dominant dis-
course around the MSM was clearly a discourse of safety and security in which
40 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
immigration was seen as a factor potentially threatening security. As Van der Woude
et al. (2014) note, besides actual laws and policies, an important marker of the process of
crimmigration is the way in which issues relating to crime and immigration are perceived
and framed on the social and the policy level, but in terms of explaining crimmigration
practices.
Crimmigration checks in the EU's internal border areas?
This article has sought to shed light on the influence of discretionary decisions on the
process of crimmigration, by distinguishing between discretionary decisions taken on
various levels and by different actors. The often heard claim or assumption that street-
level officials are the most important drivers in the crimmigration process has not been
empirically verified in the case of the Netherlands. Our study suggests that the culprits in
the merger of crime control and migration control are to be found in the upper echelons
of criminal justice decision-making. Based on the outcomes of this study, Type B deci-
sions made at both the European and the national level seem to play a more important
role in the process of crimmigration than Type A ­ street-level ­ decisions by RNM
officials. By leaving much room for interpretation of the legal framework ­ both for
member states on how to translate the Schengen Borders Code into their national legisla-
tion and for RNM officials on how to interpret the national legal framework of the MSM
­ favorable conditions are created for crimmigration practices. This is especially the case
since Dutch RNM officials are by law equipped with both immigration control and spe-
cific crime control powers while enforcing the MSM.
Although the use of their crime control powers is formally limited to specific situa-
tions, the joint political and organizational ­ Type B ­ decision to change the name of
the Monitor has suggested a broader application. As the empirical research has shown,
this leads to confusion and sometimes frustration at the street level. RNM officials
increasingly seem to focus on crime control while they are performing the MSM and
they feel legitimized to do so by the name change, which also seems to have fueled
existing perceptions of the links between crime and migration. They also perceive a
large amount of discretionary space while enforcing the RNM in a crime- and immigra-
tion-oriented manner.
At the same time, it should be realized that there can be a gap between what people
say ­ during interviews ­ and what people do in practice. In order to truly grasp the way
in which RNM officials enforce their discretionary powers and how this might contrib-
ute to the practice of crimmigration, it is necessary to observe their decision-making
processes over a long period of time, which is another part of our study that is not
reported on here. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that the implicit or explicit claim
that street-level officials are the most important drivers in crimmigration needs to be
nuanced. Owing to the formulation of open norms on the supranational and national
levels, discretionary space is consciously introduced into the decision-making scheme
governing the MSM. Time limitations do not fundamentally limit this space. Although
the discretionary decisions most visibly reflecting crimmigration practices might be
taken on the street level, the foundation for these decisions was laid on higher legisla-
tive and policy levels.
Van der Woude and Van der Leun 41
In order to more thoroughly unravel the process of crimmigration, an interdisciplinary
holistic multi-level approach is thus necessary. Focusing on one actor and ignoring the
social and political context within which crimmigration decisions are made will by defi-
nition lead to an incomplete analysis of the process of crimmigration and its drivers.
Nevertheless, there are always additional questions to explore. As mentioned in previ-
ously, the national legislature has created discretionary space for RNM officials to select
which cars to stop for an MSM check. In the context of further disentangling the process
of crimmigration, it is precisely this decision that needs further scrutiny. It would be
relevant to investigate to what extent border police officers see parallels between the
people they would stop from an immigration point of view and those they would stop
from a criminal law point of view. In other words, to what extent are some immigrant
groups in practice also associated with certain forms of cross-border crime? Another
open question concerns the effectiveness of these strategies when it comes to crime con-
trol. What is the added value of border area policing in combating migration crimes? The
latter question requires a quantitative and potentially semi-experimental research design,
which was not feasible in the context of the existing study.
The outcomes of the present study have implications for the European Project. One
could argue that the mere possibility of performing immigration checks in border areas
is already questionable from the perspective of free movement, which can be seen as the
core characteristic of the EU. Surely, the frequency and intensity of these checks have
been limited as a result of the rulings of the CJEU, but member states still enjoy a great
amount of discretion on how to translate the Schengen Borders Code into their national
legislation. And since the SBC is rather vague on the exact nature of these checks, mem-
ber states can deal with them creatively. Although the European Commission announced
stricter checks on the implementation and enforcement of EU legislation on the member
state level in the 2013 Schengen Governance Package, it remains to be seen what this
actually means in practice. In the light of the present influx of immigrants through the
southern and eastern external borders of the EU and the difficult political process with
respect to more fundamental harmonization and burden-sharing with respect to asylum
seekers, it is to be expected that member states ­ especially those in Western Europe ­
will seek out all options to somehow manage or at least monitor who is entering through
the border areas of their nation states (Van der Woude and Van Berlo, 2015). Terrorist
threats and attacks, including the recent ones in France, add to the urgency that is felt in
this respect. Although the original promise of creating a borderless Europe within which
crossing a land border should be as easy as crossing a municipal border sounded good, it
has proven to be too good to be true. Countries are increasingly looking for ways to use
the gray areas of supranational and national legislation in such a way that the promise of
a borderless Europe applies only to a privileged group of bona fide travelers and not to
those who are seen as the crimmigrant `other'(Aas, 2011). Security concerns are crucial,
but the implications of the increasing merger of crime and migration control across
Europe deserve attention that goes further than solely looking at street-level decisions.

3. Mr Melki and Mr Abdeli, two Algerian nationals who were unlawfully present in France,
were subject to a French police control near the Belgian border and placed in administrative
detention. Mr Melki and Mr Abdeli challenged the lawfulness of their detention before the
juge des libertés et de la détention (judge deciding on provisional detention). Inter alia they
pleaded that the provisions of the French Code of Criminal Procedure in the context of which
such controls took place was unconstitutional.
 4. Mr Adil, an Afghan national, was stopped on 28 March 2012 by the RNM in the course of an
MSM check when traveling on a bus coming from Germany, in the area extending up to 20
kilometers from the land border of the Netherlands with Germany. By a decision of 28 March
2012, Mr Adil was placed in administrative detention. Mr Adil contested the lawfulness of his
detention on the ground that the MTV check, to which he was subject, amounted to a border
check and was, therefore, contrary to Regulation (EC) No. 562/2006 (`the Schengen Borders
Code'), concerning the crossing of the territory of the State parties to the Convention imple-
menting the Schengen Agreement (`Schengen Convention').
