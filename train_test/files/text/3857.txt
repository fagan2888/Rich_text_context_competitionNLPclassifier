Male-Taller and Male-Not-Too-Tall Norms
in Taiwan: A New Methodological Approach
Hung-Lin Tao1
Abstract
This study proposed ordered probit models as a methodology to verify the male-taller norm and the male-not-too-tall norm while
controlling for other factors. This study confirmed the prevalence of the male-taller and the male-not-too-tall norms in Taiwan.
The frequency of the height difference between a husband and wife within the range of 5­15 cm was higher than what would be
expected by chance. This range in Taiwan was smaller than the range in the United Kingdom, which may imply that there are
preferred height differences between couples that vary across populations.

Studies on desired partners have shown that an ideal partner for
a male is shorter than himself, whereas for a female, an ideal
partner is taller than herself (Buss & Barnes, 1986; Fink,
Neave, Brewer, & Pawlowski, 2007; Higgins, Zheng, Liu, &
Sun, 2002; Pierce, 1996; Salska et al., 2008; Yancey & Emer-
son, 2016). This rule has been called the ``male-taller'' norm
(Gillis & Avis, 1980), and women are more likely to comply
with the male-taller norm than men (Stulp, Buunk, & Pollet,
2013). In studies on personal advertisements, Pawlowski and
Koziel (2002) and Campos et al. (2002) found that the response
rate or hit rate for tall males was greater, but for tall females, it
was lower. In personal advertisements, females usually seek a
taller partner (Koestner & Wheller, 1988). Shepperd and
Strathman (1989) reported that females rated taller males as
being more attractive. Taller males had also dated more fre-
quently than their counterparts. In the marriage market, a
male's height is valued by females.
Male physical contests for mates are rare in modern societ-
ies. Yet, male height still matters in female mate selection. Two
possible reasons explain why modern women prefer tall men.
First, as evolutionary psychology suggests, modern female
height preferences might be inherited from our ancestors
(Judge & Cable, 2004; Murray & Schmitz, 2011). Namely, tall
males are perceived to be more attractive. Secondly, studies
have shown that male height is positively associated with edu-
cational attainment (Cinnirella, Piopiunik, & Winter, 2011;
Magnusson, Rasmussen, & Gyllensten, 2006; Meyer & Selmer,
1999; Silventionen et al., 1999; Szklarska, Koziel, Bielicki, &
Malina, 2007), income (Bo
¨ckerman & Vainioma
¨ki, 2013; Case
& Paxson, 2008; Kortt & Leigh, 2010; Lundborg, Nystedt, &
Rooth, 2014; Persico, Postlewaite, & Silverman, 2004), lead-
ership (Blaker et al., 2013; Murray & Schmitz, 2011; Stulp,
Buunk, Verhulst, & Pollet, 2013), and status (Case & Paxson,
2008; Heineck, 2005; Komlos & Kriwy, 2002; Krzy_
zanowska
& Mascie-Taylor, 2011; Silventoinen, Lahelma, Lundberg, &
Rahkonen, 2001). Specifically, for the first explanation, evolu-
tionary psychology argues that women are born with the per-
ception that tall men are more attractive than short men. The
second explanation indicates that men's height is positively
correlated with resource access.
The male-taller norm is not universally true, in particular not
in some indigenous populations that have been isolated from
modernization. On the one hand, Sear and Marlowe (2009)
found that mate selection for actual couples is random with
respect to height in the Hadza, a hunter-gatherer population
living in Tanzania. Sorokowski and Sorokowska (2012)
reached the same conclusion with regard to Yali populations,

a traditional ethnic group living in the mountains of Papua,
Indonesia. Sorokowski and Butovskaya found that both sexes
in Datoga, a tribe living in Tanzania, prefer their partners to be
either much taller or much shorter than themselves. The mate
selection in these populations violates the male-taller norm. On
the other hand, Sorokowski et al. (2015) did find the male-taller
preference in some indigenous populations, such as the Hadza
and the Tsiman´
e. The Tsiman´
e are a native Amazonian society
of farmer foragers in the area of Beni in northern Bolivia, while
the Hadza were also investigated by Sear and Marlowe (2009)
as mentioned above. Becker, Touraille, Froment, Heyer, and
Courtiol (2012) found that the male-taller norm even prevailed
in Baka pygmies in central Cameroon.
Furthermore, although the male-taller norm prevails in
Western countries, people prefer the height difference between
a husband and wife to be within a certain range (Courtiol,
Raymond, Godelle, & Ferdy, 2010; Fink et al., 2007;
Pawlowski, 2003; Salska et al., 2008; Stulp, Buunk, Pollet,
Nettle, & Verhulst, 2013; Stulp, Mills, Pollet, & Barrett,
2014; Yancey & Emerson, 2016). This preference is named the
``male-not-too-tall'' norm. Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, and
Verhulst (2013) was the first to indicate that the most frequent
range of height difference was within 25 cm in the United
Kingdom. If the two explanations aforementioned can fully
support the male-taller norm, then short women look for the
same tall men as tall women do. But this is not what we
observed. The incomplete explanation of evolutionary psychol-
ogy and resource access hypotheses on assortative mating with
respect to height implies more hypotheses are needed.
Recently, in addition to the two possible explanations for the
male-taller norm, researchers (Salska et al., 2008; Swami et al.,
2008; Yancey & Emerson, 2016) have proposed a third possi-
ble explanation, a socialization explanation, for the male-taller
norm. They argued that the male-taller norm is a reflection of
sex-role ideology or sex stereotype because height amounts to
dominance. Although the sex-role explanation can be partially
covered by the first two explanations, Yancey and Emerson
(2016) showed that height preference for a mate should not
violate societal expectation. Respondents clearly specified that
a great height difference is awkward or weird even though the
male-taller norm was met. In other words, when people look for
a mate, they prefer a male taller than his coupled female but not
too tall.
The purpose of this study was to use Taiwanese data to
verify the assortative mating with respect to height: the male-
taller and male-not-too-tall norms in Taiwan. This study con-
tributes to the literature on assortative mating with respect to
height in three ways. First, most of the existing evidence of the
assortative mating with respect to height are from Western
populations (Krzy_
zanowska, Mascie-Taylor, & Thalabard,
2015; Sear, 2010). The conclusion of this study provides evi-
dence from Eastern population. Second, the conclusions of the
assortative mating with respect to height are usually challenged
by the possibility that the observed assortative mating with
respect to height is due to characteristics other than height,
say education (Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al., 2013). This study
employed an ordered probit model to verify the male-taller and
the male-not-too-tall norm, while controlling for other charac-
terisitcs. Third, using a sample from the United Kingdom,
Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al. (2013) found that couples where
the male partner was taller than the female partner within 25 cm
occurred at a higher frequency in actual couples than that
expected by chance. If the male-not-too-tall norm does prevail
in a society, the most frequent height difference between a
couple observed might vary with societies. It would be inter-
esting to see whether the most frequent height difference
between a couple will change for Eastern population, and what
the implications are if such difference is observed.
Material and Method
Sample
The data were from the Elementary School Children's Nutri-
tion and Health Survey (ESCNHS) in Taiwan 2001­2002,
financially supported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare
and compiled by Academia Sinica in 2001 and 2002. The pur-
pose of this survey was to investigate elementary students'
nutrition and health status. This survey also asked students'
parents to report their heights. To date in Taiwan, this is a rare
data set simultaneously documenting the wife's and the hus-
band's height. The ESCNHS is unique for the purpose of this
study. In all, 3,069 students were drawn by stratified random
sampling from the whole nation, and 2,419 students and their
families completed the questionnaire. After deleting single par-
ent and observations without height, age, educational attain-
ment, and family income, 1,344 observations remained for
husband and wife samples. This is the studied sample.
The ESCNHS separatively asked a child's father and
mother their family income: ``Taking all income sources into
account, on average, how much is your monthly family
income?'' The answer is categorized to (1) less than 10,000,
(2) 10,000 ­20,000, (3) 20,000­30,000, . . . , (15) 140,000­
150,000; (16) more than 150,000 New Taiwan dollars, (17)
uncertain income, and (18) no income. The other categories
are ``don't know'' and ``refused to answer.'' The middle val-
ues from Categories (2) to (15) are used to be their family
income. The income proxy for Categories (1) and (16) are
5,000 and 155,000 New Taiwan dollars, respectively. The
amount of income is 0 for uncertain income and no income.
If only one spouse reported that the family has income, then
this reported income is used as the family income. When both
father and mother reported their family income, their average
value is taken as their family income.
Educational attainment is recorded in 21 educational cate-
gories in the questionnaire. These educational categories are
transferred into 11 categories in terms of educational years. For
example, diploma of senior high school, vocational senior high
school, and army academy senior high school all indicate
9 years of education. The questionnaire contains 7 levels of
educational attainment: no education, elementary school,
junior high school, senior high school, junior college, college,
2 Evolutionary Psychology
and postgraduate school. The 21 educational categories inclu-
defive other categories that do not finish the middle five edu-
cational levels, for example, some years in elementary school.
In these cases, respondents who reported studying for some
years in certain educational level are assumed finishing half
of the number of educational years. As some years in college
and graduates of junior college have the same number of edu-
cational years, these two categories have the same number of
educational years. Consequently, there are 11 categories in
terms of educational years. In addition to height, Table 1 pre-
sents that average family income and its standard deviation of
this data set are 62,619 and 34,099 New Taiwan dollars, respec-
tively. They are respectively about 1,957, and 1,066 U.S. dol-
lars. Husbands' and wives' average educational years are 11.7
and 11.2 years, respectively. Their respective standard devia-
tions are 2.86 and 2.71. On average, husbands are older than
their wives by about 3 years. The average ages for husbands
and wives are, respectively, 40.3 and 37.4, and their standard
deviations are 4.83 and 4.64, respectively. The average age of
their children is 8.45, and its standard deviation is 1.70 (not
shown in Table 1).
Method
Random Simulation
Given the distributions of male and female heights in this sam-
ple, this study conducted a random match of men and women.
A random simulation was repeatedly run 200 times. A random
value X was drawn and was assigned to each husband. In the
simulation, the 1,344 wives were not resorted. In all, 1,344
husbands were then resorted according to the magnitude of the
drawn random value, and a new set of random matches was
obtained. Recall that parents in this sample had children of a
similar age meaning that all males and females in this sample
can be recoupled in terms of their own ages. In other words, the
random simulation will not generate a couple where the hus-
band is aged 25 and a wife is aged 70.
Ordered Probit Model
A woman of a certain height group might be more likely to be
married to a man of a certain height group, say 5­15 cm taller
than themselves. An ordered probit model is appropriate for
this study's purpose. The dependent variable of an ordered
probit model is an ordinal and discrete variable. A continuous
height variable can be classified into several categories, as in
Table 1. An ordered probit model cannot be successfully con-
ducted when any category of the dependent variable contains a
few observations. Because only a small number of husbands
were shorter than or equal to 155 cm, the model specifies
husbands shorter than or equal to 160 cm as one category.
Similarly, wives taller than 170 cm were rare; this category
was combined with 166­170 cm. Consequently, there were
respectively five height categories for husband's height and
wife's height as each model's dependent variable. As spouse
height was the explanatory variable, it was classified into five
categories. Through this classification, the study could exam-
ine which wife height category was more likely to be matched
with which husband height category.

Results
Assortative Mating
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics by height. The two panels
display the relationships between the height of male and female
spouses, between one's height and family income, their educa-
tional years, and their ages. Table 1 demonstrates that hus-
band's height and wife's height were positively associated.
The correlation coefficient between the height of spouses is
.23 (p < .01). Table 1 also exhibits that relative height is posi-
tively correlated with husband's height (r ¼ .61; p < .01) and
negatively correlated with wife's height (r ¼ À.63; p < .01).
Husband's height is positively correlated with family income
(r ¼ .22; p < .01) and with their educational years (r ¼ .24;
p < .01). Likewise, wife's height is positively correlated with
family income (r ¼ .15; p < .01) and with their educational
years (r ¼ .14; p < .01). Simple linear regression coefficients
have similar meanings as correlation coefficients. The height
regression was conducted (not shown), and the height squared
of spouse was also included in the regression model, but both
spouse's height and its square were nonsignificant.
Although in general, taller wives had higher family incomes
and educational attainment, wives in the tallest group did not
have the highest family income and the highest eduational
attainment. Men's height was more strongly associated with
their achievement. The correlation coefficients between height
and education and between height and family income for men
were stronger than those for women, and the differences were
significant. The Fisher's Z transformation tests were 1.762 (one
way p ¼ .039) and 2.572 (p ¼ .005) for the former and the
latter, respectively.
Figure 1 reveals that the height difference (husband's height
minus wife's height) increased with the husband's height (lin-
ear regression b ¼ .80, df ¼ 1,342, p < .001) and decreased with
the wife's height (b ¼ À.75, df ¼ 1,342, p < .001). Violation of
the male-taller norm occurred in the shortest male group and
the tallest female group. The length of lines above the histo-
gram represents the magnitude of the standard deviation of
height difference in each height category. Figure 2A shows the
actual frequency of each height difference category. Height
differences between 5 cm and 15 cm had a higher frequency
of occurring than the other categories. Figure 2B follows the
strategy proposed by Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al. (2013) to
calculate the relative likelihood of pairing, that is the actual
frequency observed in the population divided by the simulated
frequency resulting from random pairing. The actual frequency
was greater than the expected frequency from the simulations
for category of height difference of 5­10 and 11­15 cm. Figure
2B supports the male-not-too-tall norm.
Whether assortative mating with respect to height varies
with age cohort, educational level, and family income was
explored further in Table 2. The correlation coefficients
between the height of male and female spouses were significant
in all groups, indicating that the assorative mating with respect
to height prevailed in all groups. The correlation coefficients
for the old cohort were greater than the young cohort. Likewise,
the association between the heights of male and female spouses
was greater for high family income group than low family
income group. As on average, the old were richer than the
young, it is possible that the relationship between family
income and spouse's height is a reflection of the relationship
between age and family income.
Simulated Distribution and Actual Distribution
Among the 1,344 couples, there were only 32 couples where
the wife was taller than the husband, comprising only 2.38% of
4 Evolutionary Psychology
the sample (see Table 3), compared to 4.09% in Stulp, Buunk,
Pollet, et al. (2013). Of course, as in this sample, husbands on
average were taller than their wives by more than 11 cm, it was
expected by chance that husbands were taller than wives in
most cases. However, if assortative mating in the marriage
market indeed conforms to the male-taller norm, then this
2.38% would be significantly less than the breakage proportion
of the male-taller norm resulting from a random sorting.
Table 3 records the maximal and minimal number of cases
in which a wife was taller than her husband in the 200 random
simulations. The maximal number and the minimal number of
cases violating the male-taller norm were 84 and 46, respec-
tively. Both numbers were much higher than the actual num-
ber of violation cases, 32. The frequency of violation cases,
that is, a wife taller than her husband, in each simulation was
never less than 32. The second column of Table 3 shows the
percentage of cases violating the male-taller norm. The per-
centage of the cases violating the male-taller norm for the
maximal number of cases was 6.25%, while for the minimal
number of cases, it was 3.42%; both percentages were greater
than the actual violation percentage, 2.38%. The third column
presents Z tests for the percentages of the cases violating the
male-taller norm in the random sorting with respect to the
actual violation percentage. All three Z values significantly
rejected the null hypothesis that violation percentages for the
cases in the random sorting were equal to or less than the
actual violation percentage.
The difference between the actual violation percentage and
the violation percentage generated from 200 random simulations
was small. From another angle, the difference in the number of
violation cases between the actual situation and the simulations
was substantial. The actual number of violation cases was 32, but
the average amount of violation cases in the 200 simulations was
65. This means that about half the number of male-taller viola-
tion cases were avoided. This provides evidence of the male-
taller norm. Furthermore, because most males were taller than
females, the percentages of violation cases in the simulations
were small. By its very nature, the difference of the violation
percentages between the actual situation and the random simula-
tion was also small. But this small percentage difference cannot
be used to deny the male-taller norm.

shows the median counts of 200 random simulations by height
difference. The values in the third row are the p values for each
height difference category. For example, in the 200 simula-
tions, none of the simulated counts in the ``less than 0'' cate-
gory were less than or equal to the actual counts, 32, so the
p value obtained was less than 1/200 ¼ .005. This p value
corresponds to the directional hypothesis that the simulated
counts are either over- or underrepresented compared to the
actual counts (Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al., 2013). The p values
for the categories of less than 0, 0­4, 16­20, and greater than 21
were left tailed, while the p values for 5­10 and 11­15 were
right tailed. The actual counts in the 5­10 and 11­15 cm cate-
gories were significantly higher than what would be expected
by chance, while the actual counts in the categories less than
5 cm and greater than 20 cm were significantly lower than
what would be expected by chance. Due to the missing values
of explanatory variables, 723 couples are deleted. Using the
same simulation approach, the same results are obtained from
the 2,067 couples. That is, the actual counts of height differ-
ence between 5 and 15 cm were higher than what would be
expected by chance. The deletion of observations does not
change the conclusion.
Ordered Probit Models
The advantage of regression is that it can control for other
factors and specifically focus on the pure relationship between
the heights of husbands and wives. In Table 5, the dependent
variables of the left panel and right panel are husband's height
and wife's height, respectively. The middle group of spouse's
height was the comparison reference and is not shown in
Table 5. The left panel and the right panel of Table 5, respec-
tively, show the husband and wife results of the ordered probit
models. Height between 155 and 160 cm was the wife height
reference group, while height between 166 and 170 cm was the
husband height reference group. In other words, the groups of
average heights for males and females were used as the respec-
tive reference groups. Neither reference group was shown in
the table. The explanatory variables included four categories of
spouse height, respondents' and spouse's educational years and
age, and logarithm family income. Family income was taken as
the logarithm because the ordered probit models cannot con-
verge if the family income did not take a logarithm. Spouse's
age was not incorporated into the explanatory variables due to a
multicollinearity concern. In this sample, the correlation coef-
ficient between a husband's age and his wife's age was .72.
When spouse's age was included in the model, the coefficient
of spouse's age in either husband model or in wife model
showed a reverse sign as expected. We expected that the young
generation would be taller than the old generation, but the
coefficients of spouse's age were significantly positive, indi-
cating that old spouses were coupled with tall respondents.
Given the high correlation between spouse's ages, this is likely
to be a consequence of multicollinearity. Therefore, the
spouse's age was excluded. In fact, Dormann et al. (2013)
indicated that multicollinearity begins to severely distort model
estimation when |r| > .7. Tabachnick and Fidell (2014) also
suggested deleting the highly correlated variable when |r| > .7.
In the left panel, the coefficients of wife's height categories
shorter than and taller than the average height group were
negatively and positively significant at least at the 10% level,
respectively. Husband's education and age were respectively
positively and negatively significant at the 1% level. Husbands

Note. Table 2 divides age, educational attainment, and family income into two groups. The number of observations is 1,344. Husbands younger or equal to 40
(median) years old were classified into the young group, whereas others into the old group. The median age for wives was 37, and the same classification rule
was applied. Educational attaintment less than or equal to high school was defined as low education, whereas higher than high school was high education. Family
income less than or equal to the median family income, NT$55,000, was low family income, and high family income if greater than the median family income.

with higher educational attainment and younger age were tal-
ler. Highly educated wives were coupled with tall men. Rich
families had tall husbands.
The right panel of Table 5 shows the results for wives. The
coefficients of husband height categories shorter than 166 were
significant at the 5% level. The coefficient of the tallest hus-
band category was significant, while that of 171­175 group
was not significant. Although for women it seems to indicate
that husband's height were indistinguishable between the
height groups of 171­175 and 166­170, the next table (mar-
ginal probability table) shows that men of 171­175 had a sig-
nificantly different chance to be married to women of a
different height category. The absolute values of the coeffi-
cients of age and family income and their t-values in the right
panel were smaller than husband's corresponding values in the
left panel.
Notably, ordered probit models are not linear. Unlike coef-
ficients of ordinary least squares (OLS) models, coefficients of
ordered probit models are not marginal effects of their corre-
sponding variables. The marginal effects are in terms of prob-
ability and vary with the quantity of the independent variables
in question. Computer software provides a marginal probability
effect of an independent variable at its average and at the
other variables' averages. The marginal probability effect of
a dummy variable, such as spouse height groups, is the prob-
ability change from the reference group to a group in question.
The top and bottom panels of Table 6 exhibit the marginal
probability effects of the ordered probit models as husband's
height and wife's height are the dependent variables, respec-
tively. Each independent variable was associated with five
marginal probability effects. For example, in the top panel, the
five marginal probability effects of husband's education were
À.004, À.008, À.003, .007, and .007. Each of these five mar-
ginal probabilities corresponded to each husband height cate-
gory in the top row. The probabailty À.004 meant that an
increment of 1 year of education decreased the probability by
.004 of falling in the category of less than or equal to 160 cm.
By the same token, the increment of 1 year of education
decreased the probability by .008 and .003, respectively, falling
into the 161­165 and 166­170 cm categories, and increased the
probability by .007 and .007, respectively, falling into the 171­
175 and >175 cm categories. These five marginal probabilities
were calculated using Equation 4, and their sum was zero. The
marginal probability of a husband's educational attainment was
negative and became positive as a husband's height increased.
This property reflects the positive coefficient of husband's
educational attainment in Table 5.
In the top panel of Table 6, wife's height between 156 and
160 cm was the reference group which is not shown in the
table. Any marginal probability of the wife's height category
was the difference between that category and the reference
category. For example, the first value in the first column

Note. The height difference is a husband's height minus his wife's height. Median counts is the median in each height difference category of the 200 simulations.
p Value for each category is calculated by dividing the number of simulations in which the number of the simulated counts is less than or equal to the number of
actual counts. For example, for none of the 200 simulations were their simulated counts less than or equal to the actual counts (32), so the p < 1/200 ¼ .005. The
sample size for Table 4 is 1,344.

Tao 7
(.050) meant that a wife measuring less than or equal to 150 cm
was more likely than a wife in the reference group to be mar-
ried to a husband with a height of less than or equal to 160 cm
by a probability of .050. This marginal probability was signif-
icant at the 1% level. Taking the category of wife height
between 161­165 cm as an example, compared to the reference
group, the marginal probability of women in this height cate-
gory being coupled with a man whose height was less than or
equal to 160, 161­165, 166­170, 171­175, and >175 cm were
À.015, À.035, À.015, .032, and .033, respectively. Compared
to the height reference group, women in the taller groups were
more unlikely to be married to a man shorter than 171 cm and
more likely to be married to a man taller than 175 cm. With
wives who were taller than the reference group, the absolute
value of the negative marginal probability increased with
women's height, suggesting that taller women were more
unlikely to be married to short men. Likewise, the positive
marginal probability of the taller women also increased with
women's height, indicating that taller women were more likely
to be married to tall men. When wives were shorter than the
reference group, the positive marginal probability and the abso-
lute value of the negative marginal probability decreased as
wife's height increased. These figures indicated that short
women were more likely to be married to short men and less
likely to be married to tall men, respectively.
Positive values in Table 6 indicated that the height match in
question had a higher probability to occur than the correspond-
ing match in the reference group. Wives shorter than 156 cm
were more likely to be married to husbands shorter than 166
cm. The height difference between a husband and wife was

approximately within a range of 5 (160 À 155) to 15 (165 À
150) cm. Wives taller than 160 cm were more likely to be
married to husbands taller than 175 cm. In this case, the height
difference between a husband and his wife was approximately
within a range of 10 (175 À 165) to 15 (175 À 160) cm.
In the bottom panel, the coefficients of husband's height
showed a similar pattern to the top panel. Notably, com-
pared to the reference group (husband's height between 166
and 170 cm), husbands shorter than 166 cm were more
likely to be married to wives shorter than 156 cm. The
height difference was approximately 5 (160 À 155) to 15
(165 À 150) cm. Husbands taller than 170 cm were more
likely to be married to a wife taller than 165 cm. The height
difference was also roughly within the range of 5 (170 À 165)
to 10 (175 À 165) cm.
Discussion
The height data from the ESCNHS were self-reported.
Although measured height is more precise than self-reported
height, several studies have reported that these two measure-
ments are highly correlated. For example, Spencer, Appleby,
Davey, and Key (2002) and Wada et al. (2005) reported that
correlation coefficients between measured and self-reported
height were greater than .9 for British persons, .979 for Japa-
nese men, and .988 for Japanese women, respectively. People
tend to overreport their height and to underreport their weight.
Using self-reported stature to calculate body mass index might
therefore underestimate the problem of obesity (Spencer,
Appleby, Davey, & Key, 2002). However, the bias of using
self-reported height to investigate height difference between a
husband and his wife is limited as both sexes tend to overreport
their height and the overestimates will be canceled out. There is
no agreement about which sex overreports their height more
than the other sex. Some studies found that men overreported
their height more than women (Krul, Daanen, & Choi, 2011),
some indicated that men and women overreported their height
by the same magnitude (Wada et al., 2005), and some even
found that women overreported more than men (Lucca &
Moura, 2010).
In each society, there seems to exist an ideal height differ-
ence between a male and his female spouse. The ideal range of
height difference consists of an upper and lower bound. This
ideal range of height difference in the United Kingdom is
probably 0­25 cm (Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al., 2013), and it
is 5­15 cm in Taiwan. The stereotype gender role implies that a
husband has to be significantly taller than his wife. Hence, the
sex-role impression cannot be created when the height differ-
ence between a couple is less than the lower bound of the
ideal range. If shortness reflects liabilities of personal traits
(Agerstro
¨m, 2014; Jackson & Ervin, 1992; Judge & Cable,
2004), then women dislike looking too short for their partners.
Men also dislike their partners to look too short relative to
themselves. This societal expectation constructs the upper
bound of the ideal range of the height difference between
a couple. Women prefer a mate taller than themselves.
Evolutionary psychology and resource access can explain this
male-taller norm phenomena. However, these two hypotheses
cannot explain why women do not prefer a mate much taller
than themselves. If tall men are a symbol of dominance, com-
petitiveness, and resource access, then all women, regardless of
their own height, will desire the same group of tall men. But
this contradicts what we observed. The recent finding of the
male-not-too-tall norm implies more hypotheses are needed to
explain why women prefer a mate taller but not much taller
than themselves.
The lower bound is probably determined by the societal
characteristics, in particular the degree of sex equality. The
degree of sex stereotype is low in sex equal societies, and
consequently, these societies possess a small lower bound of
the ideal range of the height difference. The Global Gender
Gap Index (GGGI) was constructed by the World Economic
Forum to measure sex equality among countries. A large GGGI
indicates a highly sex equal society. The lower bound of the
height difference observed in the United Kingdom is 0, while in
Taiwan is 5. Correspondingly, the GGGI for the United King-
dom in 2014 was .7383, greater than the GGGI for Taiwan in
the same year which was .7214.1
The upper bound of the ideal range is likely to vary with
societal expectation and the stature property of a population.
From the perspective of the stature property, Euopeans are
taller than Asians. It seems that tall populations have a greater
upper bound than short populations. As tall populations have a
greater height variance than short populations (Schmitt &
Harrison, 1988), a great upper bound of the ideal height differ-
ence in tall populations is able to contain a sufficiently large
pool of mates. This stature property of a population might be
the biological basis of the formation of societal expectation. In
other words, a male taller than his female spouse by more than
the upper bound would be seen as a weird couple which actu-
ally implies that a sufficiently large pool of mates has been
reached with a smaller height difference in this population.
This might explain why the observed upper bound of the height
difference in Taiwan was smaller than in the United Kingdom.
Cohen (2013) published a nonacademic article in the Atlantic.
He used 4,600 couples from the data set of the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics of the United States in 2009 to run 10 ran-
dom simulations for height match. From the figure he drew, the
actual height difference was roughly within a range between
À0.5 and 22 cm (À0.2 and 8.5 in.) which occurred more often
than expected by chance. The GGGI for the United States in
2014 was .7463, greater than the United Kingdom. The range of
height difference occurring more than expected in the United
States was in line with the aforementioned arguments. How-
ever, the lack of studies on this issue does not allow us to make
a persuasive conclusion. Further studies are encouraged to
explore this issue in different populations.
This study used Taiwanese data to examine the prevalence
of the male-taller and the male-not-too-tall norms in Taiwan.
Consistent with previous studies using Western populations
(Pawlowski, 2003; Salska et al., 2008; Swami et al., 2008), the
relative height for Taiwanese couples was large for tall men
Tao 9
and short women and small for short men and tall women. This
provides evidence for the male-taller norm because tall men
and short women have a greater buffer than short men and tall
women to conform to the male-taller norm. As expected, the
shorter the husband or the taller the wife, the more likely the
violation of the male-taller norm. The uneven distribution of
the number of cases violating the male-taller norm is also evi-
dence for the male-taller norm because short men and tall
women find it more difficult to avoid the violation of the
male-taller norm. Women want taller men more than men want
shorter women (Stulp, Buunk, Kurzban, & Verhulst, 2013;
Stulp, Buunk, & Pollet, 2013). From another perspective, the
high violation proportion of the male-taller norm for tall
women indicates that the male-taller norm is not essential.
After all, stature is only one of multiple dimensions considered
in a marriage. In addition, the taller the husbands, the more
family income and years of education they had. These results
were in line with the findings in the literature (Bo
¨ckerman &
Vainioma
¨ki, 2013; Case & Paxson, 2008; Cinnirella et al.,
2011; Meyer & Selmer, 1999; Kortt & Leigh, 2010; Lundborg
et al., 2014; Magnusson et al., 2006; Persico et al., 2004; Sil-
ventionen et al., 1999; Szklarska et al., 2007).
An OLS model can verify the overall relationship between
husband's height and wife's height by controlling for other
factors. However, this continuous variable model cannot exam-
ine which height group of women is more likely to be coupled
with which height group of men. This is why the continuous
variable of height was categorized, and an ordered probit model
was applied. The subjective categorization on height implies
that the application of the ordered probit model is not a perfect
methodology, but it gives alternative results and conclusions
that an OLS model would be unable to give. With the control of
other factors, an OLS model can verify the male-taller norm,
but it cannot verify the male-not-too-tall norm. An ordered
probit model is able to verify the male-taller norm as well as
the male-not-too-tall norm at the same time. The results of the
ordered probit models demonstrated that tall men were more
likely to be coupled with tall women, whereas short men were
more likely to be coupled with short women. These results
verified the prevalence of the male-taller norm in Taiwan. The
results of the ordered probit models further confirmed the pre-
valence of the male-not-too-tall norm in Taiwan. The fre-
quency of the height difference between a husband and his
wife to be within the range of 5­15 cm was significantly higher
than other ranges. This range was consistent with the result of
the random simulations.
Using Indonesian data, Sohn (2015) found that 93.4% of
actual couples were in line with the male-taller norm, statisti-
cally more than 88.8% of random couples. Despite the signif-
icant difference between random mating and actual mating,
Sohn (2015) argued that the small difference only made statis-
tical sense and concluded a lack of evidence for the male-taller
norm in Indonesia. The difference of violation ratios between
the actual mating and the random mating in Taiwan was only
about 2.5% on average, but this study showed that this small
difference still differed from chance. The average number of
cases violating the male-taller norm in the random mating was
more than 2 times the size of the actual mating.
Preferred characteristics and actual characteristics of mates
usually differ (Courtiol, Picq, Godelle, Raymond, & Ferdy,
2010). This difference occurs for at least two reasons. First,
preferred characteristics are usually compromised in actual
matches (Stulp, Buunk, Kurzban, et al., 2013). Second, a pos-
itive association between the heights of a man and his female
spouse from the actual couple data might reflect the assortative
mating with respect to factors other than height. For example,
we have seen that educational attainment was positively corre-
lated with height. The assortative mating with respect to edu-
cation also supports the positive association between the
heights of a male and of his female spouse. This was of course
not the case for the present study because the ordered probit
