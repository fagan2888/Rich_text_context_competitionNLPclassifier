Chronic Liver Disease Mortality in the United States,
1990­1998
Sirenda Vong1,2 and Beth P. Bell1
In 1998, chronic liver disease (CLD) was the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S. Alcohol
and hepatitis C are thought to be important etiologies. However, traditional methods for
calculating CLD mortality rates from death certificates may underestimate hepatitis C-
related CLD mortality. We studied patterns of CLD deaths reported from 1990 through
1998, using an expanded definition that included death certificates where CLD, viral hepa-
titis, or CLD-related sequelae were reported as the underlying cause. We calculated overall
age-specific and age-adjusted mortality rates, and according to demographic characteristics
and recorded causes, and evaluated trends using linear regression modeling. CLD mortality
declined 5% overall from 1990 through 1994 (12.1 to 11.6/100,000; P  0.002), but
remained unchanged from 1995 through 1998 (P  0.366). Decreases were similar for all
causes except hepatitis C, for which rates increased 220% from 1993 to 1998 (0.57 to
1.67/100,000). Rates declined in all racial-ethnic groups except American Indians and
Alaska Natives (AI/AN), among whom rates were unchanged. Of 30,933 CLD deaths in
1998, 39% were coded as alcohol related, 15% as hepatitis C, 4% as hepatitis B, and 44% had
no recorded cause. Age-adjusted rates were higher among males (47.6/100,000) than females
(32.2/100,000) and among Hispanics (19.1/100,000) compared with non-Hispanics (10.8/
100,000). Rates among AI/AN (28.7/100,000) were more than twice those of African Amer-
icans and whites (12.9/100,000 and 11.5/100,000, respectively). In conclusion, 1998 CLD
deaths and the proportion attributable to viral hepatitis increased by 23% and 19%, respec-
tively, compared with traditional methods. Mortality declines of the early 1990s were not
sustained after 1994. Large disparities in CLD mortality remain, particularly among Amer-
ican Indians and Alaska Natives. (HEPATOLOGY 2004;39:476­483.)
In 1998, chronic liver disease (CLD) was classified as
the tenth most frequent cause of death in the United
States according to the national vital statistics report.1
Excessive alcohol intake and viral hepatitis infections are
thought to be two important causes. However, the con-
tribution of viral hepatitis infections to CLD-related mor-
tality has been difficult to determine.
Traditional methods used to calculate CLD mortality
using death certificate data may result in underestimation
of the proportion of CLD mortality attributable to viral
hepatitis. These analyses use a single group of Interna-
tional Classification of Disease (ICD) codes to define
deaths from CLD, which does not include one for viral
hepatitis.1,2 Thus, deaths coded as resulting from viral
hepatitis are not counted as CLD related. Further, causes
of CLD-related deaths, when defined using traditional
methods, can be designated essentially only as alcohol
related or not.
Previous estimates of viral hepatitis-related CLD mor-
tality have relied on extrapolation of data from morbidity
studies. Population-based studies of patients diagnosed
with chronic liver disease have found hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection, either alone or in combination with
excessive alcohol consumption, to be the most frequently
identified cause (40%-60%), and hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection to be related to a relatively small proportion of
cases (15%).3,4 However, extrapolation from morbidity
studies may result in inaccurate estimates of deaths if the

that to morbidity.5
We report the results of an analysis death certificate
data that makes use of all the information available on
death certificates to identify deaths attributable to CLD of
any cause. We describe rates and trends in CLD mortality
in the United States from 1990 through 1998, according
to recorded causes using this less restrictive definition of
CLD.
Materials and Methods
Deaths occurring from 1990 through 1998 were ana-
lyzed using the Multiple-Cause Mortality Files, compiled
annually from death certificates by the National Center
for Health Statistics.6 Multiple-Cause Mortality Files in-
clude demographic and location of death information on
each decedent, ICD Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for
the underlying cause of death, and a list of up to 20
conditions contributing to the death listed on the death
certificate. We used the record axis format, which applies
an algorithm to what the physician enters on the death
certificate, to determine the underlying cause of death,
conditions contributing to death, and relative importance
of these conditions.7,8 This format applies standard crite-
ria to define the underlying cause of death and to improve
the internal consistency of each certificate.
We defined CLD as chronic liver disease and cirrhosis
(ICD-9 codes 571.0­571.9), all viral hepatitis except
hepatitis A (ICD-9 codes 070.2­070.9, representing hep-
atitis B, hepatitis C, and unspecified viral hepatitis infec-
tions), and selected sequelae of chronic liver disease
(ICD-9 codes 572.2­572.4, corresponding to hepatic
coma, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome).
We selected all records on which any of these CLD-defin-
ing conditions were recorded in the underlying cause of
death field. We then looked for a potential cause of CLD
in the underlying or contributing cause of death fields and
categorized CLD cases into the following six etiologic
disease groups: alcohol related, HCV related, HBV re-
lated, primary biliary cirrhosis related, unspecified viral
hepatitis related, and no cause.
We calculated age-specific mortality rates by grouping
age into 0 to 4 years of age and 10-year categories from 5
to 14 years of age to 85 years of age. We calculated
age-adjusted annual mortality rates per 100,000 persons
using direct standardization with the 2000 census popu-
lation.9 We used the following racial and ethnic groups as
provided in the mortality data: whites, African Ameri-
cans, Asians or Pacific Islanders (A/PI), American Indians
or Alaska Natives (AI/AN), Hispanics, and non-Hispan-
ics. We also examined the geographic distribution of
CLD by state. Population estimates for noncensus years
were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Within each group, a linear model was fit to the annual
age-adjusted mortality rates to assess the significance of
the change in rates over time. The percentage change in
rates was estimated using the linear model by dividing the
estimated 9-year rate change by the estimated 1990 rate.
Because effective testing to diagnose HCV infection only
became available in the early 1990s, we assessed trends
and calculated the change in the mortality rate for CLD
related to hepatitis C beginning in 1993. The F statistic at
P value  0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Trends in CLD Deaths, 1990­1998
From 1990 through 1998, the age-adjusted death rate
for CLD decreased 4.5% from 12.1 to 11.6/100,000
(P  0.002). The decline only occurred from 1990
through 1994; there was no change in the rate from 1995
through 1998 (Fig. 1). During this study period, age-
adjusted death rates decreased in both genders, by 6.4%
among males (P  0.0002) and by 3.2% among females
(P  0.09). Age-adjusted death rates declined among Af-
rican Americans (29.7%; P  0.001), A/PI (17.4%;
P  0.041), and non-Hispanics (3.7%; P  0.003), but
increased among AI/AN (10.8%; P  0.058; Table 1).
Rates remained unchanged for whites (0.5%; P  0.30)
and Hispanics (1.2%; P  0.30).
In 1990, age-adjusted death rates for CLD were high-
est for the group with no cause identified. From 1990
through 1998, overall age-adjusted death rates for the
group with no etiology identified decreased by 19.5%
(P  0.0001; Fig. 2). This decrease occurred in both
genders and among most racial or ethnic groups, with the
largest decrease among African Americans (34.3%; P 
0.001); only among AI/AN were the rates not signifi-
cantly different (9.6%; P  0.23; Table 2). Overall
rates for alcohol-related CLD declined 10.5% (P

0.0004; Fig. 2), with the greatest decrease occurring
among African Americans (45.2%; P  0.001). Among
AI/AN, however, these rates increased by 14.1%, from
16.0/100,000 to 19.0/100,000 (P  0.071). For primary
biliary cirrhosis, the age-adjusted death rates increased
overall (12.8%; P  0.002) and among females, whites,
and both Hispanics and non-Hispanics.
For HBV-related CLD, overall age-adjusted death
rates remained unchanged from 1990 through 1998
(9.5%; P  0.125; Fig. 2); this trend was similar to that
among A/PI, the group with the highest HBV-related
death rates, but increases occurred among Hispanics
(40.5%; P  0.011) and African Americans (31.3%; P 
0.003; Table 2). A 220% increase in HCV-related CLD
deaths occurred from 1993 through 1998 (0.57­1.67/
100,000; P  0.0001; Table 2; Fig. 2), concurrent with a
45% decrease in deaths from unspecified viral hepatitis
(0.11/100,000­0.06/100,000; P  0.004). For HCV,
similar trends were observed among both genders and all
racial and ethnic groups.
Deaths and Death Rates in 1998
Chronic liver disease accounted for 30,933 (1.3%)
of the 2,338,070 deaths that occurred in the United
States during 1998 (mortality rate, 11.6/100,000).
These deaths included 25,236 (81.6%) in which the
ICD-9 code for chronic liver disease or cirrhosis
(571.0­571.9 codes) was listed as the underlying cause
of death. The remaining included 4,707 (15.2%)
deaths related to viral hepatitis (070.2­070.9 codes)
and 990 (3.2%) deaths from CLD sequelae (selected
572.2­572.4 codes). A total of 12,187 (39.4%) deaths

were alcohol related; 4,443 (14.5%) were HCV re-
lated, of which 3,340 deaths were the result of hepatitis
C alone; 1,161 (3.8%) were HBV related; and for
13,683 (44.2%), no cause was recorded (Fig. 3).
Age-Specific Rates. Most (98%) decedents were aged
25 years and older, and the highest age-specific death rate
(36.9/100,000) was in the 65- to 74-year age group.
Among males, age-specific death rates peaked in the 65-
to 74-year age group (47.6/100,000), but among females
in the 75- to 84-year age group (32.2/100,000; data not
shown). Among AI/AN compared with white persons and
African Americans, and in the alcohol-related group com-
pared with groups with other causes, the highest age-spe-
cific death rates occurred at an earlier age, in the 55- to
64-year age group (Figs. 4 and 5).
Age-Adjusted Rates. A total of 19,904 (64.3%)
deaths occurred among men, and age-adjusted rates for
men were more than two times higher than for women
(16.3/100,000 vs. 7.5/100,000; P  0.001). Eighty-five
percent of deaths occurred among whites, 11% among
African Americans, 2% among AI/AN, and 2% among
A/PI. However, age-adjusted death rates were highest
among AI/AN (28.7/100,000), followed by African
Americans (12.9/100,000), whites (11.5/100,000), and
A/PI (4.1/100,000; Table 1). Deaths among Hispanics
accounted for 12% of CLD-related deaths, and their age-
adjusted rates were more than 1.5 times more than among
non-Hispanics (19.1/100,000 vs. 10.8/100,000; P 
0.001; Table 1).
In 1998, the highest age-adjusted CLD death rates
continued to occur among persons with no cause identi-
fied (Table 2). Among deaths for which a cause was re-
corded, age-adjusted alcohol-related death rates were
highest, and more than three times higher among AI/AN
than among those in other racial or ethnic groups. A total
of 68% of all CLD deaths among AI/AN were recorded as
alcohol related. In contrast to 1993, the overall age-ad-
justed death rate for HCV-related CLD exceeded that for
HBV-related and primary biliary cirrhosis-related CLD.
In the HBV-related group, the highest death rates contin-
ued to occur in A/PI, and in the HCV-related group,
death rates were highest among AI/AN, African Ameri-
cans, men, and Hispanics compared with other racial
groups, women, and non-Hispanics.
Discussion
Traditionally, CLD-related mortality data are tabu-
lated and analyzed using the ICD-9 definition of CLD
(coded as 571). Codes in this "571" group allow for des-
ignation of alcohol-related CLD but not for CLD related
to viral hepatitis,7 leading to an underestimation of both
the number of CLD-related deaths and the proportion
attributable to viral hepatitis. Our study demonstrates
that by expanding the definition of death from CLD to
include codes for viral hepatitis and relevant sequelae of
CLD listed in the underlying cause of death field, the
number of 1998 CLD deaths increased by nearly 23%,
and the proportion of CLD deaths attributable to viral
hepatitis increased by 19%. Further, in contrast to re-
ported trends defined only as 571 codes, the decline in
CLD mortality observed during previous decades and sus-
tained through the early 1990s did not continue after
1994, largely because of increases in HCV-related
deaths.2,10

The overall decrease in CLD mortality rates during the
study period was 16% when restricted to the 571 codes in
the underlying cause of death field, but only 5% when
codes for viral hepatitis and CLD sequelae were included,
suggesting that decreases in CLD deaths not related to
viral hepatitis were counterbalanced by an increase in
deaths from CLD caused by chronic hepatitis C. Large
increases in HCV-related mortality rates occurred begin-
ning in 1993, which likely were related primarily to im-
proved awareness of and testing for HCV infection
among CLD patients.11 Consistent with this explanation
is the finding that the percent increases in HCV-related
mortality were similar across all demographic groups,
whereas chronic infection rates are not.12 Nonetheless, by
1998, hepatitis C was listed on the death certificates of less
than 15% of decedents, and no cause was reported for
approximately half of deaths. In studies of patients with
CLD, approximately 40% to 60% have hepatitis C and
less than 10% have cryptogenic disease.3,4
The number of HCV-related CLD deaths identified in
1998 in this study was less than 4,500. When population-
based studies of CLD morbidity were used to estimate
annual mortality, 8,000 to 10,000 deaths from HCV-
related CLD were estimated.5 These differences suggest
that, similar to findings of studies examining the accuracy
of death certificates in identifying respiratory and cardio-
vascular diseases as causes of death, hepatitis C may be
underascertained among patients dying of chronic liver
disease, underreported on death certificates, or
both.3,4,13­16 In the only study to date of which we are
aware that addressed this issue by comparing mortality
data with medical records, the potential magnitude of
underreporting of hepatitis C on death certificates was
estimated to be approximately 50%.17 If this estimate was
consistent across the country, hepatitis C should have
been recorded as causing approximately 9,000 (30%)
CLD deaths in 1998. Alternatively, mortality from
chronic hepatitis C may be much lower than morbidity
from the disease.
Alcoholic liver disease was the CLD cause most fre-
quently identified on the death certificates and had the
highest age-adjusted mortality rate among deaths for
which a cause appeared on the certificate. Other studies
have suggested substantial underreporting of alcohol-re-
lated conditions on death certificates.10 The epidemio-
logic factors of alcohol-related CLD deaths we observed
were consistent with the demographic distribution and
temporal trends of heavy alcohol consumption in the
United States,18,19 with higher death rates among men,
AI/AN, and Hispanics and an overall 10% decline in
alcohol-related CLD mortality during the decade.
AI/AN populations carried a disproportionate mortal-
ity burden from CLD, highlighting the need for im-
proved primary and secondary prevention measures.
Death rates among AI/AN were more than twice those of
other racial groups, and in contrast to trends observed in
other racial groups, age-adjusted rates increased during
the decade. Excess CLD mortality observed among
AI/AN may be attributed partly to documented higher
rates of alcohol consumption in this population.20 Al-
though death rates from non­alcohol-related CLD were
not higher among AI/AN compared with other racial
groups, it is possible that because alcoholism is prevalent
among AI/AN, deaths may be more often ascribed to
alcoholic liver disease at the expense of other causes, com-
pared with other racial groups.2 The higher frequency of
CLD mortality of unknown cause among whites com-
pared with AI/AN may be an illustration of this phenom-
enon.
HBV-related death rates were highest among A/PI, as
may be expected because of the high prevalence of HBV
infection in this population.21 We also observed high rates
among AI/AN, African Americans, and persons of His-
panic ethnicity and significant increases in death rates

during the study period among African Americans and
Hispanics. These findings are consistent with results of
national prevalence surveys,21 but to our knowledge have
not been reported previously. Results of catalytic model-
ing indicated a decline in the prevalence of HBV infection
between the time periods 1976 through 1980 and 1988
through 1994.21 It will be important to continue to mon-
itor race- and ethnicity-specific HBV-related CLD mor-
tality rates to determine if this predicted decline in the
prevalence of infection is reflected in declines in mortal-
ity.
Deaths from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were
not included in this analysis. The addition of 1990
through 1998 HCC deaths would have increased overall
CLD death rates only by approximately 4%, because
death resulting from HCC is relatively uncommon com-
pared with death from CLD in the United States.22 How-
ever, the effect of including HCC deaths on race- or
ethnicity-specific mortality rates is unclear; a published
study of recent trends in HCC deaths in the United States
considered only whites and African Americans.22 The
findings of this study with respect to the cause of HCC
deaths were consistent with those of this analysis of CLD
deaths in that the observed rising trend was attributed in
part to increases in HBV- and HCV-related HCC.22
Since 1999, the ICD-10 classification has been used to
code causes of death on death certificates.23 When the
number of CLD deaths in 1999 coded with ICD-9 codes
was compared with those coded with ICD-10 codes, the
number of CLD deaths was 4% higher using ICD-10
codes.24 Some ICD-9 conditions such as "alcohol depen-
dence syndrome" (303 code) and "unspecified hepatitis"
(573.3 code) have been included in the CLD category in
ICD-10. Moreover, because of changes in algorithms for
determining the underlying cause of death, CLD is se-
lected as the underlying cause of death instead of, for
example, pneumonia, when both are listed in the death
certificate.24 However, the number of viral hepatitis
deaths was 18% lower when ICD-10 codes were used
compared with ICD-9 codes,24 mainly because human
immunodeficiency virus infection was selected systemat-
ically as the underlying cause of death when the death
certificate listed both human immunodeficiency virus and
viral hepatitis infections. In addition, this revision carries
forward coding conventions that may perpetuate under-
recording of viral hepatitis as a cause of CLD deaths.
Similar to the ICD-9 classification, the group of CLD
codes is divided into alcoholic liver disease and other
chronic liver disease; there is no category in this group of
codes for viral hepatitis.24 Thus, the coding conventions
we have identified in ICD-9 that result in an underesti-
mation of the contribution of viral hepatitis to CLD mor-
tality are likely to persist with ICD-10.
In conclusion, this analysis highlights large disparities
in CLD mortality, demonstrating the need for social and
public health interventions that target high-risk groups
such as AI/AN and Hispanic Americans. CLD, as defined
in ICD, cannot be used to monitor trends accurately in
CLD mortality, and the divergence can be expected to
increase as more deaths from HCV-related CLD are re-
corded using viral hepatitis rather than CLD ICD codes.
In contrast to previously reported trends that relied on the
CLD codes in ICD,25 after a decline in CLD mortality in
the early 1990s, overall mortality remained unchanged
when an expanded definition of CLD was used. In gen-
eral, cause-specific mortality is reflected poorly in death
certificate data. Consistent with some authors' sugges-
tions,26,27 future analyses of CLD mortality and its causes
should include viral hepatitis and sequelae of CLD deaths
because of the narrow definition of CLD in ICD. Further
studies are needed to evaluate the validity of estimates of
the mortality burden from CLD generated from national
mortality data and to characterize better the causes of
CLD deaths.
