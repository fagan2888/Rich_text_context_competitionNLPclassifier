Introduction
Kidney transplantation is the choice of treatment for end-
stage renal disease (ESRD). Limited cadaveric transplan-
tation is insufficient to meet the demand and living donor
kidney transplantation has been performed since the
1950s and the success rate has increased in the following
years.1 Kidney recipients are followed by transplant clin-
ics, but information about the renal outcomes of donors
has recently been published.2,3

Abstract
Background: Urinary angiotensinogen (uAGT) has recently been proposed as a marker of kidney injury and activated
intrarenal renin­angiotensin system. We investigated the effects of living donor nephrectomy on uAGT levels, blood
pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria and compensatory hypertrophy in the remaining kidney of
living kidney donors.
Methods: Twenty living kidney donors were included in the study and followed for 1 year. uAGT levels were
measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay preoperatively and postoperatively at the 15th day, 1, 6 and 12
months.
Results: Four donors were excluded from the study due to lack of data. The mean baseline estimated glomerular
filtration rate was 98 ± 15 ml/min/1.73 m². Serum creatinine, uAGT/creatinine, uAGT/protein levels were higher and
estimated glomerular filtration rate was lower than baseline values at all time periods. Urinary protein/creatinine levels
increased after donor nephrectomy, but after 6 months they returned to baseline values. Renal volume increased
after nephrectomy, but these changes did not show any correlation with uAGT/creatinine, uAGT/protein, estimated
glomerular filtration rate or systolic/diastolic blood pressures. uAGT/creatinine at 6 months and urinary protein/
creatinine ratio at 12 months showed a positive correlation (P=0.008, r=0.639).
Conclusion: After donor nephrectomy, increasing uAGT levels can be the result of activation of the intrarenal renin­
angiotensin system affecting the compensatory changes in the remaining kidney. The long-term effects of increased
uAGT levels on the remaining kidney should be examined more closely in future studies.

Many compensatory changes occur after nephrectomy,
including increased renal blood flow, effective renal plasma
flow, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and decreased
afferent and efferent arteriolar pressures.4 These haemody-
namic changes result in increased glomerular pressure,
which may cause glomerulosclerosis. A low risk of the
development of ESRD in donors suggests that different pro-
tective mechanisms are involved in the long term.2,3
Angiotensin II (Ang II) is an important component of the
renin­angiotensin system (RAS), and is responsible for pre-
serving the fluid balance and vascular tone of the body by
showing its effect mainly on the afferent arteriole.
Nephrectomy changes the response of the kidney to Ang II
as an increase in renal resistance, and causes an increase in
glomerular pressure without causing blood pressure changes
as a result of the shift of the main effect from the afferent
arteriole to the efferent arteriole. Whether these changes are
due to systemic or intrarenal RAS effects is unknown.5
Urinary angiotensinogen (uAGT) is synthesised in proximal
tubule cells and then excreted to the tubular lumen. After
cleavage by renin, angiotensin I occurs and through the
angiotensin-converting enzyme, Ang II develops. Increased
intrarenal Ang II causes malignant hypertension and renal
damage in animal studies.6 In cell culture studies, Ang II
was responsible for the proliferation of glomerular cells,
type I collagen increase in mesangial cells and hypertrophy
of tubular cells. So Ang II has many effects on growth and
fibrogenesis in the kidney.7
uAGT is a marker of intrarenal RAS, but there is still a
debate as to whether it may be a marker or a result of renal
dysfunction. Previous studies showed that uAGT increases
in diabetic nephropathy, autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease, IgA nephropathy, chronic kidney disease
and kidney transplant recipients.8­12
In this study we aimed to investigate the effects of liv-
ing donor nephrectomy on uAGT levels, blood pressure,
GFR, proteinuria and compensatory hypertrophy of the
remnant kidney in living kidney donors during a 1-year
follow-up.
Materials and methods
This was a prospective cohort study performed after
approval by Ankara University School of Medicine ethics
committee for clinical studies in accordance with Helsinki
Declaration guidelines, and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants (19 July 2013; no.:
46004091/302-4). The Turkish Society of Hypertension
and Renal Diseases partially funded the cost of the study.
Living kidney donor candidates were evaluated between
July 2013 and May 2014 and 20 donors were included ino
the study. Demographic features (age, gender, body mass
index, body surface area (BSA)) were recorded. Physical
examination (office blood pressure) and biochemical
parameters (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine (Cre), uric
acid, sodium, potassium, urine protein/creatinine ratio
(UPCR)) were obtained preoperatively and postopera-
tively on the 15th day, 1, 6 and 12 months. GFR was esti-
mated with the CKD-EPI formula (GFR = 141 × min
(Scre/, 1) × max(Scre/, 1) ­ 1.209 × 0.993 age × 1.018
[if female] × 1.159 [if black];  is 0.7 for women and 0.9
for men,  is -0.329 for women and -0.411 for men, min
indicates the minimum of Scre/ or 1, and max indicates the
maximum of Scre/ or 1).13
All donors were analysed for kidney volume by ultra-
sonography before surgery and at months 6 and 12 to show
the compensatory hypertrophy in the remnant kidney.
Ultrasonography was performed with the Toshiba Applio
(Tokyo, Japan) by using a 2­4 MHz convex transducer by
one expert radiologist. Donors were scanned from a lateral
or posterolateral view for optimal visualisation of the kid-
ney. The maximum length of the kidney in the longitudinal
plane was measured. The width and thickness were meas-
ured in two orthogonal directions in the plane perpendicu-
lar to the longitudinal axis of the kidney at the level of the
renal hilum. The renal volume was calculated by multiply-
ing these three measurements with 0.523. The unit of
measurement was the centimetre (cm).14 Renal volumes
are corrected for BSA.15
Samples were collected preoperatively and postopera-
tively at the 15th day, 1, 6 and 12 months and refrigerated
at -80°C. uAGT measurements were made with a com-
mercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit (Human Total Angiotensinogen Assay Kit;
IBL, Japan) after all samples were collected. Urine sam-
ples were stored the night before the work day at +4°C.
ELISA measurements was based on the method recom-
mended by the manufacturer. The urine samples were
diluted 10-fold with enzyme immunoassay buffer. After
preparation of the samples, the antibody solution was
added to the precoated plate. Following the instructions in
the manual, the chromogen and stop solution was added,
respectively, and finally the plate was read on the plate
reader to obtain the standard curve, and the results were
calculated. The tests were performed in Ankara University
School of Medicine, Ibni-Sina Hospital, Research
Laboratory of the Department of Nephrology. The results
of uAGT were obtained as ng/ml. uAGT levels were nor-
malised with urinary creatinine and urinary protein.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical pack-
age for social science 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Demographic and clinical data are expressed as mean ± SD,
mean ± SE percentage, or, if the data showed no normal
distribution, as medians and ranges. Temporal changes in
individual parameters were analysed using the two-tailed
Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, repeated measures analysis of
variance followed by Bonferroni's post-test, or Friedman's
Kendi Celebi et al. 3
test followed by Dunn's post-test as appropriate. Spearman
and Pearson correlation tests were used to assess associa-
tions between variables. Mixed effects models were used to
evaluate the associations between study parameters over
time also after kidney donation. Significance was defined at
the 0.05 level.
Results
Twenty healthy donors were included in the study. Four
donors were excluded from the study due to lack of data.
After exclusions, 16 patients were included in the study. The
mean age of the donors was 48 ± 9 years. Three donors were
men and 13 donors were women. Five of the donors were
parents, eight donors were spouses, two donors were relatives
and one donor was a sibling. With the exception of one donor,
all donors had left nephrectomy. The baseline characteristics
of living kidney donors are presented in Table 1. Briefly, pre-
operative mean office systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 112
± 13 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 73 ± 8
mmHg. Mean body mass index was 29 ± 3 kg/m2 and BSA
was 1.79 ± 0.14 m2. Fasting plasma glucose was 87 ± 9 mg/
dl. Urinary protein was 70 ± 26 mg/day and creatinine clear-
ance was 128 ± 34 ml/min/1.73m2 (Table 1).
Follow-up results are given in Table 2.
Serum creatinine was increased after donor nephrec-
tomy and remained higher than baseline values (P<0.001).
The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower
at all follow-up points of the study and eGFR loss at the
first year was 31% (P<0.001). Uric acid decreased early
after nephrectomy (P<0.01), but after that it increased
slightly and remained high throughout the study (P<0.001).
UPCR (g/g) was elevated after nephrectomy (P<0.01) and
remained high for the first 6 months and then returned to
baseline values at the first year (P>0.05).
Office SBP and DBP did not show a significant change
throughout the study. At the 15th day, SBP was minimally
elevated, but there was no statistical significance and the
SBP level was never elevated above the normal limits.
Office DBP showed an undulating course and returned to
baseline levels after 1 year. There was no difference from
baseline DBP (P>0.05).
uAGT/creatinine was increased about fourfold imme-
diately after nephrectomy (P<0.01). The increase contin-
ued until month 6 (P<0.01) and then showed a slightly
decrease at month 12, but was still fivefold higher than
baseline (P<0.05).
uAGT/protein was higher than baseline values and
showed a similar trend to uAGT/creatinine. It was highest
at month 6 (P<0.001) and showed a mild decrease at year
1 (P<0.01).
Baseline kidney volume was 122 cm3/m2 and after
nephrectomy kidney volume was increased 29 cm3/m2
(23%) at month 6 and 47 cm3/m2 (39%) at year 1 (P<0.001).
Markers of kidney function such as creatinine or eGFR
had no relationship with AGT excretion. Neither uAGT/
creatinine nor uAGT/protein showed a correlation with
other study parameters (P>0.05). The only statistically sig-
nificant correlation was found between uAGT/creatinine
at month 6 and UPCR at year 1 (r=0.639, P=0.008).
Kidney volume changes and also both SBP and DBP had
no correlation with AGT excretion.
Mixed effects models were used to evaluate the associ-
ations, if any, between changes in uAGT/creatinine and
other study parameters over time also after kidney dona-
tion. In living kidney donors, increased uAGT/creatinine
levels did not demonstrate any association with the change
seen in all parameters assessed in this study during 1-year
follow-up.
Discussion
This study showed that uAGT excretion increases after
nephrectomy in healthy living donors. Although it tends to
decrease after 6 months, it remains high at year 1.
Proteinuria increases after nephrectomy, but returns to
baseline values at the first year.
eGFR decreased 31% after nephrectomy in our study and
this result is consistent with previous studies.After 11 years'
follow-up eGFR loss was 30% and no patient developed
ESRD. Mean age was similar with our study.16 Another
study with 6 months'follow-up showed similar GFR loss in
donors.17 ESRD risk seems lower in kidney donors, but
some studies report increased ESRD risk especially in
African American donors.2 Kidney donors show similar
characteristics after nephrectomy. At 1 month postopera-
tively renal function stabilises and no significant change
develops at 1 year follow-up.18 Long-term follow-up results
show that unless additional risk factors such as diabetes,
obesity and proteinuria develop, there is no increase in

ESRD risk in the kidney donor population. A meta-analysis
also confirmed that kidney donors have the same risk for
developing ESRD as age-matched controls at long-term
follow-up.19
ESRD is an important and minatory endpoint after kidney
donation, but clinicians have still not defined the cardiac
effects of reduced GFR in otherwise healthy people. A con-
trolled study showed an increase in left ventricular mass and
a decrease in aortic distensibility in donors after nephrec-
tomy. Therefore, in the long term low GFR due to nephrec-
tomy may be a cardiovascular risk factor for kidney donors.20
In our study, we observed that uric acid levels decreased
in the early postnephrectomy period. After the first month,
it showed an increase and remained high during the study
period compared to baseline values, but no donor devel-
oped overt hyperuricemia. This can be explained by hyper-
filtration after nephrectomy and low eGFR may responsible
for the increase in uric acid levels at follow-up. Controlled
studies demonstrate that kidney donors have higher uric
acid levels than controls.21 A causal relationship between
hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease is still not clear;
our study suggests that the kidney responds with hyperfil-
tration to an abrupt fall in eGFR (nephrectomy) and donors
did not develop elevation of uric acid at this time, but
thereafter with the continuous low eGFR levels uric acid
levels remained stable and higher than baseline levels.
Many studies on proteinuria after nephrectomy have
been reported. A controlled study of living kidney donors
demonstrated that the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and
total protein excretion rate were similar.21 Proteinuria
remains below 1 g/day in most donors in the long term.2 A
40-year follow-up study showed that only 6.2% of donors
developed proteinuria and the risk factors were male gen-
der and higher body mass index.3
The compensatory increase in renal volume after
nephrectomy ranged from 22% to 30% and our results
were similar. Long-term follow-up studies showed that
hypertrophy developed less in the elderly and body mass
was associated with kidney volume and eGFR.22,23
In rats, Ang II infusion after nephrectomy causes an
increase in renal vascular reactivity. Joly et al. demon-
strated that vasodilator prostaglandins decreased the con-
strictor effect of Ang II, but after nephrectomy this effect
was diminished.24 In humans, the response of the remain-
ing kidney to Ang II was also changed after nephrectomy.
The expected changes such as increased GFR and renal
blood flow occurred and Ang II response was influenced
by the baseline reactivity of renal vessels. Lower GFR,
lower glomerular pressure and increased afferent arteriole
resistance was associated with a greater renal response to
Ang II infusion.5 These effects may be considered as a sys-
temic Ang II model, but the effect of the intrarenal RAS in
these responses has not yet been elucidated. There are as
yet no studies in humans about the effect of nephrectomy
on uAGT. uAGT is a marker of the intrarenal RAS and is
produced from the S3 segment of the proximal tubule then
released to the tubular lumen and excreted with urine. Ang
II, derived from the proximal tubule AGT, results in hyper-
tension as a consequence of increased tubular sodium and
water absorption.25 Gociman et al. showed increased water
intake and diuresis, immunostaining of AGT at proximal
tubule sections, a 30% increase in remnant kidney weight
and increased uAGT/kidney weight excretion in mice after
nephrectomy.26 While the vast majority of the glomerular
ultrafiltrate is absorbed in the proximal tubule, increased
expression of AGT in the proximal tubule may play an
important role in ensuring circulating volumetric balance.

without systemic RAS activation may trigger GFR uptake
before compensatory hypertrophy developed.
Zhang et al. found that uAGT was increased in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). As the
eGFR fall increases, uAGT excretion and type IV col-
lagen excretion was increased.27 The eGFR results of
our donors are compatible with stage II CKD. Animal
studies showed that Ang II infused mice exhibit
increased proinflammatory cytokine expression and
also increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis.28 In our study
the positive correlation between month 6 uAGT/creati-
nine and year 1 urinary protein/creatinine may be an
early sign of renal damage. An increase in uAGT ­ the
precursor of intrarenal Ang II ­ may be the leading find-
ing of future renal fibrosis.
The uAGT/protein level did not show a correlation with
other study parameters, but increased at the follow-up
when compared to baseline values and remained high over
the whole study. The study by Eriguchi et al.29 showed
AGT immunostaining in injured podocytes of rats and
intraglomerular AGT signals in patients with focal seg-
mental glomerulosclerosis. In the human study patients
with focal segmental sclerosis showed higher levels of
uAGT/protein than patients with minimal change dis-
ease.29 uAGT/protein may be a marker for podocyte dam-
age and affect the uAGT level. When the effect of
nephrectomy on glomerular haemodynamics is examined,
Lenihan et al. showed that increased renal plasma flow,
hyperperfusion and hypertrophy of the remaining glomer-
uli cause adaptive hyperfiltration without causing glomer-
ular hypertension.30 So there is no expected glomerular
damage, and the increase in AGT is not attributable to the
glomerulus. Increased uAGT may be the reason for hyper-
trophy of the remaining kidney.
Our study has several limitations. First, this is a pre-
liminary study, and a limited number of living donors were
examined after donor nephrectomy only for 1 year. Thus
the results obtained should be confirmed using a larger
cohort in the future with long-term follow-up. Second, glo-
merular haemodynamics and compensatory changes in the
remaining kidney were not evaluated in detail. Although it
is well known that the physiological function of the local
RAS in the kidney includes the regulation of blood pres-
sure, glomerular filtration, and reabsorption at the tubules,
the underlying mechanisms of compensatory changes after
nephrectomy are still not well defined. Despite the fact
that uAGT has been proposed as a good marker of intrare-
nal RAS in several reports, the long-term effects of local
RAS activation represented by increased uAGT levels in
the remaining kidney should be examined more closely in
future studies.
The increase of uAGT after nephrectomy in donors
may be a result of hyperfiltration and compensatory
hypertrophy or may be a sign of early renal injury with a
consequence of declining GFR. Ang II plays an important
role in the development of compensatory changes in the
remaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy, but it is
still unclear whether systemic or intrarenal RAS activa-
tion is more important. There may be other pathways such
as prostaglandins or paracrine/autocrine effects of Ang II.
Increasing the number of donors and prolongation of the
follow-up period may lead to the elucidation of the param-
eters associated with the increase in uAGT after nephrec-
tomy and a better assessment of the risk associated with
nephrectomy in renal donors.
