Background. Hip fracture in older adults is a significant medical, social, and economic concern to society. Little is
known regarding diabetes as a risk factor for hip fracture in the Mexican American population. The objective of this
study was to examine diabetes and other potential risk factors for hip fracture in a sample of community-dwelling, older,
Mexican American adults.
Methods. The study was a prospective cohort design involving the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemi-
ologic Study of the Elderly, a longitudinal study involving a weighted probability sample of Mexican American adults
(65 years) living in the southwestern United States. Included in the study were 3050 older Mexican American subjects
who were originally interviewed and tested at baseline and then followed with reassessment at 2, 5, and 7 years. Inci-
dence of hip fracture was examined for subjects over 7-year follow-up.
Results. At baseline, 690 subjects were identified with diabetes. One hundred and thirty-four subjects experienced a
first-time hip fracture during follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression revealed an increased hazard ratio for hip
fracture in subjects with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (hazard ratio  1.57, 95% confidence interval
[CI95
]  1.03, 2.39, p  .04) when adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, and previous stroke. The hazard ratio
for Mexican Americans taking insulin was 2.84 (CI95
 1.49, 5.43, p  .002) when adjusted for covariates.
Conclusions. We found diabetes was associated with increased risk for a hip fracture in older Mexican Americans,
particularly subjects taking insulin. Diabetes has not previously been considered a risk factor for hip fracture in older
adults. The high incidence of type 2 diabetes in the Mexican American population highlights the need for increased re-
search on risk factors in this ethnic group.
IP fracture is among the most common reasons for
hospitalization and disability among older Americans
(1­4). More than 300,000 adults in the United States experi-
ence a hip fracture each year (4). The incidence of hip frac-
tures world-wide is projected to increase by 250% in the
next 25 years (5). In addition to pain, disability, and mortal-
ity (6), hip fracture is significantly related to hospital costs
(7,8). Sloan and colleagues (9) reported a 167% increase in
Medicare payments for patients with hip fracture from 1994
through 1998. The cost of inpatient hospital care for persons
with hip fracture in the United States is more than $6 billon
per year and is expected to reach $16 billon by 2040 as the
population ages (10).
Risk factors for hip fracture include those related to falls
and decreased bone density. Previous research has identified
age, female gender, history of stroke, limitations in activities
of daily living, decreased mobility, smoking, and impaired vi-
sual function as risk factors (1,3,6,7). Other variables associ-
ated with a lower risk of hip fracture include later age at
menopause for women, use of thaizide, increased body mass
index, and greater than average height and muscle strength
(1,3­7). Some regional and ethnic variations have been re-
ported, with higher rates of hip fracture in the southeastern
United States and for non-Hispanic white women (11).
The prognosis for older adults who experience a hip frac-
ture is not positive (3). Twenty percent die in the year fol-
lowing hip fracture, and 25% of those who survive require a
higher level of long-term care (3). Those persons who do re-
turn to the community after a hip fracture have greater diffi-
culty with activities of daily living, and only 60% will re-
cover their prefracture walking ability by 6 months (6­9).
Consequently, there is a need to improve health and func-
tional outcomes for this population. An important step in
understanding and improving functional outcomes is being
able to identify and adjust for baseline characteristics that
influence morbidity and functional loss. This is particularly
true for minority and disadvantaged populations, where lit-
tle research on outcomes has been conducted. In particular,
we were interested in outcomes related to hip fracture in
Mexican American older adults. Our interest in studying
this population was based on the following factors: (i) the
incidence of type 2 diabetes in this population is known to
be high (12,13); (ii) recent studies in non-Hispanic whites
have suggested that diabetes might be a risk factor for hip
fracture in some older adults (13); and (iii) we had access to
a large population-based sample of Mexican American
older adults that included comprehensive longitudinal data
on health status and outcome (12).

DIABETES AS A RISK FACTOR FOR HIP FRACTURE M649
Diabetes mellitus has not been considered a significant
risk factor for hip fracture in older adults (13). Researchers
have reported inconsistent findings regarding bone density
in persons with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes in comparison
to control subjects (14), and few studies have examined the
possible relation between diabetes and clinical outcomes of
decreased bone density (15,16). Two recent large-sample
cohort studies reported diabetes as a risk factor for fractures,
including hip facture, in older women (13,17). These studies
were limited to non-Hispanic white women, and the base-
line response rate to the survey questionnaire in one of the
studies was low (42%).
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the Hispanic popu-
lation is high (12), and information regarding risk factors
for hip fracture in the Hispanic population is limited. Espino
and colleagues (18) examined the prevalence, incidence,
and risk factors for hip fracture in community-dwelling,
Mexican American older adults. They reported rates of 9.1
fractures per 1000 person-years for Mexican American
women and 4.8 per 1000 person-years for Mexican Ameri-
can men. The hip fracture rates for the general population
are 12.8 hip fractures per 1000 person-years for women and
approximately 6.0 per 1000 person-years for men (19). Risk
factors identified by Espino and colleagues (18) included
age, female gender, living alone, previous stroke, and limi-
tations in activities of daily living. Diabetes was not exam-
ined as an independent risk factor in this investigation.
Given the prevalence of diabetes in the Hispanic popula-
tion and the lack of previous research examining hip frac-
ture in this ethnic group, we conducted a study examining
whether diabetes was a risk factor for hip fracture in a large
area probability sample of Mexican American older adults.
Specifically, we examined whether diabetes was a risk fac-
tor for hip fracture after controlling for age, gender, body
mass index (BMI), ever smoked, previous stroke, lower ex-
tremity functional ability, and distance vision.
METHODS
Sample
Data are from the Hispanic Established Population for the
Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE) (20). The
H-EPESE is an ongoing National Institute on Aging funded
community-based study of 3050 older Mexican Americans.
Mexican American subjects aged 65 and older were selected
by area probability sampling techniques that involved selec-
tion of counties, census tracts, and households. A full descrip-
tion of the rationale, methods, and subject characteristics can
be found elsewhere (12,20). The sample was designed to be
representative of approximately 500,000 older Mexican
Americans living in five southwestern states--Texas, Cali-
fornia, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The present
study includes 2884 subjects at baseline (690 people with dia-
betes and 2194 people who did not have diabetes--see de-
tailed description below). Follow-up interviews were con-
ducted 2 (n  2439), 5 (n  1979), and 7 years (n  1686)
after baseline assessment. All interviews were done in the
subject's home and were conducted in either Spanish or En-
glish. A description of the interview protocol is available in
previous publications (12,20) and from the authors.
Diabetes
History of diabetes was assessed at the baseline inter-
view. Subjects were asked if they ever had a physician diag-
nosis of diabetes. A total of 690 (23%) subjects reported a
definite diagnosis of diabetes, 155 (5%) reported a border-
line diagnosis of diabetes, and 2194 (72%) reported no his-
tory of diabetes. Subjects with a borderline diagnosis of dia-
betes were not included in the analysis. Subjects who
reported using any medication during the baseline inter-
view, including insulin, were requested to show the medi-
cation to the interviewer as a verification check. For the
690 subjects with a definite diagnosis of diabetes, 599
(87%) were taking medication for their diabetes, including
185 (27%) who were insulin-dependent.
Hip Fracture
Hip fracture was assessed over a 7-year follow-up period.
Subjects were asked if they had a physician diagnosis of hip
fracture since the last interview. At the 2-, 5-, and 7-year fol-
low-up assessment interviews, 42, 48, and 44 first-time hip
fractures were reported, respectively.
Covariates
Baseline sociodemographics included age and gender. In-
dicators of baseline health status were smoking history
(ever smoked or nonsmoker), BMI (computed as weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), history
of stroke (yes or no), a summary performance measure of
lower body function, and a test of distant visual acuity. The
summary performance measure is comprised of three lower-
body activities, a timed 4-meter walk, rising from a chair
five times, and a hierarchical standing balance task (21,22).
Using previously established criteria (23), performance on
each lower body activity was classified on a scale ranging
from 0 to 4. When summed, the overall performance mea-
sure is scored from 0 to 12, where higher scores represent
better lower-body functioning (23). A modified Snellen test
using directional Es assessed distant visual acuity (24). Four
visual categories were created and included subjects
who were functionally blind (20/200), severely impaired
(20/60 to 20/200), moderately impaired (20/40 to 20/
60), and those with adequate vision (20/40).
Statistical Analyses
We examined demographic variables for all patients us-
ing descriptive and univariate statistics for continuous vari-
ables and contingency tables (chi-square) for categorical
variables. Chi-square analyses were used to test for differ-
ences between patients with diabetes (n  690) and patients
without diabetes (n  2194) at the baseline assessment in-
terview, and hip fracture (n  134) versus no hip fracture
(n  1443) at the follow-up assessment interviews. Cox
proportional hazard models (25) in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of hip
fracture over 7 years by diabetes status at baseline inter-
view, adjusting for relevant risk factors. We computed two
Cox proportional hazard models. Model 1 examined the re-
lationship between diabetes (definite diabetes vs absent) at
baseline and new-onset hip fracture (present vs absent) at
the three follow-up assessment interviews, adjusting for
M650 OTTENBACHER ET AL.
age, gender, smoking status, BMI, and history of stroke.
Model 2 examined the relationship between diabetes (defi-
nite diabetes vs absent) at baseline and new-onset hip frac-
ture at the three follow-up assessment interviews, adjusting
for the covariates described above, and a summary perfor-
mance measure of lower body function and a test for distant
vision. The two Cox proportional hazard models were rean-
alyzed using patients with diabetes who take insulin (defi-
nite diabetes and insulin-dependent vs absent) as a predictor
variable. Gender  diabetes and gender  insulin diabetes
interaction terms were created and were included in both
models.
A modified version of the Bonferroni correction was used
to protect against type 1 errors in those cases where multiple
univariate hypotheses were evaluated (26). In cases where
univariate comparisons were made between unequal sam-
ples, a t test based on Levene's test that does not assume
equal variances was calculated (27).
RESULTS
The mean age of the sample at baseline was 71.8 years
(SD  5.7). The sample included 1671 (58%) women and
1213 (42%) men. Six hundred and ninety subjects (23%) re-
ported a definite diagnosis of diabetes at baseline, and 185
(27%) of these were taking insulin. Table 1 contains basic
sociodemographic characteristics for persons with and with-
out diabetes who had complete data for all variables in-
cluded in the analysis at baseline. Persons with diabetes at
baseline were younger (t  2.88, p  .004), had a greater
BMI (t  4.43, p  .0001, see Figure 1), and were more
likely to have had a stroke (2  8.10, p  .0001).
During the 7-year follow-up period, a total of 134 (5%)
subjects reported a first-time hip fracture. The characteris-
tics of persons reporting a hip fracture versus those report-
ing no hip fracture are presented in Table 2. The bivariate
analysis of persons with and without diabetes versus those
with and without hip fracture produced a statistically signif-
icant result (2  4.30, p  .03, df  1) indicating the pro-
portion of persons with hip fracture was higher in subjects
with diabetes (Figure 2). We also computed a bivariate anal-
ysis using only those subjects with diabetes and taking insu-
lin versus those without diabetes who experienced a hip
fracture (2  6.39, p  .01, df  1).
The results of the Cox proportional hazard analyses are
presented in Tables 3 and 4. The interaction term (gender 
diabetes) was not statistically significant in any of the mod-
els. Table 3 includes the proportional hazard results ad-
justed for age, gender, BMI, ever smoked, and previous
stroke (Model 1), lower extremity functional ability, and
distance vision (Model 2). Table 4 includes results for the
same two Cox proportional hazard models except that the
models include persons taking insulin rather that those only
reporting a diagnosis of diabetes. The results reveal in-
creased hazard ratios for hip fracture in persons with diabe-
tes who are on insulin (HR  2.84, 95% confidence interval
[CI95
]  1.49, 5.43, p  .002) after adjusting for age, gen-
der, BMI, ever smoked, and previous stroke. The hazard ra-
tios remained statistically significant when potential explan-
atory variables such as lower extremity functional ability
and distance vision were added to the models.
As with any longitudinal study, there were missing values
for some variables. For Table 3, 18 subjects who had a hip frac-
ture had missing data in Model 1, and an additional six subjects
had missing data in Model 2. In Table 4, 37 subjects who had a
hip fracture had missing data in Model 1, and an additional six
subjects who had a hip fracture had missing data in Model 2.
For all variables except BMI, the proportion of missing data
was evenly distributed across the diabetic and nondiabetic
groups. Of the subjects with diabetes, 12.9% were missing
BMI data, and 8.2% of the subjects without diabetes were

missing BMI information. We compared subjects with missing
and nonmissing BMI values on selected baseline characteris-
tics. No statistically significant differences were observed for
gender (p  .49), marital status (p  .42), or education (p

and were more likely to be diabetic (p  .001).
DISCUSSION
Information on incidence and prevalence of hip fracture
has been obtained primarily from the non-Hispanic white
population (28) and indicates the lifetime risk of hip frac-
ture is about 18% in women and 6% in men (4). Hip frac-
tures increase substantially with age: By 90 years, one-third
of women and one-sixth of men will experience a hip frac-
ture (29,30).
Diabetes has not been considered a risk factor for hip
fracture in older adults until recently (13). Adult-onset dia-
betes is generally associated with being overweight, and the
protective effect of obesity against osteoporosis is presumed
to reduce the risk of hip fracture (5,8). Multiple studies have
demonstrated the relationship between low bone mass and
increased fracture risk, mainly in the non-Hispanic white
population (1­3). Previous research, again in the non-His-
panic white population, has reported relatively normal bone
mass in persons with type 2 diabetes (15,16).
We found increased risk of hip fracture in older Mexican
Americans with self-reported diabetes when compared to
hip fracture rates in Mexican American subjects without di-
abetes. The hazard ratio for experiencing a hip fracture for
Mexican Americans taking insulin was particularly high

(HR  2.84, CI95
 1.49, 3.43, p  .002) even when we
controlled for factors normally associated with increased (or
decreased) risk of hip fracture. These factors included age,
gender, BMI, previous history of smoking, and previous
stroke. The relationship remained statistically significant
when possible explanatory variables were added to the
models including summary lower extremity function and
distance vision scores.
Why did the older Mexican Americans with diabetes have
more hip fractures than subjects without diabetes? Many fac-
tors associated with diabetes could lead to an increase in falls
and associated fractures. These include visual impairment
related to diabetic retinopathy, diminished proprioception in
the lower extremities, poor balance, and unsteady gait
caused by diabetic neuropathy and/or peripheral vascular
disease. Any combination of these factors might increase the
risk of falls in older adults and subsequent hip fracture (31).
Type 1 diabetes has been associated with low bone den-
sity; however, most studies of type 2 diabetes have reported
normal bone mass (14,15). The importance of bone quality,
however, is relatively unexamined in type 2 diabetes. The
vascular changes associated with diabetes could, theoreti-
cally, have a negative impact on bone remodeling and,
therefore, on bone quality. The combination of poor bone
quality and frequent falls might increase the risk of fracture,
independent of bone mass (32).
Falling is a risk factor for hip fracture, and poor depth
perception has been reported as an independent risk factor
for lower extremity fractures (33). There is a logical link be-
tween diabetic retinopathy, poor depth perception, falls, and
fractures in persons with diabetes. Finally, failure to ade-
quately manage glucose and medication levels in older per-
sons taking insulin may also result in an increased risk of
falls and subsequent fracture. These are not all the potential
mediating mechanisms that link diabetes to increased risks
of falls and hip fracture in Mexican American older adults,
but they are areas where additional research is needed.
We consider these findings preliminary, but believe they
strongly suggest the need for additional research on diabetes
as a risk factor for hip fracture, with a particular need for in-
creased research on risk factors in the Hispanic population.
The importance of our findings is based on the following
strengths of the current investigation. We collected longitu-
dinal information from a large, well-defined sample repre-
sentative, at baseline, of 500,000 Mexican Americans in the
southwestern United States (12,20). The reliability and con-
sistency of the data collection procedures in the H-EPESE
investigation are well-established (12,18). Our sample in-
cluded both men and women, whereas most previous stud-
ies on risk factors for hip fracture have focused on non-His-
panic white women. The H-EPESE sample represents a
population (Mexican American) that is known to have a
high rate of diabetes and related complications (12,18), but
has not been comprehensively studied. Relatively little is
known regarding health disparities and risk factors associ-
ated with hip fracture in this population (18).
The limitations of the investigation include the fact that
several key variables including hip fracture and diabetes
were obtained by self-report. Previous researchers have re-
ported good validity for diabetes self-reports confirmed by
physician diagnosis (34,35). Individuals in this community-
dwelling sample should have good recall of a major health
event associated with hospitalization, such as a hip fracture.
Receiving a diagnosis of diabetes, however, is a less dra-
matic health event. As noted previously, if a subject re-
ported using insulin or other medications, the interviewer
requested the subject present those medications. Thus, there
was some interviewer verification of the diabetes diagnosis
for persons taking insulin or other diabetic medications. A
large number of the subjects with diabetes at baseline (87%)
reported taking some type of diabetic medication. Those
participants identified as not having diabetes probably in-
cluded some individuals with undiagnosed diabetes. This
misclassification would tend to weaken any association be-
tween diabetes and fracture.
Insulin use can be considered as a marker for disease se-
verity in subjects with diabetes. Duration of diabetes is also
a potential marker for disease severity and a risk factor for
hip fracture in this population. We did not have consistent
information on duration of diabetes for the subjects in the
H-EPESE sample, nor did we have any measure of glyce-
mic control for the participating subjects.
This study highlights the need for a more aggressive fo-
cus on identifying and addressing risk factors for hip frac-
ture in the Hispanic population. Our findings suggest that
diabetes may potentially be a more significant risk factor in
older Mexican Americans than in other ethnic or racial
groups. Research is needed concerning how diabetes and its
complications contribute to increased risk of hip fracture in
all populations, but specifically in Mexican Americans. The
results of this research must then be incorporated into diabe-
tes education and prevention programs, particularly those
