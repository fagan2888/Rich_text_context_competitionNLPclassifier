ABSTRACT
Recruitment and trafficking of autoreactive leucocytes
across the BNB (blood­nerve barrier) is an early patholog-
ical insult in GBS (Guillain-Barr´
e syndrome), an aggressive
autoimmune disorder of the PNS (peripheral nervous sys-
tem). Whereas the aetiology and pathogenesis of GBS re-
main unclear, pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF
(tumour necrosis factor ), are reported to be elevated
early in the course of GBS and may initiate nerve in-
jury by activating the BNB. Previously, we reported that
disrupting leucocyte trafficking in vivo therapeutically at-
tenuates the course of an established animal model of
GBS. Here, PNMECs (peripheral nerve microvascular en-
dothelial cells) that form the BNB were harvested from
rat sciatic nerves, immortalized by SV40 (simian virus 40)
large T antigen transduction and subsequently challenged
with TNF. Relative changes in CCL2 (chemokine ligand
2) and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) expres-
sion were determined. We report that TNF elicits marked
dose- and time-dependent increases in CCL2 and ICAM-1
mRNA and protein content and promotes secretion of func-
tional CCL2 from immortalized and primary PNMEC cultures.
TNF-mediated secretion of CCL2 promotes, in vitro, the
transendothelialmigrationofCCR2-expressingTHP-1mono-
cytes. Increased CCL2 and ICAM-1 expression in response to
TNF may facilitate recruitment and trafficking of autore-

INTRODUCTION
AIDP (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy),
the most prevalent North American and European variant of
GBS (Guillain-Barr´
e syndrome), is an aggressively debilitating
autoimmune disorder that affects the PNS (peripheral ner-
vous system) and remains a leading cause of autoimmune
neuromuscular paralysis (Zhu et al., 1998). Although the ae-
tiology of GBS remains unknown, the pathogenesis of GBS
probably involves both humoral and cell-mediated immune
responses (Quarles and Weiss, 1999; Hartung et al., 2001;
Kiefer et al., 2001; Maurer et al., 2002; Ariga and Yu, 2005).
Enhanced cytokine-mediated recruitment and trafficking of
autoreactive leucocytes across the BNB (blood­nerve barrier)
is an established early pathological hallmark of GBS (Hartung
et al., 1995; Hughes and Cornblath, 2005) and EAN (exper-
imental autoimmune neuritis), a well-characterized animal
model that shares many pathological characteristics with
AIDP (Spies et al., 1995; Hahn, 1996; Sarkey et al., 2007).

Circulating autoreactive leucocytes may initially home to
peripheral nerves by a mechanism that involves enhanced
local gradients of chemokine expression (Zou et al., 1999;
Kieseier et al., 2000). At these sites, proinflammatory cy-
tokines, in particular TNF (tumour necrosis factor ), play
a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both GBS and EAN,
as recently reviewed by Lu and Zhu (Lu and Zhu, 2011). An
increased presence of TNF has been detected within af-
fected peripheral nerves of GBS patients (Putzu et al., 2000).
Others have demonstrated a strong correlation between el-
evated plasma concentrations of TNF and clinical sever-
ity of GBS (Exley et al., 1994). Similarly, previous studies
have demonstrated an enhanced presence of TNF express-
ing macrophage infiltrates within nerve roots from rats with
EAN (Stoll et al., 1993). Therapeutically, neutralizing TNF
or its homotrimeric cell surface receptor TNFR1 has been
demonstrated to ameliorate the course of EAN (Stoll et al.,
1993; Bao et al., 2003). Similarly, TNF receptor knockout
mice exhibit an attenuated course of EAN (Mao et al., 2010).
Chemotactic cytokines and immunoglobulin-like CAMs
(cell adhesion molecules) are inflammatory mediators
that are highly involved in leucocyte trafficking and
transendothelial migration. In patients with GBS, dis-
ease severity correlates with enhanced expression of CCL2
(chemokine ligand 2) in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid), as well
as by epineurial and endoneurial vascular endothelial cells
(Orlikowski et al. 2003, Press et al. 2003). In EAN, marked
enhancement of CCL2 expression is reported to preclude the
onset of clinical deficits (Fujioka et al., 1999; Kieseier et al.,
2000). Antibody-mediated neutralization of CCL2 in vivo
ameliorates the course of EAN in rats (Zou et al., 1999).
By comparison, expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion
molecule 1), a CAM involved in the firm adhesion stage of
leucocyte migration, is elevated in the CSF and by sural nerve
endothelial cells in patients at the peak of GBS (Putzu et al.,
2000; Sainaghi et al., 2010). In animal studies, similar in-
creases in ICAM-1 mRNA and protein were detected in cauda
equina harvested from Lewis rats with EAN (Stoll et al., 1993;
Tran et al., 2010), and antibody-mediated neutralization of
ICAM-1 attenuates the course of EAN (Archelos et al., 1993).
The mechanism by which inflammatory mediators con-
tribute to peripheral nerve injury in GBS remains unclear.
Given that (i) there are clear phenotypic and functional dif-
ferences between vascular endothelium from different tis-
sues (Yosef et al., 2010) and that (ii) recruitment and traf-
ficking of leucocytes across the activated vascular endothelial
barriers is most probably governed by changes in the expres-
sion of specific inflammatory mediators unique to the local-
ized vascular bed (Springer, 1994; Harkness et al., 2003; Chui
and Dorovini-Zis, 2010), we chose in this study to focus on
TNF-mediated activation of MECs (microvascular endothe-
lial cells) harvested from the rat peripheral nerve. Although
advancements have been made towards the purification and
culture of MECs derived from peripheral nerve (Argall et al.,
1994; Sano et al., 2007; Yosef et al., 2010), no studies to date
have addressed how PNMEC (peripheral nerve microvascular
endothelial cell) cultures respond to a localized inflammatory
challenge such as that experienced during AIDP/EAN. To ad-
dress this concern, we harvested PNMECs from sciatic nerves
of na¨
ive Lewis rats and immortalized them by SV40 (simian
virus 40) large T antigen transduction.
Here, we report the stable immortalization of rat PN-
MEC cultures and demonstrate their retention of key pheno-
typic, morphologic and biochemical characteristics expected
of MECs from the endoneurium of rat peripheral nerve. Acti-
vation of primary or immortalized PNMEC cultures with TNF
elicited marked dose- and time-dependent changes in CCL2
and ICAM-1 expression and CCL2 release. Enhanced TNF-
mediated CCL2 secretion also facilitated chemotaxis of CCR2-
expressing human THP-1 monocytes in an in vitro migration
assay. We argue that increased CCL2 and ICAM-1 expression
in response to TNF may facilitate recruitment and traffick-
ing of autoreactive leucocytes across the BNB in autoimmune
disorders, including GBS. Collectively, these findings support
the application of PNMEC cultures as a novel in vitro resource
for the functional assessment of pathological alterations in
endoneurial homoeostasis during an inflammatory challenge,
such as that encountered during GBS/EAN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PNMEC
This study was conducted using protocols approved by the
Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee in accordance with the principles of labo-
ratory animal care. Primary cultures of MECs were prepared
from sciatic nerves of na¨
ive Lewis rats as described previously
(Argall et al., 1994; Sarkey et al., 2007). Briefly, harvested
sciatic nerves were desheathed to remove the epineurium,
perineurium and macrovascular endothelium. Remaining en-
doneurium was minced and digested with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin
and 0.25% (w/v) collagenase at 37C for 2 h. After incuba-
tion, cells were collected, filtered and sedimented at 700 g for
5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in Endo media [Ham's
F10 basal media (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) FBS (foetal bovine serum), 50 g/ml ECGS (endothelial
cell growth supplement; BD Biosciences), 0.4 g/ml heparin,
5.6 g/ml amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 unit/ml peni-
cillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies)] and
plated on a collagen-coated (6.0 g/cm2, rat tail collagen
type I, Millipore) tissue culture flask under an atmosphere
of 5% CO2
/95% air. Initial cultures consisted of a mixed
population of microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells,
perineurial epithelioid myofibroblasts and Schwann cells
(Yosef et al., 2010). Myofibroblasts were selectively elimi-
nated by Thy1.1 antibody-mediated complement-dependent
cell lysis (Argall et al., 1994). Cultures prepared in this manner

were 95+
-7.5% (n = 3) pure, 96+
-5% (n = 12; Trypan
Blue dye exclusion) viable (means +
- S.D.), and consistently
established contact-inhibited monolayers with a distinctive
cobblestone-like morphology. Primary PNMEC cultures were
restricted to six passages. Under these culture conditions,
proliferation of microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells
was optimal, whereas Schwann cells did not appreciably
proliferate (Argall et al., 1994).
A stably immortalized PNMEC cell line was produced from
purified rat primary PNMEC cultures using a replication-
deficient SV40 retrovirus encoding a temperature-sensitive,
non-SV40-origin binding mutant of the large T antigen
and a selectable neomycin resistance gene (gift from Dr.
P. Jat, University College of London, London, U.K.). Briefly,
semi-confluent primary PNMEC cultures were incubated for
36 h at 37C in the presence of 8 g/ml polybrene (Sigma-
Aldrich) with undiluted filtered viral supernatant collected
from SVU19.5 producer cells (Jat et al., 1986; Jat and Sharp,
1986). Selection was achieved by passage into Endo me-
dia containing 200 g/ml gentamycin (G418; Life Technolo-
gies). Antibiotic resistant clones were isolated by dilution
into 96-well plates at a theoretical density of 0.33 cells/well.
Several clones exhibiting phenotypic (contact-inhibition),
morphologic (cobblestone-like appearance) and biochemi-
cal [expression of vWF (von Willebrand Factor)/Factor VIII
and PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule
1)] properties characteristic of primary MECs were expanded,
and a single clone (clone 4.3) was arbitrarily selected for use
throughout this study. Immortalized PNMEC cultures were
maintained on collagen-coated flasks in Endo media at 37C
under an atmosphere of 5% CO2
/95% air.
For migration experiments, a CCR2 expressing human
acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1; a gift from Dr. E.
Kovacs, Loyola University Chicago) was maintained in RPMI
1640 containing 10% FBS, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml
streptomycin and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich).
TEER (transendothelial electrical resistance)
Immortalized PNMEC cultures (1×105 cells/insert) were pas-
saged onto collagen-coated Transwell® microporous (5.0 m
pore size, 0.33 cm2 growth area) inserts in 24-well tissue cul-
ture plates. TEER was measured with a DT92 Advanced Series
Digital Multimeter (World Precision Instruments) at 24 h in-
tervals after passaging. Collagen coated inserts without cul-
tured cells served as negative controls, and these resistance
values were subtracted from experimental resistance values.
Measurements were taken in triplicate for each insert and
averaged to ensure uniformity.
Immunocytochemistry
Semi-confluent rat primary or immortalized PNMEC cultures
grown on collagen-coated coverslips were fixed for 5 min
at 23C by immersion in phosphate-buffered (pH 7.4) 4%
PFA (paraformaldehyde), washed and blocked with 1% (v/v)
normal goat serum and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Coverslips
were incubated overnight (4C) in the presence of a 1:50
dilution of mouse anti-human Factor VIII/vWF (Dako) or a
1:50 dilution of rabbit anti-rat PECAM-1 (Serotec) mono-
clonal antibody. Washed coverslips were incubated with a
1:1000 dilution of either AlexaFluor488-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Life Technologies) or
FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc.), respectively. Cover-
slips were mounted onto slides using Fluoroshield con-
taining DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma-Aldrich)
and visualized with a Leica DMLB upright fluorescent micro-
scope. Images were captured using QCapture Pro software
(Q Imaging, Inc.).
Immunoblot analysis
PNMEC cultures were harvested by gentle scraping and
lysates were prepared in deionized water supplemented with
a commercial cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied
Science). Protein concentrations in cell lysates were quanti-
fied by the BCA method (ThermoScientific) using BSA as the
standard. Proteins in cell lysates were resolved by SDS/PAGE
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes as previously
described (Von Zee and Stubbs, 2011). Washed membranes
were blocked and incubated overnight at 4C in the presence
of primary antibody (1:10 dilution of mouse anti-rat large T
antigen (provided by Dr. P. Jat), 1:4000 dilution of rabbit
anti-rat CCL2 polyclonal, or 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-rat
ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (Serotec). Washed membranes
were incubated for 1 h at 23C in the presence of HRP
(horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(1:2500 dilution) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000 dilution)
secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunos-
tained proteins were visualized by ECL (enhanced chemi-
luminescence; ThermoScientific). To confirm equal protein
loading, immunoblots were separately incubated overnight
at 4C in the presence of a 1:10000 dilution of rabbit anti-
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) poly-
clonal antibody (Trevigen) followed by washing, incubation
with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000 dilution)
secondary antibody and ECL detection.
Real-time RT­PCR (reverse transcription­PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from rat primary and immortalized
PNMEC cultures with TRIzol reagent, and 5 g was reverse-
transcribed using Super Script III First Strand Synthesis Sys-
tem (Life Technologies) as previously described (Von Zee
et al., 2009). CCL2, ICAM-1, and tight junction associated
specific cDNA sequences were amplified by real-time PCR on
a Mini-Opticon PCR detection system using iQ SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad) with the rat-specific primer pairs listed
in Table 1. For each sample, GAPDH (Table 1) was used as
a reference control. Optimized amplification steps of 94C
for 5 min; 94C for 15 s, annealing at 55­60C for 30 s,

expression of GAPDH was unaltered by TNF treatment. Rel-
ative fold-changes in CCL2 and ICAM-1 mRNA content in
each sample were therefore normalized to expressed levels
of GAPDH.

Relative changes in intracellular CCL2 or ICAM-1 protein con-
tent were quantified using a cell-based ELISA. Briefly, con-
fluent rat primary or immortalized PNMECs were cultured on
collagen-coated 96-well plates and fixed with phosphate-
buffered (pH 7.4) 4% PFA for 10 min at 23C. Fixed cells
were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and blocked
for 1 h at 23C with 1% (w/v) BSA. Fixed PNMEC cultures
were incubated overnight at 4C in the presence of either a

TNF enhances CCL2 and ICAM-1 in PNMEC cultures
or a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-rat ICAM-1 monoclonal
antibody (Serotec). Immunostained cells were washed and
incubated for 1 h at 23C in the presence of a 1:5000 dilu-
tion of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), respectively.
Colour development was initiated with SigmaFast OPD sub-
strate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 23C, and stopped with
3 M HCl. Samples were read at 492 nm. Non-specific binding
(secondary only control) was subtracted and data reported
as percentage increase over quiescent vehicle-treated cells.
The content of CCL2 released from treated PNMEC cul-
tures was determined using a commercially available ELISA
kit (ThermoScientific). The working range for this rat-specific
CCL2 ELISA kit is 38­1500 pg/ml. Briefly, PNMECs were cul-
tured at a density of 2×105 cells per well (24-well collagen-
coated) and media from treated cultures were collected, clar-
ified by centrifugation (700g), and stored at - 80C until
use. Samples were diluted with Endo media (1:50 for primary
PNMEC cultures, 1:200 for immortalized PNMEC cultures),
and aliquots (50 l) were assayed according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. Samples were read at 450 nm with a
550 nm correction and results expressed as ng/ml of undi-
luted CCL2 released.
Transendothelial migration assay
PNMEC cultures were grown to confluency on Transwell®
microporous inserts as described above, creating a physio-
logical barrier separating upper and lower compartments.
An aliquot (1×105 cells) of CCR2-expressing human THP-
1 monocytes was added to the upper compartment, while
conditioned medium harvested from the separate vehicle-
or TNF-treated immortalized PNMEC cultures was simul-
taneously added to the bottom compartment. Vehicle- or
TNF-treated cultures were discarded after the collection of
conditioned media. After 4 h at 37C, cells that migrated
into the lower chamber were collected and counted using
a haemocytometer. To assess the specific role of CCL2 in
THP-1 cell chemotaxis, conditioned medium was pre-treated
(30 min, 37C) with a neutralizing polyclonal antibody di-
rected against rat CCL2 (5 g/ml; Serotec). As an additional
control, the neutralizing CCL2 antibody was denatured (95C,
10 min) in some experiments prior to addition to conditioned
medium.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean +
- SEM of n observations
unless noted otherwise. Statistical significance between two
groups was determined by unpaired Student's t-test. Sig-
nificance between multiple experimental groups was deter-
mined by one-way or two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni
or Dunnett's post-hoc analysis. In each case, P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Primary MECs were freshly harvested from rat sciatic nerve
using a modification of the procedure used by Argall et al.
(1994). Epithelioid myofibroblasts, the major cell contami-
nant (Yosef et al., 2010), were routinely eliminated from
prepared cultures by Thy 1.1 antibody-mediated comple-
ment-driven cell lysis (Argall et al., 1994). PNMEC cultures
purified in this manner were found to (i) be >95 +

tently establish contact-inhibited monolayers with a dis-

1 (CD31, Figure 1E), cell markers highly characteristic of
MECs. Cell viability of prepared primary cultures was typically
96 +
- 5% (n = 12), as routinely monitored by Trypan Blue dye
exclusion. SV40 large T antigen transduction of rat primary
PNMECs was found to yield stable immortalized clones that
uniquely retain these phenotypic and morphologic charac-
teristics of primary MECs (Figures 1B, 1D and 1F). Expression
of large T antigen was specific to immortalized clones, as pri-
mary PNMEC cultures did not express measurable quantities
of this protein (Figure 1G).
To confirm barrier formation and function in PNMEC cul-
tures, we measured TEER and determined expression of tight
junction-associated molecules. Twenty-four hours after pas-
saging immortalized cells onto collagen-coated Transwell in-
serts, TEER values did not significantly differ from negative
control (insert only) (Figure 2A). However, 48­72 h after pas-
saging, an increase (15 cm2) in TEER values was observed
across monolayers of immortalized PNMEC cultures (Fig-
ure 2A), in good agreement with previously reported TEER
values of endothelial cells that form the highly restrictive
blood­brain barrier (Davidson et al., 2009).
Both primary and immortalized PNMECs express measur-
able levels of tight junction associated molecules including
claudin-5, occludin, JAM1 (junctional adhesional molecule 1)
and ZO-1 (zona occludens 1), as qualitatively demonstrated
by RT-PCR (Figure 2B). In each case, the observed amplicon
size of amplified products agreed well with predicted values.
For comparison, we demonstrate that these molecules are
also measurably expressed in brain, where they are known to
participate in establishing tight junctions of the blood­brain
barrier (Brown et al., 2007).
TNF induces CCL2 mRNA and protein
expression
Confluent PNMEC cultures responded robustly to TNF treat-
ment by markedly increasing CCL2 mRNA. In primary PNMEC
cultures, TNF (10 ng/ml, 3 h) elicited a marked (>12-fold)
increase in the content of CCL2 mRNA compared with quies-
cent (media-treated) cells (Figure 3A). Immortalized PNMEC
cultures responded similarly to TNF stimulation, with both
a dose- (Figure 3B) and time- (Figure 3C) dependent increase
(>75-fold) in CCL2 mRNA content. In contrast, the content
of CCL2 mRNA in quiescent (media-treated) immortalized
PNMEC cultures was below the level of detection (Figure 3C).
Treating primary PNMEC cultures with TNF (10 ng/ml,
4 h) increased, by approximately 50%, the content of in-
tracellular CCL2 protein as measured by cell-based ELISA
(Figure 4A). Consistent with this observation was a robust
TNF (10 ng/ml, 4 h)-mediated increase of a 30 kDa protein
identified by immunoblot as CCL2 in lysates of treated im-
mortalized PNMEC cultures (Figure 4B). The higher molecular
mass isoform of this chemokine is in agreement with the pre-
vious reports of N-terminal glycosylation of CCL2 in rodents

TNF enhances CCL2 and ICAM-1 in PNMEC cultures
(Liu et al., 1996; Ruggiero et al., 2003). By comparison, the
content of CCL2 protein in lysates of quiescent (media-
treated) PNMEC cultures was below the detectable levels (Fig-
ure 4B). TNF elicited both dose- (Figure 4C) and time-
(Figure 4D) dependent increases in CCL2 protein content
in immortalized PNMEC cultures. No significant changes in
intracellular CCL2 protein content were observed over the
course of 24 h in media-treated immortalized PNMEC cul-
tures (Figure 4D), consistent with minimal constitutive ex-
pression of this chemokine.
TNF induces ICAM-1 mRNA and protein
expression
PNMEC cultures treated with TNF exhibited marked in-
creases in ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression (Figures 5
and 6). TNF (10 ng/ml, 3 h) elicited in primary PNMEC cul-
tures a modest but significant (>2-fold) increase in ICAM-1
mRNA content (Figure 5A). Immortalized PNMEC cultures
similarly responded to TNF treatment by up-regulating
ICAM-1 mRNA content nearly 10-fold in a manner that
was both dose- and time-dependent (Figures 5B and 5C). By
comparison, constitutive ICAM-1 mRNA expression was un-
changed in quiescent (media-treated) PNMEC cultures over
the course of the 6 h assay (Figure 5C).
Constitutive expression of ICAM-1 protein in quiescent
primary or immortalized PNMEC cultures was below the level
of detection (Figure 6). Primary PNMEC cultures treated with
TNF, however, exhibited a 50% increase in ICAM-1 pro-
tein content as quantified by cell-based ELISA (Figure 6A).
Lysates of TNF-treated immortalized PNMEC cultures con-
tained a marked increase in a 90 kDa protein identified by
immunoblot as ICAM-1 (Figure 6B). TNF elicited increases in
ICAM-1 protein content within immortalized PNMEC cultures
were dose- (Figure 6C) and time- (Figure 6D) dependent. By
comparison, constitutive ICAM-1 protein expression was un-
changed in quiescent (media-treated) PNMEC cultures over
the course of 24 h assayed (Figure 6D).
TNF promotes CCL2-mediated chemotaxis
In addition to inducing quantifiable increases in CCL2 mRNA
and protein expression, TNF significantly enhanced the re-
lease of CCL2 protein into the culture media from primary
and immortalized PNMEC cultures (Figure 7). The absolute
content of CCL2 protein constitutively secreted from quies-
cent (media-treated) PNMEC cultures was within detectable
limits (10­50 ng/ml), and was significantly enhanced by TNF
treatment (Figures 7A and 7B). TNF (10 ng/ml, 4 h) enhanced
CCL2 secretion >4-fold from primary PNMEC cultures (Fig-
ure 7A). By comparison, TNF treatment elicited a dose- (Fig-
ure 7B) and time- (Figure 7C) dependent effect on CCL2
release from immortalized PNMEC cultures.
The functional consequence of TNF-mediated enhance-
ment of CCL2 secretion was determined in vitro using CCR2-
expressing human THP-1 monocytes (Figure 8). Human CCR2

is reported to recognize rodent CCL2 (Sarafi et al., 1997). In
addition, CCR2-expressing human THP-1 cells respond to ro-
dent CCL2 (Neumark et al., 1999). Human THP-1 monocytes
have been used in in vitro assays with mouse or rat CCL2 as
a chemoattractant (Lynn et al., 2001; Matoba et al., 2010).
Chemotaxis of THP-1 monocytes through monolayers of qui-
escent immortalized PNMEC cultures in response to control
media was minimal (Figure 8). In contrast, addition of con-
ditioned media harvested from TNF (10 ng/ml, 4 h) treated
immortalized PNMEC cultures significantly promoted THP-1
monocyte chemotaxis (Figure 8A). The presence of a CCL2-
neutralizing antibody significantly attenuated THP-1
monocyte chemotaxis. Heat-denatured CCL2-neutralizing
antibody was, however, ineffective at preventing THP-1
monocyte chemotaxis in response to TNF-conditioned me-
dia (Figure 8B).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating sta-
ble SV40 large T antigen immortalization and partial charac-
terization of purified microvascular endoneurial endothelial
cells harvested from sciatic nerves of na¨
ive Lewis rats. Im-
mortalized PNMEC cultures are shown to retain key pheno-
typic, morphologic and biochemical properties highly char-
acteristic of primary microvascular endoneurial endothelial
cells. In addition to exhibiting contact-inhibited monolay-
ers with a cobblestone-like morphology and marked expres-
sion of endothelial cell and barrier markers, immortalized
PNMEC cultures responded robustly to a proinflammatory
cytokine (TNF) challenge by increasing the expression of
inflammatory mediators CCL2 and ICAM-1. The functional
consequence of a TNF challenge on localized up-regulation
of inflammatory mediators is underscored by a marked in-
crease in release of CCL2 from the activated peripheral nerve
microvascular endothelium. Here, we propose that increased
CCL2 and ICAM-1 expression in response to TNF may facil-
itate recruitment and trafficking of autoreactive leucocytes
across the BNB in autoimmune disorders, including GBS.
Advancements have been made towards the purification
and culture of MECs derived from peripheral nerve (Argall
et al., 1994; Sano et al., 2007; Yosef et al., 2010). Vascular
endothelial cell characteristics vary according to tissue ori-
gin and species (Bell and Weddell, 1984a, 1984b) and, to our
knowledge, no studies to date have addressed how PNMECs
respond to a localized inflammatory challenge such as that
experienced during GBS/EAN. In this study, viable cultures of
primary microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells from rat
sciatic nerve were routinely prepared at >95% purity. We
used a replication-deficient SV40 retrovirus encoding a tem-
perature sensitive non-SV40-origin binding mutant of the
large T antigen (Jat et al., 1986; Jat and Sharp, 1986; Green-
wood et al., 1996) to produce from these primary PNMEC cul-
tures a stably immortalized clone. Immortalized PNMECs were
found to retain key phenotypic (contact-inhibited monolay-
ers), morphologic (distinctive cobblestone-like appearance),
biochemical (localized expression of vascular endothelial cell
markers vWF/Factor VIII and PECAM-1) and barrier-related
(expression of tight junction associated molecules) charac-
teristics exhibited by primary rat PNMEC cultures. Immor-
talized PNMEC monolayers also exhibited increased TEER, an
established measure of barrier function.
Recruitment and extravasation of autoreactive leuco-
cytes into privileged tissue compartments, such as peripheral
nerves, is thought to initially involve establishment of local-
ized chemotactic cytokine gradients, including CCL2 (Yadav
et al., 2010). Consistent with this thesis, we observed a rapid
and marked increase in CCL2 mRNA and protein expression in

TNF enhances CCL2 and ICAM-1 in PNMEC cultures
PNMEC cultures responding to a TNF challenge. The phys-
iological concentration of TNF in plasma of patients with
GBS is reported to exceed 0.1 ng/ml (Reuben et al., 2002;
Radhakrishnan et al., 2004). At this low concentration, TNF
elicited measurable increases in CCL2 mRNA content in im-
mortalized PNMEC cultures. Higher concentrations of TNF
(10­100 fold) were found to elicit measurable changes in
both CCL2 mRNA and protein expression within PNMECs. Lo-
calized concentrations of TNF within peripheral nerves dur-
ing an immune challenge remain to be determined, and may
very well mimic or exceed concentrations used in this study.
In vascular endothelial cells, chemokines (including CCL2)
are reportedly stored in novel regulated secretory granules
that are distinct from vWF-containing Weibel-Palade bod-
ies (Knipe et al., 2010). Exposure of endothelial cells to an
inflammatory mediator elicits rapid translocation to the cell
surface of stored vesicles where they release their chemo-
tactic contents into the extracellular space (Oynebraten
et al., 2004, 2005; Deshmane et al., 2009; Knipe et al.,
2010). Consistent with these observations, primary and
immortalized PNMEC cultures used in this study simi-
larly responded to a TNF challenge by releasing into
the culture medium measurable quantities of functionally
active CCL2 protein. Antibody-mediated neutralization of
released CCL2 protein attenuated migration of CCR2-
expressing human THP-1 monocytes in an in vitro migration
assay. A modest, although statistically insignificant, increase
in migrated monocytes over baseline was observed with an-
tibody neutralization. This discrepancy may be attributed to
the presence of other C­C chemokines [MIP-1 (macrophage
inflammatory protein 1) and RANTES (regulated upon
activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted)] in the
TNF-conditioned media.
Responding leucocytes migrate through the endothelium
into peripheral nerves, in part, by a process that first in-
volves their engagement of temporally expressed endothe-
lial CAMs precipitating tethering, slow rolling, firm adhesion
and ultimate diapedesis (Springer, 1994; Raab et al., 2002).
Cytokine-mediated activation of the endothelium facilitates
migration of autoreactive leucocytes into peripheral nerves in
EAN (Stoll et al., 1993). Given that ICAM-1 is directly involved
in leucocyte trafficking (Greenwood et al., 2002), we deter-
mined the effects of a TNF challenge on eliciting changes in
ICAM-1 expression. Previous studies have reported constitu-
tive ICAM-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells (Rahman
and Fazal, 2009). However, endogenous expression of ICAM-
1 by primary and immortalized rat PNMEC cultures was be-
low the level of detection. Challenging immortalized PNMEC
cultures with TNF induced a dose- and time-dependent in-
crease in ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression, rendering
these cells capable of firm adhesion with autoreactive leuco-
cytes. Importantly, the effect of TNF on ICAM-1 expression
was similarly observed in primary PNMEC cultures, in strong
support of a physiological response rather than an artefact of
cell transformation. Compared with expression of CCL2, the
time course by which TNF elicited an increase in ICAM-1

expression was slightly delayed, reflecting differential tem-
poral dynamics consistent with their respective physiological
roles in leucocyte recruitment and extravasation (Springer,
1994; Raab et al., 2002).
The mechanism by which a TNF challenge elicits increases
in CCL2 and ICAM-1 mRNA content in PNMEC cultures may
involve NF-B (nuclear factor B)-dependent transcription of
the CCL2 and ICAM-1genes (Xing and Remick, 2007; Desh-
mane et al., 2009). Consistent with this thesis, TNF was
capable of inducing translocation of NF-B p65 to the nu-
cleus in immortalized PNMECs (results not shown). The precise
mechanisms by which TNF binding to its receptor leads to
an increase in NF-B activation remain unknown, but a role
for Rho GTPase activation in this process has been previously
suggested (Zhao and Pothoulakis, 2003; Williams et al., 2008).
Expression of CCL2 and ICAM-1 protein content by TNF
in PNMEC cultures may result from an increase in de
novo synthesis, reduced proteasomal-, autophagosomal- or

lysosomal-dependent degradation of existing protein or from
decreased release (exocytosis) of stored chemokine (Knipe
et al., 2010). While these various mechanisms have not yet
been elucidated in these PNMEC cultures, the observed rapid
increase in CCL2 protein release from TNF-challenged PN-
MEC cultures suggests, to us, that exocytosis of CCL2 is not
impaired in these cells. Additional studies are currently being
conducted to determine the mechanism by which TNF elicits
changes in CCL2 and ICAM-1 gene and protein expression.
In conclusion, we report the stable immortalization of rat
PNMECs, which retain key phenotypic, morphological, bio-
chemical characteristics and barrier-forming properties ex-
pected of primary microvascular endoneurial endothelium.
We demonstrate that TNF elicits robust increases in CCL2
and ICAM-1 mRNA and protein content, while significantly
promoting CCL2 release, in both primary and immortalized
PNMEC cultures. TNF-mediated enhancement of CCL2 se-
cretion facilitated migration of human THP-1 monocytes
in vitro. TNF facilitated alterations in other inflammatory
mediators in PNMEC cultures are anticipated and remain to
be established. Increased TEER, coupled with the expression of
tight junction associated molecules, represent unique char-
acteristics of specialized barrier-forming endothelial cells.
Collectively, these findings support the application of PN-
MEC cultures as a novel in vitro resource for the functional
assessment of pathological alterations in endoneurial ho-
moeostasis during an inflammatory challenge, such as that
encountered during GBS/EAN.
