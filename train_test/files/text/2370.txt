Objective: To obtain national estimates of the degree
to which school, police, and medical authorities are in-
volvedafterchildrenexperienceviolence,abuse,andcrime
victimizations.
Design: A cross-sectional, national telephone survey in-
volving a target sample of 4549 children and youth con-
ducted from January 1, 2008, through May 31, 2008.
Setting: Contiguous United States.
Participants: Children and adolescents aged 10 to 17
years and the parents of children aged 0 to 9 years.
Outcome Measures: Conventional crime, maltreat-
ment, abuse by peer and siblings, sexual abuse, and wit-
nessing and indirect exposure to violence.
Results: A total of 45.7% of children and adolescents
who had experienced violence in the past year had at least
1 of their victimization incidents known to school, po-
lice, or medical authorities. For serious victimizations,
such as sexual abuse by an adult, kidnapping, and gang
assaults, authorities knew about 70.1% or more of the
incidents. Awareness, however, was low for peer and sib-
ling victimizations, dating violence, and completed and
attempted rape. In general, school authorities knew about
victimizations more often (42.3%) than police (12.7%)
or medical authorities (1.8%). However, police were the
most likely to know about kidnapping, neglect, and sexual
abuse by any adult. Medical authorities were most likely
to know about sexual abuse by any adult, gang assault,
physical abuse by a caretaker, and assault with a weapon.
Conclusions: More incidents of victimization and abuse
appear to be known to authorities currently than was the
case in a comparable 1992 survey, but officials should im-
prove at identifying a large quantity of victimizations of
children and adolescents that appear to go undetected.

CHILDHOOD/ADOLESCENT
abuse is frequently de-
scribed as a hidden prob-
lem, and victimization
studies regularly have
shown that much abuse goes undis-
closed. The National Crime Victimiza-
tion Survey, one of the largest popula-
tion surveys, finds that violent crimes
against children are less likely to be dis-
closed to authorities than are adult crimes
and are particularly unlikely to be known
to the police.1 A study2 of childhood vic-
timization incidents in 1992 found that
only 25% of all incidents and only 6% of
the sexual assault and abuse episodes had
been disclosed to schools or police.
The hidden nature of childhood victim-
ization has multiple sources.3 Clearly, chil-
dren and adolescents are easily intimi-
dated by offenders and fear retaliation.
However, families, children, and adoles-
cents often wish to deal with crime and vic-
timization informally. They sometimes fear
the consequences of disclosure to authori-
ties in the form of interviews and police and
court involvement. In other cases, they do
not perceive the victimizations as some-
thingthatwouldbeofinteresttoauthorities.
One of the major public policy efforts
of the last generation has been to in-
crease the proportion of abuse and vic-
timization cases known to authorities. The
mandatory reporting statutes in the wake
of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treat-
ment Act of 1974 had this as a goal.4 The
message of virtually all education pro-
grams dealing with child maltreatment,
bullying, dating violence, and a host of
other problems has been to "tell some-
one and get help."5 In addition, criminal
justice and child protection agencies have
instituted various reforms to attempt to in-
crease confidence in those agencies on the
part of individuals who have experienced

disclosure.
Despite these policy initiatives, efforts to promote dis-
closure and track its patterns are unfortunately ham-
pered by limited research on this topic. Cited research
frequentlyreferstostudiescompleteddecadesagoorbased
on adult retrospective recollection. It is not clear that such
data reflect current experience after a generation of mo-
bilization and increased awareness about childhood vic-
timization in its many forms. The present study at-
tempts to remedy this problem by looking at the degree
to which authorities know about victimization in a con-
temporary cohort of children and adolescents.
METHODS
STUDY PARTICIPANTS
The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence, de-
signed to obtain 1-year and lifetime prevalence estimates of a
wide range of childhood/adolescent victimizations, was con-
ducted from January 1 through May 31, 2008, concerning the
experiences of a nationally representative sample of 4549 chil-
dren and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years living in the contigu-
ous United States. The interviews with parents, children, and
adolescents were conducted over the telephone by the employ-
ees of an experienced survey research firm.
Sample households were drawn from a nationwide sam-
pling frame of residential telephone numbers through random-
digit dialing. This nationally representative cross-section yielded
3053 of the 4549 completed interviews. To ensure that the study
included an adequate number of racial/ethnic minority and low-
income respondents for more accurate subgroup analyses, there
was also an oversampling of telephone exchanges that had high
concentrations of African American or Hispanic households or
those with low socioeconomic status. This second oversample
yielded 1496 of the completed interviews. Sample weights were
generated to correct for disproportionate sampling proce-
dures when combining the 2 samples. Additional information
on sampling methods and procedures is available elsewhere.6
PROCEDURE
A short interview was conducted with an adult caregiver in
each household to obtain family demographic information.
One child or adolescent was randomly selected from all eli-
gible living in a household by selecting the boy or girl with the
most recent birthday. If the selected individual was aged 10 to
17 years, the main telephone interview was conducted with
him or her. If the selected individual was younger than 10
years, the interview was conducted with the caregiver who "is
most familiar with the child's/adolescent's daily routine and
experiences."
Respondents were promised complete confidentiality and
were paid $20 each for their participation. The interviews, each
averaging 45 minutes in length, were conducted in English and
Spanish. Respondents who disclosed a situation involving se-
rious threat or ongoing victimization were recontacted by a clini-
cal member of the research team trained in telephone crisis coun-
seling, whose responsibility was to stay in contact with the
respondent until the situation was resolved or brought to the
attention of appropriate authorities. All procedures were au-
thorized by the institutional review board of the University of
New Hampshire.
OUTCOME MEASURES
Victimization
This survey used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victim-
ization Questionnaire (JVQ), an inventory of childhood vic-
timization.7-9 The JVQ obtains reports on 48 forms of youth vic-
timization covering 5 general areas of interest: conventional
crime, maltreatment, victimization by peers and siblings, sexual
victimization, and witnessing and indirect exposure to vio-
lence.10 Examples of individual items include robbery, assault
with a weapon, peer or sibling assault, neglect by a caregiver,
bullying, sexual assault (subdivided by perpetrator identity),
sexual harassment, living in an area with shooting or other vio-
lence, and witnessing family violence, among others. Specific
wording for all the JVQ victimization screeners is available
elsewhere.6
Follow-up questions for each victimization item gathered
additional information about each event, including whether it
occurred in the past year, perpetrator characteristics, weapon
use, injury, and whether the event was known to school or po-
lice authorities, among other characteristics. If injury re-
sulted, respondents were asked whether medical help was sought
(" . . . go to the hospital, a doctor's office, or some kind of health
clinic to get treated for this injury?"). Not all screeners in-
cluded the same follow-up questions.
This analysis examined victimizations that had occurred in
thepastyear.Specifictypeswereidentifiedandcountedin2ways.
First, each screener was treated as an individual type of victim-
ization based on its described characteristics. Victimizations were
flagged as known or not known to school, police, and/or medi-
cal authorities based on relevant follow-up questions.
Second, 2 aggregate types of victimization were identified.
In particular, assault with a weapon, assault with no weapon,
attempted assault, threatened assault, kidnapping, bias-
motivated attack, physical abuse, gang or group assault, peer
or sibling assault, nonsexual genital assault, and dating vio-
lence were each identified as a version of physical assault. Simi-
larly, sexual assault by a known adult, sexual assault by a non-
specified adult, sexual assault by a peer, completed or attempted
rape, sexual exposure/being flashed, and sexual harassment are
examples of sexual victimizations.
Victimization Characteristics
Specific instances of physical assault and sexual victimization
were further distinguished from one another using follow-up
questions and screener descriptions. Thus, physical assaults and
sexual victimizations were characterized as (1) causing no in-
jury, minor injury, or major injury; (2) having an adult or a
juvenile perpetrator; (3) having a male or female perpetrator;
(4) having a family, known or acquaintance, stranger, or un-
identified perpetrator; or (5) occurring at home, in a school or
day care setting, or elsewhere. They were also characterized by
how afraid and how badly the victim felt as a result of the event
(not at all, a little, or very).
Furthermore, physical assault incidents were differenti-
ated by whether the event involved a weapon, bias motiva-
tion, attempted assault only, or a threat only. Sexual victim-
izations were distinguished by whether no sexual penetration,
only attempted penetration, or completed penetration occurred.
Demographics
Child and household information was obtained in the initial
parent interview. Measurements included in the analysis were
the child's sex, age (5 groups), race/ethnicity (4 groups [white

non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, other non-Hispanic, and any
Hispanic]), and socioeconomic status based on income and pa-
rental educational level. Family structure was categorized into
4 groups: children living with (1) a pair of biological or adop-
tive parents, (2) a single biological parent plus partner (spouse
or nonspouse), (3) a single biological parent, and (4) other care-
giver. Place type was distinguished as (1) a city of at least 100 000
population, (2) a suburb of a city, (3) a town of less than 100 000
population, or (4) rural.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Study goals were to estimate the relative number of juvenile
victimizations that become known to authorities and to iden-
tify factors that appear to influence the likelihood of victim-
izations becoming known (with counts and statistical analy-
ses based on weighted data). First, the number of children within
the sample who had been victimized and whose individual vic-
timizations were known to school, police, or medical authori-
ties was counted. Follow-up questions that asked, "Do any of
these people know about what happened? A teacher, coun-
selor, or other adult at school or day care (Y/N); A police offi-
cer or some other law official (Y/N)," were used for this count.
Having one's victimizations known or unknown to medical au-
thorities was based on the follow-up question concerning seek-
ing medical attention for an injury, described previously. Only
screeners that involved physical violence included this fol-
low-up item, somewhat limiting information about the aware-
ness of medical authorities.
To look more closely at differences in victimizations and
characteristics that might affect whether they are known or not
known to authorities, we examined the physical assault and
sexual aggregated victimizations. For this analysis, victimiza-
tions were treated and counted as incidents, that is, as a single
event occurring at a single time and place regardless of the num-
ber of screeners that referred to the event. For example, a child
might be robbed and at the same time be physically assaulted
and/or threatened. This single event could be described by sev-
eral screeners (eg, robbery, assault with a weapon or with no
weapon, and having been threatened). Each screener in the JVQ
includes follow-up questions that allow those events that are
part of the same incident and those that are independent events
to be identified.
These follow-ups were used to identify all incidents that in-
cluded any physical assault or any sexual victimization, as pre-
viously identified. The separate physical assaults and sexual vic-
timizations were then described in terms of the victimization
characteristics (eg, injury, perpetrators, and place of occur-
rence) and linked to the demographic and household attributes
of the child or adolescent who had experienced the incident(s).
Direct logistic regression was used to identify the victim-
ization characteristics, child/adolescent characteristics, or house-
hold characteristics that were associated with incidents being
known to authorities. Four models were constructed that pre-
dicted (1) physical assault incidents known to school authori-
ties, (2) physical assault incidents known to police authori-
ties, and (3 and 4) sexual victimization incidents known to
school and police authorities, respectively. Incidents known to
medical authorities were not analyzed because of the limited
number of screeners reporting that information. Because a child
or adolescent might have more than 1 victimization incident
of each type, a dummy variable flagged those victimizations for
which individuals had experienced multiple incidents. In ad-
dition, the models included a measure of each individual's total
victimization experience--for physical assault models, the num-
ber of nonphysical assaults experienced in the past year, and
for sexual victimization models, the number of nonsexual
victimizations.
RESULTS
A considerable portion of children who had experienced
victimization had those incidents known by some author-
ity (school, police, or medical). A total of 58.3% of the
sample reported at least 1 direct victimization in the past
year (this included bullying but excluded events such as
witnessing domestic assault). Of these victims, 45.7% had
at least 1 victimization that was known to authorities.
The degree to which victimizations were known to au-
thorities varied according to victimization screener
(Table 1).Thevictimizationsmostlikelytobeknownwere
typically of a more serious nature, such as sexual abuse by
a known or nonspecified adult (69.0% and 76.1%), kid-
napping(73.5%),andgangorgroupassault(70.1%).How-
ever, even emotional bullying (51.5%), neglect (47.8%),
and theft (46.8%) were often known to authorities. The
types of episodes least likely to be known were peer and
sibling assault (16.9%), dating violence (15.2%), sexual ex-
posure/being flashed (16.6%), completed and attempted
rape (14.0%), and statutory rape (3.4%).
There was also considerable variation in the degree to
whichindirectvictimizationwasknowntoauthorities.Ob-
viously, murders to which children were exposed and pub-
lic offenses against schools were widely known. Also, wit-
nessing of domestic violence by children was known in
approximately half the episodes (48.9%).
School authorities tended to know about victimiza-
tion events (42.3%) more than police (12.7%) or medi-
cal authorities (1.8%). However, police were more likely
than school authorities to know about incidents for sev-
eral types of victimization, including kidnapping (71.1%
vs 46.0%), neglect (36.9% vs 29.2%), sexual abuse by a
known or nonspecific adult (64.9% vs 30.2% and 76.1%
vs 28.5%, respectively), and witnessing of domestic vio-
lence (42.3% vs 22.9%).
As noted, our information regarding events known to
medical authorities was limited. Although few episodes
involved medical authorities, the most common were
sexual abuse by a known or nonspecified adult (7.4% and
19.1%, respectively), gang assault (8.7%), physical abuse
(10.0%), and assault with a weapon (7.7%).
There was some variation by age in the degree to which
authorities knew about victimizations. For direct vic-
timizations, children and adolescents aged 6 years and
older were more likely to have their incidents known by
school authorities, but there was little difference be-
tween 6- to 9-year-olds, 10- to 13-year-olds, or 14- to 17-
year-olds for this factor. For police and medical authori-
ties, the victimizations of 14- to 17-year-olds were most
likely to be known.
As noted, 4 logistic regressions were used to identify
the features of children and adolescents and incidents
that were associated with being known to authorities.
We looked at physical assault and sexual victimization
incidents separately, as well as incidents known to
school or police, expecting the dynamics to differ for
the kinds of victimizations and authorities (Table 2
and Table 3).
School authorities were more likely to know about a
physical assault when it occurred in school, involved a

serious injury, involved a stranger or an adult perpetra-
tor, had a bias motivation, or made the individual who
experienced it report feeling afraid or bad (Table 2).
Attempts and threats were also more likely to be known
than actual assaults. Several child/adolescent character-
istics were also related to school authorities knowing
about physical assault victimizations: female sex,
younger than 13 years, having experienced other
assaults in the past year, and being from a family with
low socioeconomic status. By comparison, assaults
experienced by Hispanic individuals were less likely to
be known.
Sexual offenses were more likely to be known to school
authorities when they occurred in school, involved a non-
identified perpetrator, occurred to a 2- to 5-year-old or
a 6- to 9-year-old, and involved a child living with a step-
parent or unmarried partner of a parent (Table 3).
Police were more likely to know about physical
assaults when the offense occurred somewhere other
than home or school or involved a serious injury, a
nonfamily or adult perpetrator, or bias motivation or
when the child reported being very afraid (Table 2).
Also associated with greater police likelihood of know-
ing were when affected individuals were girls, from
families with lower socioeconomic status, and living in
a rural area. The only features associated with sexual
incidents being known to police were the child feeling
afraid and an adult perpetrator (marginal) (Table 3).

COMMENT
According to children, adolescents, and caregivers
interviewed in this study, the victimizations of many
children and adolescents are known to authorities.
Almost half (45.7%) of youth who had experienced at
least 1 incident of victimization within the past year
were known to school, police, or medical authorities.
This overstates somewhat the level of knowledge in
that some individuals experienced multiple victimiza-
tions and not all were disclosed. However, having 1
victimization known gives officials, with proper train-
ing, an opportunity to inquire about other victimiza-
tions. Moreover, the analysis also suggests that chil-
dren and adolescents with multiple victimizations were
among those most likely to have some events known by
authorities.
Many of the most serious victimizations, such as sexual
abuse by adults, kidnapping, and gang assault, were likely
to be known to authorities, whereas others, such as at-
tempted and completed rape and dating assault, were un-
likely to be known. The contrasting pattern for different
kinds of sexual crime may have to do with differences in
perpetrator characteristics; for example, attempted and
completed rape and dating assault often involve peer per-
petrators. Incidents with adult perpetrators are more likely
to be known, perhaps because the adult offenses are seen
as more criminal or because peer allegiances may in-
hibit reporting of younger perpetrators.
The idea that disclosure to authorities has increased
over time is suggested by comparison of the current
study findings with another national survey2 of victim-
ization published in 1994, using data from 1992. In the
1992 telephone survey with caretakers and children and
adolescents aged 10 to 16 years, only 25% of all victim-
izations were known to police or school authorities (vs
50.6% in the present study for that age group), only
29% of the kidnapping incidents (vs 73.3% in present
study), and only 6% of the sexual assault or sexual
abuse incidents (vs 11.2% in the present study). This is
good news and may reflect efforts by authorities and
advocates to promote disclosure. Because early disclo-
sure is believed to facilitate prevention, increased dis-
closure rates are consistent with the findings that child-
hood victimization rates have decreased considerably
since the early 1990s.13,14
Consistent with 2 other studies,2,15 our findings indi-
cate that school authorities are more likely to find out
about victimizations experienced by children and ado-
lescents than other authorities, which is understand-
able given how much time children and adolescents spend
in school and interact with school professionals. Al-
though police and medical authorities may conclude from
these results that they are seriously underinformed about
victimization, it is not clear how much victimization of
children and adolescents merits the specialized involve-
ment of those professionals.
The analysis also provides some clues about where to
reinforce efforts to promote disclosure, one of the main
avenues for authorities knowing about victimizations.
Boys are less likely to have their victimizations known
to authorities, probably reflecting the "boy code" of self-
sufficiency that stigmatizes help seeking, a code that some
educational programs are now trying to counteract.16 His-
panic children and adolescents are less likely to have their
victimizations known, perhaps reflecting Hispanic con-
cerns about how authorities will treat them. Children from
families with higher socioeconomic status are also less
likely to have their victimizations known, which per-
haps reflects suspicion among those families about the
negative effect of disclosure on children and adoles-
cents, combined with having the resources and status to
deflect the involvement of authorities. Efforts to empha-
size the helpful rather than stigmatizing features of pro-
fessional intervention might be useful to counteract some
of the concerns in these groups.
The study also shows that authorities are less likely
to know about victimizations involving family and peer
perpetrators in contrast to nonfamily and adult perpe-
trators. Educators have long recognized the need to
promote disclosures about such family and peer inci-
dents. An important task is for authorities to persuade
children and families that they have resources to help in
these situations and that they can provide protection
against retaliation for individuals who disclose their
victimizations.
Although this study has many virtues, including its
nationally representative sample and comprehensive spec-
trum of questions, it is important to be aware of some
limitations. The kinds of victimizations not known to au-
thorities might also be those that children, adolescents,
and caregivers would not disclose to the survey. Thus,
the survey may overstate the proportion of victimiza-
tions that become known to authorities. However, this
limitation applies to all surveys and was certainly as true
in earlier surveys as in this one. Therefore, the higher rates
of disclosure found in this study relative to earlier sur-
veys likely reflect real increases. Some might argue that
when children and adolescents become adults, they are
more willing to disclose, favoring adult retrospective in-
terviews as the best method for identifying unreported
abuse. However, adult retrospective interviews suffer from
the fact that adults likely do not remember all the vic-
timizations experienced during childhood and adoles-
cence, particularly those that happened at a younger age
and especially those that might have been less serious.
In general, victimology studies17 suggest that contempo-
raneous research is more complete and accurate.
The current study suggests progress and challenge in
the effort to identify children and adolescents who have
experienced abuse and victimization. The higher rates
of victimizations known to authorities found in the cur-
rent study may mean that past efforts to promote dis-
closure have been working and should be sustained.
However, the study also shows that a considerable por-
tion of childhood/adolescent exposure to victimization
is still unknown to authorities. The study suggests that
outreach needs to be particularly enhanced toward
boys, Hispanics, and higher-income groups. It also sug-

gests that disclosure promotion should be directed
toward episodes that involve family members and peer
perpetrators.
The promotion of disclosure also gains justification
as authorities develop interventions that are truly help-
ful in preventing future victimizations and treating the
negative effects of victimization on development. For-
tunately, more such interventions are being developed,
tested, and deemed effective, including conflict resolu-
tion programs,18 parenting education programs,19 and cog-
nitive behavioral treatments for victimization trauma.12,20-22
So, in addition to more education and awareness to en-
courage disclosure, communities should also ensure that
they have professionals trained in such evidence-based
programs to provide care to children, adolescents, and
families once victimization has been disclosed.
