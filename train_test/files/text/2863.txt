Abstract: This paper provides an empirical analysis of the impact of taxes other than
income taxes on both the level and the location of FDI using a large panel of German
multinationals. With regard to the level of FDI the results confirm an impact of the cost
of capital but also indicate some further significant adverse effects of sales taxes and taxes
on skilled labor. The analysis of location decisions reveals no significance of sales taxes
or taxes on skilled labor. Apart from corporate income taxes, location decisions are only
found to be affected by import duties, which exert a positive impact.

1 Introduction
Numerous studies have shown that international differences in the taxation of corporate
income exert an impact on location, investment, and financing decisions of corporations.
With the objective to maximize profits after taxes, companies, multinationals in particular,
engage in substantial tax-planning activities using their internal linkages in terms of inter-
mediates, factor flows, and finance. Tax planning activities by means of transfer-pricing
or intercompany loans have received much attention as they may be used to substantially
reduce the burden of corporate income taxes by shifting profits to countries which offer
favorable conditions. The corporations' search for favorable tax treatment has also led
governments to pursue strategic tax policies providing special tax schemes which can be
exploited for savings on corporate income taxes in order to attract multinationals' pro-
ductive activities. As a consequence, many corporations pay little income taxes and the
total revenue from corporate income taxes is typically only a small fraction of government
revenue. Thus, governments will be tempted to rely on other tax instruments in order
to raise fiscal revenue. However, it is often overlooked that the impact of tax policy on
corporate decisions is not necessarily confined to corporate income taxes. In fact, a re-
cent study by Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) documents that tax payments other than
income taxes such as general or specific sales taxes, import duties, property taxes, etc.,
are usually much larger than income taxes for US multinationals. Each of those taxes
will typically influence corporate decisions, and, again, it might be multinationals which
are most sensitive to those taxes as they are carrying out production and sales in several
countries. However, little is known about the consequences of taxes other than income
taxes on decisions of multinationals. Desai, Foley, Hines (2004) provide some evidence for
the case of U.S.multinationals pointing at a rather strong sensitivity of corporate decisions
to differences in indirect taxes Â­ roughly at the same degree as the sensitivity to differences
in income taxes.
This paper reconsiders the empirical evidence of the impact of taxes other than income
1
taxes on corporate decisions. The focus is on multinationals' investment and location
decisions where the impact of corporate income taxes is well established (for a survey
see deMooij and Ederveen, 2003). Given the heterogeneity between the various types of
potentially relevant taxes other than corporate income taxes the analysis uses a variety of
tax indicators capturing sales, property, and excise taxes, import duties as well as taxes
on skilled labor.
While most studies focus on the decision about the distribution of investment among
alternative locations, it is well recognized (e.g., Devereux and Griffith, 1998) that the
taxes might have different effects on location choice, i.e. decisions concerned with the
choice to carry out production activities in a specific country. Therefore, the analysis
below considers both investment and location decisions.
The empirical analysis employs a large panel of German multinationals. The German case
is of particular interest as this country usually follows the exemption principle of corporate
income taxation. This offers some interesting comparisons with the US case studied by
Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004), where the tax credit system might result in a relatively low
sensitivity to corporate income taxes. Thus, one might, a priori, expect that the German
case shows a stronger sensitivity to corporate income taxes as compared to other taxes.
With regard to the level of FDI the results confirm a strong impact of the cost of capital
but also indicate some further significant adverse effects of sales taxes and taxes on skilled
labor which are of similar magnitude as the effect of the cost of capital. Apart from
corporate income taxes, location decisions are only found to be affected by import duties,
which exert a positive impact.
The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides some theoretical background
on the determinants of investment and location. While we do not aim at deriving a com-
prehensive model of how both corporation and other taxes influence corporate decisions,
this background allows us to generate some empirically testable predictions about the po-
tential impact of various taxes. Based on this discussion, Section 3 develops the empirical
2
investigation approach. The data are described in Section 4. Section 5 presents the results.
Section 6 provides our conclusion.
2 Theoretical Background
Foreign direct investments activities of a multinational basically involve the location deci-
sion, e.g., the decision of where to locate production and the investment decision of how
much to invest into the production at a location. Following the standard theory of invest-
ment, the latter decision may be considered as a factor input decision. The corresponding
view here is that given output the firm adjusts its inputs in order to maximize the profits
at a given location subject to the substitution possibilities of production. In difference
to the traditional investment literature (e.g., Hassett and Hubbard, 2002), however, the
investment decision in the context of FDI is often interpreted more broadly in the sense
that the decision to adjust inputs is combined with the output decision (e.g., Grubert and
Mutti, 1991). Taxes in this more general view would affect the amount of capital invested
in the production by their impact on the choice of the input combination and the choice
of the output level of a subsidiary.
The location decision is somewhat more complex. Following the seminal contribution by
McFadden (1974), location decisions are usually considered as a choice among alterna-
tive locations based on the expected profits of an investment in each of these locations.
This comparison involves not only cost including tax payments but also sales and market
conditions for the company's product.
Investment as well as location decisions might be affected by various taxes. Some first,
useful classification might distinguish corporate income taxes, taxes on specific goods and
services used as inputs including property taxes and taxes on labor, import duties, and
general sales taxes. All of these taxes may affect investment and location in a variety of
ways, depending on the details of the tax, the production technologies as well as on the
3
market conditions under which the firm operates on its input and its output side. Given the
complexity of the tax effects it seems useful to derive testable predictions from somewhat
more structured theoretical considerations of corporate location and investment decisions.
Let us first consider the investment decision starting with a cost-function of company k's
production in country i
Ck,i
= C ( w
i
, v
i
, k,i
, q
i
, Yk,i
) ,
where w
i
, v
i
is the effective wage rate for unskilled and skilled personnel, respectively, k,i
measures the effective cost of capital, q
i
is the effective price of intermediate inputs, and
Yk,i
is the level of output. Following Devereux and Griffith (1998), w
i
, v
i
, and q
i
are defined
net of corporation taxes as the cost of those inputs are assumed to be fully deductible in
corporate income taxation. For instance, if the gross wage rate paid is wi
the argument in
the cost function is w
i
= (1 - i
) wi
, where i
is the statutory corporation tax rate. For
simplicity, we abstract from corporate debt and assume that all returns to capital are not
deductible in corporate income taxation. Taking account of tax depreciation the cost of
capital is defined as
k,i
 (rk,i
+ k
) (1 - di
i
) ,
where the double index to the discount rate rk,i
reflects the assumption that it is subject
to some common factors at the level of the company and at the level of the host country.
If the multinational has an internal capital market where one affiliate can borrow from
the other, the common factor at the level of the company might dominate the discount
rate such that rk,i
= rk
. If the capital markets were completely separated, the common
factor at the level of the country would dominate the discount rate rk,i
= ri
. Economic
depreciation k
is assumed to be equal across locations and di
i
denotes the tax savings
from the present value of depreciation allowances di
.
Capital demand is obtained from the derivative with respect to the cost of capital and will,
4
basically, depend on the same arguments as the cost function
Kk,i
= K ( w
i
, v
i
, k,i
, q
i
, Yk,i
) 
Ck,i
i,k
.
Making use of the homogeneity of degree zero in factor prices we can rewrite this expression
to obtain
Kk,i
= K ( wi
, vi
, ck,i
, qi
, Yk,i
) , (1)
where ck,i
denotes the standard user cost of capital
ck,i
 (rk,i
+ k
)
1 - di
i
1 - i
.
Following Devereux and Griffith (1998) the location decision will depend on the evaluation
of profits at possible locations j=1,...,n.
yk,i
= 1, if k,i
> k,j
, j = i, and yk,i
= 0 otherwise, (2)
where yk,i
= 0, 1 is a binary variable indicating whether or not the multinational holds an
affiliate at location i, and k,i
is the profit at location i in the view of firm k. Making use
of the unit homogeneity of the cost function in prices, the level of profits at location i is
determined by
k,i
= (1 - i
) [p (Yk,i
) Yk,i
- C ( wi
, vi
, ck,i
, qi
, Yk,i
)] . (3)
Note that the profit equation as well as the capital input equation (1) include the level
of output. Of course, the level of output is a choice variable of the company determined
in order to maximize profits. It is usually determined by the optimality condition that
5
marginal revenue equals marginal cost
p (Yk,i
) [1 - 1/ (Yk,i
)] -
C ( wi
, vi
, ck,i
, qi
, Yk,i
)
Yk,i
= 0, (4)
where  (Yk,i
) is the price elasticity of demand. The optimal level of output, hence, depends
on all of the input-prices determining marginal cost as well as on the demand conditions.
Note that corporate income taxes exert an impact on output only via their influence on
the cost of capital.
Equations (1) and (4) can be used to determine output and capital input and thus provides
a theoretical background for the analysis of the investment decision. Equation (3) defines
the profits. Evaluated at all possible locations together with equations (2) and (4) it can be
used to analyze the location decision. Let us discuss how these decisions may be affected
by taxes.
2.1 Taxes and FDI Levels
Conditioning on a positive location decision, equations (1) and (4) will allow us to deter-
mine the capital input at location i. We see that there are two ways in which the capital
input is potentially affected by taxes. The first relates to the substitution possibilities in
production the second relates to the output effects.
Corporate income taxation will increase the cost of capital relatively and, hence, will cause
a substitution away from capital. This effect is discussed and analyzed in the traditional
literature on investment which has emphasized that not only the tax rate but also de-
preciation allowances matter and that the tax burden will differ for different sources of
finance.
Taxes on goods and services used as inputs, in this setting might induce substitution effects
towards capital. However, this is, first of all, a matter of tax incidence. If the inputs or
6
services are inelastically supplied, changes in taxes would not affect the cost of production
and, thereby, would not affect investment or location decisions. But if taxes on goods
and services are not born by the suppliers of goods and services they might raise prices
and hence affect the cost of production which in turn will cause factor substitution within
the constraints of the production possibilities. Consider the case of a land tax. If land
is supplied inelastically one might expect that land owners will carry the full burden of
the tax such that the gross of tax price of land is unaffected by the tax. Then, taxes on
land would not affect investment. However, note that property taxes often tax not only
land but real estate including structures. Depending on the relative importance of the
latter those taxes might raise the cost of capital and cause substitution away from capital.
Another example is labor taxation. If labor is supplied inelastically, because workers do
not alter participation decisions or if workers are immobile, the burden of taxes on labor
would fall on workers. Gross wages would be unaffected by the tax. A different prediction
would be obtained under conditions of wage bargaining: if unions oppose to compensate
higher labor taxes with lower after-tax wages, tax increases might raise the cost of labor
and induce substitution towards capital. Taxes on labor would also affect the cost of
labor if workers are internationally mobile and demand a competitive after-tax income.
This might be relevant in the case of taxes on skilled labor. Due to the relatively large
international mobility of the skilled (OECD, 2002), companies might need to compensate
those employees for differences in personal income taxes and social security contributions
experienced across locations. These taxes, then, would potentially cause substitution effects
towards or against capital depending on the degree of capital-skill complementarity.
With regard to import duties we may note that for vertical FDI with important intermediate
input linkages between subsidiaries the consequences are similar to those of taxes on goods
and services. If the foreign subsidiary relies on imports of intermediate inputs, these taxes
would affect factor demand depending on the substitution possibilities.
For general sales taxes no effect is expected on the input decisions if business to business
transactions remain untaxed.
7
Taxes might, however, also exert a secondary impact on capital input as they affect the
output decision of the firm. Corporate income taxes as well as other taxes might raise the
cost and, therefore, lead to lower levels of output. This, in turn would exert an adverse
impact on capital demand. Of course, this also depends on the substitution possibilities.
Generally, the output effects will be strongest with fixed input coefficients where the pro-
ducer has little possibilities to avoid taxation such that the burden falls mainly on the
producer.
Taxes on goods and services used as inputs are expected to have similar effects on output
decisions. However, for those taxes the output effect works against possible substitution
effects such that the total impact on capital input is ambiguous. Thus, the impact of taxes
on labor could be positive, if production in countries with high labor cost tend to be more
capital intensive. For taxes on skilled labor, if one is willing to assume some degree of
capital-skill complementarity (see, for instance, Duffy, Papageorgiou, and Perez-Sebastian,
2004), a tax increase seems more likely to exert adverse effects on output.
For taxes on intermediate inputs such as import duties we should also expect some adverse
impact on output, because it is more costly to produce. With horizontal FDI, however,
the effects could be different. Here, import duties might represent the cost of entering a
market from abroad providing an incentive to raise production in the protected markets.
Since general sales taxes may affect output prices and market conditions the imposition
of those taxes might affect the marginal revenue in equation (4) and, hence, the output
decision of the firm. More specifically, we might expect general sales taxes or the value
added tax (VAT) to reduce the demand for the subsidiary's output and, hence, exert a
depressing impact on capital input. A further issue in this context is the existence of
the destination or origin principle in sales taxation. Whether general sales and valued
added taxes will affect location decisions also depends on whether the product of a foreign
subsidiary is sold in the foreign country or exported somewhere else. Under the destination
principle the output decision for production intended to be sold within the foreign country
8
(horizontal FDI) might be affected adversely, as the tax reduces the demand for the goods
and services provided and therefore exerts a downward impact on output. If it is intended
just to produce in a foreign country and then to export to other places (vertical FDI)
general sales taxes should not matter for output under the destination principle. One
might even argue that the effect for multinationals could also be positive as they have
some advantage against local producers.
2.2 Taxes and Location Choice
Location choice is affected by taxes if they affect the level of profits earned at a location.
Corporate income taxation exerts direct and indirect effects on profits. The direct effect
is simply the reduction of profits after taxes which make a location less attractive. The
indirect effect is related to the impact on the cost of capital. A reduction in depreciation
allowances, for instance, will tend to raise the unit cost and thereby further reduce the
profits of an investment project. Therefore, both the statutory as well as the marginal tax
rate on investment will affect location decisions. Provided the channels of finance and the
rate of profits are given, the effects may be combined using the effective average tax rate
put forward by Devereux and Griffith (1998).
As in the above analysis of taxes and FDI, taxes on goods and services used as inputs
will matter only if the tax burden is not shifted to suppliers. Thus, if taxes tend to raise
input prices, the cost may rise and the location probability declines. Even if land taxes
are completely born by land owners, property taxes might still exert an adverse impact on
location if the tax is also imposed on structures. Depending on the relative importance of
structures in the tax base, those taxes might also deter location decisions. Taxes on labor
would affect the cost of production and, thus, location decisions, if workers are mobile,
internationally, and demand a competitive after-tax income, or if other conditions allow
labor to shift the tax burden to the employer.
Location decisions will also be affected by general sales taxes. Let us assume, for simplicity,
9
that business to business transactions are untaxed (the VAT case), those taxes should not
affect the demand for capital given output. But if they reduce the marginal revenue
from output they will exert a depressing impact on output; the deterioration of demand
conditions will further contribute to a reduction in profits. Hence, they should have a
dampening effect on the location probability. Whether sales taxes will affect location
decisions is again further determined by the destination and origin principle. Under the
destination principle the location of production intended to be sold within the foreign
country (horizontal FDI) should be affected adversely, since the tax reduces the demand
for the goods and services provided and therefore exerts a downward impact on profits. If
it is intended to produce in a foreign country and then to export to other places (vertical
FDI), sales taxes should not matter for location decisions under the destination principle.
For vertical FDI with important intermediate input linkages between subsidiaries the con-
sequences of taxes on imports or import duties are similar to those of taxes on goods
and services. If the foreign subsidiary relies on imports of intermediate inputs, these taxes
would raise the cost of production and we would expect an adverse effect on location. With
horizontal FDI, however, the effects will be different. Here, import duties might represent
cost of serving a market from abroad. This points at an incentive to locate production in
the protected markets.
3 Investigation Approach
While the impact of corporate income taxes is explicitly taken into account, the impact
of other taxes is only implicit in the above specification of the investment and location
decisions. The above discussion clarified that additional assumptions are need in order to
identify tax effects. What kind of assumptions are useful, however, also depends on the
investigation approach taken. Therefore, let us postpone for a moment the issue of the
identification of tax effects and first consider the empirical approach to investment and
10
location decisions.
Following the capital demand equation (1) a first approach would be to relate the level of
capital of firm k in country i to its theoretical determinants. In the cross-sectional con-
text, in order to distinguish company effects, indexed with k, from country-level variables,
indexed with i, it is useful to evaluate this relationship using pooled cross-sections. A
linearized empirical specification is
log Kk,i,t
= 1
log wi,t
+ 2
log vi,t
+ 3
log qi,t
+ 4
i,t
+ 5
di,t
i,t
(5)
+ 6
log Yi,k,t
+ k
+ t
+ k,i,t
.
where k
is a company-specific fixed effect and t
is a fixed time effect. In order to control
for the heterogeneity among affiliates, one might further introduce industry effects at the
level of the affiliate. A problem with this specification is that it contains the output on
the right hand side. If we believe that variation in sales reflects changes in exogenous
demand conditions this is useful. However, as is depicted by the optimality condition for
the output (4) the output itself is chosen in the light of demand and cost conditions. Thus,
estimation based on (5) runs into difficulties due to simultaneity bias. This suggests to
employ a reduced form specification where output is dropped on the right hand side and
replaced by some general indicators of the market size, as for instance the log of GDP.
log Kk,i,t
= 1
log wi,t
+ 2
log vi,t
+ 3
log qi,t
+ 4
i,t
+ 5
di,t
i,t
(6)
+ 6
log GDPi,t
+ k
+ t
+ k,i,t
.
It is important to note, however, that the parameters in this specification differ from the
above specification since they capture the traditional factor demand as well as the output
effects of local conditions.
In comparison to the capital demand the modelling of location decision is more complex
as it involves the evaluation of expected profits across investment alternatives. In order
11
to estimate location probabilities most of the empirical literature on location decisions
employs some variant of the conditional logit model developed by McFadden (1974) (e.g.,
Bartik, 1985, Coughlin et al., 1992) which allows for some cross-sectional distribution of
the attractiveness of each location. Also Devereux and Griffith (1998) employ a nested
conditional logit specification which captures the relationship with other decisions reflect-
ing a firm's strategy towards the international markets. However, the conditional logit
approach is limited to the cross-sectional differences in the determinants of location and
conflicts with the observation that many companies, every second company in the dataset
used below, hold more than just one subsidiary abroad, the location of which are hardly
independent. Therefore, the analysis below follows Buettner and Ruf (2006) using a panel
data approach which proved useful in order to identify the effects of local characteristics
on location probability. More specifically, we study location decisions by estimating a lin-
earized equation for the propensity of firm k to hold an investment at i, which includes a
full set of firm-specific location effects i,k
, formally:
yk,i,t
= 1, if 
i,k,t
> 0, and yi,k,t
= 0 otherwise,

k,i,t
= 1
log wi,t
+ 2
log vi,t
+ 3
log qi,t
+ 4
i,t
+ 5
di,t
i,t
(7)
+ 6
log GDPi,t
+ k,i
+ t
+ k,i,t
.
where k,i,t
is an error term and t
is a fixed time effect.
Note that the propensity to invest at location i is modelled without specific reference to
the group of choice alternatives j = i. However, the firm-specific location effects will cap-
ture the cross-sectional distribution of the attractiveness of each location. The estimation
follows Chamberlain's (1984) fixed-effects logit estimator and models the probability of
observing an investment of the considered firm in a specific country in a given year condi-
tional on the observed frequency of corresponding investments in all years, i.e. conditional
on the value of n
t=1
yk,i,t
. Conditioning on this value removes the influence of the cross-
sectional differences in the attractiveness of each location without further distributional
12
assumptions.
While the impact of corporate taxes is explicitly taken into account, the impact of other
taxes is only implicit in the two estimation equations. Consider first the case of taxes on
goods and services used as inputs. Since the prices for inputs are defined as gross prices
they would include taxes and, provided the tax incidence is on the demand side, differences
in taxes would be reflected in differences in the gross prices. In order to identify tax effects
directly, we might replace the gross prices of a factor input by a measure of the tax burden
placed on this input. But, if not only taxes but also other country-specific conditions have
an impact on gross prices, estimation might suffer from omitted variable bias. A powerful
assumption, therefore, is that the net-of-tax prices of the inputs are equal across countries
due to trade or mobility. Thus, if qi,t
= 1 + q
i,t
qt
, we could replace log qi,t
in the two
estimation equations by the tax rate on the input q
i,t
in combination with the time-fixed
effect. The same approach might be taken in the case of skilled labor, where we would
need to assume that mobility is sufficient in order to ensure equal net-of-tax earnings for
skilled workers. This would allow us to replace log vi,t
by the tax rate on skilled labor h
i,t
,
again, in combination with the time-fixed effect. Import duties might be captured in the
same way as taxes on goods and services used as inputs assuming that net-of-tax import
prices are equal across countries. Note that in all the cases where identification relies on
trade and mobility it is useful to introduce some distance variable if no country fixed effects
are imposed. The conditions for the identification of the effects of general sales taxes are
somewhat more straighforward. So far, the estimation equations above only use GDP in
order to capture the market conditions in the host country. This might well be augmented
by an additional term capturing the tax burden on sales. However, whether or not an
impact of taxes can be identified empirically, also depends on the data available. We will
come back to this issue in the following data section.
13
4 Data
The empirical analysis employs a micro database for FDI provided by the German Bun-
desbank which includes a comprehensive annual database of foreign direct investment po-
sitions of German enterprizes held abroad. In its current version, firm-level panel data are
available for the period 1996 to 2003. The collection of the data is enforced by German
law, which determines reporting mandates for certain international activities. For further
description the interested reader might consult Buettner and Ruf (2006) and Lipponer
(2006). In the current study, we exclude FDI in the financial sector as well as investments
in holdings, since we are basically interested in the tax effects of the location of productive
capital. We also exclude firms which report zero investment or zero sales. Also branches
or partnerships are excluded. Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics on the size and
distribution of FDI stocks of German multinationals.
Tax data are taken from a variety of sources. Statutory tax rates for corporate taxation are
taken from Devereux, Griffith, and Klemm (2002). Another variable taken from this source
is the present value of depreciation allowances. A further variable related to corporate
income taxes is an indicator of whether a special tax credit is available for research and
development. The corresponding variable (R&D Tax Credits) is taken from a recent IBFD
survey and shows a value of unity in this case.
Sales Taxes & VAT, Excises, Import Duties, as well as Property Taxes are all taken from
revenue data and follow the usual OECD classification. The source is the OECD Revenue
Statistics and all of these variables are expressed as percentage of GDP. Sales Taxes &
VAT (OECD category: 5110) include all taxes levied on the production, leasing, transfer,
delivery or sales of goods and services. For this category it does not make any difference
whether the good or services are imported or produced domestically. Hence, it covers
value-added taxes, sales taxes and multi-stage cumulative taxes. Excises (OECD category:
5121) are all taxes on particular products other than general sales taxes and import or
export duties, respectively. This includes, in particular, taxes on energy sources. Import
14
Duties (OECD category: 5123) are customs and duties to imported products. Not included
are, however, general sales taxes or excises to imported goods (see above). Property Taxes
(OECD category: 4000) comprises taxes on the use, ownership or transfer of property. Not
included are, for example, taxes on capital gains from sales of property, or property taxes
taking into account personal circumstances of the taxpayer - these are classified as income
taxes. Of course, all these tax indicators capture only some potential determinants of input
cost, which may or may not show up in the gross prices, depending on the tax incidence.
Whether or not the empirical specification is able to detect the effects of these taxes
also hinges on the problem whether there are further conditions which cause international
differences in the input prices. For excises and import duties this may not be a big problem
if the former is mainly related to fuel prices and the latter refers to traded goods both of
which might show similar pre-tax prices across countries. The approach, however, might be
less convincing with regard to property taxes given the strong heterogeneity in the markets
for real estate.
With regard to labor taxes it seems particularly difficult to argue that gross wage differences
are only driven by differences in the tax burden. For instance, unions or unemployment
insurance might exert further important effects on the gross wages. Hence, with regard to
labor we do not attempt to identify the impact of labor taxes, and instead use a comprehen-
sive indicator of labor cost including gross wages as well as taxes on labor input at the level
of the employer. The corresponding labor cost data is taken from U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. It reports hourly compensation costs for production workers in manufacturing
including taxes paid by the employer and before taxes paid by the employee expressed in
U.S. Dollars. However, controlling for the average cost of labor, the analysis below tests for
an impact of taxes on skilled labor. Here, the assumption is that skilled labor may receive
rather similar remuneration after taxes. This is related to the much higher mobility of
the skilled, in particular, within multinational corporations (expatriates). Building on this
hypothesis, Elschner and Schwager (2005) develop an indicator of the effective average tax
rate for skilled labor. The measurement method is comparable to the OECD (1992) Taxing

Wages approach. The tax wedges are calculated by taking the difference between labor
cost to the employer and a uniform level of net income of the employee. In doing so, the
method combines the effects of personal income taxes, social security contributions and
family cash benefits on net incomes of employees. Figure 1 shows the values for several
EU countries plotted against the statutory corporation tax rate.
A final source of tax data used in the empirical analysis is more similar to Desai, Foley,
and Hines (2004). Using a large microdataset for companies (Worldscope) we calculated
indicators based on individual income and cost statements for companies which include the
amount of (corporate) income taxes and other taxes paid. While income taxes are scaled
with pre-tax profits, other taxes are scaled by the total amount of sales; a third indicator is
simply based on the ratio of other to income taxes. The resulting indicator in each case is
16
the median of the figures reported by all companies located in a country in the respective
year. As is depicted in Table 2 the data points at large differences across countries and
periods. The mean across countries and years confirms the finding of Desai, Foley, and
Hines (2004) that other taxes usually amount to larger figures than income taxes.
Apart from tax data, the analysis uses controls for GDP, distance, and the level of corrup-
tion in order to capture other potentially relevant determinants of investment and location.
As in Egger and Winner (2006) we use corruption perception data from Transparency In-
ternational. See appendix for further description.
5 Results
The empirical analysis is concerned with the determinants of the level of PPE invested by
a German parent company in a foreign subsidiary as well as with the underlying location
decision for a sample of 18 countries for which sufficient data on taxes and other relevant
local conditions is available over a period of 8 years (1996-2003). Consider first the de-
terminants of the stock of PPE following specification (6). Table 3 reports corresponding
results. In column (1) the impact of corporation taxes is captured by the statutory cor-
porate income tax rate and the present value of tax depreciation allowances, interacted
with the tax rate. While the signs match theoretical expectations, the statutory tax rate
is insignificant. GDP exerts the usual strong positive effect, and also the corruption index
confirms expectations indicating that investment is lower in countries with high levels of
(perceived) corruption. Specification (2) adds a dummy variable indicating the presence
of special tax privileges for R&D expenditures. This specification yields some significance
for the statutory tax rate and also for the presence of R&D tax credits. Remarkably, both
specifications support a positive impact of the local lending rate. This is somewhat puz-
zling at first sight, but we should note that multinationals may use intercompany loans in
order to circumvent adverse lending conditions in one country (Desai, Foley, and Hines,
17
2004b). One might speculate whether this gives multinationals an advantage against local
firms. Specification (3) to (7) report the results of estimations including various indirect
taxes. Sales taxes, but also excise taxes exert significant negative effects. Import duties
on the other hand exert positive effects. While the property tax rate proves insignificant,
joint estimation (7) supports adverse effects for property taxes as well as for Sales Taxes
& VAT. This last specification shows the best fit. In this specification, the relative size of
the two coefficients for the statutory tax rate and its interaction with the present value of
depreciation allowances conforms with the view that FDI is affected by corporate income
taxes via their impact on the cost of capital. In the light of the theory, the significance of
the sales taxes would indicate that horizontal FDI is important where the sales taxes exert
an adverse effect on demand conditions.
Let us briefly consider the magnitude of effects. Evaluated at the mean, the tax elasticity
of FDI with regard to the statutory corporation tax rate is at 0.83 which is larger than the
average figure of 0.6 found in the literature (cf., Hines, 1999). The elasticity with regard to
Sales Taxes & VAT taxes is at about 0.73. However, it should be noted that the tax variable
relates to revenue data and, therefore, combines the tax code with the activities of the tax
payers and the tax administration. This makes it difficult to compare the magnitudes.1
Nevertheless, the results support the result of Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) that indirect
taxes exert effects on FDI which are as strong as those of the corporation tax.
Table 4 reports results where, in addition, the tax burden on skilled labor is included. Note
that this variable is not available for the whole sample Â­ 5 countries had to be excluded
resulting in a considerable loss of variation in taxes. Nevertheless, the results support a
significant adverse effect of this tax rate. Again, the specification including all taxes shows
the best fit. It also confirms the adverse effects of sales taxes. While this specification no
longer supports an impact of property taxes, excise taxes now show a significant effect.
1As there are always difficulties to enforce the tax code and since agents typically adjust their activities
in order to avoid taxation we should expect that the use of revenue data underestimates the tax rate
elasticities.
18
Taken together, the results for the level of FDI support some adverse effects not only for
the corporate income taxes but also for sales and value added taxes. Further significance
is found for the taxation of skilled labor. The results for corporation income taxes are
consistent with the view that their impact is basically due to an increase in the cost of
capital. The strong result for the taxation of skilled labor points at some complementarity
between capital and skilled labor. The finding for the general sales taxes might be taken
to indicate an adverse impact of those taxes on the size of the market.
Tables 5 and 6 provide results for the location decision. While the tables display, basically,
the same set of determinants as in the case of the analysis of the FDI-level, it is important
to note that a fixed effects logit estimation is reported which removes the cross-sectional
differences in the locational attractiveness. This constraints our ability to detect significant
impacts of taxes, since the available variation is reduced. Nevertheless, the results support
a significant effect of all control variables (Distance and R&D Tax Credit are removed as
these variable shows only cross-sectional variation). Not only is the level of corruption
found to exert adverse effects on location probability, but also the local lending rate shows
significant effects. The latter result is remarkable as we know from the study of corporate
finance decisions of multinationals (Desai, Foley, Hines, 2004b) that multinationals have
some advantage against local firms due to the possible substitution of local debt by means
of intercompany loans.2 The positive coefficient suggests that this advantage might induce
multinationals to locate in countries with less favorable credit market conditions. Further-
more, we find an impact of the statutory corporation tax, while depreciation allowances
do not matter. Note that this is in some accordance with Devereux and Griffith (1998)
who argue that location decisions are not driven by the marginal tax rate but by some
combination of marginal and statutory tax rate. The finding is also in accordance with
Buettner and Ruf (2006) who find that the statutory tax rate has a stronger predictive
power for location decisions than effective tax rates. All other tax indicators prove insignif-
2A companion paper (Buettner, Overesch, Schreiber, Wamser, 2006) shows that the local lending rate
variable exerts similar effects on the corporate finance of the German multinationals considered and that
the variation in the lending rate is a sufficient statistic for the local credit market conditions.
19
icant, except for the import duties. This finding is consistent with the view that barriers
to trade induce multinationals to locate production in the protected countries.
As a final empirical exercise further estimations have been carried out using the income
and other tax variables generated from company accounts. While the results support some
adverse effect of income taxes in addition to the statutory corporate income tax rates,
other taxes failed to show a significant effect on both investment and location. However,
this might well be attributable to the rather strong variation of those tax measures within
countries together with a serious reduction in the samples size resulting from the lack of
data availability.
6 Conclusions
This paper has reconsidered the empirical evidence for an impact of taxes other than
corporate income taxes on the level and location of FDI of German multinationals. Based
on a standard theoretical framework of investment and location decisions, the paper started
with a discussion of the potential impact of various taxes on input allocation, output
as well as location decisions. The discussion emphasized the role of tax incidence for
the consequences of taxes other than corporate income taxes and the necessity of further
assumptions in order to identify tax effects empirically.
The panel data analysis of the level of capital invested in property, plant, and equipment
by German multinationals in 18 foreign OECD countries adds some support to the study of
Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) which found significant effects not only of direct but also of
indirect taxes for the case of US multinationals. More specifically, the results show a role of
corporate income taxes via the cost of capital and, in fact, indicate some further significant
adverse effects of sales taxes on the investment position. The magnitude of effects on the
level of capital invested is found to be comparable to those of the corporation tax. The
impact of sales taxes points at some adverse demand effects of those taxes. Another tax
20
variable which proves significant is the tax on skilled labor. The results point at a negative
impact of similar magnitude as that of the corporate income tax. This impact of taxes
on skilled labor conforms with theoretical predictions if we assume that this type of labor
is mobile internationally and if there is some capital-skill complementarity. Some further
significance of other tax variables is detected only in single specifications but proves not
to be robust across specifications.
In contrast to the analysis of the level of FDI, the analysis of location decisions reveals no
significance of taxes other than corporate income taxes. Location decisions are only found
to be affected by import duties, which, however, exert a positive impact. This is consistent
with the view that multinationals show a higher propensity to place production in markets
which are protected from imports.
We cannot preclude, however, that some of the other tax variables used in the investi-
gation failed to show significant effects not because they were irrelevant for location and
investment but because there are other important determinants of cost or output market
conditions which are not taken into account in the investigation approach. Nevertheless,
the results suggest that policies devoted to attract investments of multinationals already
present in their country should care for low cost of capital, low sales taxes, as well as low
taxation of skilled labor. Policies aiming at an attraction of subsidiaries of foreign multi-
nationals should reduce corporate income tax rates. Abolition of import duties, however,
might exert adverse effects on the location propensity.
