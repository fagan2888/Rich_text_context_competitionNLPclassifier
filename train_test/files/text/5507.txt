Research About Electronic Monitoring
and Privacy Concerns
Monitoring increased concerns about employee privacy;
therefore, employers must find a balance between monitor-
ing gains and the costs of invading employee privacy
(Jackson, Schuler, & Werner, 2009). However, the use of
emerging technologies in monitoring employee practices is
raising concerns that the privacy rights of employees are vul-
nerable, and it is becoming more challenging to balance
employer security rights with employee privacy issues
(Mathis & Jackson, 2000). Consequently, significant privacy
issues are being debated in business and government, for
example, (a) violation of privacy: examining and retrieving
private e-mails, records, and information about employees
from their access to particular Internet websites; (b) com-
puter monitoring: continually knowing where the employee
is; (c) computer matching: synthesizing information obtained
from different sources to enhance your marketing services;
and (d) unauthorized personnel files: gathering telephone
numbers, e-mail addresses, credit card numbers, and other
private information to develop customer profiles (O'Brien &
Marakas, 2006). Technological advancements enabled
employers to enhance employee productivity and put
employee privacy under siege. Robbins and Coulter (1999)
presented some perplexing questions, such as the following:
1. Is the e-mail system for business purposes only?
2. Is an employee allowed to e-mail work information
to a colleague along with some personal chatting?
3. What is the acceptable use of the system?
4. Who possesses the information that is produced from
the network?
Organizations regulate Internet use, or website visits by
their workforce, through two regular ways: by restricting
access to particular links, and by monitoring employee
actions (Alampay & Hechanova, 2010). In this study, it also
is revealed that monitoring policies and controlling websites
vary from one country to another; for example, China,
Vietnam, and Singapore not only block certain sites but also
proscribe access to political and linguistic affairs. Everett,
Wong, and Paynter (2006) found that a significant number of
subjects related to employee and employer rights should be
taken into consideration in further studies: (a) A significant
issue is concerned with building trust between employers
and employees in the workplace; another vital topic is linked

Monitoring Employee Behavior Through
the Use of Technology and Issues of
Employee Privacy in America
Mahmoud Moussa1
Abstract
Despite the historic American love for privacy that has enhanced innovation and creativity throughout the country,
encroachments on privacy restrain individual freedom. Noticeable, advances in technology have offered decision makers
remarkable monitoring aptitudes that can be used in numerous tasks for multiple reasons. This has led scholars and
practitioners to pose a significant number of questions about what is legitimate and illegitimate in the day-to-day affairs
of a business. This article is composed of (a) research about electronic monitoring and privacy concerns; (b) definitions
of, critiques of, and alternatives to electronic performance monitoring (EPM); (c) motives behind employee monitoring
and leadership behaviors; (d) advice that makes monitoring less distressful; (e) employee monitoring policies; (f) reviewing
policies and procedures; (g) the role of human resource development (HRD) in employee assessment and development; and
(h) conclusion and recommendations for further studies.

with the establishment of pertinent legislation that manages
privacy issues in workplace surveillance forthrightly; (b) a
thorny factor is the growing occurrence of satellite, commu-
nal facility, and work at home, which urge employers to
monitor their employees; (c) the diversification and capaci-
ties of the Internet for communication provide new topics for
research; (d) the possibility to proscribe all small electronic
devices in the workplace that could be used to e-mail firms'
secrets to an external beneficiary; and (e) enlarging the inter-
national comparison and probing the rising position of inter-
national standards and "harmonization agreements,"
concerning policies developed by the European Union and
the United Nations, as well as standards propagated by the
International Organization for Standardization, the national
defense agencies, and government branches of criminal
investigation.
Everett et al. (2006) referred to certain issues potentially
leading to greater employer use of the perception that such
monitoring is needed. For example, government efforts to
crush terrorism, assuage the proliferation of govern nuclear
weapons knowledge, hinder money laundering, and limit
drug traffickers, both unlawful and pharmaceutical. More
recently, employers have begun tracking their employees by
using global positioning system (GPS) technology, which
uses an assemblage of satellites to specify the precise loca-
tion of the GPS-enabled device. Therefore, Townsm and
Cobb (2012) recommended realistic steps when applying
GPS tracking as follows: incorporate GPS tracking with
other policies; preserve the right to monitor; do not create a
conclusive evidence with GPS tracking documents; limit the
use of GPS technology to monitor; rigorously outline appro-
priate use of company cell phones, vehicles, and so on;
develop a consent language; continually check GPS equip-
ment; and consider safeguarding records.
Another study by Ciocchetti (2011) classified each of the
top monitoring practices into one of the following types: (a)
best practices (e.g., monitoring that presents the greatest pro-
tection and minimizes invasion of employee privacy), (b)
risky practices (e.g., monitoring that offers rather low protec-
tion and minimally attacks employee privacy), (c) borderline
practices (e.g., monitoring that provides high protection, yet
is also highly insidious), and (d) poor practices (e.g., moni-
toring that provides low protection and is extremely inva-
sive). This classification system is likely to assist lawmakers
to balance both employer and employee interests when legal-
izing workplace technology. Ciocchetti viewed that the
American legal system has been sluggish to react effectively
and efficiently to the increasing invasiveness of modern
monitoring technology and that all monitoring practices are
disturbing and fall into the four categories just mentioned.
However, Bennett and Locke (1998) stated that an effective
way to avoid liability for privacy assault is to presuppose that
if an employee can litigate for such a tort, the employee will.
Research showed that employees can find an inclusive
source of privacy protection resulting from the common law
right to privacy, which consists of three misdeeds relevant to
the employment relationship: intrusion on seclusion, which
arises an encroachment is an intrusion on the property of
another without that person's permission; publicity given to
one's private life, which exists when an individual gives pub-
licity to an issue regarding the private life of another; and
publicity placing a person in a false light, which occurs when
an individual heedlessly disregards the falsity of the revealed
issue and the false light in which the other person would be
placed (Hames & Diersen, 1991). Alternatively, a set of
reforms developed by Conlon (1997) protect individual pri-
vacy concerns in the workplace:
·
· No monitoring should be done in restrooms, locker
rooms, and employee lounges; however, time spent
outside the workplace can be monitored in less odious
ways.
·
· Offsite monitoring should be banned; allow employ-
ees to access all information collected through moni-
toring methods or techniques and consider their
reflection on such information; and limit the duration
of monitoring each day with a suggested (maximum
of 2 hr per day).
·
· Employees should be aware of the devices that will be
used to monitor them, how the data will be used, and
when exactly they will be monitored; and employees
and customers should be notified when telephonic
monitoring is taking place through the use of a spe-
cific tone that can be heard by both employee and
customer.
·
· Employers should collect only information relevant to
making critical decisions; and it is not enough to jus-
tify monitoring by the need to increasing productivity
or enhancing performance, but also, employers should
be able to demonstrate how the goal was accom-
plished through the monitoring process.
Howsoever, the lawful foundation of the right to privacy
has a theoretical underpinning for legal intellectuals that may
becomplexforthepublictorecognizeorvalue(C.L.Swanson,
1988). Despite the different schools of thought among aca-
demics, numerous propositions have been offered for manage-
ment's contemplation: formulate why, how, and when
electronic monitoring is applied; gather only work-related
information; gather only information for the purpose of raising
employee performance; provide timely feedback to employees
so that corrective actions to performance can be done; secure
awards to individuals or group performance; educate employ-
ees about the behavioral and social features of electronic mon-
itoring; accentuate qualitative characteristics of performance
not accounted for by electronic monitoring; a trial period for
all new applicants or new electronic systems should be pro-
vided; avoid being too quick in developing new standards or
monitoring methods unless proven to be effective; and use
brainstorming sessions whenever possible to enhance the
Moussa 3
electronic monitoring system in the organization (Vaught,
Taylor, & Vaught, 2000). Nevertheless, too much monitoring
and the publicity of a monitoring culture throughout the
organization may create emotional and behavioral problems
that may ultimately thrust employees in to certain activities
to cheat the system (Barrett, 2008).
Intriguingly, Dillon and Thomas (2006) exposed that
there is a great need for universal consciousness and indul-
gence of accessibility, personal use, and administrative over-
sight issues involving e-mail and computers in the workplace;
otherwise, employees are unlikely to understand privacy
policies and procedures adequately. Wen, Schwieger, and
Gershuny (2007) reviewed surveillance technologies and
discussed the related federal and state laws along with U.S.
judicial decisions, and found that no U.S. federal or state law
prohibits employers from monitoring their electronic work-
place. Their scientific investigation also provided the follow-
ingstrategiesthatarelikelytobemosteffectiveandproductive
for both employees and employers, and help employers pre-
vent the negative aspects of monitoring: designating privacy
policy oversight and execution should be implemented by an
authority; consider a legal stand-point to legally guide the
development of all policies and procedures; develop a formal
policy and keep all employees informed of all modifications
to the policy; notify employees of the electronic monitoring
system; avoid an aggressive work environment; develop clear
rules on the use of e-mail; decide which data should and
should not be accessed; specify online time limits; maintain a
software running in the background of every computer, such
as popup blockers or spam filters; and communicate a policy
that is acceptable for instant messaging, blogging, and chat
room use in and out of the organization.
Haller (2002) also proposed the main ingredients of effec-
tive privacy policies: (a) notice, firms should provide stake-
holders with a prominent notice vis-à-vis its information
practices; (b) consumer choice, firms should give stakehold-
ers the freedom to choose whether it may divulge personal
data about them to unaffiliated third parties; (c) access and
correction, firms should accept their stakeholders to make
some corrections if necessary about personal data that they
have gathered about them; (d) security, firms should espouse
practical security measures to protect the privacy of personal
information, and these measures may comprise administra-
tive, physical, and technical security; and (e) enforcement,
firms should develop a system that can enforce its privacy
policy and ensure compliance with their own and external
standards. Moreover, maintaining a balance between employ-
ers' propensity to productivity and compliance with legisla-
tive procedures, corporations may be most successful in
practicing the following: creating unambiguous privacy
boundaries, developing privacy formula and principles, and
defending personal data (Townsend & Bennett, 2003).
Employers are less vulnerable regarding certain issues of
invasion of privacy, if written policies are communicated
effectively; however, Kovach, Jordan, Tansey, and Framinan
(2000) argued that too much monitoring generates a work-
place filled with gridlock, blame, cynicism, and distrust.
Practically speaking, to circumvent violations of employee
privacy in the workplace, employers should never promote a
culture of privacy within every quarter of an organization
because it may be essential to monitor some practices when
issues occur (Guffey & West, 1996). An ethical employer
will monitor employees' work within the provisions of a par-
ticular policy (Cowan, 2008). Corporations must enroll if
they are coping with personal information for any of the fol-
lowing purposes: private investigation, health administra-
tion, policing crime avoidance and trial of delinquents, legal
services, debt administration, trading, public casework, edu-
cation, research, administration of justice, consultancy ser-
vices, or a credit reporting system (Grupe, Kuechler, &
Sweeney, 2002).
Summed up briefly, Zachary (2013) acknowledged the
following: Workplace encroachment to privacy is of immense
concern to both employers and employees in the United
States, and violation of privacy has been augmented in
employment proceedings. Invasion of privacy may fall into
four categories: (a) information leakage that denigrates oth-
ers, (b) using someone else's name without consent, (c) inap-
propriate communication of private data, and (d) when a
perpetrator purposefully intrudes, physically, electronically,
or otherwise, on the private space of others. Courts vary
according to when the illegal intrusion exists, and employers
should be extremely vigilant to dissimilar types of invasion
of privacy. Remarkably, disputes to privacy rights in the
United States, which some view as a threat to eroding pri-
mary American values, have had an upsurge in controversy
over the degree to which rights formerly untouched may are
reduced because of the employer­employee relationship
(Anton & Ward, 1998). In the following section, the author
presents possible alternatives to electronic performance
monitoring (EPM).
Definitions of, Critiques of,
and Alternatives to, Electronic
Performance Monitoring (EPM)
According to Belcourt, Bohlander, and Snell (2008),
employee monitoring acts involve monitoring Internet links,
review of e-mails, telephone use, video surveillance for secu-
rity purposes, storage and review of computer files, video
recording of employee job performance, recording and review
of telephone conversations, and storage and review of voice-
mail messages. Dessler (2011) noted that EPM systems are
intended to allow employers access to their employees' com-
puters and telephones to monitor the amount of time spent
working on the Internet, to enhance productivity. This paradox
necessitates the establishment of a security system for all data
garnered by employers to thwart the theft of sensitive informa-
tion, particularly to those outside the organization (Mello,
2006). In a similar vein, new information technologies allow
4 SAGE Open
employers to monitor employee work performance, even
when the employee is not notified about the monitoring pro-
cess (Nelson & Quick, 2006). Nonetheless, Mathis and
Jackson (1997) verified that employee performance is not
driven by management, but eventually by the employees
themselves. For instance, ethical behavior is not based solely
on the decisions and actions of an organization's authorities,
but also encompasses the actions of every employee (Dlabay,
Burrow, & Eggland, 2006). They construed that ethical
behavior consists of the actions of individuals and groups
and the results of those actions.
Moreover, performance criteria for measuring job perfor-
mance can be categorized as "trait-based," "behavior-
based," or "results-based." However, courts in the United
States declared and affirmed that evaluations based on traits
such as flexibility are too blurred and indistinct (Mathis &
Jackson, 1997). Although it can be argued that employers
should measure performance criteria in terms of time versus
productivity. In other words, employees can be paid or com-
pensated for time spent on particular tasks or on the amount
of work produced. Aside from this, Mathis and Jackson
claimed that a performance evaluation should be contem-
plated regarding assessment to achieve its purpose objec-
tively and subjectively. Objective measures may be in terms
of counted quantities or amounts; whereas, subjective mea-
sures may be apposite for casual or informal mistakes. Other
performance measures acknowledged by Mathis and Jackson
(2000) were category rating methods, a graphic rating scale,
a checklist, or a combination of methods. Employers should
articulate what they want to accomplish from a performance
appraisal system to obtain the desired advantages with regard
to perceptions and rights of the organization's employees.
Comprehensively, Dessler (2003) discussed achievable
and indispensable factors that might lead to developing a
legally justifiable performance appraisal system, as follows:
(a) make certain what a successful performance means,
undertake a job analysis to recognize the critical require-
ments needed, and amalgamate these criteria into a rating
tool; (b) define job performance magnitude, write and com-
municate performance criteria to all employees and employ-
ers, and avoid broad terms, such as "integrity" and
"hardworking," unless you can lead by example or model the
behavior you desire; (c) use subjective supervisory ratings as
only one part of the overall evaluation process, train evalua-
tors how to use the rating instrument effectively, authorize
evaluators to approach the employees they are evaluating,
and conclude your evaluation on different measures for each
of the job's performance criteria; (d) have more than one
evaluator and perform all evaluations independently to
reduce biases and errors, employees should be given the
freedom to review their appraisals and make comments
before completion, and supplement your personnel decisions
with documents and reasons; and (e) whenever possible, pro-
vide supervision to aid low performers at work. In addition,
a workforce should attempt to be consciously and intently
aware of the idea that high-performance work systems are
likely to fail without timely and accurate communication
(Bohlander & Snell, 2004).
Norton (2006) disclosed that people should realize that
their interests and practices are being monitored automati-
cally and routinely because the monitoring can be accom-
plished through programs running on their computers or a
connected server. Norton also reported that
there are commercial profiles for most people in the United
Sates based on the browsing activity of a particular IP address.
This address is tied to the name of the owner of that address no
matter who is doing the actual browsing. The reports contain
information about browsing habits and may contain
accompanying marketing conclusions, called psychographic
data. (p. 541)
Computer technology today supports many performance
management systems, and employers frequently accumulate
records of employee performance measures, punitive actions,
and work rule violations in electronic files (Noe, Hollenbeck,
Gerhart, & Wright, 2007). They also added that Congress has
developed laws to legalize computer monitoring, but in the
meantime, employers should consider employee feedback to
this type of performance analysis. Once critical issue is that
social forecasting, opinion surveys, social audits, issue man-
agement, and social/executive scanning can systematically
measure the economic performance of an organization
(Bartol & Martin, 1991). Thus, here, the author argues that
many alternatives to electronic monitoring may be effective
and are likely to satisfy an employer's vision or objectives
without violating rights of privacy. Employers should not
disregard the three feasible interpretations of the job satisfac-
tion and performance relationship: satisfaction leads to per-
formance, performance leads to satisfaction, and rewards
lead to both performance and satisfaction (Schermerhorn,
2011).
Other alternatives to electronic monitoring may include
the primary measures of productivity, such as total product
(TP), the highest level of outcome that can be accomplished
within a specific amount of inputs; average product (AP), an
assessment of the outcome achieved per unit of input; and
marginal product (MP), the change in total output divided by
the change in capital (Baye, 2009). Arguably, employers who
justify electronic monitoring by boosting productivity in the
workplace may want to exercise the following: assuage or
eliminate bureaucracy, revise all systems and recognize high
quality employees, overcome problems, share your vision
throughout the organization, question your employees and
listen to them carefully, be honest and have integrity, turn
customers into strategic partners, and develop effective per-
formance-based pay plans (Moss, 2006).
What is more, the increasing use of e-mail and voice-mail
augmented every employer's risks of being legally respon-
sible if they monitor or check employee electronic communi-
cations. As a result, the Electronic Communications Privacy
Moussa 5
Act (ECPA) was passed in 1986. This is the only federal law
that has permitted listening to, or detecting, employee elec-
tronic communication for business purposes, only if there is
consent provided by the employee for this act (Mathis &
Jackson, 2000). Although the ECPA proscribed the inten-
tional interception of employees' oral, wire, and electronic
communication, it included two significant workplace excep-
tions, which are as follows:
·
· The "business purpose exception," which constitutes
consent to monitoring as long as the employer is capa-
ble of showing genuine business reasons for this
action.
·
· The "consent exception" allows employers to monitor
employee communications when employees have
given their permission to do so (Dessler, 2011; Mello,
2011).
According to the Bureau of National Affairs (2012),
In the United States, only Maryland, Illinois, and California
have laws that limit employer access to employee social media
accounts. Fourteen states considered such legislation in 2012,
according to materials provided at the webcast, and federal bills
have been introduced. (p. 8)
The close auspices and supervision by employers are, per-
haps, the major benefit from an electronic monitoring sys-
tem; however, some employees appreciate them because
they benefit them, whereas others consider them a violation
of privacy (DuBrin, 2009). DuBrin (2006) articulated that
high-technology monitoring devices can be useful with
employees who carry out quantifiable tasks during working
hours, such as employees in financial institutions and call
centers. Another view presented by Robbins and Coulter
(1999) was that many individuals consider electronic moni-
toring as just a technologically complicated type of eaves-
dropping, or a surveillance method to catch employees who
are practicing illegal activities during their working hours.
Critics also declare that electronic monitoring can backfire
and raise employee stress because of being watched continu-
ally (Dessler, 2011). The next part of this article is a discus-
sion of some reasons behind employee monitoring and
leadership behaviors in organizations.
Motives Behind Employee Monitoring
and Leadership Behaviors
Belcourt et al. (2008) found that motives behind employee
monitoring are varied, such as, to prevent inappropriate
actions of employees; to emphasize the need for the effective
use of the organization's time; to minimize employee gossip;
to abolish the viewing of pornographic webpages; and to
protect employees' personnel information from becoming
accessible to hackers who are likely to use the information
inappropriately. Moreover, abuses by some employees, such
as using the organization's computer for gambling, engaging
in private businesses, playing computer games, or pursuing
personal affairs, have led to many employers engaging in a
greater policing role (DeCenzo & Robbins, 2005). However,
monitoring systems can be used to accumulate, process, and
give performance feedback about employees' work that can
assist managers with performance improvement propositions
and with employee development (Robbins & Coulter, 1999).
Employers justify their interference into employee privacy
by stating their genuine interest in some of the employees'
personal matters, especially when those matters such as drug
and alcohol use, criminal activity, or dating a colleague may
directly affect workplace productivity, safety, and ethical
standards (Bohlander & Snell, 2004).
Another significant issue is that employers need to moni-
tor decision execution to ensure that things are making prog-
ress as planned, and that problems have been identified and
resolved (Bartol & Martin, 1991). Today, monitoring is far
beyond spying on employees' phones and e-mails. For
instance, Dessler (2000, 2011) mentioned that location moni-
toring has become pervasive, which involves following the
location and movement of employees, because as DuBrin
(2006) stated, a major factor to electronic monitoring is that
employees often work far from their managers, including at
home, hotels, or in coffee shops. One solid reason behind
monitoring employees is that employers can be sued for what
their employees send to each other and to individuals outside
the organization (Haag & Cummings, 2010; Mathis &
Jackson, 2000). Haag and Cummings also enumerated
employers'motives behind seeking and storing personal data
about their employees, such as the need to recruit the best
staff possible and prevent being charged for employees'
practices in the organization, and to ensure that employees
are not wasting or misusing the organization' s resources.
They reported the FBI's statement that 78% of selected orga-
nizations indicated that employees download pornography,
pirate software, and engage in other activities unrelated to
their work, and 60% of employees use the Internet for per-
sonal use at work. Organizations reportedly lost $5.3 billion
because of frivolous web activities in 1999 (Dessler, 2003).
Employee monitoring is intended to measure the amount
of work produced, to check for theft, or to enforce an organi-
zation's rules and policies (Mathis & Jackson, 1997). Experts
have estimated that employee theft (e.g., theft of merchan-
dise, embezzlement, industrial espionage, computer crime,
acts of sabotage, and misuse of time on the job) causes U.S.
businesses to spend more than $400 billion annually (Gomez-
Mejia, Balkin, & Cardy, 2004). Therefore, employers are
struggling to fight against various types of theft by using
electronic surveillance gadgets to monitor employees, which
some would call spying on employees. Gomez-Mejia et al.
(2004) urged employers to do the following: provide guide-
lines to all employees for the rules regarding exchanging
messages and information, and the acceptable use of the
6 SAGE Open
Internet; discover positive uses for electronic monitoring
tools that are valuable and advantageous to both employers
and employees; create an "antitheft policy" and post it
throughout the organization; and prevent secret monitoring,
except in specific cases (i.e., only with a court order).
In addition, technology has facilitated employees acting
in immoral, irrelevant, and illegal ways, which created ethi-
cal, productivity, and legal dilemmas for organizations and
forced employers to monitor employee practices (Belcourt
et al., 2008). However,
Work rules that are too strict or confining will impede the
fulfillment of such human needs as those for affiliation,
cooperation, autonomy, and self-actualization and may lead to
subterfuge and resentment. Rules that are too lax may lead to
inefficiencies as well as moral problems. Work rules that tend to
protect jobs, may provide job security in the short run but, if too
restrictive, may have serious consequences for organizational
effectiveness and survival in the long run. (French, 1994, p. 204)
In addition, several court decisions acknowledged an
avowed policy of monitoring employees and employers of
both private and public sectors to conduct workplace investi-
gation for theft and other banned practices (Mathis &
Jackson, 2000). Therefore, more than 80% of large corpora-
tions are now using such technology that can be used to mon-
itor not only Internet usage but also e-mails, computer files,
voice-mail, and telephone usage (Mello, 2006).
It also has been found that employees waste time when
they extend lunch periods, when they use the telephone for
personal matters, when they abuse sick leave, when they use
unauthorized absenteeism, or when they work for another
employer on their primary employer's time. Thus, Gomez-
Mejia et al. (2004) noted that employers use unseen micro-
phones and transmitters linked to telephones and tiny fish
eye video lenses fixed behind pinholes in walls and ceilings
to spy on employees to eradicate such wastage. Needless to
say, many employees consider this close management and
supervision very dehumanizing (Stair & Reynolds, 2008).
Thus, it can be said that overwhelmingly, monitoring has a
dubious reputation because of cases of abuse and overuse.
Baltzan and Phillips (2009) mentioned that a primary goal of
information technology monitoring is tracking employee
assignments by such measures as the frequency of errors
made on a particular task and the number of tasks performed
within a specific period.
Above all, two pertinent questions should be taken into con-
sideration in organizations that advocate and implement moni-
toring technology: (a) What does this technology add to the
organization? and (b) Does the organization trust its employ-
ees?According to Gomez-Mejia et al. (2004), augmenting trust
can be difficult, particularly in organizations with a culture of
cynicism. There are many arguments about centralization ver-
sus decentralization management approaches, in the sense
where employees may have maximum restrictions concerning
operations and minimum autonomy, or minimum restrictions
and maximum autonomy. Furthermore, corporations should
continually obtain answers to the following questions
(McCalman & Paton, 1992): How autonomous are the sys-
tems? What relationships exist? How relevant are they? Will
developments lead to re-definition of boundaries? Can the
complexities of the change environment be simplified?
Having determined the general environment, employers
could then emphasize irrelevancies or deficiencies in the sys-
tem as a whole.
Undoubtedly, the rise of technology causes ethical chal-
lenges in organizations. The rise and the use of technology
cohere with and emerge from an organizational culture, val-
ues, and leadership style. Yet, relatively little effort has been
made to study and compare leadership approaches systemati-
cally, in the context of how leaders should react to employee
monitoring through technology. Luthans and Doh (2009)
distinguished between three types of leadership as follows:
(a) authoritarian leadership (e.g., the use of one-way com-
munication from top to bottom with an emphasis on work
progress and procedures that diminish work output, and final
decisions usually made by the upper-level of management);
(b) paternalistic leadership, or belief in reciprocity (e.g.,
work hard and the organization will offer a person more
bonuses); and (c) participative leadership (e.g., authority is
greatly decentralized). Certo and Certo (2009) also distin-
guished between four types of leadership as follows: (a)
superleadership (i.e., leading by example), (b) servant lead-
ership (i.e., the perception that a leader's primary duty is to
help subordinates to fulfill their desires, or interests), (c)
entrepreneurial leadership (i.e., the perception that the leader
is self-employed), and (d) transformational leadership (i.e.,
leadership that has the capability to inspire organizational
success and influence followers' beliefs in what can shape a
successful organization.
Accordingly, the focal point is that the most effective
leadership style to monitor employee performance using
technology remains unidentified. Predominantly, the behav-
iors of employers are being scrutinized, and corporate gover-
nance models increasingly commit to selecting only those
with high ethical conducts to be held responsible for their
practices and the consequences of those practices (Griffin,
2008). According to Gomez-Mejia et al. (2004), the use of
electronic monitoring has posed serious questions about how
it may lead to a great deal of stress and dehumanizing effects
on employees. The following is related to strategies that may
reduce stress resulting from monitoring practices in
organizations.
Advice That Makes Monitoring Less
Distressful
First, Griffin (2008) succinctly presented causes and conse-
quences of stress. Griffin elaborated that "organizational
stressors" involve (a) task demands (i.e., rapid decisions,
inadequate information for decisions, and critical decisions),
Moussa 7
(b) physical demands including environmental factors (e.g.,
poor offices, temperature), (c) role demands (i.e., role con-
flict and role ambiguity), and (d) interpersonal demands (i.e.,
group pressures, leadership paradigms, and disharmony
among individuals). Griffin added that the consequences of
stress can be both positive and negative, and the negative
ones involve behavioral, psychological, or medical matters.
Logically, employee level of satisfaction, motivation, com-
mitment, loyalty, and integrity in the workplace can be
affected as a result of extreme levels of stress. The crucial
point here is that the use of EPM has created a great deal of
tension and pressure among individuals in organizations.
Nelson and Quick (2006) made three recommendations that
can help make electronic workplace monitoring less distress-
ful. These include orientating employees about the monitor-
ing system; setting fair performance standards; and using
documentation, or records, for benign purposes rather than
for sanctions. Alternatively, another school of thought articu-
lated that reducing stress causes some problems for employ-
ers; thus, stress is recommended for healthy organizations
and without it, employees lack energy (DeCenzo & Robbins,
2005). Schermerhorn (2011) also reflected that stress is com-
prised of two types: (a) "constructive stress," and sometimes
called "eustress," is personally energizing and performance-
enhancing, urges greater endeavors, inspires creativity, and
enhances commitment, while still not devastating the indi-
vidual or causing undesirable consequences, and (b)
"destructive stress," which arises when there is a severe
stress that may affect an individual's physical and mental
systems and lead to job burnout or aggressive behavior
toward others in the workplace.
DeCenzo and Robbins (2005) discovered employee
involvement and participation, making certain that employ-
ees are properly matched in their jobs and fully aware of the
extent of their authority, and familiarizing them with what is
expected are all factors that eliminate stress, conflict, and
ambiguity in organizations. Similarly, two-way communica-
tion and employee involvement in the structural system or
frame reduce stress and enhance perceptions of fairness or
justice (Mathis & Jackson, 1997). However, we should dif-
ferentiate between three types of organizational justice: (a)
distributive justice--derived from the evaluation of the prod-
uct of the business interactions; (b) procedural justice--
derived from the procedures, or actions that generate the
results; and (c) interactional justice--derived from the eval-
uation of the communication process used in business con-
tacts (Ferrell, Fraedrich, & Ferrell, 2009).
Portolese-Dias and Shah (2009) noted that employers can
listen to employees' telephone communication, monitor
e-mail in a search for clandestine trade, listen to harassing
messages, monitor non-work related traffic, and monitor
conflicts of interest. In short, to deal with the latent vulnera-
bilities where information technology (IT) negatively affects
the satisfaction of employees, management needs to consider
that employee satisfaction should be the highest priority and
strategic objective (Thompson & Cats-Baril, 2003). Toward
this end, privacy and security issues are contemporary chal-
lenges that IT individuals and businesspeople must confront
and understand. Next, employee monitoring policies will be
discussed.
Employee Monitoring Policies
The frequent anxiety in a monitored organization is generally
not whether monitoring should take place, but how it should
be performed, how the information should be utilized, and
how feedback should be communicated to all individuals in
the organization. However, employers should reduce ethical
concerns by considering the following policies: (a) Voice-
mail, e-mail, and computer files provided by the organization
are solely for business purposes, (b) all computer passwords
must be accessible to the employer, and (c) the employer has
the right to monitor any practice without prior notification
for business purposes only (Mathis & Jackson, 1997).
DeCenzo and Robbins (2005) succinctly stated that whatever
employers consider reasonable, they should proffer for
employees in a written policy. The main theory behind com-
municating employers' policies to all employees is that
employees are more likely to accept electronic monitoring if
their employers' main purpose is to improve performance
(Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2007).
Similarly, electronic monitoring seems preferable when
policy statements create expectations of job performance in
the mind of the employee (French, 1994). Thus, the best path
for an organization planning to engage in employee monitor-
ing involves open communication; formulating the appropri-
ate monitoring policies and putting them into practice; and
unequivocally stating how, when, and where the company
monitors its employees (Baltzan & Phillips, 2009). In other
words, Belcourt et al. (2008) informed that human resources
experts and legal authorities strongly encourage employers
to develop clear policies that elucidate how e-mail and the
Internet are to be used, including when and under what cir-
cumstances employees can be monitored. Thus, employees
could realize that the use of their organization's Internet to
shop, browse, view inappropriate webpages, or conduct per-
sonal business during work hours is an illegal action that is
likely to cause undesirable consequences.
Moreover, Mello (2006, 2011) suggested that employers
should develop a lucid and succinct policy and communicate
it to all employees, if they choose to monitor their employ-
ees' use of telecommunications equipment. Above and
beyond, monitoring should be consistent with both the over-
all objectives of the organization and performance dilem-
mas; nonetheless, employers' policies should not create
stress and distrust on their employees. From a moral and
legal perspective, employers need to consider the following
tasks to minimize potential revelation to lawsuits: (a) develop
an electronic communication policy, (b) notify employees
and have them sign a consent form, and (c) rigorously
8 SAGE Open
implement every segment of the policy and monitor usage
for business practices only (Mathis & Jackson, 2000).
Another ethical dilemma is the balancing of improvements
in productivity and efficiency versus dehumanization of the
workplace (Thompson & Cats-Baril, 2003).
Not surprisingly, there are variations in how employers
expect their employees to use computers in a working day;
therefore, employees should be informed of the rules and
consent to abide by them (Baltzan & Phillips, 2009).
Nevertheless, people will continue to live on the edge of
intolerable frustration and always be exasperated by comput-
ers as long as technology proposes alluring products and ser-
vices (Odlyzko, 1999). Hence, the best path for an employer
planning to be involved in employee monitoring is open
communication surrounding the issue (Baltzan & Phillips,
2009). Moreover, Baltzan and Phillips enumerated the fol-
lowing policies:
·
· An information privacy policy includes general crite-
ria regarding information privacy.
·
· "Acceptable use policy" (AUP) is a policy that a user
must accept to pursue to gain access to a network, or
the Internet.
·
· The development and implementation of an "e-mail
privacy policy" allows employers to lessen various
risks.
·
· "Internet use policy" involves guidelines in how to
use the Internet properly.
·
· With an "anti-spam policy," users are not allowed to
send unwelcomed e-mails to others.
With the purpose of reducing ethical concerns, Mathis and
Jackson (1997) claimed that employers should consider some
policies. These include the following: electronic devices are
provided by the employer for business purposes only, the use
of such electronic devices for personal use is forbidden, all
computer passwords must be in the hands of the employer,
and the employer has the right to monitor such practices for
business purposes without further notification. Quite simply,
if the employer clarifies the purpose of electronic monitoring
in the organization and links it to performance improvement,
the employees are more likely to embrace such a policy (Noe,
Hollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2007). Legal action appears
most effective when employment processes and policy proc-
lamations have aided in building expectations of job perfor-
mance in the mentality of the employees (French, 1994).
Finally, it is strongly recommended that employers distribute
feedback on monitoring outcomes, to assist employees in
improving their performance or to praise them for good per-
formance. The following section involves reviewing policies
and procedures in organizations.
Reviewing Policies and Procedures
To ascertain whether employees in an organization are fol-
lowing customary procedures, the next step is to review
practices and implement curative actions if required. For
example, a significant number of organizations conduct
internal audits to measure current results against established
objectives. Stair and Reynolds (2008, p. 387) recommended
that people pose the following questions to specify whether
present policies and procedures are satisfactory:
·
· Do current policies cover existing practices ade-
quately? Were any problems or opportunities uncov-
ered during monitoring?
·
· Does the organization plan any new activities in the
future? If so, does it need new policies or procedures
concerning who will handle them and what must be
done?
·
· Are contingencies and disasters covered?
Answers to these questions are likely to assist and enhance
a company's performance and productivity, as well as being
alert to unpredictable information that could have negative
influences on the organization's system. Hence, organiza-
tions should make a thorough effort to guarantee that all
employees are responsive to existing policies, through for-
mal training, for example (Baltzan & Phillips, 2009). Cascio
and Aguinis (2011) shared that employers should thoroughly
review their policies and acknowledge the following: (a) the
number and types of documents an organization sustains
concerning employees, former employees, and applicants;
(b) the information preserved in each type of document or
record; (c) the uses of information inside the organization;
(d) the exposure made to the external environment (e.g.,
external stakeholders, suppliers, stockholders); and (e) the
degree to which employees are familiar with and accredited
of the utilization and exposure of information about them in
the records department. In addition, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, Cascio and Aguinis advised employers to express,
converse, and execute fair information-practice policies by
the following means: gather information about individuals
who are likely to have an influence on the organization's
decision; acknowledge the ways information is to be used by
employers; advocate and champion practical methods for
achieving accuracy, timeliness, and richness of information
about employees; restrict the use of such records by applying
security gauges; control information leakage to unauthorized
parties; and ensure compliance with expressed fair informa-
tion-practice policies. The last section in this article is a dis-
cussion about the role of human resource development
(HRD) in employee assessment and development.
The Role of HRD in Employee
Assessment and Development
This study focuses on ideas and competencies that can be
associated with the HRD and human resource management
(HRM) roles or functions in organizations. The author of this
article believes that HRD is a field of study that emphasizes
fundamental aspects of behavioral and developmental issues
Moussa 9
in organizations. In this sense, HRD efforts can be critical in
monitoring employee behavior and performance in organiza-
tions. According to Megginson, Banfield, and Joy-Matthews
(2001),
It is as important to know when a HRD response is appropriate
to a particular situation as it is to recognize when it is not. The
implementation of HRD strategies must, therefore, be based on
a clear and accurate understanding of the problems and needs
that require managerial action, and of what HRD can realistically
contribute to these. (p. 134)
McGuire and Jorgensen (2011) noted that "the relation-
ship of HRD with HRM has attracted some comment,
although a consensus is emerging regarding the separate and
distinct identity of HRD" (p. 9). They also added that it
would be foolish to disavow that there are no relationships
between HRM and HRD.
The literature used to argue the case in this article was
drawn from areas that are pertinent to HRD, such as work-
place productivity and organizational effectiveness; percep-
tions and rights of the organization's employees; employee
feedback, motivation, creativity, commitment, loyalty, integ-
rity, and level of satisfaction; coaching and supervision to aid
low performers at work; performance improvement provi-
sions; employee involvement, development, and participa-
tion; irrelevancies or deficiencies in the organization's
system; and perceptions of fairness or justice in organiza-
tions. Evidently, the discussion of multifaceted topics con-
cerning ethical or unethical behavior in organizations has
become prominent in HRD literature in recent years
(Ardichvili, Mitchell, & Jondle, 2009). Hence, HRD efforts
could emphasize as well as protect the value of individual
privacy in organizations and promote cherished organiza-
tional values. From a theoretical point of view, several ques-
tions extend the HRD field as it reflects on the impact of
performancemanagementsystemsinorganizations(Buchner,
2007). Two of these questions were posed in this article to
promote and stimulate further investigation and discussion.
First, why do employers often recognize the value of install-
ing sophisticated computer systems to perform more effec-
tively, instead of spending time or money in developing the
organization's individuals? According to Megginson et al.
(2001), thinking of HRD as an investment rather than a cost
can help change mind-sets; however, spending time or
money on developing an individual is often perceived as a
cost. Second, do employers trust their employees in organi-
zations? Effron, Gandossy, and Goldsmith (2003) noted that
organizations that succeed are those that evoke our greatest
human capacities: our need to be in good relationships and our
desire to contribute to something beyond ourselves. These
qualities cannot be evoked through procedures and policies;
they are available only in organizations in which people feel
trusted and welcome and in which people know that their work
matters. (p. 194)
The purpose of some HRD factors is to tutor, develop, and
educate individuals in organizations, with a vision to boost
employee productivity and enhance organizational effective-
ness (Metcalfe & Rees, 2005). Another working definition is
that HRD is concerned with the perceptions that organiza-
tions are human-made entities that count on human expertise
to create and accomplish their objectives, and that HRD pro-
fessionals are advocates of the organization's individuals,
work processes, and organizational integrity (Hassan, 2006).
Likewise, the HRD function contributes to the preservation
of the well-being of the organization as a social entity, and its
support and development of the organization's performance
as an economic entity (Yorks, 2005). According to Garavan,
McGuire, and O'Donnell (2004), HRD is a multidisciplinary
construction with multiple perspectives. Therefore, HRD
professionals are required to think differently, respond to
new and unique problems, and use special lenses, as their
jobs and duties become increasingly challenging (Garavan,
O'Donnell, McGuire, & Watson, 2007). Similarly, Torraco
and Swanson (1995) noted that
HRD serves a broad range of interests and outcomes in
organizations. The primary purposes to be served by HRD can
range from programs intended to meet the personal development
needs of individuals (e.g., identifying individual learning styles
or personal financial planning) to HRD programs necessary for
everyone in the organization (e.g., programs addressing a new
performance appraisal method or role changes secondary to
structural reorganization. (p. 9)
A critical issue where HRD can provide valuable insight
is the area of employee performance evaluation. Ethical
commitment in performance evaluation will maintain integ-
rity around the intricacy of learning and performance pro-
cesses (Short, Bing, & Kehrhahn, 2003). A leader's ability to
act with integrity is crucial for building trust among individ-
uals in organizations (Wooten & James, 2008). Interestingly,
Hatcher (2002) argued that technology is driving the need for
ethical HRD, because technology challenges our ethics and
what we consider valuable. In addition, what technology can
do in HRD can be perceived in terms of strategies in the full
application of technology and the human need for personal
connection (R. A. Swanson & Holton, 2001). Moreover,
HRD professionals must guarantee that both human (employ-
ees) and technological processes (monitoring through the use
of technology) work effectively and in line with the overall
organizational strategies.
More importantly, to play a primary role in promoting ethi-
cal business cultures, HRD will need to thoroughly engage in
a system of interrelated and well-coordinated activities
(Ardichvili & Jondle, 2009). This includes the amalgamation
of ethics in leadership development programs that promote
ethical culture, and strengthen ethical decision-making skills
and review of codes of ethics, as illustrated earlier in this arti-
cle. In addition, because the practice of HRD involves enlight-
ening the workforce to actively participate in the marketplace,
10 SAGE Open
HRD as a domain has a chance to approach leadership devel-
opment and culture in the current global economy (Kowske
& Anthony, 2007).
Noticeably, HRD studies should inspire organizations
how to maintain the psychological well-being of their
employees and examine the following questions that con-
cern the organization's employees' well-being: (a) What
makes people happy in their organizations? and (b) What is
a good architecture for HRD programs that should stimulate
passion and energy among the workforce? (Van der Sluis,
2007). Thus, employers should recognize employee rights,
determine an individual's contribution to the organization,
inform employees how well they are performing their tasks,
reveal their criteria in their performance management sys-
tem, and provide ongoing feedback on the employees' per-
formance, as well as coaching and supervising low
performers on a regular basis. It is also recommended that
an HRD professional's first challenge is to cautiously inves-
tigate the performance dilemma and to build a diagnostic
framework. Yorks (2005) thoroughly interpreted how to
build the diagnostic framework as follows: (a) describing
the problematic performance state (e.g., what has been
occurring based on data and observation without any analy-
sis), (b) identifying symptoms (e.g., critical incidents and
behaviors related to the situation), (c) identifying the prob-
lem (e.g., determine the source of the symptoms), and finally
(d) matching the solution to the problem. In short, HRD per-
forms significant role in improving employee performance
and looks at making the organizational system more effec-
tive through a plethora of tactics (McGuire & Jorgensen,
2011).
Following this line of thought, and the various definitions
of HRD capabilities, the author of this article comfortably
justifies that HRD efforts and contributions in monitoring
employee behavior and performance can stimulate and
develop numerous aspects of the workforce, in line with the
organization's goals, without encroaching on individuals'
privacy.
Recommendations for Further Studies
Further studies may explore the most effective leadership
styles, traits, and behaviors required to monitor employee
performance using technology in organizations. It would
also be useful if we could realize how far employers should
go concerning monitoring employee behavior in organiza-
tions. Another significant issue that can be explored in future
studies is the cost associated with the use of software and
technological devices to monitor employee performance.
Practitioners may also need to be aware of what kind of soft-
ware packages can be the most relevant to particular projects
in small, medium, and large organizations. In addition,
DeCenzo and Robbins (2005) found that there are a number
of questions that remained unanswered in various studies,
such as the following:
1. How much should managers know about their
employees and how far should they go in controlling
their behavior in and out the workplace?
2. When does an employer's need for information about
employee performance invade an employee's right to
privacy?
3. Do employers have the right to monitor whatever
they want as long as employees are notified in
advance that they will be monitored?
4. What about the delimitation or the boundary between
monitoring work and non-work behavior?
5. Do employers have the right to monitor their employ-
ees at home during evenings and weekends?
Further studies may explore social media, smart phones,
tablets, or other devices raising monitoring dilemmas in
today's workplace. Finally, future studies may postulate how
organizations can measure their return on investment (ROI)
in electronic devices and how much is enough to implement
a technology venture in organizations.
Conclusion
By monitoring, employers often argue that they are able to
protect their organizations from any harm. In this sense,
monitoring is perceived as a tool to maintain the security of
an organization. New technologies have not only offered
organizations reasons to monitor employees' behavior, but
these technologies have also provided new methods and
techniques to perform employee monitoring. Thus, technol-
ogy must be treated with caution and discretion. Employers
should realize that employees may retaliate against the orga-
nization for the perceived unfair monitoring practices.
Therefore, it is essential when applying new technologies to
monitor employee behavior to take into account many con-
cerns (e.g., privacy, needs, and aspirations). Educating
employees about the reasons behind monitoring them, devel-
oping a wide range of policies and procedures, and commu-
nicating them effectively will be vital to successfully
implement a monitoring system.
The failure of employers to recognize employee rights
can cause extensive loss, such as expensive lawsuits, damage
to the organization's reputation, and impairment of employee
values. Hence, employers should balance the need for pro-
ductivity with regard to employee rights to privacy, safety,
and security. Focusing on accomplishments rather than time
spent in the workplace should be the main concern for any
employer. In other words, there is no need to police a work-
force because no one can work 8 hr without breaks, and a
culture of disloyalty and distrust within the organization may
emerge. However, employees should be aware that there are
numerous software packages that could key log everything
they type, search, and read on their computers.
This study offers many alternatives to EPM that are likely
to satisfy an employer's objectives without violating rights
Moussa 11
of privacy. Another significant issue raised in this study is
that the most effective leadership style to monitor employee
performance and behavior through technology remains
unidentified. From the author's point of view, there is no
need to define what a moral behavior is in mature and healthy
organizations, but it is crucial to shed light on how to use
technologies without violating ethical protocols. Technology
is a tool that can be used ethically and unethically. After
reviewing a large number of studies on employee percep-
tions of electronic monitoring, the author found that the use
of EPM has created a great deal of tension and pressure
among individuals in organizations. Therefore, the author
argued that employee level of satisfaction, motivation, com-
mitment, loyalty, and integrity in the workplace can be
affected as a result of extreme levels of stress. Hence, educat-
ing employees about the monitoring system and setting fair
performance criteria, distributive justice, procedural justice,
and interactional justice can make monitoring less distress-
ful. Importantly, monitoring should be consistent with both
the overall objectives of the organization and performance
dilemmas; however, employers' policies should not create
stress and distrust on their employees. Above and beyond,
the author of this study argued that HRD efforts can be sig-
nificant in monitoring employee behavior and performance
in organizations. The rationale behind this school of thought
is that HRD field emphasizes crucial elements of behavioral
and developmental matters in organizations.
