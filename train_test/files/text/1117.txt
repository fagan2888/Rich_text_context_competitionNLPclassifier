Objective To examine the longitudinal associations between supportive relationships
with friends and parents and sexual risk behavior in adolescence based on an ecological­
transactional perspective. Methods Analyses were conducted on 2,652 sexually active
adolescents from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health). Results African-American adolescents had lower risk for sexual risk behavior.
Supportive friendships and parent connectedness interacted in predicting decreased likelihood
of sexual risk behavior. Mother­child communication about sex contributed to decreased like-
lihood of sexual risk only for girls. There were also small reciprocal effects of sexual risk behavior
on decreased relationship quality over time. Conclusion To better understand the parents'
role in adolescent sexual risk behavior, multiple facets of parenting, the social contexts of
parenting and adolescents' peers, and the effects of adolescents' behavior on these relationships
should be taken into consideration.
Key words adolescence; friends; HIV/AIDS; parents; sexual risk behavior.
In the United States, AIDS is the leading cause of death
for adults between the ages of 25 and 44 (Center for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, 2002). Owing to the long
incubation period of HIV (Center for Disease Control,
2001), it is likely that many of these adults were infected
with HIV during adolescence. In fact, according to the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2003a), in
1999 at least half of all new HIV infections were among
people under the age of 25. These alarmingly high rates
of youth HIV infection are linked to adolescents' engage-
ment in sexual risk behaviors. Of all youth AIDS cases in
2000, 59% of males and 45% of females contracted HIV
through sexual intercourse (Center for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2002). In 2003, of sexually active high-
school students nationwide, 37% reported that neither
they nor their partner had used a condom during last
sexual intercourse (Center for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, 2004) and just over one quarter (25.4%) had
used alcohol or drugs during their last sexual encounter
(Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004).
Since the early 1990s, the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (2003a) has documented both racial and
gender shifts in the populations affected by the HIV epi-
demic, and the shifts are most marked among adoles-
cents. Although females over 25 years of age make up a
third of all those infected with HIV, females under 25
make up 51% of HIV infections among youth (Center for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2003b). Additionally,
African-Americans represent more than half of all new
HIV infections (Center for Disease Control, 2000). These
statistics point to the importance of investigating sexual
behaviors associated with risk of acquiring HIV infection
during adolescence as well as how best to protect adoles-
cents from these risk behaviors, especially those groups
increasingly affected by the epidemic. Efforts to explicate
the processes associated with sexual risk behavior in ado-
lescence have the ability to affect youth social contexts,
increase the visibility of adolescence susceptibility to HIV
infection, and inform youth intervention and prevention
efforts (e.g., Dittus, Miller, Kotchick, & Forehand, 2004).

Supportive Relationships and Sexual Risk 287
This study, espousing an ecological­transactional
theoretical approach, investigates the role of supportive
relationships with parents and friends as potential
protective factors against the development of adolescent
sexual risk behavior. According to this approach,
understanding adolescent behavioral risk and protec-
tive factors requires the consideration of ecological
effects, that is the social contexts in which the risk and
protection occurs (Bronfenbrenner, 1977; Cicchetti &
Lynch, 1993), as well as transactional effects, that is the
reciprocal nature of the relationship between adoles-
cents' behavior and their social contexts (e.g., Cicchetti,
Toth, & Maughan, 2000; Coatsworth et al., 2000;
Sameroff, 1995). The ecological/transactional approach
emphasizes that the most proximal influences, such
as family and friends, may have the greatest effects
on developmental outcomes (Cicchetti et al., 2000;
Sameroff, 1995). Guided by this approach, researchers
examine the ways in which risk and protective factors
interact with one another across and within proximal
social contexts and their reciprocal patterns of the
association with adolescent sexual risk behavior over
time.
Findings from previous research demonstrate that
quality of the parent­child relationship, parent­child
communication, and peer support represent interacting
social systems that are related to adolescent sexual risk
behavior. The role of support within the family has been
widely examined in relation to adolescent sexual risk.
Adolescents who report higher levels of connectedness
with parents have lower rates of unprotected sexual
intercourse (Crosby et al., 2001; Hutchinson, Jemmott,
Jemmott, Braverman, & Fong, 2003), engage in sexual
intercourse with fewer partners (Crosby et al., 2001;
Voisin, 2002) are older at first sexual intercourse (Miller,
Norton, Fan, & Christopherson, 1998) and make safer
sexual decisions overall (Perrino, Gonzalez-Soldevilla,
Pantin, & Szopacznik, 2000; Resnick et al., 1997).
Communication with adolescents about sex appears
to be another important aspect of the parent­child
relationship pertaining to adolescent sexual risk taking
and is a research area that has received much attention.
For example, parent­adolescent communication about
sex is related to adolescents asking their partners about
sexually transmitted diseases as well as number of inti-
mate partners (Hutchinson & Cooney, 1998). Female
adolescents' decision-making about sex appears to be
particularly influenced by parent communication about
sex (Werner-Wilson, 1998), although less communica-
tion has been also linked to more conservative female
attitudes about sex (Somers & Paulson, 2000).
The pattern of adolescent risk becomes even more
complex once the effects of the peer group on risk
behaviors are considered. Peers become important
behavioral referents in adolescence, and much research
has documented the similarities in levels of risk behav-
ior within peer groups (e.g., Boyer, Tschann, & Shafer,
1999; Henrich, Kuperminc, Sack, Blatt, & Leadbeater,
2000; Romer et al., 1994). Further, the impacts of par-
ents and peers are interactively related as demonstrated
by research findings that adolescents' sexual behaviors are
more closely aligned with peer norms if adolescents
have not discussed sex or condoms with their parents
(Whitaker & Miller, 2000).
Although supportive friendships have been associ-
ated with fewer sexual partners (Rotherbaum-Borus,
Reid, & Rosario, 1994), research on another facet of
adolescent risk, substance use, suggests that support
from friends may operate differentially depending on
social context. Supportive friendships have been related
to elevated levels of adolescent substance use, especially
when peers exhibit high levels of substance use (Wills &
Vaughan, 1989; Wills, Mariani & Filer, 1996). Addition-
ally, supportive friendships were more strongly related to
higher levels of substance among adolescents who reported
low levels of parent support (Wills & Vaughan, 1989).
Such interactions between the parent and peer
contexts suggest that examining only one proximal
source of supportive relationships may not elucidate the
whole story of social influences on adolescent risk behavior.
Examining the family­peer mesosystem [i.e., the devel-
opment of behavior across two or more social contexts
(Bronfenbrenner & Crouter, 1983)] may be a more
powerful way to measure supportive relationships' influ-
ences on adolescent risk behavior. It is also important to
investigate the dynamics of social contexts over time to
tease apart effects of stability and change within the family­
peer mesosystem (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998). This
study draws on the ecological literature by examining the
interactive effects of supportive relationships with par-
ents and friends on sexual risk behavior in adolescence.
The transactional perspective emphasizes the influ-
ence that children exert on their social contexts as part
of the cycle leading to the development of problem
behaviors (Sameroff, 1995). For example, children with
behavior problems can negatively influence their par-
ents' parenting styles to be more punitive and coercive,
thus contributing to a vicious cycle of dysfunction
(Petit, Laird, Dodge, Bates, & Criss, 2001). To our
knowledge, no one has investigated transactional effects
of sexual risk behavior in adolescence. However, a key
component of understanding cycles of risk and protection
288 Henrich, Brookmeyer, Shrier, and Shahar
in adolescents' sexual decision-making is to examine
how adolescents' sexual risk behavior is associated with
change in parent­child relationship quality. Much of the
extant research on adolescent sexual risk behavior and
social relationships, although offering promising begin-
nings, is based on cross-sectional data and cannot reveal
the ecological and transactional nature of the develop-
mental processes through which risk and protective
influences are associated with adolescent risk behaviors
(Bronfenbrenner, 1977; Cicchetti & Lynch, 1993; Masten
& Coastworth, 1995; Sameroff, 1995). Therefore, there
is a need for more sophisticated methodology utilizing
longitudinal modeling of complex multivariate designs
to allow for the estimation of bidirectional effects
between supportive relationships and adolescents' sexual
risk as well as the exploration of interactions between
stability and change within a mesosystem. Further,
understanding how baseline sexual risk interacts with
stability and change in the family­peer mesosystem
enhances interpretability of the sexual risk outcome as
being either onset of risk behavior, termination of risk
behavior, or sustained risk behavior (Joiner, 1994).
This study addresses these issues by investigating
the potential protective influences of adolescents' sup-
portive relationships with parents and friends on change
in sexual risk behavior over time. In addition, the study
examines the influence that adolescents engaging in risk
behavior may exert on their relationships with parents
and friends. Longitudinal analyses were conducted by
using data from sexually active adolescents who partici-
pated in the first 2 years of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to address two
sets of main research questions: First, do differing levels
of relationship quality (a) within the family­peer mesos-
ystem and (b) among different facets of the parent­child
relationship interact in their patterns of association with
sexual risk behavior? Second, with the understanding
from a transactional perspective that adolescents' behav-
ior may have an impact on their social relationships, to
what extent are the study's findings reciprocal in that
sexual risk behavior has effects on decreased relation-
ship quality? Moderation by gender and race is included
in the analyses investigating these research questions to
explore whether protective processes operate differentially
for groups experiencing increased risk for contracting HIV.
Method
Participants
Data for this study were taken from the first two waves
of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health), a study of 20,745 adolescents. This sam-
ple included a nationally representative core sample of
12,105 students in grades 7 through 12 at the onset of
the study. Add Health was designed with the under-
standing that families, friends, schools, and communi-
ties play important roles in the lives of adolescents. To
facilitate such analyses, researchers used a clustered
sampling design based around 132 schools to recruit the
nationally representative sample. This sample from 80
schools and 52 middle schools from the United States
was selected with unequal probability of selection.
Incorporating systematic sampling methods and implicit
stratification in the Add Health study design ensured
this sample was representative of US schools with
respect to region of country, urbanicity, school type,
ethnicity, and school size (Bearman, Jones, & Udry, 1997).
This study used a subsample of 2,655 adolescents
(all but three of whom had complete data on all
measures) in the core sample who met the criteria of
(a) participating in both waves, (b) reporting sexual
activity at Wave 1, and (c) being at least 15 years old at
Wave 1 because many sexual questions were asked only
to participants age 15 and older. The median age of the
subsample was 17 years. It was split roughly equally by
gender (49% female) and 12% of the sample reported
being of Hispanic ethnicity. The sample was 64.1%
White (including Hispanic), 28.1% African-American,
2.8% Asian, and 4% American Indian.
Measures and Procedure
In 1995 (Wave 1), adolescents were administered an
extensive survey during in-home interviews, and their
parents completed a questionnaire. In 1996 (Wave 2),
adolescents were administered the in-home survey a sec-
ond time. In the interview, adolescents were asked about
their relationships with family and friends, and they
were asked about their participation in an array of sex-
ual risk behaviors. For questions about sensitive and
illegal behaviors, adolescents directly entered their
responses into interviewers' laptops, with the screen facing
away from the interviewer (Blum, Ireland, & Blum, 2003).
Parent­Child Relationship
Add Health includes an 11-item parent connectedness
scale (Sieving et al., 2001) for which adolescents
reported on the quality of their relationships with their
parents and the extent to which their parents care about
and support them. Sample items include, "how close do
you feel to your mother/father?" and "most of the time
your mother/father is warm and loving toward you."
Adolescents responded to items on a 5-point scales from
"not at all" to "very much," and from "strongly disagree"
Supportive Relationships and Sexual Risk 289
to "strongly agree." Items were averaged into a scale
with good internal consistency,  = .87, in both waves.
Mother­Child Communication About Sex
A subsample of 2,230 adolescents (84%) had parent
report data available from the first wave of the Add
Health study. [The subsample of adolescents with parent
report reported higher levels of supportive relationship
variables, multivariate F(2, 2652) = 3.96, p = .02.] The
parent questionnaire included six items tapping the
extent to which parents discussed sex with their ado-
lescent. Items including talking about birth control, sex,
the negative things that would happen if the adolescent
got/got somebody pregnant, the dangers of getting a sex-
ually transmitted disease, the negative impact on the
adolescent's social life from losing the respect of others,
and the moral issues of not having sex. Parents
answered each question on a 4-point scale from 1, "not
at all," to 4, "a great deal." These items were averaged in
an internally consistent scale of parent­child communi-
cation about sex,  = .89. Ninety-six percent of parents
completing the questionnaire were mothers (91% = bio-
logical, step, or foster mothers) or other female caregiv-
ers (4%; e.g., grandmother or aunt). The remaining 4%
were fathers or other male relatives. Because of the vast
majority of respondents being mothers or other female
caregivers, the 4% of male respondents were excluded
from the analyses, and the scale was named mother­child
communication about sex.
Supportive Friendships
Adolescents reported on five items assessing the frequency
with which they had spent time, talked, and discussed
their problems with their closest male and female
friends. Adolescents indicated whether they had
engaged in each of these activities with each friend in
the past 7 days. Measures derived from these items have
been found to be related to adolescent academic adjust-
ment (Crosnoe & Elder, 2004). When the five items for
closest male friend and the five items for closest female
friend were averaged (and then multiplied by 5 to be on
the same metric as parent connectedness), they formed a
10-item scale assessing frequency of support from clos-
est friends with borderline internal consistency ( = .68
in Wave 1;  = .66 in Wave 2).
Sexual Risk Behavior
Five behaviors considered sexual risks at each wave of
measurement were summed to form a sexual risk behav-
ior index for each wave. The five risks at Wave 1 were
never used a condom (10%), drinking during either first
or most recent sex (15.5%), using drugs during either
first or most recent sex (7.9%), ever has sex for drugs or
money (2.5%), and early onset of sexual activity [<13
years old, 11.6% (age from the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
Brener et al., 2002)]. The five risks at Wave 2 were have
not used a condom in past year (4.3%), drinking during
most recent sex (10.7%), using drugs during most
recent sex (7.4%), sex for drugs or money (3.5%), and
ever had anal sex (15.2%). At Wave 1, 63.1% of the sam-
ple reported no sexual risk behaviors, 28.2% reported
one risk, and 8.7% reported multiple risks. At Wave 2,
68.4% reported no sexual risk behaviors, 24.2% reported
one risk, and 7.5% reported multiple risks. Because most
adolescents reported no sexual risk behaviors in both
waves and a very few reported multiple risks, sexual risk
behavior was treated as a binary variable in the analyses
(0, "no risks"; 1, "at least one risk").
Results
Representativeness of Sample
Initial analyses were conducted to compare our sample
of 2,755 adolescents who reported sexual activity with
all adolescents age 15 years and older in Add Health's
core sample. Our sample was older (M = 16.71, SD = 1.10,
compared to M = 16.38), t(2754) = 15.80, p < .001, and
had a higher proportion of males, 2(1) = 1332.84, p < .001
and African-Americans, 2(1) = 99.58, p < .001, and a
lower proportion of Whites, 2(1) = 35.37, p < .001 and
Asians, 2(1) = 15.36, p < .001. There were no other
racial or ethnic differences between the sexually active
sample and the core sample. Because of differences in
age, gender, and race, these demographic variables were
controlled for in all analyses. Moderation by gender and
race was also included in the analyses (Steinberg &
Fletcher, 1998).
Descriptive Statistics
Means, standard deviations, and correlations among
variables are presented in Table I. Parent connectedness
and supportive friendships were not correlated with one
another at either wave, nor were they correlated across
waves. Parent connectedness was negatively correlated
with sexual risk at both waves. Supportive friendships at
Wave 2 were slightly negatively correlated with sexual
risk at Wave 1. There were also many gender differ-
ences. Girls reported slightly more supportive friend-
ships and less parent connectedness than did boys at
both waves of measurement. More boys reported engag-
ing in sexual risk behavior at Wave 1, but there were no
gender differences in sexual risk at Wave 2. There were
290 Henrich, Brookmeyer, Shrier, and Shahar
also some racial differences. African-American adoles-
cents in the sample were younger, reported less supportive
friendships at both waves of measurement, reported
higher levels of parent connectedness at both waves of
measurement, and were less likely to engage in sexual
risk behavior at Wave 2.
Regression Analyses
Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test this
study's ecological and transactional hypothesis. In all
analyses, missing data were dealt with through list-wise
deletion. The ecological analyses employed logistic
regression because sexual risk behavior was operational-
ized as a binary outcome. In the first step of these analyses,
Wave 1 sexual risk, age, gender, and a race dummy code
(1, "African-American") were entered. In the second step,
Wave 1 parent connectedness and supportive friendships
were entered. Thus, this step represents the traditional
way to test direct effects in longitudinal analyses (Davis,
1985). In the third step, Wave 2 parent connectedness
and supportive friendships were entered. Thus, in this
step, Wave 2 supportive relationships can be interpreted
as change in relationship supportiveness over time,
whereas the Wave 1 variables become stable in supportive
relationships over time.
In subsequent steps, interactions between supportive
relationships and baseline risk and among the relation-
ship variables were examined. This comparative analysis
of interaction effects between two social contexts (par-
ent connectedness and supportive friendships) is an
established way to operationalize Bronfenbrenner's
conceptualization of the mesosystem (Bronfenbrenner,
1977; Bronfenbrenner & Crouter, 1983), and the inclu-
sion of supportive relationship data from both waves of
measurement allows for the assessment of stability
versus change within the family­peer mesosystem
(Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998). The fifth step
included the following two­way interactions: Wave 1
supportive friendships × Wave 1 parent connectedness
(i.e., mesosytem stability); Wave 2 supportive friendship
× Wave 2 parent connectedness (i.e., mesosytem
change); Wave 1 supportive friendship × Wave 2 parent
connectedness and Wave 1 parent connectedness ×
Wave 2 supportive friendships (i.e., interactions among
stability and change in the mesosystem); and Wave 1
sexual risk × Wave 1 parent connectedness, Wave 1 sex-
ual risk × Wave 2 parent connectedness, Wave 1 sexual
risk × Wave 1 supportive friendships, and Wave 1 sexual
risk × Wave 2 supportive friendships [i.e., interactions
with baseline risk to clarify the interpretation of the out-
come effects (Joiner, 1994)]. In the sixth step, two-way
supportive relationships × gender and relationships­race
interactions were entered to explore for gender and racial
differences. The final step in the model consisted of two
three­way interactions designed to test whether relation-
ship quality in one context further moderated any interac-
tions between sexual risk at Wave 1 and change over time
in relationship quality in the other context. These two
interactions were sexual risk at Wave 1 × supportive
friendships at Wave 1 × parent connectedness at Wave 2
and sexual risk at Wave 1 × parent connectedness at
Wave 1 × supportive friendships at Wave 2.
Table II summarizes the estimates from the final
model, which includes the interaction terms. In the
presence of interaction terms, main effects become diffi-
cult to interpret (Aiken & West, 1991), so in the text,
the main effect estimates are presented from the first
three steps when they were first entered into the model,
noting whether each was maintained in the presence of
the subsequently entered interaction terms.
In the first step, adolescents who reported sexual
risk behavior at Wave 1 had higher odds reporting sex-
ual risk behavior at Wave 2, B = 0.61, SE = 0.09,
p < .001, odds ratio = 1.78. Older adolescents also had

higher odds of reporting sexual risk behavior at Wave 2,
B = 0.14, SE = 0.04, p < .001, odds ratio = 1.15. African-
Americans had lower odds of reporting sexual risk
behavior at Wave 2, B = ­0.30, SE = 0.10, p = .002, odds
ratio = 0.74. There was no main effect of gender. As can
be seen in Table II, these effects were maintained in the
final step of the hierarchical regression, which included
interaction terms.
At initial entry in step 2, adolescents reporting
higher levels of parent connectedness at Wave 1 were
less likely to engage in sexual risk behavior at Wave 2,
B = ­0.17, SE = 0.07, p = .008, odds ratio = 0.84. There
was no effect of supportive friendships. As can be seen
in Table II, the main effect of parent connectedness at
Wave 1 was not maintained in the presence of the inter-
action terms, suggesting that it was conditional upon the
levels of other independent variables. At initial entry in
step 3, adolescents who reported increased levels of par-
ent connectedness over time were less likely to engage in
sexual risk behavior at Wave 2, B = ­0.23, SE = 0.08,
p = .004, odds ratio = 0.80. As can be seen in Table II,
the main effect of parent connectedness at Wave 1 was
not maintained in the presence of the interaction terms,
suggesting that its effects were conditional upon the lev-
els of other independent variables.
Of the block of two­way interactions between sup-
portive relations within and across time and between
Wave 1 sexual risk and each supportive relationship, the
Wave 1 supportive friendships × Wave 2 parent con-
nectedness interaction was significant. The results from
this step are presented in Table II. None of the gender or
race interactions added in step 5, 2(10) = 5.88, p = .83,
or either of the two three­way interactions added in step
6,  2(2) = 3.42, p = .18, reached significance, so these
two steps were deleted from the analyses presented in
Table II.
To probe the two-way Wave 1 supportive friendships ×
Wave 2 parent connectedness interaction, two sets of
analyses were conducted. The first examined the effects
of change in parent connectedness after controlling for
Wave 1 risk, age, gender, and race, separately for adoles-
cents who reported low versus highly supportive friend-
ships at Wave 1 (based on a median split). Increases in
parent support at Wave 2 were only associated with
Wave 2 sexual risk for adolescents who also reported
highly supportive friendships at Wave 1, B = ­0.45,
SE = 0.12, p < .001, odd ratio = 0.64. For adolescents
who reported low supportive friendships at Wave 1,
there was no effect of increases in parent support on sex-
ual risk, B = ­0.09, SE = 0.10, p = .38. To test whether
change in parent connectedness in turn moderated the
effects of supportive friendships in this interaction,
researchers subdivided the sample based on whether
adolescents reported increased or decreased parent con-
nectedness over time. There were no effects of Wave 1
supportive friendship under either condition.

SD = 0.71) than with their sons (M = 2.96, SD = 0.83),
t(2185) = 9.34, p < .001. Mother­child communication
about sex had a small positive correlation with parent
connectedness at Wave 1, r = .05, p = .02.
Regressions
A four-step hierarchical logistic regression was conducted
to test whether mother­child communication would
interact with parent connectedness such that communi-
cation had more protective power in the context of high
levels of parent connectedness. Wave 2 sexual risk was
regressed on Wave 1 sexual risk, age, gender, and race in
the first step. The main effects of Wave 1 parent con-
nectedness and Wave 1 mother­child communication
about sex were added in the second step. The third step
included the two­way interactions of: parent connected-
ness × sexual risk, mother­child communication × sexual
risk, and parent connectedness × mother­child commu-
nication, plus parent connectedness × gender, parent
connectedness × race, mother­child communication ×
gender, and mother­child communication × race. The
final step included a three­way interaction between
sexual risk behavior, parent connectedness, and
mother­child communication. In this set of analyses,
only Wave 1 predictors were considered because par-
ent­child communication was not assessed in Wave 2 of
Add Health. As with the previous set of regressions,
estimates from the final step are presented in Table III,
whereas main effect estimates from step of initial entry
are presented in the text.
There were no initial main effects of parent connect-
edness, B = ­0.12, SE = 0.08, p = .11, or mother­child
communication, B = ­0.03, SE = 0.06, p = .68, and there
was no interaction between the two variables (Table III).
However, there were interactions of each of the parent
variables with gender (Table III). To probe these gender
interactions, analyses were run separately for boys and
girls. Among girls, both parent connectedness and
mother­child communication at Wave 1 were associated
with reduced odds of sexual risk behavior at Wave 2 (for
parent connectedness, B = ­0.25, SE = 0.10, p = .01, odds
ratio = 0.78; for mother­child communication, B = ­0.26,
SE = 0.09, p = .005, odds ratio = 0.77). Among boys, nei-
ther parent variable was associated with Wave 2 sexual
risk (B = 0.08, SE = 0.12, p = .52 for parent connected-
ness; B = 0.15, SE = 0.08, p = .07 for mother­child
communication). None of the other two­way interaction
terms was significant. The three­way interaction was
also not significant, 2(1) = 1.34, p = .25, so its step was
not included in Table III.
Examination of Transactional Effects
The final set of analyses tested the extent to which the
longitudinal associations between supportive relation-
ships and sexual risk behavior were reciprocal such that
sexual risk behavior has effects on decreased relation-
ship quality. Hierarchical linear regressions were con-
ducted in which each social relationship variable at
Wave 2 (parent connectedness and supportive friend-
ships) was regressed on its Wave 1 levels, age, gender,
race, and Wave 1 sexual risk in the first step. Wave 2
sexual risk was entered in the second step. The third
step included two­way interactions: Wave 1 sexual risk ×
Wave 1 relationship and Wave 2 sexual risk × Wave 1
relationship, plus exploratory interactions of gender and

race with sexual risk behavior. The results are presented
in Table IV.
The regressions explained 36% of the variance in
Wave 2 parent connectedness and 14% of the variance in
Wave 2 supportive friendships. When initially entered,
sexual risk behavior at Wave 1 had small negative effects
on both parent connectedness and supportive friend-
ships at Wave 2, B = ­0.06, SE = 0.02, p = .006, and B =
­0.12, SE = 0.04, p = .007, respectively, indicating that
adolescents reporting sexual risk behavior at Wave 1
experienced slight relative decreases in supportive rela-
tionships over time. Additionally, African-American
adolescents reported a statistically significant decrease
in supportive friendships, B = ­0.31, SE = 0.05, p < .001.
In step 2, sexual risk at Wave 2 had a negative effect on
Wave 2 parent connectedness, above and beyond the
effects of sexual risk at Wave 1 (Table IV). There was no
effect of sexual risk at Wave 2 on supportive friendships.
There were no interactive effects of sexual risk on parent
connectedness, R2 = .001, p = .49, or supportive friend-
ships, R2 = .001, p = .49. Thus, the interactions were
not included in Table IV.
Discussion
This study examined protective processes associated
with sexual risk behavior within the family­peer mesos-
ystem and over time transactionally. Our findings
underscore one of the ecological perspective's main
tenets, which is that in psychological research, interac-
tions are often more telling than are main effects
(Bronfenbrenner, 1977). Findings revealed interactions
within the family­peer mesosystem as well as transac-
tional effects of sexual risk on levels of supportive rela-
tionships, suggesting that supportive relationships and
sexual risk behavior in adolescence are dynamically
interwoven.
Parent connectedness and supportive friendships
interacted to predict reduced likelihood of sexual risk
behavior. Increased parent connectedness over the
course of the study was only associated with low sexual
risk for adolescents who also reported stable, highly
supportive friendships over the two waves. For these
adolescents, increases in parent connectedness were
associated with a sizable decrease in the odds of adoles-
cents engaging in sexual risk behavior over time. Thus,
although supportive friendships had no main effects on
sexual risk, they assisted in decreasing risk by enhancing
the protective effects of increased parent connectedness.
This finding adds to other recent research documenting
the importance of supportive relationships within the
family­peer mesosystem as protective factors for adoles-
cent adjustment (Crosnoe & Elder, 2004; Scholte, van
Lieshout, & van Aken, 2001). Additionally, in the sub-
sample with mother-report data, girls with high initial
levels of both parent connectedness and mother­child
communication were less likely to engage in sexual risk
behavior over time. These effects did not hold for boys.
However, these gender differences may be because the
subsample was limited to parent-report data, suggesting
that, in those households, mothers may have been the
primary caregivers. Previous literature has found that
mother­daughter communication around sexual prac-
tices is linked to females' safer sexual decision-making
(Werner-Wilson, 1998), including greater lifetime
condom use (Miller, Levin, Whitaker, & Xu, 1998).
Implications of these findings are that parents play
an important role in whether their adolescents engage in
sexual risk behavior (Dittus et al., 2004), but that to
fully understand this role, multiple facets of parenting
and the social contexts of parenting in conjunction with
gender and adolescents' peers must be taken into con-
sideration. Further, the association between sexual risk
behavior and supportive relationships in adolescence
has transactional elements. Adolescents who reported
engaging in sexual risk behavior at the onset of the study
reported small decreases in the quality of their relation-
ships with parents and friends over the course of the
Table IV. Effects of Sexual Risk Behavior on Supportive Relationships at Wave 2 (N = 2,652)

study. This finding is consistent with Action Theory for-
mulations (Brandtstadter & Lerner, 1999), as well as
empirical research (e.g., Lopez & Little, 1996; Shahar,
Henrich, Blatt, Ryan, & Little, 2003) indicating that
children and adolescents can play a role in generating
the very social conditions that play a role in their
adverse developmental outcomes.
Another implication of this study is that the interac-
tive effects of parent connectedness and supportive
friendships appeared to be equally useful for both the
prevention and reduction of risk. Additionally, no mod-
eration by race was found for the effects of parents and
friends. Further, the African-American adolescents in
the sample reported higher feelings of parental connect-
edness (although lower levels of supportive friendships)
and were at lower risk of engagement in sexual risk
behavior. So, even though African-American adolescents
were more likely to report being sexually active, they
were also more likely to engage in safe sexual practices.
The transactional model (Sameroff, 1995) further
elucidates numerous points of intervention within the
parent­child relationship to reduce sexual risk. For
optimal effectiveness, interventions should take into
account children's effects on parents, as well as parents'
effects on their children. For example, an intervention
can directly target remediation efforts at adolescent
behavior (e.g., sexual risk taking) and parental interpre-
tations of this behavior (e.g., that the adolescent is a
"bad kid" because his/her behavior defies parental val-
ues) in addition to parents' behavior itself. Such multifo-
cused interventions may have more power to reduce
adolescent sexual risk behavior.
Although our findings underscore the importance of
taking an ecological­transactional approach in studying
supportive relationships and sexual risk behavior in
adolescence, they only begin to illuminate the full power
of such an approach. From an ecological standpoint, a
host of other contexts, including socioeconomic status,
neighborhood collective efficacy, school outreach, and
community health policies, could potentially interact
with the effects of parents and peers in relation to ado-
lescent sexual risk and are the focus of continuing
research. Further, because AIDS is a worldwide pandemic,
cultural and policy level influences [i.e., Bronfenbrenner's
(1977) macrosystem] may also be critical in understand-
ing how families can help prevent sexual risk behavior
among adolescents.
The study's ability to make conclusions about the
transactional nature of causality is limited by its correla-
tional design and two time points of measurement.
Multiple waves of measurement are necessary to more
completely and reliably characterize transactional develop-
mental effects (McArdle, 2001; Sameroff, 1995). Still,
given the cross-sectional nature of much of the extant lit-
erature in the field, this study's longitudinal design repre-
sents an important step toward more fully transactional
models. Another avenue for future research is an increased
understanding of the mechanisms through which support-
ive relationships are associated with reduced sexual risk.
Possible mediators include adolescent attitudes, self-
esteem, and education pertaining to sex as well as their
general psychosocial adjustment (Dittus et al., 2004).
Finally, our conclusions are tempered by limitations
in the Add Health measures. All constructs in this study,
except gender and parent­child communication, are
adolescent self-report, which can be biased on items
pertaining to sensitive and illegal behavior, in spite of
the privacy precautions taken by interviewers. Also, the
parent and friendship questions in Add Health are not
based on established measures, to our knowledge. How-
ever, they have been validated in prior research with the
data set (Crosnoe & Elder, 2004; Resnick et al., 1997).
Further, most parent respondents were mothers, so it
was not possible to compare the gender differences
found pertaining to mother­child communication with
those of father­child communication about sex, which
may be more important for boys and is another potential
avenue for further research.
Despite these limitations, this study demonstrates
how supportive parenting and supportive friendships
can interact to prevent and mitigate adolescent sexual
risk behavior. HIV infection is a widespread, persistent,
and deadly threat to the health of youths and adults
worldwide. Continuing basic and applied research draw-
ing from theoretical approaches that appreciate the com-
plexities of human development is imperative to stem
youth contraction of HIV/AIDS.
