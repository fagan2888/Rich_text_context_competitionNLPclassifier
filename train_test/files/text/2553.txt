AGROWING literature suggests that parents do not stop
providing assistance to their adult children when they
reach maturity or when they establish their own households
(Hogan & Eggebeen, 1995; Schoeni & Ross, 2005). Instead,
exchanges of various types of support are common and
continue over the life course of both parents and children
(Spitze & Logan, 1992). Continuing support may play a
particularly important role in midlife and old age. Older
parents who begin to have difficulties in everyday function-
ing may benefit from emotional and practical help from
their children (Krause, 1986; Silverstein & Bengtson,
1994), whereas their middle-aged children may still
welcome support and advice from parents, and, on occasion,
financial help (Cooney & Uhlenberg, 1992; Suitor, Pille-
mer, & Sechrist, 2006).
Much of the literature on intergenerational exchanges has
relied on reports from a single family member, either a
middle-aged adult or aging parent (Bianchi, Evans, Hotz,
McGarry, & Seltzer, 2007). Assessments of multiple per-
spectives may provide a more comprehensive picture of
intergenerational exchanges and their implications for the
well-being of family members (Freedman, Wolf, Soldo, &
Stephen, 1991). Multiple informants, however, often do not
agree when reporting on their intergenerational support
exchanges (Klein Ikkink, van Tilburg, & Knipscheer, 1999;
Rossi & Rossi, 1990). Although the observed discrepancies
in these reports may be regarded as random error, discrep-
ant reports of the same events are a meaningful feature of
family relationships and interactions (Cox & Paley, 1997).
In particular, differences in perspectives on how much sup-
port is given and received could become a source of strain
in the relationship and jeopardize future exchanges. Only a
few papers, however, have systematically examined factors
that might account for these discrepancies (Lin, 2008;
Mandemakers & Dykstra, 2008; Shapiro, 2004).
The present study examined predictors of discrepancies
in reports of support exchanged between middle-aged adults
and their parents. We obtained independent reports of support
exchanged from middle-aged adults (aged 40­60 years) and
their parents (aged 59­96 years). We considered total support
as well as exchanges of five specific types of support (emo-
tional, practical assistance, listening to talk about one's day,
advice, and financial). We investigated reports on both
downward exchanges (support given by parent and received
by child) and upward exchanges (support received by
parent and given by child). The study focused on two ques-
tions: (a) What is the level and direction of discrepancy in
parents' and children's reports about support exchanges?
and (b) What predictors explain discrepancies in reports
about the frequency of support exchanges?

Objectives. This study investigated predictors of discrepancies in reports of 5 types of support that aging parents
and their middle-aged children exchanged with one another. Predictors included structural factors, including needs and
resources and dyadic characteristics, and psychological factors, including family obligation and investment in the
relationship.
Methods. Participants included 337 dyads of parents (aged 59­96 years) and their children (aged 40­60 years).
Multilevel models assessed the level of discrepancies between dyadic members and examined predictors accounting for
the discrepancies. We considered downward (from parent to child) and upward (from child to parent) directions in support
exchanges.
Results. For upward support from adult children to their parents, children reported that they gave more than their aging
parents reported receiving. For downward support from parents to children, the results differed depending on the type of
support. Discrepancies between parents' and children's reports were associated with parents' feelings of obligation
toward children and children's ratings of the importance of parent­child relationship.
Discussion. These results suggest the importance of considering multiple perspectives and the direction of exchanges
between generations. Discrepancies in reports of support reflect both self-enhancement and family context and may be an
important source of misunderstanding and conflict between generations.
Key Words: Discrepancy--Dyadic reports--Intergenerational exchanges--Social support.

Discrepancies in Reports of Support Exchanges
Between Parents and Their Adult Children
Our view of discrepancies is drawn from the social
psychological literature on self-enhancement (Krueger, 1998;
Taylor & Brown, 1988) and from a family systems perspec-
tive that posits that structural and psychological features of
family relationships will contribute to discrepancies (Cox &
Paley, 1997). Self-enhancement theory suggests that people
will generally view their own actions in a more positive light
than others' actions. As applied to exchanges between
parents and children, self-enhancement theory suggests that
each generation would report more support given and less
support received than the other generation. We do not know,
however, if the discrepancies are due to distortions in the
reports of one or both persons, but only that the direction of
discrepancies is consistent with self-enhancement. These
trends toward self-enhancement, however, may be modified
by specific family contexts and relationships.
Prior research has found discrepancies between parent
and child reports about contact and exchanges of assistance
(Giarrusso, Stallings, & Bengtson, 1995; Rossi & Rossi,
1990; Shapiro, 2004). Many of these studies on discrepan-
cies, however, only assessed whether each person reported
giving help or not but did not take into account the amount
or frequency of support or the degree of discrepancy in
support (Lin, 2008; Roan, Hermalin, & Ofstedal, 1996;
Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Shapiro, 2004).
Another limitation of prior work is a focus on one direc-
tion of exchange, mainly support given by children to an
aging parent (Lin, 2008; Roan et al., 1996). We know that
support between generations flows in both directions
(Spitze & Logan, 1992; Zarit & Eggebeen, 2002). Support
exchanges between parents and children can have different
meanings and consequences depending on the direction of
help. In upward exchanges, most studies have found that
middle-aged children tend to report giving more support to
parents than their parents reported receiving, especially
instrumental support (Klein Ikkink et al., 1999; Lin, 2008;
Mandemakers & Dykstra, 2008; Roan et al., 1996; Rossi &
Rossi, 1990; Shapiro, 2004). For downward exchanges,
prior studies have shown mixed results. Mandemakers and
Dykstra found that parents report giving more support than
children report receiving, regardless of the type of support.
In contrast, Shapiro reported that children tended to report
giving and receiving more instrumental support (e.g.,
housework, help with errands) than parents reported, and
parents tended to report giving and receiving more
emotional support than children reported. Thus, in explaining
discrepancies, Shapiro emphasized the type of support
exchanged (instrumental or emotional support), rather than
the direction of exchanges.
The first objective of this study was to look at whether
there are discrepancies in reports of specific types of
exchanges at the dyadic level, both for upward and down-
ward exchanges. Drawing from family systems theory that
suggests each person in a family has a different perspective
on events and processes, we hypothesized that there would
be significant discrepancies in reports of support given and
received by parents and their adult children. Based on self-
enhancement theory, we expected that both parents and
children will report giving more support than the other
person reports receiving. As some prior empirical work has
found that the amount and direction of discrepancies vary
depending on type of support (Shapiro, 2004), we also
explored individual types of support as well as overall
support. Certain types of support (e.g., financial) may have
more saliency in the family relationship and may be more
likely to produce discrepancies between giver and receiver.
Possible Sources of Discrepancies in Parents'
and Children's Reports
Although studies have reported discrepancies in re-
ports of support exchanges between generations (Giarrusso
et al., 1995; Rossi & Rossi, 1990), relatively few studies have
examined predictors of discrepancies in reports of support
exchanges in a multivariate framework. Lin (2008) and
Shapiro (2004) focused on structural characteristics (e.g.,
income and health) as predictors of discrepancies. Mande-
makers and Dykstra (2008) is the only prior study examining
psychological factors (e.g., obligation, relationship quality,
and dissatisfaction with support) as predictors of discrepan-
cies between generations. In the present study, we focused
on four dimensions of the parent­child relationship to exam-
ine discrepant reports of exchanges between middle-aged
children and aging parents. These factors include structural
factors (e.g., individuals' needs and resources and dyadic
characteristics) and psychological factors (e.g., filial and
parental obligation and investment in the relationship). We
selected these factors based on prior findings and because
they potentially affect how people view these exchanges.
Needs and Resources of Aging Parents and Middle-Aged
Children
Needs and resources are the main determinants of the
amount of intergenerational support (Davey, Janke, &
Savla, 2004; Eggebeen & Davey, 1998), and they may also
lead to different perceptions of intergenerational exchanges
between generations. When one generation has fewer
economic and social resources than the other, the imbalance
may affect perceptions of support exchanges between
generations (Giarrusso et al., 1995; Lin, 2008; Shapiro, 2004).
Prior studies have shown that aging parents who have a
greater need for assistance may underestimate the amount
of help received to protect their self-concepts from a feeling
of dependency (Lyons, Zarit, Sayer, & Whitlatch, 2002;
Walker, Pratt, Martell, & Martin, 1991; Zweibel & Lydens,
1990). Conversely, as children are called upon to give more
help to aging parents, it may seem that they are providing
more assistance than they actually are. Given norms about
DISCREPANCIES IN REPORTS OF SUPPORT EXCHANGES 529
filial obligation, some adult children with limited resources
(e.g., time and money) or competing demands (e.g., chil-
dren with special needs) may overestimate how much they
actually give as a way of avoiding feelings of guilt about not
giving more (Lin, 2008).
Following the work of Lin (2008) and Shapiro (2004), we
estimated needs and resources from social structural char-
acteristics of both parties, including age, education, income,
health, and marital status. Persons with more education,
higher income, and who are in better health will potentially
be able to give more assistance and help, whereas those
with lower levels of education, income, and health will have
greater needs for support from their parent or child. Simi-
larly, having a spouse indicates another resource, whereas
not having a spouse would be associated with potentially
greater needs for assistance or fewer resources for provid-
ing help. Finally age in the older generation is likely to be
associated with greater needs and lower resources.
The Parent­Child Dyadic Characteristics: Gender and
Proximity
When a parent and child are the same gender, their
perceptions of intergenerational exchanges may be more
similar (Davey et al., 2004; Shapiro, 2004). A parent and
child of the same gender tend to spend more time with one
another either in person or by telephone or e-mail, and this
may be particularly true of mothers and daughters (Coward
& Dwyer, 1990; Fingerman, 2001; Rossi & Rossi, 1990).
This increased time may lead to greater congruence in
reports of intergenerational exchanges (Burton & Blair, 1991).
In addition, proximity of parents and children and sharing
the same household can provide more opportunities for
shared perceptions of exchanges (Shapiro, 2004). We would
expect reports of coresident dyads and of dyads who live in
closer proximity but do not live together to have greater
congruence in their reports. The exception may be financial
support, which can become blurred in a shared household.
Norms of Family Obligation
Norms of family obligation are culturally defined rights
and duties that specify the ways in which family members
are expected to behave toward each other (Gans & Silver-
stein, 2006; Rossi & Rossi, 1990). When parental or filial
obligations are strong, individuals are more likely to present
a culturally desirable response to questions about exchanges
of support. Thus, they may report that they are receiving
more from or giving more to their dyadic partner. Using
data from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study, Mande-
makers and Dykstra (2008) showed that parents' family
obligations were a strong predictor of discrepancies for
both upward and downward exchanges, whereas children's
filial obligations were not associated with discrepancies for
either direction. Given that norms of family obligation can
change over the adult life span, across historical time, and
across cultures (Gans & Silverstein, 2006; Rossi & Rossi,
1990), use of a data set from the United States, focusing on
specific life stages, (e.g., offspring in midlife and parents in
old age) may bring different results. Specifically, because
we focused on parent­child dyads in later years, we expected
that children's filial obligation toward aging parents would
also show a significant effect on discrepancies.
Investment in the Relationship
The investment or importance that parents and their chil-
dren place on their relationship may affect perceptions of
support given and received. Investment represents a psycho-
logical dimension drawn from role centrality theory that
holds that events in roles that are more salient are more
likely to affect self-esteem (Gurin, Veroff, & Feld, 1960;
Martire, Stephens, & Townsend, 2000). Likewise, events in
central roles may be perceived in a more self-enhancing
way. Thus, we would expect that higher ratings of the
importance of the relationship would be associated with
greater discrepancies in reported support.
The concept of investment in the relationship is related to
the generational stake hypothesis (Bengtson & Kuypers,
1971; Giarrusso, Feng, & Bengtson, 2005). Parents value
their relationships with children more highly than do their
children and thus may overreport both the help they give to
and receive from children. Studies based on this hypothesis,
however, have assumed that each generation has a different
stake in the relationship, rather than directly measuring that
stake (Bianchi et al., 2007; Giarrusso et al., 1995). In the
current study, we used a direct measure of the importance of
the relationship to each generation to provide a better test of
the hypothesis (Fingerman, Chen, Hay, Cichy, & Lefkowitz,
2006). We expected that individuals who view the relation-
ship as more important would report more support they are
providing and receiving. Because parents are typically more
invested in the tie than offspring, we expected parents to
show this pattern more than offspring.
In sum, this study examined the level and direction of
discrepancies in reports of support exchanges between
middle-aged children and aging parents at the dyadic level,
both for upward and downward flow. We also examined
predictors of the discrepancies in the reports about exchanges.
Based on the previous literature, as well as self-enhancement
and family systems perspectives, we expected that parents'
and children's needs and resources, dyadic characteristics,
norms of family obligation, and investment in the relation-
ship would explain discrepancies in their reports of support
exchanges.
Method
Sample
This analysis is based on data from "The Family Exchanges
Study" (Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, & Zarit, 2009). The first
KIM ET AL.
530
step in the sampling plan was to recruit respondents aged
40­60 years who had at least one living parent and one or
more biological children older than 18 years. Potential
respondents were randomly selected from phone lists from
Genesys Corporation as well as from random digit dialing
from the Philadelphia Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area
(five counties in southeastern Pennsylvania and four coun-
ties in New Jersey; Pennsylvania State Data Center, 2001)
and stratified by gender and age (40­50 and 51­60 years).
People living in Philadelphia county, high-density minority
neighborhoods, and lower income households were overs-
ampled, which resulted in 37% minority participants. Inter-
views were conducted from January through August 2008.
Of the 845 eligible targets, 633 (75%) were interviewed.
The target (middle-aged) participants completed 1-hr-long
computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) and received
$25 for their time. The CATI software allowed for random
order of administration of sections of the interview. The target
participants completed a series of questions for each living
parent, including exchanges of support, beliefs on relation-
ship with parents, and other demographic information.
From the original sample of 633 middle-aged adults, 280
(44%) had parents who also agreed to be interviewed. In
223 cases, one parent was interviewed, and in 57 cases, both
parents were interviewed, which yielded a total of 337
discrete dyads nested within 280 families. We considered
each parent­child dyad as a separate unit because exchanges
between the middle-aged child and his or her mother and
father were measured separately. The aging parents (G1)
were asked a set of questions that were identical to those for
their children (G2). In no instance was the older adult inter-
viewed with his or her child present or vice versa. The
amount of missing data within the sample was quite small,
but in the few instances where items were missing, we used
pair-wise deletion in specific analyses. Table 1 presents in-
dividual characteristics of each parent and middle-aged
child and the dyadic characteristics.
Measures
Support exchanges.--The dependent variable was the
Intergenerational Support Scale (Fingerman et al., 2009),
which assesses how often participants provided and received
five types of support: emotional support, practical assis-
tance, advice, financial support, and listening to talk about
daily events. Four items reflect domains from the Social
Support Resources Index (Vaux, 1988; Vaux & Harrison,
1985), and the fifth, listening to talks about daily events,
was drawn from prior work on intergenerational ties
(Fingerman, 2000). Participants rated how frequently they
provided each type of support to their dyadic partner, and how
frequently they received that type of support on a 8-point
scale: 1 (less than once a year or not at all), 2 (once a year),
3 (a few times a year), 4 (monthly), 5 (a few times a month),
6 (weekly), 7 (a few times a week), and 8 (daily). We summed
scores across the five types of support given (a = .80 for G1
and a = .83 for G2) and received (a = .81 for G1 and a = .81

Predictor Variables
Needs and resources.--Five variables related to needs
and resources were obtained from each parent and child:
age, years of education, income, self-rated health, and marital
status. Participants indicated household income in 2007
on a scale ranging from 1 (less than $10,000) to 6 (more
than $100,000). Self-rated health for the past 12 months
was measured using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (poor)
to 5 (excellent). Because we assumed that respondents
who have spouses have more resources to meet their
needs, marital status was coded 1 for (re)married and 0 for
not-married.
The parent­child dyadic characteristics.--Three variables
were used for dyadic characteristics of parent­child dyads:
gender composition, coresidence, and residential proximity.
Gender composition was categorized into four groups on
the basis of parents' and children's gender: father­son,
father­daughter, mother­son, and mother­daughter. These
categories were dummy coded using mother­daughter as
the reference group. Coresidence is a dichotomous variable
coded 1 for coresident dyads. Residential proximity is the
distance between parents' and non-coresident children's
residences in miles. For coresident dyads, their residential
proximity was coded 0. To address positive skew of dis-
tance, we used a log-linear transformation in analyses.
Family obligation.--Parental obligation (for parents) or
filial obligation (for children) asked how often parents or
children should provide adult children or parents following
six types of support: emotional support, practical assistance,
financial support, listening to the other's talk, socializing, and
advice (Silverstein, Gans, &Yang, 2006). The answers ranged
from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Means of the six items were com-
puted (a = .67 for parents; a = .79 for children). As shown in
Table 1, children's obligation toward parents was significantly
higher than parents' obligation toward children.
Investment in the parent­child relationship.--Partici-
pants rated investment in parent and offspring using a one-
item assessment of the importance of the parent or child
compared with other social partners (Fingerman et al.,
2006, 2009). Ratings were made on a 6-point scale: 6 (most
important person in your life), 5 (among the 3 most impor-
tant), 4 (among the 6 most important), 3 (among the 10 most
important), 2 (among the 20 most important), and 1 (less
important than that). Paired sample t-tests revealed that parents
reported significantly greater importance of relationship
with their child than children did (Table 1).
Analysis Plan
To analyze data at the level of the dyad, we used multilevel
modeling (SAS PROC MIXED, Cary, NC; Littell, Milliken,
Stroup, & Wolfinger, 1996), which accounts for the inter-
dependence of individuals within each dyad or family and
enables researchers to predict both the level of the outcome
and the level and direction of differences in reports of the
outcome within pairs (Maguire, 1999). In a multilevel
model, individual observations of parents and children
(Level 1) are nested within the dyad (Level 2), which is the
unit of analysis. This method has been used to investigate a
number of questions regarding dyadic reports within family
(Barnett, Marchall, Raudenbush, & Brenna, 1993; Lyons
et al., 2002; Willson, Shuey, Elder, & Wickrama, 2006).
Given that some dyads (33.8%) are nested in families
(Level 3), we also considered Level 3 (family level) mod-
els to explain the shared variance of dyads within the same
family.
At Level 1 (within-dyad approach), we used observations
from each dyad member to fit a regression line on an indicator

variable (Generation: G1 or G2). This regression model was
summarized by two parameters: an intercept and a slope. The
intercept represents the mean level of support exchange for
each matched pair (averaged across the dyad members). The
slope captures the degree of discrepancy in the level of sup-
port exchange between the dyad members. We modeled the
individual score (Yijk
) for ith member in the jth dyad in the kth
family as

Y e
which is a function of an intercept (b0jk
, the mean score
across dyads), a slope (b1jk
, the degree of discrepancy
between the pair), and individual-level errors of prediction
(eijk
). (The indicator variable, Generation, was coded -0.5
for parents (G1) and 0.5 for children (G2). This is an
alternative form of dummy coding to 0 and 1 for examin-
ing means and discrepancies between dyad members. The
advantage of coding -0.5 and 0.5 is that the intercept can
represent a mean across dyad members. Also, the slope
represents a discrepancy between dyad members, which is
equivalent to coding of 0 and 1. A negative coefficient for
discrepancy indicates that parents reported higher level of
exchanges than children; a positive coefficient for discrep-
ancy indicates that children reported higher level of
exchanges than parents.) We used an unstructured covari-
ance matrix to specify the random effects. At Level 1, if
the dyadic mean (intercept) and discrepancy (slope) have
significant variance components, it is appropriate to proceed
with a Level 2 model in which predictors can be included
to explain the variation in these parameters (Bryk &
Raudenbush, 1992).
At Level 2 (between-dyads approach), the intercept
(mean score of G1-G2 reports) and slope (discrepancy
between G1-G2 reports) are treated as outcome variables,
which are permitted to vary across dyads. We examined
four groups of predictors (needs and resources of parents
and children, dyadic characteristics, family obligation, and
parent­child relationship importance) to explain the varia-
tion of the intercept and slope coefficients across dyads.
Because we expected that the predictors may be associated
with both mean and discrepancy level of support exchanges,
we included them as the predictors of both the intercept and
the slope.

where the error term (Vp0k

families included two dyads, however, we compared two-

Results
We first present the results of baseline model with only
the indicator variable, Generation (G1 or G2), which esti-
mates the mean level and the average discrepancy of dyadic
reports. Then, we present the results of explanatory models
predicting both the mean level and the discrepancies in reports
of parents and children.
Baseline Model
In the baseline model (Table 3), we examined dyad
discrepancy scores (slopes) in downward and upward
exchanges. The discrepancy score of total support was sig-
nificant in upward exchanges (from G2 to G1), indicating
that children (G2) reported giving more support than parents
(G1) reported receiving. The discrepancy of downward
exchanges (from G1 to G2), however, was not significant,
indicating that parents and offspring generally agreed on the
support that parents provide to children.
Examination of each type of support revealed that all five
discrepancy scores for upward exchanges were positive
scores, and three were significant (emotional support,
listening to other's talk, and financial support), which
means that children consistently reported giving more than
parents reported receiving for all types of support.
Although parents and offspring generally agreed on total
downward support, there were discrepancies in perceptions
of specific types of support, practical assistance and advice.
The discrepancy score for practical assistance was negative
(B = -0.88, p < .001), which means that parents reported
giving more practical assistance than children reported
receiving, whereas the discrepancy score for advice was
positive (B = 0.41, p < .01), indicating parents reported
giving less advice than children reported received.
All the random variance components for the intercepts
and the discrepancy scores were significantly different
from zero (p < .001) at Level 2, indicating that there were
substantial amounts of variability in the mean level and the
dyad discrepancy across parent­child dyads and Level 2
predictors could be added for a further investigation of var-
iations of discrepancy. Next, when family level (Level 3)
was added to the random effects, the variance components
in the mean level and the dyad discrepancy are significant

for family level. Compared to two-level models, the model
fit also improved for both downward (-2 log likelihood =
26.3 (3), p < .001) and upward exchanges (-2 log likeli-
hood = 21.4(3), p < .001). Therefore, for examining the
predictors of discrepancies in reports, we used three-level
models.
Determinants of Discrepancies in Reports of Support
Exchanges
Table 4 presents the results of multilevel regressions with
four sets of variables added to predict: (a) dyadic mean level
of exchanges and (b) discrepancy in parent­child reports of
total support in downward and upward exchanges. Our
interest is how parent and child view the same exchange, so
although we showed findings for both mean levels (inter-
cept) and discrepancies (slope), we focused on predictors of
discrepancies. We also examined each of the five types of
support in a separate model to confirm the results from total
amount of support and check whether there are different
patterns for specific types of support (not shown in table).
Parents' and children's needs and resources had little
influence on discrepancies of total support in downward and
upward exchanges, with one exception that children's health
was positively associated with a discrepancy of downward
exchange. That is, children in better health reported receiving
more support compared with their parents' reports of support
given. Looking at each type of support, although some
significant effects of children's characteristics were found on
discrepancies, the effects were not consistent across most or
all types of support.
Turning to the parent­child dyad characteristics, none
of the predictors were associated with discrepancies in
downward exchanges and only coresidence was positively
associated with a discrepancy score in upward exchanges,
indicating that children who live together with their parents
reported giving more help than parents reported receiving.
Post hoc tests of each type of support showed that children
of coresident dyads reported giving more advice (B = 2.08,
p < .05) and financial support (B = 2.49, p < .05) than parents
reported receiving.
Parents' obligation toward children was the most consis-
tent and significant predictor of discrepancies in reported
support in both downward and upward exchanges. Parents
who have strong feelings of obligation toward children were
likely to report giving and receiving more support than chil-
dren report. The post hoc tests of each type of support
revealed that for upward exchanges, parents' obligations
were significant for discrepancies in all types of support
except financial support. For downward exchanges, parents'
obligation was significant for discrepancies in practical
assistance (B = -0.38, p < .05) and advice (B = -0.69, p < .01).
Children's obligation toward parents, however, was not
associated with discrepancies in total support for either
downward or upward exchanges. It should be noted that
both parents' and children's obligations were significantly
associated with mean levels of support exchanges.
Turning to ratings of the importance of the relationship,
children's ratings showed significant effects on discrepancies
in total support for both downward and upward exchanges.
Children who regarded the relationship with their parent
as more important tended to report giving and receiving
more than parents reported. For specific types of support,
children's importance ratings were significant for the
discrepancies in emotional support (B = 0.82, p < .001) and
listening to their parent (B = 0.30, p < .05) in downward

exchanges. Also, children's rating of importance was
significantly associated with the level of upward and down-
ward exchanges. Interestingly, parents' perceived importance
of the parent­child relationship was not associated with
discrepancies as well as levels of support exchanges.
Discussion
Exchanges of support between parents and their adult
children are used to meet everyday needs and sustain the
bonds between generations. Our results suggest that parents
and their adult children differ in systematic ways in their
perceptions of how much support is exchanged. How each
generation views these exchanges of support may be of
considerable importance. If a parent­child dyad disagrees
on how much support is exchanged, it may lead to misun-
derstandings, resentment, or conflict and may affect their
continued willingness to give support to one another. For
example, in situations where parents perceive that children
give less support than children perceive they have given, a
parent may feel entitled to receiving more frequent support,
whereas a child may interpret the discrepancy as indicating
the parent would like all of his/her time and attention. The
ways in which discrepancies affect parent­child relationships
and future exchanges needs further exploration.

DISCREPANCIES IN REPORTS OF SUPPORT EXCHANGES 535
We drew upon two theories, self-enhancement and family
systems, in formulating hypotheses about discrepancies
in reports of support exchanges between generations.
Consistent with self-enhancement theory, children re-
ported giving all types of support more frequently than
parents reported receiving, which is similar to the findings
previously reported by Mandemakers and Dykstra (2008).
Unlike that study, however, we did not find a consistent
pattern in discrepancies for downward exchanges of parents
giving to children. For those exchanges, parents reported
giving more practical assistance and less advice than chil-
dren reported receiving, which may still reflect self-
enhancement, albeit in a different way. Giving practical
help is consistent with a positive image of the parental role,
while advice-giving may be interpreted by older adults as
being intrusive and interfering in children's lives. This in-
terpretation is consistent with our view that self-enhancement
processes are modified by the family context.
This study allowed us to examine a wide range of factors
that might account for discrepancies, including structural
factors (needs and resources and dyadic characteristics) and
psychological factors (family obligation and relationship
importance). These factors reflect family process and context
regarding support exchanges within family. Our findings
showed that psychological aspects of family relationships
have most consistent effects on discrepancies. Interestingly,
different psychological factors affected discrepancies for
parents and children. Parents who felt more obligations
toward their children reported both giving and receiving
more support than children reported. For children, although
obligation was associated with the level of support they
reported giving to and receiving from parents, it was not
related to discrepancies in support. Rather, for children, rating
of the importance of the relationship with their parents had a
significant relation to discrepancies. These findings confirmed
the report of Mandemakers and Dykstra (2008) that only
parent's feelings of obligation toward their children were
associated with discrepancies. Since our study focused on
offspring in midlife and parents in old age, however, parents
in the current study had lower feelings of obligation toward
their children than children reported toward parents. As
parents age, they may feel less overall obligation to children
because they may have fewer resources, greater needs, or
their children are settled and have fewer needs. Nonetheless,
only parents' obligation to children exerts an influence on
perceptions of support given and received. It makes sense
that parents who feel a stronger obligation would report giv-
ing more support than children report receiving. They may
also cast positive light on support received because they
view it as reciprocation of the obligation they feel toward
their children.
We found a similar pattern regarding investment in the
relationship. Parents reported the relationship as more
important to them than did their children, but relationship
importance was a significant predictor of discrepancies only
for children. Prior studies have documented that children
place less importance on their relationship with parents than
parents do with children (Bengtson & Kuypers, 1971;
Giarrusso et al., 1995). Our findings extend that work by
demonstrating that rather children's investment in the rela-
tionship has an influence on discrepancies between parents
and children in perceptions of support. The finding that chil-
dren with greater investment would perceive giving more
support to parents makes sense. Viewing their relationship
with parents as more important may also lead them to cast a
more positive light on support received. Taken together,
these findings on obligation and importance suggest that
discrepancies between parents and children in their percep-
tions of support given and received have to do with feelings
they have about the relationship. As at other points in the
life course, it may be that subjective beliefs about the rela-
tionship may differ between parents and children and lead
to discrepancies in perceptions.
In contrast to these psychological dimensions, needs and
resources of parents and children did not consistently
predict the discrepancies. Prior studies that reported the
effects of needs and resources on discrepancies (Lin, 2008;
Shapiro, 2004) did not take into account psychological fac-
tors, such as obligation and importance. Our finding shows
that while needs and resources affect level of exchanges,
subjective beliefs are more important for understanding
how people perceive the exchanges.
Dyadic characteristics of the parent­child dyad were also
not significant predictors of discrepancies, with the excep-
tion of coresidence. For upward exchanges of child to parent,
children who live with parents reported giving more
support than parents reported receiving. Coresidence may
in many cases come about because parents need more
support. Children in that situation may be more attuned to
giving assistance, though parents may still want to see
themselves as independent.
Some limitations of the study need to be considered.
First, though the use of information from multiple reporters
offers a unique opportunity to look at the correspondence of
the reports between parents and children, the parents who
agreed to participate in this survey may be more likely to
have better relationships with their children than those par-
ents who did not participate. Second, we can only identify
discrepancies, but not how the discrepancies are related to
the amount of the actual exchanges. How family members
perceive exchanges, however, will be more important for
the overall quality of their relationships than the actual
amounts of support given and received.
These findings confirm and expand upon prior research
that demonstrated discrepancies between parents and their
middle-aged children in the amount of support given and
received. Discrepancies are a potential source of misunder-
standing and conflict within families and may condition the
response when either parents or their children need extensive
help for health or social problems. Of particular note is that
KIM ET AL.

the reasons for discrepancies differ by generation. Intervention
for families that face major challenges like caregiving may
need to take into account the differences in how parents and
children view the support and assistance they give to one
another, and the different reasons for these discrepancies. It
will be important for future research to examine the effects of
discrepancies on future exchanges and other aspects of family
relationships over time.
