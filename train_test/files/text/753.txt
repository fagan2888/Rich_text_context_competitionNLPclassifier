Activities, and Well-being

What is the relationship between religious involvement and functional disability among elderly people? Is being dis-
abled different for those who frequently attend religious services? Does religious involvement have an effect on sub-
sequent change in disability? Deriving our hypotheses from traditional theories in the sociology of religion, these
questions are explored in these two related articles. Both employ data from the New Haven site of the Established
Populationsfor the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (N = 2812). In the first, cross-sectional correlates of religious
involvement and disability are examined at the baseline of the study, including multiple indicators of health practices,
social activities, and subjective well-being. We test for interactions between religious attendance and disability.
Findings are (a) that religious involvement in 1982 is tied to a broad array of behavioral and psychosocial resources,
(b) that these resources are associated primarily with attendance at services, and not with subjective feelings of reli-
giousness, and (c) that some of these associations are especially pronounced among disabled respondents.
HOW is religious involvement related to the health and
functioning of elderly persons? Long theoretical tradi-
tions in the sociology and psychology of religion link reli-
gious beliefs and practices to higher levels of health and
well-being (Durkheim, 1897 [1951]; Durkheim, 1912
[1995]; James, 1901-2 [1978]). Empirically, a growing
number of recent studies also conclude that religious prac-
tices are associated with better mental and physical health
(reviewed in Koenig, 1995; Levin, 1994). There are many
theoretical reasons for expecting religion to be related to
better health: religious beliefs often foster good health
practices and minimize poor ones such as alcohol and sub-
stance abuse; religious communities provide cohesive so-
cial network contacts and support for people with large and
small life problems; and religion offers a coherent, overar-
ching set of beliefs for interpreting the events of life and
death (Idler, 1994). Given these broad domains, it is hard to
imagine any aspect of human health research, from preven-
tive practices to the care of the dying, among elderly per-
sons or any other group, to which religion is not potentially
relevant.
The sociology of religion, going back to its origins, sup-
plies us with an overarching theoretical framework that
places all of these reasons in a coherent structure. Religions
tend to promote healthy life styles as part of their overall
regulative function; Durkheim's study of suicide rates
showed that religious groups provide rules for many areas
of life, and that these rules have a preservative function for
individuals (1897 [1951]). The case of health behaviors is
actually a very clear one; practices which are proscribed,
such as drinking to excess, smoking, or having multiple sex-
ual partners, are self-indulgent, individualistic behaviors
that groups have an interest in constraining. Religious
groups have an integrative function, as well. They provide
members with a sense of belonging and a source of tangible
support that Durkheim found was also related to lower rates
of suicide. Finally, religious groups offer members an elabo-
rated system of beliefs, about God and human relationships,
many of which are extremely relevant to health. Max Weber
describes religious revelation as providing "coherent mean-
ing" for "both social and cosmic events" (1922 [1964]).
Questions about meaning and purpose in one's life tend to
be brought to the foreground in crises, especially that of se-
rious illness, and also as part of normal developmental
aging processes at the end of life (Erikson, Erikson, and
Kivnick, 1986). Religious belief systems provide "symbolic
universes" (Berger, 1967) in which these events gain spiri-
tual significance, placing the individual's life in a much
larger context, of membership in a continuing community of
believers, or an afterlife. Thus, there are many reasons for
thinking that religion should be beneficial for individual
health; we do not consider this list exhaustive, but only il-
lustrative of the complexity of religious involvement.
Moreover, religion is of particular importance to elderly
Americans; nationally, 52 percent of those 65 and over at-
tend religious services once a week or more, by far the
highest of any age group (Princeton Religion Research
Center, 1994). A recent National Institute on Aging (NIA)
conference highlighted the existing state of knowledge
about aging, health, and religion, and concluded that, while
religiousness and religious affiliation are generally found to
be positively related to health and well-being, methodologi-
cal limitations plague much of the work that has been done
to date, and the relationship is poorly understood (NIA,
1995). Biases identified in existing studies included small
convenience samples, unknown reliability and validity of
measures of religiousness, selective attrition, and the non-
generalizability of regional or demographically narrow
S294
RELIGION AND DISABLED PERSONS S295
samples. The conference concluded that religious activities
and beliefs were important to large segments of the elderly
population and that more studies of this complex social and
psychological phenomenon were warranted.
Other recent reviews of the literature in this area have
also called for improvements in study design and measure-
ment (Koenig, Smiley, and Gonzales, 1988; Levin, 1994).
Empirical support for a causal relationship in an epidemio-
logical study would optimally have a prospective study de-
sign that employs a representative sample that is socially
arid religiously heterogeneous, collects data that represent
the multiple dimensions of religious beliefs, practices, and
subjective feelings, and assesses health status comprehen-
sively. Moreover, an attempt to identify the mechanisms un-
derlying such a relationship would necessitate the availabil-
ity of additional data on health practices, social ties, and/or
subjective well-being.
In these two articles we ask a series of questions about
the relationship between religious involvement, disability,
and other aspects of the lives of elderly people both cross-
sectionally and longitudinally. Do the lives of elderly peo-
ple who attend religious services (or who are privately de-
vout) differ from the lives of those who do not, in other
ways besides the specifically religious domain? Does atten-
dance at religious services or do subjective feelings of reli-
giousness form a pattern with better health practices, or
more close social relations, or a higher level of well-being?
And in any of these areas, is there a particular importance
of religious involvement for disabled elderly persons? In
the second article (Idler and Kasl, 1997) we ask about both
the longitudinal impact of religion on disability and the im-
pact of disability on religion, extending previously pub-
lished short-term findings on the former (Idler and Kasl,
1992) to the final (1994) wave of data collection for the
project. We then look to see if effects of religious atten-
dance and subjective religiousness on disability are
explained in any way by differential patterns in health
practices, social contacts, or well-being. Our theoretical
framework links religion to better health conceptually, and
simultaneously suggests ways in which religion may have
both direct and indirect effects on health.
We begin by examining the characteristics of elderly per-
sons in New Haven, Connecticut, who attend services fre-
quently and who describe themselves as highly religious
people. At the cross-sectional level, we expect to see
healthier members of the sample attending services more
often, either because past attendance has already benefited
them, or because of selection effects preventing the
already-disabled from participating. Thus there are, in ef-
fect, two strong reasons for expecting the same direction of
association. With subjective religiousness the case is much
less clear. Because people often turn to religion in times of
crisis, particularly health crises, for solace and comfort, the
relationship between subjective religiousness and health is
potentially v*ery complex (Idler, 1995). Religious feelings
are not subject to the same kinds of selection effects as at-
tendance; no physical effort or ability is required for experi-
encing them. At the cross-sectional level, then, we might
expect to find higher feelings of subjective religiousness
precisely among people in poor health.
Hypothesis 1: Cross-sectionally, better health status and
functioning will be associated with higher levels of atten-
dance at services.
Hypothesis 2: Cross-sectionally, poorer health status and
functioning will be associated with higher levels of subjec-
tive religiousness, or there will be no association between
the two.
We then examine the behavioral and psychosocial corre-
lates of religious involvement, controlling for health condi-
tions and disability at the baseline of the study. Because
Durkheimian regulation implicit in religious involvement
may promote a "healthier" life style with respect to tradi-
tional risk factors, we examine the cross-sectional associa-
tions between religious involvement (attendance and sub-
jective religiousness) and smoking, alcohol use, obesity,
and physical exercise. The negative association between
religiousness and lower levels of alcohol use is relatively
well-documented, both cross-sectionally and longitudi-
nally (studies reviewed in Gorsuch, 1995), despite differ-
ing religious norms regarding drinking and the almost total
absence of theory in this area. Few studies have examined
smoking and religiousness; one report found lower con-
sumption of tobacco among the more religious in a sample
of elderly geriatric patients (Koenig, Moberg, and Kvale,
1988). With relatively little empirical research to guide us,
we take the Durkheimian point of view (see also
Mechanic, 1990) that attendance at religious services is ev-
idence, among other things, of the observance of social
norms in general, and therefore hypothesize that there will
be a beneficial effect of religious involvement of any type
on health practices.
Hypothesis 3: High levels of religious involvement, both at-
tendance and subjective feelings, will be associated with
fewer poor health practices of smoking, high alcohol use,
overweight, and lack ofphysical activity.
Durkheim's work in Suicide also showed that religious
groups provide social support and integration, in addition to
constraining individuals by regulating their behavior.
Empirically there are just a few studies that look at the pos-
itive cross-sectional association between membership in re-
ligious groups and other types of social ties. In a North
Carolina study, frequent attenders at religious services had
larger social networks, more contacts with them, more so-
cial support from them, and more feelings of being valued
and cared for than infrequent attenders or nonattenders
(Ellison and George, 1994). These findings were recently
replicated on a national sample (Bradley, 1995). In the
North Carolina study, attendance at services was associated
with more extensive non-kin networks, as one might have
expected, rather than additional family contacts. We hy-
pothesize that higher levels of religious involvement will be
associated with more leisure social activities, and larger and
closer social networks (especially of non-kin).
Hypothesis 4: High levels of religious involvement (atten-
dance and subjective feelings) will be associated with
larger and closer social networks, and greater numbers of
leisure activities.
S296 IDLER AND KASL
These higher levels of social connections fostered by re-
ligious involvement should then promote higher levels of
well-being. In addition to the Durkheimian functions of re-
ligious groups, the Weberian strand in the sociology of reli-
gion directs our attention to understanding human action at
the level of meaning. A more cognitively based line of rea-
soning might be that religion offers a framework for inter-
preting the joys and losses in life that is especially helpful
in old age. Religion, as a system of symbols, provides re-
sources for helping individuals to find meaning in all the
events of life, meanings that are socially shared, and which
link human affairs to the transcendent. William James ob-
served long ago that religion is associated with the positive
attitudes of hope and optimism (James, 1901-2 [1978]). As
Koenig (Koenig, Smiley, and Gdhzales, 1988) writes, "The
Judeo-Christian scriptures are full of references to the
power of the thought life in affecting both emotional and
spiritual states... [they] encourage positive thinking... and
often direct thoughts toward helping others in worse situa-
tions" (p. 36). Reviews of the literature show a strong asso-
ciation of religion with better mental health (Koenig, 1995;
Levin, 1994). The very small amount of empirical research
that exists on the relationship between religion and opti-
mism also shows that turning to religion is associated with
the generalized expectation that outcomes will be positive
(Carver, Scheier, and Weintraub, 1989; Scheier and Carver,
1987). Another indicator of subjective well-being is the re-
spondent's self-ratings of health, which may also be en-
hanced by religious participation, if it directs attention
away from the physical and toward the spiritual realm
(Ferraro and Koch, 1994; Idler, 1995).
Hypothesis 5: Religious involvement will be positively asso-
ciated with optimism and better self-ratings of health, and
negatively associated with depression.
Studies of religious coping, of people in adverse situa-
tions seeking comfort and understanding in religion, are be-
coming more frequent (Ellison, 1994; Mclntosh, Silver, and
Wortrhan, 1993; Pargament and Park, 1995; Park and
Cohen, 1993). One study of elderly hospitalized veterans
found that religious coping was the sole predictor of lower
depression scores at a 6-month follow-up (Koenig et al.,
1992); others have shown that religion is especially effec-
tive in coping with situations of loss or illness (Mattlin,
Wethington, and Kessler, 1990; Moen, Robison, and
Dempster-McClain, 1995; Siegel and Kuykendall, 1990).
While we do not have direct measures of coping available
in this study, we can approach this topic by looking for dif-
ferential effects of religious involvement among the dis-
abled, or interaction effects. While we expect to see no dif-
ferences with respect to health practices, we hypothesize
that religious involvement of either type will have special
psychosocial benefits for the disabled. Two earlier analyses
of these data (Idler, 1987; Idler and Kasl, 1992) showed
lower levels of depression among the religiously involved
disabled compared with the nonreligious disabled; we ex-
pect that these differential associations will extend to social
contacts with kin and friends, and our multiple measures of
well-being, which include optimism, several subcategories
of depression, and self-ratings of health.
Hypothesis 6: There will be stronger effects of religious in-
volvement on social activities and well-being among the
disabled than among the nondisabled (interaction effect).
Since Durkheim's Suicide (1897 [1951]), sociologists of
religion have frequently documented the differing benefits
of religious group membership by denomination (Ellison,
1991; Pescosolido and Georgianna, 1989). Religious in-
volvement is also known to be greater on average among
elderly African Americans than among elderly Whites
(Krause, 1992; Levin, Taylor, and Chatters, 1994; Nye,
1992-93), and among women more than among men
(Cornwall, 1989; Miller and Hoffman, 1995; Thompson,
1991). Age differences might also be important, as the pro-
cess of aging changes both the amount (Blazer and Pal-
more, 1976; Chaves, 1991) and the quality or meaning of
religious involvement (Fowler, 1981; McFadden, 1995).
Thus, we include religious affiliation, age, race, and gender
as covariates in all cross-sectional analyses.
METHOD
Sample
Data are from the New Haven site of the Established
Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly
(EPESE) project of the National Institute on Aging (Cornoni-
Huntley et al., 1986). Noninstitutionalized, community-
dwelling elderly persons (N = 2812) in the city of New
Haven were interviewed annually from 1982 through 1989,
and again in 1994, some years in person, some by telephone.
The stratified probability sample was drawn from public
housing, privately financed housing for elderly people, and
community neighborhoods. Males and residents of public
and private housing were oversampled. The 1982 response
rate was 82 percent; annual follow-up response rates aver-
aged 96 percent for survivors.
Measures
Religion. -- There are two measures of religious involve-
ment and one of affiliation. Respondents were asked if they
were Protestant, Roman Catholic, Jewish, other, or had no
religious preference. Because of small numbers we com-
bined the other and no preference categories. Also, because
the Protestant group was known to be divided among
Blacks and Whites with very different socioeconomic and
religious practice characteristics, we divided this group by
race. These categories yield us a set of four dummy vari-
ables with "Roman Catholic" the reference category.
Frequency of attendance at services is measured by a sin-
gle item with six categories ranging from "more than once
a week" to "never"; 40 percent of the sample attend ser-
vices once a week or more. Subjective religious involve-
ment is composed of how deeply religious a person feels (4
categories), and how much strength and comfort they re-
ceive from religion (3 categories); 37 percent of the sample
feel "deeply" religious and 71 percent report receiving "a
great deal" of strength and comfort from religion. Religious
attendance and subjective religiousness are moderately as-
sociated with each other; the 1982 measures have a Pearson
RELIGION AND DISABLED PERSONS S297
r of .36. We recognize that these three indicators of reli-
gious involvement are not ideal; there are too few to be
considered optimal from a measurement point of view, and
some important dimensions (private devotional practices)
are omitted altogether. However, these are the data avail-
able from this project, which was not designed for research
on religion. We would note that (a) the single religious at-
tendance item makes our study comparable with most of
the other research in the field; (b) the 1982 two-item sub-
jective religiousness measure has a Cronbach's alpha of
.70; and (c) both the attendance and subjective religious-
ness measures show temporal stability, with Pearson rs of
.60 or higher with the same measures in 1985.
Functional ability. -- This variable is composed of 15
items asked at baseline in 1982 and at every annual follow-
up. For the present analysis, a new scale was constructed to
improve the sensitivity of an earlier scale (which was de-
scribed in Berkman et al., 1986), especially to variation
within the "severe" disability category. Because the 15
items came from three different sources, and contained dif-
ferent numbers of response categories, a simple sum of
items was not possible. We also wanted to retain all the de-
tail of the responses (for example, differentiating "has some
difficulty" from "unable to do"). Thus, we gave each item a
maximum score of 10 and a minimum score of 0, and ap-
portioned to intervening categories accordingly (0 = Needs
no help, 5 = Needs help from person or equipment, 10 =
Unable to do [from Katz et al., 1970]; 0 = Able to do, 10 =
Not able to do [from Rosow and Breslau, 1966]; 0 = No
difficulty, 2.5 = A little difficulty, 5 = Some difficulty, 7.5 =
A lot of difficulty, 10 = Unable to do [from Nagi, 1976]). A
respondent's mean score for nonmissing items was at-
tributed to items for two or fewer missing items. This re-
duced the amount of missing data for 1982 scores to just
1.1 percent. Scores could and did range from 0 to 150; the
mean score was just under 19 (see Table 1). Cronbach's
alpha for the 1982 scale was .87.
Health status. -- Covariates for 1982 health status were
a part of all analyses. Data were available on diagnosed
chronic conditions; symptoms that might indicate serious,
but undiagnosed, conditions; measured blood pressure; and
interviewer-observed prescription medications. We at-
tempted to use all of the health status information available
in the data, including indicators of recency, severity, site,
and medications, as follow-up questions to a number of the
chronic condition items. Table 1 shows the coding direction
and means of all variables we considered. The variables
Stroke, Diabetes, and Amputation, which have three cate-
gories in the table, are treated as separate contrasts in the
analysis (with "condition absent" as the reference cate-
gory). Health status variables that were not significantly as-
sociated with the dependent variable in 1982 or in any of
the years of follow-up were dropped from the analysis.
Demographics. -- Table 1 shows univariate statistics for
demographic characteristics, including sex, age, race
(White, non-White), education, perceived low income, and
marital status. The sample is 42 percent male and 21 per-
cent non-White; 37 percent are married and 9 percent feel
their income is inadequate for their needs. The average age
of respondents is 74.5 years and they have had an average
of 9 years of education.
Health practices. -- Table 1 also shows univariate statis-
tics for the health practices we considered. Fifty percent of
the sample has never smoked, 20 percent currently smoke,
and 30 percent have quit. The physical activities index in-
cludes gardening, exercise, sports, and walking, scored as
never, sometimes, or always, and summed; over 90 percent
of the sample score below the theoretical midpoint of the
scale. For a measure of overweight, we used a continuous
measure of body mass index (BMI) values (calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters, squared);
men with a BMI of 27.8 or more, and women with a BMI of
27.3 meet the conventional criteria for obesity, approxi-
mately 120 percent of desirable weight (Kuczmarski et al.,
1994). With these criteria, 26 percent of our sample are clas-
sified as obese, a lower proportion for this age group than in
a nationally representative sample (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1995). Our alcohol use index multiplies
the amount (number of usual drinks) by the frequency (num-
ber of times drinking per week), and weights by the alcohol
content for beer, wine, or liquor consumed; 51 percent of the
sample do not drink at all, and 80 percent have scores below
the mean, reflecting the skewed distribution of the scores.
Social activities. -- The social activities index, scored in
the same way as the physical activities index, includes
going to movies, sports events, shopping, watching TV,
preparing meals, reading, traveling, doing community or
volunteer work, playing cards or bingo, and doing puzzles
or hobbies. The scores here are much higher than they were
for physical activities; most respondents score in the theo-
retical midrange of the scale. The number of social contacts
was reported separately as family (children, siblings, rela-
tives) seen at least once a month, and friends seen at least
once a month. Scores represent actual numbers of persons
mentioned. Twenty-two percent reported seeing no friends
regularly, and almost 17 percent reported seeing no family.
The number of close relationships was also reported as
family members the respondent felt close to, and close
friends. Twenty-two percent also reported no close friends,
but only 5.5 percent reported no kin they felt close to. An
additional measure of social ties was provided by asking
the respondent with whom they had celebrated the last win-
ter holidays (Christmas, Hannukah, or New Year's). Scores
on this variable reflect the number of groups (spouse, chil-
dren, siblings, relatives, friends, neighbors, etc.) mentioned,
not the number of persons. Only 9 percent of the sample
said they had celebrated the holidays with no one.
Well-being. -- Psychological characteristics of self-rated
health, depression symptoms, and optimism were also exam-
ined. Self-rated health was the single-item measure scored as
excellent, good, fair, poor, or bad. Fifty-eight percent of the
sample reported that their health was good or excellent. The
measure of depression symptoms used was the CES-D scale
(Radloff, 1977), and in addition we broke it down into its

four subscales, which have been verified for this sample
(Berkman et al., 1986). The 20-item CES-D scale is scored
0-60; we attributed a respondent's mean score for up to three
missing items. Cronbach's alpha for the 20-item scale is .86.
Eighty-four percent of the sample scores below the conven-
tional cutpoint of 16. The subscales include positive affect
(feeling as good as other people, feeling hopeful about the
future, being happy, and enjoying life) (alpha = .65); negative
affect (having the blues, feeling depressed, feeling lonely,
crying, and feeling sad) (alpha = .81); somatic distress (loss
of appetite, everything is an effort, can't get going) (alpha =
.59); and interpersonal problems (people are unfriendly, peo-
ple dislike me) (alpha = .57). The measure of optimism was a
sum of two items, having faith that things will turn out all
right, and feeling a part of things (alpha = .56); 54 percent of
the sample scored the maximum. Clearly, several of these al-
phas are only marginally acceptable. We include the CES-D
subscales for illustrative purposes, but rely on the psychome-
trically sound full CES-D score for the later longitudinal
analyses. The measure of optimism is not what one would
wish, but it is so potentially important in understanding the
effect of religion that we use it anyway.
Analysis. -- Univariate and bivariate analyses are un-
weighted. All multivariate regression analyses were per-
formed with SUDAAN to adjust for the complex, stratified,
and clustered nature of the study design. This procedure ad-
justs standard errors by weighting for the different sampling
fractions and nonresponse; it frequently produces larger

cance (Shah et al., 1992). Most models have interval-level or
continuous dependent variables, to which least-squares esti-

mates for linear regression are fitted. One dichotomous vari-
able, smoking, required maximum likelihood techniques for
logistic regression. We used the much simpler binomial, in-
stead of the trinomial, logistic regression for smoking be-
cause a cross-tabulation of smoking status by attendance at
services showed that past smokers had patterns of atten-
dance that were nearly identical to present smokers, and that
both were significantly different from those who had never
smoked. In the second, longitudinal phase of this study, we
retain the three categories of smoking for use as independent
variables.
First, we looked at bivariate associations between disabil-
ity and the three religion measures. Then we regressed atten-
dance and subjective religiousness on the full set of disabil-
ity, health status, and sociodemographic factors. Next, we
regressed each of the health behavior, social network, and
subjective well-being characteristics on religious involve-
ment, disability, the set of health status covariates, and the
demographic factors. Because we were particularly inter-
ested in disabled elderly persons, we tested interaction terms
for disability by religiousness. Where it was appropriate, we
stratified the sample by disability level to clarify the inter-
pretation of the interaction. All coefficients reported in
Tables 2 to 4 are unstandardized; they can be interpreted di-
rectly as units of change in the dependent variable at-
tributable to one unit of change in the independent variable.
RESULTS
Initial bivariate analysis of disability and the three reli-
gion measures (affiliation, attendance, and subjective) was
undertaken with cross-tabulations (not shown). Disability
scores were trichotomized into three roughly equal-sized
groups, those with no disability at all (score = 0, n = 924),
those with mild to moderate disability (score = 1-21, n =
950), and those with severe disability (score = 22+, n =
907). These tables showed that Black Protestants were
more likely than expected to fall into the most disabled cat-
egory, and that Roman Catholics were correspondingly less
disabled (x2 = 41.64, p < .001). Other analyses show that
this is an effect of race rather than denomination. A second
table showed a strong association between disability level
and attendance, with exactly 50 percent of those with no
disability attending weekly or more often, compared with
44.9 percent of those with mild-to-moderate disability, and
25.6 percent of those with severe disability. Thirty-seven
percent of those in the highest category of disability
attend services once a month or more (M-H x2 = 140.15,
p < .001). The association between subjective religiousness
and disability is U-shaped; more than the expected number
of those with no disability say they are deeply religious, but
so do those with severe disability (x2 = 24.7, p = .006).
Pearson r for attendance and disability is -.26 and for sub-
jective religiousness and disability is .06.
The first two columns of Table 2 take the two religion
measures as dependent variables, showing their associa-
tions with the affiliation groups, disability, health status,
and sociodemographics. They show us the characteristics of
attenders and those with strong religious feelings, and also
provide a basis for later analyses in which follow-up mea-
sures of religion are taken as dependent variables. The first
column shows that, as we would expect, the two religion
measures are strongly correlated with each other, and that,
compared with Roman Catholics, Black Protestants are
more frequent in attendance, but that White Protestants,
Jews, and the other/none group all attend services signifi-
cantly less frequently. Hypothesis 1 is supported, as we see
that disability has a strong negative relationship to atten-
dance. Once disability has been taken into account, none of
the other health status measures show an association with
attendance. Men are significantly less likely than women to
attend services, while those with more education attend
more often than those with less. Age, race, income, and
marital status show no effects. This model accounts for
about 27 percent of the variance in attendance. Column two
takes subjective religious feelings as its dependent variable
with a similar set of independent variables. In some re-
spects the results are quite similar; again Roman Catholics,
Black Protestants, and women exhibit the highest levels of
religiousness, but several other characteristics show the op-
posite pattern from attendance: disability, the number of
prescription medications, education, and age all have oppo-
site signs from the attendance model, indicating higher lev-
els of subjective religiousness among those who are older,
less educated, and in poorer health. Hypothesis 2 is thus
also supported by the data.
Table 2 continues by regressing several indicators of
health practices on sets of independent variables which rep-
resent religious involvement, health status, and demographic
factors. The purpose is to test the hypothesis that religious
involvement will be associated with better health practices.
An adequate test requires that we adjust, not only for health
status in these models (to minimize the possibility that se-
lection of the healthiest respondents could explain the asso-
ciation), but also for demographic factors known to be asso-
ciated with religious involvement, health practices, or both.
The last four models in Table 2 show the association of reli-
gious involvement with physical activity, obesity, alcohol
use, and smoking, in multivariate models which include de-
mographic factors, health status and, most importantly,
baseline functional disability. Looking at the first two rows,
we see that attendance at services is associated with better
health practices in three of the four models; attendance is
strongly associated with higher levels of exercise, less alco-
hol use, and never smoking. High levels of subjective reli-
giousness are associated with never having smoked, but also
with having a higher weight-to-height ratio. There are also
some differences among the affiliation groups: Protestants
are not different from Roman Catholics when it comes to
these health practices, but Jews are significantly less likely
to be overweight, to use alcohol frequently, or to have
smoked. Those with other or no preference also have better
health practices, including more physical activity and fewer
smokers. Health status and sociodemographic variables are
included in the models as covariates only. In sum, while
there are between-group differences by religious affiliation,
and noting the exception of overweight, the important find-
ing of the table is that greater religious involvement, primar-
ily more frequent attendance at religious services, is associ-
ated with better health practices in most of these areas,
providing support for Hypothesis 3.

To check on differential associations by level of disabil-
ity, we tested interaction terms for religious attendance by
disability in the four models, and found that none were sig-
nificant. This finding was confirmed by running the models
separately for the three disability subgroups.
Table 3 shows a test of Hypothesis 4, with models for
leisure activities and social ties. Reading across the columns,
we see that higher levels of attendance at services are signifi-
cantly associated, in every case but one, with more social ac-
tivity: religious participation is positively associated with
more leisure activities, all types of social network ties except
the number of close kin, and more numerous holiday cele-
brations. Subjective religiousness is associated only with the
number of kin contacts reported. All of these associations are
in a positive direction. Within the affiliation categories, there
are a large number of negative signs, indicating that Roman
Catholics overall have higher levels of social interaction, es-
pecially with kin, than the other groups. The groups show no
differences with respect to friendships, however. Jews report
more leisure activities than do Catholics.
Other general characteristics of Table 3 are that very few
of the physical health status variables, included primarily as
covariates, are associated with anything; in this sample at
least, poorer health and higher levels of disability are not
strongly associated with diminishing social contacts -- in
fact, previous history of broken bones and the more serious
types of diabetes are associated with more, not fewer, kin
contacts and close friends. Poor cognitive function, on the
other hand, clearly has a negative effect on activities and
friendships, but not on kin contacts. Income is not signifi-
cantly associated with any of these variables, but race, mar-
ital status, education, and gender are, in frequently conflict-
ing ways. Married people name fewer activities and friends,
but more close kin, kin contact, and holiday celebrations.
Highly educated people have more activities and close
friends, but fewer kin contacts, and men have fewer leisure
activities, and more friends.
Overall, however, Hypothesis 4 is supported; attendance
at religious services is positively associated with all of
these social ties (except close kin) and activities, and it is
the only characteristic in the table that is uniformly positive
in its associations; marital status, by contrast, has signifi-
cant associations, but with both positive and negative signs.
Subjective religious feelings, on the other hand, are associ-
ated only with the number of kin contacts reported. The
picture given by these cross-sectional associations is that
public religious involvement is part of a broad set of social
roles and activities. Elderly people who attend services fre-
quently also have large and active family lives, large and
active friendship networks, more holiday parties to attend,
and more of the other types of leisure activities as well.
To test Hypothesis 6, that religious involvement might
have enhanced benefits for disabled elderly persons in the
sample, we introduced an Attendance by Disability interac-

tion into each model. The results showed none significant at
the p < .05 level. However, there were marginally significant
effects for the number of friends seen (p = .08) and celebra-
tion of holidays (p = .08). We followed up by running the
models for these dependent variables separately for the three
disability subgroups, and found that in both cases there was a
very strong association for the most disabled subgroup, and
none at all for the mildly or nondisabled, exactly along the
lines of Hypothesis 6. In general, Table 3 shows that reli-
gious attendance is linked to many other forms of social inte-
gration, not only in spite of disability, but especially where
disability is present. Moreover, religious attendance is associ-
ated simultaneously with family and friendship involvement;
other variables, such as sex, marital status, or education, have
opposite signs for family and friend ties, suggesting trade-
offs between them. Religious involvement, on the other hand,
supports (or is supported by) kin and non-kin alike.
Table 4 presents the results of similarly structured regres-
sion analyses of self-rated health, depression symptoms, and
optimism on religious involvement, disability, health status,
and demographic factors. Hypothesis 5 stated that both mea-
sures of religious involvement would be associated with
more positive states of well-being, although we expected
that subjective feelings, more than attendance, would be in-
volved. However, here, as in the previous tables, it is primar-
ily attendance at services that has the strong associations.
Respondents who attend services more frequently have sig-
nificantly fewer total symptoms of depression, including the
components of positive affect (this scale is coded in reverse
for summing with the others), fewer somatic complaints,
and fewer interpersonal problems. Attendance is marginally
associated with optimism, but neither attendance nor subjec-
tive religiousness is associated with negative affect or self-
rated health. Black Protestants are significantly different
from Roman Catholics in several respects. They -report
fewer symptoms of depression, less negative affect, and
more optimism, but also more interpersonal problems than
Roman Catholics; other groups show no differences.
Health status measures are more apt to be associated with
these measures of subjective well-being than they were with
the social structural characteristics. Higher levels of disabil-
ity, more prescription medications, congestive heart failure,
and cognitive impairment are all associated with more de-
pression symptoms. Women and those with low income also
show higher levels of depression symptoms. Disability, pre-
scription medications, congestive heart failure, and lower
levels of education, but not either type of religious involve-
ment, are associated with poorer self-ratings of health. The
model for optimism is more complicated and is only
marginally associated with religiousness. People who have

had a stroke and are not left with remaining difficulties are
more optimistic than those who have never had a stroke;
those with moderate, but not severe, cognitive impairment
are more optimistic than those with none; and those with
low income and less education are all less optimistic.
Overall it is more often attendance, not subjective religious
feelings, that is associated with better subjective well-being,
offering partial support for Hypothesis 5.
Again we tested the models for interactions and this
time found two, for positive affect and for optimism. To be
certain of the interpretation we reran the models for these
two dependent variables in each of the disability sub-
groups. The differences between the groups are quite strik-
ing. In the nondisabled group, there are no significant asso-
ciations of either religion variable with either dependent
variable. For positive affect, there is also no association for
the mildly disabled group; the entire significant association
reported as a main effect of religious attendance in Table 4
comes from the very strong association between atten-
dance and positive affect in the severely disabled group (b
= -.287, p = .0009). For optimism, there is some associa-
tion (b = .077, p = .049) for the mildly disabled group, but
a much stronger one for the most disabled (b = .150, p -
.009). These significant interaction effects provide the
strongest support in the analysis for Hypothesis 6. Putting
the interpretation another way, if one is not disabled, atten-
dance at religious services is irrelevant to one's feelings of
optimism and positive affect; however, with some disabil-
ity, and especially with a great deal of disability, the role of
religion becomes very important for one's well-being in
these two domains.
DISCUSSION
What is the relationship between religious involvement
and functional disability? In this study we have looked at
the cross-sectional patterns of religious involvement,
health, health practices, social activities, and subjective
well-being. We have learned from this analysis that reli-
RELIGION AND DISABLED PERSONS S303
gious involvement is tied to a broad array of other resources
in the lives of the elderly respondents. Our theoretical per-
spective led us to expect that the religious involvement
would be beneficial, and it was. Actually, there were 17 de-
pendent variables in this analysis (not counting the religion
measures themselves); 12 of them had main effect associa-
tions with attendance at services in the full sample, and 3 of
them with subjective religious feelings.
Thus, as Durkheimian and Weberian theory would sug-
gest, public religious participation is positively associated
with other types of social roles and activities as different
from each other as exercising and getting together with
family and friends for holidays. We expected the number of
friendship ties and even the closeness of those ties to be en-
hanced by religious group activities, since religious group
membership brings one into wider contact with the commu-
nity, but family ties and closeness appear to be enhanced as
well. Let us underscore that these measures include the
quality as well as the quantity of role involvements.
Our findings fit our theoretical framework well. We see
evidence of the regulation of individual desires for self-
gratification, the integration of individuals in nurturing,
supportive social groups, and the provision of meaning for
individuals in old age, all deriving directly from the behav-
ioral indicator of attendance at religious services. The first
finding of this study, then, is one of substantial main ef-
fects: with just a few exceptions, public religious participa-
tion appears to be part of a broad pattern of positive health
practices, satisfying social relationships, and psychosocial
benefits. The lives of religiously involved elderly persons
are pervasively different from those of the uninvolved.
Although these were our hypotheses, the strength and con-
sistency of these associations exceeded our expectations.
There are limitations to these findings, of which we are
keenly aware. Our measures of religious involvement and
some other key concepts such as optimism are not as psy-
chometrically sound as we would like, and are limited in
scope. We can only hope that these initial findings will pro-
voke more refined investigations fielded with better instru-
ments. Moreover, our study design has been entirely cross-
sectional, limiting our ability to interpret causal direction.
With our findings in Table 2, we cannot say whether the as-
sociation between better functioning and higher levels of
attendance is due to selection processes which keep the dis-
abled from attending, or from pre-baseline causal processes
that have already resulted in measurably better functioning
among regular attenders. We have, however, taken alternate
approaches to the data, employing the measures of religion
as both dependent and independent variables, and have
tried not to oversimplify the complex relationship of reli-
giousness and health. Indeed, even with our two very crude
measures we see differences: attendance (in Table 2) is as-
sociated with less disability, and subjective religiousness is
associated with more. Finally, we would point to the
paucity or almost complete absence of research literature
from representative samples on topics such as religion and
cigarette smoking, or physical activity, or friendship and
kin networks. Given the underdeveloped state of research
on religion and health in general, these cross-sectional find-
ings from a diverse, representative sample tell us a good
deal about why religion should be related to health. To put
it simply, there are many reasons, and our research rules out
none of the possible mechanisms.
Our second finding emerges from our focus on disabled
elderly persons. Our findings of several significant and near-
significant interaction effects showed that the actively reli-
gious among the disabled received particular benefits in
terms of additional contacts and closeness with friends, more
numerous holiday celebrations, more optimism, and more
positive affect. These findings underscore, as many other
studies have, the special relevance of religion for situations
of physical illness and disability. Among fully functional el-
derly persons, friendships, holiday celebrations, optimism,
and positive affect have distributions which do not depend on
religious involvement. This group, with no difficulty in any
of the 15 areas of functioning, is, however, a minority of the
sample. The group with some disability is twice as large, and
here religious participation carries with it more optimism and
positive affect, in addition to more friends and celebrations.
The full sample models show that disability has strong nega-
tive effects on social participation; and yet among the vulner-
able disabled, higher levels of religious participation are
linked to lower levels of social isolation and depression.
A research direction which is suggested by our third
finding is a better understanding of the nature of attendance
at religious services, and how the dynamics differ from the
role of what we have called subjective religious involve-
ment. Our findings, that attendance at worship services is
far more important than subjective religious involvement,
put us in the position of swimming against the tide of much
of the recent literature in studies of religion and aging,
which has directed research interest toward the nonorgani-
zational and subjective aspects of religious involvement
(Krause, 1995; Levin, Taylor, and Chatters, 1994). Our re-
sults suggest that, at least from the perspective of health re-
search, a second look at attendance at services might be
valuable. The argument is often made that religious in-
volvement is multidimensional, that it cannot be captured
by single items about "church attendance" in surveys. It is
apparently thought, if not spoken, that such a single item
measures only the "social" or "belonging" functions of reli-
gion. We would argue, on the other hand, that the single in-
dicator of attendance at services is itself pretty multi-
faceted, and that we ought not to take this valuable bit of
data so lightly by assuming that we know what it means.
There are many dimensions of the human experience of
"attendance at services" that might be useful in understand-
ing its possible beneficial effects on health. There are aes-
thetic elements in the experience of religious worship, in-
cluding music, poetry, painting, sculpture, and architecture,
which may assist believers in reaching a transcendent state.
There is the opportunity for confession and forgiveness of
sins, which could be personal and private, or corporate;
confession of troubles could relieve stress in many areas of
life, and the accompanying forgiveness could reassure the
individual of her value and worth. The performance of rit-
ual in the worship service or the manipulation of the tradi-
tional symbols of the faith, may link the body and the spirit
in the posture of prayer or the receiving of communion. The
reading of sacred texts and the interpretation of them retell
S304 IDLER AND KASL
familiar stories of human and divine relationships. If these
dimensions appear to emphasize the psychological experi-
ence of worship, let us emphasize the social context in
which it takes place. It is one thing to listen to religious
music privately in the home and quite another to participate
by singing with a large group. The religious congregation
also offers clearly social opportunities for voluntary giving
and service, to those in need in the congregation and to oth-
ers at the community, national, and even international level.
Attendance at religious services in our society builds a
foundation for the social support and belonging functions
found in any cohesive social group, and undergirds them
with the ethical principles of Judeo-Christian beliefs about
selflessness and concern for others who are less fortunate.
Durkheim, especially in his late work on religion (1912
[1995]) emphasized the experience of the inward religious
life but never took it far from its social underpinnings.
We can summarize the many findings of this first part of
the research rather simply, by concluding that the lives of re-
ligious elderly persons are different from those of the nonre-
ligious, in ways which most would interpret as enhance-
ments to their quality of life. Moreover, some of these
differences are especially pronounced for disabled elderly
persons in the sample, the group that is precisely at risk for
loss of social opportunities and feelings of well-being.
Knowing these patterns lays a groundwork for the longitudi-
nal analysis that is to follow, in which we examine the role
of religious involvement in the course of disability. We have
identified a set of factors which may help explain the poten-
tial association of religious involvement with functioning.
Knowing that they are unevenly distributed in the sample is
a contribution in itself, however, which we believe makes a
broad contribution to our still rudimentary knowledge of the
role of religion in the lives of elderly people.
