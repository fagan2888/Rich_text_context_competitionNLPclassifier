body fat from anthropometry and isotopic dilution: a four-
country comparison. Obes Res. 2003;11:1553­1562.
Objective: The goal was to assess the ability of BMI to
predict body fat (BF) among youths in four countries and
identify the degree to which additional anthropometric mea-
sures improve this prediction. BMI is widely recommended
as an indicator of overweight. However, whether BMI ad-
equately estimates BF and has the same meaning in differ-
ent ethnic groups and youths has been questioned.
Research Methods and Procedures: Data come from 456
Filipino, Chinese, Russian, and black South African youths,
6 to 16 years old. Percentage BF and fat mass index (FMI)
were estimated by the deuterium dilution method. Skinfold
thicknesses (triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac) and weight
and height measures were collected. Percentage BF was
regressed first on BMI and age and then with the addition of
the skinfold measures. Linear models were run separately
by country and sex. The models were repeated with FMI as
the outcome.
Results: The R2 values from the percentage BF models
ranged from 0.13 to 0.69 in the first models to 0.38 to 0.81
in the full models. The values were lowest among Russian
males  13 years and Russian females  13 years of age in
the reduced and full models, respectively, and were highest
among Chinese females. Using FMI as the outcome did not
meaningfully change the results.
Discussion: The ability of BMI to adequately predict BF and
the additional predictivity of anthropometric measures varied
widely across the samples, making its uniform use as a proxy
for BF in youths from different countries questionable.
Key words: percentage body fat, deuterium dilution,

Introduction
Obesity is an established risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic health problems
(1­3). The prevalence of obesity is increasing among youths
and adults both in developed (4­7) and in developing coun-
tries undergoing the nutrition transition (8­13). For chil-
dren, the studies documenting these important trends often
rely on weight-for-height indices to define overweight or
obesity, despite the fact that excess body fat (BF)1 is the
specific factor associated with increased disease risk. Epi-
demiological studies of obesity could benefit from a simple
and appropriate indicator for adiposity for use in different
age and ethnic groups.
Adiposity may be estimated through in vivo body com-
position methods such as underwater weighing, deuterium
oxide dilution, and radioactive potassium counting (14).
However, these methods are expensive and/or invasive and,
thus, not well suited to large epidemiological studies. In
addition, the assumptions underlying these methods are
population- and age-specific and may not be equally valid
for different age and ethnic groups (14,15). In contrast,
anthropometry is inexpensive, practical, and easy to use in
large population-based field studies, and age- and sex-spe-
cific reference data are available.
The most common anthropometric indicator of BF is
BMI (kilograms per meter squared). Although the World

Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention both recommend BMI as a fatness
indicator across populations (4,16­18), recent findings have
challenged the assumption that BMI has the same meaning
in all ethnic groups (19).
A recent meta-analysis of the relationship between BMI
and percentage BF among Chinese, Ethiopians, Indone-
sians, Polynesians, Thais, American blacks, and American
whites revealed that people of different ethnic groups had
significantly different BMIs at the same levels of BF, age,
and gender (20). Differences in the relationship between
BMI and percentage BF have also been shown in popula-
tions from Singapore (21), Japan (22), and Hong Kong (23)
when compared with American whites. Within the U.S., the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and
Health Study found that the BMI for lean 9-year-old black
children was 3% higher than that for lean white children
of the same age (24). Possible reasons for ethnic differences
in the relationship between BMI and percentage BF include
differences in fat-free body density, the distribution of sub-
cutaneous fat, and limb length relative to trunk size (14,25).
These findings suggest that estimates of BF from anthro-
pometric indicators may produce systematic errors across
different ethnic groups (26). Thus, there has been an urgent
call for further research in diverse populations, especially
those from developing countries (20), to help clarify ethnic
differences in body composition and to develop measures of
BF that allow us to accommodate these differences.
Our study addresses this gap by exploring the ability of a
variety of anthropometric indicators to predict body fatness
in youths from four different countries: the Philippines,
China, South Africa, and Russia. Two different indicators of
body fatness are explored as standards against which the
anthropometric measures are compared. These are percent-
age BF and fat mass (FM) index (FMI) (FM per height
squared), both estimated using the deuterium oxide dilution
method. FMI is included in addition to percentage BF
because percentage BF, commonly considered to be the
standard of body fatness, has been criticized for ignoring
between-subject variation in fat-free mass (FFM) (26). Dif-
ferences in percentage BF between two individuals could
reflect either similarities in FFM and true differences in FM
or could reflect similarities in FM and differences in FFM
(26). This has led to the suggestion that FM and FFM, both
derived from total body water (TBW) through the same
deuterium dilution method used to calculate percentage BF,
be normalized for height by dividing them by height
squared and used as distinct indices of body composi-
tion (26).
Research Methods and Procedures
Subjects
Subjects 6 to 16 years of age were recruited from local
schools in Metropolitan Cebu, Philippines (n  87); Bei-
jing, China (n  91); Moscow, Russia (n  192); and
Johannesburg, South Africa, where all the subjects recruited
were black (n  86). Sample sizes reflect exclusions due to
age 17 years (3 in Cebu), age  6 years (1 in Russia),
implausible values of percentage BF (3) (2 in Russia and
1 in South Africa), missing percentage BF measures (16 in
Cebu, 10 in China, and 7 in South Africa), missing sub-
scapular skinfold (SF) measures (1 in Russia), and measure-
ments that caused violations in the assumptions of normality
and linearity necessary for unbiased use of linear regression,
as will be discussed further later (4 in Cebu, 4 in China, 2
in South Africa, and 5 in Russia). The four country locations
were chosen to help derive estimating equations of percent-
age BF for use in four ongoing longitudinal studies: the
Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, the Chi-
nese Health and Nutrition Survey, the Birth to Ten study in
South Africa, and the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring
Survey. These larger studies have been described in detail
elsewhere (27­30). Parental consent was obtained for all
recruits, and the study protocols were approved locally and
by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of
Public Health Institutional Review Board.
Data Collection
On a specified day, subjects reported to a designated
classroom on arrival at school, after breakfast. Control
saliva samples were immediately collected in special tubes
(Salivette, Starstedt, Newton, NC) by having children chew
on a cotton pellet for 45 to 60 seconds. Each child then
received a 30-g dose of deuterium oxide (99% atom percent
excess; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA),
followed by a tap water rinse. During the equilibration
period, children remained in the specified classroom, with
investigators present, reading or performing light activities.
There was no food intake during the equilibration period,
and water intake was measured and considered in the cal-
culations. Additional saliva samples were collected at 3.0
and 3.5 hours after administration of the deuterium oxide.
The saliva samples were placed in tubes, then frozen and
shipped to the Johns Hopkins Center for Human Nutrition
(Baltimore, Maryland) for analysis. Data collection at all
four sites was completed by personnel who received train-
ing guided by the same techniques and training manuals.
During the wait between the administration of the deute-
rium oxide and the collection of the final saliva samples,
anthropometric measures were taken by highly trained per-
sonnel using standard techniques. Weight was measured to
the nearest 0.1 kg, and height was measured to the nearest
0.1 cm. Triceps, suprailiac, and subscapular SFs were mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 mm. BMI was calculated for each
individual as kilograms per meter squared (2). Children
wore light clothing and were barefoot or wore socks.

Laboratory Analysis
Saliva samples were analyzed for isotopic enrichment by
infrared spectroscopy, as described elsewhere (31). Water
was extracted by vacuum sublimation and condensed in a
dry ice-methanol trap. Deuterium absorbance was measured
in duplicate at 2500 cm1 in a fixed filter, single-beam
infrared analyzer (Miran, Foxboro Analytical Co., South
Norwal, CT). Interassay coefficient of variability was 3%.
The deuterium dilution space was calculated as (D/C)/wt,
where D is the isotope dose, C is the tracer concentration in
saliva at equilibrium, and wt is body weight (kilograms).
TBW was calucated from the deuterium dilution space
assuming that this space corresponds to 104% of TBW.
Results from the samples taken at 3 and 3.5 hours were
averaged.
Calculation of Percentage BF, FMI, and FFM Index
(FFMI)
Percentage BF was estimated based on the assumption
that the water content of FFM (fat-free hydration) is 76%:
%BF  [(weight  TBW/0.76)/weight]  100
where weight is body weight in kilograms and TBW is in
kilograms. FFM was estimated as suggested by Wells (26):
FFM  TBW/FFM hydration
FM was then estimated as follows:
FM  body weight  FFM
FM and FFM were then each divided by height squared to
produce the FMI and the FFMI, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Multilinear regression estimating models were tested sep-
arately for each country and were stratified by sex. Percent-
age BF and FMI were separately regressed on different
combinations of anthropometric measures to identify the
best predictors. Due to the wide age range in the Russian
sample, models using the Russian data were further strati-
fied by age (two strata of 13 and 13 years of age). Age
13 was chosen as the cut point in creating these strata
because it coincides approximately with puberty and be-
cause it makes the two Russian groups comparable in age
with the groups from the other countries. Three sets of
model specifications were tested for each outcome (percent-
age BF and FMI). Model 1 included only BMI and age as
predictors because these are often the only variables avail-
able in large studies and because BMI is recommended by
the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion to define overweight. Model 2 retained BMI and age
and added triceps SF thickness. Triceps is the most com-
monly measured SF and represents limb fat. Model 3 re-
tained BMI, age, and triceps SF and added suprailiac and
subscapular SFs, which measure subcutaneous trunk fat. We
also tested a fourth model using the sum of SFs as a
predictor, but this specification did not improve the model
fit in any of the samples, and in some cases lowered the R2
values. Thus, only Models 1 to 3 are presented.
For each model specified above, several regression diag-
nostics were performed. Cook and Weisberg tests for het-
eroscedasticity indicated no violations. The normality of the
residuals from each model was tested using the Wilkes-
Shapiro test, and subjects whose measurements caused vi-
olations were excluded. After exclusions made due to nor-
mality violations of the residuals, subjects with absolute
values of Studentized residuals  3 and whose exclusions
caused increases of more than three percentage points in the
R2 values for the model under scrutiny were additionally
excluded. Lowess smoothers were used to examine the
assumption of linearity between the independent variables
and the outcomes of interest. Subjects whose measurements
resulted in gross violations of the linearity assumption were
excluded. Subjects who were excluded due to violations
with regard to any one model were excluded from all
analyses to ensure comparability among the models. These
criteria resulted in the exclusion of four subjects from Cebu,
four from China, two from South Africa, and five from
Russia, as mentioned earlier. All analyses were performed
in Stata for Windows (Release 6.0, Stata Corporation, Col-
lege Station, TX).
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Means (SD) for the anthropometric variables and for
age are presented in Table 1. Among males, Russians  13
years of age had the highest mean percentage BF (30.4%),
whereas South Africans had the lowest (19.4%). Among
females, Russians  13 years of age had the highest mean
percentage BF (36.0%), whereas Chinese youths had the
lowest (19.0%). FMI followed the same pattern. Among
males, mean BMI was highest in the sample of Russians 
13 years of age (19.4) and lowest in the South African
sample (16.3). Among females, mean BMI was highest in
the Cebu sample (20.6) and lowest in the sample of Rus-
sians  13 years of age (16.7).
Percentage BF, FMI, BMI, and FFMI with data from all
countries combined were plotted against age among girls in
Figure 1 and among boys in Figure 2. Because only three
children contributed measurements at 6 years of age, they
were excluded from the figures; thus, the figures reflect data
from ages 7 through 16 years. Also, it should be noted that
although the data are pooled, different countries contributed
data to the graph at different ages. The age ranges of the
subjects, again, were 13 to 16 years in Cebu, 8 to 11 years
in China, 4 to 16 years in Russia, and 10 to 12 years in
South Africa. Despite these age differences, the same indi-

viduals contributed to each of the four graphs (percentage
BF, BMI, FMI, and FFMI) at each age in both sexes; thus,
sex-specific comparisons made among the graphs by age are
valid. Among girls, the graphs of percentage BF and FMI
reveal similar shapes, with body fatness beginning high at 7
years of age, falling steadily until 9 years of age, then rising
to its peak between 12 and 13 years of age before falling
again briefly through 14 years of age, and then rising again.
The graph of BMI, however, shows a fairly consistent
increase across age. The graph of FFMI also shows a steady
increase with age, except for one dip between 11 and 12
years. Among boys, the graphs of percentage BF and FMI
show body fatness beginning high at 7 years of age. Fatness
then decreases until 11 years of age, jumps up at 12 years of
age, and then falls, with one small rise on the way, to its
lowest level at 16 years of age. Again, the graphs of BMI
and FFMI show a different shape with adiposity generally
rising with age, aside from a few dips during early adoles-
cence. Although the graphs reveal sex differences between
females and males, the graphs from both sexes are similar in
that they make the shortcomings of BMI apparent: the
graphs of BMI do not track with the graphs of percentage
BF. As Wells (26) has pointed out, BMI is correlated with
both FM and FFM and, thus, can act as a proxy for both but
cannot distinguish between the two. For example, among
both boys and girls, the graphs in Figures 1 and 2 show that
the rise in BMI between 7 and 9 years of age reflects a rise
in FFM, whereas FM and percentage BF actually dropped in
both sexes at the same ages.
Regressions of Percentage BF and FMI on
Anthropometric Measures
The R2 values and mean squared error (MSE) terms from
the regressions both of percentage BF and of FMI are shown
in Table 2. The percentage of variation in percentage BF
explained by the independent variables was highest among
Chinese females (with R2 values ranging from 0.69 to 0.81
from Models 1 to 3, respectively) and was lowest among
Cebu females, Russian males  13 years of age, and Rus-
sian females in both age strata. The R2 values for these
groups ranged from 0.13 among Russian males  13 years
of age in Model 1 to 0.42 among Russian females  13
years of age in Model 3. FMI was predicted with consider-
ably larger R2 values (e.g., a range of increase in R2 values
of 14 to 45 percentage points in Model 1) and much smaller
MSE terms than percentage BF for all groups. That is, the
anthropometric measures explained more of the variation in
FMI than in percentage BF.
The regression coefficients from the regressions of per-
centage BF are shown in Table 3. BMI was positively
associated with percentage BF in all groups and was statis-
tically significant (p  0.05) in all groups except among
Russian males  13 years of age in Model 1. In Model 2,
triceps SF was positively associated with percentage BF in

all groups and was statistically significant among both
males and females in Cebu and South Africa, among Chi-
nese females, and among Russian males  13 years of age.
The direction of the association between BMI and percent-
age BF switched from positive to negative among Russian
males  13 years of age in Model 2, but the association was
not significant. Referring back to Table 2, the gains in the
R2 values with the addition of the triceps SF in Model 2
ranged from 0 percentage points among Chinese males to 25
percentage points among Russian males  13 years of age.
The direction of the association of the subscapular and
suprailiac SFs with percentage BF in Model 3 was incon-
sistent across the populations, across the sexes, and within
the sexes. The subscapular SF was statistically significant
only among Chinese children, and the suprailiac SF was not
statistically significant in any of the groups. With the addi-
tion of the trunkal SFs in Model 3, the association between
BMI and percentage BF switched from a positive to a
negative relationship among Cebu males, but the associa-
tion was not significant. Again referring back to Table 2, the
rise in the R2 values in Model 3 compared with Model 2
ranged from 0 percentage points among Cebu females and
South African males to 7 percentage points among Chinese
males.
The relationship between the independent variables and
FMI was virtually the same in all the groups as it was with
percentage BF as the outcome. Thus, the coefficients from
the models of FMI are not included in Table 3. When
considering all the models in all the groups, there were only
two differences in the direction of associations between
independent variables and the outcome when using FMI as
the outcome instead of percentage BF; in each case, the
associations were not significant. There were more differ-
ences with regard to the significance of the different anthro-
pometric measures, but wherever a particular measurement
was significant using only one of the outcomes, there was
near-significance using the other outcome.
Discussion
When judged by the percentage of variation in percentage
BF accounted for by anthropometric measures, BMI was not
a satisfactory proxy for percentage BF even among Chinese
children, for whom the R2 values in the models tested were
highest. Even with the addition of SFs, the highest R2 value
reached for Chinese females in Model 3 was not as high as
that reached in regressions of percentage BF on a combi-
nation of weight and SF thicknesses in the Pathways mul-

tisite study of obesity in Native American children (31).
This indicates that BMI and other anthropometric proxies
for percentage BF should be used with caution among
children from diverse ethnic groups. There are several pos-
sible explanations for our findings.
In any study where anthropometric measures are per-
formed and laboratory samples are collected, measurement
error and sample handling must be considered. Measure-
ment error was minimized by having trained personnel
perform all measurements using standard procedures. Al-
though it is possible that there were slight differences
among the sites in measurement technique, any errors likely
would be systematic within sites. Proper storage and ship-
ping of the saliva samples were ensured.
Because it was considered to be unethical to require
young children to fast for the duration of time needed for
deuterium dosage and saliva collection (over 3 hours), chil-
dren were allowed a light breakfast before saliva collection.
Although specific dietary intake data were not collected, we
estimate that food caused only a relatively small increase in
TBW during the period of study. Food intake causes an
expansion in TBW due to metabolic water being produced
by the metabolism of food-derived energy. Under the con-
ditions of light physical activity during the study and as-
suming an average respiratory quotient of 0.85, the rate of
expansion of the body water pool during the equilibration
period would have been 0.04% per hour. Such a small
measurement error would neither introduce major biases
into our results nor explain the differences across countries
found in our study. Although food intake also may have
affected weight, it is unlikely that the weight of a light
breakfast differed significantly by site. Thus, any error
introduced would be systematic and would not affect the
validity of our conclusions drawn from comparisons be-
tween the groups. Similarly, because it was not considered
appropriate to weigh adolescents without clothing, all sub-
jects wore light clothing consisting of a t-shirt, shorts, and
socks. Again, because it is unlikely that the weight of such
clothes differed meaningfully by sight, the validity of our
comparisons is not compromised. However, the small sam-
ple sizes available in this study may have affected the fit of
the models.
The assumptions underlying the isotopic dilution method
for estimating BF must also be considered. This method
requires an assumption of the water content of fat-free body
mass. This hydration fraction is known to decrease progres-
sively with age to the adult value of 73%. We used a
hydration fraction of 76% for the age range of the subjects

in our study based on research by Boileau et al. (32), who
reported factors of 75.6% in white and African-American
prepubescent children (mean age 9.8 years) and 75.5% in
pubescent children (mean age 12.8 years). Their data indi-
cate that the hydration of fat-free body mass does not show
larger differences with age until the postadolescent period
and does not reach the adult value of 73% until age 22 years
or later. A hydration fraction of 76% for youths has been
used by other researchers as well (31). Although the use of
a single hydration coefficient for all the ages included in our
study may introduce some error, the magnitude of this error
would be too small to explain the observed between-site
differences in percentage BF. For example, in an extreme
scenario in which the adult FFM hydration fraction (73%)
was used in combination with prepubertal tissue density
(1.050), there would be a 4% error in BF estimates. Age and
sex-specific ethnic differences in hydration of the FFM are
rather minor (14,25,33).
Based on the evidence from Figure 1, BMI does not
distinguish between FM and FFM. Although BMI and FFM
increase steadily with age, FM does not. This indicates that
at some ages, the increase in BMI reflects increases in FFM
rather than FM and, thus, is a poor explanatory factor for the
variability in percentage BF.
One potential reason for the incongruities between BMI
and the other estimates of adiposity is the failure to correct
for level of maturation. In a study exploring the relationship
of BMI to percentage FM (PFM) in German youths, Shaefer
et al. (34) found that correction for pubertal stage signifi-
cantly improved the prediction of PFM from BMI. For
instance, in boys, the total explained variance of PFM was
increased from 29% to 66% when pubertal stage defined by
the Tanner method (35) was included in a model regressing
PFM on BMI. In our data, the coefficients for BMI were
significant in all three models of percentage BF for Russian
males  13 years of age but were not significant in any of
the models for Russian males  13 years of age, differences
that may reflect the effects of puberty. Precise measures of
maturation were available only for the Cebu boys, for whom
pubertal stage data were collected. Surprisingly, inclusion
of maturation corrections did not produce a more precise
prediction equation in this case. Maturation stage was not
measured among Cebu girls or in the other three samples,
leaving open the possibility that maturation might matter in
these other groups.
BMI and SFs explained more variation, and with lower
MSE values, in FMI than in percentage BF. In Figure 1, we
see that trends in FMI and percentage BF are quite compa-
rable and include large dips with age, whereas BMI in-
creased steadily with age. Thus, the improvement of the fit
of the models when using FMI as the outcome rather than
percentage BF is most likely the result of both BMI and
FMI being adjusted for height in the same manner. Thus,
although BMI has the same problem with regard to its
relationship with FMI that it does with percentage BF--
namely that it cannot distinguish fat from FFM--it does a

better job of explaining the variability of FMI by virtue of
their shared manner of controlling for body size.
Differences in the significance and direction of the an-
thropometric predictors of percentage BF between the pop-
ulations and sexes suggest differences in BF distribution.
For example, although SF thicknesses were important pre-
dictors of percentage BF in Chinese males and females, they
were not significant predictors of percentage BF in Russian
male and females  13 years of age, and the R2 values for
the Russian groups  13 years of age were low. This could
indicate, for example, that Russian children  13 years of
age had more subcutaneous fat that cannot be measured
through SFs, whereas the Chinese children had more limb
and trunk fat that was easily measured.
This paper contributes to the existing literature in several
ways. It responds to the growing need for body composition
research in diverse ethnic groups, it explores whether FMI
might be more easily predicted by anthropometric measures

than percentage BF, and it determines whether combining
SF measures with BMI can improve the prediction of per-
centage BF over the use of BMI alone within the study
population.
The conclusions drawn from this research reflect the
complex nature of body composition research. First,
changes in BMI represent changes in FFM in addition to
changes in FM. In children undergoing dramatic changes in
body composition, BMI is a poor proxy for adiposity. BMI
is a better indicator of adiposity in adults, in whom dramatic
changes in FFM are not common (in the absence of major
disease), and weight changes mainly reflect shifts in FM.
Second, future studies that relate anthropometric indicators
to more direct measures of BF need to explore further the
influence of maturation levels. Third, the ability of BMI and
SF measures to predict adiposity differs substantially among
children of different ethnic groups, which may reflect dif-
ferences in fat distribution. Thus, tailored estimating equa-
tions that take into account such differences should be used
when studying body composition in youths from different
ethnic groups.
