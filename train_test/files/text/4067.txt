Abstract
Objective: To determine the effect of radial forearm free (RFF) flap harvest on patient-reported
postoperative upper extremity disability.
Methods: Patients undergoing RFF flap reconstruction following resection of head and neck
cancer were recruited and matched with similar patients undergoing non-RFF reconstruction. All
subjects completed the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire
preoperatively and at least 1 year postoperatively.
Results: Postoperative DASH scores were significantly higher (more severe disability) in patients
undergoing RFF flap reconstruction (6.93 Æ 5.54; n ¼ 52) compared with those undergoing non-
RFF flap surgeries (2.95 Æ 4.42; n ¼ 52). Preoperative DASH score, flap size, patient age and
tumour stage were significantly correlated with postoperative DASH score.
Conclusion: Excluding the effect of neck dissection, RFF flap reconstruction has a significant
deleterious effect on upper extremity function.

Introduction
The radial forearm free (RFF) flap was
introduced in 19811 and has become widely
used in reconstructive head and neck sur-
gery. The procedure is useful for repairing
head and neck defects, as it provides reliable
anatomy, long pedicle length, good size
vessels, sufficient skin thickness and lack
of hair.2,3 Donor site complications can
arise, however, including poor cosmetic
appearance and functional morbidity fol-
lowing the sacrifice of a major artery.4­8

RFF flaps have been found to have widely
varying effects on hand function,4­11 but
studies of their effect on upper extremity
function are few and have failed to take into
consideration the possible effect of neck
dissection.4,5,8,9 The aim of the present pro-
spective matched-pair study was to deter-
mine the effect of the RFF flap on upper
extremity function.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited consecutive patients
undergoing RFF flap reconstruction follow-
ing resection of head and neck cancer at the
Department of Oral and Maxillofacial
Surgery Tumour Centre, China Medical
University, Liaoning, China, between
January 2008 and December 2011. The
control group comprised individuals
undergoing non-RFF flap reconstruction
surgeries following resection of head and
neck cancer. They were also recruited
between January 2008 and December 2011.
Control subjects were matched to patients
by age (Æ5 years), sex, primary cancer site
and neck treatment (selective neck dissec-
tion; modified radical neck dissection). All
tumours were graded according to the
Union for International Cancer Control
(UICC) classification system.12
All study subjects were asked to complete
the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and
Hand (DASH) questionnaire13 preopera-
tively and !1 year postoperatively. The
DASH questionnaire measures upper
extremity disabilities from the patient's per-
spective, and evaluates disability regardless
of which arm, shoulder or hand the patient
uses to perform the activity. The question-
naire comprises 30 items, with a higher score
indicating more severe disability.
The institutional research committee of
China Medical University approved the
study and all participants provided written
informed consent.
RFF flap reconstruction
In RFF flap reconstruction, flap elevation in
the left arm and recipient site surgery were
performed simultaneously to shorten the
total duration of surgery. The radial artery
and cephalic vein were used as donor vessels
and closure of the donor site was performed
via full-thickness skin graft from the abdo-
men. The lower arm was immobilized in a
splint, and the first bandage change was
performed on the fifth day postoperatively.
Postoperative flap control was performed
hourly during the first 24 h and then every
4 h for the next 2 days.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or
median (range). Between-group compari-
sons were made with paired t-test.
Pearsons's and Spearman's correlation ana-
lyses were used to determine the predictive
factors for postoperative DASH score.
Statistical analyses were conducted using
SPSSÕ version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study recruited 69 patients with RFF
flap reconstruction, 17 of whom died during
follow-up and so were excluded from the
final analysis. The study therefore included a
total of 52 cases (34 male/18 female; mean
age 55.6 Æ 9.1 years; age range: 33­72 years).
All patients received unilateral or bilateral
neck dissections: 47 cases were selective neck
dissection (SND) and five cases were mod-
ified radical neck dissection (MRND).
According to the UICC classification
system,12 one tumour was stage T1, 11
were T2, 20 were T3 and 20 were T4. The
primary cancer sites were: tongue, 24 cases;
floor of mouth, 12 cases; gingiva, 7 cases;
cheek, 8 cases; and lip, one case. The mean
flap size was 58.9 cm2 (range: 24­150 cm2).

Partial necrosis occurred in four skin grafts
and there were no total failures. All flaps
survived, but three required immediate re-
exploration because of complications
(haematoma).
The control group comprised 52 patients
(34 male/18 female; mean age 55.8 Æ 9.3
years; age range: 34­75 years). Reconstruction
methods were primary closure (n¼ 6), pla-
tysma myocutaneous flap (n¼ 8), submental
island flap (n¼ 8) and anterolateral thigh flap
(n¼ 30).
In the RFF flap group, postoperative
DASH scores were significantly higher than
preoperative scores (6.93 Æ 5.54 vs. 2.58 Æ
3.44; P < 0.001). There was no significant
difference in preoperative and postoperative
DASH scores in the control group, however
(2.28 Æ 3.32 and 2.95 Æ 4.42, respectively).
Postoperative DASH scores were signifi-
cantly higher in the RFF flap group than
the control group (6.93 Æ 5.54 vs. 2.95 Æ
4.42; P < 0.001).
Correlation analysis showed that pre-
operative DASH score (r ¼ 0.851,
P < 0.001), flap size (r ¼ 0.293, P ¼ 0.035),
patient age (r ¼ 0.417, P ¼ 0.002) and
tumour stage (r ¼ 0.333, P ¼ 0.016) were
significantly associated with postoperative
DASH score.
Discussion
The shoulder is an important component of
the upper extremity, and any shoulder
impairment is likely to lead to upper extrem-
ity dysfunction. The effects of SND and
MRND on shoulder function are insuffi-
ciently investigated, with studies reporting
varying levels of impairment.14­16 It has
been shown that non-SND reconstruction
is a risk factor for a restricted range of
shoulder motion, but the follow-up time of
this study was extremely short and only
16.7% of patients underwent RFF flap
reconstruction.17 Other studies have found
that the use of a pectoralis major flap
induced shoulder dysfunction.18 Control
patients undergoing non-RFF flap recon-
struction in the present study had slightly
higher postoperative DASH scores than
preoperative scores, but this was not statis-
tically significant. In order to exclude the
effect of neck dissection and directly evalu-
ate the role of RFF flap surgery in upper
extremity morbidity, patients in the pre-
sent study were matched with a control
patient undergoing non-RFF flap
reconstruction.
The effects of SND and MRND on
shoulder function are insufficiently investi-
gated. Studies have variously reported 25%
of patients with forearm disabilities,4 none
or minimal disability in the majority of
patients (58.3%),8 and moderate or extreme
dysfunction in most cases (exact data not
available).5 This between-study variation
may be due to differences in sample size. A
further study demonstrated disability of the
upper extremity by analysing donor forearm
supination and pronation and reported a
significant reduction in the range of motion,
but the follow-up time was only 5­8 days.9
All of these studies were retrospective, and
the scales used to evaluate disability were
simplistic or designed by the authors them-
selves, limiting the validity of the data. The
present study used the DASH question-
naire,13 which is multifactorial and has
sufficient detail to identify subtle changes.
In addition, the questionnaire is brief and
self-administered, and reflects the disability
perceived by the patient. This scale has been
validated in several studies.5,8,11
There are few prospective studies regard-
ing the effect of RFF flap reconstruction on
function. When preoperative and postopera-
tive forearms were compared with nonoper-
ated forearms, there were statistically
significant differences in wrist flexion,
pinch strength and sensation, but no sub-
jective complaints of loss of function by any
patient.10 Others found small reductions in
forearm circumference and wrist mobility,
Fang et al. 233
and restricted function of the donor arm in
16% of patients after fasciocutaneous RFF
flap harvest.19 In a series of 50 patients
undergoing RFF flap harvest, grip power
and wrist flexion were significantly
decreased after surgery compared with pre-
operative values.20 In contrast to the present
report, none of these studies took the pos-
sible effect of neck dissection into account.
The current data show that RFF flap recon-
struction significantly increased upper
extremity disability compared with pre-
operative function. It should be noted,
however, that the current patients were
evaluated at least 1 year after surgery, and
had been prescribed post-discharge physical
therapy. Others have shown that disability
improved with time, and rehabilitation
played an important role in promoting
function and reducing pain.9,21­24
Some studies have focused on wrist
mobility, but the effect of RFF flap harvest
on this parameter is unclear.7­10 In addition,
it has been shown that objective measure-
ments do not accurately reflect the patient's
experience.4,6 This may be because the
majority of RFF flaps are harvested from
the non-dominant arm, and the reduction in
wrist motion was not severe enough to
impact significantly on daily life. The pre-
sent study therefore did not analyse wrist
mobility because of its limited clinical
significance.
Older age was predictive of high post-
operative DASH score in the present study,
conversely to the findings of others.5 The
current study is the first to report the
correlations between postoperative function
and preoperative DASH score, flap size and
tumour stage. Further studies are required
to clarify these findings, in particular the
relationship between postoperative function
and tumour stage.
In conclusion, excluding the effect of neck
dissection, RFF flap reconstruction has a
significant deleterious effect on upper
extremity function.
