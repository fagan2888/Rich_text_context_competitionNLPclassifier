Abstract
Introduction Public health initiatives to immunize children
and adults have effectively reduced the number of tetanus
cases in the USA. However, in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), immigrants
from Mexico had a 67% nonprotective anti-tetanus antibody
(ATA) level. Less work has been conducted among other
vulnerable populations such as human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)-infected patients. The objective of this study was
to measure ATA levels among the HIV immigrant population
compared with US-born HIV-infected patients.
Methods A convenience sample of 158 HIV-infected indi-
viduals was recruited to determine the levels of ATA. A
nonprotective level of ATAwas defined as below 0.15 IU/ml.
Results Among the HIV-infected patients, 72% (114/158)
were born in the USA. A total of 17% (27/158) lacked
protective levels of ATA. A total of 6.1% (7/114) of those born
in the USA lacked protection, compared to 45% (20/44) born
outside the USA (p<0.0001).
Conclusion The results illustrate that the country of birth is
an important predictor of ATA protection, even among
HIV-infected patients.

Introduction
Tetanus is characterized by generalized rigidity and spasm
of skeletal muscles that often progresses to respiratory
failure and death. The clinical manifestations of tetanus are
caused by the exotoxins made by Clostridium tetani, a
gram-positive, anaerobic rod, which is found in soil, animal
intestines and faeces [1]. The causative agent enters the
human body through a wound where the toxins are
produced and spreads via blood and lymphatics in order
to wreak havoc on neurotransmitter release in the central
nervous system.
Newly reported cases of tetanus-related deaths have
dropped steadily since the introduction of tetanus toxoid
into routine childhood immunization in the late 1940s [1, 2].
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommends that the first four doses of diphthe-
ria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine in childhood be
administered at ages 2, 4, 6 and 15­18 months. The fifth
dose is given at age 4­6 years with a subsequent tetanus
and diphtheria toxoid (Td) booster given at age 11­12 years
and then every 10 years thereafter [1, 3]. Since 2005, an
adult tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine has been
available for adult patients under the age of 65 [4].
During the period of 1998­2000, an average of 43 tetanus
cases was reported annually in the USA [2]. It has been well
documented that the elderly are less likely to have adequate

tetanus titres [2, 5­7]. Other patient populations, such as
immigrants to the USA (foreign born), are also less likely to
have protection against tetanus. In one study, 84% of adult
immigrants over the age of 50 years did not have protective
titres to tetanus compared to 21% of US-born individuals in
the same age group [8]. In another study, 18% of im-
migrants lacked seroprotection despite a history of adequate
immunization [9].
Another population that may be vulnerable to tetanus are
individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) [10, 11]. Previous serosurveys have suggested
that HIV-infected patients are less likely to have adequate
anti-tetanus antibodies (ATA). The progressive decline of
CD4 levels in HIV-infected individuals could potentially
lead to lost immunity to tetanus [10­12]. We speculate that
immigrant status within the HIV patient population may
confer an additional negative impact on tetanus immunity.
To determine whether the loss of immunity among HIV
patients residing in the USA is a function of country of
birth, this study quantifies ATA levels among HIV-infected
persons born in the USA compared to those born in foreign
countries and immigrated to the USA.
Methods
A convenience sample of HIV adult patients was recruited
from an HIVoutpatient centre based at a university teaching
hospital from October 2006 through October 2007. To be
eligible, individuals needed to be infected with HIV, be
18 years of age or older and agree to participate. A
structured interview was conducted requesting age, gender,
country of birth, military service, history of intravenous
drug use, HIV infection and previous tetanus immunization.
Serum samples were obtained and stored at -30°C for batch
testing. Levels of ATA were measured using an antigen-
specific IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
kit (Bindazyme, The Binding Site, Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA). A nonprotective level of ATA was defined as below
0.15 IU/ml, as per the manufacturer's recommendations.
Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Student's t-
test and chi-squared analysis, and a p value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The study was approved
by the Human Subjects Review Committee at the North
Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System and written
informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Results
There were 158 HIV-infected subjects enrolled in the study.
The mean age was 46 years (SD: 10.2, range: 22­71), 64%
(101/158) were male and 72% (114/158) were born in the
USA. A total of 17% (27/158) lacked protective levels of
ATA. In a univariate analysis, neither age nor gender
predicted ATA protection. However, the country of birth
was associated with ATA protective levels. A total of 6.1%
(7/114) of those born in the USA lacked protection,
compared to 45% (20/44) born outside the USA (p<0.0001).
Since lower tetanus immunity has been reported with
age greater than 50 years [2, 5­7, 13] we evaluated whether
age differences in relation to country of birth accounted for
the observed differences in protection. The mean age of
those born in the USA was similar to those born outside the
USA (47.5 years vs 45.1 years, p=0.154). Further, the
number of individuals over 50 years born in the USA (40/
114, 35%) was similar to the number over 50 years and
born outside the USA (15/44, 34%, p=0.906).
Table 1 shows a detailed breakdown of age by decade,
country of birth and immunity to tetanus. Overall, the
frequency of ATA protection appeared lower in those born
outside of the USA for the age groups shown when compared
to those born in the USA. Of note, regardless of where the
individual was born, there was a general trend for levels of
protection to be lower in the youngest and the oldest groups.
Within the US-born group the differences by age were sta-

tistically significant (p=0.001); within those born outside the
USA the difference trends were also significant (p=0.033).
The frequency of protection of individuals born outside
the USA somewhat varied when the general place of birth
was evaluated (see Table 2). With regards to military
service 2/44 (4.5%) of the foreign born served in the
military of their country and of the US born 10/114 (8.8%)
served in the US military. Only two of these persons, both
of whom served in the US military, had non-immune titres.
Regarding intravenous drug use 26/114 (23%) of US-born
subjects admitted to past or current usage, while only one
of those born outside the USA indicated IV drug usage
(IVDU). All of the IVDU patients had immune titres. Data
regarding past immunizations were not analysed as most
patients (59%) were unsure of their history.
Discussion
Upon arrival to the USA, immigrants are required to show
proof of tetanus immunization or receive the appropriate
vaccinations to confer immunity. Despite this mandate, this
study shows that the foreign-born individuals infected with
HIV often do not have protective titres to tetanus compared
to US/Puerto Rican-born HIV-infected individuals. The
results illustrate that the country of birth is an important
predictor of ATA protection, even among HIV-infected
patients. These results are consistent with seroprevalence
studies of immigrant groups in the general USA population,
where 67% of Mexican Americans born outside the USA
lack protection [14], and 86% of Korean Americans born
outside the USA lack protection [9].
Much has been written in the literature regarding declining
tetanus immunity in older patients with one study using an age
cut-off of 50 years [2, 5­8, 13]. The ACIP guidelines have
recommended that all patients 50 years and older be
evaluated for completeness to tetanus and other immuniza-
tion recommendations [15]. In our study, there were no
differences in age between the USA and non-US-born
subjects, so age did not explain these patterns of immunity.
We speculate that either inadequate immunization practices
in the countries of origin or poor individual compliance with
decennial tetanus boosters may contribute to these differ-
ences. If so, vaccination history for immigrants at the time of
US entry would require more rigorous scrutiny.
Among our study limitations are the over-sampling of
men and testing a population from one region in New York,
USA. While 66% of HIV-infected individuals enrolled in
the study were men, it reflects the current epidemiology of
the HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
epidemic where the majority of cases occur among males
[16]. Other limitations include patients not being asked
about their primary medical care, when they immigrated to
the USA or the amount of years spent living in this country.
In summary, for US-born individuals followed at an HIV
clinic, having HIV does not appear to influence tetanus
immune status. In our population of HIV-infected adults,
97% of US-born individuals had protective antibodies to
tetanus (mean age 45), which is broadly similar to a 90%
seroprevalence found in the general USA population (mean
age 37) [7]. It is still unclear from this study whether a low
level of ATA among foreign-born patients infected with
HIV is due to being non-immunized, inadequately immu-
nized or having lost immunity and further study is needed
to address this. It is possible that those born in the USA
may receive better primary and secondary immunization,
better care for their HIV or both. Pending further study,
clinicians who care for HIV patients born outside the USA
should be aware they are less likely to have tetanus
protection. For the outpatient provider this means taking a
careful history for previous primary or secondary immuni-
zation, or checking ATA titres. For the emergency physi-
cian this means ensuring adequate immunization when
treating routine wounds or considering providing tetanus
immunoglobulin (TIG) for high-risk populations with
substantial wounds.
