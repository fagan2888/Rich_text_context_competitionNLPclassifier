To estimate the risk and population attributable risk of
prehypertension that is due to abdominal obesity in
White, Black and Hispanic American adults. To deter-
mine how much of the relative difference in the risk of
prehypertension between high-risk Blacks and Hispa-
nics and the low-risk group Whites that is attributable to
their differences in abdominal obesity. Data (n ¼ 4016)
from the 1999 to 2000 US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys were used in this study. Abdom-
inal obesity was defined as waist circumference X102
and X88 cm in men and women, respectively. Prehy-
pertension was defined as not being on antihyperten-
sive medication and having systolic blood pressure of
120­139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 80­
89 mmHg. Odds ratio from the logistic regression
analysis was used to estimate the risk of prehyperten-
sion that was due to abdominal obesity. To estimate
prehypertension risk differences between low-risk
Whites and high-risk Blacks and Hispanics that was
due to abdominal obesity, we estimated relative attribu-
table risk. Statistical adjustments were made for age,
blood glucose, total cholesterol, current smoking and
exercise. Abdominal obesity was associated with in-
creased odds of prehypertension in Whites, Blacks and
Hispanics. In men, abdominal obesity was associated
with 44, 90 and 98% increased odds of prehypertension
in Whites, Blacks and Hispanics, respectively. The
corresponding values in women were 112, 198 and
104%. Proportions of risk of prehypertension explained
by abdominal obesity were 15.2, 22 and 25.8% in White
men, Black men and Hispanic men, respectively. The
corresponding values in women were 38.8, 58.6 and
32.5%. Approximately, 7% of the differences in the risk of
developing prehypertension between White and Black
men and between White and Hispanic men may be
attributable to differences in rates of abdominal obesity.
The analogous values for women were B39.7 and
B16.5%, respectively. In conclusion, despite having
lower rates of abdominal obesity than their counterparts,
Black men, Hispanic men and Hispanic women had high
population attributable risks, indicating that factors other
than abdominal obesity may have important explanatory
power for racial differences in prehypertension in these
groups. However, in Black women reduction in risk of
prehypertension could be possible by instituting public
health measures to reduce abdominal obesity to the
levels seen in White women. Intervention programmes
designed to reduce overall obesity may also lead to
reduction of abdominal obesity, and consequently may
curb prehypertension in these population groups. Life-
style modification, including diet and exercise, may have
public health significance in reducing the incidence of
prehypertension in these populations.

Introduction
Recently, two expert panels made two important
recommendations with respect to cardiovascular
and coronary heart diseases.1,2 In 1998, the National
Institute of Health (NIH) expert panel recommended
practical guidelines for the identification, evalua-
tion and treatment of overweight and obesity in
American adults. Among its recommendations was
the use of abdominal obesity as an important factor
for identifying increased relative risk for obesity
comorbidities.1 In 2003, the Joint National Commit-
tee (JNC-7) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,

and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in their
seventh report defined a new guideline for hyper-
tension prevention and management.2 JNC-7 defined
a new category of abnormal blood pressure, pre-
hypertension. According to JNC-7, patients with
prehypertension are at increased risk for advance-
ment to hypertension. The NIH expert panels
recognize abdominal obesity as a major cardiovas-
cular risk factor, while the JNC-7 committees
recognize the need for early identification of
subjects with abnormal blood pressure values that
are likely to lead to hypertension.
Increased abdominal obesity is associated with
many diseases, including type II diabetes,3,4 hyper-
tension5,6 and cardiovascular disease mortality.7­9
Abdominal obesity is also highly correlated with
impairment of body homeostasis characterized by
abnormalities such as hyperinsulinaemia, glucose
intolerance and dyslipidaemias (hypertriglyceridae-
mia, high levels of low-density lipoprotein and low
levels of high-density cholesterol).10­15 Abdominal
obesity, defined as waist circumference value of
102 cm or greater in men, and 88 cm or greater in
women is associated with increased relative risk for
obesity comorbidities for most adults.1 Proposed
originally by Lean et al16 and Han et al,17 these waist
circumference cut points were proposed for health
promotion to give optimal enrichment to indivi-
duals in need of weight management because of
overweight/obesity or central obesity.
JNC-7 defined prehypertension as systolic blood
pressure of 120­139 mmHg or diastolic blood pres-
sure of 80­89 mmHg in adults 18 years and older.2
According to JNC-7, patients with prehypertension
are at increased risk for advancement to hyper-
tension.2 These prehypertension subjects should be
considered for health-promoting lifestyles to pre-
vent cardiovascular diseases.2 Thus, the classifica-
tion of prehypertension by JNC 7 underscores
the need for public education to decrease blood
pressure levels and avert the development of
hypertension.
Many studies investigating the association be-
tween adiposity and blood pressure are often
restricted to conceptual frameworks where
abnormal blood pressures are defined using systolic
blood pressure of 140 mmHg or greater and diastolic
blood pressure of 90 mmHg or greater.18­20 To our
knowledge, the association between abdominal
obesity and prehypertension among and between
various US racial/ethnic groups has not
been investigated. The objective of this investi-
gation was therefore to estimate the risk and
attributable risk of prehypertension that is due to
abdominal obesity in White, Black and Hispanic
American adults. We also sought to determine how
much of the relative difference in the risk of
prehypertension between high-risk groups (Blacks
and Hispanics) and the low-risk group (Whites)
could be explained by their differences in abdom-
inal obesity.
Methods
Data source
Data from the 1999 to 2000 US National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) as
provided by National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) were used in this study. These datasets were
from cross-sectional surveys that were carried out
among noninstitutionalized US civilian popula-
tions. Descriptions of the plan and operation of
these surveys have been described by other inves-
tigators.21­23 Briefly, NHANES 1999­2000 is the
most recent of the health examination surveys
carried out by NCHS. NHANES 1999­2000 was a
stratified multistage probability sample based on
selection of counties, blocks, households, and
persons within households. About 9965 persons
completed the NHANES 1999­2000 survey.
In the NHANES 1999­2000 survey, the technique
used to obtain blood pressure was based on the latest
recommendations of the American Heart Association.24
Three and sometimes four blood pressure measure-
ments were taken on all eligible individuals using a
mercury sphygmomanometer. Participants who are 50
years and older who were unable to travel to the
mobile examination units were offered an abbreviated
examination in their homes.25 Waist measurements
were made at the natural waist midpoint between the
lowest aspect of the rib cage and highest point of the
iliac crest, and to the nearest 0.1cm.
Only adults who were identified as non-Hispanic
White, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Americans
between 18 and 79 years old were included in this
investigation. This study was also restricted to
subjects who were measured for waist circumfer-
ences and blood pressures. Women who were
pregnant at the time of the surveys were excluded
from this analysis. In terms of variables we did not
consider for our analysis, those who were excluded
due to missing variables of interest were not different
from the population examined in our study.
Definition of terms
Abdominal obesity was defined as waist circumfer-
ence X102 and X88 cm for men and women,
respectively.1 Prehypertension was defined as not
being on antihypertensive medication and having
systolic blood pressure of 120­139 mmHg or dias-
tolic blood pressure of 80­89 mmHg.2
Statistical analysis
Statistical programs available in SAS for Windows26
and SUDAAN27 were utilized for this analysis.
To account for unequal probabilities of selection,
oversampling, and nonresponse, appropriate sample
weights were utilized for the analyses. Standard
errors estimates were calculated using the SUDAAN

statistical program by means of the delete 1 jack-
knife method,28 partitioning the sample into 52
replicates by deleting one unit at a time.
Waist circumference was normalized using Log10
.
Racial/ethnic differences in continuous and catego-
rical variables were assessed using one-way analysis
of variance and w2 statistics, respectively. Sex and
race/ethnic-specific association between abdominal
obesity and prehypertension was determined using
odds ratios from the logistic regression analysis. In
the regression models, statistical adjustments were
made for age, blood glucose, total cholesterol,
exercise and current smoking, Prevalences of ab-
dominal obesity and prehypertension were age-
adjusted by direct methods using the 2000 US
population census data.
Public health consequences of abdominal obesity
for prehypertension were quantified using popula-
tion attributable risk (PAR) expressed in percentage.
The population attributable risk was estimated as29
PE
ðOR À 1Þ
1 þ PE
ðOR À 1Þ
100 ð1Þ
where PE
is the prevalence of abdominal obesity and
OR is the odd ratio comparing individuals with
abdominal obesity with those who were not abdom-
inally obese. PAR, also called population attributa-
ble risk, is defined as the proportion of a
population's disease rate that would not occur if
the risk factor(s) of interests had been absent.29
To estimate the fraction of White to non-White
differences in rate of prehypertension that was due to
their relative differences in the prevalence of abdom-
inal obesity, we estimated relative attributable risk in
percentage (RAR). RAR is defined as the proportion
of the excess disease rate in the high-risk population
that would disappear if the high-risk population had
the same prevalence of risk factor(s) as the low-risk
population.30 RAR is based on the assumption that
the association between abdominal obesity and
prehypertension is causal. RAR was estimated as:31,32

ð2Þ
where PH and PL denote the prevalence on pre-
hypertension in high-risk (Blacks and Hispanics) and
low-risk group (Whites), respectively. PLH is the rate
of prehypertension in the high-risk group if the
distribution of abdominal obesity is identical to that
low-risk group. R ¼ PL/PH denotes the rate ratio of
prehypertension rates of the two groups.31,32 Assum-
ing the relation between prehypertension and ab-
dominal obesity was homogenous across groups,
PLH/PH was estimated as follows:33

denote rates of prehypertension in the ith abdominal
obesity category among non-Whites and abdominal
obesity prevalence of the ith category in Whites,
respectively (i ¼ 0, y, K; i ¼ 0 refers to the reference

RAR was estimated as

prehypertension as Whites

In order to determine whether abdominal obesity
had the same effect for prehypertension in the three
ethnic groups, we compared risk functions in the
logistic regression model using prehypertension as
the dependent variable and abdominal obesity as the
independent variable, adjusting for age, blood
glucose, total cholesterol, current smoking and
exercise. The relative size of the coefficients for
prehypertension from the logistic regression model
was compared using the formula w2 ¼

Results
Descriptive characteristics of the studied popula-
tions are presented in Table 1. Overall, 2041 men
and 1975 women were eligible for this investigation.
The mean age for all ethnic groups fell within
the range of 18­85 years with White men and
White women being significantly older than
their Black and Hispanic counterparts (Po0.01).
White men had significantly higher mean values
of waist circumferences and higher prevalence of
abdominal obesity compared to Black and Hispanic
men (Po0.01). The mean cholesterol value
for White men and White women were slightly
greater than the clinically recommended values.
There were no statistically significant racial ethnic
differences in mean values of diastolic and systolic
blood pressures in men. Black women displayed
significantly higher mean values of weight, body

mass index, waist circumference, blood pressures,
blood glucose, and showed higher prevalences of
abdominal obesity and prehypertension as com-
pared to White women and Hispanic women
(Po0.05).
The association between abdominal obesity and
prehypertension was quantified using odds ratios
computed in racial/ethnic-specific multiple logistic
regression models, adjusting for age, blood glucose,
total cholesterol, exercise and current smoking
(Table 2). Overall, abdominal obesity was asso-
ciated with increased odds of prehypertension in
Whites, Blacks and Hispanics. The maximum odds
ratio of prehypertension that was associated with
abdominal obesity was observed in Black women
while the minimum odds ratio was observed in
White men. In men, abdominal obesity was
associated with 44, 90 and 98% increased odds of
prehypertension in Whites, Blacks and Hispanics,
respectively. The corresponding values in women
were 112, 198 and 104%.
Table 3 represents estimates of population attri-
butable risk of abdominal obesity for prehyperten-
sion, and prehypertension risk differences between
Whites and non-Whites that were associated with
abdominal obesity. In men, the population attribu-
table risks ranged from 15.2% in Whites to 25.8% in
Hispanics. The corresponding values for women
ranged from 32.5% in Hispanics to 58.6% in Blacks.
As shown, 6.5 and 6.9% of the differences in risk
of developing prehypertension between White and
Black men and between White and Hispanic men
may be attributable to differences in abdominal
obesity, independent of age, blood glucose, total
cholesterol, exercise and current smoking. The
analogous values for women were 39.7 and 16.5%,
respectively.
The test of abdominal obesity response for
prehypertension across race/ethnicity provides
further evidence that abdominal obesity had differ-
ent effect for prehypertension in the different racial­
ethnic groups. There were significant differences
between Blacks and Whites and between Hispanics
and Whites in terms of effect of abdominal obesity
on prehypertension (Po0.05).
Discussion
Although there is a substantial body of literature
linking abdominal obesity with many cardiovascu-
lar diseases and cardiovascular disease risk factors,
we are unaware of any study linking abdominal
obesity with prehypertension in the US racial/

ethnic groups. Hence, in this study, we took
advantage of 1999­2000 US cross-sectional surveys
to describe the association between abdominal
obesity and prehypertension in White, Black and
Hispanic American adults.
In epidemiological studies of hypertension, much
attention are focused on estimating population
attributable risks and odds ratio of potential risk
factors of abnormal blood pressures.6,34­36 Relatively
little attentions are paid to the important question
of: how much of the relative differences in the
prevalence of abnormal blood pressures between
two populations is explained by the differences in
pattern of exposure to a particular risk factor? Hence
in this investigation we estimated the fraction of
White to non-White differences in risk of prehyper-
tension that was due to White to non-White
differences in rates of abdominal obesity.
This is the first investigation to use the new
category of prehypertension as defined by the
Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detec-
tion, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood
Pressure in their seventh report.2 The use of the
NHANES 1999­2000 surveys represents the best
available data for this analysis because of its
representativeness and national in scope. The
training programme and quality control measures
instituted in the surveys give an added reliability
to the data.
The main finding from this investigation is that
abdominal obesity is associated with increased risk
of prehypertension in American men and women. In
this study, abdominal obesity was associated with
increased risk of prehypertension in Whites, Blacks
and Hispanics, independent of age, blood glucose,
total cholesterol, exercise and current smoking.
Proportions of risk of prehypertension explained
by abdominal obesity were 15.2, 22 and 25.8% in
White, Black and Hispanic men, respectively. The
analogous values in women were 38.8, 58.6 and
32.5%. These attributable values indicate that
prehypertension could have been avoided if abdom-
inal obesity was absent in both men and women of
the three ethnic groups.
The data further indicated gender differences in
the response of abdominal obesity for prehyperten-
sion. In men, abdominal obesity accounted B7% of
ethnic differences on the risk of developing
prehypertension between Whites and Blacks, and
between Whites and Hispanics. The positive values
for relative attributable risks in Black men, Hispa-
nic men and Hispanic women despite having lower
rates of abdominal obesity than their White
counterparts may indicate that other factors may
have important explanatory power for racial differ-
ences in prehypertension in these groups than
abdominal obesity. In women, 39.5 and 16.5% of
racial/ethnic differences on the risk of developing
prehypertension between Whites and Blacks, and
between Whites and Hispanics were due to their
relative differences in rates of abdominal obesity.
Thus, if Black and Hispanic women had the same
prevalence of abdominal obesity as the rates that
were observed in White women, the risk of
prehypertension would be reduced by B40 and
B17%, respectively.
Some limitations must be taken into account in
the interpretation of results from this study. First,
bias due to survey nonresponse and missing values
for some variables cannot be ruled out. However,
previous studies based on data from National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys have
shown little bias due to survey nonresponse.36
Second, as a cross-section study, directionality of
the associations cannot be clearly established.
Third, several well-known hypertension risk fac-

tors were not examined. These unmeasured risk
factors may have significant implications on
magnitude of the observed association between
abdominal obesity and prehypertension in the
different ethnic groups. Fourth, our analysis was
based on one time blood pressure measurements,
compared to the recommendations of JNC 7, which
provides that blood pressure measurements be
based on the mean of two or more properly
measured seated readings on each of two or more
office visits.2 The implication of these differences
on the risk of prehypertension needs further
investigation.
Finally, as an observational study, caution must be
used regarding the interpretation of population and
relative attributable risks. For pedagogic reasons,
these concepts are used in this manuscript to imply
that the elimination of abdominal obesity would
lead to a measured decrease in prehypertension.
This assertion supposes that abdominal obesity
causes prehypertension. Unfortunately, the only
way to be sure that a cause­effect relationship exists
between abdominal obesity and prehypertension is
by system intervention to eliminate abdominal
obesity. In absence of such evidence, a cautious
interpretation of attributable risk is necessary. In this
manuscript, attributable risk was used to describe
the proportion of prehypertension explained by
abdominal obesity in a limited sense of statistical
association.
Conclusion
The result of this analysis discloses the independent
role of abdominal adiposity in prehypertension. We
have shown that a decrease in prehypertension
incidences is possible by developing public health
strategies designed to reduce abdominal obesity in
the ethnic groups that were examined. Among Black
and Hispanic women, we have also shown that a
reduction in risk of developing risk of prehyperten-
sion could be possible by instituting public health
measures to reduce rates of abdominal obesity even
to the levels seen in White women. Finally, inter-
vention programmes designed to reduce overall
obesity through life-style modifications including
exercise and diet may have public health conse-
quences in reducing the incidence of prehyperten-
sion in these populations. The positive association
between abdominal obesity and prehypertension in
these at-risk-populations provides a compelling
reason for initiating an early race/ethnic and
gender-specific public health obesity intervention
in the United States.
