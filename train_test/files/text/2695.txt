IMPORTANCE Violence is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among youth, with more
than 700 000 emergency department (ED) visits annually for assault-related injuries. The
risk for violent reinjury among high-risk, assault-injured youth is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE To compare recidivism for violent injury and mortality outcomes among
drug-using, assault-injured youth (AI group) and drug-using, non­assault-injured control
participants (non-AI group) presenting to an urban ED for care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants were enrolled in a prospective cohort study
from December 2, 2009, through September 30, 2011, at an urban level I ED and followed up
for 24 months. We administered validated measures of violence and substance use and
mental health diagnostic interviews and reviewed medical records at baseline and at each
point of follow-up (6, 12, 18, and 24 months).
EXPOSURE Follow-up over 24 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Use of ED services for assault or mortality measured from
medical record abstraction supplemented with self-report.
RESULTS We followed 349 AI and 250 non-AI youth for 24 months. Youth in the AI group had
almost twice the risk for a violent injury requiring ED care within 2 years compared with the
non-AI group (36.7% vs 22.4%; relative risk [RR], 1.65 [95% CI, 1.25-2.14]; P < .001). Two-year
mortality was 0.8%. Poisson regression modeling identified female sex (RR, 1.30 [95% CI,
1.02-1.65]), assault-related injury (RR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.19-2.04), diagnosis of a drug use
disorder (RR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.01-1.65]), and posttraumatic stress disorder (RR, 1.47 [95% CI,
1.09-1.97]) at the index visit as predictive of ED recidivism or death within 24 months.
Parametric survival models demonstrated that assault-related injury (P < .001), diagnosis of
posttraumatic stress disorder (P = .008), and diagnosis of a drug use disorder (P = .03)
significantly shortened the expected waiting time until the first ED return visit for violence or
death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Violent injury is a reoccurring disease, with one-third of our AI
group experiencing another violent injury requiring ED care within 2 years of the index visit,
almost twice the rate of a non-AI comparison group. Secondary violence prevention measures
addressing substance use and mental health needs are needed to decrease subsequent
morbidity and mortality due to violence in the first 6 months after an assault injury.

Youth violence is a leading cause of morbidity and mor-
tality. Homicide is the second leading cause of death
among youth overall and has been the leading cause of
deathamongAfricanAmericanmaleadolescentsandyoungmen
for more than a decade.1 In addition, nonfatal assault-related
injuries are responsible for more than 700 000 emergency de-
partment (ED) visits annually among youth (aged 10-24 years).1
Annual societal costs for fatal youth violence injuries are sub-
stantial,estimatedatmorethan$4billionforacutemedicalcare
and $32 billion for lost wages and productivity.2

Furthermore,althoughsubstanceusehasbeenoverwhelm-

using youth seeking care for assault-related injuries. Among
assault-injured youth treated in the ED, almost 55% have a his-
tory of recent substance use.12 The relationship between sub-
stance use and youth violence is explained by theories of clus-
tering of problem behaviors,16 pharmacological effects of drug
use,17 and the violent nature of the illicit drug trade.18
The purpose of this study was to examine 2-year outcomes
offatalandnonfatalviolentinjuriesamongasampleofassault-
injured, drug-using youth (AI group) (14-24 years of age) seek-
ing ED care compared with non­assault-injured, drug-using
youth (non-AI group) seeking ED care for other reasons. Based
on prior work and theory, we hypothesized that the AI group
wouldhavehigherratesofrepeatedviolentinjuryrequiringED
care compared with the non-AI group and that the probability
of reinjury would be associated with baseline characteristics of
substance use, mental illness, and carrying weapons.
Methods
Study Design
This prospective cohort study measured 2-year prevalence of
violent injury and mortality among a consecutively obtained
ED sample of assault-injured youth aged 14-24 years with a his-
tory of drug use in the past 6 months (AI group) compared with
a group of non­assault-injured, drug-using youth proportion-
ally sampled for age and sex (non-AI group). The study is part
of the larger Flint Youth Injury Study.12 The study was ap-
proved by the institutional review boards of the University of
Michigan and Hurley Medical Center, and a Certificate of Con-
fidentiality from the National Institutes of Health was ob-
tained. Written assent or informed consent was obtained from
participants or their parents if the participants were younger
than 18 years.
Setting
The study was conducted at an urban public ED in Flint, Michi-
gan, which is the only level I trauma center for the region. The
centerprovidescareforapproximately75 000adultand 25 000
pediatricpatients(youngerthan20years)annually(Flintpopu-
lation, 101 632). The rates of violent crime (2729/100 000) and
poverty (39.7% below the federal poverty level)19,20 in Flint are
comparable to those of other urban centers, such as Detroit,
Michigan; Camden, New Jersey; and Oakland, California. The
studysamplereflectsthelocalpopulation,whichis50%to60%
African American and is similar to those of prior studies con-
ducted among patients at this site.21
Population
Patients aged 14 to 24 years presenting to the ED for an assault-
related injury and a non-AI group proportionally balanced by
sex and age (ie, aged 14-17, 18-20, and 21-24 years) who self-
reported any drug use in the past 6 months (see the Measures
subsection) on a computerized screening survey12 were eli-
gible for inclusion in the longitudinal study. Patients were ex-
cluded if they presented for acute sexual assault, child mal-
treatment (ie, injury caused by an adult caregiver), suicidal
ideation/attempt, or conditions precluding ethical consent (eg,
altered mental status, psychosis). Recruitment occurred 7 days
per week, 21 h/d (5 AM to 2 AM) on Tuesday and Wednesday and
24h/dfromThursdaythroughMondayfromDecember2,2009,
throughSeptember30,2011.Assault-injuredpatientswhowere
medically unstable were recruited on the inpatient unit if they
stabilized within 72 hours.
Study Protocol
Assault-injured youth identified through electronic medical
records were approached by trained research assistants (RAs)
in waiting rooms or treatment spaces. Assaults were defined
as any injury intentionally caused by another person and were
assessed by the RA at the time of ED presentation. After pro-
viding assent or consent, patients self-administered a com-
puterized screening survey12 to assess their eligibility for the
longitudinal study, specifically drug use in the past 6 months
(see the Measures subsection). The non-AI group was en-
rolled systematically in parallel to the AI group to limit tem-
poral or seasonal variation and was proportionally balanced
by age and sex. For example, after identifying a 16-year old fe-
male with an acute assault-related injury and drug use in the
past 6 months on the screening survey, the RA would recruit
sequentially, by triage time, the next female aged 14 to 17 years

seeking ED care for a medical complaint or an unintentional
injury; those with screen findings that were positive for any
drug use in the past 6 months would be recruited for the lon-
gitudinal study. All screening and baseline surveys were ad-
ministered privately; family or friends accompanying the pa-
tient were not allowed to observe or participate during
administration.
Baseline and Follow-up Assessments
Eligible youth subsequently completed a baseline assess-
ment approximately 90 minutes in duration in the ED, includ-
ing a self-administered survey and an RA-structured diagnos-
tic interview for which they received $20 in remuneration.15
In-person follow-up assessments similar to the baseline sur-
vey were conducted at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in the study
ED or at a community location (eg, library, restaurant, or their
homes).Participantswerereimbursed$35forthe6-month,$40
for the 12-month, $40 for the 18-month, and $50 for the 24-
month follow-ups.
Measures
Demographic data were collected using validated measures
(Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Studies and National Lon-
gitudinal Study of Adolescent Health).22,23 Use of substances,
including alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs (cocaine,
inhalants, street opioids, methamphetamine, and hallucino-
gens) were assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identifi-
cation Test24 and the National Institute on Drug Abuse­
Modified Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement
Screening Test.25,26 Binge drinking was defined as 5 or more
drinks on a single occasion. The RA-administered Mini Inter-
national Neuropsychiatric Interview (version 6.0; January 1,
2010) was used to assess drug use disorder (ie, abuse or
dependence).27 For analysis, substance use variables were di-
chotomized (yes or no).
Firearm carriage was measured by asking participants how
often in the past 6 months they carried a gun.28 Mental health
disorders reflecting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders (Fourth Edition) diagnostic criteria, including a
currentmajordepressiveepisode(inthepast2weeks)andpost-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (in the past month but ex-
cluding the index assault), were assessed using the RA-
administered Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
andtheversionforchildrenandadolescents.27 Legalstatuswas
measured using a yes/no item (ie, on probation/parole) from
the Addiction Severity Index.29
ED Baseline Visit and Recidivism
Datafromreviewofthemedicalrecordsfortheindexvisitwere
abstracted from the ED medical record for all participants, in-
cluding visit type (assault-related and non­assault related in-
jury or medical) and disposition (admission or discharge) using
a standardized abstraction form. The RAs categorized all as-
saults using standard E-code designations30 and calculated In-
jury Severity Scores from the medical record data. Medical rec-
ords were audited with an error rate of less than 5%.
Assault-related reinjury for which the participant sought
ED care was examined as a composite measure that captured
medicalrecorddataonEDvisitsatthestudyhealthsystemdur-
ing the 24-month follow-up and self-report data from each of
the 6, 12, 18, and 24-month follow-up surveys (to capture vis-
its that may occur out of the study ED). Recidivism was mea-
sured by the question, "How many of your ER [ED] visits in
the past 6 months were related to injuries from a fight, as-
sault, or conflict with another person?"31 A prior study21 found
that 90% of this sample uses the study site hospital system ex-
clusively for routine medical care. Out-of-hospital mortality
was assessed through family members during attempted fol-
low-upcontact,localmedia,andregularreviewofnationaland
local public health mortality records.
Statistical Analysis
We used 2 and unpaired t tests to evaluate bivariate associa-
tions with the outcome of interest (ie, 24-month use of ED ser-
vices for assault-related reinjury). Kaplan-Meier (nonparamet-
ric) estimators of the survival function for the AI and non-AI
groups were plotted with confidence bands. We used Poisson
regression to estimate risk ratios for use of ED services for as-
sault within 24 months associated with baseline ED visit
characteristics.32 Independent variables were chosen based on
significance in the bivariate analysis (assault-related injury, di-
agnosis of PTSD or drug use disorder) and theory (race/
ethnicity, use of public assistance). Parametric survival mod-
els estimated the effect of assault-related injury, diagnosis of
PTSD, and diagnosis of a drug use disorder on the time until
the first ED return for assault or death. This approach allowed
interval-censored return times to be incorporated.
Results
Baseline Sample Characteristics
Overall, 599 youth were included in the sample (Figure 1), 349
intheAIand250inthenon-AIgroups.Participantsweremostly
male (58.8%) and African American (58.3%) and received pub-
lic assistance (73.0%). We found no significant difference be-
tween the AI and non-AI groups in terms of sex, age, race, and
receipt of public assistance (Table 1).15 Most participants (226
[64.8%]) sustained an assault from a blunt mechanism (ie,
struck by/against), firearm injury (70 [20.0%]; mean Injury Se-
verity Score, 7.2), or cut/pierced wounds (53 [15.2%]; mean In-
jury Severity Score, 2.2). Among the non-AI participants, 61
(24.4%) presented for an unintentional injury, with remain-
ing participants (189 [75.6%]) seeking acute medical care.
Follow-up Rates
The cohort was followed up for 24 months with completion
rates of 85.3%, 83.7%, 84.2%, and 85.3% at 6, 12, 18, and 24
months, respectively. We found no significant differences in
follow-up rates by group at any point.

the 24-month follow-up period compared with the non-AI
group (relative risk, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.25-2.14]; P < .001). Most of
the youth (76.1%) who returned for an assault-related injury
did so once, with a mean (SD) number of assault-related vis-
its of 1.4 (1.0). The AI group had a greater total number of re-
turn visits for assault (P < .001), and the proportion who re-
turnedmorethanoncewashigherintheAIgroup(9.5%vs4.4%
in the non-AI group) (P = .02).
Most of the visits after the index visit occurred in the first
6 months (Figure 2). Firearm assault was the injury mecha-
nism for 3.2% of the cohort with a post­index ED visit (mean
Injury Severity Score, 8.5) (13 youth in the AI group vs 6 youth
in the non-AI group). Of the subgroup of assault-injured youth
who initially presented with a firearm injury (n = 70), 4 (6%)
returned for a reinjury with a firearm. Overall mortality among
the 599 participants was 0.8% (n = 5), with 3 deaths due to vio-
lence, 1 due to substance use overdose, and 1 due to a motor
vehicle crash. Poisson regression (Table 2) modeling identi-
fied that an assault injury at the baseline visit, active PTSD
symptoms at baseline (in the past month), drug use disorder
(at baseline), and female sex predicted the use of ED services
for assault within 24 months.
Parametric Survival Models
In the parametric survival model, assault-related injury
(P < .001), diagnosis of PTSD (P = .008), and diagnosis of a drug
use disorder (P = .03) significantly shortened the time until the
first ED return visit for violence or until death (Figure 3). For
example, the model estimates that participants without a di-
agnosis of PTSD or a drug use disorder in the non-AI group
have an approximately 20% chance of returning to the ED
within 48 months, whereas participants in the AI group with-
out these diagnoses have a 40% chance of return visits. Fur-
ther, the chance of a return ED visit for participants in the AI
group with a diagnosis of PTSD and a drug use disorder was
greater than 60%.
Discussion
The research literature includes a substantial body of work
highlighting that youth violence is a complex but prevent-
able public health problem with a wide range of risk and pro-
tective factors that can be addressed with evidence-based vio-
lence prevention programs.33 These results indicate that youth
treated in the ED for assault-related injury are at high risk for
violent reinjury. Almost 37% of the AI group returned to the
EDwithin24monthsforaviolentinjury,mostwithin6months
oftheindexvisit.ThisriskisalmosttwicethatforanEDassault-
related visit observed among the non-AI group. The occur-
renceofreinjuryidentifiedinthissampleissignificantlyhigher
than that in prior samples.4,5,10 Although this study is, to our
knowledge, the first prospective study to evaluate such a
sample longitudinally from the ED with low attrition rates, our
reinjury rates were comparable to those seen among prior ret-
rospective samples of assault-injured youth from the mid-
1990s. Although promising trends in reduction of exposure to
violence have been shown in other arenas, this study sug-
gests that little progress has been made in the arena of recur-
rent violent injury.3,9
The results have important implications for the further de-
velopment and implementation of secondary violence pre-
vention programs. Physician leaders, health system manag-
ers,andinsurance/governmentpayersareincreasinglydefining

the standard of care for medical conditions to include a pre-
ventive care management plan that reduces recurrent costly
ED visits (eg, asthma action plans, management of diabetes
mellitus). Although such measures have been applied to
chronic diseases, which have an overall ED recidivism rate of
26% in a national network study,34 no comparable system of
standard medical care currently exists for youth presenting
with a violent injury. The monetary costs of these violent in-
juries are high, with 1 review estimating that acute care for fire-
arm assault injuries alone cost the US health system $630 mil-
lion in 2010, with 80% of this cost burden being carried by
public insurance payers (eg, Medicaid) or uninsured or self-
paying patients.35 Given that violence remains the leading
cause of death for urban youth in this age group, surpassing
cancer, asthma, and human immunodeficiency virus infec-
tion, it may need to be managed with a comprehensive ap-
proach that addresses the acute care wounds and the long-
termriskforreinjuryandneedforsubsequentED/hospitalcare.
These data also indicate that the initial 6 months after
their ED evaluation for assault injury is the time of highest
risk for a subsequent violent second injury requiring medical
care. Prior research finds the immediate post-ED period to be
a high-risk time for retaliatory violence,8 which is also a key
cause for youth fighting.36 The survival model demonstrates
that several modifiable and baseline conditions (PTSD, drug
use disorders) substantially affected outcomes of repeated
violence. Although the entire cohort had a history of drug
use (most commonly marijuana use and often occasional
use), a diagnosis of a drug use disorder at the index visit was
predictive of future assault in the multivariate model. This
finding reinforces the significant risk for recurrent injury
among drug-using youth and the need to include substance
use interventions within ongoing violence prevention pro-
grams. This study also confirms the importance of consider-
ing preexisting mental health needs while addressing vio-
lence prevention. Posttraumatic stress disorder was a
significant predictor of future assault in the multivariate
model, independently of acute reasons for the ED visit. Prior
research37 has suggested that PTSD symptoms may decrease
normal defensive cues and thus increase the risk for violent
victimization. Given that effective PTSD treatment exists,38
incorporating this treatment as a component of violence pre-
vention programs may be critical.
Race and receipt of public assistance were not predic-
tive of future use of ED services for assault. The high levels
of public assistance observed among the sample likely

reflect the high rates of poverty and unemployment seen in
this urban center, and the lack of variance of this variable
may account in part for the lack of significance of this mea-
sure of poverty. Furthermore, female participants consti-
tuted almost half of those who returned for an assault-
related visit within 2 years. This finding, combined with
recent data highlighting the increasing rates of violence
among young women,39 emphasizes the need to develop
violence interventions relevant to both sexes.
We note several limitations of this study. This study was
conducted at a single urban ED, potentially limiting general-
izability. In addition, although our sample reflected the racial
composition of the city where it was located, future studies
are needed among youth samples composed of a broader range
of races and ethnicities. Although a potential limitation, the
use of self-reported survey data has been shown previously
to have high reliability and validity among youth for self-
reported risk behaviors, including drug and alcohol use.40 Al-
though the AI and non-AI groups15 did not have significant dif-
ferences in use of medical services (primary care physician
visits in the past 6 months, routine physician examinations,
and ED visits in the past year for any reason) and typically pre-
sented for minor self-limited injury or medical complaints
(Figure 1), participants in both groups may have had or devel-
oped medical illnesses that would alter their probability of
being exposed to violence, which may have affected re-
peated ED visits for assault. Also, this study examined a co-
hort of drug-using youth, which limits our ability to general-
ize our findings to the 46% of assault-injured youth who do
not report drug use in the past 6 months.12 Finally, we at-
tempted to capture all potential ED visits for assault-related
injury during the follow-up period by combining objective re-
view of medical records with self-reported data (strength-
ened by an 85% follow-up rate); however, use of ED services
may be underreported.
Conclusions
Thiscohortstudyofassault-injuredyouthfindsthatmorethan
one-third of high-risk, assault-injured youth experience a re-
peated violent injury requiring ED care, with 0.8% mortality,
during a 2-year period. Future violence interventions for youth
sustaining assault-related injury may be most effective in the
first 6 months after injury, which is the period with the high-
est risk for recidivism. These interventions may be most help-
ful if they address substance use and PTSD to decrease future
morbidity and mortality.
