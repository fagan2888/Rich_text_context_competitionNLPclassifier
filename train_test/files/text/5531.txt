Introduction
About every second esophageal cancer is identi-
fied at an advanced, inoperable stage when the
therapeutic options are largely limited to the
oncological treatment and palliation of symp-

placement is the most common means of pallia-
tion of dysphagia caused by esophageal cancers,
and it could be effective for the palliation of
malignant tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEF).2
This minimally invasive endoscopic procedure
could rapidly improve the symptoms of patients,
but in 30­50% of the cases minor or major com-
plications occur with the return of dysphagia.3

plications substantially influences the efficacy of

Abstract
Background: Self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) implantation may rapidly improve
the symptoms of malignant esophageal stenosis and tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEF).
However, dysphagia often returns subsequently and repeated endoscopic intervention may
be necessary. The aims of the study were to identify the risk factors of complications, and
the frequency and efficacy of repeated endoscopic interventions; and to provide technical
recommendations on appropriate stent selection.
Methods: We analyzed retrospectively the clinical data of 212 patients with locally advanced
esophageal cancer who underwent SEMS implantation.
Results: A total of 238 SEMS implantations were performed with 99.06% technical success
and 1.26% procedure-related deaths in the enrolled 212 cases. Complications occurred in 84
patients (39.62%) and in 55 cases (25.94%) repeated endoscopic procedures were required.
Early reintervention 24­48 h after the stent implantations was necessary due to stent
migration (12 cases), arrhythmia (2 cases), intolerable retrosternal pain (1 case) and dyspnea
(1 case). An average of 1.98 repeated gastroscopies (range 1­6; median 2), 13.58 weeks (range
1.5­48; median 11) after the stent implantation were performed during the follow-up period:
37 stent repositions, 23 restent implantations, 15 endoscopic esophageal dilations and 7
stent removals. In 48 cases (87.3%) oral feeding of patients was made possible by endoscopic
interventions.
Conclusions: In a quarter of SEMS implantations, complications occur that can be successfully
managed by endoscopic interventions. Our experiences have shown that individualized stent
choice may substantially reduce the complications rate and make repeated endoscopic
interventions easier.

therapy. Endoscopic treatment is first recom-
mended due to its minimal invasiveness and low
burden to patients.4 In contrast to the high tech-
nical and functional success rate of the first stent
implantation, the endoscopic management of
SEMS complications represents a real challenge
even for experienced gastroenterologists.
The aims of our retrospective study were to eval-
uate the complications rate of SEMS implanta-
tions and to identify their predicting factors which
could help in the screening of high-risk patients.
We determined the frequency and efficacy of
repeated endoscopic interventions for the treat-
ment of SEMS complications. We provide tech-
nical recommendations on appropriate stent
selection based on the results of a correlation
analysis between the stent features and the type of
complications.
Patients, material and methods
A total of 212 patients with malignant esophageal
obstruction or TEF who underwent SEMS
implantation between 2007 and 2014 in one of
the Hungarian tertiary level referral gastroenter-
ology centers were retrospectively enrolled in our
study. The inclusion criteria were malignant
esophageal obstruction or TEF confirmed by
endoscopy or barium swallow/meal examination;
pathologically diagnosed esophageal malignancy;
unresectable tumor with advanced stage or poor
surgical candidates; onco team recommended
oncological treatment or palliative esophageal
SEMS implantation. The study was approved by
the Regional and Institutional Human Medical
Biological Research Ethics Committee of the
University of Szeged (ethics approval number:
3680 SZTE). Informed consent for this study was
waived by the ethics committee owing to the ret-
rospective nature of the investigation. The study
was carried out under the Declaration of Helsinki.
Stent implantations were performed under intra-
venous sedation (5­10 mg midazolam) with or
without intravenous analgesics (10­20 mg nal-
buphine). Various types of esophageal stents were
used from the following manufacturers: Leufen
Medical GmbH (Berlin, Germany); Boston
Scientific Corporation (Minneapolis, Minnesota,
USA); Taewoong Medical Co. Ltd, (Seoul,
South Korea); Changzhou Health Microport
Medical Device Co. Ltd (Changzhou, Jiangsu,
China); Endo-Technik (Solingen, Germany);
ENDO-FLEX GmbH (Voerde, Germany);
Accura Medizintechnik GmbH (Karben,
Germany); BVM Medical Ltd (Trinity Lane,
Leicestershire, UK); Micro-Tech Co. Ltd
(Nanjing, China). The diameter of the body of
the applied stents was 18 or 20 mm, and the stent
material and its coating were identical in products
made by the same manufacturers (polytetrafluor-
oethylene, silicone, polyurethane, etc.; nitinol,
steel, etc.). The pattern (weave, braided, knits,
etc.) and shape of stents varied widely depending
on the altered anatomical situations. The selec-
tion of the optimal stent depends on the disease
location and the length of obstruction. In the case
of tumors of the upper third of the esophagus and
the cardia, specific SEMS were inserted (cardia
umbrella stent, antireflux valve, antimigration
property, etc.) which could reduce the risk of for-
eign body sensation in the pharynx and the sever-
ity of gastroesophageal reflux. The choice between
partially and fully covered stents was individual-
ized, depending on the risk of restenosis and
migration: fully covered SEMS was preferred in
the case of a long and significant stenosis, in con-
trast to partially covered stents, which were
applied in cases with higher migration risk. The
stent was at least 2 cm longer than the endoscopi-
cally measured length of stenosis. The proximal
and distal ends of the neoplasia were marked with
external metal markers. If the stenosis was too
tight to allow the passage of the stent delivery sys-
tem and the endoscopic visualization of the distal
part of the esophagus, endoscopic balloon or bou-
gie dilation was performed first. After the removal
of the endoscope, the stent was inserted into the
right position with guidewire assistance under
X-ray control, and finally the proper SEMS posi-
tion was verified endoscopically (Figure 1).
Our study had three different aims: to evaluate
the success and complication rate of esophageal
stent implantation; to determine the frequency
and efficacy of repeated endoscopic interventions
related to SEMS complications; to propose
technical recommendations for optimized stent
selection based on the results of our study. The
efficacy of SEMS implantation was characterized
by technical and functional success rate. The
intervention was considered technically success-
ful if the stent was opened correctly in the proper
position confirmed by X-ray and endoscopy, and
functionally successful if the oral feeding of the
patients became possible 24 h after the interven-
tion. Minor complications were defined as mild
R Bor, A Fábián et al.

to moderate events related to stent implantation
which could be treated conservatively without
the need for hospitalization (gastroesophageal
reflux, emesis, retrosternal pain, mild dysphagia,
etc.). All patients received opiate pain killers
and in the case of distal obstruction prophylacti-
cally proton pump inhibitor therapy with or
without prokinetic drugs to avoid the reflux.
Major complications were defined as severe,
often life-threatening complications, which
required repeated hospitalization and endoscopic
interventions (TEF, stent migration or obstruc-
tion, aspiration pneumonia, arrhythmia, hemate-
mesis, etc.). We determined the rate, type,
frequency and efficacy of repeated endoscopic
examinations; furthermore, we analyzed the
characteristics of patients, the SEMS types and
the SEMS implantations to identify the risk fac-
tors and success of reinterventions.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
software version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Descriptive statistics were expressed as
mean and median with ranges. We used logistic
regression analysis, Fisher's exact test and 2 test
to identify the factors that can modify the risk of
SEMS complications.
Results
SEMS implantation
In the 212 enrolled cases, 238 SEMS implanta-
tions were performed due to malignant esopha-
geal obstructions caused by predominantly
primer esophageal tumors (83.49%) or lung can-
cers (13.68%). In 33 cases, TEF was present at
the time of SEMS implantation. The characteris-
tics of patients and stent implantations are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The technical
success rate of the first SEMS implantations was
99.06%. In two cases the cardia stent spontane-
ously migrated into the stomach immediately
after the implantation, and the reposition was not
feasible. In one case intolerable retrosternal pain
and severe dyspnea and in three cases develop-
ment of severe complications (arrhythmia, pneu-
monia) hampered the oral feeding of patients,
therefore the functional success rate decreased to
97.64%. Procedure-related death was 1.26%:
two patients died due to malignant supraven-
tricular arrhythmia and aspiration pneumonia
less than 24 h after stent implantation.
SEMS complications
In total, major and minor complications were
observed in 84 of 212 (39.6%) patients (Table 3).
Retrosternal pain (13.68%) and stent migration
(6.57%) were the most frequent early complica-
tions, and they appeared less than 4 weeks after

SEMS implantation. Fatal complications were
seen in three cases. One patient died 24 h after
stent implantation due to aspiration pneumonia,
respiratory insufficiency and septic shock. In two
cases malignant supraventricular tachycardia
occurred with cardiovascular instability immedi-
ately after stenting. These patients died despite
their admission to the intensive care unit and the
removal of the stent. After the 4-week follow up,
stent obstruction caused by tumor overgrowth or
ingrowth (15.09%), migration (10.38%) and new
TEF formation (7.08%) were the most common
complications. No correlation was found between
clinical/procedural factors (sex, age, tumor type,
location, necessity of dilation during stenting,
coverage of SEMS, and presence of TEF at the
time of stenting) and the development of compli-
cations (Table 4).
Repeated endoscopic interventions
In 55 cases (25.94%) repeated endoscopic inter-
ventions were performed, the indications of which
are shown in Figure 2. In 16 patients the first
reintervention was performed 24­48 h after stent
implantation; this was necessary due to early stent
migration (12 cases), supraventricular arrhythmia
(2 cases), dyspnea (1 case) and intolerable retros-
ternal pain (1 case). In this group, multiple endos-
copies were required in every second patient
during the follow up. In the case of patients with
an uncomplicated early postimplantation period
(24­48 h), 1.98 reinterventions (range 1­6;
median 2) were performed per patient at an aver-
age of 13.58 weeks (range 1.5­48; median 11)
after stenting. The type and frequency of endo-
scopic interventions are presented on Figure 3.
Stent reimplantation occurred in 23 cases: 21
patients received two, 1 patient had three and 1
patient had four SEMSs due to stent migration (7
cases), occlusion (10 cases) or new TEF forma-
tion (8 cases) (Figure 4). Endoscopic removal of
the stent due to complications (arrhythmia, ret-
rosternal pain, migration) was unavoidable in
seven cases. In 48 of 55 patients (87.27%) oral
feeding was resolved by an endoscopic procedure;
in six cases transient parenteral or permanent
enteral feeding with a gastric tube or percutane-
ous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was feasible.

No statistically significant correlation was found
between clinical/procedural factors (sex, age, tumor
type, location, necessity of dilation during stenting,
coverage and manufacturer of SEMS, and pres-
ence of TEF at the time of stenting) and the neces-
sity of repeated endoscopic interventions.
Discussion
This retrospective observational study of 212
patients has confirmed that stent implantation is
easy to perform, and a safe and effective treat-
ment in neoplastic esophageal obstruction and
malignant TEF. Additionally, our results revealed
that the majority of SEMS complications could
be successfully managed by endoscopic interven-
tions (stent reimplantation, dilation of stenosis,
stent reposition).
The role of SEMS placement in the palliative
treatment of malignant esophageal stenosis is
unquestionable because it provides immediate
and potentially long-lasting relief of obstructive
symptoms.5,6 SEMS placement is superior to the
remaining endoscopic procedures such as self-
expandable plastic stent (SEPS) placement, dila-
tion alone or argon plasma coagulation (APC),
because it provides a more durable asymptomatic
period and is associated with decreased risk of
complications.7­9 However, previous studies have
shown that the rate of SEMS-related adverse
events is high, and varies between 22% and 50%
depending on the location of the tumor, the pres-
ence of a fistula or tumor shelf, concomitant
chemoirradiation, tumor vascularity and the stent
design.7 Stenting of upper esophageal tumors
represents a real therapeutic challenge due to

repeated endoscopic interventions.

pain and globus sensation, an elevated risk of
TEF and aspiration pneumonia.10 In this location
the use of a specially designed stent is recom-
mended, the proximal end of which keeps a 2 cm
distance from the upper esophageal sphincter
after stenting. A retrospective study analyzed the
clinical data of 104 patients with malignant proxi-
mal esophageal stenosis and concluded that
SEMS placement is safe and effective, and the
complication rate is not elevated compared with
stenting in the distal esophagus.11 The use of
newly designed esophageal stents could reduce
certain types of complications such as SEMS with
antireflux valve or antimigration property, and
cardia umbrella stents.12 The results of previous
studies have shown better long-term efficacy in
the case of partially or fully covered stent place-
ment compared with uncovered stent place-
ment.7,13,14 The appropriate use of specially
designed stents could help to prevent the devel-
opment of short- and long-term adverse events.
In our study, fully covered SEMS were applied
most frequently (partially covered 16.39% versus
fully covered 83.11%), and in every cardia or
proximal esophageal tumor specially designed
stents were inserted. We have noted complica-
tions in 84 cases (39.62%) which showed no cor-
relation with tumor type, location, necessity of
dilation during stenting, coverage of SEMS and
the presence of TEF at the time of stenting. The
difference between the risk factors of complica-
tions in the published data and our study might
be caused by the retrospective study design or the
relatively small number of adverse events,
although it could also suggest that our stent
choice was adequate. We considered that the
stent design substantially influenced the effective-
ness and complications of SEMS placement,
therefore we always strived for individualized
stent choice. We experienced that:
- There is no difference between the migra-
tion rates of partially and fully covered
stents, but fully covered stents reduce the
risk of tumor ingrowth. In the case of
repeated endoscopic interventions, the
reposition of these stents is often easy even
months after stenting.
- There are differences between the coatings
of SEMS. Only chemically and mechanically
resistant coating could help to prevent tumor
ingrowth. The time for decomposition of
Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) coating is
longer compared with silicone and polyure-
thane coating, therefore the stent occlusion
by tumor ingrowth may occur later. In addi-
tion, the longer durability of SEMS coverage
allows the stent to be repositioned an
extended period after implantation, for
example in cases of stent occlusion due to
tumor overgrowth of the stent ends.
- Stents with a larger fitting surface at the
ends compress the esophagus less, thus the
risk of fistula formation at the stent ends is
lower.
- Flexible stents (based on our observations,
especially in the case of braided stent
design) do not stay straight, but also adapt
to the altered anatomy of the tumorous
esophagus. Therefore they increase the
internal stent patency and result in a
reduced and steady radial force throughout
the entire length of the stent. Therefore, the
use of SEMS with enhanced flexibility may
prevent damage to the esophagus wall by
the end of the stent (ulceration, TEF for-
mation) and decrease the intensity of
SEMS-related retrosternal pain.
- Bougie dilatation of esophageal stenosis
could be necessary before stent implantation
to allow the passage of the endoscope through
Figure 4. Indications of restent implantations (n = 23) and stent removal (n = 9).
R Bor, A Fábián et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 605
the malignant obstruction. Therefore, stents
should strive to achieve about 11­12 mm
diameter considering also the `rule of three'.
- In the case of significant esophageal steno-
sis requiring bougie or balloon dilatation,
smaller diameter stents could substantially
result in lower retrosternal pain without
elevated risk of stent migration.
- In the case of tumors of the upper third of
the esophagus and in the cardia, the use of
specially designed stents is essential.
- The chemically and mechanically resistant
stent retrieval loop may allow the move-
ment of the stent for a long time after
implantation.
These recommendations would decrease the bur-
den to patients and could also make the treatment
of stent complications more cost effective because
they may reduce the frequency of stent-related
complications, the number of repeated endo-
scopic interventions and the necessity of stent
reimplantation.
Endoscopic reinterventions can successfully treat
SEMS-related complications in most of cases.15
Homann et al. analyzed the clinical data of 133
patients with unresectable esophageal cancer.
They found that delayed complications occurred
in 53.4% (71 of 133 patients); these patients were
successfully treated by dilatation (24%), place-
ment of a second or third stent (27%), laser ther-
apy (16%), or placement of a feeding tube (19%).
Patients with repeated endoscopic interventions
had a significantly longer life expectancy (222 ±
26 days versus 86 ± 14 days, p < 0.001).16
Recurrent dysphagia occurred in one-third of
patients due to tumor over- or ingrowth via the
stent, noncancerous granulomatous tissue over-
growth or food impaction. In the case of stent
obstruction, either endoscopic reposition, APC,
exchange for a new stent or a second SEMS
implantation could be effective in restoring
esophageal patency.17 Incidence of stent migra-
tion ranges from 4% to 36%. This could be
asymptomatic or manifest, presenting as chest
pain, recurrent dysphagia or dyspnea. Stent repo-
sition or removal of the stent with a new stent
implantation are the effective endoscopic thera-
peutic options in these cases.18 In our study, in 48
of 55 patients (87.27%) with SEMS-related com-
plications oral feeding was solved by endoscopic
interventions (dilation, reposition, restent implan-
tation, stent removal). We confirm that the
second SEMS placement was effective in 91.31%
of cases; one of the 23 stents migrated distally and
one was removed due to retrosternal pain. Stent
reposition might be a good alternative to SEMS
reimplantation due to its effectiveness, low cost
and relative simplicity. We experienced that:
- In the case of fully covered or double-cov-
ered SEMSs the reposition or removal is
easy and well tolerated a few months after
stenting, despite partial tumor ingrowth.
- Stents can be displaced safely for centime-
ters and can also be positioned in spite of a
significant migration.
- Fixation of the proximal end of SEMS by
hemoclips may prevent repeated stent
migration.
- If repeated stent implantation is required
due to a fistula or tumor overgrowth at the
stent ends, we recommend distal dragging
of the first stent, above which a second
stent can be implanted.
- In the case of multiplex TEF with a thinned
out esophageal wall, simultaneous tracheal
and esophageal SEMS placement may be
effective.
In most cases, TEF develops next to the proximal
or distal end of the stent due to the radial force and
resulting pressure necrosis.17 The study performed
by Shin et al. highlighted that SEMS placement is
clinically successful in 80% of patients with TEF,
but during the follow up, recurrence of fistula was
experienced in one third of the cases.19 We have
found that the risk of fistula formation is high in
patients with TEF at the time of stenting (Figure
5). In 8 of 11 cases (72.73%) of new TEF forma-
tion endoscopic reposition or a second SEMS
placement solved the oral feeding of patients.
Retrosternal pain often occurs after stent implan-
tation, but it is mild to moderate in most cases,
and could be managed with opiate analgesics.
The frequency of this minor complication varies
widely among different studies from 13% to
60%.17,20 Our results correlate with the results of
other studies: 29 patients (13.68%) experienced
retrosternal pain, but only two of them required
endoscopic intervention, stent removal (6.89%).
In one quarter of patients we should expect the
development of complications. Despite the simplic-
ity and high success rate of SEMS implantation,
the treatment of SEMS-related complications
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(8)

represents the real clinical challenge. Our study has
not found any clinical factors which could help the
selection of high-risk patients. Nonetheless, we
consider that the individualized stent choice could
help to reduce the frequency of adverse events and
make repeated endoscopic interventions easier. We
recommend endoscopic interventions as the first-
line treatment for SEMS-related complications
because in most cases they make oral feeding pos-
sible. Our recommendations for stent selection
may decrease the burden to patients and could also
make the treatment of stent complications more
cost effective because they may reduce the fre-
quency of stent-related complications, the number
of repeated endoscopic interventions and the neces-
sity of stent reimplantation.
