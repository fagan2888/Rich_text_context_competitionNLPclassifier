Abstract
Objective: To determine whether haemoperfusion (HP) with continuous venovenous haemofil-
tration (CVVH) improves the survival of patients with acute paraquat poisoning, compared with
those treated using HP alone.
Methods: Medical records of patients with acute paraquat poisoning were analysed. Patients were
randomised to undergo HP or HP þ CVVH within 24 h of paraquat ingestion. Mortality rate,
survival duration and cause of death were recorded.
Results: There were no significant differences in mortality rate between the HP group (n ¼ 458)
and the HP þ CVVH group (n ¼ 226) (57.4% and 58.4%, respectively). The mean survival duration
was significantly longer in the HP þ CVVH group than the HP group (8.6 Æ 3.1 and 5.1 Æ 2.3 days,
respectively). Early circulatory collapse was a major cause of death in the HP group. The major
cause of death in the HP þ CVVH group was late respiratory failure.
Conclusion: Combined therapy with HP and CVVH can prevent early death and prolong survival
duration following acute paraquat poisoning, providing the opportunity for further treatment.

Introduction
Paraquat (1,10-dimethyl-4-40-bipyridinium
dichloride) is a widely used herbicide that
was introduced to agriculture in 1962, and is
responsible for thousands of accidental and
intentional deaths each year.1 Attempts to
modify the toxicity of paraquat have proven

ineffective, and the clinical outcome of poi-
soning is therefore determined by degree of
exposure.2­6
The primary mechanism of exposure is
ingestion, after which paraquat accumulates
primarily in the lungs, resulting in acute
pulmonary distress.7 The selective accumu-
lation of paraquat in alveolar cells induces
the production of large quantities of toxic
free radicals such as reactive oxygen species,
leading to lipid peroxidation of cell mem-
branes, exhaustion of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate and cell death.8,9
Paraquat also has severe effects on the
gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver and
heart,7,10 and death is usually due to mul-
tiple organ failure.1
Haemoperfusion (HP) is the first-line
treatment in patients with acute paraquat
poisoning. HP is most effective when
initiated within 2 h of paraquat injection
and 4 h of ingestion and administered con-
tinuously for 6­8 h.11,12 HP is of limited
value in cases of severe paraquat poisoning,
however.13,14 Repeated pulses of immuno-
suppression with methylprednisolone and
cyclophosphamide may lower mortality
rates,5 although a multicentre study found
that mortality rates remained high in spite of
large intercentre variations in treatment
(including HP, immunosuppression and
antioxidant treatment).4 Continuous renal
replacement therapy, such as continuous
venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH), is
used to treat patients with acute renal failure
and cardiovascular instability and is
believed to eliminate excess cytokines and
inhibit abnormal enzyme release.15 To the
best of our knowledge, there have been no
large-scale studies investigating the efficacy
of HP with CVVH in lowering the mortality
rate of paraquat poisoning.
The aim of this retrospective study was to
determine whether HP with CVVH
improves the survival of patients with
acute paraquat poisoning, compared with
those treated using HP alone.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study recruited patients
with acute paraquat poisoning admitted to
The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou
University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China
between August 2004 and February 2013.
Exclusion criteria were: (i) patient held
paraquat in their mouth, but did not swal-
low; (ii) time to arrival at emergency room
>24 h; (iii) refusal to participate; (iv) incom-
plete treatment. Paraquat poisoning was
classified via sodium dithionite test of urine
obtained on arrival at the emergency room:
dark blue, severe poisoning; blue to light
blue, mild-to-moderate poisoning; no blue
colour, negative.16 Acute kidney injury was
diagnosed according to the RIFLE classifi-
cation (class R, class I, or class F).17
The study was granted an exemption in
writing by the Ethics Review Board of the
First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou
University and the requirement for specific
informed consent was waived. Informed
consent regarding the risk of acute paraquat
poisoning and all treatment modalities was
obtained from all patients upon their initial
admission. All patient information was
securely protected and available only to the
investigators.
Treatment
On admission, vital signs were assessed and
routine lab tests (including complete blood
cell counts, liver and renal function, coagu-
lation function, arterial blood gas and rou-
tine urine analysis) were performed. All
patients received a unified therapeutic regi-
men including gastric lavage, fluid replace-
ment, antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin B
and L-glutathione) and immunosuppres-
sants (corticosteroids). To reduce the
extent of oxygen free radical-induced organ
injury, intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg
every 6 h for 3 days) and intravenous
Gao et al. 27
vitamin C (3 g/day for 5­7 days) were
administered to all patients.
Using the block randomization method,
patients were randomly assigned to undergo
HP or HP þ CVVH. HP comprised one or
two courses of 300 g charcoal HP therapy
for 6 h (Adsorba; Gambro, Sweden) using
an jugular dual-lumen catheter. CVVH was
performed immediately after HP using an
AK-10 blood pump with polyamide haemo-
filter (FH-55; Gambro, Stockholm,
Sweden), with blood flow rate 100­150 ml/
min and effluent filtration rate 1500­
2000 ml/h. Duration of CVVH, replacement
fluid and net ultrafiltration rates varied
according to clinical status. Bicarbonate-
based solutions were administered before
the haemofilter as replacement solutions,
and haemofilters were changed every
24­36 h to prevent decay in membrane
permeability and loss of ultrafiltration
capacity. Heparin infusion was continued
at 300­700 U/h to maintain activated partial
thromboplastin time at 50% greater than
normal.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD or n (%).
Between-group comparisons were made
using 2-test or Mann­Whitney test, as
appropriate. Statistical analyses were per-
formed with SPSSÕ version 16.0 (SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ.
P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study enrolled 1185 patients, of whom
501 did not meet the eligibility criteria and
were excluded. The final analysis included
684 patients (201 males/483 females; mean
age 38.4 Æ 12.4 years; age range 13­61
years). Figure 1 shows the flow of patients
through the study. The total time elapsed
from paraquat ingestion to hospital arrival
was 4 h in 536 (78.4%) patients and >4 h in
148 (21.6%). There were no significant
between-group differences in demographic
characteristics (Table 1).
Data regarding clinical characteristics of
patients, stratified according to treatment
group, are given in Table 1. There were no
significant between-group differences in
prognostic factors or mortality rate. The
time from paraquat ingestion to death was
significantly longer and significantly fewer
patients died within 4 days in the
HP þ CVVH group than the HP group
(P < 0.01 for each comparison; Table 1).
There was a significant between-group dif-
ference in cause of death, with circulatory
collapse the major cause of death in the HP
group and respiratory failure the major
cause of death in the HP-CVVH group
(P < 0.01; Table 1).
Discussion
Paraquat is a widely used herbicide that has
been used in China since 1960. The in-
hospital fatality rate of paraquat poisoning
is approximately 55%, with no significant
differences between survivors and non-sur-
vivors with respect to patient characteristics.
Death generally occurs 24­72 h after inges-
tion, with causes including acute respiratory
failure, acute renal failure, acute hepatic
failure and multiple organ dysfunction syn-
drome.1,18 The present study found that,
compared with HP alone, HP þ CVVH
increases survival time but does not improve
the mortality rate of patients with acute
paraquat poisoning.
Continuous venovenous haemofiltration
has been shown to stabilize the haemo-
dynamic status of patients with severe
sepsis and multiorgan failure, but the exact
mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects
remain unclear.19 It is possible that CVVH
may be effective in eliminating serum cyto-
kines and enzymes,19 and could therefore
benefit patients with acute paraquat

poisoning. Significantly more patients in the
HP-CVVH group than the HP group sur-
vived for longer than 4 days in the present
study, and many of these patients died from
respiratory failure. This suggests that
prophylactic CVVH after HP can reduce
the number of early deaths caused by multi-
organ failure but does not prevent late
pulmonary fibrosis. The extended survival
time afforded by CVVH may provide the
opportunity for further treatment.
Several small-scale studies have shown
that prophylactic CVVH after HP could
prolong survival time and prevent early
death caused by circulatory collapse, but
cannot provide a survival benefit in acute
paraquat poisoning.20,21 The present study
included a large cohort of patients who were
treated according to a uniform three-step
protocol: (i) Fuller's earth within 24 h
following paraquat ingestion to reduce
absorption in the gastrointestinal tract;
(ii) intensive extracorporeal elimination
therapy (HP and CVVH) if urine paraquat
test was positive; (iii) intensive antioxidant
therapy (N-acetylcysteine, glutathione,
vitamin C). HP is known to effectively
eliminate paraquat from the blood, in spite
of its limited effects on mortality.22,23 This
may be due to the fact that the ingested
quantity is commonly many times greater
than the lethal dose, and the long delay
between ingestion and presentation.
This study has several limitations, most
notably the absence of data regarding
plasma paraquat concentrations. Plasma
paraquat levels peak early in the course of
poisoning, then decrease rapidly during the

first 10 h after ingestion because of distribu-
tion to tissue. An error of 1­2 h in the
estimate of ingestion time can move a
patient from 30% to 70% on the survival
curve.24 In addition, plasma paraquat levels
cannot be checked easily and quickly in an
emergency situation. In addition, the present
study was retrospective and performed in a
single centre.
In conclusion, combined therapy with HP
and CVVH can prevent early death and
prolong survival duration following acute
paraquat poisoning, providing the oppor-
tunity for further treatment. CVVH had no
survival benefit over and above that pro-
vided by HP alone. Prophylactic CVVH can
prevent early death caused by multiorgan
failure, but cannot prevent late pulmonary
fibrosis.
