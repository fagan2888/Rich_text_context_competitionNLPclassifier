How Do Race And Sex Affect
The Earnings Of Primary Care
Physicians?
Being female is consistently associated with lower annual incomes
among primary care physicians; being a minority race is not.
by William B. Weeks, Tanner A. Wallace, and Amy E. Wallace
ABSTRACT: To explore the connection between primary care physicians' race and sex and
their annual incomes, we used restricted versions of Community Tracking Study Physician
Surveys administered in 1998­99, 2001­02, and 2004­05. Compared to white male pri-
mary care physicians, we inconsistently found lower yearly incomes for their black male
peers but consistently found significantly lower incomes for their female peers of any race,
after differences in work effort, physician characteristics, and practice characteristics were
adjusted for. Sex-based differences persisted over time. Our findings suggest that address-
ing the underlying causes of sex-based income differences should be a priority for health
professional organizations, particularly as more women enter the physician workforce.

Historically, women have earned less than men. In the United
States, the disparity appears to be narrowing: among full-time, year-
round workers, the female-to-male median annual earnings ratio im-
proved from 71.4 percent in 1995 to 76.9 percent in 2006, purportedly because
more women entered the workforce, fewer women received minimum wages, and
the real wages of men decreased.1 Blacks and Hispanics also have lower median
earnings than whites. However, while the black-to-white median annual earnings
ratio has remained relatively constant over the past decade (60.2 percent in 1995
versus 61.0 percent in 2006), the Hispanic-to-white ratio has improved from 61.5
percent to 72.1 percent. In the recent past, the Asian-to-white median annual earn-
ings ratio also has been increasing.
Whether income disparities among physicians are attributable to race or sex is

of interest for at least two reasons. First, blacks and women represent growing
proportions of medical students, residents, and practicing physicians.2 Second,
because black primary care physicians (PCPs) have been shown to be more likely
than nonminority PCPs to care for underserved, medically indigent, and sicker
populations, it stands to reason that their incomes might suffer as a result.3
Using American Medical Association (AMA) data, we previously explored the
relationship between sex, race, and PCPs' annual incomes in the 1990s.4 After ad-
justing for work effort, physician characteristics, and practice characteristics, we
found that white and black male physicians had similar annual incomes. However,
white female physicians' adjusted incomes were 9 percent lower than those of
their white male counterparts among family physicians, 18 percent lower among
pediatricians, and 19 percent lower among internists. Black female physicians' ad-
justed incomes were 22 percent lower among family physicians, 27 percent lower
among pediatricians, and 29 percent lower among internists.
However, those studies had several limitations. First, the number of respon-
dents was relatively small: to develop an adequate sample size, we needed to
merge ten years of data into a single data set. Second, the AMA's sampling method-
ology did not allow for the generation of national estimates. Finally, the AMA data
did not allow us to track individual physicians over time and thereby determine
whether the sex-based income gaps we saw were changing.
Conducted thrice over the past decade, the Community Tracking Study (CTS)
Physician Survey had many respondents, provided national estimate weights, and
tracked adequate numbers of physicians over time to allow for longitudinal analy-
ses. Therefore, for this study we used the CTS data to determine whether, after ad-
justing for important variables, we could uncover any race- or sex-based inequities
in incomes among PCPs, and whether any revealed inequities changed over time.
Study Data And Methods
n Data source. We obtained the restricted-use version of the CTS Physician
Survey that was administered in 1998­99, 2000­01, and 2004­05.5 These telephone
surveys collected information on physicians practicing in the contiguous United
States who provided direct patient care for at least twenty hours per week. The sur-
veys obtained data on physicians' personal and practice characteristics, and annual
income after expenses and number of weeks worked in 1997, 1999, and 2003, respec-
tively. The surveys excluded federal employees, physicians who had not completed
their medical training, and temporarily licensed international medical graduates
(IMGs).
n Sequential cross-sectional samples. We limited our analysis to physicians
who self-identified as PCPs in family practice, general internal medicine, or pediat-
rics. Subspecialists were excluded from the analysis. The restricted-use versions in-
cluded information on physicians' sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. We limited our
analysis to physicians who self-reported their race as Caucasian/white, African

American/black, or Asian or Pacific Islander. Whenever Hispanic ethnicity was re-
ported, we classified the physician as Hispanic, regardless of whether race was addi-
tionally reported. Finally, following methods that we have previously used to mini-
mize the effects of high- and low-outlier incomes, we limited our analysis to
physicians who reported incomes between the first and ninety-ninth percentiles of
the sample.6
n Longitudinal sample. The restricted-use versions of the CTS include a unique
physician identifier that allowed us to determine whether a respondent had partici-
pated in multiple surveys. We were therefore able to construct a sample of 510 fam-
ily practice physicians, 360 general internists, and 309 pediatricians who had partic-
ipated in all three surveys.7
n Independent variables that influence physicians' incomes. We collected
variables that we have previously found to be associated with physicians' incomes.
Work effort. The number of annual hours worked, calculated by multiplying the
number of hours reported working in the practice of medicine in the past week by
the number of weeks worked in the last year, is an important variable in analysis of
physicians' incomes.8
Providercharacteristics. To address our concern that sex might influence the age at
which a physician entered medical school, and therefore bias results, repeating
previously used methods, we incorporated into the analysis the number of years,
in categorical terms from 0­5 years through forty or more years, that respondents
reported having practiced medicine, instead of age.9 Because these factors have
been associated with differences in annual incomes among physicians, we in-
cluded practice ownership status, board certification status, and IMG status as
variables.10 Because we reasoned that PCPs' incomes might vary by training de-
gree, we also included in the analysis the type of degree held--either osteopathic
(DO) or allopathic (MD).
Practice characteristics. Because practicing in nonmetropolitan areas has been as-
sociated with lower physician incomes, we included whether physicians practiced
in nonmetropolitan areas.11 Further, because disproportionate service of the medi-
cally indigent and patients with relatively poor insurance has been hypothesized
to decrease physicians' incomes, we included the self-reported proportion of pa-
tients in a physician's practice who are insured by Medicare and Medicaid.12
n Analyses. Using the variables described above, we first performed a sequential
cross-sectional analysis to describe the physician and practice characteristics of
male and female white, black, Asian, and Hispanic physicians. To determine whether
race or sex was associated with physicians' incomes, we used a linear regression
model in which the log of physicians' annual incomes was the dependent variable
and race, sex, and the variables described above were independent variables. Finally,
for physicians who had completed surveys for all three years, we used a generalized
estimating equations (GEE) analysis to determine whether the incomes of particular
race/sex groups had changed over time.13

Study Results
n Cross-sectional analyses. For each specialty and race/sex combination, the
2003 unadjusted mean values of annual income, annual hours worked, and propor-
tion of Medicaid patients in the practice are presented as a proportion of that for
white male physicians in Exhibit 1. Across all three specialties examined, women
consistently had lower unadjusted annual incomes and worked fewer annual hours
than their white male counterparts. Among internists and pediatricians, a smaller
proportion of white male physicians' patients were enrolled in Medicaid; this rela-
tionship held among family practitioners as well, except for Hispanic physicians of
either sex.14
White male physicians consistently showed an upward trend in annual income
over time, although annual work hours remained stable (family practice) or de-
clined (internal medicine and pediatrics). The number of years in practice for
white male respondents increased over time, while the proportion who did not
have an ownership interest in their practices declined over time. Among white
male family physicians and pediatricians, board certification rates increased over
time. With the exception of black male internists, where incomes and board cer-
tification rates declined, and Asian family physicians, where non-ownership sta-
tus increased, similar trends were found among men in all specialties.

Unadjusted incomes for white female physicians were much lower and demon-
strated less of an upward trend over time than was seen among male physicians;
indeed, unadjusted incomes declined over time for black and Hispanic women.15
Compared to their male counterparts, female physicians worked fewer hours, had
not been practicing as long, and were less likely to have an ownership interest in
the practice. In virtually all cases, female physicians were more likely to be board
certified than their male race-specific counterparts, and in most cases, female phy-
sicians' practices served greater proportions of Medicaid patients.
After adjusting for differences in work effort, physician characteristics, and
practice characteristics, female family practice physicians had much lower in-
comes than their male counterparts; these differences were statistically signifi-
cant, except for Asian women in 1999 and black women in 2003 (Exhibit 2).
Among women, within race categories, there was no evidence of narrowing of the
relative income gap--indeed, the income gap for white female family physicians
increased somewhat over the time period examined. Among male family physi-
cians, only Asians had statistically lower adjusted incomes than their white coun-
terparts, and then only in 1999. In comparison to their white male counterparts,
relative incomes of men in all race/ethnicity groups increased during the time pe-
riod examined.
Among general internists (Exhibit 3) and pediatricians (Exhibit 4), female phy-
sicians of all ethnicities had statistically significantly lower adjusted incomes than

their white male counterparts. With the exception of white female internists,
across both specialties, the relative adjusted incomes of all female races/ethnicities
were lower in 2003 than in 1997. Among male internists, only blacks had statisti-
cally lower adjusted annual incomes than their white counterparts, and only in
1997 and 2003; we saw no apparent trends. Among male pediatricians, race/
ethnicity was never associated with incomes that were significantly lower than
those for whites. The R2 for the regression models that we used ranged from 20.1
percent for family practice in 1999 to 28.2 percent for pediatrics in 2003.
n Longitudinal analysis. For physicians surveyed in all three years, greater
work effort and board certification were associated with higher incomes, while hav-
ing a higher proportion of patients enrolled in Medicaid was associated with lower
incomes (Exhibit 5). A relatively flat inverted U-shaped lifetime earning curve was
evident, with incomes peaking after fifteen to nineteen years of practice. Within the
longitudinal sample, black male physicians and all female groups had significantly
lower adjusted incomes than white male physicians. Overall, there was an upward
trend of about 1 percent per year in adjusted incomes over time for all groups. How-
ever, with the exception of a downward trend in relative adjusted incomes of 0.3 per-
cent per year (p = 0.08) across time for women, we found no statistically different
narrowing or widening of income gaps between white male physicians and race, or
race/sex combinations.
Discussion
Using data from the three most recently completed CTS Physician Surveys, we
found that male physicians had higher unadjusted incomes and worked more
hours, but female physicians were more likely to care for Medicaid patients. After
adjusting for work effort, physician characteristics, and practice characteristics,
we found that across all specialties and virtually every year, female physicians
consistently had much lower incomes than white male physicians; among male
physicians, we found such disparities only for black internists. We found no evi-
dence that sex-based disparities that were present in 1997 had decreased by 2003.
For a subsample of physicians who participated in all three surveys, we found that
black male physicians had lower adjusted incomes than their white male peers,
and female physicians of all races/ethnicities had even lower relative incomes.
These disparities appeared not to be narrowing; indeed, we found a trend toward
a slight widening of the sex-income gap.
n Comparison with AMA survey. These results revealed slightly greater sex dis-
parities than those found when we used 1992­2001 data from the AMA's Socioeco-
nomic Monitoring System. Comparing white female physicians with their white
male counterparts, we found that female family physicians' adjusted incomes were 9
percent lower, internists' were 19 percent lower, and pediatricians' were 18 percent
lower.16 Using CTS data, we found that white female physicians' adjusted incomes
were about 20 percent lower than those of their white male peers across specialties.

Results from the two data sources were more similar when comparing the adjusted
incomes of black male and black female physicians with those of their white male
peers.
n Limitations. Our analysis has several limitations. First, the number of black
and Hispanic respondents was relatively small, particularly among women. Second,
our findings could be spurious, simply reflecting increased numbers of female and
black physicians during a time period of stagnating physician incomes. However, the
relative consistency of findings with those of other studies, and in both the sequen-
tial cross-sectional and longitudinal samples, makes us confident of our findings.
Third, we did not examine other variables that might influence physicians' incomes.
Although each of our regression models accounted for a minimum of 20 percent of
the variance in incomes, factors that were not incorporated into the analysis--such
as the proportion of time spent in direct patient care versus other activities--might
mitigate some of the differences we found. Finally, the longitudinal analysis covers
only seven years, which represents about one-fifth of a physician's working lifetime,
and physicians of all ages were included in the analysis; however, different results
might be observed if physicians were followed for a longer period.
n Trend lines. Despite these limitations, our results suggest that being female is
consistently associated with having lower annual incomes among PCPs, but race,
per se, is not. And although the sex-based differences that we found are similar to
those found among nonprofessionals, sex-based disparities in primary care medi-
cine do not appear to be narrowing as they are among nonprofessionals.17
It seems inconsistent that a profession that embraces equity as a
cornerstone of medical quality tolerates sex-based inequity in pay.18 Female
PCPs have achieved the same level of education, have made the same time com-
mitment to training, and have expended the same direct and opportunity costs re-
quired of such commitment as their male counterparts. Efforts to further elucidate
and address the underlying causes of sex-based income differences--such as life-
style choices or performance bonuses based on work hours--are warranted and
should be a priority for health professional organizations, particularly as more
women enter the physician workforce.
