Abstract
Introduction
Diabetes may affect one-third of US adults by 2050. Adopting a healthful diet and increasing physical activity are
effective in preventing type 2 diabetes and decreasing the severity of diabetes-related complications. Educating and
informing the public about health problems is a service provided by local health departments (LHDs). The objective of
this study was to examine how LHDs are using social media to educate and inform the public about diabetes.
Methods
In June 2012 we used NVivo 10 to collect all tweets ever posted from every LHD with a Twitter account and identified
tweets about diabetes. We used a 2010 National Association of County and City Health Officials survey to compare
characteristics of LHDs that tweeted about diabetes with those that did not. Content analysis was used to classify each
tweet topic.
Results
Of 217 LHDs with Twitter accounts, 126 had ever tweeted about diabetes, with 3 diabetes tweets being the median
since adopting Twitter. LHDs tweeting about diabetes were in jurisdictions with larger populations and had more staff
and higher spending than LHDs not tweeting about diabetes. They were significantly more likely to employ a public
information specialist and provide programs in diabetes-related areas. There was also a weak positive association
between jurisdiction diabetes rate and the percentage of all tweets that were about diabetes (r = .16; P = .049).
Conclusion
LHDs are beginning to use social media to educate and inform their constituents about diabetes. An understanding of
the reach and effectiveness of social media could enable public health practitioners to use them more effectively.
Introduction
The Essential Public Health Services framework, developed by the Core Public Health Functions Steering Committee
in 1994 (1), charges local health departments (LHDs) with ensuring that their communities receive 10 essential
services including vaccination, screening, and surveillance (2). Among these services is essential service number 3
(ES3): inform, educate, and empower people about health issues. Such communication with the public and other
stakeholders about healthy behaviors and health risks has also been a focus of the standards for LHD accreditation by
the Public Health Accreditation Board (3). At least 3 of the standards (3.1, 3.2, and 10.2) include communication with
the public about urgent and nonurgent public health issues. A 2004 study found that only 61.3% of LHDs were meeting
the model standard performance of ES3 (2). Web-based social media sites (social media), such as Facebook and
Twitter, have the potential to aid LHDs in improving the provision of ES3, meeting accreditation standards, and,
ultimately, improving public health.

Social media have the potential to reach large audiences; worldwide more than 845 million people use Facebook and
140 million are Twitter users (4). Each minute, 695,000 Facebook statuses are updated and 98,000 tweets are tweeted
(5). Social media reach large audiences, including underserved segments of the population; social media use is
associated with age but is independent of educational attainment, race/ethnicity, and health care access (6,7).
As of 2011, 65% of adult Internet users reported using social media (8), and many of these users reported seeking
health information online (9,10). By 2007, approximately 1,200 Facebook groups advocated cures for disease (11,12).
Of the adults who use social media, 23% have followed their friends' personal health experiences or updates, 17% have
used social media to remember or memorialize people with a specific health condition, and 15% have obtained health
information from social media websites (13). Public health social media campaigns have been successful in promoting
condom use (14), educating low-income parents and farm families about child safety and health (15,16), and increasing
the likelihood that new mothers will stay smoke-free (17).
Diabetes is a major public health problem projected to affect as much as one-third of US adults by 2050 (18). In 2007,
diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (18). Behavior changes, including adopting a
healthful diet and increasing physical activity, can delay or decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes and decrease the
severity of diabetes-related complications (6,19­21). Many people with diabetes seek health information online (6),
including through social media sources. Many diabetes-focused blogs (eg, Diabetes Mine, www.diabetesmine.com/)
and diabetes-focused social network sites (eg, TuDiabetes, www.tudiabetes.org/) attract thousands of people managing
this disease (22).
The widespread use of social media and the use of social media by people diagnosed with diabetes present an
opportunity for LHDs. The objective of this study was to examine how LHDs are using social media to educate and
inform the public about diabetes by determining 1) whether LHDs are tweeting about diabetes, 2) whether LHDs that
conduct diabetes-related programming are more likely to tweet about diabetes than LHDs that do not conduct diabetes
programs, 3) whether LHDs tweeting about diabetes are more likely to be in jurisdictions with higher diabetes rates
compared with LHDs not tweeting about diabetes, and 4) what information the LHDs that are tweeting about diabetes
are providing.
Methods
Data collection
We used a mixed-methods approach to determine whether and how LHDs use social media to disseminate information
about diabetes. Between December 2011 and July 2012, we identified all Twitter accounts for LHDs in the United
States through Web searches for each of the 2,565 LHDs included in the National Association of County and City
Health Officials (NACCHO) directory. We added information about whether or not an LHD had a Twitter account and
how many Twitter followers each account had to the most recent data set of the NACCHO National Profile of Local
Health Departments study (Profile study) conducted in 2010 (23). The Profile study includes information about the
jurisdiction population of each LHD in the United States and LHD staffing, organization, financing, and services
provided. From the Profile study data, we used measures of 1) jurisdiction population, or the number of people living
in the jurisdiction; 2) total number of full-time equivalent staff (FTE) working at the LHD; 3) total spending by the
LHD in the last year; 4) the LHD leader's highest level of education; and 5) whether the LHD was conducting services
related to diabetes, physical activity, nutrition, or chronic disease itself or contracting these services. To determine the
staffing and spending for each LHD, we divided the FTE and spending variables by the jurisdiction population for
measures of FTE and spending per capita.
We identified 217 LHDs that used Twitter. We used the NCapture function of NVivo 10 software (QSR International,
Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) to collect and import all tweets that the 217 LHDs had sent since adopting Twitter.
LHDs adopted Twitter between June 11, 2008, and February 20, 2012. We used a word query search with fuzzy
matching to identify all tweets about "diabetes." Fuzzy matching is a process by which the exact word (diabetes) and
other related words (eg, diabetic) are captured. We identified 126 LHD Twitter accounts as having tweeted 1 or more
tweets containing "diabetes" or a related term, for a total of 1,024 total tweets. The use of the fuzzy matching strategy
resulted in the inclusion of 48 tweets that were not about diabetes (eg, diapers or disputes); we obtained a final sample
size of 976 tweets from 126 LHDs that included the term diabetes or a diabetes-related term. We added the number of
total tweets and diabetes tweets per LHD to the Profile study data. We obtained county-level diabetes rates from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/) and added them to the data set for LHD
jurisdictions that comprised an entire single county.
Qualitative coding
Our initial examination showed that LHDs tend to tweet information about risks associated with diabetes, benefits of
prevention and management of diabetes associated with specific health behaviors (eg, eating healthfully), and
mobilizing information or cues to action that provided specific information about actions to take to prevent or manage
Page 2 of 10

diabetes. These 3 emergent themes loosely follow the key components of risks, benefits, and cues to action from the
Health Belief Model (HBM) (24), which describes individual and external characteristics associated with the likelihood
of a health behavior change. Broadly speaking, these 3 HBM components describe a person's likelihood of adopting a
healthy behavior as related to their perception that their health is at risk, the benefits they perceive to be associated
with a healthy behavior, and external cues promoting a healthy behavior. To examine whether health departments
focused on educating and informing about risks and benefits, or whether they primarily provide constituents with cues
to action, we coded each tweet for risks, benefits, and cues to action. Operational definitions adapted from the HBM
were developed before coding:
Risks tweets were information about the population at risk and risk levels, risk based on a person's
characteristics or behaviors, or specific consequences or risks and conditions associated with the disease.
1.
Benefits tweets included information about the positive effects to be expected as a result of prevention,
screening, or maintenance behaviors.
2.
Cues to action tweets were information promoting specific prevention, self-care, and management techniques
or promotion of disease awareness.
3.
Each tweet could be assigned as many of the 3 codes as applicable. To ensure a reliable coding system, 2 of the authors
(J.H. and N.M.) coded a random sample of 65 tweets (6.6%). Agreement between the 2 coders was 78% with a kappa
of .89, which is regarded as nearly perfect by Landis and Koch (25). Once reliability was established, the 2 coders each
coded a portion of the tweets independently.
Data analysis
For LHDs with Twitter accounts, we compared health department characteristics of those tweeting about diabetes with
those not tweeting about diabetes by using descriptive statistics,  , and the Mann­Whitney U test for independent
samples. We also used geographic information systems to examine the geographic distribution of health departments
tweeting about diabetes. Finally, we examined the frequencies of each type of tweet (risks, benefits, cues to action) to
identify any patterns related to the content of LHD diabetes tweets.
Results
Of the 2,565 LHDs, 217 (8.4%) had a Twitter account. LHDs using Twitter accounts were in jurisdictions with the
largest populations and had the most staff and highest spending (26). Twitter adopters were also more likely to have a
top executive with a doctorate and to employ a public health information officer than LHDs not using Twitter. On
average, health departments with Twitter accounts had tweeted 392.7 times (standard deviation, 644.5).
Of the 217 local health departments using Twitter, 126 (58.0%) were tweeting about diabetes. Figure 1 shows the
distribution of LHD jurisdictions that do and do not have Twitter accounts. The median number of diabetes tweets per
health department tweeting about diabetes was 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 6.0). For those LHDs tweeting about
diabetes, a median of 1.1% (IQR, 1.5) of their total tweets since opening a Twitter account were about diabetes. Local
health departments tweeting about diabetes had significantly more constituents and more resources (Table 1) than
those not tweeting about diabetes. Consistent with the larger number of constituents, the number of Twitter followers
was significantly higher (z [U], 3.8; P < .001) in jurisdictions tweeting about diabetes (median, 177.0; IQR, 526)
compared with those not tweeting about diabetes (median, 59.5; IQR, 210). Top executives of LHDs tweeting about
diabetes were more likely to have graduate degrees than top executives of LHDs not tweeting about diabetes, although
this difference was not significant. Finally, LHDs tweeting about diabetes were significantly more likely to employ a
public information specialist (Table 2).

diabetes as of June 2012. [A text description of this figure is also available.]
A higher percentage of LHDs tweeting about diabetes either performed or contracted with others to perform diabetes
screening, chronic disease programs, nutrition programs, or physical activity programs compared with those not
tweeting about diabetes (Table 2).
We found mixed support for the relationship between the diabetes rate in an LHD jurisdiction and tweeting about
diabetes. We found no significant difference in diabetes rates in jurisdictions where LHDs were tweeting about
diabetes compared with jurisdictions where they were not tweeting about diabetes (Table 1). However, the number of
people with diabetes was significantly higher in jurisdictions tweeting about diabetes than in those not tweeting about
diabetes.
To learn more about the relationship between tweeting about diabetes and the prevalence of diabetes, we examined
whether the amount of diabetes tweeting was associated with the amount of diabetes in the jurisdiction. We found no
significant correlation between the diabetes rate in a jurisdiction and the number of LHD tweets about diabetes (Figure
2). However, the percentage of tweets about diabetes was positively and significantly related to the jurisdiction
diabetes rate (r = .16; P = .049). So, in jurisdictions with higher diabetes rates, an LHD tweeting about diabetes was
using a larger proportion of its tweets to send out diabetes information; however, this relationship was weak.

Figure 2. Geographic distribution of diabetes rates in 2009 (27) and the number of tweets about diabetes tweeted as
of June 2012, from local health departments using Twitter. [A text description of this figure is also available.]
Most health departments tweeting about diabetes were tweeting about the risks associated with diabetes and specific
cues to action for constituents; fewer health departments were tweeting about the benefits of healthy behaviors to
prevent or mitigate diabetes. Specifically, of those LHDs tweeting about diabetes, information relating to diabetes risk
was tweeted 358 times total by 79 (63%) local health departments. Approximately one-third (n = 41) of LHDs tweeting
about diabetes tweeted about benefits of health behaviors for preventing and managing diabetes for a total of 82
benefit tweets. Finally, 112 (89%) of LHDs that were tweeting about diabetes, were tweeting cues to action, for a total of
699 cues to action tweets. Table 3 has examples of tweets in each of these categories.
Discussion
Our study identified few significant differences in characteristics of the jurisdictions of LHDs that used Twitter to
disseminate information about diabetes and those that did not. Although more than half of local health departments
with a Twitter account are tweeting about diabetes, jurisdictions with LHDs tweeting about diabetes did not have
significantly higher diabetes rates than those with LHDs that did not. The number of people with diabetes was
significantly higher in jurisdictions that tweeted about diabetes than in those that did not tweet about diabetes;
however, this difference is likely due to the larger populations in these jurisdictions. LHDs providing (or contracting)
programming around diabetes and related health areas were more likely to tweet about diabetes, indicating that LHDs
may be using social media in support of their active program areas. An examination of tweet content showed that most
health departments are providing information about diabetes risks, and nearly all are providing specific cues to action;
however only one-third of LHDs are providing information about the benefits of healthy behavior in preventing or
mitigating diabetes.
Evidence is limited and mixed on the value of media campaigns in prompting behavior changes to reduce diabetes risk
and complications (eg, adopting a healthful diet, increasing physical activity). However, comprehensive health
communication campaigns are among the recommended evidence-based strategies in the Guide to Community
Preventive Services (www.thecommunityguide.org/healthcommunication/campaigns.html), and using social media is
Page 5 of 10

1 of the channels recommended to supplement mass media in these campaigns. LHDs may consider using social media
as 1 of their strategies to reach people at risk for, or living with, diabetes.
People diagnosed with diabetes are actively seeking health information on the Web, specifically in interactive venues
such as social media forums (6,28,29). Until the widespread availability of social media, diabetes health information
available online was static (eg, lists on websites) and lacked interactivity and engagement (30). The interactive nature
of social media can provide ongoing support for people with diabetes faced with managing their disease on a daily basis
(6). As 1 blogger explains, "Because diabetes is every day. It's not a disease that you can manage by simply popping a
pill and seeing your doctor once or twice a year. This disease, as a whole, requires thought and care every day" (22). It
is, therefore, important to better understand how best to serve this population and mobilize LHDs to ensure the
provision of useful information and resources. Health departments have a unique opportunity to use social media to
provide this essential service, meeting several of the standards required for accreditation and, potentially, aiding in
improving public health in their jurisdiction and nationwide. Future research is needed to better understand how best
to use social media as a tool for dissemination of health information to constituents and as a way to engage people
living with and managing chronic disease.
This study is limited by cross-sectional data; with 98,000 tweets being sent each minute, social media are constantly
changing, and these changes are not captured in our study. In addition, the strategies used in this study cannot
determine the reach of Twitter accounts beyond the number of followers, so we do not know who the diabetes
information is reaching and whether those receiving the information are benefitting from it or spreading it to others
who might benefit. Additionally, multiple comparisons were made without an adjusted  between LHDs tweeting and
not tweeting about diabetes, increasing the likelihood of a type I error. Despite these limitations, this study is the first
of its kind to examine how LHDs are using social media to provide the essential service of educating and informing
constituents and to support their active program areas.
Just over half of LHDs with Twitter accounts are tweeting about diabetes; diabetes tweets tend to come from LHDs
serving larger populations and LHDs conducting or contracting diabetes-related programming. Most diabetes tweets
from LHDs are providing information about diabetes risk and cues to action for their constituents. LHDs have the
opportunity to provide constituents with locally relevant health information and with cues to action; as social media
use grows among LHDs and the public, more evidence is needed regarding effective uses of social media for public
health practice.
