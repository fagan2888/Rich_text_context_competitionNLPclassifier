Outpatient Visits for Infectious Diseases
in the United States, 1980 Through 1996
Gregory L. Armstrong, MD; Robert W. Pinner, MD
Background: Recent studies have documented in-
creases in infectious disease mortality and in the pro-
portion of hospitalizations attributable to infectious
diseases. To further evaluate trends in the burden of in-
fectious diseases in the United States, we analyzed data
from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from
1980 through 1996.
Objective: To examine the epidemiology of and re-
cent trends in outpatient visits for infectious diseases.
Methods: Data were from a national probability sample
of patient visits to office-based physicians. Diagnoses re-
ported by the surveyed physicians were coded to indi-
cate whether they were infectious or noninfectious. In-
fectious diseases were placed into 11 mutually exclusive
categories.
Results: During the course of the survey, infectious dis-
eases accounted for 19.0% of visits to physicians, or an
average of 129 million visits per year. The infectious dis-
ease visit rate was higher in females than in males (587
vs 461 per 1000 persons per year) and higher in non-
Hispanic whites than in non-Hispanic blacks or Hispan-
ics (538 vs 407 vs 485 per 1000 persons per year). The
visit rate for infectious diseases was greatest in 0- to 4-year-
olds. Upper respiratory tract infections accounted for the
largest proportion of visits (38.0% of infectious disease
visits), followed by otitis (15.1%) and lower respiratory
tract infections (14.1%). The age-adjusted visit rate for
infectious diseases increased from 462 visits per 1000 per-
sons (17.5% of all visits) in 1980 to 575 (20.2%) in 1990.
From 1990 to 1996, this rate declined to 483 per 1000
(18.1%).
Conclusions: Infectious diseases are responsible for a
substantial proportion of outpatient visits to physicians
in the United States. Upper respiratory tract infections
account for the largest proportion of these visits.

FOR MOST OF the 20th cen-
tury, industrialized soci-
eties have experienced a
steady decline in the bur-
den of infectious diseases.
However, experience in the last decade has
shown that this trend may have stopped.
Events such as the epidemic of human im-
munodeficiency virus, the resurgence of
tuberculosis, and outbreaks of newly rec-
ognized diseases such as cryptosporidi-
osis and hantavirus pulmonary syn-
drome have raised the public's awareness
of the threat of infectious diseases and have
spawned public health efforts to monitor
and control emerging and reemerging in-
fections.1-4
To examine trends in the overall bur-
den of infectious diseases in the United
States, we analyzed 3 national databases
maintained by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics (NCHS). The first
of these found that the death rate from in-
fectious diseases had increased 58%, from
41 to 65 deaths per 100 000, between 1980
and 1992.5 The second, a study of hospi-
tal discharge data, found that the hospi-
talization rate for infectious diseases had
declined between 1980 and 1994 but that
the rate of decline was less than half that
for all hospitalizations, resulting in an in-
crease of 27% in the proportion of hospi-
talizations for infectious diseases.6 Dur-
ing the same period, the fatality rate for
infectious disease hospitalizations had
doubled.
In this study, we analyzed a third da-
tabase, the National Ambulatory Medical
Care Survey (NAMCS), to better define the
burden of infectious diseases in the out-
patient medical setting and to evaluate
recent trends in ambulatory visits for in-
fectious disease.

RESULTS
VISITS TO PHYSICIANS
FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES
During the 11 survey years included in the study, there
were an estimated 677 million visits to physicians annu-
ally, or 2774 visits per 1000 persons per year. Infectious
diseases accounted for 19.0% of these visits, with an
average rate of 526 visits per 1000 persons per year.
When routine visits (visits for physical examinations or
for administrative purposes only) were removed from
the database, infectious diseases accounted for 21.2% of
all visits.
The overall rate of outpatient visits varied by age
group (Figure 1). This rate was lowest in the 5- to 24-
year age group and highest in the oldest 2 age groups. In
contrast, the infectious diseases visit rate was highest in
the youngest age group and decreased with age until the
65- to 84-year age group, after which the visit rate lev-
eled off. In general, the proportion of all visits attribut-
able to infectious diseases decreased with age. Infec-
tious diseases accounted for 45% of all visits in 0- to 4-year-
olds but only 15.9% of visits in all other age groups
combined.
Visit rates for all diagnoses and visit rates for
infectious diseases were higher for females than for
males (Table 2, and Figure 2). Compared with the
visit rate for males, that for females was 41% higher
overall and 27% higher for infectious diseases. For
infectious diseases, this difference resulted from dis-
parities in visit rates in the age groups between 5 and
84 years. There was no significant difference in infec-
tious disease visit rates between boys and girls aged 0
to 4 years or between men and women 85 years old
and older.
METHODS
DATA SOURCES
We analyzed data from the NAMCS from 1980 through
1996.7 The NAMCS is a national probability sample sur-
vey that has been conducted by the NCHS in each year be-
tween 1980 and 1996 except from 1982 to 1984 and 1986
to 1988.
The sampling frame of the survey includes physi-
cians in the American Medical Association and American
Osteopathic Association master files who are (1) office
based, (2) principally engaged in patient-care activities,
(3) not federally employed, and (4) not in the specialties
of anesthesiology, pathology, or radiology. Within this
frame, physicians are chosen according to a multistage
probability sampling design. Chosen physicians are then
asked to collect information on a random sample of
patient visits during the course of a randomly selected
week.8
For each visit, the physician or office assistant fills out
a 1-page form that includes questions about the patient's
demographic characteristics, the principal diagnosis made
at the visit, other diagnoses, tests ordered, and medica-
tions prescribed. Information on the forms is then entered
into the database by staff at the NCHS, and diagnoses are
coded according to the International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).9 Each visit is assigned a weight
equal to the reciprocal of its probability of selection to ob-
tain national estimates.
From 1980 through 1996, between 1354 and 2879 phy-
sicians participated in the survey (participation rate, 70%
to 74%). Approximately 33 000 to 46 000 visits were
sampled in each of the years except 1985, in which 71 954
visits were sampled.
Population data were obtained from the US Bureau of
Census. Intercensal or postcensal estimates of the civilian
noninstitutionalized population were used in all calcula-
tions of rates. The populations of Hawaii and Alaska were
removed from the 1980, 1981, and 1985 data, since these
states were not included in the surveys performed in those
years.
CLASSIFICATION OF ICD-9 CODES
We used a previously described protocol to classify ICD-9
codes according to whether they were infectious or non-
infectious.5 We restricted our analysis to those diagnoses
that are always or almost always caused by infectious agents.
Infectious diseases were grouped into 10 categories of re-
lated conditions (Table 1) that accounted for 94% of all
infectious disease visits. A category of "other infectious dis-
eases" was created for the remaining 6% of visits.
DATA ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed with SAS software (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC). Standard errors of point estimates of the num-
ber of visits were calculated according to algorithms pub-
lished in the documentation for the public use data tapes.8
Only principal diagnoses were considered in the analy-
ses. All visit records were weighted by using weights sup-
plied on the public use data tapes. Analyses used either (1)
the visit rate, expressed as the number of visits per 1000
persons per year, or (2) the visit proportion, expressed as
a percentage of all visits that year attributed to the particu-
lar diagnosis. Visit rates and visit proportions were com-
pared by means of t test or 1-way analysis of variance, as-
suming no covariance between the groups. When data from
several years were combined to give a single estimate, the
SE of this estimate was calculated according to algorithms
recommended by the NCHS (Iris M. Shimizu, PhD
[ims1@cdc.gov], e-mail, September 26, 1997).
Where indicated, rates were age adjusted to the 1990
censuswith1-yearagegroupsbymeansofthedirectmethod.10
Trends were analyzed by using weighted linear re-
gression with a segmented model. The model included
the year as the independent variable and the age-adjusted
number of visits in each year as the dependent variable. For
each year, the point estimate of number of visits was
weighted with the inverse of its variance. The model was
segmented, allowing the slope before a designated pivot
point to be different from that afterward. To decide where
to place this pivot point, the point was varied from 1981
to 1995 and the model was fit to the data. The model that
produced the lowest residual sum of squares was chosen.

Visit rates for all diagnoses and visit rates for infec-
tious diseases were higher in non-Hispanic whites than
in non-Hispanic blacks or Hispanics (Table 2, Figure 3).
The visit rates for non-Hispanic whites were 41% higher
overall and 32% higher for infectious diseases than rates
for non-Hispanic blacks. The visit rates among non-
Hispanic whites were 43% higher overall and 11% higher
for infectious diseases than rates for Hispanics.
TRENDS IN VISITS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES
The segmented linear regression model fit the data best
when the pivot point was placed at 1990. This model fit
the data better than the nonsegmented model (residual
sum of squares, 15.8 vs 38.5, P = .006 for the differ-
ence).
Between 1980 and 1990, the visit rate for infec-
tious diseases increased by 2.14% per year (P = .006,
Table 3 and Figure 4). This trend was seen in all age
groups and was statistically significant in all but 0- to
4-year-olds. Overall, the proportion of visits attribut-
able to infectious diseases increased from 17.5% to 20.2%
(P = .003 for trend). This increase in proportion of vis-
its attributable to infectious diseases was statistically sig-
nificant in all but the 2 oldest age groups, in which in-
creases in infectious disease visits were matched by
increases in visits for all reasons.
There was a significant decrease in visits for infec-
tious diseases from 1990 to 1996 (2.9% per year; P = .03;
Figure 4), and the proportion of all visits resulting from
infectious diseases decreased from 20.2% to 18.1%
(P = .02). This decrease was significant only in 25- to 44-
year-olds and 45- to 64-year-olds.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE CATEGORIES
The top 4 categories of infectious diseases--upper res-
piratory tract infections, otitis media and otitis externa,
lower respiratory tract infections, and skin infections--
accounted for 76.4% of all visits for infectious diseases
(Figure 5). Within these categories, as in most of the
categories, a small number of diagnoses accounted for
most of the visits (Table 4).
During the 1980s, significant increases in visit
rates were seen in the 3 largest categories of infectious
diseases (upper respiratory tract infections [P = .02],
otitis media and otitis externa [P = .001], and lower
respiratory tract infections and influenza [P = .008])
as well as in enteric infections (P = .02; Table 3).
Because visits for all 4 of these categories were increas-
ing faster than all visits, the proportion of visits attrib-
utable to diseases in these categories also increased
significantly.
Of the disease categories, only sexually transmit-
ted diseases declined during this period. The decline in
visit rate was not statistically significant, but, because over-
all visits were increasing during this time, there was a
significant decline in the proportion of visits attribut-
able to this category (P = .04).
During the 1990s, visit rates for 6 infectious dis-
ease categories decreased: otitis media and externa
(P = .02), skin infections (P = .02), urinary tract infec-
tions (P = .04), vaginitis and cervicitis (P = .001), sexu-
ally transmitted diseases (P = .001), and enteric infec-
tions (P = .008). Visits for diagnoses in these categories
also decreased as a proportion of all visits (P = .009, .03,
.06, .001, .001, and .01, respectively).

based physicians in the United States, or approximately
129 million visits each year. These measures provide con-
servative estimates of the impact of infectious diseases
on outpatient medicine, because they include only con-
ditions that are always or almost always caused by in-
fectious agents. Numerous conditions that are often a di-
rect result of infectious diseases, especially chronic and
neoplastic diseases such as hepatic cirrhosis and cervi-
cal cancer, were not examined.
Additionally, certain outpatient visits fall outside the
scope of NAMCS. Visits to emergency departments and to
hospital-based outpatient clinics are captured in a sepa-
ratesurvey,theNationalHospitalAmbulatoryMedicalCare
Survey, which began in 1992.11 Examination of the data
in the 1995 survey12 with the use of criteria from this study
shows that infectious diseases accounted for 21.5% of the
estimated96.5millionvisitstoemergencydepartmentsand
14.7% of the estimated 67.2 million visits to hospital-
based clinics. Government-sponsored health clinics, such
as sexually transmitted disease clinics, military clinics, and
prison clinics, fall outside the scope of both surveys.
Trends in visits for infectious diseases were not uni-
form during the course of our study. It is clear that visits
for infectious diseases increased slightly from 1980 un-
til the early 1990s and that infectious diseases consti-
tuted an increasing proportion of illness seen by outpa-
tient practitioners. But the magnitude of this increase was
small compared with that seen for the infectious disease
mortality rate5 or the proportion of hospitalizations for
infectious disease.6
Infectious disease visits have declined slightly since
1990. The reason for this decline and the increase that
preceded it is unclear. Infectious disease visit rates de-
pend not only on the incidence of disease but also on fac-
tors such as access to care, current diagnostic practices,
and the availability of over-the-counter medications.
Visits for certain categories of infectious diseases de-
clined during the study, most prominently for vaginitis
and cervicitis and for sexually transmitted diseases. The
decrease in vaginitis and cervicitis mostly reflects a de-
cline in unspecified vaginitis and candidal vaginitis, which
accounted for 82.8% of the visits in this category. The
decline in outpatient visits for this disorder may be a re-
sult of the availability since 1992 of over-the-counter treat-
ments for fungal vaginitis.13,14
The trends in visits for sexually transmitted dis-
eases are more complex and are similar to those docu-
mented by the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance
System.15 Visits for gonorrhea declined steadily during
the 16 years, a trend that has been attributed to improve-
ments in screening and treatment initiated in the 1970s.16
Visits for syphilis increased during the late 1980s and de-
clined in the 1990s, a trend that has been attributed by
some to the rise and fall in crack cocaine abuse and that,
according to national surveillance data, was most promi-
nent in minorities in Eastern cities and in the South.16,17,18

infectious diseases. However, 3 factors limit its useful-
ness in the surveillance of individual diseases. First, the
survey is not large enough to provide precise estimates
of visits for most specific diseases. Second, the diag-
noses used are clinical diagnoses given by the physician
at the time of the patient visit and often have not been
confirmed by laboratory tests. It is possible that many of
the visits attributed to infectious diseases in the survey
are actually the result of noninfectious conditions such
as allergies that are sometimes clinically indistinguish-
able from certain infectious diseases. Third, diagnoses
in the survey are not assigned according to uniform case
definitions.
Three indicators of overall burden of infectious dis-
eases increased during the 1980s: the mortality rate at-
tributable to infectious diseases,5 the proportion of hos-
pitalizations attributable to infectious diseases,6 and the
rate of ambulatory visits for infectious diseases. Many fac-
tors, such as the emergence of acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome, the reemergence of tuberculosis, and
the increase in antibiotic resistance, probably contrib-
uted to this increase. The trends in the 1990s have been
different. Ambulatory visits for infectious diseases have
declined, while infectious disease mortality may have
leveled off (G.L.A. and R.W.P., unpublished data, 1998).
Interpretation of these trends is complex, given the di-
verse, sometimes offsetting factors that influence them--
eg, the impact of protease inhibitors on improved
survival in persons with acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome, increased public health efforts to control
tuberculosis, and structural changes in health care
delivery that have resulted in trends toward fewer
hospitalizations and outpatient visits. It is clear, how-
ever, that many dynamic factors continue to promote
the emergence of infectious diseases and that trends in
the infectious disease burden will probably continue to
fluctuate.
