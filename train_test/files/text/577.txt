abstract OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence of weapons involved in the victimization of youth with
particular emphasis on weapons with a "high lethality risk" and how such exposure fits into
the broader victimization and life experiences of children and adolescents.
METHODS: Data were collected as part of the Second National Survey of Children's Exposure to
Violence, a nationally representative telephone survey of youth ages 2 to 17 years and
caregivers (N = 4114) conducted in 2011.
RESULTS: Estimates from the Second National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence indicate
that .17.5 million youth in the United States have been exposed to violence involving
a weapon in their lifetimes as witnesses or victims, or .1 in 4 children. More than 2 million
youth in the United States (1 in 33) have been directly assaulted in incidents where the high
lethality risk weapons of guns and knives were used. Differences were noted between
victimizations involving higher and lower lethality risk weapons as well as between any
weapon involvement versus none. Poly-victims, youth with 7 or more victimization types,
were particularly likely to experience victimization with any weapon, as well as victimization
with a highly lethal weapon compared with nonpoly-victims.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings add to the field's broadening conceptualization of youth victimization
highlighting the potentially highly consequential risk factor of weapon exposure as
a component of victimization experiences on the mental health of youth. Further work on
improving gun safety practices and taking steps to reduce children's exposure to weapon-
involved violence is warranted to reduce this problem.
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Firearms are
among the 10 leading causes of injury-related
death for youth and continues throughout the life
span. Annually youth homicides and assault-
related injuries result in an estimated $16
million in combined medical and work loss costs.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Findings add to the
field's broadening conceptualization of youth
victimization highlighting the potentially highly
consequential risk factor of firearm and other
weapon exposure as a component of
victimization experiences on the mental health of
youth.

Firearm violence is a prominent
public health concern with homicide
by firearm among the top 10 leading
causes of injury death for youth as
young as age 1 and continues
throughout the life span.1,2 Each year,
youth homicides and assault-related
injuries result in an estimated
$16 million in combined medical and
work loss costs. Despite its relevance
to public health, extant research on
youth firearm exposure has focused
on weapon carrying as the primary
focus of exposure.3­10 However, youth
are also exposed to firearms and
other weapons through direct
victimization and witnessing violence;
understanding how often and in what
ways this occurs is critical to the
field's broadening conceptualization
of youth victimization.
Previous research reveals that
cumulative exposures to
victimization and other adversities
lead to problematic developmental
outcomes. In our research, a key
concept that has emerged is that of
the "poly-victim," youth who suffer
a disproportionate quantity of
serious victimization and a much
greater array and intensity of
negative effects11­14 with a linear
relationship between the
accumulation of victimization types
and the level of adverse outcomes.15
Victimization involving a weapon
may make particularly salient or
traumatizing contributions to the
pattern; there is a need to better
understand how weapon
involvement may be linked to poly-
victimization.
Using data from a national sample of
youth, ages 2 to 17 in the United
States, we examine the prevalence of
weapons involved in the victimization
of youth with particular emphasis on
weapons with a "high lethality risk"
and how such exposure may
exacerbate the broader victimization
and life experiences of children and
adolescents. We use the term
"lethality" to separate out weapons
that have a higher likelihood of
lethality (ie, guns, knives) from those
with less likelihood of lethality (eg,
sticks).
METHODS
Participants
The Second National Survey of
Children's Exposure to Violence
(NatSCEV II) consists of a national
sample of 4503 children and youth
ages 1 month to 17 years of age in
2011. The current study focuses on
the subsample of youth ages 2 to
17 years (N = 4114).
Procedure
A short interview was conducted
over the telephone with an adult
caregiver to obtain family
demographic information. One child
was then randomly selected from all
eligible children living in
a household by selecting the child
with the most recent birthday. If the
selected child was 10 to 17 years
old, the main telephone interview
was conducted with the child. If the
selected child was younger than age
10, the interview was conducted
with the caregiver who "is most
familiar with the child's daily routine
and experiences." Interviewers
obtained verbal consent from the
caregiver for the child as well as
verbal assent from the child before
beginning the interview. A number of
steps were taken to make sure that
respondents' confidentiality was
maintained.
Respondents were paid $20 for their
participation. The interviews,
averaging 55 minutes in length, were
conducted in either English or
Spanish. The cooperation and
response rates averaged across
collection modalities were 60% and
40%, respectively. All procedures
were authorized by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of
New Hampshire. Further details
about aspects of the methodology are
available from the authors or detailed
elsewhere.16
Measurement
Demographics
Demographic information was
obtained in the initial caretaker
interview, including the child's
gender, age, race/ethnicity, and
socioeconomic status (SES). SES is
a composite based on the sum of the
standardized household income and
standardized parental education (for
the parent with the highest
education) scores, which was then
restandardized. Family structure,
defined by the composition of the
household, was categorized into 4
groups: children living with (a) 2
biological or adoptive parents, (b) 1
biological parent plus partner
(spouse or nonspouse), (c) single
biological parent, and (d) other
nonparent caregiver.
Victimization
Victimization was measured by using
the Juvenile Victimization
Questionnaire a comprehensive
inventory of childhood victimization
described in detail elsewhere.17
Children who had been exposed to
particularly large numbers of
different kinds of victimizations were
designated as poly-victims,
comprising the 10% of children who
had experienced the highest number
of victimizations. Past year poly-
victims were defined as having
experienced 7 or more types of
victimization in the past year.
Weapon Involvement
Using information from the Juvenile
Victimization Questionnaire follow-up
questions, victimization types were
further classified by whether the
incident involved a weapon (gun,
knife, stick, rock, bottle, tool, or other
item that could cause injury such as
a piece of broken glass, piece of metal
or brass knuckles).
Experience
Past year adversity due to nonviolent
traumatic events and chronic
stressors were measured by using 15
PEDIATRICS Volume 136, number 1, July 2015 11
items, 13 of which were taken from
a scale developed by Turner et al18,19
and 2 of which were constructed for
this study. Nonviolent traumatic
events included serious illnesses,
accidents, and parental
imprisonment, and chronic stressors
included substance abuse by family
members and homelessness. Mental
health status was measured through
the use of trauma symptom scores for
the anger, depression, and anxiety
scales of 2 closely related measures:
the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for
Children,20 which was used with the
10- to 17-year-old self-report
interviews, and the Trauma Symptom
Checklist for Young Children,21
used in the caregiver interviews for
the 2- to 9-year-olds.
Weaponized Environment
Exposure to gangs and peer weapon
carrying were measured by using 3 of
10 items from the Community
Disorder Questionnaire,22 which is
intended to capture signs of elevated
risk for crime and violence, such as
drug deals and obvious signs of gang
presence, or the aftereffects of crime,
such as arrests and police raids.
Respondents were asked if each
community disorder indicator had
happened in the past year. Exposure
to gangs was indicated if the
respondent indicated they had either
lived in a neighborhood where there
were gangs or ever seen graffiti in
their neighborhood that had gang
signs or warnings. Peer weapon
carrying was indicated if the
respondent responded positively to
the following question: "Have you
ever gone to a school where a kid
brought a gun or knife to school?"
Past year personal weapon carrying
was measured by using an adapted
item developed by Loeber and
Dishion.23
Incident-Level Characteristics
Information from other follow-up
questions was used to construct
variables that capture additional
incident characteristics. Specifically
we queried about: injury ("Were you
[your child] physically hurt when this
happened?" Hurt means you could
still feel pain in your body the next
day); location of the victimization
(coded as home [1 = yes, 0 = no] or
school [1, 0]); relationship to the
perpetrator (coded as juvenile peer
[1, 0], juvenile sibling [1, 0], or parent
[1, 0]); and impact: respondents were
asked whether they missed school
because of the incident or whether
they felt afraid (not at all/a little
afraid versus very afraid) when the
incident occurred.
Sample Weighting
NatSCEV II used a multiframe design
consisting of 4 overlapping frames:
a landline random digit dial frame,
a cell phone random digit dial frame,
an address-based sample frame, and
a list-assisted sample of prescreened
households known to have children.
To ensure that the estimates derived
from the combined frames were
representative of the target
population of children in the United
States aged 17 and younger, a 4-step
process, detailed elsewhere,16 was
used to construct the analysis
weights.
Data Analysis
Most analyses in this study were
conducted by using the child as the
unit of analysis and examine the
characteristics and associated
outcomes of children's victimization
experience based on (a) any weapon
versus none and (b) high lethality
(gun or knife) versus low lethality
(eg, sticks, rocks). Specifically, a series
of cross-tabulations were conducted
comparing youth demographic
characteristics (eg, gender, age) and
youth experience (eg, past year poly-
victim, high life adversity, trauma) by
report of any lifetime victimization
with a weapon with design-based
F statistics reported for dichotomous
and categorical variables and
unadjusted odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals for continuous
variables. Then, among all youth who
reported victimization with a weapon,
we conducted the same cross-
tabulations by whether the weapon
involved was low versus high
lethality risk.
We next examined the relationship
between victimization with a weapon
on mental health symptomatology;
we did this separately for younger
(ages 2­9) and older (ages 10­17)
youth given critical developmental
differences and the different
informants for the 2 age groups.
Specifically, we conducted a series of
6 linear regression analyses (3 mental
health outcomes 3 2 age groups);
standardized regression coefficients
are presented. The models take into
account poly-victim status and child
demographic characteristics.
To assess the impact of weapon
involvement on outcomes, an incident
level file was also created where
victimized children had separate
records for each reported incident of
lifetime victimization. Analyses
conducted on the incident level file
were adjusted for nonindependence
of incidents experienced by the same
child by calculating robust standard
errors. A series of cross-tabulations
compared various incident
characteristics (eg, location of
incident, relationship to perpetrator)
by (a) any weapon involvement or not
and (b) low versus high lethality risk
weapon involvement.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the Sample
Fifty-one percent of youth were boys
(Table 1). For approximately half of
the youth, data were collected by
proxy from a caregiver (28.5% ages
2­5, 23.5% ages 6­9). One-quarter
(24.1%) of respondents were ages
10 to 13 and the remaining were ages
14 to 17. One in 5 youth lived in low
SES households; 17.6% lived in high
SES households. Slightly more than
half (56.7%) of youth were white, non-
Latino; 18.8% were Latino (any race);
15.1% were black, non-Latino; and
12 MITCHELL et al
9.4% were of another non-Latino race.
Fifty-six percent of youth lived with
both biological parents.
Experiencing Victimization With
a Weapon: Lifetime Prevalence and
Youth Characteristics
More than 1 in 4 youth (26.5%)
reported at least 1 victimization that
involved a weapon in their lifetime,
such as a knife, gun, stick, or rock;
12.5% reported at least 1 direct
victimization with a weapon, and
13.1% at least 1 indirect (or
witnessed) victimization with
a weapon. Any victimization with
a weapon was more common among
boys (23.9%) than girls (18.4%),
increased with age, and was reported
more frequently by youth living in
low socioeconomic households, black
or Latino youth, as well as those who
lived in nontraditional families (eg,
other adult caregiver, parent, and
step-parent; Table 2).
In terms of youth experience, youth
reporting a weapon-involved
victimization were more likely to be
classified as a poly-victim in the past
year, experience high amounts of life
adversity in the past year, and high
trauma symptoms in the past month
(Table 2). They were also more likely
to be exposed to a "weaponized
environment": they reported more
past year gang exposure, peer
weapon carrying, and more personal
weapon carrying (for youth ages
10­17).
Victimization With a High Lethality
Risk Weapon: Lifetime Prevalence
and Youth Characteristics
3.1% of all youth reported
a victimization with a highly lethal
weapon (ie, gun or knife) in their
lifetimes; 0.9% reported at least 1
direct victimization, and 2.4% at least
1 indirect victimization with such
a weapon. Report of any victimization
involving a high lethality risk weapon
did not differ by gender but did
increase by age (Table 2). Compared
with all other youth, youth living in
nontraditional families were more
likely to report such victimization,
particularly those with some other
caregiver besides a parent (eg, other
relatives, foster parents). Poly-
victims, youth with high trauma
symptoms, those who had peers who
carried weapons, and who personally
carried a weapon were more likely
than all other youth to report
a victimization involving a high
lethality risk weapon.
Does Weapon-Involved Victimization
Intensify Harm Beyond Poly-Victim
Status?
Past year poly-victim status was
a significant contributor to mental
health symptomatology for all
symptoms except anxiety among the
younger children (Table 3). Reports
of any lifetime weapon-involved
victimization was significantly related
to all mental health symptoms over
and above the contribution of poly-
victimization. This was true for each
age group. All findings adjust for the
following youth demographic
characteristics: age, gender, race and
ethnicity, SES, and family structure.
Incident-Level Characteristics and
Outcomes
In Table 4, we report incident level
characteristics for all youth (analyses
were run separately for younger
[ages 2­9] and older [ages 10­17]
youth with similar findings--not
shown in Table): Weapon-involved
incidents were more likely to be part
of an indirect only victimization or
an incident that involved both direct
and indirect forms of victimization
(rather than direct only). Weapon-
involved victimizations were more
likely to be perpetrated by a peer,
and result in injury. A few differences
were noted when comparing low
versus high lethality weapon
involvement: More indirect only
weapon-involved victimizations
involved a high lethality weapon.
Fewer of the incidents perpetrated
by siblings involved guns or knives;
more of those victimizations
perpetrated by a caregiver involved
such weapons.
DISCUSSION
NatSCEV II estimates indicate that
.17.5 million youth in the United
States have been exposed to violence
involving a weapon in their lifetimes
as witnesses or direct victims, or .1
in 4 children. More than 2 million
youth in the United States have been
directly assaulted in incidents where
the high lethality risk weapons of
guns or knives were used. Weapons-
based violence is 1 of the largest
public health crises affecting
children in the United States, far
exceeding the numbers of children
with illnesses such as diabetes or
cancer. Despite its relevance to
public health, however, there is still
much we do not know about youth
weapon exposure and firearm
exposure in particular. For example,
firearm factors may play into the
victimization accumulation cycle in
various, yet undetermined, ways.
Negative firearm exposures, for
example, may make particularly
salient or traumatizing

contributions to the cycle. Firearm
fascination, acquisition, and carrying
may be a response among highly
exposed children and youth, which
may in turn aggravate the cycle.
Positive firearm experiences, on the
other hand, for some youth may
moderate or buffer the effects of
victimization exposure. Findings
from the current study suggest the
need for a more comprehensive
understanding of the range of
firearm exposures for youth and the
contexts that increase risk of harm
and victimization.

a The weapon follow-up question was asked about both direct victimizations (eg, assault), as well as indirect victimizations (eg, witnessing domestic violence). The weapon question was
asked only once per incident even when more than 1 victimization type was part of a single incident, and it was always asked about the first item reported for that incident. In the survey
order, direct victimization questions were asked before indirect ones. Thus, if an incident involved both direct and indirect victimization types, the weapon follow-up would refer to the
direct victimization involved. Only a very small proportion of incidents (3%) involved both direct and indirect victimization types. Among direct victimizations, assault questions with the
weapon follow-up mostly preceded nonassault ones for which the weapon question was not asked. However, it is possible that weapon use could be slightly understated in rare
combinations of victimization types. For example, if a nonassault victimization such as vandalism was the first 1 reported in an incident during which an assault also occurred, the
weapon victimization question would not have been asked about the assault victimization because it is not asked after the vandalism question.

Differences were noted between
victimizations involving higher
lethality risk weapons but also
whether any type of weapon was
involved (versus none). Indeed,
elevated rates of poly-victimization,
trauma symptoms, peer weapon
carrying, and personal weapon
carrying are noted with weapon-
involved victimization regardless
of the type of weapon. It could be
that the use or threat of a weapon
is such a startling and troubling
event that the specific type does
not matter as much. More
information is needed about the
contexts within which the
victimization occurs before we can
fully understand any nuances
associated with specific weapon
types at the incident level.
Although more weapon-involved
victimization, both generally and
those with high lethality risk are
indirect in nature, fear data reveal
that witnessing is often more
frightening to children24 and
previous analyses on poly-victims
reveal direct and indirect forms of
victimization carry the same
weight in terms of harm.25 Clearly
all types of victimization that
involve a weapon should not be
taken lightly, due to both their
enhanced risk for physical injury
and elevated trauma symptoms.
Even when a weapon is not used,
their mere presence greatly
increases the risk of injury and
threat and may exacerbate trauma
symptoms.
The classification of poly-victim
proved to be strongly associated
with the risk of weapon violence
exposure, providing further
indication of the need to do more to
identify those youth who
experience the greatest burden of
victimization; poly-victims were
particularly likely to experience
victimization with any weapon, as
well as victimization with a highly
lethal weapon compared with
nonpoly-victims. Further, weapon
involvement increases trauma over
and above poly-victimization.
Findings add to the field's
broadening conceptualization of
youth victimization highlighting the
potentially highly consequential
risk factor of weapon exposure as
a component of victimization
experiences on the mental health of
youth.
Beyond victimization, youth living in
what we are calling weaponized
environments are more likely to
report victimization with a weapon:
Youth exposed to gangs are twice as
likely as those who are not to report
weapon-involved victimization. Peer
weapon carrying was a salient factor
related to any weapon and high
lethality risk weapon-involved
victimizations. The same was true for
personal weapon carrying. Findings
suggest some direction for
promoting youth safety. Youth who
stay away from gangs and peers who
carry weapons are less likely to
experience a weapon-involved
victimization. Yet, at the individual
level, youth in some high-crime
communities may have difficulty
avoiding such individuals pointing to
the importance of a public health
approach to this problem and
looking for community-level and
policy solutions to reduce exposure
to weapons and highly weaponized
environments.
We recognize that some findings may
be influenced by unmeasured
dimensions, such as a greater
willingness among some
respondents to disclose personal
experiences. We take multiple steps
to reduce these issues through
survey design and through
interviewer training to make sure
youth are in a private, safe place
while answering questions. Concern
is also often expressed about the
degree to which caregivers know
about or are willing to disclose
victimizations concerning their
children, especially child
maltreatment. But comparison of the
caregiver and youth reports in
a similar survey using the same
measures did not suggest

CONCLUSIONS
These data indicate that children are
exposed to weapon-involved
victimization at disturbingly high
rates, affecting 1 in 4 children when
a full range of weapons is included.
In comparison with some other
serious concerns in our data, the
rates of exposure to weapon violence
is higher than the rates of suicidal
ideation, sexual victimization, and
caregiver maltreatment, for example.
Further, high lethality risk weapon
violence has a unique contribution to
current trauma symptoms over that
of poly-victim status, indicating that
it should be a focus of particular
concern. This is all the more
noteworthy because our past
research with this and 2 previous
national samples indicates that many
other victimization characteristics do
not make a unique contribution to
trauma symptoms above and beyond
the very large effect for poly-
victimization. Any child who is
known to have experienced
victimization should be screened for
exposure to weapon violence.
Further work on improving gun
safety practices and taking steps to
reduce children's exposure to
weapon-involved violence is
warranted to reduce this prevalent
problem.
