case research
The pricing efficiency of initial public offerings (IPOs) is documented to be posi-
tively influenced by some of the certification mechanisms. Such mechanisms
claim to reduce the information asymmetry between the issuers and investors.
The certifications that have a positive influence include investment banker reputa-
tion, group or venture capital affiliation, association with financial institutions and
analyst coverage, among others. The positive influence is claimed to be greater in
the emerging markets, where frictions due to information asymmetry are relatively
greater compared to the developed markets. It is in this context that the Indian
market regulator added a unique certification for IPOs in May 2007 by mandating
the grading of IPOs by an independent rating agency. It is expected to reduce the
information asymmetry by providing comprehensive issue-related information to
the market, especially to the retail investors in an `easy-to-use' format. While the
grades make no comments on the issue pricing, they are expected to reflect the
fundamental strength of the IPO.
The article empirically examines whether the introduction of grading has influenced
the demand and pricing efficiency of IPOs. The approach involves cross-sectional
regressions of the measures of underpricing and demand as dependent variables
with a set of dependent variables to represent various firm, issue and market
characteristics. The sample of graded IPOs used in the study has 182 issues during
the 6-year period between October 2005 and September 2011.
The study does not find any significant impact of grading on IPO pricing or demand.
Grading, which is expected to guide the retail investors, does not appear to influence
their demand. While the grades appear to have an impact on the demand of the
institutional investors, it has no influence on the IPO pricing efficiency. The graded
issues, which are expected to have lower information asymmetry, do not have a
relatively lower underpricing compared to the ungraded issues. Further, we find
that the differences in the grading do not significantly explain the cross-sectional
differences in market-adjusted underpricing. These results do not support any
incremental certification role of IPO grading, as reported earlier by some studies
with a smaller sample.

The Indian stock market regulator, the Securities
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), mandated
the grading of all initial public offerings (IPOs)
by a credit rating agency starting from May 1, 2007.1
Grading is a feature exclusive to IPOs in India.
According to SEBI, `The grade represents an assess-
ment of the fundamentals of that issue relative to the
other listed equities in India.'2 It is expected to provide
incremental, readily interpretable and independent
information about an IPO to investors and, thus, help
them better assess its investment potential.
The expected positive role of IPO grading appears
to be theoretically linked to two different strands of
evidence. First, it is well known that the IPO market
faces significant information asymmetry. Several IPO
underpricing models use information asymmetry as
the key explanatory factor (e.g., Benveniste & Spindt,
1989; Rock, 1986) with greater information asymmetry
leading to higher underpricing. Accordingly, firms
attempt to reduce underpricing through credible
signalling of their true quality. The employed signalling
mechanisms include (a) underwriter's reputation,
(b) the presence of venture capitalists in the pre-issue
funding, (c) group affiliation, (d) the quality of the
board of directors and (e) credit rating, among others.
These are found to have some degree of positive
impact on the pricing efficiency of IPOs. For instance,
association with venture capitalists (Barry, Muscarella,
Peavy & Vetsuypens, 1990; Megginson & Weiss, 1991)
and underwriter reputation (Carter & Manaster, 1990)
are found to reduce underpricing. Credit rating, a
certification mechanism very close to IPO grading, is
also reported to reduce underpricing in the US market
(An & Chan, 2008). Second, there is evidence that
individual investors often fail to objectively assess
IPOs, as they suffer from behavioural biases (e.g.,
Ljungqvist, Nanda & Singh, 2006). Grading could help
them to make a more objective judgement, as it claims
to compress the various issue-related information into
an `easy-to-use' symbol. These suggest that the impact
of grading on IPO bidding and pricing could largely
depend on the degree to which the rational investors
regard grades as a unique source of incremental price-
relevant information. If indeed, grading provides
unique, unbiased and more accurate issue information,
it could positively impact the demand for high-quality
IPOs and improve the pricing efficiency of IPOs.
The introduction of mandatory grading, however,
was not uniformly welcomed in the Indian market
on the following grounds. First, it was contended that
investors who are unable to understand and analyse the
issue information would also be unable to understand
the meaning of grades. A popular financial daily
wrote, `Indeed, assigning grades to new issues can lull
investors into a false sense of security about the risks
and rewards of equity investing and can make equity
look safer than it is' (The Economic Times, 2007). Second,
there were concerns whether the rating agencies would
have enough incentives to strive for objective grades.
While the reputation of a credit rating agency could be
verified with the actual defaults of debt securities, it
would be difficult to ascertain the truthfulness of IPO
grades due to the volatile nature of equity cash flows.
Third, the investment banking community maintained
that grading would increase the issue costs. Fourth,
analysts asserted that without a comment on the issue
price, IPO grading had very little relevance. On the
contrary, retail investors generally welcomed the idea
of IPO grading. They possibly felt that grading would
reduce their dependence on issue advertisements
and brokers. However, they demanded that the issue
pricing be also brought into the scope of grading.
The available evidence on the impact of IPO grading
presents conflicting evidence on its role. While Deb and
Marisetty (2010), one of the earliest studies on grading,
found that the IPOs after the introduction of grading
were associated with lower underpricing, Khurshed,
Paleari,Pande,andVismara(2011)foundnosuchrolefor
grading in underpricing. Further, Khurshed et al. (2011),
with a larger sample, found no support for the two key
findings of Deb and Marisetty (2010): (i) the high-grade
issues are associated with better IPO pricing and (ii)
retail investors respond to IPO grading with increased
subscription of the high-grade issues. Khurshed et
al. (2011), instead, argued that grading positively
influenced the subscription pattern of the institutional
investors, which, in turn, positively impacted the retail
subscription. This close link between the institutional
and retail investors' demands was attributed to the
evidence of retail investors following the institutional
investors' bids, which was possible due to the high
transparency of book building in India. However, the
submission of bids by the retail investors towards the
end of the bidding window significantly improves their
ability to assess the probability of receiving an allotment.
Such an assessment also helps them to reduce the
opportunity cost of funds underlying the application.
This behaviour would be more salient during the hot
IPO periods due to greater subscription levels and the
availability of more investment opportunities. These
134 MANDATORY IPO GRADING: DOES IT HELP PRICING EFFICIENCY?
motives of the retail investors imply that `the retail
demand following the institutional demand' cannot be
fully attributed to the information asymmetry faced by
the former. It is somewhat surprising that IPO grades
influence the demand of the relatively more informed
institutional investors rather than that of the individual
investors. If the institutional demand is influenced by
the IPO grade, then it is critical to examine whether
it necessarily improves the pricing efficiency in a
market like India, where institutions dominate price
discovery and the market demand. The results of Deb
and Marisetty (2010) may be partly attributed to their
relatively small sample of graded issues from a cold
market period, as they did not control for the market
conditions. Overall, the available research on the IPO
grading leaves a number of important questions not
adequately addressed. This article is a modest attempt to
resolve some of the contentious findings on the impact
of IPO grading, given its status as a unique certification.
The results suggest that grading has not significantly
impacted the pricing of IPOs in India. While
the institutional demand for IPOs seems to be
influenced by the IPO grades, it does not have any
significant impact on the retail demand, once the
possible influence of the demand of institutional
investors is accounted for. No significant change is
observed in the bidding approach of retail investors
after the introduction of grading. For institutions,
the low-grade IPOs appear to have weaker demand
and IPOs with high grades experience stronger
demand. These findings together tend to suggest that
the IPO grading as a certification mechanism has
not performed its expected role to a great extent. It is
perhaps difficult to assign reliable IPO grades due to
the volatile nature of the equity cash flows. Further,
the transparency of book building in India affords
retail bidders to learn from the real-time demand
schedule of the institutional investors. This could
also make IPO grading redundant for the retail
category demand. The failure of IPO grading needs
to be examined at a deeper level.
IPO GRADING
Important Features
IPO grades are assigned on a five-point scale. The
lowest grade (Grade 1) denotes poor issue fundamen-
tals and the highest grade (Grade 5) denotes strong
fundamentals, relative to that of the listed firms in India.
The grade is expected to only reflect the various issue
fundamentals such as the industry prospects, firm's
financial position, the quality of its management and
governance, risks and prospects of its new projects and
the firm's regulatory compliance. It does not take the
issue pricing into account and, thus, does not constitute
an assessment of the fairness of the IPO price.
The rating agency is expected to use the information
disclosed by the issuer and that obtained from other
sources. An issuer dissatisfied with the grade assigned
by one agency can approach another. However, the
issuer is bound to disclose all the assigned ratings.
The IPO grade along with the rationale given by the
agency has to be displayed in every advertisement
of the issue, including the issue prospectus and the
abridged prospectus. The rating rationale is expected
to detail the key findings and conclusions about the
various aspects considered in assigning the grade.3 The
red herring prospectus must carry the IPO grade. The
cost of the grading is borne by the issuer, which could
lead to conflicts of interest in IPO grading as reported
in credit rating (e.g., Smith &Walter, 2001).
TESTABLE HYPOTHESES AND METHODOLOGY
Testable Hypotheses
The nature of IPO grading suggests that it can be
regarded as an additional certification of the IPO
fundamentals. This approach had been adopted by
the earlier articles on this issue (Deb & Marisetty, 2010;
Khurshed et al., 2011). Based on the literature on infor-
mation asymmetry and the role of certification in IPO
pricing, we hypothesize the following impacts in the
IPO market with the introduction of grading.
First, if grading performs its expected role as a certifi-
cation, it is reasonable to expect that the more informed
institutional investors (qualified institutional buyers
[QIBs] hereafter) would be less reliant on the IPO
grades in their bidding compared to the retail investors,
as they have greater access to information and better
analytical skills. The retail investors, on the contrary,
are more likely to use the IPO grades. Hence, we expect
a varying level of influence of grading on the retail and
institutional demand.
Second, if the IPO grade provides incremental,
price-relevant information and summarises the bulky
public information into an easy-to-use form, it could
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2015 135
potentially improve the IPO pricing efficiency. This is
expected as the IPO grading could potentially improve
the information quality and reduce the informa-
tion asymmetry in the market. Both these outcomes
are claimed to reduce IPO underpricing over time.
Ljungqvist (2004) provided a detailed discussion on
these issues. Further, if the grading reduces information
asymmetry, then it could nudge the pricing of all IPOs
towards their respective fair price in a rational market,
and all issues, irrespective of their grades, should have
similar levels of risk-adjusted underpricing. This could
reduce the cross-sectional variation of underpricing
with the introduction of grading.
Third, by acting as a certification mechanism, if grading
helps to reduce underpricing, then its role would
possibly be more evident in the case of the relatively
small firms and firms belonging to relatively nascent
industries, as these firms are documented to suffer
from greater information asymmetry.
Methodology
The possible influence of IPO grading on the demand
for issues from various investor categories is examined
with cross-sectional regressions. The regressions take
the following form:
NTS X D
i i i i
= + + +
   
 .
GRADE
(1)
where N T S
i
is the number of times IPO i is subscribed
by an investor category (retail or QIB), and X
i
is a set
of variables to reflect the firm and issue characteristics,
and market conditions around the time of the issue (as
explained later in this section).
D
GRADE
represents a dummy variable to reflect the issue
grade. The economic and statistical significance of the
grade-related dummy would indicate the influence of
grade on the demand for IPOs.
The impact of grading on IPO pricing efficiency is
examined with the following cross-sectional regression
involving net underpricing as the dependent variable.
The independent variables reflect the key firm, issue
and market characteristics along with categorical varia-
bles to reflect the grades:

is the market-adjusted return on IPO of

(3)
The market return is proxied by the return on Sensex,
one of the most popular equity indices in India.
Primarily, the regressions examine whether the grade,
which is expected to convey the issue characteristics,
has any direct influence on the pricing efficiency.
The independent variables (X
i
) included in the above
regressions attempt to capture the ex-ante information
asymmetry surrounding an IPO, as the underpricing
and issue demand are believed to reflect the informa-
tion asymmetry. The issue and firm size are widely
believed to proxy for investors' ex-ante uncertainty. The
length of the history of a firm's operating performance
(age) is another proxy usually employed to capture the
degree of information asymmetry (for a discussion on
these proxies, refer to Ljungqvist, 2004). The extent of
ownership retained by the promoter is found to offer
some explanation for underpricing. As the informa-
tion asymmetry surrounding different industries could
significantly vary, the regressions also control for the
industry effects, as often employed in the empirical
analysis of IPO underpricing. The study also controls for
the clustering of IPOs, which is believed to significantly
influence the demand and underpricing of issues (e.g.,
Helwege & Liang, 2004). The definitions of the variables
employed in the regressions are summarised in Table 1.
DATA AND PRELIMINARY FINDINGS
Data
The IPO-related data are taken from the Prime database
and the firm-level financial data from the CMIE Prowess
database. The sample comprises all the 352 IPOs over
the 6-year period between October 2005 and September
2011. One of the IPOs is removed from the sample due
to the unavailability of its post-listing price. IPOs before
October 2005 are not included in the sample primarily
due to an important change in the book-building
process--replacement of discretionary allocation
with proportionate allocation on September 19, 2005.
Moreover, the Indian IPO market has significantly
evolved on many fronts, such as the institutional profile,
issue pricing, allocation, disclosures and listing norms,
etc., in the last decade. These changes would make
comparison of the IPO pricing efficiency or bidding
patterns over a long period of time unreliable in India.

Overall Characteristics of the Sample
A brief description of the sample IPOs is provided
in Table 2. The sample represents a total issue size of
about `136,250 crore, which averages about `19,464
crore per year and about `387 crore per issue. The
sample period corresponds to one of the most active
phases for IPOs in India and accounts for nearly 79
per cent of the issue volume and 84 per cent of the
issue value during the decade ending September 2011.
Most of the IPOs are offered through book-building
method (88 per cent). The median of the overall
subscription of IPOs is about 5 times and the mean
about 17 times. This suggests that there are many
highly subscribed issues. For instance, eight IPOs are
subscribed more than 100 times. The category-wise
subscription also has many extremes. The retail has
subscribed three IPOs more than 100 times and the
QIBs have crossed the `100 times' mark in as many
as 16 issues. The mean subscription levels peaked in
2007, which is also the peak IPO activity year. The
subscription level has significantly declined towards
2011. Among the investor categories, the demand of
the QIBs appears to be greater than that of the retail
for most of the years.
It appears that there is clustering of IPO activity in
India, as reported from other markets. The monthly
issue volume, issue size and its three-monthly moving
average over the period are given in Figure 1. The
maximum IPO volume (18 issues) is in February 2007
and the maximum issue amount is in October 2010
(` 17,674 crore).4

Note: The table gives the summary statistics of the sample of IPOs. Average listing time is the time between issue date and listing date.
Retail investors are those who bid up to `200,000 (`100,000 till October 2010) worth of shares. The two graded issues in 2006 are the IPOs
voluntarily graded by the issuers (grading was optional till April 30, 2007).
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2015 137
There are no IPOs in 7 months out of the 73 covered
by the data, and another 7 months have only one issue
each. The time periods between 2007 and 2008 and 2010
and 2011 appear to fit the description of a `hot phase' in
the Indian IPO market.
Given the apparent IPO clustering and the docu-
mented evidence of the conditions on issue pricing,
the study attempts to control for market conditions
in the regressions. Each month in our dataset is clas-
sified as a `cold' or a `hot' month, based on the 3
month centred moving average of the number of IPOs
during that month relative to the average number of
IPOs during the period. The moving average takes
care of any seasonality in the issue of IPOs. The top
one-third months are classified as hot months and the
remaining months as cold months. Out of the total
73 months, 18 months are classified as hot months.5
There is a greater demand for IPOs during the hot
period (median subscription about 10 times) rela-
tive to the cold period (median subscription about
3.5 times).
By the issue size, the IPOs appear to be concentrated
around two sectors: power, and `construction and real
estate'. These two industries together accounted for
about 47 per cent of the total issue size. By the number
of issues, `construction and real estate' was the domi-
nant industry, with about 16 per cent share of the IPOs.
The industry clustering suggests the need to control for
industry in the regressions.
Characteristics of the Graded IPOs
The final sample has 182 graded issues. The distribu-
tion of the IPO grades and a brief profile of the graded
issues are given in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. As
given in Table 3, only about one-fifth of the graded
IPOs have been assigned high grade (Grades 4 or 5)
and about 12 per cent are graded at the lowest level
(Grade 1). The lowest grade IPOs accounted for a
large share of the IPOs during the year 2007. By the
issue size, nearly 60 per cent of the IPOs are high
grade and only 1 per cent is in the lowest grade. This
skewness could possibly be due to a link between firm
size and grades. Overall, the distribution of the grades
suggests no significant bunching in the IPO grades.
It appears that the issuers, who are larger, relatively
low-levered and have a greater return on equity, tend
to receive the highest grading. This pattern could be
expected, as grading focuses solely on the fundamen-
tals of the firm.

138 MANDATORY IPO GRADING: DOES IT HELP PRICING EFFICIENCY?
As given in Table 4, the high-grade IPOs seem to attract
greater overall subscription. Across the entire sample,
the median QIB and retail demand appears to be greater
fo
r the high-grade IPOs. For instance, the median QIB
subscription of` `Grade 4' issues are about 20 times,
comparedto1.1timesofthe`Grade1'IPOs.Forlow-grade
IPOs, the retail demand seems to be greater than that
of the QIB demand. For instance, the median `Grade 2'
IPO is subscribed 3.3 times by the retail compared to 1.1
times by the QIB. Partly, the lower QIB subscription of
low grade IPOs could be due to the internal investment
restrictions on issuer features such as firm size, leverage,
profitability, etc. It appears that compared to the large
variation in institutional subscription across grades, the
retail subscription does not vary as much. These features
of the subscription pattern suggest, at least, that the IPO
demand of retail and QIB are not always similar.

Features of IPO Underpricing
A comparison of the pricing efficiency, as reflected in
the underpricing, is given in Table 5. All the issues
in the sample period are not underpriced. A sizeable
number (about 36 per cent) of the issues are found to
be overpriced, relative to their first-day closing price.
Nearly two-thirds of the overpriced IPOs are issued
in cold market conditions. IPO underpricing appears
to have significantly declined over the sample period.
The 2005 average first-day underpricing of 25 per cent
has declined to about 5 per cent in 2011. The apparent
improvement in the pricing efficiency could be attrib-
uted to a number of developments in the Indian market
such as a broadened investor base, improved informa-
tion disclosure by issuers, more effective aggregation
of issue-related information and improved regulation.
While there are many significant regulatory and struc-
tural changes in the market over this period, the higher
underpricing of the earlier years could also be due to
the greater time gap between the issue and listing and
the associated cost of tied-up funds. For instance, the
average time period between issue date and listing date
in 2005 is 26 days; the corresponding figure in 2011 is
only 18 days.
It appears that larger IPOs have more efficient pricing
in India. The average underpricing of IPO groups
varying in issue size and firm age is given in Table 5.
The top one-third of IPOs by size (issues of `150 crore
and above) have an average underpricing of about 13
per cent as against 32 per cent of the bottom one-third
(issues below `60 crore). The larger issues are
documented to have lower information asymmetry
world over. The age of the firm does not seem to have
any significant unconditional influence on the IPO
pricing efficiency. The underpricing appears to be
greater during the hot periods than the cold periods.
For example, IPOs experience average underpricing

Note: The two graded IPOs in 2006 were graded voluntarily by
the issuers, the remaining were graded under the mandate of the
regulator. The three firms given `Grade 5' were Coal India Ltd, the
largest public sector coal mining firm in India; MOIL, the largest public
sector Manganese ore producer and L&T Finance Holdings Ltd, the
finance arm of the largest engineering and construction firm in India.

of about 29 per cent during the hot months compared
to about 15 per cent during the cold months. This
pattern is similar to the finding from markets including
the United States (Helwege & Liang, 2004). Table 6
gives the average underpricing of IPOs grouped by
the overall and category-wise subscription levels.
IPOs that have attracted the top one-third overall
subscription (subscribed more than 14.24 times) have
significantly greater underpricing than the IPOs with
bottom one-third overall subscription (subscribed less
than 2.48 times). This relatively higher underpricing
of the IPOs with greater investor demand can be
understood as a hot market phenomenon having
greater investor sentiment.

Note: The bottom 1/3 IPOs by size correspond to issues below `60 crore, middle 1/3 correspond to issues between `60 and `150 crore and
top 1/3 are issues above `150 crore. By age, bottom 1/3 correspond to firms of less than 10 years age, middle 1/3 are firms of age between
10 and 15 years and top 1/3 are those with age of 15 years and above. The hot market indicates whether the issue month falls into the top
one-third months by the moving average of the number of issues (otherwise cold market). The underpricing figures are the average first-day
underpricing for each group in percentage. The difference in the yearly underpricing between the `top 1/3' and `bottom 1/3' by issue size is
statistically significant at 5 per cent level for the issue size except for 2005 and 2008. It is statistically significant for firm age at the 1 per cent
level, except in 2009, where it is significant at the 2 per cent level.

Note: The overall subscription groups are as follows: bottom 1/3 represent issues subscribed below 2.5 times; middle 1/3 are subscribed between
2.5 and 14.3 times and top 1/3 are issues subscribed 14.3 times and above. The retail subscription groups are as follows: bottom 1/3 are issues
subscribed below 2.5 times; middle 1/3 are subscribed between 2.5 and 8.7 times and top 1/3 are issues subscribed 8.7 times and above. The
QIB subscription groups are as follows: bottom 1/3 are issues subscribed below 1.7 times, Middle 1/3 are subscribed between 1.7 and 14.4
times and top 1/3 are issues subscribed 14.4 times and above. The underpricing figures are the average first-day underpricing for each group in
percentage. The difference in the yearly underpricing between the `top 1/3' and `bottom 1/3' is statistically significant at 10 per cent level for the
`overall subscription' (except in 2011, where it is significant at 12 per cent level), 1 per cent level for the retail category (except for 2008, where it is
significant at 5 per cent levels) and 1 per cent level for the institutional category (except 2008, where it is significant at 10 per cent levels).
The grade-wise average underpricing is given in
Table 7. The average underpricing seems to decline with
higher grading, except in the case of Grade 5. However,
the Grade 5 sample has only three IPOs, which makes
the finding less reliable. The median underpricing does
not show a declining trend with higher grading. Hence,
the averages are being influenced by large underpricing
values of a few IPOs.

Note: The two IPOs in 2006 were graded voluntarily by the issuers. The underpricing figures are the average first-day underpricing for each
group in percentage.
These univariate relations suggest that IPOs that are
larger or issued in cold markets have lower under-
pricing and grading has no conspicuous influence on
the underpricing.
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Grading and IPO Demand
We adopt a robust regression procedure to analyse the
influence of grading on IPO demand due to the presence
of many outliers in the subscription data. The results of
therobustregressionsinvolvingthedemand(Equation1)
of the retail and QIB investors are given in Table 8.
Panel A gives the results where the demand of the other
investor category is not included among the regressors
and Panel B gives the results where the demand of the
other investor category is included among the regres-
sors. The overall results suggest that both the institu-
tional and retail demand for IPOs is apparently influ-
enced by the grades. The coefficient of the grade dummy
for the low-grade IPOs (D(1), D(2) and D(3)) is negative
for both the retail and QIB demand. The significance of
the coefficients of grading is greater in the case of QIBs.

Note: The dependent variable in all the cross-sectional regressions is the number of times an issue is subscribed by an investor category (NTSi ),
measured as the ratio of the number of shares bid to the number of shares eligible for the category. All the 351 IPOs during the sample period
are included in the regressions. Panel A regressions do not have the demand of the other investor category among the regressors and Panel B
regressions include the demand of the other investor category as regressors. All the variables are as defined in Table 1. Coefficients significant
at 10 per cent or below are given in bold type.
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2015 141
For the QIB category, the results (given in Panel A of
Table 8) indicate that the demand is weaker for the rela-
tively low-grade IPOs, compared to the high-grade or
ungraded IPOs. The coefficient of the grade dummy is
positive for the high-grade IPOs. These results are intu-
itive as the institutional investors are believed to be
relatively more informed and rigorous in their invest-
ment approach, compared to their retail counterparts. It
is also likely that the institutional investors have invest-
ment policy constraints that restrict their investments
in IPOs having poor fundamentals. The other varia-
bles with significant impact on the IPO demand of this
category are the issue-related fundamentals: RONW,
group affiliation, issue size and market conditions. As
suggested by the coefficient of the `hot­cold' dummy
(D(hot)), the demand for IPOs is greater during the hot
period. These variables carry their expected signs.
On the contrary, the demand from the retail investors
(as given in Panel A of Table 8) for both the low- and
high-grade IPOs appears to be negative, relative to the
ungraded IPOs. The negative coefficient of the grade
dummy is significant only for `Grade 2' and `Grade 3'
IPOs.As the relatively low-grade IPOs have poor funda-
mentals and are risky, the appetite for such IPOs ought
to be lower, especially when these risk­return charac-
teristics are revealed to the market. The weaker demand
for the low-grade IPOs, compared to the ungraded IPOs,
tentatively suggests a guidance role for the IPO grade in
the case of the retail investors. While the coefficient of
the dummy representing the high-grade issues (D(4/5))
is insignificant for the retail category, its negative sign
merits some explanation. It is found that the high-
grade IPOs are larger issues by amount. For instance,
the average issue size of the overall sample is about
`388 crore and the average size of `Grade 4' and`Grade
5' issues is about `1,346 crore. These issues are over-
subscribed by the retail to a lower degree compared to
the average issue. This is possibly due to the limited
investible funds available with them. The institutional
investors have far more funds to invest, and hence may
invest more aggressively in the high-grade IPOs, as indi-
cated by the positive coefficient of the grade dummy in
that case. Generally, the very large issues are unlikely
to top the demand, when measured as the `number of
times subscribed'. Hence, employing the `number of
times subscribed' as a measure of the demand from
the investor categories itself is not without problems in
capturing the true relative issue demand.6
On the impact of the grade on IPO demand, Deb
and Marisetty (2010) had found that it was the retail
subscription that was influenced by the grades. This
study finds that the demands of both the retail and
institutional investors are influenced by the IPO
grades. The contrasting results could be due to the
difference in their approach. First, they did not control
for market conditions industry. Second, their sample
had only 48 graded issues and a large number of them
were issued during a relatively cold period. Third, it
could also be due to the influence of outliers in the
data. The robust regression employed in this study
takes care of the outliers.
In a related article, Khurshed et al. (2011) found that it
was the demand of the institutional investors that was
significantly influenced by the IPO grade. They found
that the institutional demand was relatively weaker
for the low-grade issues and stronger for the high-
grade issues. However, they did not find any signif-
icant role of IPO grading in the retail demand and
linked this insignificance of the grades to the claim
of the retail bids following the QIB bids, due to high
transparency of book building in India (Khurshed,
Pandey, & Singh, 2008).
Based on the evidence of the mutual influence of retail
and institutional demand, we modify the cross-sectional
demand regressions (given in Equation 1) by adding the
demand of the other category as a regressor. The results
of these regressions are given in Panel B of Table 8. The
demand of each of the investor categories apparently
influences the demand of the other, as indicated by the
significance of the associated coefficients (QIB-NTS and
retail-NTS). On inclusion of the demand of institutional
investors, the coefficients of the grade dummy turn
insignificant in the case of the retail demand.
Overall, these results tend to suggest that the IPO grade
has some degree of influence on the investor demand.
The impact appears to be stronger in the case of the
institutional investors. The direction of the impact for
both the categories suggests the following. First, the
low-grade issues experience weaker demand compared
to the ungraded issues. Second, the high-grade issues
experience greater demand from the QIBs compared to
the ungraded IPOs. It is apparently puzzling to see why
the grade leaves a greater impact on the demand of the
more informed institutional investors, rather than that
of the retail category. It is possible that the association
between grades and demand for the institutional
category found here could be just a reflection of the
independent IPO investment assessment done by the
institutions based on the issue fundamentals.
142 MANDATORY IPO GRADING: DOES IT HELP PRICING EFFICIENCY?
Grading and Bidding Behaviour
If grading had effectively supplemented or improved
the quality of issue-related information, available to
the retail investors, it would have allowed bidders to
take more informed IPO investment decisions. Such an
outcome could influence the bidding behaviour of the
investors, such as the (a) proportion of individual bids
at cut-off and (b) bidders' degree of distinction of IPOs
with bright future prospects from their poor counter-
parts. One would expect effective IPO grades to reduce
the number of bids submitted by the retail investors
without a price quote (bids at cut-off).7 If the IPO
grades perform their expected role, then it would also
enable the investors to better distinguish among issues
with differing future prospects. Our findings on these
aspects of the impact of IPO grading are as follows.
First, the proportion of individual investors bidding for
IPOs at cut-off price for the graded IPOs is apparently
no different from that for IPOs without grade. About
62 per cent of the individual investors' bids continue
to be at cut-off price.8 Second, the retail demand of
IPOs, with varying levels of post-listing returns, seems
to be by and large unchanged for the graded issues
compared to the ungraded ones. These findings about
the bidding behaviour suggest a less influential role of
grading in the IPO market.
Grading and IPO Underpricing
The possible impact of grading on underpricing is exam-
ined with cross-sectional regressions involving under-
pricing (as given in Equation 2). Two sets of regressions
are estimated: (i) with only a single dummy variable to
distinguish the graded issues from the ungraded ones
and (ii) with multiple dummy variables to distinguish
across the grades. The significance of the grade dummies
could imply the influence of grading on the IPO pricing.
The results of the regressions involving a single dummy
are given in Model 1 of Table 9. The results indicate that
whereas grading is expected to be negatively related to
underpricing, the related dummy variable is not signif-
icant (D (grade)). This seems to suggest that grading
has no significant influence on the pricing of IPOs. This
insignificance of grading has been reported earlier by
Khurshed et al. (2011). However, our results contrast
with that of Deb and Marisetty (2010) who had found
that IPO grading helped to significantly reduce under-
pricing in India. The differences might be due to the
larger sample employed in this study and for the
reasons identified earlier in the article.

Note: The dependent variable in all the cross-sectional regression
models is the net underpricing (UPi) as defined in Equation 3. `Model
1' is the regression involving all the IPOs during the sample period.
`Model 2' involves only graded IPOs and has dummies to capture the
IPO grades. All the variables are as defined in Table 1. Coefficients
significant at 10 per cent or below are given in bold type.
The results further suggest that the only significant
factors that influence underpricing are the issue size
(ln(Size)) and demand for IPOs (All-N T S). Larger
issues appear to achieve better pricing, as expected. This
could be attributed to its lower information asymmetry.
The market demand of IPOs, captured by the number
of times the IPOs are subscribed (All-N T S), suggests
that IPOs with greater market demand have higher
underpricing. This somewhat counter-intuitive result
can be understood as IPOs that experience high demand
during a hot period are often listed at a premium. This is
possiblyduetotheunmetdemandintheprimarymarket.
During hot markets, investors often exhibit a greater
inclination to own assets, irrespective of their price. The
greater underpricing of IPOs during hot markets is also
reported from elsewhere (Helwege & Liang, 2004).
The study further examined whether, among the
graded cohort, IPOs with higher grades have lower
underpricing compared to those with relatively lower-
grades. The results of the cross-sectional regressions
with the actual grades as categorical variables are
given in Model 2 of Table 9. The insignificance of all
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2015 143
the grade dummies (D(2), . . . , D(4/5)) reinforces the
earlier evidence on the failure of grading to positively
influence underpricing. As in the case of Model 1, the
most significant factor influencing underpricing is the
demand of IPOs.
It was expected that IPO grading would help to
alleviate the information asymmetry around the
IPOs. It is interesting, therefore, to examine whether
grading has any impact on the pricing of relatively
small IPOs, where the information asymmetry is
believed to be high. The study examined this issue
through cross-sectional regressions involving the
IPOs of only small firms similar to regressions in Table
9. All the firms that belong to the bottom one-third
when ranked by the pre-issue assets are taken as the
sample of small firms. We find no evidence for the
significance of grades on underpricing (results not
reported for brevity).
CONCLUSION
`IPO grading' attempts to give comprehensive issue-
related information in an `easy-to-use' format to the
investors. This was expected to positively influence
the IPO demand and improve the efficiency of IPO
pricing in India. We examine the extent to which
these expectations from IPO grading are realised in
the market.
While it appears that grading positively influences the
demand for high-grade IPOs, there is a significant diffi-
culty to regard it as an evidence in favour of the miti-
gation of information asymmetry by grading for the
following reasons. First, grading, which is expected
to guide the retail investors, does not appear to influ-
ence their demand. There is also no evidence that the
grading helps to better translate the issue information
into a price quote. Even with grading, the proportion
of retail bids without a price quote remains very high.
Second, while the grades appear to have an impact
on the demand of the institutional investors, it has no
influence on the IPO pricing efficiency. The extent of
underpricing is unrelated to grades. The graded issues,
which are expected to have lower information asym-
metry, do not have a relatively lower underpricing
compared to the ungraded issues. Further, the high-
grade issues do not have lower underpricing relative
to the low-grade issues. It is possible that the evidence
of the influence of grade on the demand of the institu-
tional investors could be just due to the independent
processing of the issue-related information by them
rather than the use of grades. For these reasons, it is
not appropriate to argue that the significance of IPO
grading in the institutional investor demand is suffi-
cient evidence for the contributory role of grading.
These results on the impact of IPO grading in India
on pricing efficiency sharply contrast with the finding
of Deb and Marisetty (2010) that the grading leads to
lower underpricing.
The insignificant role of grading in IPO pricing almost
suggests that grading has not performed its expected
role as a certification of the underlying issue quality.
The reasons for the failure of this innovative certifi-
cation could be many. It is perhaps difficult to assign
reliable IPO grades due to the residual nature of the
equity cash flows. Whereas credit rating is based on a
set of reasonably measurable criteria whose failure can
be tracked, the post-IPO stock performance has only a
weak tractability. This weak tractability may not suffi-
ciently incentivise agencies to assign grades objec-
tively and, thus, erodes its role as a credible signal of
IPO quality. Further, the transparency of book building
in India appears to allow prospective retail bidders to
benefit from the almost real-time demand schedule of
IPOs of the institutional investors. This could also make
IPO grading redundant.

3 Every grade report explicitly mentions that the grade is
not an opinion on the issue pricing.
4 The maximum issue size in October 2010 was contributed
by a large IPO of a public sector firm.
5 Cold months outnumber the hot months due to a large
number of months in the calendar period without any
issues.
6 For instance, the IPO of Coal India Ltd, a very popular
issue in India, with an issue size of about `15,200 crore was
subscribed only about 15.2 times compared to the sample
average of 18 times.
7 In India, the retail investors are allowed to bid at `cut-off
price', which leads to bidding for shares without quoting a
price. This is allowed on the assumption that many retail
investors might not have the wherewithal to quote a
price. If the IPO grading reduces information asymmetry,
for the retail investors, then more retail investors could be
able to form an opinion about the IPO price.

8 About 31 per cent of the total bids are submitted at cut-off.
Assuming a total individual investor quota of 50 per cent
and an almost equal level of subscription by individual
and institutional investors, this translates into 62 per cent
of individual bids.
