Tracking Health Care Costs:
What's New In 1998?
The much-feared upswing in costs still is not as imminent
as media reports suggest.
by Paul B. Ginsburg and Jon R. Gabel
At a time when the nation's leading
newspapers are proclaiming that
health care costs are rising again, this
review of trends in health care costs tells a
different story. The media report that insurers
are raising premiums to restore their profit
margins and that underlying costs are rising
as a result of growing use of expensive phar-
maceuticals and diminished abilities of health
plans to obtain discounts from providers.1 Al-
though there is truth to these observations,
the most recent systematic data on cost
trends--1998 private insurance premiums,
1997 provider revenues, and 1997 and 1998
payrolls in health services establishments--
show only a small upswing in the rate of in-
crease of costs. Perhaps a more substantial in-
crease is just around the corner, but recall that
in early 1997 the media were trumpeting that
health care costs were rising.2 The data de-
scribed in this paper show that their predic-
tions have not come to pass.
We begin with a discussion of trends in
the rate of growth of health care costs, which
are proxied by data on providers' revenues
and on payrolls in health services estab-
lishments. We then turn to premiums for
employment-based health insurance. Finally,
to gauge the impact of these trends on con-
sumers, we look at employees' share of health
insurance premiums and their out-of-pocket
spending for medical services and prescrip-
tion drugs.
RECENT DATA ON HEALTH CARE
SPENDING
Data on revenues reported by health care
providers show that the rate of increase in
health care expenditures rose modestly in
1997 (Exhibit 1).3 Our expanded version of the
Milliman and Robertson Health Cost Index
shows that after adjustment for general infla-
tion, revenues per capita increased 1.8 percent
in 1997, compared with 0.9 percent in 1996.
This rate of increase is less than the rate of
growth in real per capita gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP), which was 2.8 percent in 1997.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on
payroll costs in health services establishments
provide another vantage point on expenses in-
curred by health care providers.4 Although
payroll is only one component of provider
costs, it is an important one, and these data
are available with the shortest lag. Real pay-
roll per capita increased 3.6 percent in 1997,
compared with 2.4 percent in 1996. This in-
crease is comparable with that of provider
revenues. In nominal terms, payroll data for
the first five months of 1998 are similar to
those for 1997 (see Exhibit 3).5
Rates of growth in both provider revenues
and payrolls have declined sharply in the
1990s, reaching lows in 1994 and 1995. Al-
though growth rates have increased since
then, the increases have been modest, well be-
low those of the 1980s.

Among the major components of provider
revenues, the contrast between the high rates
of increase for drugs and the low rates for
hospital and physician spending is striking
(Exhibit 2).6 Increases in drug revenues have
been in double digits for three years now.
Most of this increase reflects growth in units
rather than in price. For example, in 1997 ex-
penditures increased 11.5 percent, while the
drug component of the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) increased only 2.5 percent.7 The trends
in revenues for hospitals and physicians are
similar to each other, but one should note that
hospital revenues consist of a decrease in reve-
nues for inpatient services (from declining
rates of admissions and lengths-of-stay) and a
relatively high rate of increase for outpatient
services (not shown).
Among the components of payroll costs,
the higher growth rate in 1997 than in 1996 is
accounted for entirely by more hours worked
(Exhibit 3). The increase in the average hourly
wage--3.2 percent--was the same as that for
1996. In contrast, increases in average hourly
wages in all industries rose to 3.8 percent. The
historical context is important. For many

years wage rates rose much more rapidly in
health care than in other industries, but that
disparity ended in 1994. Does the 1997 result
portend slower wage growth for health care
workers in relation to workers in other
industries?
Data for the first five months of 1998 do not
answer this question. They show roughly un-
changed rates of growth for hours but an in-
crease in the rate of growth of wages in health
services establishments--roughly in line with
the increase for workers in all industries.
INSURANCE PREMIUMS
In sharp contrast to anecdotes in the media,
premiums for employment-based health in-
surance actually increased only 3.3 percent in
1998 (Exhibit 4).8 Most predictions were for
increases in the 5­7 percent range. Although
the increase for 1998 is higher than the 2.1
percent increase in 1997, it continues to be
below the rate of growth of hourly earnings
(Exhibit 3). The premium increase was rela-
tively uniform among health plan types,
ranging from 2.9 percent for both health
maintenance organizations (HMOs) and
point-of-service (POS) plans to 3.8 percent for
preferred provider organizations (PPOs).
Some analysts have questioned whether
low premium increases could reflect changes
in plan mix or reduced benefits, but neither
explanation appears to be correct. The KPMG
Peat Marwick data that we use here are based
on responses to a question on the premium
change from the previous year for the most
popular plan of each type. So if one type of
plan had a higher level of premium than an-
other type, changes in mix would not affect
the data used here to describe trends. The
KPMG survey indicates that deductibles for
conventional and in-network PPO and POS
services today are lower than they were in
1994.9 Only 2 percent of employers reported a
decline in the overall level of covered benefits
from 1997 to 1998.
Exhibit 4 combines data on premium
trends with data on provider revenue for the
non-Medicare population. From 1992 through
1994 premium increases exceeded underlying
cost increases by a substantial margin, and
health plans were very profitable. However,
this reversed in 1995. In 1996 and 1997 pre-
mium increases lagged behind expenditure
increases, and profit margins in health plans
fell considerably. For 1998 analysts have been
expecting that premium trends will be above
trends in provider revenues.10 However, the
KPMG estimate of premium increases re-

ported here suggests that this may not turn
out to be the case. The 1998 increase in premi-
ums is no higher than the 1997 rate of increase
in the corresponding Milliman and Robertson
index.
This pattern traces an underwriting cycle.
When insurance is profitable, firms keep pre-
miums low to enter new markets and expand
market share in existing markets. However,
these activities tend to be cut back when prof-
its are down.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSUMERS
Consumers appear to be receiving substantial
benefits from the low rates of growth in costs.
This was not the case a few years ago, when at
the same time that growth rates of premiums
for employment-based insurance were drop-
ping rapidly, the proportion of the premium
paid by employees was rising (Exhibit 5).
This trend appears to have reversed (or at
least leveled off) in 1995 or 1996. Since then,
employee contributions to coverage have
grown more slowly than premiums. Indeed,
when we combine the data in Exhibits 4 and
5, we find that employee contributions have
been declining over the past three years. A
delayed reaction to the slowdown in premium
growth and tightening labor markets may
have been factors in ending the trend of re-
quiring employees to contribute a higher pro-
portion of the premium.
Consumers also have had very good news
on their out-of-pocket spending for medical
care. For example, data from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor's Consumer Expenditure Sur-
vey show that out-of-pocket spending for
medical services was 9 percent lower in 1995
than it was in 1990.11 Consumers' spending for
drugs increased only 11 percent--compared
with a 56 percent increase in drug expendi-
tures per capita (Exhibit 2). Similar declines
in the proportion of medical services financed
through consumer out-of-pocket payments
are reflected in the Health Care Financing
Administration's (HCFA's) National Health
Accounts.12
These low trends in out-of-pocket spend-
ing may be attributable to the rapid shifts
from conventional coverage to managed care.
Switching to an HMO reduces consumers'
out-of-pocket responsibility from a deduct-

ible of perhaps $250 and coinsurance of 20
percent to payments of $10 per physician visit
and $5 per prescription filled. For those
switching to PPO or POS products, similar
savings are available to the extent that pa-
tients use network providers. However, some
of consumers' financial gains are accompanied
by restrictions in choice and other constraints
of managed care.
CONCLUSION
When Health System Change began this an-
nual synthesis of data on cost trends two
years ago, our major challenge was to demon-
strate to readers that the decline in the rate of
increase in costs was broad and sustained.
Many were skeptical that data they had seen
reflected only the employer share of premiums
or that it reflected only the routine underwrit-
ing cycle in insurance and not the costs expe-
rienced by insurers. Now that the trends are
better understood, many want to look beyond
the present year to 1999 or 2000.
When looking to the future, we must dis-
tinguish between trends in premiums and
trends in the costs that underlie insurance.
Much of the media discussion has focused on
premiums. In the short run, low profit mar-
gins for insurers will affect the rate of growth
of premiums as insurers become less aggres-
sive in keeping prices low to expand market
share. Consequently, premium increases
could well be higher in 1999, about two years
after originally predicted by the media. But
over a slightly longer period, the dominant in-
fluence on premiums is underlying costs. An
acceleration of costs could be brought on by
the rapid introduction of new drugs and other
new technologies and by the increasing diffi-
culty that health plans have in obtaining
provider discounts. However, the expansion
of information on effectiveness, growing use
of secondary prevention, continuing excess
capacity among health care providers, and
continued aggressiveness on the part of pur-
chasers will work to hold costs down.

3. HCFA's National Health Accounts obtain a two-
way matrix of data from both providers and in-
surers. These data are generally recognized as
the "gold standard" for studying cost trends and
are used extensively by researchers and policy
analysts. Readers of Health Affairs are familiar
with these data from the regularly published
work of Katharine Levit and colleagues at the
HCFA Office of the Actuary.
The Milliman and Robertson Health Cost In-
dex (HCI) is obtained from various surveys of
providers, some widely known and some pro-
prietary. It is designed to serve as a leading indi-
cator of private health insurers' claims experi-
ence. Thus, it is limited to health services that
tend to be insured: inpatient and outpatient hos-
pital services, physician services, and prescrip-
tion drugs. Because provider revenue data tend
to cover all patients, the HCI analysts subtract
data on Medicare reimbursements. Revenues for
Medicaid and uninsured patients are not re-
moved. The HCI contains more current data
than the National Health Accounts. Because the
HCI is designed to track the experience of a pri-
vate policy with a $250 deductible, but we are
interested in tracking total expenditures, we
have obtained data adjusted to reflect a $0 de-
ductible and expanded it to include Medicare
spending.
For 1996 and ealier years, some of the esti-
mates from the National Health Accounts and
the Milliman and Robertson index have been re-
vised from those published in previous syntheses
on health care cost trends. These series are rou-
tinely revised as more complete data become
available. The implication for users of the series
is that estimates for the most recent years are
subject to more error than are those for earlier
years. This is a price we willingly pay for more
timely tracking of trends.

in health services establishments. Nonsalaried

ond quarter.

(not adjusted for inflation).
7. However, May and June 1998 data on producer
prices have reflected sharp increases in drug
prices. If this proves to be more than an aberra-
tion, it would portend an acceleration in growth
of spending for drugs.

plies. The results that we report for medical serv-
