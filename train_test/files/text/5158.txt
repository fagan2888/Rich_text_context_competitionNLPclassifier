Abstract
Objective: To investigate the association between serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1) -844 A/G
and -675 4G/5G polymorphisms and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a Chinese
Han population.
Method: SERPINE1 -844 A/G and -675 4G/5G polymorphisms were assessed by polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism sequencing of genomic DNA from patients
with COPD and healthy smoking controls.
Results: Out of 140 patients with COPD and 100 controls, all SERPINE1 -844 and -675
polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Differences in SERPINE1 -675 4G and 5G
allele frequencies were statistically significant between the COPD and control groups (odds ratio
[OR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00, 2.09), but there was no significant between-group
difference in SERPINE1 -844 A and G allele frequencies. The SERPINE1 -675 4G/4G genotype was
associated with COPD (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.06, 3.32 [binary logistic regression]). Haplotype analysis
showed that COPD was associated with SERPINE1 -844G/4G (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.32, 3.38) and
SERPINE1 -844G/5G (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45, 0.95).
Conclusion: The SERPINE1 -675 polymorphism, but not SERPINE1 -844 polymorphism, was
associated with susceptibility to COPD in a Chinese Han population.

characterized by abnormal inflammatory
responses of the lung to noxious particles
or gases.1 Persistent airway inflammation
results in airway destruction and remodel-
ling leading to progressive airway stenosis,
airflow restriction and lung function impair-
ment. Inhalation of cigarette smoke is the
most significant environmental risk factor
for the development of COPD, however, less
than 20% of long-term cigarette smokers
develop the disease,2 suggesting that genetic
factors impact the effect of cigarette smok-
ing on COPD pathogenesis.
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
is a member of serine protease inhibitor
family. PAI-1 blocks the conversion of
plasminogen to plasmin through covalent
binding to plasminogen activator, thereby
inhibiting activation of matrix metallopro-
teinases. 3 PAI-1 participates in the process
of inflammation through modulating cell
migration and levels of cytokines, such as
tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and
interferon-g in the lung.4,5 Thus, PAI-1 may
play an important role in the pathogenesis of
COPD through its effect on extracellular
matrix deposition and inflammation.
The serpin family E member 1
(SERPINE1) gene, which encodes the PAI-
1 protein, is located in chromosome 7q21.3­
q22 and contains nine exons. Several single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
been described in SERPINE1, such as -844
Adenine (A)/Guanine (G), -675 4G/5G,
43G/A, 9785G/A and 11053 Thymine (T)/
G,6,7 of which, the promoter region -844 A/
G (rs2227631) and -675 4G/5G (rs1799889)
polymorphisms have been shown to affect
SERPINE1 expression. The A allele in the -
844 A/G substitution polymorphism is asso-
ciated with increased PAI-1 mRNA and
protein levels.8,9 In terms of the SERPINE1
-675 4G/5G insertion/deletion polymorph-
ism, the 4G allele has been shown to
upregulate PAI-1 mRNA and protein
levels,10,11,12 and populations with the 4G/
4G genotype have higher plasma PAI-1
levels than those with the 4G/5G and 5G/
5G genotypes.6 SERPINE1 -844 and -675
genetic polymorphisms have been found
associated with several diseases, such as
stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, acute coronary
syndrome and metabolic syndrome, in dif-
ferent populations.6,7,9,13,14
Several studies have investigated the
association between SERPINE1 -675 4G/
5G polymorphism and chronic pulmonary
diseases, including asthma and pulmonary
fibrosis.10,15,16,17,18 The SERPINE1 -675
polymorphism is shown to be associated
with risk and severity of asthma, 10,15,16 and
to impact the effect of inhaled glucocorti-
costeroid.16 Frequency of the 4G allele is
significantly higher than the 5G allele in
patients with nonspecific interstitial pneu-
monia,17 and the SERPINE1 5G/5G geno-
type has a significant negative association
with the development of idiopathic pulmon-
ary fibrosis.18 Thus, it may be reasonable to
expect a relationship between SERPINE1
polymorphisms and COPD. One study in
Egyptian male patients, found an associ-
ation between the development of COPD
and the SERPINE1 -675 polymorphism 4G/
4G genotype.19 The present study investi-
gated whether the SERPINE1 -844 A/G and
-675 4G/5G polymorphisms were associated
with susceptibility to COPD in a Chinese
Han population.
Patients and methods
Study population
The present observational cohort study
sequentially enrolled patients with COPD
who were attending Shandong University
Qilu Hospital, Jinan, China between May
2015 and December 2015 and who con-
sented to participate in the study. COPD
was diagnosed and graded according to the
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive
Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines,1 and
comprised medical history, physical exam-
ination and post-bronchodilator forced
Xu et al. 1293
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/
forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.70. Patients
with other respiratory diseases (e.g. asthma,
lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis and
bronchiectasis) were excluded. Healthy
smokers > 45 years of age with smoking
index (cigarette packs per dayÂ number of
smoking years)! 10 pack-years who attended
Shandong University Qilu Hospital for a
routine examination were recruited as the
control group. The study was approved by
the Medical Ethics Committee of Shandong
University and all participants provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Lung function
Each participant completed a lung function
test using a MasterScreenTM computerised
spirometer (Jaeger Corp., Hoechberg,
Germany) according to American Thoracic
Society and European Respiratory Society
recommendations.20 FEV1 % predicted
(participant FEV1/predicted normal FEV1
value) and FVC % predicted (participant
FVC/predicted normal FVC value) were
calculated.
DNA extraction and genotyping
Peripheral venous blood samples (3ml) were
collected into tubes containing 1.8mg/ml
ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid and stored at
­80C prior to DNA extraction. Genomic
DNA was isolated from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells using a DNA extraction
kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Beijing, China)
according to the manufacturer's instructions,
and stored at ­20C prior to use in genotyping.
Serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1) -
844 and -675 polymorphisms were geno-
typed using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-restriction fragment length poly-
morphism sequencing. Sense and antisense
primer sequences were 50-GGACCACTG
CTCCACAGAAT-30 and 50-AACCTCC
ATCAAAACGTGGA-30, respectively
(Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering
Technology & Service, Shanghai, China),
and produced an amplified fragment length
of 591 bp. The PCR was performed in a 25 ml
reaction volume containing 60 ng of gen-
omic DNA, 3.2 pmol each of forward and
reverse primers, 0.25 ml Taq DNA polymer-
ase (Tiangen Biotech Co.), 200 mM dNTPs
(Tiangen Biotech Co.), 2.5 ml 10 Â PCR
buffer (Tiangen Biotech Co.) and 17.25 ml
double distilled H2
O. The cycling pro-
gramme involved preliminary denaturation
at 95C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95C for 30 s, annealing
at 58C for 30 s, and elongation at 72C
for 1 min, followed by a final elongation step
at 72C for 5 min. The PCR products were
purified and sequenced using a BigDyeÕ
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) with the Applied BiosystemsTM
3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative data are
presented as mean Æ SD and were analysed
by Student's t-test. Hardy-Weinberg equi-
librium was assessed using 2-test to evalu-
ate the deviation of genotype distribution.
Between-group differences in genotypes and
alleles were analysed using 2-test. Binary
logistic regression was used to assess the
association between susceptibility to COPD
and SERPINE1 -844 and -675 genotypes.
Odds ratios (ORs) for SERPINE1 -844 and -
675 polymorphisms in recessive (wild type
homozygous þ heterozygous versus minor
allele homozygous), dominant (wild type
homozygous versus heterozygous þ minor
allele homozygous), codominant (heterozy-
gous versus wild type homozygous, minor
allele homozygous verse wild type
1294 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
homozygous) and overdominant (wild type
homozygous þ minor allele homozygous
versus heterozygous) models were analysed.
Haplotypes with frequencies > 3% were
selected for analysis, and haplotype analysis
was conducted using Haploview 4.2 soft-
ware (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,
Boston, MA, USA). A P value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 140 patients with COPD were
included (69 patients with COPD grades 1
and 2 and 71 patients with COPD grades 3
and 4, according to GOLD guidelines),1 and
a total of 100 healthy smokers were included
as the control group (Table 1). There were
no statistically significant differences in sex,
age and smoking index between the COPD
and control groups. Statistically significant
between-group differences were observed in
terms of FEV1
% predicted and FVC %
predicted (P < 0.01).

A, A/G and G/G and SERPINE1 -675 4G/
4G, 4G/5G and 5G/5G genotypes are pre-
sented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.
SERPINE1 -844 A/G and -675 4G/5G
polymorphisms in the COPD and control
groups were all found to be in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (Table 2). No stat-
istically significant difference in genotype
distribution was found between the COPD
and control groups (Table 3). There was no
statistically significant difference in fre-
quency of SERPINE1 -844 polymorphism
A and G alleles between the COPD and
control groups, however, the frequency of
SERPINE1 -675 polymorphism 4G and 5G
alleles was significantly different between
patients with COPD and controls (P ¼ 0.04;
OR 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00,
2.09; Table 4).
Binary logistic regression analyses of the
whole study population showed that only
the SERPINE1 -675 4G/4G genotype was
associated with susceptibility to COPD
(P ¼ 0.03; OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.06, 3.32).
Other genotypes failed to show any associ-
ation with susceptibility to COPD (P > 0.05;
Table 5).
In terms of haplotype analyses of the
whole study population, SERPINE1 -844G/
4G showed a significantly positive associ-
ation with susceptibility to COPD
(P ¼ 0.001; OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.32, 3.38)
and SERPINE1 -844G/5G showed a statis-
tically significant inverse association with

Discussion
The present study investigated the associ-
ation between SERPINE1 -844 and -675
polymorphisms and susceptibility to COPD
in patients with COPD and healthy smokers
in a Chinese Han population. In agreement
with a published study conducted in
Egypt,19 the SERPINE1 -675 4G/5G poly-
morphism was found to be associated with
susceptibility to COPD in the present study.

COPD is a prevalent chronic airway
inflammatory disease associated with per-
sisting airway inflammation and remodel-
ling that results in airway obstruction during
disease progression. Besides environmental
factors, genetic factors are reported to affect
the development of COPD.2,23,24
Levels of PAI-1 are increased in the lung
tissues of patients with COPD, and are
associated with alveolar epithelial cell apop-
tosis and exacerbation of lung inflammation
in mice with passive cigarette smoke expos-
ure.21 PAI-1 levels in the induced sputum of
patients with COPD are significantly ele-
vated and negatively related to FEV1
%
predicted,25 and correlate with sputum mal-
ondialdehyde (MDA) in patients with
COPD.26 In addition, a positive correlation
has been reported between the amount of
collagen and the percentage of PAI-1-posi-
tive macrophages in pulmonary specimens
from patients with COPD.27 PAI-1 affects
the expression of cytokines (interleukin-8
and leukotriene B4) and monocyte migra-
tion in the inflammation induced by cigar-
ette smoke extract.5 As an important factor
which impacts airway inflammation and
remodelling, PAI-1 appears to play an
essential role in the development of asthma
and COPD. The present results suggest an
association between PAI-1 and COPD from
the aspect of genetic polymorphisms, in that
there was a significant difference between the
SERPINE1 -675 polymorphism 4G and 5G
allele between patients with COPD and
healthy smoking controls. The carriers of
SERPINE1 4G/4G genotype were shown to
have increased odds of COPD compared
with the carriers of other genotypes. It was
also apparent in haplotype analysis that the
SERPINE1 -844G/4G haplotype was a risk
factor for COPD and -844G/5G haplotype
was a protective factor for COPD. It may
be the case that the 4G allele upregulates

expression of SERPINE1 compared with
the 5G allele, and it may further promote
airway remodelling and inflammation.
The present results may be limited by the
fact that this was a single-centre study, the
study population was relatively small, and
only SERPINE1 -844 and -675 polymorph-
isms were observed. Future studies to iden-
tify the role of SERPINE1 polymorphisms
in the development of COPD should include
a larger study population and a larger
selection of SERPINE1 polymorphisms in
addition to -844 and -675.
In conclusion, SERPINE1 -675 4G/5G
polymorphism was associated with suscep-
tibility to COPD in the present Chinese Han
population, however, SERPINE1 -844 poly-
morphism did not appear to impact COPD
development.
