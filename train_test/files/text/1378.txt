Studies suggest that homocysteine may elevate blood pressure and increase the risk of hypertension. The
association of homocysteine with blood pressure and with the risk of hypertension was investigated using cross-
sectional data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1998­1994). Homocysteine had
an independent positive association with blood pressure after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. A 1
standard deviation (5 µmol/liter) increase in homocysteine was associated with increases in diastolic and
systolic blood pressure of 0.5 and 0.7 mmHg, respectively, in men and of 0.7 and 1.2 mmHg in women. Similarly,
higher levels of homocysteine were associated with an increased risk of hypertension. In a comparison of the
highest and lowest quintiles of homocysteine, women had a threefold increase in the risk of hypertension (95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.7, 5.4), and men had a twofold increase (95% CI: 0.7, 5.1). In light of the homocysteine-
blood pressure association, the association of homocysteine with prevalent cardiovascular disease was
examined with and without adjusting for blood pressure. The results support a mediating role for blood pressure
in women and suggest that the full effect of homocysteine on cardiovascular risk may be underestimated when
blood pressure is adjusted.

High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovas-
cular disease. Although its etiology has not been fully eluci-
dated mostly because of as yet unknown genetic variation,
multiple nonhereditary factors including dietary and other
lifestyle factors have been identified that have important and
modifiable influences on blood pressure (1). Nutritional
advice for the control and prevention of hypertension is
already substantial (2), but additional understanding of the
causal role of nutritional factors is important given the high
prevalence of elevated blood pressure. Recent studies
suggest that mild elevations in serum homocysteine may
contribute to elevations in blood pressure. Although contro-
versy remains as to whether the relation between homocys-
teine and cardiovascular disease is causal or not (3, 4), the
association of homocysteine with blood pressure deserves
attention because blood pressure may mediate part of the
cardiotoxic effect of homocysteine. Epidemiologic studies in
the past that controlled for blood pressure or hypertension
status may have underestimated the total effect of homocys-
teine on cardiovascular disease risk.
A causal link between homocysteine and blood pressure is
supported by experimental studies. Animal studies report an
increase in blood pressure in response to induced hyper-
homocysteinemia (5, 6). Homocysteine may elevate blood
pressure through multiple mechanisms, including its effect
on vascular endothelial integrity. Homocysteine administra-
tion caused direct endothelial cell injury in vitro (7) and in
animals (8). In cell culture studies, homocysteine induced
oxidative stress to endothelium (9) and reduced available
nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator (10). Confirming these
observations in humans, endothelium-dependent vasodila-
tion was impaired in temporary (11, 12) or chronic (13, 14)
hyperhomocysteinemia. Homocysteine-induced endothelial
dysfunction in humans was improved with administration of
folic acid and vitamin B6
(15­17).
Folate, vitamin B6
, and vitamin B12
are the major nutri-
tional determinants of homocysteine levels (18) and have a

protective association with cardiovascular disease (19­24).
The protective effect of these B vitamins may be partly
explained by mechanisms independent of homocysteine, as
suggested by several recent studies (25), and the B vitamins
may themselves affect blood pressure (26­30).
Although the association of homocysteine with blood
pressure or hypertension risk has been reported in observa-
tional epidemiologic studies (31­40), most studies were
limited by incomplete consideration of potential
confounding factors (31­35) or specific characteristics of
study subjects, such as age and pregnancy (36, 37). The few
studies that considered confounding factors provided little
quantitative information on the homocysteine-blood pres-
sure association or considered blood pressure as a determi-
nant of homocysteine (38­40).
Thus, the relation of homocysteine to blood pressure and
to hypertension was investigated using data from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III, 1988­1994). First, the homocysteine-blood
pressure association was assessed, with and without consid-
eration of folate and vitamins B6
and B12
. Second, the associ-
ation of homocysteine with prevalent hypertension was
investigated. Finally, the association of homocysteine with
prevalent cardiovascular disease was assessed to consider
whether the association was partly mediated by blood pres-
sure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Data on adults aged 17 or more years from a nationally
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized US popula-
tion were available from NHANES III (41, 42), a large-scale
cross-sectional survey. The plan and operation of the survey
have been described by the National Center for Health
Statistics (43). The Cornell University Committee on Human
Subjects approved the use of these public-domain data.
Data collection
Six seated measurements were taken for diastolic and
systolic blood pressure on two occasions: three during the
household interview and three during the medical examina-
tion. Trained interviewers and physicians took measure-
ments using a mercury sphygmomanometer (W. A. Baum
Co., Inc., Copiague, New York) according to standardized
blood pressure measurement protocols recommended by the
American Heart Association (43). The average of all avail-
able measurements was used in this study. A person was
considered to have hypertension if blood pressure met the
definition of stage 2 hypertension: elevated systolic blood
pressure (160 mmHg), elevated diastolic blood pressure
(100 mmHg), both, or use of antihypertensive medications
(44, 45).
Blood was collected and sera were stored at ­70°C until
analysis. Homocysteine was measured only in the second
phase of the survey (1991­1994) by high-performance liquid
chromatography (coefficient of variation, <6 percent) at the
US Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research
Center on Aging (46). Other biologic markers of nutritional
status, including B vitamins, antioxidants, and lipids, were
assayed at the National Center for Environmental Health
(46). Questionnaires filled out at the household interview
and medical examination provided information on demo-
graphics, dietary intake, and lifestyle factors.
Statistical analysis
With the use of linear (continuous blood pressure
outcome) and logistic (dichotomous hypertension outcome)
regression analyses, men and women were considered in
separate models after statistically significant effect modifi-
cation of the homocysteine-blood pressure association by
sex was found in a combined model. Sex-specific models
also facilitated the consideration of sex-specific confounding
variables. Metabolic (serum homocysteine, log transformed)
and nutritional (red blood cell folate, serum vitamin B12
,
dietary intake of vitamin B6
) variables were considered alone
and simultaneously to allow for direct and indirect effects.
All regression models were adjusted for the complex
sampling design by SUDAAN software (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), and anal-
yses were weighted according to National Center for Health
Statistics guidelines (47) to account for oversampling of
certain age, sex, race/ethnicity domains, and differential
nonresponse or undercoverage. In all models, potential
confounding variables were carefully considered in light of
proposed mechanisms.
RESULTS
NHANES III data on 7,612 adults with homocysteine and
blood pressure measurements comprised the study sample. A
total of 376 persons were excluded because of mixed race/
ethnicity, as recommended by the National Center for Health
Statistics (41). In analyses of blood pressure (continuous
outcome), a further 1,258 persons were excluded because
they were either pregnant (n = 133) or were taking antihyper-
tensive medications (n = 1,125, 452 had concurrent physi-
cian-diagnosed cardiovascular disease), yielding 5,978
persons for study. The analyses of hypertension (categorical
outcome) included persons taking antihypertensive medica-
tions as cases, yielding 7,103 persons for analyses of the
categorical outcome.
The mean level of homocysteine in the adults studied was
9.6 µmol/liter (standard deviation, 4.8), comparable with
previous reports (31, 48, 49). The average diastolic and
systolic blood pressure measurements increased by 3.7 and
9.3 mmHg, respectively, from the lowest to the highest quin-
tile of homocysteine, unadjusted for age (table 1). Serum
homocysteine was negatively associated with red blood cell
and serum folate and serum vitamin B12
, but the bivariate
relation with dietary vitamin B6
intake was inconsistent.
Homocysteine was positively associated with age, male sex,
postmenopausal status (defined as age 55 years), renal
dysfunction (defined by elevated levels of serum creatinine),
percentage of current smokers, serum cotinine, and total
serum cholesterol. Homocysteine was inversely associated
with high density lipoprotein cholesterol and serum vitamin

C. In addition, homocysteine had a positive association with
caffeine and a negative association with mineral/vitamin
supplement use in the past month (data not shown). There
was little or no association of homocysteine with serum
vitamin E, alcohol intake, serum C-reactive protein, poverty
income ratio, education, body mass index (weight (kg)/
height (m)2), and current use of estrogen supplements in
women (data not shown). The association of homocysteine
with demographic and lifestyle variables was similar to
previous data (50).
Homocysteine-blood pressure association
First, the homocysteine-blood pressure association was
assessed. Much of the crude positive association of
homocysteine with blood pressure was explained by age and
sex in model 0 of table 2. In sex-stratified analyses including
sex-specific confounding variables, homocysteine was posi-
tively associated with both diastolic and systolic blood pres-
sure as shown in model 1 of table 2. An increase of 5 µmol/
liter in homocysteine (about 1 standard deviation) was asso-
ciated with increases in diastolic and systolic blood pressure
of 0.5 and 0.7 mmHg, respectively, in men. The association
of homocysteine with blood pressure was stronger in women
than in men: 0.7 and 1.2 mmHg in diastolic and systolic
blood pressure, respectively. The homocysteine-sex interac-
tion was statistically significant for systolic blood pressure
(p = 0.04), and there was little or no evidence of effect modi-
fication by age in either men or women. In both men and
women, further adjusting for red blood cell folate and dietary
vitamin B6
intake only slightly attenuated the relation of
homocysteine to blood pressure as shown in model 3 of table
2. Excluding adults who reported a physician diagnosis of
cardiovascular disease (n = 224) had little or no effect on the
findings, with the exception of strengthening the homocys-
teine-systolic blood pressure association in men (coefficient
changed from 0.73 to 0.95).
Red blood cell folate and dietary vitamin B6
were nega-
tively associated with blood pressure in models that did not
adjust homocysteine, as in model 2 of table 2. The red blood
cell folate-blood pressure association was statistically signif-
icant only in women and only for systolic blood pressure
(model 2). Among women, a 1 standard deviation increase in
red blood cell folate (100 ng/ml) was associated with about a
0.5-mmHg decrease in diastolic (95 percent confidence
interval (CI): ­1.00, 0.14) and systolic (95 percent CI: ­1.24,
­0.02) blood pressure. The regression coefficient for red
blood cell folate was reduced by about a third with homocys-

teine in the model, as shown in models 2 and 3 of table 2.
The dietary vitamin B6
-blood pressure association was
stronger in men, and there was little or no change in the coef-
ficients in models including homocysteine, as shown in
models 2 and 3 of table 2. Among men, 1 standard deviation
increase in dietary vitamin B6
intake (1.3 mg/day) was asso-
ciated with a 1 mmHg decrease in both diastolic (95 percent
CI: ­1.40, ­0.06) and systolic (95 percent CI: ­1.82, ­0.26)
blood pressure. Serum vitamin B12
had little or no indepen-
dent association with blood pressure and had little or no
effect on the homocysteine-blood pressure association once
folate and vitamin B6
were adjusted (data not shown).
Other potential effect modifiers and confounders were
considered but not retained in the final models. Serum
measurements of vitamin C and vitamin E were considered
to test the hypothesis that homocysteine-related endothelial
dysfunction is mitigated by these antioxidants (11, 12), but
no effect modification was found (data not shown). Serum
total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were neither
effect modifiers nor confounders of the homocysteine-blood
pressure association. Alcohol intake (questionnaire data on
"had 12 or more drinks past year"-yes/no) slightly strength-
ened the homocysteine-systolic blood pressure association in
a subgroup of women who responded to the alcohol ques-
tionnaire (data not shown). There was no evidence of effect
modification by alcohol intake. Similarly, the homocysteine-
blood pressure association was not confounded by coffee
intake or supplement use, and it was not modified by supple-
ment use. Serum C-reactive protein, an indicator of the
acute-phase response, and serum creatinine, an indicator of

 Models in model 0, combined or sex stratified, were not adjusted for any other variables. Models in model 1 through model 3 were adjusted
for age, race/ethnicity, poverty income ratio, education, body mass index, and cigarette smoking (coded in seven variables). In women, models
were further adjusted for menopausal status (aged 55 years as a proxy variable) and current use of estrogen supplements (yes/no). Models in
model 3 are simultaneous models; that is, each model includes homocysteine, RBC folate, and dietary vitamin B6
.
§ The change in diastolic or systolic blood pressure was estimated for about a 1 standard deviation increase in logarithmic homocysteine
(from 10 to 15 µmol/liter) or by an increase in RBC folate of 100 ng/ml and in dietary vitamin B6

renal function, had little or no effect on the association of
homocysteine with blood pressure.
Homocysteine-hypertension association
Second, the association of homocysteine with prevalent
hypertension was investigated using logistic regression
(table 3). A 1 standard deviation increase (5 µmol/liter) in
homocysteine (continuous variable) was associated with a
50 percent increase in the risk of hypertension in women
only (95 percent CI: 1.12, 2.00). There was little or no asso-
ciation of the continuous homocysteine variable with preva-
lent hypertension in men (p = 0.006 for the homocysteine-
sex interaction). To allow for nonlinearity, homocysteine
was categorized into quintiles: The trend in the risk of hyper-
tension with increasing homocysteine quintiles was signifi-
cant only in women (p for trend = 0.0001). Women in the
highest quintile of homocysteine had three times (95 percent
CI: 1.7, 5.4) the risk of hypertension compared with those in
the lowest quintile. There was a positive trend in men, with
men in the highest quintile at twofold higher risk than men in
the lowest quintile (95 percent CI: 0.71, 5.14). Extending the
outcome definition and/or refining the comparison group, for
instance by excluding adults who had a physician diagnosis
of hypertension but no elevation in blood pressure and no
use of antihypertensive medication, made little or no differ-
ence in the odds ratios. Overall, there was little or no change
in these estimates when adults with physician-diagnosed
cardiovascular disease were excluded from consideration
(data not shown).
Homocysteine-cardiovascular disease association
Finally, the association of homocysteine with prevalent
cardiovascular disease was assessed. We first replicated the
recent findings of Morris et al. (49) and produced results
close to those reported (data not shown). We excluded adults
using antihypertensive medications because their medicated
blood pressure is not a fair indicator of their usual blood
pressure, and the homocysteine-blood pressure association is
attenuated in this subgroup. Next, we examined the
homocysteine-cardiovascular disease association in models
with and without blood pressure as a covariate (table 4).
When blood pressure was omitted from the model, as in
models 2 and 4 of table 4, the homocysteine-cardiovascular
disease association was slightly strengthened in women, but
there was little or no change in men. When women having
more than 12 µmol/liter were compared with women having
less than or equal to 12 µmol/liter, effect sizes were about 20
percent higher in models without blood pressure.

DISCUSSION
An increase of 5 µmol/liter in homocysteine (about 1
standard deviation) was associated with increases in dias-
tolic and systolic blood pressure of 0.5 and 0.7 mmHg,
respectively, in men and of 0.7 and 1.2 mmHg in women.
Among the B vitamins, red blood cell folate and dietary
vitamin B6
attenuated the homocysteine-blood pressure
association. In women, there was an independent association
of red blood cell folate with blood pressure. Dietary vitamin
B6
was inversely associated with blood pressure in men and
with systolic blood pressure in women. Higher levels of
homocysteine were associated with an increased risk of
hypertension. In a comparison of the highest and the lowest
quintiles of homocysteine, women had a threefold increase
in the risk of hypertension, and men had a twofold increase.
In light of the homocysteine-blood pressure association, the
association of homocysteine with prevalent cardiovascular
disease was examined with and without adjusting for blood
pressure. When blood pressure was omitted, the homocys-
teine-cardiovascular disease association was slightly
strengthened in women, but there was little or no change in
men.
The findings herein are consistent with past reports that,
although limited for various reasons, considered the relation
of homocysteine to blood pressure (38­40). Araki et al. (38)
reported that average homocysteine levels were higher in
hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects. Sutton-
Tyrrell et al. (39) found an increased risk of isolated systolic
hypertension in the elderly among those with higher
homocysteine. Neither study (38, 39) provided a quantitative
estimate of the strength of the association of homocysteine
with blood pressure throughout its continuous range. One
previous study (40) reported that blood pressure was a
significant positive predictor of homocysteine after adjusting
for age, sex, smoking status, physical activity, heart rate, and
serum total cholesterol.
Recently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, homocys-
teine-lowering trial reported a decrease in blood pressure in
response to treatment (51). Trial participants were siblings of
patients with both premature atherothrombotic disease and
abnormal postmethionine hyperhomocysteinemia. After 2
years of treatment with folic acid (5 mg/day) and pyridoxine
(250 mg/day), diastolic blood pressure decreased 1.9 mmHg
(95 percent CI: ­3.7, ­0.02), and systolic blood pressure
decreased 3.7 mmHg (95 percent CI: ­6.8, ­0.6). The
demonstration of blood pressure lowering in response to a
homocysteine-lowering intervention in an at-risk population
supports a causal association. Furthermore, the trial results
suggest that the magnitude of the homocysteine-blood pres-
sure relation may be larger than is evident from the
NHANES III data.
The association of homocysteine with blood pressure and
with hypertension was stronger in women than in men. This
was not due to a difference in the range of homocysteine or
blood pressure, and there was no evidence for differential
nonlinearity in the homocysteine-blood pressure association
in men and women. A recent meta-analysis of prospective
and case-control studies on homocysteine and coronary heart
disease reported a higher summary odds ratio of 1.92 (95
percent CI: 1.25, 2.93) in women compared with 1.46 (95
percent CI: 1.32, 1.62) in men (52). Further studies need to
be done to delineate the reasons for the gender difference.
Contrary to two clinical studies where homocysteine-
induced endothelial dysfunction was attenuated by adminis-
tration of antioxidants (11, 12), there was no evidence in the
NHANES III data of effect modification by serum vitamin C
or vitamin E. The antioxidant effect may be limited to an
acute pharmacologic dose administered in the clinical
studies (1 mg of vitamin C and 800 IU of vitamin E/day).

Homocysteine and Blood Pressure 1111
Am J Epidemiol 2002;156:1105­1113
Whether the effect modification would be observed in popu-
lations with a different range of these antioxidants should be
examined in future studies.
It has been suggested that homocysteine is an indicator of
nephrosclerosis and is elevated because of insufficient renal
excretion of homocysteine (53). Thus, the findings may arise
from reverse causality if high blood pressure aggravates
renal dysfunction, which in turn causes elevations in
homocysteine. Alternatively, renal dysfunction may be a
confounding variable related to both blood pressure and
homocysteine. In the NHANES III data, including renal
dysfunction (defined by proxy as elevated serum creatinine)
in the models had little or no effect on the homocysteine-
blood pressure association. Similarly, the results were
unchanged when we excluded subjects with prevalent
cardiovascular disease or when we adjusted for serum levels
of C-reactive protein. Thus, although cross-sectional studies
are unable to ensure the correct temporal sequence between
putative cause and effect, these findings suggest that the
homocysteine-blood pressure association was not due to an
elevation of homocysteine as a result of underlying disease.
Homocysteine may elevate blood pressure by causing arte-
rial stiffness due to impaired vascular endothelial integrity
and/or by reducing the efficiency of vasodilation (54).
Reduced methylation potential due to elevated homocysteine
and S-adenosylhomocysteine may compromise the growth
and integrity of the endothelial cells (55). In addition,
homocysteine generates free radicals during its autooxida-
tion to thiolactone (56) and inhibits the expression of anti-
oxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (9). Other
as yet unidentified mechanisms also may be at work (51).
In women, a small red blood cell folate-blood pressure
association remained after adjusting for homocysteine
levels, suggesting an independent effect of folate. An inde-
pendent role of folate is supported by evidence that it regen-
erates tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor for the
synthesis of nitric oxide (25­27). Dietary vitamin B6
was
inversely associated with blood pressure in men and with
systolic blood pressure in women. The association was inde-
pendent of homocysteine. This is consistent with previous
literature that reported an independent vitamin B6
-cardiovas-
cular disease association (20, 22, 24, 57, 58).
The findings herein support an association of homocys-
teine with blood pressure. Given within-subject variability in
a single homocysteine measurement, the observed associa-
tion may underestimate the true association by about 15
percent due to regression-dilution bias (59). Thus, the true
effect size for systolic blood pressure may be about a 1.2
mmHg increase per 5 µmol/liter increase in homocysteine
(effect size corrected for regression dilution: 0.8 and 1.5
mmHg, respectively, for men and women). The Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Study clearly
demonstrates the importance of dietary factors in lowering
blood pressure. The DASH Study diet lowered systolic
blood pressure by 5 mmHg compared with the usual Amer-
ican diet when both diets had the same intermediate level of
sodium intake (60). Further work (61) suggested that folate
intake comprises part of the difference between the DASH
Study diet and the usual American diet (168 µg/day on an
American diet vs. 418 µg/day on the DASH Study diet).
These results suggest the potential contribution of folate,
perhaps mediated by homocysteine lowering, in blood pres-
sure reduction. Thus, the current finding of an association of
homocysteine and blood pressure, if causal, would mean that
homocysteine lowering leads to reduced blood pressure with
attendant public health benefits (1).
All prospective epidemiologic studies that examined the
relation of homocysteine to coronary heart disease or stroke
controlled for either blood pressure (62­65) or hypertension
status (24, 35, 66­71) in their fully adjusted models. Recent
studies using the NHANES III data also controlled for blood
pressure in estimating the association of homocysteine with
cardiovascular disease (49) and stroke (31). However, if the
effect of homocysteine on cardiovascular outcomes is partly
mediated by blood pressure, statistical adjustment for blood
pressure or hypertension status would lead to an underesti-
mation of the total effect of homocysteine on cardiovascular
disease (72). The cross-sectional NHANES III data, which
comprise prevalent cases, are of limited use for this kind of
analysis. Although the results suggest a stronger association
of homocysteine with cardiovascular outcomes when blood
pressure was omitted as a covariate, particularly among
women, this issue deserves to be addressed with prospective
data.
This study found an independent association of homocys-
teine with blood pressure. Serum homocysteine levels were
positively associated with blood pressure and with the risk of
hypertension, confirming reports from animal experiments
(5, 6) and a small intervention trial in an at-risk population
(51). Considering that these cross-sectional findings may be
affected by lifestyle or dietary changes that lower homocys-
teine in people with high blood pressure, the homocysteine-
blood pressure association should be investigated further in a
prospective study. In addition, estimation of the magnitude
of the association of homocysteine with cardiovascular
outcomes should consider the mediating role of blood pres-
sure. Finally, a direct effect of folate supplementation on
blood pressure should be considered in examining the
benefit of folate intervention and/or food fortification
programs relative to the prevention of cardiovascular
morbidity.
