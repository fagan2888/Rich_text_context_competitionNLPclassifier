Objective: To calculate the prevalence of homicide followed by suicide (homicide/suicide) and provide
contextual information on the incidents and demographic information about the individuals involved using
data from a surveillance system that is uniquely equipped to study homicide/suicide.
Methods: Data are from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). This active state-based
surveillance system includes data from seven states for 2003 and 13 states for 2004. The incident-level
structure facilitates identification of homicide/suicide incidents.
Results: Within participating states, 65 homicide/suicide incidents (homicide rate = 0.230/100 000)
occurred in 2003 and 144 incidents (homicide rate = 0.238/100 000) occurred in 2004. Most victims
(58%) were a current or former intimate partner of the perpetrator. Among all male perpetrators of
intimate partner homicide 30.6% were also suicides. A substantial proportion of the victims (13.7%) were
the children of the perpetrator. Overall, most victims (74.6%) were female and most perpetrators were
male (91.9%). A recent history of legal problems (25.3%), or financial problems (9.3%) was common
among the perpetrators.
Conclusions: The results support earlier research documenting the importance of intimate partner violence
(IPV) and situational stressors on homicide/suicide. These results suggest that efforts to provide assistance
to families in crisis and enhance the safety of IPV victims are needed to reduce risk for homicide/suicide.
The consistency of the results from the NVDRS with those from past studies and the comprehensive
information available in the NVDRS highlight the promise of this system for studying homicide/suicide
incidents and for evaluating the impact of prevention policies and programs.
Homicide followed by suicide is a relatively rare lethal
incident in which an individual kills another and
subsequently dies by suicide, usually shortly after the
homicide.1 Past studies of homicide/suicide have estimated
rates of occurrence in the US to be between 0.2­0.38 per
100 000 persons annually.2­5 Despite this low rate of
occurrence, homicide/suicide incidents have a significant
impact on the children, families, and communities of the
victims and perpetrators.6 This study describes characteristics
of perpetrators and victims of homicide/suicide, including
nature of the relationship, location of the incident, history of
alcohol or drug use, and interpersonal violence.
Homicide/suicide incidents usually include one victim and
one perpetrator.1 In a majority of homicide/suicide incidents,
the homicide perpetrator is male, older than the victim, and is
likely to be white.5­7 A history of depression and/or mental
illness is also common among perpetrators.5 8 Victims of
these incidents are more likely to be women who have
separated or are divorced from their partners.8­9
Homicide/suicide incidents involving strangers are rare.8 In
previous studies of homicide/suicide incidents, more than
95% of the perpetrators were known to the victims.1 10 Most
often, the perpetrator was a former or current husband or
other intimate partner with the homicide taking place in the
home of the victim.9 The authors of a recent study of
homicide/suicide incidents in China were able to identify an
intimate relationship between the perpetrator and victim in
95% of the incidents.11 When comparing homicide/suicide
incidents to homicides, research has suggested that the
perpetrator is more likely to die by suicide when the motive is
related to possessiveness/jealousy, sickness, or stress and
these incidents are more likely to be premeditated than a
homicide alone.12
Alcohol or drug use is a common risk factor in homicides,
independent of the suicide of the perpetrator.13 However, the
role of alcohol or drug use in homicide/suicide incidents is
less clear as this information is not always available. In a
review of factors associated with perpetration of a homicide
followed by suicide where toxicological information was
available, 34% of the perpetrators had detectible blood
alcohol content during postmortem exams and other
substances were identifiable in 18% of that same group.6
Male perpetrators are also more likely than victims to be
under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.14
The majority of deaths associated with homicide/suicide
incidents in the US involve a gun, with handguns being used
most frequently.3 14­15 Other weapons associated with homi-
cide/suicide incidents include knives, blunt objects, and
motor vehicles; other methods of homicide have included
strangling/asphyxiation, poisoning, and physical assault.11
Approximately one quarter of homicide/suicide incidents
involve persons over the age of 55.16 While males remain the
most likely perpetrators in this age group, as many as 50% of
male perpetrators identified in a study of homicide/suicide
among the elderly identified the husband as the main
caregiver in the relationship.17 Recently, a comparison of
homicide/suicide and suicides found that perpetrators of
homicide/suicide over the age of 55 were more likely than
those who died by suicide to have reported a recent illness, to
have provided care for another, and to have a history of
domestic violence.18
This study considers the association between these char-
acteristics and perpetration or victimization in homicide/

suicide incidents using data from the National Violent Death
Reporting System (NVDRS) for the years 2003 and 2004. The
demographic characteristics for both victims and perpetrators
are compared and the association between homicide/suicide
incidents and risk factors is considered using the detailed
contextual and personal data available in the NVDRS.
DATA
The NVDRS is an active state based surveillance system that
provides a census of resident and violent deaths that occur
within the US. Six states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia) contributed
data in 2003 and an additional seven states (Alaska,
Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode
Island, and Wisconsin) began contributing data in 2004. A
violent death is defined as a death resulting from the
intentional use of any means to injure or poison oneself,
another person, or group of people. Included in the NVDRS,
therefore, are all homicides, suicides, and legal intervention
deaths, excluding legal executions and acts of war. The
NVDRS also includes unintentional firearm related deaths,
and deaths of undetermined intent occurring within the US
to assess misclassification. The NVDRS captures data in a
relational database that includes victims (deceased persons),
alleged perpetrators (deceased or live suspects), mechanisms
of injury, and other details of the incident. Details of NVDRS
methods appear in Paulozzi et al and Azrael et al.19 20
METHODS
Homicide/suicide incidents were identified by scanning the
NVDRS data sets for incidents involving at least one suicide
(abstractor assigned manner of death = 1) and one
homicide (abstractor assigned manner of death = 2). To
be considered a homicide/suicide incident in the NVDRS, a
suicide must occur within 24 hours of the homicide(s).
Under this selection criterion, 65 incidents (involving 84
homicides) were identified for the seven states covered by the
NVDRS for the year 2003 and 144 incidents (involving 164
homicides) were identified for the 13 states covered by the
NVDRS for the year 2004. For 2003, 12 of the 65 incidents
involved multiple homicides (5 double homicides, 7 triple
homicides). For 2004, 17 of the 144 incidents involved
multiple homicides (15 double homicides, 1 triple homicide,
1 quadruple homicide).
At-risk population estimates based on US Census Bureau
data21­23 were used in the calculation of incidence rates.
Recently released US Census Bureau data were also used to
determine the metropolitan, micropolitan, or rural character-
ization of individual counties in the NVDRS reporting states.
The rates by race/ethnicity, gender, and metropolitan status
were age adjusted to the US standard population for the year
2000, using the direct method of standardization.24
Analysis of incidence rates for rare occurrences or condi-
tions often relies on the assumption that cases occur
according to a homogeneous Poisson process.25­27 Because of
the frequent clustering of victims associated with homicide/
suicide incidents, the independence assumption inherent in
this approach is violated. Therefore, an alternate method
which compensates for such clustering was used to calculate
confidence intervals.28 The adjustment for clustering resulted
in some confidence intervals, based on otherwise stable rate
estimates, that are as much as 25% wider than those
calculated without such adjustment.
These analyses consider incidents at both the victim
(n = 248 homicides) and incident (or perpetrator) level
(n = 209). Frequencies were calculated using the appropriate
denominator for the selected level of analysis. Complete data
were not available for every incident. The number of cases
missing information on any measure is provided in the table.
Data on circumstance, relationship, and individual char-
acteristics were often consolidated from multiple measures.
Often a single element (for example, intimate partner
violence) is abstracted from multiple sources. To ensure
more complete representation, all available information was
used to identify cases. For example, an incident can be
identified as intimate partner violence related using informa-
tion taken from child fatality reviews, medical examiner
records, or police reports. In these analyses an incident is

considered to have a given characteristic if it is indicated in
any of the available data sources. Some NVDRS data lack the
contextual information necessary for a complete considera-
tion of differences. For example, the measure, ``crisis in the
past 2 weeks'' is entered by the data abstractor when
sufficient information indicating a personal crisis is available.
Examples of possible crises included in the NVDRS coding
manual include recent or impending arrest, relationship
breakup, financial loss, and loss of social standing.
Exacerbations of chronic conditions should not be coded as
a crisis. Exact information on the nature of the crisis is
unavailable in the data.
Tests of significance in the percentage of homicide victims
and perpetrators who died by suicide were calculated using
x2 tests of difference. Fisher's exact test was used when
expected cell counts were less than 5.
RESULTS
Among all incidents included in the NVDRS data, homicide/
suicide incidents are a relatively rare occurrence. In 2003,
with seven states reporting, there were 65 homicide/suicide
incidents including 84 homicide victims (homicide rate =
0.230/100 000 persons) and 65 suicides (suicide rate =
0.177/100 000 persons). In 2004, with 13 states participating,
there were 144 homicide/suicide incidents, including 164
homicides (homicide rate = 0.238/100 000 persons) and 144
suicides (suicide rate = 0.205/100 000).
The NVDRS allows a calculation of the percentage of all
homicides that are followed by suicide. During the two years
examined, the proportion of female homicide perpetrators
who subsequently died from suicide was consistently small
regardless of whether the homicide victim was an intimate
(5.6% of 126) or non-intimate (3.4% of 294). Among male
perpetrators, nearly one third (30.6%) of those who killed
their intimate partner (n = 438) also ended their own lives,
while only 1.7% of those who killed a non-intimate
(n = 3459) also killed themselves.
A detailed comparison of age adjusted rates for homicide
victims stratified by age, race/ethnicity, gender, and metro-
politan status is presented in table 1. Overall, there were few
significant differences among incident rates when the
characteristics of homicide victims were considered. Young
children and adolescents were significantly less likely than
those over the age of 65 years to die from a homicide in a
homicide/suicide incident in 2004. There were no other
significant age differences among homicide victims in
homicide/suicide incidents when compared to those over
the age 65 in either year. There were also no significant racial
or ethnic differences among homicide victims when com-
pared to non-Hispanic white victims. There are significant
differences in the age adjusted rate of homicide victims
according to gender. In both 2003 and 2004, the rate of
homicides among females was significantly higher than the
rate for males; with the rate for females in both years being
over twice the rate for males. While the majority of homicide
victims lived in a metropolitan area, the age adjusted rate of
victimization for both metropolitan and micropolitan area
residents was not significantly different from those living in
non-metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).

homicide victims and perpetrators for the years 2003 and
2004 combined. When compared to the percentage of victims

in the same age category, children and young adults (,25
years of age) were significantly less likely to be perpetrators
of homicide. Members of these age groups were also likely to
be involved in multi-victim incidents. In 2003 and 2004 there
were 29 multiple victim incidents. Seventy six percent of
these incidents (n = 22) involved victims younger than 25
years of age and 48% (n = 14) involved at least one person
younger than 15 years of age. In 2003 and 2004 there were 30
homicide victims younger than 15 years of age involved in 23
homicide/suicide incidents. In 17 (73.9%) of those incidents
the perpetrator was identified as a parent.
A parent was identified as the suspect for five homicide/
suicide incidents with 12 victims age 15 or younger in 2003;
including two incidents with more than one victim under 15.
In four (80.0%) of these incidents, including both multiple
victim homicide/suicide incidents, the perpetrator was
identified as the father. In 2004 there were 12 homicide/
suicide incidents involving children under the age of 15 years;
including three multiple victim incidents. The mother was
identified as the perpetrator for eight (66.7%) of these
incidents; including all three incidents involving more than
one victim under the age 15.
The majority of victims and perpetrators involved in
homicide/suicide incidents were non-Hispanic white.
Slightly more than 20% of perpetrators and victims were
identified as African American. Of note, the percentage of
African Americans involved in homicide/suicide incidents is
higher than their representation in participating states
(approximately 16.7% in both years). There were no
significant racial or ethnic differences between homicide
victims and perpetrators.
There were few marital status differences between perpe-
trators and homicide victims. Perpetrators were significantly
more likely than victims to be widowed and victims were
significantly more likely to be single. About one in three
victims and perpetrators were married at the time of the
incident.
Perpetrators of homicide/suicide incidents were significantly
more likely than homicide victims to have a high school
education or to have not completed high school at the time of
the incident. Small percentages of perpetrators and victims had
completed a graduate or professional degree. There were no
significant differences in college or advanced degrees.
Perpetrators of homicide/suicide were not significantly more
likely than victims to test positive for either illegal drugs or
alcohol during postmortem toxicological evaluations.
The distribution of homicide victims by their relationship
to the perpetrator is shown in table 3. Homicide victims in
intimate partner violence incidents were significantly more
likely to have been killed by a current or ex-spouse,
boyfriend, or girlfriend. For homicides involving other family
members, the incident was significantly less likely to be
related to intimate partner violence than to some other factor.
Regardless of intimate partner violence status, the majority of
homicides occurred within either the victim's or perpetrator's
home. There were no significant differences in location when
intimate partner violence related and other types of incidents
were compared. ``Mercy'' killings, where one individual kills
another to end his/her suffering, were rare. Mercy killings
were identified using an abstractor coded variable based on
available information including incident narratives. There
were seven homicides determined to be mercy killings with
85.7% (n = 6) of victims over the age 55.
Some situational factors associated with a homicide/suicide
incident included whether the incident was associated with
jealousy (that is, a ``lovers' triangle''), whether more than one
victim was involved, and if the suicide occurred in the same
location as the homicide. Only four (1.9%) homicide/suicide
incidents in 2003 and 2004 were associated with jealousy and
few involved more than one victim (13.9%). Most suicides
(82.2%) following a homicide/suicide incident occurred in the
same location as at least one of the homicides.
As shown in table 4, specific situational factors associated
with suicide were recent legal problems (25.3%), a job or
financial problem (9.3%), or some other relationship problem
not related to IPV (8.8%). While only 7.2% were known to
have ever been treated for mental health problems, 11% had

evidence of a current mental illness and 8.6% were
considered depressed at the time of the incident. Nearly 1
in 10 perpetrators (9.1%) had evidence of a drug or alcohol
abuse problem. In a minority of cases, the individual had a
history of previous suicide attempts (2.6%) and 30 (15.5%) of
those who died by suicide left a suicide note suggesting
premeditation.
Table 5 shows a comparison of weapons used in homicides
and suicides. Firearms were used in a majority of homicide/
suicide incidents for both homicides (82.7%) and suicides
(80.4%). The next most common weapon used in both
homicides and suicides were sharp instruments (5.7%).
Among suicides, the head, face, or neck was the most
frequent (90.6%) location of the wound and most suicides
had only one wound location (97.6%). While the head area
was also the most common location among homicide victims
(72.1%), a much greater percentage of victims had wounds in
multiple locations (22.2%).
DISCUSSION
The data on homicide/suicide incidents collected in the first
two years of the NVDRS provide support for the patterns
observed in earlier studies of populations in smaller
geographic areas. Specifically, the findings that most
homicide victims in homicide/suicide incidents are female
and most homicide perpetrators are male, that over half
(58%) of the victims are current or former intimate partners
of the perpetrator, that less than 5% of homicide/suicide
incidents occur between strangers, that most homicide/
suicide incidents (82.3%) occur in a residence, and that most
deaths (81.6%) result from a gunshot wound are all
consistent with past research on homicide/suicide.3 14 15 As
is the case in other studies, the majority of incidents are
attributed to IPV, a substantial proportion include the
homicide of a child, and a small proportion can be attributed
to ``mercy'' killings.
The finding that 30.6% of all male perpetrators of intimate
partner homicide ultimately ended their own lives highlights
the importance of both IPV and suicidal ideation in under-
standing the factors contributing to risk for homicide/suicide.
The circumstance information available in the NVDRS provides
insights into the nature of the homicide/suicide incidents and
contributes to the growing body of literature on potential risk
factors for homicide/suicide. The fact that 11% of perpetrators
had documented mental illness at the time of the incident and
29% tested positive for drugs or alcohol is consistent with past
research documenting the importance of mental health and
substance abuse disorders in predicting risk for suicidal
behavior and violence.3 5 Also, the finding that one in four
perpetrators had experienced legal problems, nearly one in 10
had experienced job or financial problems, and approximately
one in 16 had experienced physical health problems that were
associated with their suicide underscores the importance of
situational factors for exacerbating risk. Those who work with
victims or perpetrators of IPV, suicidal patients, and those
caring for seriously ill family members should be alert for
situational stressors that may contribute to the possibility of
violence or suicide. The current results, combined with those
from other studies, also underscore the importance of
prevention programs and policies that increase the availability
of treatment for mental health and substance abuse problems,
the accessibility of shelters for victims of IPV, and the
enforcement of existing domestic violence laws.10
This manuscript provides basic descriptive information
about the prevalence of homicide/suicide and the character-
istics of the people involved. Additional research is needed to
understand how the demographic factors and experiences of
the people involved in homicide/suicide incidents differ from
those involved in homicide-only or suicide-only incidents. A
better understanding of the similarities and differences in
these incidents can help guide the development of prevention
programs and policies.
There are several limitations that should be considered
when making conclusions from these results. First, although
the use of multiple data sources enhances the accuracy of the
data in the NVDRS, it is still possible that some homicide/
suicide incidents were not identified in the system. Thus, the
rates calculated are likely an underestimate of the true
prevalence. Second, the operationalization of homicide/
suicide used in the current study does not include incidents
where law enforcement officers used lethal force against a
homicide offender because of the offender's actions (for
example, raising a firearm at an officer), although some have
suggested that such incidents could be included as homicide/
suicide.28 Third, the data on the behavioral and mental health
history of perpetrators are subject to error from both a lack of
information routinely reported in official records and the
absence of detailed individual histories obtained during case
investigations. When detailed histories are available the
source of information may be a family member or close
friend and are of unknown accuracy. While it is likely that
reports of the presence of behaviors or symptoms are
accurate, the absence of this information does not necessarily
mean that the behaviors or symptoms did not occur.
The consistency of the NVDRS results with those from past
studies on homicide/suicide and the comprehensive informa-
tion available about the characteristics of all the people
involved in these incidents highlight the promise of the
NVDRS for studying homicide/suicide incidents. Previous
efforts to describe the epidemiology of homicide/suicide
incidents have frequently relied on manual record linkages3
or systematic reviews of newspaper accounts.16 The NVDRS
allows for easy identification of homicide/suicide incidents by
keeping the homicide and suicide linked within an incident. As
more years of data become available and the number of states
included in the NVDRS system continues to increase, this
system will provide an efficient mechanism for monitoring
temporal changes in homicide/suicide prevalence, describing

the characteristics of homicide/suicide victims, perpetrators,
and incidents, comparing rates across states, and evaluating
the impact of prevention programs and policies.
In conclusion, although homicide/suicide is a rare incident,
each incident results in at least two deaths and frequently
includes the death of a child. While other countries have
national surveillance systems that capture homicide/suicide
incidents, the US does not.29 Researchers have called for the
development of a national system in the US to permit
prospective monitoring of the prevalence and epidemiology of
homicide/suicide.4 30­31 The NVDRS has the potential to
develop into a system that can be used for these purposes.

Key points
N Homicide followed by suicide (homicide/suicide) is a
relatively rare event, defined here as one person killing
one or more others and then taking his/her own life
within 24 hours.
N Most perpetrators of homicide/suicide events were
male (92%); most victims were the perpetrator's current
or former intimate partner (58%).
N Our results suggest the appropriateness of both
targeted prevention efforts for victims and
perpetrators of intimate partner violence and main-
tenance of awareness of increased homicide/suicide
risk following situational stressors.
