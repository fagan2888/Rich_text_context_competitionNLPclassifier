Protective Factors Can Mitigate Behavior Problems
After Prenatal Cocaine and Other Drug Exposures
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Prenatal cocaine exposure is
associated with the trajectories of childhood behavior problems.
Exposure effects may also be related to maternal use of other
substances during pregnancy, and risk factors other than
prenatal exposure may augment the detrimental cocaine effects.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The balance between cumulative risk
and protective indexes predicts behavior outcomes, independent
of prenatal drug exposure. A high protective index even with
a high level of risks can mitigate the detrimental effects of drug
exposure on behavior problem trajectory.
abstract
BACKGROUND: We determined the role of risk and protective factors on
the trajectories of behavior problems associated with high prenatal
cocaine exposure (PCE)/polydrug exposure.
METHODS: The Maternal Lifestyle Study enrolled 1388 children with or
without PCE, assessed through age 15 years. Because most women
using cocaine during pregnancy also used other substances, we an-
alyzed for the effects of 4 categories of prenatal drug exposure: high
PCE/other drugs (OD), some PCE/OD, OD/no PCE, and no PCE/no OD.
Risks and protective factors at individual, family, and community
levels that may be associated with behavior outcomes were entered
stepwise into latent growth curve models, then replaced by cumu-
lative risk and protective indexes, and finally by a combination of
levels of risk and protective indexes. Main outcome measures were
the trajectories of externalizing, internalizing, total behavior, and
attention problems scores from the Child Behavior Checklist (parent).
RESULTS: A total of 1022 (73.6%) children had known outcomes. High
PCE/OD significantly predicted externalizing, total, and attention problems
when considering the balance between risk and protective indexes. Some
PCE/OD predicted externalizing and attention problems. OD/no PCE also
predicted behavior outcomes except for internalizing behavior. High level
of protective factors was associated with declining trajectories of
problem behavior scores over time, independent of drug exposure
and risk index scores.
CONCLUSIONS: High PCE/OD is a significant risk for behavior problems
in adolescence; protective factors may attenuate its detrimental effects.
Clinical practice and public health policies should consider enhancing
protective factors while minimizing risks to improve outcomes of drug-
exposed children. Pediatrics 2012;130:e1479­e1488

Reports on long-term effects of pre-
natal cocaine exposure (PCE) indicate
an association between PCE and be-
havior problems, including inattention
and early onset of substance use.1­5
Studies also show that PCE effects are
related to levels of exposure.5,6 In ad-
dition, the detrimental effects of high
PCE on externalizing behavior prob-
lems remains through age 13 years
after controlling for other factors.7
Investigationshavealsofoundthateffects
noted after PCE are related to maternal
or environmental factors.6,8­12 In addi-
tion, gender seems to moderate the
PCE effects on behavior outcomes.4,13­15
Imaging studies suggest that PCE has
a long-term effect on white matter in-
tegrity andbrainvolumes(ie,adecrease
in cortical brain volume). However, these
changes are interacting with other drug
effects.16,17 Indeed, in human studies, it is
difficult to differentiate the prenatal co-
caine effects from other drugs (OD).
Women using cocaine during pregnancy
are more likely to use OD, illegal or
legal.12,18,19 Each of these drugs could
alter in utero programming of brain
development, contributing to later be-
havioral outcomes.
In addition, postnatal environment and
early childhood experiences may in-
fluence behavior8­10 with or without
prenatal drug exposure.20,21 These fac-
tors include postnatal drug exposures,
child's exposure to violence, and care-
taker psychopathology.3,5,6,22 However,
in addition to the risks for disruptive
behavior,1 any long-term effect of PCE
may be offset or compensated by re-
silience and protective factors. Hence,
the balance between risk and pro-
tective factors needs consideration in
determination of PCE effects.
We therefore assessed whether the
effects of high levels of PCE/polydrug
exposure on childhood behavior will
persist through adolescence. We also
determined the roles of risk and pro-
tective factors on the trajectories of
behavior outcomes in the presence of
PCE and other prenatal drug exposure.
Our hypothesis was that the detri-
mental effects of high PCE/polydrug
exposure on the trajectories of behav-
ior problems will persist through ado-
lescence. We further hypothesized that
risk conditions will have cumulative
effects on behavior outcomes while
protective factors will attenuate se-
verity of behavioral alterations in PCE/
polydrug exposure.
METHODS
The Maternal Lifestyle Study, a longitu-
dinal cohort study, assessed outcomes
of children with prenatal cocaine or
opiate exposure in 4 centers, with
a Statistics­Data Coordinating Center
(DCC) and a Neurobehavioral Battery
Center.23,24 Each site had approval from
the institutional review board and held
a certificate of confidentiality issued
from the National Institute on Drug
Abuse. The biological parent gave writ-
ten consent for study enrollment; older
children later gave assent. Selection of
subjects for follow-up occurred at birth
between 1993 and 1995.24 Exposed chil-
dren were born to mothers who ad-
mitted to cocaine or opiate use or had
positive meconium assays for cocaine
or opiate metabolites. Nonexposed com-
parison children were chosen within
site, matched by gestational age, gender,
race, and ethnicity. Longitudinal follow-
up began at the visit at age 1 month,
adjusted for preterm birth.
PCE was categorized into high, some,
and no exposure. High PCE referred to
use $3 times per week in the first
trimester, and some cocaine use re-
ferred to any other use.25­27 Because
most women using cocaine during
pregnancy are also using marijuana,
opiates, alcohol, tobacco, or OD,12,18,19 4
categories of drug use during preg-
nancy were created: high PCE with
other drug exposure (high PCE/OD),
some PCE/OD, no PCE but exposure to
OD (PCE­/OD+), and those with neither
PCE nor OD exposure (PCE­/OD­). This
categorization provides a practical ap-
proach for PCE because most cocaine
users are polydrug users. Other inves-
tigators have used similar exposure
groups but without levels of PCE.28,29
We also selected child, family, and com-
munity factors that have been reported
as added risks or may be protective
against behavior problems.7­9,29­32
Table 1 shows the risk and protective
factors. From these factors, the final
variables in the growth curve models
were derived. Male gender has been
associated with increased risk for
externalizing behavior.13,15,33 Smaller
head circumference referred to birth
measurement below the 25th percen-
tile. BMI was calculated at each visit
from child measurements; high BMI
or obesity has been related to child-
hood and adolescent behavior out-
comes.34,35 The verbal and full IQ were
derived from the Wechsler Abbrevi-
ated Scale of Intelligence (Pearson
Education, Inc, San Antonio, TX).36 Dur-
ing each visit, the caretakers were in-
terviewed regarding their current use
of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana;
experience of domestic violence; and
child protective services involvement
(eg, child abuse).37 To assess care-
taker depression, the Beck Depression
Inventory was administered,38,39 and
for caretaker anxiety and psychologi-
cal symptoms, the Brief Symptom In-
ventory was used.40 We determined
exposure to violence by using A Sur-
vey of Community Violence.41
Child resilience is a domain from the
ChildHealthandIllnessProfile­Adolescent
Edition (The Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD).42 From the Strange
Situation procedure43 at 18 months, we
noted whether caretaker­child attach-
ment was secure.27 The Home Observa-
tion and Monitoring of Environment
survey44 indicated the quality of the
home as observed during home visits.
e1480 BADA et al
From the Child Heath and Illness Pro-
file­Parent report,45 we derived the
scores for caretaker involvement and
the child's number of friends. The Su-
pervision Questionnaire­Primary Care-
taker46 was used to assess facets of
parental supervision and knowledge of
youth's whereabouts. Information was
obtained on employment, household
income, and other socioeconomic sta-
tus variables to derive the Hollingshead
Index of Social Position.47­49 The Family
Support Scale and the Family Resource
Scale50 were used to assess social
support and basic resources available
to the family. The Neighborhood Scale51
had questions on probability of success
of those in the neighborhood, problems,
and services. We interviewed care-
takers about the child's participation
in school, community, and church ac-
tivities.52 The caretaker was the re-
spondent to all questionnaires, except
for the Child Health and Illness Profile­
Adolescent Edition, which was adminis-
tered to the youth. For continuous vari-
ables, we calculated the means across
years and used these averages for anal-
yses. Multiple imputation was used for
missing values on the risk and protective
factors.53
Study outcomes are behavior problems
at ages 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 years
measured by using the Child Behavior
Checklist (CBCL).54 A trained research
interviewer administered the CBCL
verbally to all caretakers to ensure
uniform administration across sites.
We derived the raw scores for the CBCL
internalizing, externalizing, total be-
havior, and attention scales.55
Statistical Analysis
Risk and protective factors were com-
pared across the exposure groups by
using analysis of variance for continu-
ous variables and x2 tests for cate-
gorical variables. We conducted latent
growth curve (LGC) modeling by using
the Mplus56 software to estimate tra-
jectories of CBCL scores over time and
examine differences in trajectories
according to prenatal drug exposure
and risk and protective factors while
accounting for clustering of children by
site. The risk and protective factors for
the final models were selected by using
a backward stepwise approach, re-
taining all factors with P , .10 on the
intercept and/or slope, controlling for
drug exposure. Factors were included
in the final models if they remained in
the stepwise models forany of the CBCL
scores. The risk and protective factor
indexes represented the number of the
significant risks or protective factors,
with a point assigned to each factor
with a yes response, or when the av-
erage scores or ratings were at the
75th percentile or higher.
In addition to examining the individual
factors and the index scores as pre-
dictors of trajectories of behavior
problems, we also examined the com-
binationoflevelsofrisksandprotective
indexestoindicatethebalancebetween
risks and protective factors. A median
split was used to classify risk and
protective indexes as high versus low.
Low-risk index refers to a cumulative
risk index ,3; a score $3 indicates
high-risk index. Low and high pro-
tective indexes represent cumulative
scores ,2 and $2, respectively.

PCE. Compared with the 366 (26.4%)
children excluded from analysis, those
included had higher birth weight (P =
.048), were more likely to be dis-
charged from the hospital with their
mother (P , .001), had mothers of
younger age (P = .036) who were more
likely to be black (P , .001), and had
higher levels of maternal education
(P = .002). The proportions of high,
some, and no PCE did not differ be-
tween subjects included versus not
included in the analysis.
Table 2 shows mean scores of inter-
nalizing, externalizing, total, and atten-
tion problems for each year according
to the 4 exposure categories. The table
also includes proportions or means of
other prenatal exposures. Of mothers in
the high PCE/OD group, 97% used an-
other substance in addition to cocaine.
Risk and protective factors were also
compared among the exposure groups.
Children with high PCE/OD had signifi-
cantly greater externalizing and total
problem scores than those with PCE­/
OD­ (P , .05) after controlling for risk
and protective factors (Table 3). Nei-
ther some PCE/OD nor PCE­/OD+ pre-
dicted the intercept or slope of any of
the behavior problems. Male gender
was associated with significantly more
externalizing, total, and attention scores
at 5 years (intercepts); in addition, male
children had significantly lower slopes
over time for externalizing and in-
ternalizing behaviors. Low verbal IQ was
linked to higher initial scores on exter-
nalizing, total, and attention problems.
Continuing caretaker use of tobacco or
alcohol predicted externalizing and
total behavior problems. Caretaker
psychopathology had significant as-
sociation with all outcomes, and de-
pression predicted internalizing and
total problems. Child abuse was a pre-
dictor of total and attention problems
at 5 years (intercepts) and was also
associated with increasing externaliz-
ing and total problem scores over time
(slopes).
High resilience predicted lower scores
on all outcomes. Having many friends
wasassociatedwithlowerinternalizing
and attention problem scores and
a decrease in scores at later ages for
internalizing (B [SE] = ­0.19 [0.090], P =
.042) and total problems (B [SE] = ­0.81
[0.32], P = .012). Availability of family
resources was significantly associated
with lower scores on all behavior
outcomes except for externalizing
problems. Caretaker involvement was
significantly associated with decreases
on all behavior scores over time.
When the cumulative risk and pro-
tective indexes for each subject re-
placed the individual factors in the LGC
model (Table 4, model 2), high PCE/OD
remained a significant predictor for
externalizing problems. Some PCE/OD
did not predict behavior outcomes.
PCE­/OD+ was associated only with
increasing internalizing behavior scores
(slope) with increasing age. The risk in-
dex was a significant predictor of all
behavior problems but did not predict
significant changes in scores over time.
The protective index predicted lower
scores in all problems and a significant
decreaseinscoresover time(slopes)for
internalizing, total, and attention prob-
lems. For risk index, the coefficient (SE)
for the intercept was 2.14 (0.20) (P ,
.001) for externalizing problems; for the
protective index, the coefficient (SE) for
the intercept was ­0.88 (0.24) (P , .001).
Therefore, for externalizing problems, an
increase in number of risk factors by 1
would be associated with 2.14-point in-
crease in externalizing scores, whereas
an increase of 1 in the number of pro-
tective factors would be associated with
a 0.88-point reduction in externalizing
scores.
With the balance between risk and
protectiveindexesinthefinalLGCmodels
(Table 4, model 3), all drug-exposed
groups predicted externalizing behav-
ior, with the highest coefficient in high
PCE/OD. Scores declined with age, but
slopes did not differ from PCE­/OD­.
High PCE/OD also predicted total prob-
lems. All drug exposure groups were
associated with attention problems
(intercepts); slopes were no different
from PCE­/OD­.
The balance between risk and pro-
tective indexes was significantly asso-
ciated with all behavior outcomes. A
high-risk index in the presence of low
protective index added to the already
significant effects of drug exposure.
Conversely, a high protective index in
the presence of a high-risk index miti-
gated the predicted associated in-
creased behavior scores from drug
exposure.Amongchildrenwithlow-risk
indexes, those who also had low pro-
tective indexes experienced smaller
declines (slopes) in behavior problems
over time compared with those with
highprotectiveindexesforinternalizing
(B [SE] = 0.29 [0.10], P = .004) and total
scores (B [SE] = 1.00 [0.36], P = .005). In
addition, although not statistically sig-
nificant, similar trends were found for
externalizing (B [SE] = 0.27 [0.15], P =
.062) and attention (B [SE] = 0.12 [0.07],
P = .065) problems (Table 4, model 3).
Furthermore, when compared with
children with low risk and high pro-
tective index scores, children with high
risk and low protective index scores
had smaller declines in total problem
scores (B [SE] = 1.25 [0.47], P = .008)
and attention problem scores (B [SE] =
0.23 [0.09], P = .008).
To illustrate the influence of risk and
protective indexes on behavior prob-
lems, Fig 1 presents the LGCs of CBCL
total problem scores over time ac-
cording to levels of risk and protective
indexes separately in the 4 exposure
groups. In the high PCE/OD, the high
risk­low protective group had signifi-
cantly higher total problem scores at
5 years (intercept) than the other
groups (P , .05). The groups with low

protective scores generally had flatter
curves than those with high protective
scores, which seemed to decline over
time. Although the differences in slopes
between these groups were not sig-
nificant when compared individually,
there was a significant difference in
slopes when comparing the 2 low
protective groups with the 2 high pro-
tective groups (t[112] = ­2.16, P = .033),
supporting this general trend based on
level of protective influences. Among
youths with some PCE/OD, 3 of the 4
groups differed by initial scores at 5
years (P , .05) and had similar slopes
over time. However, although the
remaining high risk­high protective
group had scores at 5 years similar to
the high risk­low protective group,
they experienced significantly greater
declines in problem behaviors over
time (P = .039). Similar patterns of the
influence of protective factors were
observed among the 2 groups without
PCE (Fig 1). The groups with high pro-
tective index scores had significantly
different slopes than those with low
protective index scores; they declined
over time while the low protective
groups generally remained flat.
DISCUSSION
After consideration of the balance be-
tween risk and protective indexes, high
PCE/OD had continued effects on ex-
ternalizing, total, and attention behav-
ior problems through adolescence. The
effects of high PCE/OD on externalizing
and total problems were greater than
those from other categories of expo-
sure. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to explore the effects of PCE as
a polydrug problem while considering
the balance between cumulative risk
and protective factors.
Most studies highlighted the associ-
ated risks for adverse outcomes of
children with PCE.3,5,7,11 PCE is only 1 of
many individual-level factors and re-
presents in utero programming result-
ing in fetal adaptation with long-lasting
consequences. Moreover, PCE signals
multiple risks in a child's environment.

drug exposure grow up in homes and
communities with violence, with a care-
taker who continues to use drugs and
has comorbidities or psychological dis-
tress associated with her ongoing drug
use, low socioeconomic status, and
lack of social support.29,57­59 As child
development progresses, the environ-
ment expands, and adverse multiple
higher-level family and community
factors add to the risk from PCE, ex-
posing a child to an accumulation of
risks for later psychopathology.60
Nonetheless, not all children or ado-
lescents have behavioral alterations
after prenatal drug exposure. Resil-
ience, an individual characteristic,
serves as a protective trait in adverse
conditions. Investigators have also
suggested that resilience can be con-
ceptualized as a process.32 It changes
within and across time, and adaptation
results from the interaction of risks
and protective factors. Specifically,
the protective factors at multilevels
can enhance the individual's capacity
to respond or adapt to adverse con-
ditions.32,61
From the National Youth Survey of
Adolescents, multilevel factors pre-
dicted or mitigated problem behav-
iors.31 Youth who spent longer time
with deviant friends and less time with
family had higher levels of problem
behaviors over time while those
spending more time with family per-
ceived greater family support and
exhibited fewer problem behaviors.
Also, higher levels of family involvement
and parental monitoring predicted a
lesser likelihood of problem behav-
iors.30,62 Our findings support the miti-
gating influence of protective factors at
individual, family, and societal levels on
youth behavior problems. Therefore,
targets for interventions will need to
consider resources at multiple levels.32
Our study did have some limitations.
Ourclassificationofprenatalexposures
does not allow for determination of
specificeffects ofcocaineoreach ofthe
ODofexposure.However,ourpragmatic
approach as to exposure categories,
enabled us to compare PCE together
with OD from drug use with no cocaine.
The fact that we found a greater effect
from high PCE than some PCE suggests
a dose-response relationship; estab-
lishing causality requires further
studies. Also, we did not examine me-
diation models to determine if PCE may
have affected protective factors and
thus altered behavior outcomes. We
used behavior measures from the
caretakers' reports, but school behav-
ior problems may differ from those
observed at home. Still, a significant,
although modest, relationship exists
between caretaker and teacher report
of childhood and preadolescent be-
havior.7,63 The CBCL only provides
broadband measures without the
details from direct observation.
Generalizability of our results may be
limited to subjects recruited from ur-
ban, high-poverty neighborhoods, but
this population is at risk for disparities
in physical and mental health, an im-
portant factor in designing inter-
vention. Those lost to follow-up may
have moved to a higher-risk environ-
ment, and our findings are under-
estimates of effects of risk factors.

CONCLUSIONS
Our findings are pertinent in the care
of substance-using women and their
children, regardless of whether their
choices include cocaine or OD. Prenatal
drugexposureisonly1ofmanyrisksfor
later behavior problems, but exposure
does not necessarily portend dismal
outcomes. Clinical practice and public
health policies should address drug use
prevention, risk reduction (eg, violence
prevention), and interventions to en-
hanceprotectivefactorsatmultiplelevels
(eg, parenting and foster care training,
programs addressing child's friendship
skills, interpersonal problem-solving
skills),67 thereby strengthening the
