Retail payments at a crossroads: economics, strategies and future policies
This paper was submitted and accepted for the bi-annual retail payments conference titled "Retail payments at a crossroads: economics,
strategies and future policies" organised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Banque de France (BdF), on 21 and 22 October
2013 in Paris. The aim of the conference was to bring together academics, regulators and market participants to discuss possible
developments and dynamics that will shape the future retail payments landscape.
Retail payments provide a very important, yet not the most visible, infrastructure for the operation of the real economy. The way
economic actors pay is not only important from a theoretical point of view but also from a policy perspective as the costs for providing
payment services are substantial in most countries. As we are witnessing a transformation in these markets from traditional paper-based
payment instruments towards electronic means of payments, the interaction between market forces and regulatory initiatives continues
to be a determining factor for the future. This interaction, and the possible policy conclusions stemming from it, was the main theme
of this conference.
The selection and refereeing process of this paper has been carried out by the conference organisational team composed of experts
from both organising institutions. As the conference was organised with a focus on the key issues above, papers were selected not only
based on their standalone quality but also considering the relevance of the research subject to the themes of the event. Following the
conference the selected papers have been asked to be revised according to the discussants assigned to the respective paper.
The paper is released in order to make the working papers and accompanying research submitted to the conference publicly available.

Abstract
We measure consumers' use of cash by harmonizing payment diary surveys from seven
countries. The seven diary surveys were conducted in 2009 (Canada), 2010 (Australia), 2011
(Austria, France, Germany and the Netherlands), and 2012 (the United States). Our paper finds
cross-country differences ­ for example, the level of cash usage differs across countries. Cash
has not disappeared as a payment instrument, especially for low-value transactions. We also
find that the use of cash is strongly correlated with transaction size, demographics, and point-of-
sale characteristics such as merchant card acceptance and venue.

Research Question
This paper measures consumers' use of cash by employing micro-economic evidence from
seven countries. Innovations in how payments are conducted raise the question whether cash
still plays a role for consumers' purchases. We also shed light on who uses cash, for which
purchases and at which locations. Data from large-scale payment diary surveys conducted
between 2009 and 2012 in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and
the United States enable international comparisons.
Contribution
This paper is one of the first that analyses the (cash) payment behavior of consumers using
harmonized micro data from several countries. Due to the lack of available data, relatively little
has been known about cash usage; we provide some evidence. Combining data from regular
questionnaires with data from payment diaries that collect information on individual payments
of consumers allows us to comprehensively analyze the payment behavior of consumers. One of
the contributions of this paper is the harmonization of the datasets from the different countries,
which is a pre-requisite for the international comparison.
Results
Many have predicted that cash is disappearing as a payment instrument. This paper shows,
however, that in all seven countries considered, cash is still used extensively; in particular for
low-value transactions. In Austria and Germany, the cash share dominates in terms of value of
transactions. Apart from transaction sizes and consumer preferences for ease of use, the use of
cash is strongly correlated with demographics and point-of-sale characteristics such as merchant
card acceptance and venue. We show that these results are not specific to a particular country,
but instead affect cash usage across the seven countries considered. Our paper does signal
important cross-country differences. First, the level of cash usage differs across countries. Also,
differences can be found in terms of the type of alternatives used for cash (credit cards vs. debit
cards). One explanation for these cross-country differences could be found in differences in
market structures and the pricing policies of retail payments.

1 Introduction
During the past several decades, payment systems worldwide have become increasingly elec-
tronic, transformed by innovations in financial markets and information technology ­ even in
less-developed countries that rely heavily on mobile phones; see Jack, Suri, and Townsend
(2010) for a discussion of Kenya. Now, these electronic innovations have spread to private vir-
tual currencies, such as Bitcoin; see European Central Bank (2012) and Velde (2013). During
this breathtaking transformation, relatively little research has been done comparing payment
systems in different countries since the seminal work of Humphrey, Pulley, and Vesala (1996).
In the rare instances where comprehensive data are available for comparison, usually cash is ex-
cluded; see the studies by Bolt, Humphrey, and Uittenbogaard (2008) and the Federal Reserve
System (2013). However, new research is revealing the emergence of an ironic consensus:
during the transformation of payments from paper to electronics, cash holding and use have
not disappeared.1
Figure 1 depicts the surprising resilience of cash in the 21st century for a select group of
industrial countries. In most of these countries, the ratios of currency in circulation (CIC)
relative to nominal GDP generally declined at least through the 1980s or even early 1990s.
Since then, however, these ratios have stayed flat or even increased. Likely, the CIC ratios
for the United States (US) and the euro area (euro) have increased considerably because of
strong foreign demand for the dollar and the euro; see Fischer, K¨
ohler, and Seitz (2004) and
Judson (2012). However, even the estimated domestic U.S. currency ratio has increased since
2000 and its behaviour is similar to that of the ratios in the other non-euro countries.2 The
econometric evidence in Briglevics and Schuh (2013b) suggests that some of the recent U.S.
increase may be the result of a decline in short-term interest rates to nearly zero. Nevertheless,
persistent holding and use of cash in these industrial countries during the spread of electronic
alternatives highlights a dire need for an updated comparative study of payments that includes
1Examples include Amromin and Chakravorti (2009), Lippi and Secchi (2009), and Evans, Webster, Colgan,
and Murray (2013).
2The domestic currency ratio could still be driven by domestic hoarding. One indicator of transaction demand
is given by the ratio of medium-denomination bank notes to nominal GDP. Judson (2012) shows that the respective
ratio for $20 decreased by half for the United States and Canada since the 1970s but has remained fairly stable
over the past 10 years.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
the use of cash. Furthermore, evidence on consumer holding and use of cash is even rarer.3
This paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature by comparing the payment choices of
consumers in the seven industrial countries portrayed in Figure 1 using a unique and grow-
ing data source.4 The data are collected from large-scale payment diary surveys conducted
in Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Canada (CA), France (FR), Germany (DE), the Netherlands
(NL), and the United States (US).5 Consumer payment diaries, which trace back at least to
Boeschoten and Fase (1989) and Boeschoten (1992), feature rich information on individual
payments collected over a fixed number of days paired with information on the detailed char-
acteristics of individual consumers.6 Payment diaries require consumers to record their trans-
actions, so they should provide more accurate data than surveys, which rely on consumer recall.
The current paper offers two contributions relative to previous work: (1) a careful, thorough
harmonization and analysis of these international diary data; and (2) a relatively simple econo-
metric analysis of consumers' use of cash versus non-cash payment instruments that employs
the microeconomic data from the payment diaries. We also provide a comprehensive review
of other research that has used payment diary micro data and assess opportunities for future
research that could use or develop diary data.
As with most international data, harmonization is essential to be able to make valid and
useful cross-country comparisons.7 Although the diary surveys are similar across countries,
direct comparisons of their respective statistics cannot be made without meticulous analysis
and adjustment of the technical details of the diary survey design and concept definitions.
Seemingly minor details, such as the inclusion of recurring bill payments (or not), can have
substantial effects on the resulting statistics. Therefore, we have harmonized the underlying
3An early U.S. example is the Survey of Currency and Transactions Account Usage described in Avery, El-
liehausen, Kennickell, and Spindt (1986).
4Jonker, Kosse, and Hern´
andez (2012) and Arango, Bouhdaoui, Bounie, Eschelbach, and Hern´
andez (2013)
provide complementary comparisons of subsets of these seven countries.
5The payment diaries from these seven countries do not form an exhaustive list of international sources of con-
sumer payments data. Other sources include Tak´
acs (2011), UK Payments Council (2013), and Danish National
Bank (2013).
6The Austrian National Bank has the longest history of successive diaries in 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2011
starting with Mooslechner and Wehinger (1997).
7The efforts to harmonize consumer payment diaries were inspired by international initiatives such as: the
Penn-World Tables (Summers and Heston, 1991), International Trade and Foreign Direct Investment (Feenstra,
Lipsey, Branstetter, Foley, Harrigan, Jensen, Kletzer, Mann, Schott, and Wright, 2010), or the ECB wealth survey
project (Household Finance and Consumption Survey, 2009).
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
data sources and results from the seven individual country diaries so that the reported figures
are comparable. In addition, we have harmonized the definition of socio-demographic variables
and point-of-sale (POS) characteristics (e.g., card acceptance and the spending location), which
permits a disaggregated view of payment behaviour. As a result, the statistics reported in this
paper may not coincide exactly with analogous data from national statistics. One factor that
cannot be harmonized, however, is the supply of services and providers across the national
payment systems. For example, paper cheques still are relatively common in France and the
United States but not in the other countries. Primarily for this reason, we do not attempt to
model specific non-cash payment instruments in each country.
Using the harmonized data, we shed light on two empirical issues. First, we demonstrate
the extent of consumer cash holding and use in each of the seven economies. Second, the micro
data allows us to discover who uses cash, for which purchases, at which locations, and for what
value of payment. These data may help us determine why cash is used and whether or not it is
likely to continue to be used in the future.
Our econometric analysis of consumer cash use follows in the tradition of the recent liter-
ature that seeks to understand the determinants of consumer payment behaviour more broadly.
This literature extends back at least to Stavins (2001), who estimated the effects of consumer
characteristics such as age, education, and income on consumer use of payment instruments
and certain banking practices. More recent papers on this subject, such as Borzekowski, Kiser,
and Shaista (2008), Ching and Hayashi (2010), Schuh and Stavins (2010), Arango, Huynh, and
Sabetti (2011), or von Kalckreuth, Schmidt, and Stix (2014b), inter alia, add a variety of other
explanatory variables to such regressions. Unlike most studies, which use data usually from
one country or only a few countries, this harmonized diary database makes it possible to assess
the extent to which the determinants of payment choice are specific to a particular country or
are more general in nature.8
Although our econometric analysis is a simple first step toward what ultimately can be done
with the diary data, it nevertheless generates a few notable results. In the logit estimation of
8We do not attempt to estimate models of consumer demand for cash, which is the subject of another closely-
related branch of the literature including Daniels and Murphy (1994), Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (2000), Attana-
sio, Guiso, and Jappelli (2002), Bounie and Francois (2008), Lippi and Secchi (2009), and Briglevics and Schuh
(2013b). These studies rely on consumer surveys, rather than diaries, to collect cash-related data on consumers,
and generally do not attempt to estimate consumer demand for other payment instruments.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
cash versus non-cash use, we find a surprising degree of similarity in the significant marginal
effects of determinants of payment use across countries, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
Not surprisingly, the similarity is stronger for consumer payments made at grocery stores,
which presumably are relatively homogeneous payment opportunities across countries in terms
of goods, transaction sizes, and merchant acceptance of payments. Much more econometric
modeling could be done with this harmonized diary database. In the penultimate section of this
paper, we survey other research that has already used various forms of this diary data to study
consumer payment choice in other contexts.
Using comprehensive, cross-country information on cash usage to develop a more refined
understanding of consumer payment choices is important for policy-makers and academics
alike. In recent years, regulation of credit card and debit card interchange fees has come to the
forefront in a number of countries. Better insight into consumer behaviour is essential for the
determination and evaluation of these regulations. The study of cash demand and management
also is important for evaluation of the cost of payments,9 seigniorage revenue, central bank
management of currency stocks, and the welfare costs of inflation. The use of payment instru-
ments to access bank accounts is important for understanding bank supervision and regulation,
and may provide insights into consumer welfare associated with liquid asset management. In
the final section of this paper, we analyse the applicability of the consumer payment diary data
to some frontier theoretical models in these areas. The breadth and importance of all of these
topics underscore the puzzling deficiency of statistical evidence on cash use by consumers, and
the importance of this new resource for future research.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents salient aggregate results regarding
the payment behaviour in the seven countries, which provide a foundation for the subsequent
analysis. Section 3 describes the payment diaries and steps taken to harmonize the database.
Section 4 presents the consumer expenditure patterns across countries. Section 5 discusses the
various factors that may affect the levels of cash usage across countries. Section 6 presents the
estimation results for the econometric models of consumer choice between the use of cash ver-
sus non-cash payment instruments. Section 7 reviews the existing research that uses consumer
payment diary data. Section 8 assesses the value of the diary data for a selected subset of the

literature in a few fields to which the diary data are particularly well-suited for econometric
application, and notes how diary data need to develop, improve, and expand to be useful to a
wider variety of theoretical applications. Section 9 concludes.
2 Salient Results
Table 1 distills our findings concerning the payment structure in each of the seven countries.
Although the harmonization of the data sources will be discussed in more detail in Section 3,
at this point we note that the presented figures include basically all personal payments of re-
spondents made either at a POS, for remote purchases, or in-person to other persons. Recurrent
transactions (e.g., rent, utility bills) are excluded. Our main findings follow:
· Between 46% and 82% of the number of all payment transactions are conducted by cash.
· In value terms, differences across countries are accentuated. For AT and DE, cash dom-
inates (more than 50%); in CA, FR and US, cash payments account for only about one-
fourth of the value of transactions.
· The composition of non-cash payments varies substantially across countries. For AU,
CA, and US, credit cards are more important, while they are of only minor relevance for
the European countries considered, where debit cards are the chief electronic means of
payment. Cheques remain an important payment instrument for FR and are a component
of the other category for US alongside prepaid cards.
· The overwhelming fraction of payments is conducted with only a few payment instru-
ments: the accumulated cash, debit and credit share greater than 95% for AU, AT, CA,
DE and NL, and greater than 88% for FR and US.
The major question that emerges from these findings is how the levels of cash use in the
various countries can be explained. As a first attempt, Table 1 summarizes information on three
indicators about market structure. The results show the following:
· Payment card ownership (especially debit card ownership) is high in all countries. How-
ever, there are large cross-country differences with respect to the dissemination of credit
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
cards. This suggests that the use of cash may be correlated with the level of card owner-
ship.
· Another indication about market structure can be obtained from average transaction val-
ues. In all seven countries, the average value of cash transactions is lower than the av-
erage value of card transactions. This result is consistent with prevalent transaction-size
models (i.e., Whitesell, 1989; Bouhdaoui and Bounie, 2012). Notably, in card-intensive
countries, the average card transaction value is lower than it is in cash-intensive coun-
tries.
· The acceptance of payment cards by merchants differs across countries. There is limited
evidence from the surveys, but available evidence for AT, CA, and DE indicates there is
a correlation with cash usage.
· Survey responses suggest that cash balances are substantially higher for AT and DE than
for the other countries. This result corresponds with the importance of cash for payments
in these countries. This correlation may not be causal and there may be a simultaneity in
cash management and payment behaviour. For example, the level of cash balances might
affect consumers' use of cash, but similarly, the use of cash may also be a determinant
of the amount of cash consumers carry.
We will use the above findings to delve deeper into the levels in cash use across countries.
To get a better grasp, we will also analyse cash use by looking at (1) the expenditure struc-
ture in the various countries, (2) whether cash usage differs across transaction types and POS
characteristics (transaction value, type of expenditure, acceptance) and (3) whether the use of
cash varies across socio-demographic factors. Similarly, we (4) further assess the interrelation
between cash holdings and payment behaviour by delving deeper into cash management prac-
tices of consumers. As a case in point, Table 1 highlights that all "non-cash-intensive" countries
have a rather similar median cash balance, or about 30 purchasing-power parity (PPP)-USD.
This suggests that consumers behave rather similarly in different countries. We will further ex-
emplify and analyse this issue by looking at withdrawals and other aspects of cash management
behaviour.

3 Consumer Payment Diaries ­ Validity and Harmonization
This section provides a short overview of the methodological features and key survey out-
comes of the payment diaries included in the cross-country comparison. We will start with
a more general discussion about the value of payment diary data, by contrasting diary stud-
ies with classical ways of collecting information, such as questionnaire surveys or macro-data
analyses. The section concludes with a few remarks on the harmonization steps necessary to
create comparable data sets.
3.1 Consumer payment diaries
Several types of data can be used to assess consumers' use of payment instruments. First, offi-
cial transaction records of banks, card processors, or retailers can be employed. The advantage
of these data is that they are based on observed behaviour and they provide a good basis for
examining aggregate changes in payment use over time. However, often such data do not al-
low for an in-depth analysis of behaviour at the consumer level. Some data are proprietary,
so individual behaviour cannot be tracked. Scanner data do not usually provide info about
the consumer and are focused on only a certain portion of consumer behaviour (e.g., grocery
purchases).
Therefore, payment studies often have recourse to consumer survey data. Here a distinc-
tion can be made between data collected through consumer questionnaires versus data col-
lected through consumer payment diaries. The advantage of questionnaires is that the burden
on the respondent is limited to the time needed for completing the questionnaire at one mo-
ment in time; diaries, in contrast, require respondents to report information over a number of
days. While this collection method generates data that allow for thorough analyses of gen-
eral behavioural patterns as well as the underlying drivers, it is less suitable for analysing the
specificities of individual payments. For example, surveys may serve as a valuable tool for
measuring the adoption of payment instruments by consumers, while diaries are better for as-
sessing their actual use.10
10In particular, when asking about individual payments, questionnaires may suffer from "recall bias" or under-
reporting of payments due to incomplete recall. Frequent and low-value payments are especially sensitive to being
omitted; see Jonker and Kosse (2013).
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
Collecting payment data through diaries has thus become popular in recent years.11 The
main benefits of using diary data, in particular in combination with questionnaire data, are ob-
vious. Foremost, as consumers are stimulated to record with a minimum of delay after each
particular transaction, the probability of transactions being omitted or erroneously reported is
lower than for questionnaire surveys. Payment diaries also allow for the collection of many
details of individual transactions, such as the payment amount, the payment location, the ac-
ceptance of non-cash payments, and surcharging, which enable better understanding of the
factors that drive consumer heterogeneity in payment behaviour.
Insofar as payment diaries record cash balances over time, they also allow for an exami-
nation of the interaction between payment choice and cash management. When conducted for
several days, a temporal sequence of actual payments and cash withdrawals can be created,
which is useful for understanding within-consumer heterogeneities in payment instruments us-
age.
3.2 Validity of seven payment diaries
Our study uses payment diaries that were conducted independently in each country and hence
were not harmonized. Differences pertain to the number of recorded days (from one to eight
days), the mode of data collection (paper versus online), the scope of transactions covered (e.g.,
recurrent and remote transactions), and the level of detail regarding transaction characteristics
(Table 2).12 To account for these differences, we put a lot of effort into the harmonization of the
variables and concepts, and we are confident that the level of comparability is high enough to
conduct our cross-country analysis. The next subsections discuss similarities and differences
as well as the harmonization steps undertaken.
Despite the advantages of diary surveys described above, the question arises as to the rep-
resentativeness of recorded transactions. Under-reporting is one issue, as illegal transactions
and transactions in the realm of the shadow economy will likely not be covered. But even for
11Collecting data using diaries has a long history in official statistics on expenditure; see McWhinney and
Champion (1974). Earlier general surveys about payments were conducted by Avery, Elliehausen, Kennickell,
and Spindt (1986) and Boeschoten (1992). Mooslechner and Wehinger (1997) conducted a payment diary in
Austria in 1996.
12The literature has shown that the specific design of a diary may affect the quality of the collected data; e.g.,
Crossley and Winter (2012), Jonker and Kosse (2013), Sudman and Ferber (1971).
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
everyday expenditures, we do not know how well respondents record their transactions.
To ensure the efficacy of the seven payment diaries, we compare the diary outcomes to
aggregate expenditure data from national accounts statistics. For this reason, we extrapolate
the survey outcomes by multiplying the average daily diary expenditure by 365 to obtain an
annual figure. This value is compared with the average annual value of expenses as reported by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), deducting expenses
for housing, water, electricity, and gas.13
The results of this exercise are reported in the last row of Table 2. For all diaries, the ratio of
the extrapolated diary outcomes to the aggregate OECD POS consumption figures ranges from
0.72 to 1.16. Note that certain deviations are to be expected, as both the diary data and the data
provided by the OECD are based on sampling-based survey estimates, and, hence, are subject
to a certain degree of error. Also, due to differences in classifications, the diaries and national
account figures are likely to differ regarding the sectors and types of payment included.
Therefore, we interpret the ratios, which all vary around 1.00, as evidence that all indi-
vidual surveys perform rather well in capturing the actual expenses made in these countries.
Moreover, all countries undertook a number of plausibility checks. These comprised either
comparison with population figures (if available; e.g., the average number and value of debit
card payments or ATM withdrawals) or with other sources (such as other market research re-
ports). Some countries could refer to earlier payment diary or questionnaire studies and check
their stability over time.
3.3 Similarities
The seven diary surveys share a number of similarities (see Table 2). First, all seven diaries
collect data on POS transactions. Each diary attempts to record non-business-related personal
expenditures of the respondent (whether for the respondent or for other people). Second, the
information collected for each transaction is similar. All respondents were asked to record:
(1) the date (and sometimes even the time), (2) the transaction value, (3) the payment instru-
ment used, and (4) the merchant's sector where the purchase occurred. AT, CA, DE, and NL
13We focus on the average annual expenses by the adult population only, since the samples used in the diary
surveys also only targeted residents aged between 18 and 75 years.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
respondents were asked to assess whether the purchase could have been paid using payment
instruments other than the one actually used. For cash withdrawals, all diaries collected in-
formation on the location (and in some cases the timing) as well as on the amount of the
withdrawal. Each diary furthermore contained questions on consumers' cash balances either
before the first recorded transaction or for their typical average cash holdings.
Third, the seven diary studies are similar in that they were all conducted at the end of the
year, i.e., between September and November. The fieldwork was conducted in 2009 (CA),
2010 (AU), 2011 (AT, FR, DE, and NL), and 2012 (US).
Fourth, the seven diaries are similar with respect to the population being surveyed. Most
targeted residents were aged between 18 and 75 years, although some diaries were also dis-
tributed among children and people aged over 75 years. However, as discussed above in the
expenditure ratio, all the analyses presented in this paper focus only on the payments made by
adults. Finally, all diary surveys yielded data sets containing more than 10,000 transactions.
3.4 Differences
Several differences among the diaries should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.
First, some diaries asked respondents to fill out the diary using paper and pencil (AU, AT, DE,
and FR). US and CA relied on a mix of paper and online questionnaires. For NL, information
was collected via an online tool or by phone, if desired. Also, a difference relates to the selec-
tion of respondents. Most countries used random stratified or clustered sampling techniques,
but they differed with respect to the frame from which the respondents were selected. For
CA, NL, and US, for instance, respondents were randomly selected from an existing panel of
consumers who regularly participate in surveys.
Online data-collection methods and online panels may be sensitive to biases when partic-
ular population groups are excluded from participation because of not having access to the
Internet, and when the persons who do participate behave differently than those who do not;
see Bethlehem (2008). Yet, given the high Internet penetration for CA, NL, and US, the poten-
tial biases caused by the use of online methods and online panels can be expected to be limited.
Jonker and Kosse (2013) demonstrate for NL that drawing respondents from an online panel
does not introduce pro-electronic biases reflected in an overestimation of card usage. More-
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
over, in order to prevent any such biases, all panellists for US were provided with a computer
or with Internet access.
Second, differences exist with respect to the length of the diaries, as follows: 1-day (NL),
3-day (CA, US), 7-day (AT, AU, and DE), and 8-day (FR). Research by Ahmed, Brzozowski,
and Crossley (2006), Jonker and Kosse (2013), and McWhinney and Champion (1974) shows
that longer diaries may lead to survey fatigue (i.e., under-reporting of expenditures), especially
for small-value transactions.14 Despite these differences and their potential consequences, we
believe that, due to their richness, the seven data sets are well suited for answering the main
questions of this paper. Moreover, as will be discussed below, we conducted some robustness
checks that confirmed that the differences in diary length do not sizably affect our overall
findings and conclusions.
3.5 Harmonization
We undertook the following harmonization steps to create seven data sets that are mutually
comparable. In particular:
1. We distilled all payments from persons aged 18 years and older.
2. We only consider the payments made at the POS; for remote purchases via mail or-
der, the telephone, or the Internet; and in-person person-to-person payments. Recurrent
transactions (e.g., rents, utility bills) are excluded.
Also, we conducted a number of harmonization steps with respect to the reported results
on card acceptance at the POS, consumer preferences, and type of purchases made. The results
with respect to the type of purchases, however, should only be taken as a rough indicator,
due to the large national differences in the number and size of categories used.15 Finally,
14 Ahmed, Brzozowski, and Crossley (2006), Jonker and Kosse (2013), and Schmidt (2011) study the effect of
survey fatigue and the efficacy of data collection via payment diaries.
15Harmonization difficulties arose mainly because of (1) national differences in how the information was col-
lected (from only a few broad categories of sectors in some countries to very detailed lists in other countries); (2)
differences in the categorization of expenditures (e.g., some countries recorded expenditures in restaurants and
hotels in one category; other countries recorded hotel expenditures with other services) and (3) differences in the
structure of retail shops (e.g., in some countries newspapers and tobacco can be bought in grocery shops; other
countries have small special shops for these expenditures).
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
we harmonized the definitions and categories of the various socio-demographic characteristics
(e.g., income, education).
4 Expenditure Patterns
Table 3 reports summary statistics of the total structure of recorded payments and thereby of
expenditures of consumers.16 It shows that the structure of payments is very similar across
countries with respect to the time of day, day of the week and payment channel. About one-
third of transactions are conducted before noon, and two-thirds after. As expected, Sunday is
the day with the lowest share of transactions, although some cross-country differences are dis-
cernible. For example, the Sunday share is slightly higher for AU and US, which is reasonable
given cultural differences in store opening hours. Finally, in-person transactions make up the
vast majority of payments. For AU and US, Internet/mobile payments at the POS account for
a volume share that is higher than 4%, while in all other countries it is almost negligible.
With respect to the type of purchase or the sectoral composition, keeping the harmonization
difficulties in mind, we find that groceries account for the majority of transactions in all coun-
tries (except for US). The share of grocery expenditures is quite similar for AT, FR, DE, and
NL. Also, the gas station expenditure share, which arguably constitutes the most homogeneous
type of expenditures, is similar across countries. Thus, taken together, these results provide
evidence that shopping patterns are relatively similar across the seven countries.
More importantly, the diaries are also informative regarding other payment characteristics
about which relatively little is known, at least in a comparative perspective. This brings us to
our first fact:
Fact 1 The structure of consumer payments is rather similar across countries with respect to
the number and the value of transactions: (1) Consumers conduct only a few payment transac-
tions per day and (2) most consumer expenditures are relatively small in value.
The mean number of transactions per person per day (PPD) varies from 1.4 to 2.1 transac-
tions across countries. The median person, who arguably is more robust to outliers, conducts
16Note that these are consumer expenditures and not consumption.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
only 1.3 transactions for CA, FR, DE, and US, and 1.4 transactions for AT. The median amount
spent PPD varies across countries, ranging from 20 to 41 PPP-USD.
Analysing individual transactions provides another angle from which to view the data.
Table 3 reports the quartiles of transaction values. This analysis shows that the median trans-
action amount is around 12 PPP-USD for AU, CA, FR, and NL. For AT, DE, and US, the value
is higher, at 17 to 22 PPP-USD. We also find that 75% of all recorded transactions are lower
than 25 to 40 PPP-USD.
5 Cash Usage: Descriptive Evidence
Table 1 documented the outstanding importance of cash in all countries. In this section, we
focus on the use of cash in terms of: transaction size, cash balances, socio-demographics (in-
come, education, age, and consumer preferences), cash card ownership, and POS characteris-
tics (acceptance of payment cards and type of economic activity). The selection of these factors
rests on previous literature that has mostly been confined to the analysis of single countries.17
Note that the descriptive statistics presented in this section provide only a first indication of the
potential correlation with cash usage, disregarding all other factors. A final answer on the role
of each of the selected factors in explaining consumers' cash usage can only be provided after
controlling for the other variables using multivariate econometric estimations. These estimates
are completed in Section 6.
5.1 Transaction size
Numerous previous papers have shown that transaction size is highly correlated with the choice
of payment instruments (e.g., Arango, Huynh, and Sabetti, 2011; Bouhdaoui and Bounie, 2012;
Klee, 2008; von Kalckreuth, Schmidt, and Stix, 2014a). Our analysis substantiates these find-
ings.
Fact 2 The use of cash decreases with transaction size. In all countries, cash is predominant
for the smallest 50% of transactions. For the largest 25% of transactions, the use of payment
17One shortcoming of our analysis is that our data cannot establish the causal link between payment choice and
card pricing (e.g., Borzekowski, Kiser, and Shaista, 2008; Simon, Smith, and West, 2010). Moreover, whenever
we analyse POS characteristics, we assume that these are fixed.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
instruments is very heterogeneous across countries.
Figure 2 depicts the payment instrument shares for cash, debit, credit, and other payment
instruments for each transaction value quartile. This figure confirms the dominance of cash
for low transaction values in all countries. In the first transaction value quartile, debit plays
only a minor role for CA, NL, and US, while credit is used only for CA (share of 3%) and US
(share of 6%). Other payment instruments have a notable share for low-value transactions only
for NL (14%) and US (6%). For all countries, we find that the cash share is higher than 50%
up to the median transaction value. In the third quartile, the dominance of cash fades. In this
transaction value range, however, cash has a higher share than debit or credit in three countries
and a share that is about equal to the share of debit for CA, FR, NL, and US. In the fourth
quartile, the full heterogeneity across countries becomes evident: (1) the importance of credit
card payments for AU, CA, and US, (2) the importance of cheques for FR and US, and (3) the
relative importance of debit versus credit in all European countries.
5.2 Cash balances
Withdrawal innovations such as ATM terminals have affected the demand for cash. For in-
stance, Alvarez and Lippi (2013b) show that free and random withdrawal opportunities can
give rise to a precautionary motive for holding cash, meaning that agents withdraw cash even if
they have some cash on hand. Several empirical studies suggest that higher cash holdings are
correlated with higher use of cash in payments; see Arango, Huynh, and Sabetti (2011), Es-
chelbach and Schmidt (2013), Bouhdaoui and Bounie (2012), and Arango, Bouhdaoui, Bounie,
Eschelbach, and Hern´
andez (2013). Our findings provide support for a relationship between
cash usage and cash balances.
Fact 3 Austria and Germany, relative to other countries, are cash-intensive, with large cash
balances and large average withdrawal amounts.
Table 4 reports statistics on individuals' cash management patterns. The average cash
balances (M) for AT (148 USD) and DE (123 USD) are two-times greater than those in other
countries (from 51 for NL to 74 USD for US). These statistics are in line with the greater use of
cash in payments for AT and DE, where the share of cash by volume exceeds 80%. It reaches a
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
maximum of just 65% in other countries. As a consequence, the mean of the ratio M/e, where
e denotes daily expenditure, varies from 1.5 for AU to 4.8 for AT. The gaps between countries
persist even if we abstract from extreme values: the median equals 0.6 for US, while it reaches
3.4 for AT. The extent to which the suggested relationship between cash balances and cash
usage is causal remains unclear. That is, the level of cash balances might affect consumers' use
of cash, but, similarly, the use of cash may determine the amount of cash that consumers carry.
Hence, it is not clear whether cash management causes cash usage or vice versa.
Cash is obtained from ATMs, bank tellers, and other sources (family, cashbacks, etc.).
Except for US, the main source of cash is the ATM; the share of people withdrawing at least
once a month from ATMs exceeds 70% in all countries. However, the median number of
monthly ATM withdrawals greatly varies across countries, from 2 for DE to 4 for CA and
AT. These withdrawal patterns seem to be directly correlated with the typical cash withdrawal
amounts at ATMs.18
The overall picture that emerges from these figures is that respondents in cash-intensive
economies do not economize on cash balances by withdrawing more often. Instead, it seems
that they prefer to hold higher cash balances. There are several possible reasons for this be-
haviour. One is that AT and DE respondents hold larger cash balances because of the risk that
lumpy purchases can only be conducted in cash (Alvarez and Lippi, 2013b). This would imply
that precautionary balances are higher in these two countries than in other countries. However,
the evidence is not conclusive. Cash balances at withdrawals are larger for AT and DE than for
CA but not larger than for US.
These descriptive statistics can be further exploited to examine the empirical performance
of the Baumol (1952) and Tobin (1956) model on cash management. Following Alvarez and
Lippi (2009), two statistics are worth discussing. The first is the ratio between cash holdings
at the time of a withdrawal (M) and average/median currency holdings (M). This statistic
provides a measure of precautionary balances. While this ratio is zero in the Baumol-Tobin
model, its median in the data ranges from 0.2 for CA to 0.5 for US.
18As previously outlined, US stands out in this respect: the share of people obtaining cash from other sources
at least once a month (90%) is above that of ATMs and tellers (70% and 40%, respectively), and the withdrawal
frequency at these other sources is far above that for ATMs and tellers (3.3 compared to 1.3 for ATMs and 0.7 for
tellers).
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
The second interesting statistic is the ratio between the withdrawal amount (W) and the
average currency holdings (W/M). This ratio equals 2 in the Baumol-Tobin model. The mean
of this ratio is substantially higher in the data (from 3.8 for CA to 16 for DE), but if we take the
median to eliminate extreme cash withdrawal values, the ratio is relatively close to 2 in most
cases. These results suggest a precautionary motive for holding cash. To draw any structural
interpretation, however, more work is required.
5.3 Socio-demographic characteristics
This section presents evidence on cash usage along socio-demographics characteristics and we
inquire into consumers' preferences by analysing survey evidence on perceptions of cash.
Fact 4 Cash usage decreases with education and income, but varies across age categories.
5.3.1 Age, income, and education
The role of age is of interest because one could argue that the enduring importance of cash
could be due to habit persistence. Indeed, previous literature indicates that older people hold
and use more cash while young consumers are more likely to use new payment technologies
(e.g., Daniels and Murphy, 1994; Boeschoten, 1998; Carow and Staten, 1999; Stavins, 2001;
Hayashi and Klee, 2003).
Our results in Figure 3 reveal that "older" people use significantly more cash than younger
people except for US, where younger individuals use more cash than older individuals. Note
again that these descriptive statistics assume all other factors to be fixed. These figures regard-
ing age do not control for differences in expenditure patterns or other personal characteristics;
for example, younger consumers may buy different products and/or services and at different
venues than older individuals. Therefore, a final answer on the role of age can only be given
with estimations that control for these other variables, which will be the focus of the next
section.19
Income and education have been cited in the literature as important factors, with cash usage
declining with higher income and education (e.g., for CA Arango, Huynh, and Sabetti (2011);
19von Kalckreuth, Schmidt, and Stix (2014a) find no evidence in favour of strong habit persistence. Instead,
they attribute higher cash usage of older people to their differential characteristics (e.g., lower opportunity costs
of time or lower income).
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
for DE von Kalckreuth, Schmidt, and Stix (2014b); and for US Schuh and Stavins (2010);
Cohen and Rysman (2013). Figure 3 confirms differences along income terciles with less cash
usage by higher-income respondents. Even stronger differences are found along education.
Notably, these differences pertain to all analysed countries: for DE and CA, the difference in
the value share of cash between low education and high education is more than 26 percentage
points, while in the remaining countries this difference ranges from 9 to 18 percentage points.20
Recent work by von Kalckreuth, Schmidt, and Stix (2014a) finds that cash is used to mon-
itor expenditures. In particular, their prediction is that cash will be used for this purpose by
individuals who face financial constraints and who have difficulties with other monitoring tech-
niques (such as online accounts). The pattern of results obtained for income and education is
in line with this proposition.21
5.3.2 Consumer preferences
One could argue that consumers are using cash because they have no choice; e.g., because
payment cards are not accepted or for reasons of costs, safety, or convenience. We can analyse
this issue by looking at consumers' ratings of certain payment instrument attributes, which
can be viewed as broad proxies for consumer preferences and which have been found to affect
payment choice (e.g., Borzekowski, Kiser, and Shaista, 2008; Ching and Hayashi, 2010; Schuh
and Stavins, 2010; Arango, Huynh, and Sabetti, 2011).
To a varying degree, the seven diaries contain information on preferences that we have
attempted to harmonize. The harmonization was difficult because the different diary surveys
described and asked about preferences in different ways. Moreover, responses were measured
in different ways, with some countries using Likert scales and others binary responses. In the
face of these obstacles, we were able to successfully harmonize only responses concerning
the relative perceived acceptance, cost, and ease-of-use of cash. Figure 4 shows a normalized
comparison of consumers' ratings of cash versus debit.22 The depicted measures are scale free,
20In many respects, these findings mirror the pattern observed for card ownership, which tends to vary along
the same socio-demographic lines (Table 6). However, the case of NL, where debit card ownership does not vary
across income or education while the cash shares do, suggests that income and education exert an autonomous
effect on cash usage that is independent of card ownership.
21The role of debit cards for spending restraint has been recently analysed by Fusaro (2013).
22See Arango, Huynh, and Sabetti (2011) and Jonker (2007) for a description of the normalization. Variables
are defined in Table A.1.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
with a positive (negative) value implying that cash is rated better (worse) than debit (a value of
zero means that cash is rated the same as debit). Similarly, we show results of a comparison of
cash with credit and of debit with credit.
Fact 5 Cash is generally valued by consumers for its perceived acceptance, costs, and ease of
use.
Concerning consumer perceptions of acceptance, we can compare results from five coun-
tries. For AT, CA, and DE, cash is rated higher than debit. For US, cash is rated the same as
debit, and for NL cash is rated worse than debit. For CA and US, we find that results con-
cerning cash versus debit and cash versus credit are very similar, mirroring that both cards are
perceived to have a similar acceptance. In the other countries, credit cards are seen as worse
than debit cards, corresponding with the authors' perception of the acceptance of credit cards
in countries such as AT, DE, and NL.
With respect to perceived cost, we find that cash is rated better than debit for AT, CA, DE,
and US, and for NL it is rated similarly. Again, the difference is more pronounced in favour of
cash when it comes to a comparison of cash to credit. Finally, regarding the ease of use, debit
is rated higher for AT, CA, and DE, while it is rated lower than cash for FR, NL, and US.
Overall, this evidence suggests that cash usage by consumers is not the sole result of a
lack of alternatives. To the contrary, cash is valued by consumers because it is perceived
more positively than, or as positively as, credit and debit cards with respect to cost. Also, the
assessment shows that in particular in countries with relatively high cash use, ease of use may
be an important driver.
5.4 Card ownership
Cash usage may be influenced by differences in the dissemination and use of payment cards.
Fact 6 Whereas the levels of card ownership differ across countries, overall card ownership is
rather high. Consumers only use a few payment instruments alongside cash.
Table 5 shows that in each country the vast majority of consumers hold payment cards: For
AT, with its high cash share, we observe the lowest card dissemination share of 86%. For NL,
virtually all consumers are in possession of a payment card.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
The most striking difference in card ownership can be seen in the dissemination of credit
cards. Table 6 presents disaggregated evidence on card ownership by socio-demographics,
showing that differences in credit card ownership prevail along all age, income, and educational
groups. These differences suggest that there are factors related to the market structure that
affect credit card dissemination.
There are significant differences in the number of cards owned or used (multi-homing).23
CA and US consumers possess, on average, 3.5 and 4.2 payment cards. For all other countries,
the respective value is below 2. The median number of payment cards is 3 for CA and US, 2
for AU and NL and only 1 for AT, DE, and FR.
Table 5 also presents evidence on the number of payment instruments used in the diary pe-
riod. Our findings indicate that the median consumer uses two payment instruments (including
cash) over the diary recording period.24 Although these results are influenced by the length of
the diary period, it suggests that the median consumer uses only a few payment instruments
alongside cash, which is in line with the results of Cohen and Rysman (2013) using a data set
that follows consumers over a much longer period of time.
5.5 POS characteristics
Finally, we discuss two types of POS characteristics: (1) card acceptance at the POS, and (2)
the type of economic activity in which transactions occur.
Fact 7 Higher usage of cash is associated with lower levels of card acceptance at the POS.
Fact 8 Cash usage varies across types of purchases and venues.
5.5.1 Card acceptance
The role of card acceptance at the POS can be approached by using direct survey evidence
for AT, CA, and DE. In particular, the respective payment diaries recorded whether a transac-
tion could have been made in cashless form. On the basis of this information, we can analyse
23Rysman (2007) discusses the issue of multi-homing (that is, respondents' practice of holding or using more
than one payment card). In our analysis, we focus on card use on the extensive margin (number of cards), not the
intensive margin (how much the card is used).
24For NL the median is one payment instrument, which is explained by the fact that respondents only recorded
their payments for one day.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
whether high cash usage is attributable to insufficient payment card acceptance. When in-
terpreting results, however, it should be kept in mind that they are based on the subjective
assessment of respondents.
Table 7, which tabulates the consumer's self-stated acceptance of cards at the POS by
transaction values, confirms that the acceptance of payment cards is much lower for small-
value amounts than for large-value amounts. For transaction values in the first quartile, DE
stands out with low acceptance. Furthermore, a comparison across countries indicates that (1)
CA has the highest acceptance values in each quartile, and (2) the difference, interestingly,
is not strong for higher transaction amounts relative to AT and DE. This evidence is roughly
consistent with cash usage. Note again that these descriptive statistics assume all other factors
to be fixed. Therefore, to analyse the real effect of card acceptance, econometric analyses will
be used in Section 6 to account for all other potential factors.
5.5.2 Type of purchase
The diaries allow the analysis of cash usage in different sectors/for different types of expendi-
tures. We have calculated payment instrument shares for cash, debit, and credit for all sectors,
summarized in Table 8. Given country-specific differences in industry sector definitions, we
stress that harmonization is incomplete, particularly for services and "other sectors," so results
should be taken with caution.
Cross-country differences in payment patterns across different sectors could be driven by
differences in transaction values, card acceptance, or behavioural patterns, or by cultural dif-
ferences. Accordingly, Figure 5 depicts three sectors that we consider interesting with regard
to these factors.
First, we suspect that card acceptance at gas stations is almost universal, or at least high in
all countries. At the same time, the typical expenditure value is roughly equal in size across
countries. This implies that an analysis of cash usage at gas stations should give an indication
of the role of acceptance and transaction sizes in explaining the levels of cash usage. That is,
if acceptance and transaction sizes were the only factors driving payment behaviour, we would
expect to find fairly equal levels of cash usage in gas stations across all countries. Indeed,
our results suggest that cross-country differences in cash usage are significantly smaller at gas
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
stations than for all expenditures. In particular, we find that the cash share at gas stations for AT
and DE drops significantly relative to the overall cash share. This provides a strong indication
of the effects of acceptance and transaction sizes. Despite this finding, we note that sizable
differences across countries still prevail, showing that acceptance and sizes are not the only
factors driving cash usage.
Second, expenditures at bars and fast food restaurants could be cash-intensive due to con-
venience. Indeed, the descriptive results show that the cash share for these transactions is
substantially higher than the overall cash share for all countries except FR, where cheques ac-
count for more than 40% of the expenditure value share in this sector. It is notable that this can
also be observed in countries that have a high card acceptance rate. Again, this result is an in-
dication that consumers differ in their payment behaviour depending on the spending location,
which is not only to be explained by levels of card acceptance and transaction sizes.
Third, for the grocery sector the cash expenditure share is higher than the average for
all countries except US. Interestingly, the debit share is higher for all countries except FR,
which has a slight increase in credit cards. We conjecture that this fact is associated with
convenience and/or the market structure of the grocery sector. Regarding the first issue, cash
could be considered a convenient and fast way to pay for purchases at (small) grocery stores.
It might also be correlated with the size of the location and card acceptance. In most European
countries, grocery stores are smaller than for AU, CA, and US. The grocery sector, often having
low margins, might focus on the cost of payments, which could explain the higher usage of
debit.
6 Choosing Cash versus Non-Cash
This section investigates the usage of cash versus non-cash in a multivariate setting. We esti-
mate the probability of choosing cash versus non-cash alternatives (either debit or credit) at the
POS using the following logit model:
U
j
= Xj
 + j
, where j = Cash, Non-Cash, (1)
where U
j
is the utility of choice j as a function of observables Xj
and a logit error j
. The
variables, Xj
, used in the regression are: (1) transaction size, (2) cash balances, (3) socio-
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
demographic characteristics (age, income, education), (4) consumer perceptions of ease of
use, acceptance, and cost, and (5) POS transaction characteristics (card acceptance and type of
purchase). Variables are defined in Table A.1. The sample contains all individuals (also those
without payment cards) and all transactions that are conducted using cash, debit, or credit.
The goal of these estimations is twofold. First, we would like to quantify which factors
exert an impact on consumers' choice of whether or not to pay in cash, even when controlling
for other potential factors. Second, we would like to study whether the use of cross-country
data reveals patterns that are common to all countries.
6.1 Results
Table 9 reports the marginal effects on the probability of using cash. Overall, the findings are
fairly consistent and highlight that demographics play a major role across countries. Even when
controlling for transaction size and other characteristics, we find that higher income and higher
education are associated with lower cash use. Regarding age, we find that persons older than
36 use significantly more cash than persons younger than 35. Also, the results provide support
for a certain habit persistence in some countries (AT, AU, DE, NL), where cash increases
homogeneously with age: people aged 60 and older are more likely to use cash than people
between 36 and 59.
For three countries that collected data on consumer perceptions regarding payment instru-
ments (AT, CA, and US), the perceived ease of using cash was highly significant and positive.
This shows that consumers who rate cash high with regard to ease of use conduct more cash
transactions. The perceptions regarding security were different, positive versus negative, be-
tween AT and CA. The other perceptions with respect to cost and overall acceptance were not
significant. These results are in line with previous research; see Schuh and Stavins (2010),
Arango, Huynh, and Sabetti (2011), and von Kalckreuth, Schmidt, and Stix (2014b).
The strongest effect on consumers' choice between cash and non-cash was obtained for
transaction values, where the estimation results confirm that the probability of using cash de-
creases homogeneously with the transaction value quartile. These results hold across all coun-
tries. In the fourth transaction value quartile, the probability of using cash is lower by 42 (NL)
to 63 pp (FR) relative to the first transaction value quartile.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
The results also confirm an independent effect of purchase location/type of purchase. For
expenditures at gas stations and for purchases of semi-durables, the marginal effects were uni-
versally negative (with the exception of NL), while for services, entertainment, and groceries
they were positive. These results confirm previous results that were based on data from single
countries (e.g., Klee, 2008; Cohen and Rysman, 2013).
Another finding of the logit model is that people who hold higher cash balances on average
use cash more often than people with lower cash balances. Note, however, that we treat this
as indicative only because of the likely presence of reverse causality.25 Although we tried to
alleviate this issue by using average cash balances of individuals and not cash balances before
each transaction, we are aware that this does not completely solve the problem. For deeper
analyses of this issue, we refer to Eschelbach and Schmidt (2013), Bouhdaoui and Bounie
(2012), and Arango, Bouhdaoui, Bounie, Eschelbach, and Hern´
andez (2013), who arrive at
similar findings even when accounting for the possible endogeneity of cash balances.
Several results from our descriptive analysis indicate that card acceptance is likely to be
important in consumers' choice between cash and non-cash. This result is reported in Table 9,
which shows that the rate of acceptance of cards at the POS has a significant negative effect on
the probability of using cash (results are only available for AT, CA, DE, and, with limitations,
NL). In order to understand the quantitative impact of this factor and to study by how much
it contributes to the level of cash usage across countries, we conduct a scenario analysis. In
particular, we compare the baseline probabilities, i.e., the observed frequencies from the data
with the hypothetical values obtained by assigning each person the maximum group acceptance
observed in the sample. Note that this does not necessarily mean that acceptance is raised to
one, because this would imply a far stretch from reality. Thus, the question we ask is by how
much cash usage would decline if acceptance were as high as it is for the income/age group
that reports the highest rate of acceptance.26
Figure 6 summarizes the results for the first and fourth transaction value (TV) quartile. For
TV Q1, the effect on payment choice is trivial for AT, DE, and NL, while for CA it is significant.
25Applying an instrumental variable approach that is common to all countries was impossible, because the
survey questionnaires differed too much across countries. Omitting cash balances from the regressions, however,
does not affect the other findings.
26This also implies that we do not expect country differences to vanish, as the maximum rate of acceptance can
still differ across countries. All other variables are evaluated at their means.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
There is an almost 10 percentage point increase in card usage for low-value transactions if
payment cards were universally accepted. However, at TV Q4 the effect is similar across
countries, as the probability of card payment increases relative to cash. This would imply that
Canadians are more likely to pay with cards at all transactions if cards are universally accepted.
High acceptance of cards will only increase card use for AT and DE when the transaction
values are high. For NL, the effect would be minimal, which indicates that current levels of
acceptance are already relatively high at all transaction quartiles. These results highlight that
country differences remain substantial.
6.2 Robustness: Groceries and gas
As one important robustness check, we focus on transactions completed at grocery stores and
gas stations only. The results are reported in Table 10. Focusing on these sectors reduces the
sample by about one-half to two-thirds. The results again confirm the roles of demographics
and transaction value. These results are consistent with the findings of Klee (2008), who use
scanner data from grocery stores, and Cohen and Rysman (2013), who use scanner data from
grocery stores and gas stations.27 In addition, we find that the results for the other variables
do not change; we still find an independent effect for preferences, cash on hand, and payment
location/type of product.
Finally, we perform two additional robustness checks. One, we estimate a logit using the
transactions conducted on the first day of each diary to compare with the Dutch payment diary,
which only collected data per respondent for one day. Two, we also generate estimates using
only the first three days for AU, AT, DE, and FR that are comparable to those for CA and US.
Neither of these modifications affects the main results.
7 Payment Diaries: Past and Present
The usage of consumer payment diaries to understand monetary and payment economics is in
the nascent stage. This section provides a brief summary of how payment diaries have been
27Klee (2008) focuses mainly on the value of time while controlling for census-tract averaged demographics.
Her analysis does not have individual demographics, perceptions, or acceptance of cards. Cohen and Rysman
(2013) analyse rich data on grocery purchases and are able to follow consumers over a longer time period. Their
paper highlights the role of the transaction size.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
used to understand (1) cash usage, (2) determinants of payment instrument choice, and (3) how
market structure may matter for payment choice.
7.1 Consumer cash usage
A key advantage of payment diaries is the proper accounting of cash payments relative to all
methods of payment. Stix (2004), Jonker and Kettenis (2007), and Bounie, Francois, and
Waelbroeck (2013) demonstrate that cash demand is affected by debit card usage for AU, NL,
and FR. For DE, credit cards are relatively interchangeable with debit cards for the usage
of cash; see von Kalckreuth, Schmidt, and Stix (2014a). Further work by von Kalckreuth,
Schmidt, and Stix (2014b) uses payment diary data for DE to show that cash is used as a method
to monitor expenditures (pocket-watching). Fung, Huynh, and Sabetti (2012) investigate the
effect of retail payment innovations (i.e., contactless credit cards and stored-value cards) on
cash usage and find that there is a reduction. Finally, Bounie, Francois, and Waelbroeck (2013)
and Huynh, Schmidt-Dengler, and Stix (2014) study the impact of card acceptance on cash
usage. They find that the lack of card acceptance is a reason for precautionary cash balances.
7.2 Consumer adoption and use of payment instruments
The study by Bounie and Francois (2006), based on a 2005 French payment diary, was an early
attempt to disentangle the effect of demographics from the effect of payment characteristics
such as transaction value on payment choice. Further work by Bouhdaoui and Bounie (2012)
proposes a cash holding model as an alternative to a transaction-size explanation for payment
choice.28 Kosse (2013) focuses on the perception of safety aspects for cash versus debit, while
Kosse and Jansen (2013) demonstrate that a variation in demographics such as foreign back-
ground has a strong effect on payment choice for NL.
Simon, Smith, and West (2010) (for AU), Arango, Huynh, and Sabetti (2011) (for CA) and
Wakamori and Welte (2012) (for CA) extend the analysis beyond demographics and payment
characteristics to pricing incentives such as card affinity programs (rewards) and acceptance of
payment cards. The analysis by Briglevics and Schuh (2013a) estimates a structural inventory
28Arango, Bouhdaoui, Bounie, Eschelbach, and Hern´
andez (2013) extend this work by conducting the test for
CA, FR, DE, and NL.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
model of cash holdings and finds a significant effect on payment choice.
7.3 Merchant steering
The payment diaries have been used to study the effect of market structure on payment choice.
Recent work by Shy (2014) investigates the effect of the debit card interchange fees and sorts
out the transaction value at which interchange fees become higher or lower due to the new
rule. Briglevics and Shy (2012) use the payment diaries to understand merchant steering. They
compute the expected net cost of discounts on cash and debit card payments and find that, for
the most part, steering is unprofitable. Welte (2014) studies and extends the steering exercise
by embedding a consumer choice into the expected net cost calculations for CA.
7.4 Scanner data projects
Scanner data have been touted as an alternative to payment diaries as a method of data collec-
tion on payments. For US, Klee (2008) uses data to show that payment choice is a function
of the amount of time spent processing the items purchased. Research by Polasik, G´
orka,
Wilczewski, Kunkowski, Przenajkowska, and Tetkowska (2012) for Poland demonstrates the
usage of chronometric methods to enumerate the processing time of payments. Recent work
by Wang and Wolman (2014) extends the work of Klee (2008) by using scanner data from a
large discount retailer.
These scanner data studies provide rich detailed information, including the opportunity cost
of time. One drawback of these scanner data projects is that direct demographic data are not
collected. Therefore, it is hard to infer the role of consumer demographics on payment choice.
Recent work by Cohen and Rysman (2013) avoids this criticism by obtaining demographic
information with the scanner data.
8 Payment Diaries: Going Forward
This section describes possible future use of payment diaries. We focus on three main points:
structural models of cash and alternative means of payment, high-frequency consumption/savings,
and the study of two-sided markets. We also discuss some caveats and ideas to improve the
collection of data.
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
8.1 Structural models of cash and alternative method of payments
The estimation of money demand has relied mostly on the workhorse Baumol-Tobin model.
However, this model was constructed in the absence of payment cards. The presence of pay-
ment cards has been exploited to understand household money demand elasticities; see Mul-
ligan and Sala-i-Martin (2000) or Attanasio, Guiso, and Jappelli (2002). These studies also
document that consumers do not wait until a zero cash balance before withdrawing. This in-
spired Alvarez and Lippi (2009), who explain this puzzle by introducing a positive probability
of a free withdrawal. Another salient feature is that some consumers hold large amounts of
cash. Alvarez and Lippi (2013b) rationalize this feature by modeling the large and lumpy pur-
chases that require cash. Further, Alvarez and Lippi (2013a) allow merchant non-acceptance
of cards as a reason to hold precautionary cash balances.
Most payment diaries contain information about cash management behaviour but little is
known about the rationale for such holdings. Most diaries do not include questions on pre-
cautionary motives or the need to make lumpy purchases. Therefore, it is hard to distinguish
between cash management versus acceptance of payment cards as a reason to hold cash. Fur-
ther, care must be taken to conduct the statistical sampling behind these questions. The diaries
rely on a short-term window to focus in on behaviour that may be infrequent.
Nosal and Rocheteau (2012) offer an extensive discussion of the new monetarist approach,
which has stressed various real trading frictions to explain the coexistence of cash with cards.
For example, Telyukova and Wright (2008) explain why households hold cash while having a
credit balance with a rate-of-return dominance puzzle; i.e., cash is held for liquidity reasons
to settle claims. The current payment diaries focus mainly on payment choice and expendi-
tures. There is scant information about credit arrangements, i.e., an indicator of whether or
not a household has carried a balance from month-to-month. Therefore, to empirically validate
these models would require detailed household balance-sheet information.
8.2 High-frequency consumption and saving
Recent work by Aruoba, Diebold, and Scotti (2009) highlights the usefulness of real-time mon-
itoring of consumption for business cycles. Private and public sector forecasters spend enor-
mous resources to understand consumption, as it is a large component of GDP. Galbraith and
(&%:RUNLQJ3DSHU-XQH 
Tkacz (2013) demonstrate the utility of using network data on debit and credit card payments
to understand consumption. The recent financial crisis has highlighted the need to understand
high-frequency movements in consumption and consumer confidence; see Parker, Souleles,
Johnson, and McClelland (2013) and Lachowska (2013).
Payment diaries could be a useful method to track the high-frequency consumption and/or
expenditures of households. They could be used to understand the effect of fiscal policy on
consumption. Agarwal and McGranahan (2012) argue that sales tax holidays have an effect on
consumption but the timing of these effects cannot be clearly identified. Also, Mastrobuoni and
Weinberg (2010) demonstrate that exact pay dates have an impact on consumption, especially
for social security recipients. Payment diaries would need to be redesigned to incorporate
questions to determine these effects.
8.3 Two-sided markets and regulation
Rochet and Tirole (2002) and Wright (2003) discuss the theoretical nature of two-sided mar-
kets for the payments literature. The work on estimating these two-sided markets, with the
exception of Rysman (2007), uses network data to study the usage of credit cards, network
externalities, and multi-homing. Also, recent work by Shy and Wang (2011) discusses why
interchange fees are proportional.
Payment diaries contain detailed data on consumer payments but only a few questions on
merchant characteristics (i.e., venue and acceptance of cards). Recent work by Bounie, Fran-
cois, and Hove (2014) matches payment diary data to a nationwide French merchant survey to
investigate the probability that the merchant will accept cards. Future payment diaries could
attempt to collect or at least link their data to merchant costs, or expand the supply-side infor-
mation. However, work by Shy and Stavins (2013) illustrates the difficulty of this task, as they
attempt to embed questions about merchant steering into US payment diaries. Their results are
inconclusive and they discuss the challenges and pitfalls of this exercise. Future attempts to
improve payment diaries should bear this in mind.

9 Conclusions
Many have predicted and espoused the view that cash is increasingly disappearing as a payment
instrument; see Wolman (2012). However, to paraphrase Mark Twain, we would say that the
reports of the death of cash have been greatly exaggerated. This paper shows that in all seven
countries considered, cash is still used extensively ­ particularly for low-value transactions.
In some European countries such as Austria and Germany, cash even dominates consumer
payment choices for all transaction values.
This paper demonstrates that, apart from transaction sizes and consumer preferences for
ease of use, the use of cash is strongly correlated with demographics and point-of-sale char-
acteristics such as merchant card acceptance and venue. This largely confirms the results of
earlier studies that were based on data from only one or a small number of countries. Our find-
ing that these results can be observed for all seven countries assures us that these are universal
factors driving cash use.
Our paper signals the importance of cross-country differences. First, the level of cash usage
differs across the various countries. Second, differences can be found in the type of alternatives
used for cash. Some countries often use credit cards as a substitute; in other countries, mainly
debit cards are used. One explanation for these cross-country differences could be found in
differences in market structures and the pricing policies of retail payments. Rysman (2009),
for instance, highlights how market structure affects payments, or vice-versa. Third, we point at
an important correlation between cash use and the amount of cash balances consumers carry.
The direction of the correlation remains unclear. Therefore, as country differences are still
substantial, and given the remaining questions on the role and effect of cash balances, further
work is required to more fully ascertain the underlying drivers of consumers' use of cash and
alternative payment methods.

Notes: For these Diary-to-Aggregate Expenditure Ratios we calculate the total annual per-person expenditure in
local currency, by multiplying the average per-person per-day expenditure figure from each diary with 365 days. We
compare this estimated annual consumption figure with national accounts data from the OECD website. We start
with the time series labelled "P31NC: Final consumption expend. of res. households on the territory and abroad"
and subtract "P33: Final consumption expenditure of resident households abroad." We also subtract "P31CP040:
Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels" to arrive at a concept of consumption expenditure more comparable
to what we have in the diaries. The diaries do not cover recurrent payments and most of the payments for housing
and utilities are recurring. Finally, we divide the calculated consumption expenditure by the total adult population,
implying that we assume that the responses to our diaries do not include consumption expenditure for minors. To
harmonize the transaction values in this study, we use PPP-adjusted USD. PPP exchange rates are taken from the
OECD:

Notes: The dependent variable takes a value of 1 if a payment is made by cash and zero if it is made by debit or
credit. Results for location (urban/rural), marital status, gender, employment status and family size are not
shown. Variables are defined in Table A.1. TV Q2, TV Q3, and TV Q4 denote the second to fourth quartile of
transaction values. Standard errors are in parentheses and the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels of significance are
denoted by ***, **, *, respectively.

Notes: The figure shows normalized perceptions of cash relative to debit and credit. A positive (negative) value
indicates that cash is perceived better (worse) than the respective payment card. Due to differences in the
wording of survey questions, the harmonization is only approximate. Values for acceptance and costs are not
available for FR. For DE, values are taken from the 2008 payment diary. Authors' calculations based on
questionnaire and diary surveys.

A Appendix
Table A.1: Definition of Variables
Income 3 dummy variables; 1 if income is in the highest income tercile
(High Income), lowest income tercile (Low Income) or in the
middle income tercile (Medium Income), 0 else.
Age 3 dummy variables; 1 if age of respondents is above 60 (Aged
over 60), between 36 and 59 (Aged 36 to 59) or between 18 and
35 (Aged under 36), 0 else.
Education 3 dummy variables: Low Education, Middle Education and High
Education. Although the exact definitions depend on the coun-
try, the definitions are based on whether a respondent has fin-
ished mandatory schooling, secondary schooling and some post-
secondary education.
Not home owner Dummy variable; 1 if respondent does not own his place of resi-
dence.
Perceptions The analysis employs perceptions on Ease of Use, Cost, Security
and Acceptance. These are derived from the question as to how
much cash fulfills the listed attributes. The values are normal-
ized by results for other methods of payment, such that a positive
(negative) value implies that cash is valued better (worse) than
cash or credit. The normalization is described in Arango, Huynh,
and Sabetti (2011).
Cash on hand Defined as the usual (average) cash holdings of a person. It is
taken from survey questionnaires and not from the diaries. We
drop all observations above the 99.5 percent mark and normalize
this variable. As a consequence, Cash on hand is a unitless scalar.
Type of purchase Several dummy variables; 1 if purchase is classified as Grocery,
Gas Station, (Semi-)Durable, Services or Entertainment, 0 else.
Transaction value quartiles Quartiles are formed from all observed transaction values. 4
dummy variables, which are 1 if a transaction falls in Transac-
tion Value Quartile 1 to 4 (TV Q1 to TV Q4), 0 else.
Card acceptance share Respondents indicate whether a transaction could have been con-
ducted by card. From these observations, we calculate the share
of transactions with card acceptance for each individual. To avoid
endogeneity, we then calculate the mean of individual card ac-
ceptance shares for nine pre-specified population groups that are
formed from three income and three age groups. Acceptance
Group thus reflects the mean acceptance of the income/education
population group that a respondent belongs to.
