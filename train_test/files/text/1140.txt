Abstract
Demographic research focuses mainly on objective variables found in census and
survey data. As demographers' interests expand to socially constructed phenomena, the
discipline needs to incorporate new tools appropriate for understanding more subjective
phenomena. The integration of quantitative and qualitative methods provides the
opportunity to analyze data both rich in local meaning and generalizable beyond a small
"N." This type of triangulation is particularly necessary in the study of women's
situation, an area in which quantitative results have generally confounded
demographers. Using survey and ethnographic data, I demonstrate in this paper ways in
which qualitative data complements quantitative data on women's situation. I argue that
such an iterative methodological process can enrich future investigations in this area by
comparing findings, contextualizing quantitative results, and improving the
conceptualization of future quantitative measures.

1. Introduction
In this paper, I show how demographers can employ qualitative data and methods to
enhance quantitative research. Furthermore, I discuss why demographers who are
interested in socio-cultural issues such as gender should supplement their tool box with
qualitative methods. I use an integrated qualitative/quantitative study of women's
situation in rural Malawi as a case study to demonstrate that the sum of the two data
sources can be greater than the separate parts.
Demographers typically use quantitative data (e.g., from censuses, surveys) to
examine macro-level processes and to focus on aggregate, often cross-cultural,
comparisons. Effective analysis of objective quantifiable variables benefits from an
understanding of the social context from which they come. When examining variables
and concepts that are socially constructed and defined, however, it is essential to
contextualize the variables of interest. In this paper, I give examples of qualitative
methods that are accessible to demographers, methods that can improve the
interpretation of quantitative findings and the quality of quantitative measures. As
social demographers probe the relationship between demographic outcomes and socio-
cultural concepts such as gender, this type of investigation clearly shows a need for
triangulating data sources, particularly an iterative process of qualitative and
quantitative data collection. By nesting qualitative work within survey research,
demographers retain the breadth and generalizability available through survey data and
gain rich nuanced information to help them explain gendered realities in the local
context.
2. Demographers investigate women's situation
The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) piqued
demographers' interest in the study of women's position because it posited a
relationship between women's situation (status, autonomy, and empowerment) and
sexual and reproductive health outcomes. As a result of this focus, demographers have
investigated the theorized relationship between women's situation and fertility-related
behavior (Blanc et al. 1996; Dharmalingam and Morgan 1996; Hindin 2000; Jejeebhoy
2001; Mason 1987; Mason and Smith 1999; Morgan and Niraula 1995; Morgan et al.
2002; Oheneba-Sakyi 1999; Ouedraogo and Pictet 2000; Presser and Sen 2000; Schatz
2002). Quantitative findings in this area have largely confounded researchers; few
authors have found positive relationships between women's position and fertility
outcomes (exceptions include Hindin 2000; Morgan and Niraula 1995; Morgan et al.
2002). Demographers still do not have a clear understanding of the links between
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 145
women's situation and reproductive health, despite their attempts to capture the multi-
dimensionality of women's position with both proxies (e.g., education, employment
status, and age at marriage) and more proximate measures (e.g., freedom of movement,
household decision-making power, violence against women) (Blanc et al. 1996;
Ghuman et al. 2000; Jejeebhoy 2000; Kabeer 1999; Kishor and Neitzel 1996; Mason
1986; Mason and Smith 2001).
The lack of evidence of a relationship between women's situation and fertility-
related behavior may be partly attributable to inappropriate or poorly specified
measures (Mason and Smith 2001). Demographers are still in the early stages of
understanding gender and how to measure it. Many variables that demographers use to
denote gender refer to "women," but actually do not capture gendered realities (Kaler
2001; Riley 1999; Watkins 1993). Proximate measures of women's situation move the
conceptualization of gender in the right direction. Even these variables, however, lack
consensus among demographers in terms of terminology, meaning, and measurement.
These proximate measures are largely associated with male-female relations of power
and authority, about which Mason and Smith (2001) have "very little confidence that
we are measuring ...in a meaningful way" (p 1).
There are some basic disadvantages and problems with current quantitative
measures of women's situation; I will mention four that have affected my own work.
First, existing data often lack qualitative grounding or cultural adaptation;
understanding the gender context prior to creating survey questions is crucial. Questions
with cultural meaning and significance in capturing women's situation in Asia may not
capture the same concepts in Africa. Second, survey researchers often include questions
that explicitly measure women's situation only on women's questionnaires (Becker
1996; Kaler 2001; Watkins 1993). Although intuitively it may make sense to ask
women about women's situation, researchers miss information about norms and
household dynamics when the male perspective is absent from the analysis (Becker
1996). Third, the dichotomous nature of common proximate measures hides situational
nuances; for example, describing how or why a decision was made. One way to address
the latter issue is through better-specified questions that are based on an understanding
of the local context. Another solution is to allow for open responses to survey
questions. When those solutions are insufficient, demographers need to look to
qualitative data to reveal and explain those nuances. Fourth, quantitative measures of
women's situation rarely sufficiently address gendered processes in the household.
Qualitative data can reveal not only what happens between women and men in a
household, but also how and why these events occur, and they can do so in ways that
quantitative data cannot capture. Although better quantitative data can and should
address some of these issues, a more-nuanced conceptualization of the gendered
processes and of the local context gained through the collection of qualitative data will
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
146 http://www.demographic-research.org
forward demographers' understanding of women's situation. Furthermore, this
understanding can illuminate quantitative data on women's position in new ways.
I am not arguing that demographers should throw out survey methods and become
ethnographers. Instead, I believe that demographers can use qualitative data and
methods to collect better quantitative data and to improve an understanding and
interpretation of survey results (Knodel 1997; Mason and Smith 2001; Obermeyer
1997). Qualitative methods and data can lend themselves to three important
improvements in quantitative data: 1) testing of quantitative findings, 2)
contextualization of results, and 3) conceptualization of concepts and variables.
Although my main focus in this paper is on furthering demographic research on
women's situation, my case study can also be used as an example of the usefulness of
qualitative methods for the study of other social phenomena.
3. Gender and context in rural Malawi: a case study
The case study I present uses survey and ethnographic data from the Malawi Diffusion
and Ideational Change Project (MDICP). MDICP fielded a survey in 1998 (N~1500
women and their spouses), and I conducted supplemental qualitative projects in 1999
and 2000 (N~50 women and their spouses). The MDICP data used in this paper come
from two areas of rural Malawi--one site in the southern region and one site in the
northern region. The MDICP 1998 survey (henceforth referred to as Malawi 1) included
measures of women's education and income as well as a gender module with more
proximate measures of women's situation. The ethnographic data include my own non-
participant observations and repeated in-depth interviews with 91 respondents (50
women and 41 men). This case study demonstrates the advantages of combining
quantitative and qualitative data to further an understanding of women's situation in
rural Malawi. The quantitative data provide a sense of macro-level attitudes and
opinions about women's situation and enable a statistical analysis of the relationship
between women's situation and reproductive outcomes. Although such statistical
relationships are difficult to establish with qualitative data, the in-depth interviews
uncover processes and mechanisms that underlie women's situation at the micro-level.
By integrating the two data sources, I begin to unpack the "black-box" of women's
situation in rural Malawi. The nested nature of my study allows me to compare directly
qualitative and survey responses of individual respondents as well as to extrapolate my
qualitative findings to the larger MDICP study population.

4. Data and methods
In 1998, MDICP conducted a survey in three study sites, one in each of Malawi's three
regions: Rumphi in the north, Mchinji in the center, and Balaka in the south (Note 1). I
restrict both my quantitative and qualitative data to the respondents interviewed in the
northern and southern sites. These two sites present a clear contrast in terms of
ethnicity, religion, and kin structure. The majority of households in the northern site are
Tumbuka, Protestant, patrilineal, and patrilocal, whereas the population in the southern
site is predominantly Yao and Muslim and generally follows matrilineal and matrilocal
residence patterns (Note 2). Both of these sites are in rural areas with very few
amenities--e.g., no running water or electricity. In addition, the level of poverty in
these areas is generally quite high (Malawi Government 2000; UNIMA Center for
Social Research and SARDC-WIDSAA 1997).
Between 1998 and 2000, I completed a small pilot and then a larger ethnographic
study--the Gender Context Study (GCS) (Note 3). During that period, I devoted three
months to the collection of qualitative data in the form of non-participant observation
and semi-structured interviews in 14 villages in the northern and southern MDICP
study areas. My qualitative research focused on gendered mechanisms and processes
within households and the larger community.
4.1 Malawi 1 Survey and GCS Samples
In each of the MDICP sites, the 1998 survey sample consists of approximately 500
ever-married women of childbearing age (between the ages 15 and 49) and their
spouses. The sample for the two sites on which I focus includes 1174 women and 1002
men. The survey response rate was 85% among women (999 women) and 67% among
men (670 men).
For the GCS, I selected a purposeful sub-sample of 50 couples from the Malawi 1
sample. Although a random sub-sample might have helped to legitimize claims of
accurate representation of the Malawi 1 sample, the purposeful sub-sample assured
heterogeneity of the Malawi 1 sample, ensuring variation in age, marital status,
marriage type, lineage, and residence patterns (Note 4). Table 1 shows the regional
distribution of the GCS sample by these characteristics (Note 5). The sampled couples
in the southern site came from three Malawi 1 villages. I drew the sample in the
northern site from three clusters of Malawi 1 villages; each cluster approximated the
size of the villages in the southern site. I interviewed 76% of the originally sampled
couples; after replacing the couples that I was unable to find, the couple response rate
was 98% (Note 6).

4.2 Measures of women's situation
In addition to collecting common proxies of women's situation such as educational
attainment, economic activity, age at marriage, and age difference between spouses, the
Malawi 1 survey included a gender module with potentially relevant proximate
measures of women's situation. Table 2 shows the Malawi 1 survey findings for the
four sets of proximate measures: 1) women's perceived control over reproductive
decision-making (four questions), 2) attitudes about divorce (five questions), 3)
attitudes about freedom of movement (2 questions), and 4) women's control over
money (three questions). These questions operationalize multiple dimensions of
women's situation--decision-making, attitudes about divorce, movement, and
economic control (Mason 1986). I included the Malawi 1 gender module topics on the
semi-structured GCS interview guide. By collecting data on similar topics, I was able
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5

http://www.demographic-research.org 149
to compare responses on the Malawi 1 fixed-choice questions to the GCS open-ended
responses.

The qualitative interviews further explored issues associated with marriage,
polygyny, household decision-making, family planning, and HIV/AIDS. I developed
the GCS interview guide primarily to investigate questions that initial quantitative
findings from the Malawi 1 survey raised about power and authority in gendered
relations (Schatz 1999, 2000, 2002). These findings will be discussed in more detail
below.
The emergent 1994 ICPD ideology as well as previous demographic, sociological,
and anthropological research led the MDICP team to believe that women who report a
greater sense of control over their own fertility, who had more liberal attitudes about
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
150 http://www.demographic-research.org
divorce, who reported greater freedom of movement, and who had more control over
income sources would have greater status, autonomy and power (Blanc et al. 1996;
Mason 1986; McIntosh and Finkle 1995; Sen 1990; Sen, Germain, and Chen 1994;
United Nations 1995). MDICP researchers also expected to find that women in the
matrilineal/matrilocal southern site would score higher than women in the northern site
on the women's situation indicators (Davison 1997; Dyson and Moore 1983; Peters
1997a, 1997b; Vaughn 1983). Furthermore, although there is limited evidence of a
relationship between women's situation and reproductive behavior, the premise for
collecting such quantitative data was primarily to analyze relationships between gender
variables and fertility behavior as well as other sexual and reproductive health outcomes
(Blanc et al. 1996; Mason and Smith 1999, 2001).
My analyses of the Malawi 1 survey data show that rather than correlating with
one another, each of the four dimensions had different levels and salience in the two
regions (Schatz 1999, 2002). In addition, I found that a higher percentage of women in
the northern site reported autonomous behavior than women in the southern site on
many of the indicators (see Table 2). At the individual level, the relationships between
women's situation measures and fertility behavior (e.g., contraceptive use, unmet need)
were weak and inconsistent. Neither individual measures of women's situation nor
indices of multiple questions (determined by theme and factor analyses) were correlated
with fertility behavior. Furthermore, logistic regression analyses, which controlled for
demographic characteristics and other relevant variables, revealed few significant
results. Among the women's situation measures, only the family planning decision-
making index was a significant predictor of fertility behavior. I went on to examine
regional differences in women's situation; and, finally, I regressed each of the fertility
outcomes on regionally grouped data for each of the women's situation indices in order
to assess the regional-level relationship therein. The results showed that women in the
southern site did not consistently score higher on these measures than women in the
northern site, as I had expected they would. In addition, at the aggregate level, the only
consistent significant relationship was between the family planning decision-making
index and ever-use of a modern method of contraception. These unexpected results
raise many questions about women's situation in rural areas of Malawi, or at least raise
questions about the measurement of women's situation in this setting. I decided to
explore these surprising findings with a rigorous qualitative study.
The GCS gave me a sense that women in the North and South differed in ways not
reflected in the survey results. The in-depth interviews, which explored unanswered
questions from the quantitative analysis, further proved this point. These questions
included why women in the southern site did not have consistently greater autonomy,
status, and power than women in the northern site and why freedom of movement,
attitudes about divorce, and control over money did not seem to predict fertility
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 151
behavior. I found that the social environments and constraints differ greatly between the
two sites, primarily because of differences in residence patterns, kin networks, and
physical proximity to busy roads. I also found that, despite considerable variations in
social environments, women in Malawi, in both the North and South, were not meek or
disempowered. Rather, through the interviews and observing village life, I discovered
that women in Malawi find ways to influence and, at times, to manipulate their
environment to get what they want.
4.3 Rigorous qualitative data collection
During my time in the field, I trained 16 local interviewers, who then conducted
repeated semi-structured interviews with 50 female and 41 male respondents (Note 7).
Rather than interviewing respondents myself through a translator, I opted to have the
local interviewers conduct the interviews to improve their flow (Note 8). However,
having the local interviewers conduct the interviews without my interference made
rigorous interviewer-training essential. If the interviewers had not grasped the concepts
of the study or had not developed very good qualitative interviewing skills, the project
would not have been successful.
The interviewers I hired had worked mainly with MDICP as enumerators for
survey data collection. Thus, it was crucial for me to stress the following issues in
training: 1) the need to ask questions in a format that did not allow single-word
responses, 2) the merits of prompting respondents to elaborate on their answers, and 3)
the importance of creating a conversational atmosphere with the respondent to enable
the respondent to shape the conversation along with the interviewer (Note 9). During
the training sessions, I also focused on the importance of verbal and listening skills,
which improve qualitative interviewing. I continued working very closely with the local
interviewers during the four days of training and throughout the fieldwork to ensure
high quality of the data.
My presence in the field provided me with a unique opportunity to follow up each
respondent's first general interview with a more-directed second interview. I was able
to get more-complete stories by reading the English transcription of the first interview
and creating a unique second interview-guide for each respondent. In this way, I was
able to gain additional insight into issues that the first interview did not fully reveal as
well as to fill in gaps where an interviewer had missed or misunderstood a question on
the first-round interview guide. That two-part interviewing process gave me back some
of the control over the interviewing process that I had lost by not conducting the
interviews myself.
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
152 http://www.demographic-research.org
Once the interviews were transcribed and typed, I inductively coded them
following Corbin and Strauss' guidelines--reading the interviews for emergent themes
(Corbin and Strauss 1990; Strauss and Corbin 1990). Inductive coding involves closely
reading each transcript and creating codes--phrases or words--that capture the idea or
theme of a section. About 150 themes emerged while I coded the interviews, and
another 350 smaller sub-codes emerged within those themes. I then grouped these into
20 axial-code categories. These coding groups facilitated the analyses of the qualitative
data.
5. Comparing, contextualizing, and conceptualizing
The Malawi 1 survey contributes to demographic research on women's situation
through proximate measures and by facilitating an analysis of the relationship between
those measures and fertility behavior. Alone, however, these data are limited
conceptually and in scope. This is not to suggest, however, that these quantitative data
have no merit, but that they more-prominently advance research when they are
combined with the nested GCS qualitative data. In the following sections, I compare
findings from the two data sources, showing how the qualitative data can act as a check
for hypothesized and unexpected survey findings. I employ the qualitative data to
contextualize the quantitative data, illuminating social practices, beliefs, and norms that
shape women's position. Finally, I use the qualitative data to conceptualize better
qualitative measures to use in rural Malawi in the future.
5.1 Comparing samples and findings: the advantages of a nested study
Nesting the GCS study within the MDICP had two main advantages: 1) it reduced the
non-representativeness of my purposefully selected qualitative sub-sample; and 2) it
enabled me to directly compare quantitative and qualitative responses for individual
respondents.
5.2 Extrapolating from a small "N"

significant differences between the GCS sub-sample and the Malawi 1 sample
(significant differences are in bold italics). I tested differences between the two samples
in STATA using unpaired `ttests' for the difference between means and `prtests' for
differences in the proportion of women who answered given questions in the
affirmative. The only variables for which there are significant differences between the
two samples are the number of children ever born (total samples), mean years of
schooling (northern samples), and women reporting the acceptability of divorcing a
man who does not support his wife financially (total samples, southern samples). The
most-striking differences shown in Table 3 are not those between the GCS sub-sample
and the Malawi 1 sample, but, rather, differences between the women living in the
southern site and those living in the North. The similarities, as seen in this table,
between the two samples are remarkable considering the small sub-sample size and the
fact that I purposefully sampled respondents on other characteristics (age, marital
status, marriage type, residence, and lineage). The match of the GCS and Malawi 1
samples gives me confidence that I can extrapolate trends and concepts found in the
GCS data to the larger Malawi 1 population.
5.3 Comparing quantitative and qualitative responses
The nested GCS sample allows for direct comparison of the survey findings with
narratives on similar topics. The qualitative data can then help to clarify the ways in
which respondents understood the Malawi 1 questions--i.e., what they heard, how they
thought they were responding, and the details missed because of the questions'
dichotomous nature. Table 4 provides an example of how the fixed-choice questions
differed from the open-ended questions, juxtaposing the survey schedule with the
qualitative interview schedule for the freedom of movement questions. Below I
compare how women answered these questions in 1998 and 2000.
The narratives that emerged from the GCS questions about freedom of movement
revealed that the form of the Malawi 1 questions was problematic. The two freedom of
movement questions on the Malawi 1 survey asked specifically about whether or not a
woman could go to the health center or the market without her husband's permission.
The only possible answers were "yes" or "no." The qualitative accounts, however,
make it clear that women make decisions about movement on a case-by-case basis--for
the majority of women, a discrete "yes" or "no" answer was insufficient. In both the
southern and the northern sites, the decision of whether or not to ask permission from
one's husband before going somewhere depends on many factors: 1) how urgent the
trip is; 2) how far the place is from her home; 3) how long the trip will to take; 4) how
clear the purpose of the trip is; 5) if her husband is around or not, and if leaving a note
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 155
is sufficient notification or not; or 6) if she needs/has the money needed for the trip.
Women may take all or some of these factors into account when determining whether or
not to ask their husbands for permission before going somewhere.

Taking advantage of the nested GCS sample, we can look at a couple of examples
of women who reported seemingly contradictory responses between the survey and the
qualitative interviews. For example, Lyness, a 22-year-old mother of two from the
northern site, reported on the Malawi 1 survey that she could go to neither the market
nor the health center without her husband's permission (Note 11). In 2000, in the in-
depth interviews, it became clear that there are times when she goes places without first
getting her husband's permission:
[There are] many things [that I do only after telling my husband]. Like business
issues, I need to tell him I want to do such-and-such a business. If there is
money needed to buy relish [vegetables], going to the maize mill, well, I tell
him [that I need money]. [Other things I do without telling him like] buying
relish, if there is money already, I go on my own. Whether I need soap and I
have the money, I just go on my own (113002, North 2000).
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
156 http://www.demographic-research.org
Sometimes Lyness does ask permission or informs her husband before going places--
this may take the form of asking for money to go to the market or maize mill. At other
times, particularly if she already has money, she goes on her own; that was not clear
from her survey responses.
Emily is another respondent who reported in 1998 that she would not go to either
the market or the health center without her husband's permission. Emily lives in the
southern site; she is 43 years old and has five children and one co-wife. Despite
claiming in 1998 that she cannot go places without her husband's permission, she
related the following story in 2000:
The first time we separated [it was] because of a trip. We had a women's [church
guild] trip to Monkey Bay [~100 km away], and we all contributed money for
the trip. When I told him [I was going], [he did not want me to go]. But, I just
went there on my own wish, and when I came back, I found him gone to his first
wife with his belongings... And I just told myself to let him go, if he needs me,
he will come back... Then after a week, I saw him coming. I greeted him and he
said, `I have come as you are my wife.' And I said, `I thought you would not
come again.' I accused him of separating despite the fact that I had gone to listen
to God's words and not just anywhere. He said, `Okay, it was just a mistake,'
and that he would not do it again. Then we continued staying together (9011,
South 2000).
The story that she told in 2000 demonstrates that she did in fact ask her husband for
permission before going on this trip, which took her much farther than either the local
market or health center. When her husband refused permission, however, she decided to
go anyway. Her actions led to a short marital separation, but when her husband
returned, it was he, not she, who apologized.
Nearly all of the women who reported on the Malawi 1 survey that they could go
to the health center and/or the market without permission also gave less-definitive
answers about movement in the qualitative interviews. In 1998, Rose, a 39-year-old
married woman with five children from the North, said that she can go to both the
health center and the market without asking permission. When asked in the GCS
interview what would happen if she went somewhere without first asking her husband,
she said, "Then we could not agree. When I am going out, I have to inform him. If I
don't, then I would be annoying him. He would ask me why I do that" (112011, Rumphi
2000). However, she went on to say that there are places that she can go and only
inform her husband on her return. For example, she told the following story: "I
remember one time I went to Mhuju [nearby trading center] to get my dress at a tailor
when [my husband] was out... When I came back, he asked me where I had gone.
`Why did you not tell me you were going away?' Then I told him that I went out
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 157
because he was away" (112011, Rumphi 2000). Rose's examples as well as the earlier
narratives show that women may perceive a need to ask their husbands for permission
before going places, but that, in actuality, their decision to seek or not to seek
permission before going somewhere depends on the circumstances of the situation.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to conclude that the quantitative and qualitative
results are systematically opposite of one another. Instead, the qualitative interviews
exposed that decisions about movement are situational. From the qualitative narratives
we can see that the Malawi 1 freedom of movement findings can be misleading.
Conducting in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of the Malawi 1 sample enabled me
to compare not only general qualitative and quantitative responses, but also responses
by individual respondents. The qualitative responses showed that women, regardless of
whether or not they reported in 1998 that they could go to the market or health center
without asking permission, were actually making decisions about going places on a
case-by-case basis and were weighing a number of factors before making a decision to
go somewhere. Thus, in 1998, the responses to these fixed-choice questions likely
depended on the particular situation the respondent was recalling. This knowledge can
help demographers to construct a more-precise quantitative instrument by clarifying a
need to direct respondents to discuss a specific time the event occurred (e.g., the last
time) and probing for factors that contributed to the final decision.
5.4 Contextualizing quantitative data
The questions on the Malawi 1 survey that measure each of the women's situation
dimensions are helpful in revealing aggregate levels of these measures, but they cannot
fully address how families make decisions about contraceptive use, divorce, physical
mobility, and money. The qualitative data help to contextualize these issues as well as
to expand the understanding of how each of these is operationalized in the local context.
The GCS data can help to contextualize Malawi 1 survey data by revealing reasons for
unexpected results, offering multiple perspectives and explanations about each issue,
accounting for the processes and mechanisms by which decisions are made and
opinions are formed, and providing a thick description of the local environment. All of
these provide grounding to the survey data and depict in more-nuanced detail the world
in which the Malawi 1 respondents live.
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
158 http://www.demographic-research.org
5.5 Unanticipated differences, contextualizing unexpected findings
In 2000, while spending time traveling from my accommodations in each site to the
field, I became acutely aware of social and physical differences between the MDICP
northern and southern sites (Note 12). Although these areas are quite similar in certain
ways--both are about 25 kilometers from a town, and none of the residents in either site
has access to amenities such as running water or electricity--the two sites differ greatly
in terms of social and physical layouts. The ability to monitor one's spouse, or wife in
particular, is very different in the two sites for two reasons: 1) social structure and
residence and 2) physical closeness to a main road. These differences shed light on the
unexpected quantitative results that showed that a much-higher percentage of women in
the northern site ranked high on the freedom of movement measures than women in the
southern site (see Table 2 above). The qualitative interviews with both the women and
their husbands also support the findings that contextual differences drive the
quantitative results rather than differences in women's situation per se. It could
alternatively be argued that these cultural differences influence and shape women's
situation (Jejeebhoy 2000; Jejeebhoy and Sathar 2001; Morgan et al. 2002).
The sites' proximity to a main road or trading center is also an influence on the
differences between the North and South in women's freedom of movement: the
southern site encircles a trading center; in the North, the majority of Malawi 1
respondents live several kilometers from a main road. Thus, in the South, the "market"
and "health center" are along busy main roads where women are outside of their
village-environment. In the North, the "market" and "health center" are more contained
within their communities. Partly because of those differences, mobility has a different
meaning or weight in the two sites.
Another factor affecting women's movement differently in the two sites has to do
with the ability of the husband's family members to monitor women's movements. This
distinction is mainly a function of social structure--i.e., who lives around the couple
and helps the man to monitor his wife's movements. In the northern site, married
women usually live among their husbands' kin. In the southern site, there is much-more
fluidity of residence, but many of the married female respondents live among their own
kin. Having the husband's kin, in addition to the man himself, living in the area may
increase a family's ability to monitor a woman's movements and, thus, effectively
increase her freedom to move within a contained area. For example, if a man's kin are
dispersed throughout a village, they can keep track of his wife's movements; thus, his
wife may be able to move freely throughout that village without arousing suspicions of
misconduct because her husband's relatives know where she is. In future survey rounds,
these issues of where services are situated and the ability of kin to monitor a woman's
movement can be constructed as variables and added to the survey instrument. Once
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 159
quantified, it would be possible to control for these issues to get a more-nuanced sense
of women's freedom of movement.
5.6 Multiple perspectives, emerging meanings
Men's role in shaping women's situation, especially within the context of the couple's
relationship, necessitates the integration of men's opinions about women's status,
autonomy, and power with women's views on those topics. Because men play an
equally important role in the social construction of gender, men's narratives provide a
significant piece of information missing from the Malawi 1 study (Note 13). In
addition, because women's situation is primarily about male-female relationships of
power and authority, effectively measuring concepts such as freedom of movement
requires a ruler against which to assess women's freedom of movement.
The qualitative data also revealed that men often need to ask their wives'
permission or inform their wives before going places. Joseph, a 62-year-old man, is
living with his wife and five children on her family's property. He divulged why it is
important for him to check in with his wife before going somewhere. "I tell her about
everything that I want to do. Even if I want to go and visit my friend, I tell her so that
she will know where I am in case she needs me" (9524, South 2000). Sentiments
expressed in the northern site are not very different. Bright is in his early-40s; he lives
with his wife and their four children on his family's land. He differentiated between
needing to `beg permission' and `informing' his wife of his comings and goings:
[I am] not necessarily begging for permission but informing her--say I am going
to see my friends. Then she can ask if she wants to know where I am going, to
see my sister or anyone. ...[I inform her] because when I go there, she knows
that I am going to see my sister; there is no reason for begging her permission.
...[I go without asking permission] when I go out walking to pass hours away
where I know that I would be back in a short time. But when I know I am going
to spend a night there, I have to bid farewell. ...[I bid farewell] so that my
spouse knows where I have gone. If I go without telling her, she would be
looking for me (141515, North 2000).
From these excerpts, we learn that men too are constrained by needing to inform their
wives before going places. This supplemental knowledge about the system of informing
one's spouse and the two-way restrictions on physical mobility redefines how the
researcher understands "asking permission." For both men and women in this context,
the need to "beg permission" or "inform" one's spouse seems to be more about courtesy
between spouses than about autonomy. Additional questions about men's movement
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
160 http://www.demographic-research.org
could be added to future quantitative instruments to permit a comparison between men
and women's mobility.
MDICP adapted the freedom of movement questions from the Status of Women
and Fertility (SWAF) Project conducted in five Asian countries (Note 14). One reason
that these questions may not have worked as well in Malawi is that, in general,
women's movement is not as restricted in Malawi as it is in Asia and the Middle East
(Caldwell, Caldwell, & Quiggin 1994). In Malawi, as in many other parts of Africa,
women are present in public spheres in all capacities--working as market women,
traveling on public transport, walking along the main roads. Although the matrilineal
southern region is largely Muslim, Muslim women there are not restricted by rules of
purdah. In both the North and the South, it is common to see women walking to and
from the market, carrying children on their backs along the main roads, and gathering
for special programs at local maternal and child health clinics. Thus, rather than asking
women if they were allowed to go to certain places alone, as the SWAF survey had, the
Malawi 1 survey asked women if they have to get their husbands' permission to go to
the market and local health center. Despite the attempt to contextualize the questions, it
seems that further contextualization and improvement are needed.
5.7 Processes and mechanisms
Qualitative inquiry provides the opportunity to record the negotiations by which
decisions are made within a household rather than providing just the final result. A
good example of negotiation processes that the GCS data picked up has to do with the
difficult subject of contraceptive use. The qualitative data show that decisions about
family planning use do not fall into easily defined categories such as "woman decides,"
"spouses agree," or "husband decides."
Men from the southern site stressed the importance of families communicating
about family planning before using it. Michael stated his belief by saying, "Yes, family
planning is about the husband and the wife. If the wife wants to use it, she has to tell her
husband that she wants to use it and not do otherwise" (6507, South 2000). When asked
what a wife should do if her husband refused her request to use family planning, he
responded:
If the husband has refused, then even if the wife started using it secretly, then
there can't be a problem since the husband was told but he refused to give the
wife an okay. [If the husband finds out] there it can be for the two of them
discussing and agreeing what to do, but, according to my own opinion, I think
the husband is the one who can be wrong because, as I have already said, women
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 161
are the ones who feel the delivery so it's at least better to consider them (6507,
South 2000).
Although Michael continued to highlight the need to "discuss and agree," he placed
blame on the man in this scenario. His openness to a woman using family planning
secretly reinforces an idea that arose often in the qualitative narratives: because it is
women who suffer, they should decide what is best in terms of contraceptive use.
Although women are the ones who "suffer" during childbearing, many women do
seek their husband's approval to use contraception. This is often a protracted process.
Abigail, a 40-year-old woman from the southern site who has six children, claimed that
it took her more than five years to convince her husband to let her have a tubal ligation.
When she first returned from the hospital after the birth of their last child, she asked
him about it frequently. However, her husband wanted another child, so she "let him do
what he wanted" (9024, South 2000). She did not actually have another child during
that time, however, because she "stayed for a long time using the injection as a form of
spacing, not to stop" (9024, South 2000). After several years, she asked her husband
again whether he wanted her to become pregnant, which would have necessitated her
stopping use of the injection; his response was, "I will answer you later," postponing
the decision again. After years of continually bringing up the idea of tubal ligation,
Abigail finally succeeded in convincing her husband to allow her to have the operation.
When asked how she finally convinced him, she said:
I was bored [unhappy] with his refusal and one day I told him, "Because you
want me to still bear children, I am accepting what you want. But when I just
have a child I do not feel well." And, I just told him, "Everything you want, I am
going to do. But, you should know that, when I get pregnant and have a child, I
might die and leave a little child with you. Then you will be in trouble because
caring for a little child is difficult for men. I will die while thinking that I am
dying because you didn't want to consider my request." (9024, South 2000)
In 1998, Abigail said that she could do something if her husband did not want her to use
family planning and that she could get her own way if she wanted to stop childbearing.
Clearly, although she did eventually get her own way, it took many years for her to
convince her husband to allow her to do so.
The above accounts reveal some of the ambiguities concerning negotiations about
contraceptive use that were not available in the survey findings. In addition, the
qualitative data reveal the existence of other participants who are petitioned for, and
give advice about, childbearing and family planning use. Men and women related
getting information about modern methods from the radio, health-care workers, friends,
and relatives; and this information often influenced the decision-making process. Some
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
162 http://www.demographic-research.org
of these sources encouraged further communication between spouses, while others
encouraged women to make decisions on their own (Note 15).
Some respondents observed that some women are persuaded to use kulera [family
planning] secretly by other women, clinic workers, and relatives. One man from the
northern site complained to the interviewer about this outside pressure:
At the clinic, they teach women that they have the right to [secretly use kulera].
But because this involves two partners, the husband would ask why she has
started this. They need to agree to use. ...[If I found out my wife was using
secretly], I would criticize her on why she didn't tell me so that I should not
work in vain [i.e., having sex without being able to impregnate her] (141515,
North 2000).
This respondent's objection is partly attributable to the fact that a husband should be
part of the decision-making process about contraceptive use. However, he also joked
that he did not want to be having sex "in vain." He wanted to know when sex was
reproductive and when it was simply recreational.
Interestingly, a woman from the northern site told a different story about what
women hear at the clinics:
I don't know anybody [who has used secretly]; that is not what we are taught at
the clinic. We don't have to practice family planning secretly because your
marriages may end if your husbands find out. ...[My friends and I] agreed that it
was a good idea to tell our husbands before we do anything of this nature in
order to make our marriages strong forever (133010, North 2000).
In this respondent's experience, the clinic workers encouraged women to tell their
husbands before they use family planning. She and her friends thought this was sound
advice that would help make their marriages stronger. This woman's survey responses
in 1998 reflected the same sentiment: she said that she could not do anything if her
husband refused to let her use family planning and that she would not use family
planning secretly.
Women also told stories about seeking help in the negotiation process. In the
narrative of Angela, a woman from the southern site, a family planning advisor visited
her and her husband. This advisor helped them to come to the decision as a couple to
use family planning:
I started family planning in October last year ...[My husband] gave me
permission. The family planning advisor had come to ask him what he thinks
about family planning. And, the advisor said we were grown people and why
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 163
couldn't we stop [having children]. We discussed until my husband thought that
it was indeed better that I should rest from giving birth. ...And the advisor gave
me a letter and I went to family planning clinic (9006, South 2000).
Angela felt that she had to get her husband's permission before using family planning.
She said, "It is not right just to go without getting permission. But if he accepts, [you
can use it]" (9006, South 2000). It also seems that the family planning advisor required
her to discuss this matter with her husband before s/he would send Angela to the clinic
with a letter for family planning. Despite the input of the advisor, the original idea and
impetus for the conversation was Angela's. When asked who brought up the issue,
Angela said, "It was me. [My husband] did not say anything. He just accepted" (9006,
South 2000). In this case, Angela brought up the topic but relied on the outside
influence of the clinic advisor to negotiate the particulars of the decision with her
husband. Interestingly, in 1998, Angela reported that, although she would not use
family planning secretly and did not feel she could get her way if she wanted to stop
childbearing, she did feel as if she could do something if her husband refused to let her
use family planning. She also felt that she could get her way if she wanted to space her
births. Here we learn that the "something" she could do to get her way in such a
situation was to involve an outsider to help negotiate.
It becomes clear through the qualitative data that negotiations about family
planning use are not straightforward, but are likely to be multi-faceted and complex.
The qualitative data largely support the general findings of the quantitative data on
family planning decision-making. Both data sources show that women often feel that
they can do something if they want to use family planning--e.g., enlist the help of
outsiders. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative data support certain differences.
They include that women in the southern site feel empowered to make decisions about
both spacing births and stopping childbearing, whereas women in the northern site are
more likely to claim a right to making decisions about spacing than about stopping.
Finally, both data sources support the idea that secret use is a real and viable choice for
many, but not all, women when other strategies do not work. Each data source has one
advantage that the other does not. The qualitative data complement and supplement the
quantitative data by providing narratives of the processes by which certain decisions are
made. The narratives illuminate the multi-staged, often protracted, negotiations between
spouses as well as the negotiations that involve other participants who influence
decisions about family planning use. The quantitative data facilitate examining
correlations between those concepts and reproductive behavior at the aggregate level,
which is difficult to accomplish with the qualitative data alone.

6. Conclusions: using qualitative data to ask better quantitative
questions
Demographers are interested in modeling the relationship between women's situation
and fertility-related behavior. Current demographic research attempts to measure
women's situation by quantifying concepts such as status, autonomy, and
empowerment. Transforming these abstract concepts into concrete survey questions
with quantifiable responses is perhaps the most daunting task before demographers.
Ethnographic data are an underused resource. By nesting the GCS qualitative work in
survey research, I retained the breadth and generalizability of the Malawi 1 survey data,
but gained rich nuanced information about gender and context in rural Malawi. In my
case study, the qualitative data supplement, but do not replace, the quantitative results. I
have shown that one can use the qualitative data to compare findings, contextualize
results, and help to conceptualize women's situation in the rural Malawian context.
The Malawi 1 survey questions, to be useful for statistical analysis, necessarily
constrained the type and number of responses that a respondent could give to a
question. In the semi-structured interviews, however, respondents were able to talk
freely about the Malawi 1 survey gender module topics as well as about a number of
other issues associated with the local gender context. The respondents could emphasize
the aspects of those subjects that were most relevant to their own lives rather than have
the quantitative researcher presuppose appropriate measures of women's status,
autonomy, and power. Although not the only goal, the qualitative data can help
demographers to find ways in which to improve the survey instrument in future
iterations.
Throughout this paper, I have referred to a few ways in which the gender module
of the Malawi 1 survey could be improved. The concept of women's freedom of
movement in the Malawian settings would be better-specified in two ways. First, to
control for differences in community layout and kin structure, there should be
additional questions that measure the distance to the market/health center and kin's
ability to monitor women's mobility. Second, the questions should refer to the last time
the respondent went to the market/health center and should ask for the factors that led to
the decision to ask permission or not; these should replace the more-generic questions
that were asked in 1998.
Adding questions about women's situation to men's questionnaires is another way
to improve what we can learn from survey data. This may be in the form of asking men
about their opinions of women's behavior and gender norms. It can also extend to
asking men about their own behavior - e.g., their freedom of movement - to serve as a
ruler against which to measure women's comparative status, autonomy, and
empowerment.
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 165
The family planning decision-making survey questions seemed to parallel what we
learned through the qualitative narratives. One improvement to these questions,
however, would be to somehow include other possible sources of influence and
intervention in the decision-making process, recognizing that men and women do not
make these decisions in a vacuum. It is important to recognize the limitation of the
scope of these questions and to continue to collect qualitative narratives to contextualize
and complement them.
Another important issue that the qualitative data raised that I have yet to discuss
has to do with questions that allowed for respondent interpretation of meaning. For
example, the qualitative data revealed that responses to at least one of the divorce
questions may have depended on how respondents interpreted the question. In 1998,
only about a quarter of the women reported that it was permissible to leave a man who
did not support his family financially (see Table 2 above). Nevertheless, nearly all of
the female, and many of the male, respondents mentioned this reason for divorce
spontaneously during the in-depth interviews in 2000. The difference may have
reflected interpretation. In 2000, women said they would tolerate a man who actively
sought an income, but found none, but that a man who squandered the family's money
on beer and girlfriends could be divorced. It is unclear whether all respondents
understood this question in the same way in 1998. To be sure that all respondents
interpret such a question in the same way in the future, it may be better to ask a series of
questions: 1) Can a woman divorce a husband who is unable to find an income? 2) Can
a woman divorce a husband who has squandered the family's money on beer? Finally,
3) Can a woman divorce a husband who has squandered the family's money on
girlfriends?
Although not the focus of this paper, one way in which qualitative data can
improve the survey is by adding new questions on emergent themes--inductive
qualitative inquiry can reveal new topics of research on women's situation. These open-
ended responses from narratives can lead researchers to unanticipated answers,
understanding, and further questions. The qualitative data may also illuminate concepts
and areas of women's situation that are too complex to be measured by fixed-answer
survey questions. Moreover, they may shed light on new topics associated with
women's situation that will better-capture this concept and its relationship to
reproductive health outcomes.
It is crucial for demographers to use qualitative data to improve the quantitative
instrument rather than as a stand-alone data source. Just as the quantitative data may be
insufficient in certain areas, qualitative data alone cannot answer demographers'
questions about women's situation and its relationship to fertility behavior. Although
qualitative data provide a more-nuanced picture of women's situation, and may even be
"more accurate" in certain ways than the quantitative data, qualitative data are also
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
166 http://www.demographic-research.org
somewhat intractable. It is much-more difficult to try to correlate qualitative measures
of autonomy to reproductive outcomes than to do so with survey data. In addition, the
small "n" of qualitative data does limit the macro-level processes one can explore.
Thus, to get a full, rich picture of women's situation and its relationship to reproductive
behavior, it is necessary to integrate the two data sources while recognizing the
weaknesses and exploiting the strengths of each.

I am grateful to Susan Watkins and Eliya Zulu for making me a part of the Malawi
Diffusion and Ideational Change Project and for allowing me to use the Malawi 1
survey data. I am indebted to my qualitative field team in Malawi for their collection of
high-quality data. I have benefited from comments on earlier drafts of this paper from
Shelly Clark, Kathryn Edin, Loren Landau, Nancy Luke, Rebecca Joyce Kissane,
Herbert Smith, Susan Watkins, and Linda West.

Notes
1. For more information on the 1998 MDICP survey--sampling, data collection, and
map--see Watkins et al. in this volume, and
www.pop.upenn.edu/Social_Networks/; also see Schatz 2002.
2. The omitted site in the central region, Mchinji, is less-easily categorized in terms
of lineage and residence than the other two sites. Historically, the Chewa, the
ethnic majority in the central region's site, were matrilineal and matrilocal, but,
over time, the lineage and residence patterns have become less rigid. Because one
focus of my field research was to compare how social systems mediate the
relationship between women's situation and demographic outcomes, the North-
South comparison was more salient. In Schatz 2002, I show the problems inherent
in these concepts and the dichotomies between them.
3. Principal Investigator: Enid Schatz. The Mellon Center Grant to the University of
Pennsylvania for Training and Research in Developing Countries funded the pilot
study in 1999. Two sources supported the larger study conducted in 2000: an
extension of the Mellon grant and partial support from National Institute of Health
grant RO1 HD37276-01 on "Social Interactions and Reproductive Health," Susan
Watkins and Jere Behrman principal investigators.
4. I interviewed only the sampled wife and her husband in polygynous unions. Each
widowed or divorced woman counts as a "couple."
5. In the table, all of the variables are measured as reported in 1998. For several
couples, one of the following changed between 1998 and 2000: marital status,
marriage type, or residence. See Schatz 2002 for details on these changes.
6. In 2000, only one respondent refused to be interviewed. More frequently, however,
I could not find respondents because they had moved or because I could not trace
them with the names they gave to MDICP in 1998. When I could not find a couple
or interview them for some reason, I replaced that couple with another couple that
was as similar as possible in terms of age, marital status, marriage type, lineage,
and residence.
7. In the southern site, the team included the following interviewers: McDaphton
Bellos, Davie Chitenje, Fanizo George, Hazrat Hassan, Esnat Sanudi, and
Rosemary Sapangwa. In addition, Matthews Howard helped with transcription. In
the northern site, the team included Harry Mkamanga (field supervisor), Praise
Chatonda, Bertha Kalua, Jenala Kayira, Enala Mnthali, Ziveza Nkana, Joseph
Nyirenda, Kenneth Nyirenda, and Jones Shange. The teams conducted all of the
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 5
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --

interviews in the local languages (chiYao or chiChewa in the South--depending on
the ethnic group and native language of the respondent--and chiTumbuka in the
North) and taped the interviews on audiocassettes. The first interviews lasted
between 45 and 150 minutes, depending on the interviewer and respondent. The
second-round interviews were generally shorter than the first-round interviews.
Whenever possible, the interviewers translated and transcribed the interviews they
had conducted themselves. By transcribing their own interviews, they could add
notes about what was happening at different points during the interview as well as
write notes in the transcript explaining what a respondent was talking about in a
situation where the respondent left a sentence unfinished or used an idiom. On
average, it took each interviewer two-to-three days to completely translate and
transcribe each interview into English. I went over each transcript with the
interviewer who transcribed it. These transcriptions were later typed and analyzed
using NVIVO qualitative analysis software.
8. I attempted to conduct interviews through a translator during my pilot study and
found that the resulting interviews were choppy and had major gaps because
responses were summarized by the translator and because of subsequent
insufficient probing.
9. For a discussion of the training of local interviewers, see Schatz 2002.
10. Table 3 shows Malawi 1 statistics for the southern and northern sites as well as
combined results from the two sites. In Table 3, CEB=children ever born,
H=Husband, FP=family planning. A similar table for male GCS and Malawi 1
respondents can be found in Schatz 2002. The male comparison is also marked by
more similarities than differences between the two sample populations.
11. Respondents' names have been changed. The numbers after the quotations refer to
the respondent's identification number in the Malawi 1 survey.
12. While MDICP was in the field in 1998, the project rented two Land Rovers to
which the team had access. When I returned to conduct my own project, renting a
vehicle (and driver) was too expensive, so I commuted from my hotel to the field
using "local transport"; this experience gave me a chance to talk to a lot of locals as
well as to get a better feel for the area.
13. In retrospect, the MDICP principal investigators claim that directing the "gender
questions" toward female respondents only was an oversight, not a purposeful
strategy.

questions, see Ghuman, Lee and Smith 2001.
15. The Malawi 1 questionnaire did include questions about whom one talked to about
family planning, although not specifically about who influenced them. These
questions have been statistically tested to show that network partners influence
family planning behavior (Behrman, Kohler and Watkins, 2002a, 2002b; Kohler,
Behrman and Watkins, 2001).
