Abstract
Objective: To determine the correlation between anatomical features of the upper airway
(evaluated via computed tomography imaging) and the ease of light wand-assisted endotracheal
intubation in patients undergoing ear, nose and throat surgery under general anaesthesia.
Methods: Mallampati class, laryngoscopic grade, thyromental distance, neck circumference, body
mass index, mouth opening and upper lip bite class were assessed. Epiglottis length and angle,
tongue size and narrowest pharyngeal distance were determined using computed tomography
imaging. Intubation success rate, time to successful intubation (intubating time) and postoperative
throat symptoms were documented.
Results: Of 152 patients, 148 (97.4%) were successfully intubated on the first attempt (mean
intubating time 11.5 Æ 6.7 s). Intubating time was positively correlated with laryngoscopic grade
and body mass index in both male and female patients, and Mallampati class and neck
circumference in male patients. Epiglottis length was positively correlated with intubating time.
Conclusions: Ease of intubation was influenced by epiglottis length. Radiological evaluation may
be useful for preoperative assessment of patients undergoing endotracheal intubation with light
wand.

apparently normal individuals,1 particularly
in unprepared patients or those requiring
emergency intubation.2 There is currently no
method of airway assessment that can
reliably predict difficult laryngoscopic intub-
ation, however.3,4
Blind oral tracheal intubation using the
transillumination technique with a light
wand is simple, rapid and effective;5,6 it
also results in fewer dental injuries than
endotracheal intubation.3 This approach
does not require visualization of the vocal
cords and is particularly useful in patients
with difficult airways, whether the difficulty
was anticipated or not.7­10 In patients with
high Mallampati class, a light wand was
found to have a higher rate of intubation
success and shorter intubating time than
direct laryngoscopic intubation.8 The light
wand is useful in cases of limited cervical
motion, and may be an alternative to
fibreoptic bronchoscopic intubation.9,10
Although light wand-guided intubation can
be performed quickly and easily, the failure
rate for a first intubation attempt is 28%;4 it
should thus be avoided in patients with
known abnormalities of the upper airway.11
It is unclear whether airway param-
eters that predict difficult laryngoscopic
intubation can also be applied to light
wand intubation. In the case of light wand
intubation, obesity (body mass index
[BMI] ! 30kg/m2) and Mallampati class III
airway have been shown to predict pro-
longed intubating time in patients with no
known airway abnormalities.12 There was
no apparent correlation between the laryn-
goscopic view and either orotracheal intub-
ation13 or nasotracheal intubation success
rate, however.14
Epiglottis length and tongue size (both
measured radiologically) are used to predict
difficulties in fibreoptic orotracheal intub-
ation,15 and may also be relevant to light
wand intubation.16 There are no studies that
have investigated which airway anatomical
features are associated with difficulties in
light wand intubation in adults, however.
The aim of the present study was to deter-
mine the correlation between anatomical
features of the upper airway (evaluated via
computed tomography [CT] imaging) and
the ease of light wand intubation in patients
undergoing ear, nose and throat (ENT)
surgery under general anaesthesia.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited adult patients (aged !20
years) with American Society of Anesthesiolo-
gists physical status I or II (https://www.asahq.
org/resources/clinical-information/asa-physical
-status-classification-system), who were sched-
uled to undergo ENT surgery with endotra-
cheal intubation at the Department of
Anaesthesiology and Pain Medicine,
Uijeongbu St Mary's Hospital College of
Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea,
Seoul, Republic of Korea, between October
2012 and February 2014. Exclusion criteria
were: known upper airway abnormalities
(tumours, polyps, infections); history of neck
surgery; morbid obesity (BMI ! 35kg/m2);
significant cardiorespiratory disease.
The ethics committee of Uijeongbu
St Mary's Hospital College of Medicine,
The Catholic University of Korea approved
the study; and all patients provided written
informed consent prior to enrolment.
Study parameters
The airway was evaluated at the preopera-
tive visit, and the following parameters were
recorded: modified Mallampati class with
the patient's mouth wide open, head slightly
extended and tongue maximally forward
with phonation in the sitting position;17
mouth opening (distance between first inci-
sors, with mouth fully opened); thyromental
distance (distance between thyroid notch
and lower border of the mandibular
mentum, with head fully extended); neck
Kim et al. 137
circumference at thyroid notch level; any
neck motion limitation.
The upper lip bite test was performed and
classified as: I (lower incisors can bite the
upper lip above the vermilion line); II (lower
incisors can bite the upper lip below the
vermilion line); III (lower incisors cannot
bite the upper lip).18 Patient age, sex, height,
weight and BMI were recorded.
Patients were stratified into groups accord-
ing to the following criteria: BMI (<25kg/m2,
!25kg/m2 to <30kg/m2, !30kg/m2); neck
circumference (<40cm, ! 40cm); Mallampati
class (I, II, III); laryngoscopic grade (1, 2, 3,
4); upper lip bite class (I, II, III). Overweight
and obesity were classified according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
definition (http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/
adult/defining.html).
All patients underwent routine preopera-
tive CT scanning of the paranasal sinus or
scout film of the temporal bone. CT scans
were analysed by one investigator, blinded
to possible intubation difficulties. Epiglottis
length (tip of epiglottis to vallecula), tongue
length (tip of tongue to vallecula), tongue
height (from length line to highest portion of
the tongue) and pharyngeal gap (narrowest
pharyngeal dimension defined anteriorly by
the posterior wall of the epiglottis and
posteriorly by the posterior pharyngeal
wall) were measured digitally on soft
copies of scout views of temporal bone CT
or sagittal views of paranasal sinus CT.
Epiglottic angle was described as the angle
between the perpendicular line subtended
from the vallecula and the line subtended
from the posterior wall of the epiglottis.
Tongue size was calculated as its
length Â height (Figure 1).
Anaesthesia and intubation
None of the patients received premedica-
tion. Routine monitoring included electro-
cardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure and
pulse oximetry. Patients were placed in the
sniffing position with a 10-cm pillow under
the head. Anaesthesia was induced with 2mg/
kg propofol and 1.0­1.5 lg/kg fentanyl, after
preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 min.
After loss of eyelash reflex, 0.6mg/kg rocur-
onium was administered intravenously. The
lungs were manually ventilated by face mask
with 3­4% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen, with
fresh gas flow of 6l/min.
After muscle relaxation, laryngoscopy
grade was determined in all patients via
direct laryngoscopy using a Macintosh no. 3
blade. Laryngeal view was graded without
external laryngeal pressure according to
the Cormack classification as: grade I (com-
plete visualization of the vocal cords);
grade II (visualization of the inferior portion
of the glottis); grade III (visualization of
the epiglottis only); grade IV (inability to
visualize the epiglottis).19 Patients were
ventilated by mask for 1 min after assessing
laryngoscopic view in order to prevent
hypoxaemia.
An experienced anaesthetist (J.K.) who
was blinded to patients' radiological meas-
urements performed all tracheal intubations
using a well-lubricated endotracheal tube
placed over a light wand (Surch-liteTM;
Aaron Medical, St Petersberg, FL, USA).
The light source was placed at the level of
the endotracheal tube tip, and the distal end
of the wand and covering tube were bent to
90  at 7cm from the tip.20 A size 7 endotra-
cheal tube was used for women and a size 8
tube for men, regardless of body weight.
Operating room lights were dimmed during
intubation to assist visualization of trans-
illumination. The jaw was lifted forwards
with the left hand of the intubating anaes-
thetist, and the light wand and tube were
passed down the midline of the tongue using
the right hand. The cuff of the endotracheal
tube was then inflated with air and intub-
ation was confirmed by both auscultation of
breath sounds and detection of carbon
dioxide by the capnograph. All patients
were mechanically ventilated with 2­3%
138 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)
sevoflurane in air/oxygen and received con-
tinuous remifentanil infusion.
The time to intubation (intubating time)
and numbers of attempts and failures were
recorded. Intubating time was defined as
the interval from the device touching the
patient's lip to complete unthreading of the
light wand. A maximum of two attempts,
each lasting 30s, was allowed; the 30-s time
limit was adopted because intubation using
light wand is successful within 30s in 95% of
patients.7,8,12 Patients were ventilated with
100% oxygen by mask between intubation
attempts. If tracheal intubation was unsuc-
cessful after two attempts, intubation was
achieved using conventional laryngoscopy.
Postoperative assessment
The presence and severity of sore throat,
hoarseness and dysphagia were assessed at
18­24h postoperatively. Symptom grading
was: sore throat (0, none; 1, less severe than
with a cold; 2, like a cold; 3, more severe
than with a cold); hoarseness (0, none; 1,
noticed by patient; 2, obvious to observer; 3,
aphonia); dysphagia (0, none; 1, painful
with certain foods; 2, painful with all food
and drink; 3, unable to swallow own secre-
tions).21 All complications were recorded.
Statistical analyses
The sample size calculation was based on the
difference in intubating time (26.4 Æ 12.1s)
in a pilot study of 12 patients (unpublished
data). We assumed that the difference in
intubating time was clinically significant if
>5.5s. Power analysis indicated that a
sample size of 76 patients in each group
should be adequate to detect a difference
between the two groups, with a two-sided

Data were presented as meanÆSD or n
(%) of patients. Demographic data were
analysed using an independent samples
t-test, and radiological measurements in
relation to intubating time were compared
using univariate linear regression analysis.
The correlation between Mallampati class
and laryngoscopic grade was analysed by
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
Intubating times within groups were ana-
lysed using Kruskal­Wallis one-way ana-
lysis of variance on ranks, and intubating
times for each variable were analysed using
Pearson's and Spearman's rank correlation
coefficients. The incidence and severity of
sore throat were analysed using the Mann­
Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. All
statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
The study enrolled 153 patients, one of
whom was excluded following cancellation
of surgery. The final analysis therefore
included 152 (107 male/45 female; mean
age 42.3 Æ 12.5 years; age range 20­65
years). Demographic and anatomical data
for the patients are shown in Table 1.
The 30-s time limit for intubating was
exceeded in two patients, and oesophageal
intubation occurred in two patients; all four of
these patients were successfully intubated on
the second attempt. Three of the four patients
were overweight/obese (i.e., BMI! 25kg/m2).
First-attempt and overall tracheal intubation
success rates were 148/152 (97.4%) and 152/
152 (100%), respectively. Mean time to suc-
cessful intubation on the first attempt and
overall intubating time were 11.5Æ 6.7s and
12.4Æ 8.7s, respectively.
There was a statistically significant rela-
tionship between laryngoscopic grade and
Mallampati class (P < 0.0001; Table 2).

Data regarding intubating time in the
patient groups stratified according to BMI,
neck circumference, Mallampati class and
laryngoscopic grade are shown in Table 3.
Intubating time was significantly longer with
increasing laryngoscopic grade, Mallampati
class, BMI and neck circumference (P < 0.05
for each comparison; Table 3).
Data regarding the association between
intubating time and radiologically assessed
anatomical features of the upper airway are
depicted in Table 4. There was a significant
positive correlation between epiglottis length
and intubating time (b ¼ 0.488 Æ 0.198,
P ¼ 0.015). No other parameter was asso-
ciated with intubating time.
Table 5 shows the correlations between
intubating time and anatomical parameters.
There were significant positive correlations
between intubating time and epiglottis
length, laryngoscopic grade, Mallampati
class, BMI and neck circumference in the
total study population, and in male patients
(P < 0.05 for all correlations). In female
patients, there was a significant positive
correlation between laryngoscopic grade
and BMI, and a significant negative correl-
ation between thyromental distance and
intubating time (P < 0.05 for all correl-
ations). There were no correlations between
intubating time and epiglottic angle, tongue
size, pharyngeal gap, mouth opening
or upper lip bite class in the study
population as a whole, or when stratified
according to sex.
There were no correlations between intu-
bating time and the incidence and severity of
sore throat, hoarseness or dysphagia
(Table 6).
Discussion
Radiological assessment of airway anatom-
ical characteristics determined that epiglot-
tis length was correlated with intubating
time in the present study. Both laryngo-
scopic grade and BMI were correlated with
intubating time in male and female patients,
and there were significant correlations
between intubating time and Mallampati
class and neck circumference in male
patients. Epiglottic angle, tongue size, pha-
ryngeal gap, mouth opening and upper lip
bite class were not associated with intubat-
ing time in male or female patients.
Anaesthetic induction affects muscle
tone, resulting in a degree of upper airway
obstruction ranging from narrowing to
complete obstruction, which may hinder
manoeuvrability of a light wand.22 Use of
a jaw lift (as in the present study) elevates the
epiglottis and enhances the passage of the
intubation tube/light wand.16 It is possible
that a long epiglottis may prevent the free
advancement of the tube into the trachea,
even with the use of a jaw lift. A study of 76

patients undergoing light wand intubation
with jaw lift found that the epiglottis was
deviated in five patients (6.6%) and enfolded
in one (1.3%), even when intubation was
successful.16
Although a long epiglottis significantly
prolonged the time required for successful
intubation in the present study, all of our
patients were successfully intubated, in
accordance with the findings of others.7,8,13
Moreover, there was no correlation between
intubating time and any other radiologically
assessed airway parameter (epiglottic angle,
tongue size and pharyngeal gap) in the
present study. We performed CT imaging
with the patients awake and in the supine
position, without jaw lifting. It is therefore
possible that the position of the epiglottis
and tongue in relation to the pharynx, as
revealed by these scans, would differ from
that occurring under general anaesthesia.
However, even in cases where the epiglottis
falls on the posterior pharyngeal wall, the tip
of the light wand can be placed at the glottic
opening when guided from the lateral pos-
terior side through the piriform fossa.5 Our
findings are in accordance with others who
showed that, in contrast to laryngoscopy,
the ease of light wand-assisted intubation
did not appear to be influenced by anatom-
ical variations in the upper airway.3 In a
study of 265 patients who experienced diffi-
cult intubation, all patients were successfully
intubated using a light wand.7

The Cormack and Lehane classification
of laryngoscopic view is frequently used
to predict a difficult laryngoscopy.19
Intubating time was longer in patients with
high laryngoscopic grade in the present
study, regardless of sex. Other studies have
found no correlation between high laryngo-
scopic grade and orotracheal intubation13 or
nasotracheal intubation success rates.14
These studies placed the patient's head and
neck in a neutral or relatively extended
position, in contrast to the present study
where the head was placed in the sniff
position with jaw lift. In a sniff position,
the epiglottis is almost in contact with the
posterior pharyngeal wall, making it difficult
for the light wand to pass underneath the
epiglottis.11 The discrepancy between these
studies and our study may, in part, be
accounted for by the different head position
during the intubation.
Mallampati class was significantly corre-
lated with intubating time in the present
study. This finding is in accordance with
others, who reported that Mallampati class
is a good indicator of ease of light wand
intubation in patients without known
airway abnormality.12 In contrast, a further
study reported no correlation between
Mallampati class and ease of light wand
intubation in patients without known or
potential problems relating to intubation.3
Mallampati class is a valuable estimate of
tongue size relative to the capacity of the
oropharynx,23 and was modified to reliably
predict difficult laryngoscopy with the
patient sitting, head in extension, tongue
out and with phonation.17 Differences in the
methods used to assess Mallampati class
may explain the discrepancies between dif-
ferent study findings. Alternatively, these
differences may be due to variation in the
definition of intubating time. The present
study defined the beginning of intubation as
the moment when the device touched the
patient's lip, whereas Hung et al3 used the

point when the device was inserted into the
hypopharynx ­ this may have meant that the
time-consuming part of intubation in patients
with a large tongue was excluded, resulting in
a similar intubation time in patients with or
without hindrance from the tongue.
Being overweight or obese (i.e.,
BMI! 25kg/m2) significantly increased intu-
bating time in the present study. In accordance
with our findings, others have noted failure
of light wand-assisted intubation in overweight
or obese patients.3,7,24 Intubation using the
Surch-liteTM requires visualization of a central
bright transillumination glow through the
anterior neck rather than visualization of the
laryngeal structure. Magnetic resonance ima-
ging of fat deposits around the upper airway in
obese patients revealed that these fat deposits
were anterior to the laryngopharyngeal air-
space and in submental regions.25 It is expected,
therefore, that intubating time would be pro-
longed with increasing BMI, because the
increased fat deposits in the neck mask the
light, and thereby increase the time taken to
visualize the transillumination.26 Patients with
severe obesity (BMI!35kg/m2) were therefore
excluded from the present study.
Neck circumference is significantly corre-
lated with visceral abdominal and neck fat.27
Light wand-guided intubation has been
shown to be difficult in obese patients and
in those with short, thick necks.28 These
problems may be overcome by using simple
steps, such as extending the neck by placing a
support under the shoulder, using a brighter
light source, and switching off or dimming
the operating room lights when neces-
sary.6,7,11 Transillumination of the light
wand at the neck can also be enhanced by
adjustment of the bent length or angle of the
light wand against the wall of the trachea.20
Sore throat and hoarseness are common
complaints after laryngoscopy and endotra-
cheal intubation.21 Since light wand-guided
intubation is performed without visualiza-
tion of the laryngeal structures, it would be
expected to result in airway complications
more frequently than laryngoscopic intub-
ation. Sore throat has been shown to occur
less frequently after light wand-guided
intubation than laryngoscopic intubation
(17.1% versus 25.3%), however,3 thus sug-
gesting that the former is less traumatic than
the latter. The incidence of throat discom-
fort was higher in the present study than in
other studies;3 this is because we included
mild degrees of discomfort, most of which
would not have been regarded as true
symptoms in routine practice. The incidence

of more severe symptoms (grade 2/3) in our
study was comparable with the findings of
others.29 We found no relationship between
intubating time and the incidence and sever-
ity of throat discomfort symptoms.
The current study has several limitations.
First, the epiglottis is concave and round but
was measured as a straight line, meaning its
true length may not have been represented.
Secondly, a reduction in light intensity may
affect the success rate of light wand intub-
ation, but we did not adjust the intensity of the
light bulb. Thirdly, we excluded patients with
known upper airway abnormalities because
these are absolute contraindications to the
blind light wand technique.6 As a result, our
findings may not be applicable to patients with
known abnormalities. Finally, all intubations
were performed by a single anaesthetist, and
our data may therefore be biased towards the
expertise of that operator. Patients were
unintentionally sampled so that the likelihood
of a difficult airway was dispersed throughout
the study period, however. In addition, the
anaesthetist was very experienced in light
wand intubation.
In conclusion, the ease of intubation using
a light wand (Surch-liteTM) is influenced by
epiglottis length. In addition, high laryngo-
scopic grade and high BMI in male and female
patients, and high Mallampati class and neck
circumference in male patients, may compli-
cate light wand-guided tracheal intubation.
Radiological evaluation may be useful for
preoperative assessment of patients undergo-
ing endotracheal intubation with light wand.
