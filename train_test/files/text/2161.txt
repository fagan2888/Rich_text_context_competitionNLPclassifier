Introduction
Obesity is one of the most pressing public health problems
today; though it affects all sociodemographic groups, the bur-
den of disease is not equally distributed. Certain racial/ethnic
and gender groups, specifically African-American females
and Hispanic males, have been found to have higher rates of
overweight/obesity relative to their white peers (1­3). When
examined by sexual orientation, obesity has been found to be
higher in lesbian females but lower in gay males when com-
pared to same-gender heterosexuals (4­8). A recent study of
women in California documented that the odds of obesity
in lesbians was three and a half times higher compared to
heterosexual women (9). In contrast, heterosexual men have
been found to have as much as twice the odds of obesity as
gay men (10).
Historically, our understanding of group-level differences in
prevalence of overweight/obesity has derived from surveillance
relyingonself-reportedweightandheightdata.Accuracyofthe
group-level comparisons, therefore, is dependent on the accu-
racy of reporting, and perhaps more importantly, the similar-
ity between groups in over- or underreporting of their weight
and height. However, we know that reporting bias in general
is common (11­13) and that patterns differ by key sociode-
mographic characteristics including race/ethnicity and gender
(14). Little is known, however, about how reporting patterns
compare across sexual orientation groups.
Accuracy in weight reporting has also been shown to differ
by other social and health characteristics and behaviors. These
include level of education (15) and weight status (16). Others
have speculated that the presence or absence of depressive
symptoms and physical activity level may also impact accu-
racy of reporting (16). Because these characteristics are not
equally distributed across different demographic groups, they
may influence and partially explain group-level differences in
weight reporting (4,7,9,17,18)
The primary goal of this study was to address the gap in the
literature related to the accuracy of BMI based on self-reported
height and weight among different sexual orientation groups.
As a secondary goal, we sought to understand the potential
modifying influence of weight status on the reporting by sexual
orientation groups and the potential confounding by physical
activity, education, and depressive symptoms. We specifically
set out to determine (i) Are there differences in accuracy of
BMI calculated from self-reported weight and height (referred
to as self-reported BMI) by sexual orientation group? (ii) If so,
are the differences in accuracy of self-reported BMI by sexual
orientation modified by weight status and partially explained
by socioeconomic status, physical activity level, and depressive
Sexual Orientation and Bias in Self-Reported
BMI
Tracy K. Richmond1, Courtney E. Walls2 and S. Bryn Austin1
Our objective was to determine if sexual orientation groups differ in accuracy of BMI (kg/m2) calculated from self-
reported height and weight and if weight status modifies possible differences. Using gender-stratified multiple linear
regression to analyze Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 12,197), we examined
the association of sexual orientation with BMI calculated from self-reported height and weight (self-reported BMI),
controlling for BMI calculated from objectively measured height and weight (objectively measured BMI) as well as
demographic, health, and behavioral variables. We tested for effect modification of the relationship between sexual
orientation and self-reported BMI by objectively measured BMI. The population underestimated their BMI (females:
 = 0.87, P < 0.001; males = 0.86, P < 0.001). Sexual orientation groups differed little in their accuracy of reporting;
only gay males had significant underreporting ( = -0.37, P = 0.038) relative to their heterosexual peers. We found no
evidence of effect modification of the relationship of sexual orientation and self-reported BMI by objectively measured
BMI. With the exception of gay males, sexual orientation groups are consistent in their underreporting of BMI thus
providing confidence in most comparisons of weight status based on self-report. Self-reporting of weight and height
by gay males may exaggerate the differences in BMI between gay and heterosexual males.

symptoms? Given the literature on differences by sexual ori-
entation and gender in weight satisfaction and body image
(18­22), we hypothesized that lesbian women would be less
likely and gay men more likely to underestimate their BMI than
their same-gender, heterosexual peers. We further hypoth-
esized that depression may lead to more accurate reporting
while overweight status would lead to greater underestimation
of weight. Finally, we anticipated that both lower educational
attainment and lower physical activity levels would lead to less
accurate weight reporting.
Methods and Procedures
Study population
This research uses data from the third of four Waves of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative
school-based study of adolescents enrolled in grades 7 through 12 at
initial recruitment in 1994­1995. Wave III data were collected in 2001­
2002 when respondents were aged 18­26. The primary sampling unit
of the initial wave of the Add Health study is schools. Prior to sampling,
schools were sorted by size, school type, census region, level of urbani-
zation, and the percentage of the student body that is white. Add Health
used systematic sampling methods and implicit stratification to ensure
that the selected schools were representative of US schools. All of the
students attending the chosen schools were eligible for the in-home
sample. Students were stratified by gender and grade in school with
about 17 students randomly selected from each stratum. The final sam-
ple in Wave I was 20,745. Every effort was made to find respondents for
Wave III; of the 20,745 who participated in Wave I, 15,170 completed
the in-home questionnaire for Wave III.
Several exclusion criteria were applied to create our analytic sample. We
excluded those who identified themselves as not attracted to either males
or females as the sample size was small (n = 68), and it was difficult to
interpret the meaning of this category relative to the other sexual orienta-
tion groups. Additionally, we excluded those who were missing sampling
weights as well as those who were missing information either regarding
our dependent variable (self-reported BMI based on self-reported height
and weight) or key independent predictors (total of 978 excluded because
of missing either self-reported BMI or measured BMI). However, prior
to this final exclusion, we addressed a high nonresponse rate (~10%)
for the two variables measuring socioeconomic status--parent-reported
maternal education and household income. In an effort to avoid selec-
tion bias and inaccurate inferences resulting from listwise deletion, we
imputed these variables by using the Gaussian normal regression imputa-
tion method (23,24). After this imputation and all exclusions, our final
sample contained 12,797 adolescents and young adults.
Study variables
Outcome variable. Our primary outcome of interest was BMI calcu-
lated from the participants' self-reported height and weight (referred to
as self-reported BMI).
Primary predictor variables. Our primary predictor variable was BMI
calculated from objectively measured height and weight (referred to as
objectively measured BMI) recorded by field interviewers in a standard
way. Our second predictor of interest was sexual orientation. Partici-
pants were asked to "choose the description that best fits how you think
about yourself," with the following possible responses: (i) 100% het-
erosexual (straight), (ii) mostly heterosexual (straight), but somewhat
attracted to people of your own sex, (iii) bisexual--that is attracted to
men and women equally, (iv) mostly homosexual (gay), but somewhat
attracted to people of the opposite sex, (v) 100% homosexual (gay), and
(vi) not sexually attracted to either males or females. As noted above,
we excluded those who chose option 6 as this category was difficult to
interpret. Additionally, because of small cell sizes we collapsed "mostly
homosexual" (n = 84) and "homosexuals" (n = 113) into a single cat-
egory called "gay/lesbian."
Additional independent variables. Race/ethnicity was constructed
from two questions, one that asked participants to indicate if they were
of Hispanic/Latino origin and a second that asked them to choose a
category of race that best describes them. We constructed six catego-
ries: Hispanic, black or African American (not Hispanic), Asian/Pacific
Islander, white (not Hispanic), Native American/American Indian, and
multiracial/other. Depression score was taken from a modified version
of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and
treated as a continuous variable with a range of 0­26 (25). We elected
to control for socioeconomic markers of the household of origin (i.e.,
Wave I household income and highest educational attainment of
mother/caregiver) in Wave III because of the expected heterogeneity of
professional and/or educational development in Wave III participants
who were ages 18­26 at the time of data collection. Maternal education
was treated as an ordinal variable with four categories (less than high
school; high school or vocational school; some college or trade; and
college and beyond). Maternal report of household income was also
treated as a continuous variable. Due to a high degree of missingness for
the maternal report of household income and maternal education, we
imputed these variables using the Gaussian normal regression imputa-
tion method. Additionally, we controlled for age, gender, and reported
physical activity (taken from seven different questions asking the num-
ber of times in the last 7 days participated in different groups of activi-
ties) treated as a continuous variable with values ranging from 0­49.
Analyses
All analyses were performed using STATA/SE 10.0. In all models,
we accounted for the complex survey design using svy commands in
STATA and applied weights to account for the unequal likelihood of
being sampled for certain subpopulations. We performed bivariate
analyses of our covariates of interest with our outcome variable to test
for significant relationships. We then used multiple linear regression to
test for bias in weight status reporting among different sexual orienta-
tion groups accounting for objectively measured BMI. We show our
model-building strategy starting with a model only controlling for our
primary predictor variables, objectively measured BMI, and sexual ori-
entation group (Model A), then a fully controlled model (Model B).
Regression diagnostic procedures showed no evidence of multicolline-
arity, heteroscedasticity, or substantial influence from outliers.
We tested for effect modification of the association of sexual orienta-
tion group and self-reported BMI by weight status. Specifically, we tested
for improvement of fit of our model with the inclusion of the interaction
terms measured BMI × sexual orientation group using a global test, gen-
eralized linear hypothesis testing. We compared the -2* log likelihood
ratios of models with and without the interaction terms. Because of our a
priori hypotheses regarding differences by gender within sexual orienta-
tion groups, we performed all analyses stratified by gender.
In order to assess for the potential influence of over- or underreport-
ing of either height or weight, we did sensitivity analyses with height and
weight as separate outcomes.
Results
Sexual orientation groups differed on several of our variables of
interest (Table 1). Gay (average BMI = 25.2) and bisexual males
(average BMI = 24.5) had on average lower measured BMIs
compared to those of male heterosexuals (average BMI = 26.4)
whereas bisexual females (average BMI = 28.7) and lesbians
(average BMI = 26.8) had on average higher BMIs compared
to heterosexual females (average BMI = 26.3). The depres-
sion score was lower in the heterosexual males and females
compared to all other same sex sexual orientation groups.
Gay males and lesbians had the highest reported physical

activity levels across sexual orientation groups. Heterosexual
and mostly heterosexual males and females were more likely to
have mothers with some college education compared to homo-
sexual males and females.
Tables 2 and 3 present results from our partially and fully
adjusted multiple linear regression models examining the
association of sexual orientation groups and BMI calculated
from self-reported height and weight taking into account
objectively measured BMI. We tested for improvement of fit
of our models with the addition of interaction terms sexual
orientation group × objectively measured BMI. Though our
generalized linear hypothesis testing indicated improve-
ment in the overall fit of our model with the addition of
these interaction terms, none of the individual interaction
terms were significant. Results of models with the interac-
tion terms therefore are not presented.

Forfemales,inthefullyadjustedmodel,weseethatwithevery
one-unit increase in measured BMI, there is a 0.87 increase in
self-reported BMI indicating that on average females under-
reported their BMI by 13%. There was no significant difference
by sexual orientation group in amount of underreporting of
BMI. We also see that there is a slight increase in self-reported
BMI ( = 0.02) resulting in improved accuracy with increasing
depression score; in contrast, there is a modest decrease in self-
reported BMI with increase in physical activity ( = -0.02).
There is also a slight decrease in self-reported BMI with an
increase in maternal education ( = -0.07) but no significant
difference related to household income.
Findings in males are overall similar to those in females.
In males, the intercept in the fully adjusted model is approxi-
mately one BMI unit lower than the model not fully adjusted.
In the fully adjusted model, with every one-unit increase in
measured BMI, there is an average increase in self-reported
BMI of 0.85 BMI units indicating that on average males under-
report their BMI by 15%. In addition, gay males on average
report a BMI 0.37 units lower than heterosexual males of the
same BMI, indicating that gay males underreport their BMI
to a greater degree than do heterosexual males. There are no
other significant differences by sexual orientation group. As in
females, there is a modest increase in reported BMI with an
increase in depression score ( = 0.02), resulting in improved
accuracy. However, in males, there is no association between
physical activity level nor marker of socioeconomic status and
self-reported BMI.
In Figures 1 and 2, we show prototypical plots of the self-re-
ported BMI vs. measured BMI for the different gender-specific
sexual orientation groups. In both figures, we see that there is
an overall underreporting of BMI across the population and
that at the absolute value of underreporting is higher at higher
BMIs. In the gender-specific sexual orientation groups, we see
an overall underreporting of BMI but a great degree of similar-
ity between the groups.
In order to assess for undue influence of over- or underre-
porting on either height or weight, we examined models with
height and weight as separate outcomes (see Tables 1 and 2

in Supplementary Appendix online). In females, bisexual
females overreported their weight relative to their hetero-
sexual peers ( = 1.94, P = 0.047) as did black females rela-
tive to their white peers ( = 1.41, P = 0.033). Both black ( =
-0.15, P = 0.011) and Hispanic ( = -0.23, P = 0.022) females
underreported their height relative to their white peers. In
males, Hispanics and Asians underreported both their height
(Hispanics:  = -0.36, P < 0.001; Asians:  = -0.43, P < 0.001)
and weight (Hispanics:  = -1.32, P < 0.001; Asians:  = -0.43,
P < 0.001) relative to their white peers. Blacks both overre-
ported their weight ( = 1.07, P = 0.23) and underreported
their height ( = -0.25, P < 0.001) relative to whites. In males,
there were no statistically significant differences in accuracy of
reporting height or weight by sexual orientation group thought
all had underreporting of weight and overreporting of height
relative to their heterosexual peers.
Discussion
In this nationally representative sample of 18- to 26-year-old
males and females, we found few differences in reporting
of BMI between gender-specific sexual orientation minor-
ity groups and same-gender heterosexuals. Counter to our
hypotheses, lesbians did not underreport their BMI to a lesser
degree than heterosexual females, but consistent with our
hypotheses, gay males showed greater reporting bias than did
heterosexual males. Specifically, gay males were the only group
who underreported their BMI to a greater degree than same-
gender heterosexuals. Similar trends were found in other male
sexual orientation groups when looking at height and weight
separately though no statistically significant associations were
noted. However, it is notable that there was significant under-
reporting of BMI by all groups and that the absolute value
of underreporting increased with increasing measured BMI.
This is the first study of which we are aware to examine sexual

orientation-related bias in self-reported BMI.
It is worth noting that groups differed in under- and overre-
porting of height and weight. Specifically, all male racial/ethnic
groups with the exception of the multiracial males underre-
ported their height relative to whites. Also, Hispanic and
Asian males significantly underreported their weight relative
to whites. However, when examining BMI, only black males
differed significantly in their reporting accuracy relative to
whites. In females, the patterns for height and weight reporting
were similar for height and weight when compared to BMI.
Current evidence from the literature based on self-report
data has documented elevated obesity in sexual minority
females and reduced obesity in sexual minority males relative
to same-gender heterosexual peers (4­8). Our findings among
females based on objectively measured and self-report BMI
indicate that these observed sexual orientation disparities can-
not be explained by orientation-related bias in self-reported
BMI. Among males, while a greater degree of underreporting
of BMI among gay males may lead to overestimates of orienta-
tion-related obesity disparities, in our study, group differences
persisted even when BMI was objectively measured, provid-
ing further evidence that heterosexual males are at greater risk
for elevated BMI than are gay males despite the presence of
reporting bias.
Though certain sociodemographic factors such as gender
have been shown to be associated with the accuracy of weight
reporting (16,26­28), there has been less information about
the impact of other behavioral and health factors. In their
review of the accuracy of self-reported weight in adolescents,
Sherry et al. called for further studies to investigate the influ-
ence of physical activity, socioeconomic status, and mental
health status on accuracy of weight reporting (16). In our
analysis of females, we found a modest influence by all three
(depression score, physical activity, and maternal education)
on self-reported BMI; in males, we found only depression to be
significantly associated with self-reported BMI.

There are limitations to this study that should be noted. First,
we were limited in our BMI data by the equipment used; per-
sons weighing more than 400 pounds could not be weighed by
the scales used. Thus, if there were different patterns occurring
on the high-end extreme of weight status, we would be unable
to capture them. Second, participants were aware that they
would be weighed so may have been more accurate in their
reporting than if they had not known that objective measure-
mentswouldbetaken.Finally,sexualorientationwasdiscerned
by a single item assessing sexual orientation identity. In public
health research, sexual orientation is typically understood to be
multidimensional construct makeup of three primary dimen-
sions: (i) attractions, (ii) sex of sexual partners, and (3) iden-
tity labeling as heterosexual, bisexual, or lesbian/gay (29,30).
Associations between sexual orientation and health have been
found to differ by the dimension measured (31).
Conclusions
Understanding both the overall accuracy of self-reported BMI
and the relative accuracy between groups is key to determining
how to allocate often scarce public health intervention dollars.
Because reliance on self-reported data is common, especially in
large state-run surveys such as the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (32)
and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (33), it is all the
more important to understand the accuracy of these data. Our
findings are reassuring that in most cases the relative accuracy
of self-reported BMI is similar across sexual orientation groups.
Thus, targeting specific sexual orientation groups for interven-
tion based on self-reported weight status data is reasonable espe-
cially when obtaining measured data are not feasible.
Obesity disparities have been identified as among the most
critical public health problems facing the nation, and research
into the causes of racial/ethnic and gender disparities in obes-
ity is receiving increasing scholarly attention (1,34). Sexual
orientation-related disparities in obesity have now been con-
sistently documented across samples and, importantly, our
study indicates that observed disparities are robust and cannot
be attributed to reporting bias. It is now time for researchers
focused on health disparities and obesity to devote concerted
efforts to identifying the causes of these disparities, which will
provide us with the scientific knowledge essential to designing
effective interventions to eliminate sexual orientation-related
disparities in obesity.
