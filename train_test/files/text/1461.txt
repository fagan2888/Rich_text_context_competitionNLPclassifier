OBJECTIVE -- We examined potential mediators of the reported association between dia-
betes and hearing impairment.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Data come from 1,508 participants, aged
40­69 years, who completed audiometric testing during 1999­2004 in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We defined hearing impairment as the pure-tone
average 25 decibels hearing level of pure-tone thresholds at low/mid (500, 1,000, and 2,000
Hz) and high (3,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 Hz) frequencies. Using logistic regression, we
examined whether controlling for vascular or neuropathic conditions, cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, glycemia, or inflammation diminished the association between diabetes and hearing
impairment.
RESULTS -- Diabetes was associated with a 100% increased odds of low/mid-frequency
hearing impairment (odds ratio 2.03 [95% CI 1.32­3.10]) and a 67% increased odds of high-
frequency hearing impairment (1.67 [1.14­2.44]) in preliminary models after controlling for
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and occupational noise exposure. Adjusting for
peripheral neuropathy attenuated the association with low/mid-frequency hearing impairment
(1.70 [1.02­2.82]). Adjusting for albuminuria and C-reactive protein attenuated the association
with high-frequency hearing impairment (1.54 [1.02­2.32] and 1.50 [1.01­2.23], respectively).
Diabetes was not associated with high-frequency hearing impairment after controlling for A1C
(1.09 [0.60­1.99]) but remained associated with low/mid-frequency impairment. We found no
evidence suggesting that our observed relationship between diabetes and hearing impairment is
due to hypertension or dyslipidemia.
CONCLUSIONS -- Mechanisms related to neuropathic or microvascular factors, inflamma-
tion, or hyperglycemia may be mediating the association of diabetes and hearing impairment.
Diabetes Care 33:811­816, 2010
Diabetes is associated with hearing
impairment in population-based
studies (1,2). Diabetes-related
hearing impairment has been described as
sensorineural in origin, implying that the
lesion may be cochlear or of the eighth
cranial nerve, but evidence favoring a spe-
cific mechanism is insufficient and con-
tradictory (3). One possibility is that
microvascular changes, which often lead
to nephropathy and retinopathy, also af-
fect the cochlear vasculature. Thickened
basilar membranes and capillaries of the
stria vascularis and atherosclerotic nar-
rowing of the internal auditory artery
were found among autopsied people who
had diabetes but not in people without
diabetes (4,5). Diabetes is also associated
with neuropathic and peripheral artery
complications that contribute to diabetic
foot ulcers (6). Atrophy of the spiral gan-
glion and demyelination of the eighth cra-
nial nerve among autopsied diabetic
patients suggest a neurological etiology to
diabetes-related hearing impairment (5).
Regardless of whether the primary lesion
is angiopathic or neuropathic, hypergly-
cemia may contribute (7).
Cardiovascular disease, hyperten-
sion, and other cardiovascular risk factors
are associated with hearing impairment
(8­10). Because people with diabetes
have a greater risk of these conditions
than those without diabetes (11,12), the
relationship between diabetes and hear-
ing impairment may be attributable to a
greater prevalence or severity of cardio-
vascular factors.
Establishing effective interventions to
disrupt the pathogenesis of diabetes-
related hearing impairment will depend
on understanding the mechanisms. This
investigation studies potential mediators
of the relationship between diabetes and
hearing impairment. Specifically, we ex-
amine whether the presence of vascular or
neuropathic conditions, cardiovascular
risk factors, glycemia, or a marker of in-
flammation explain the association be-
tween diabetes and hearing impairment.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data come from the
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) collected during
1999­2004, which used a complex, mul-
tistage, probability sample designed to be
representative of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized U.S. population (13). Of 3,192
study participants aged 40­69 years who
were randomly assigned to audiometric
testing, 2,847 (89.2%) completed the au-
diometric examination. One-half of the
sampled subjects (n  1,425) was also
randomly assigned to attend the examina-
tion during the morning session after an
overnight fast. Of those, 1,321 subjects
(92.7%) could be classified as to whether
they had diabetes either by reporting a
diagnosis (n  175) or by having valid
plasma glucose measures after fasting
8­24 h (n  1,146). Another 187 sub-
jects who reported diagnosed diabetes
and whose audiometric examination oc-
curred in the afternoon or evening were

cal sample of 1,508.
Pure-tone audiometry signals were
presented to each ear at varying intensi-
ties until the threshold at which the par-
ticipant was just able to perceive the tone
was identified. Higher thresholds indicate
greater hearing impairment. Pure-tone air
conduction hearing thresholds in deci-
bels hearing level (dB HL) were obtained
for each ear at 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000,
4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 Hz by trained
audiometric technicians using audiomet-
ric equipment and methods that have
been described (1,13).
Participants were classified as having
low/mid-frequency hearing impairment if
the average of pure-tone thresholds (here-
after referred to as pure tone average)
measured at 500, 1,000, and 2,000 Hz in
the worse ear exceeded 25 dB HL. High-
frequency hearing impairment was de-
fined as the pure-tone average measured
at 3,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 Hz in
the worse ear exceeding 25 dB HL. The
pure-tone average in the worse ear was
used to classify participants as having im-
pairment in at least one ear. We identified
14 participants with at least one audio-
metric nonresponse (tone not perceived).
Given that the average of these partici-
pants' available pure-tone thresholds ex-
ceeded 25 dB HL, we classified these
participants as impaired at the frequency
range within which the audiometric non-
response occurred.
During in-home interviews, demo-
graphic characteristics and a medical his-
tory were obtained (13). We defined
coronary heart disease as a positive re-
sponse to any of three questions asking
whether a doctor had told them they have
coronary heart disease, angina, or had had
a heart attack. Of participants who re-
ported smoking at least 100 cigarettes in
their lifetime, those who answered affir-
matively to "do you smoke now?" were
classified as current smokers. Occupa-
tional noise exposure was defined as a his-
tory of loud noise at work that required
speaking in a loud voice.
Anthropometric and clinical mea-
sures were obtained during physical ex-
aminations that included a blood draw
and urine collection (13). Participants
were identified as having diabetes from a
valid fasting plasma glucose of 126
mg/dl or a positive response to the ques-
tion, "Other than during pregnancy (for
women), have you ever been told by a
doctor that you have diabetes?" BMI was
computed from measured weight (kg) di-
vided by square of the measured height
(m)andcategorizedwithcutpointsof25,
2529.9, and 30 kg/m2. We defined
central adiposity as a waist measurement
of 102 cm for men and 88 cm for
women. We defined hypertension as sys-
tolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or dia-
stolic blood pressure 90 mmHg or
participant report of a diagnosis or cur-
rent antihypertensive medication use. Pe-
ripheral arterial disease and arterial
stiffness were derived from the ankle-
brachial index in either the right or left
ankle. We defined peripheral arterial dis-
ease as an ankle-brachial index 0.9 and
arterial stiffness as an ankle-brachial in-
dex 1.4. Peripheral neuropathy was de-
fined as having at least one insensate area
of six metatarsal sites tested (three on each
foot) using a standard 10-g monofilament
test.
Urinary albumin was determined
from a solid-phase fluorescent immuno-
assay, and urinary creatinine was ana-
lyzed using the Jaffe kinetic rate reaction.
Albuminuria was defined as a ratio of uri-
nary albumin to urinary creatinine 30
mg/g. As a marker of inflammation, C-re-
active protein (mg/dl) was quantified in
serum by latex-enhanced nephelometry
using a Behring Nephelometer (Dade Be-
hring, Somerville, NJ) and categorized
into tertiles due to skewness. Total cho-
lesterol and HDL were measured enzy-
matically. High cholesterol was defined as
total cholesterol 240 mg/dl, a positive
response to when asked if a health profes-
sional had ever told the participant he or
she has high cholesterol, or participant
report of current use of lipid-lowering
medications. Low HDL was defined as
HDL 40 mg/dl. A1C was assessed by
Boronate affinity high-performance liq-
uid chromatography using Primus
CLC330 and Primus CLC385 (Primus,
Kansas City, MO), and values were stan-
dardized to the method of the Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial, yielding
interassay coefficients of variation 3.0%
(13).
Data analysis
Statistical differences in the distribution
of covariates, including sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, noise exposure,
peripheral neuropathy, glycosylated he-
moglobin, and vascular factors, were ex-
amined using a t test (for continuous
characteristics) or 2 test (for categorical
characteristics). For the t test, values for
A1C were transformed by taking their in-
verse to meet the assumption of normal-
ity. We used logistic regression to
establish preliminary odds ratios for the
association of diabetes with hearing im-
pairment at low/mid and at high frequen-
cies, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity,
education, smoking, and occupational
noise exposure. All covariates, whether
conceptualized as potential mediators or
confounders, were regressed on diabetes
status while adjusting for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, education, and smoking (14).
Covariates were also tested for an associ-
ation with low/mid- and high-frequency
hearing impairment (without controlling
for diabetes). Significant associations of
these factors with diabetes and with hear-
ing impairment were interpreted as evi-
dence consistent with a mechanistic
pathway operating through these vari-
ables (15), with the caveat that our cross-
sectional study design does not permit
distinction between biological mediators
and confounders, which have no causal
role. We then examined whether further
statistical adjustment for a given covariate
would diminish the preliminary odds ra-
tios of diabetes with hearing impairment.
Thus, if the odds ratio for the association
of diabetes and hearing impairment de-
creased after adjusting for a potential me-
diator, we interpreted this observation as
evidence of partial mediation or partial
confounding by this factor. Finally, parsi-
monious models were developed to esti-
mate associations between diabetes and
hearing impairment simultaneously ad-
justing for all significant covariates. Age
and A1C were treated as continuous vari-
ables in all regression models. Tests of
quadratic terms for each suggested no sig-
nificant curvilinear relationship with
hearing impairment. Analyses were per-
formed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN version
10.0.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC), incorporating
6-year sample weights. For those in the
fasting sample, fasting weights were dou-
bled to account for the one-half of the
fasting sample for whom audiometric
measures were unavailable. For subjects
with diagnosed diabetes, audiometric
weights were used.
RESULTS -- Characteristics of the
U.S. population aged 40­69 years are
presented in Table 1, stratified by low/
mid- and high-frequency hearing impair-
ment. People with hearing impairment
were, on average, 6 years older than those
without hearing impairment, and a lesser
proportion was non-Hispanic black. Six-

ty-one percent of adults with high-
frequency hearing impairment were male,
which was over twice the proportion
among those without hearing impair-
ment. We found no difference in low/
mid-frequency hearing impairment by
sex. Adults with hearing impairment had
significantly less education. Over 40% of
those with high-frequency hearing im-
pairment reported occupational noise ex-
posure, compared with 24% of those
without high-frequency hearing impair-
ment. The lack of a difference in occupa-
tional noise exposure between those with
and without low/mid-frequency impair-
ment was expected because the frequen-
cies over which the pure-tone average was
calculated excluded those most suscepti-
ble to injury from noise. Age-adjusted
prevalence of diabetes among the hearing
impaired was twice that of those not im-
paired in the low/mid-frequency range
and 75% greater than those not impaired
in the high-frequency range.
Age-adjusted prevalence estimates of
potential confounders or mediators of the
association between diabetes and hearing
impairment at low/mid- and high-
frequency ranges are also presented in Ta-
ble 1. Coronary heart disease was more
prevalent among those with hearing im-
pairment in both frequency ranges, but
the difference was not significant in the
lower frequency range (P  0.09). Com-
pared with the nonimpaired subjects,
adults with high-frequency hearing im-
pairment were more likely to be over-
weight or obese, but we observed no
difference in the prevalence of central ad-
iposity by hearing impairment status.
Adults with high-frequency hearing im-
pairment had a greater prevalence of pe-
ripheral neuropathy than those who were
unimpaired; the difference was margin-
ally significant at low/mid-frequency.
Prevalence of albuminuria, peripheral ar-
terial disease, hypertension, and high
cholesterol did not differ by hearing im-
pairment status. The proportion of adults
with low HDL was higher among the
hearing impaired at both frequency

ranges. Adults with hearing impairment
had a mean A1C that was significantly
higher by 0.2%. C-reactive protein (CRP)
was shifted to higher levels among adults
with hearing impairment compared with
those without impairment, but the distri-
butions were significantly different only
at the high-frequency range. The propor-
tion of current smokers was higher among
subjects with high-frequency hearing im-
pairment than among those without.
A series of models that tested whether
anthropometric, neuropathic, vascular,
inflammatory, and glycemic factors may
be mediating the association between di-
abetes and hearing impairment is pre-
sented in Table 2. In our preliminary
model, diabetes was associated with twice
the odds of low/mid-frequency hearing
impairment (odds ratio 2.03 [95% CI
1.32­3.10]) and a 67% increased odds of
high-frequency hearing impairment
(1.67 [1.14­2.44]) while adjusting for
age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smok-
ing, and occupational noise exposure.
Hypertension, high total cholesterol,
central adiposity, peripheral arterial dis-
ease, arterial stiffness, and coronary heart
disease were not associated with either
low/mid-frequency or high-frequency
hearing impairment (data not shown).
Thus, these factors were not considered as
potential confounders or mediators of its
relationship with diabetes.
When added as an explanatory factor
of the low/mid-frequency hearing impair-
ment association with diabetes, periph-
eral neuropathy diminished the
preliminary odds ratio to 1.70 (95% CI
1.02­2.82). Controlling for peripheral
neuropathy did not attenuate the associa-
tion of diabetes with high-frequency
hearing impairment. Conversely, adjust-
ing for albuminuria did not diminish the
odds ratio for diabetes with low/mid-
frequency hearing impairment but did
lower the odds ratio for the association
with high-frequency hearing impairment
to 1.54 (1.02­2.32). The diminished as-
sociation of diabetes with low/mid-
frequency hearing impairment while
controlling for BMI (1.85 [1.20­2.84])
should be interpreted with caution be-
cause BMI was not associated with low/
mid-frequency hearing impairment in
preliminary analyses; thus, it did not meet
our established criteria for being consid-
ered a potential mediator or confounder.
BMI was associated with high-frequency
hearing impairment in preliminary anal-
yses, and controlling for its effect attenu-
ated the association of diabetes with
high-frequency impairment (1.59 [1.07­
2.37]). Low HDL did not appreciably at-
tenuate the association of diabetes with
hearing impairment in either frequency
range.
Controlling for CRP did not apprecia-
bly diminish the association of diabetes
with low/mid-frequency hearing impair-
ment but did reduce the odds ratio for
high-frequency hearing impairment to
1.50 (95% CI 1.01­2.23). Adjusting for
A1C resulted in a slightly attenuated odds
ratio of 1.90 (1.11­3.24) for the low/mid-
frequency hearing impairment associa-
tion and, for high-frequency hearing
impairment, diminished the association
so that diabetes was no longer signifi-
cantly associated (1.09 [0.60­1.99]). In
fully adjusted models, diabetes remained
significantly associated with a 98% in-
creased odds of low/mid-frequency hear-
ing impairment (1.98 [1.26­3.10]) and a
50% increased odds (1.50 [1.01­2.23])
of high-frequency hearing impairment af-
ter controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity,
education, smoking, occupational noise
exposure, and CRP (Table 3).
CONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes-related
hearing loss may be sensorineural,
whereby a cochlear or neural lesion im-
pedes the transmission of auditory signals
to the brain. We hypothesized a biological
model in which diabetes contributes to
hearing impairment through a vascular or
neuropathic mechanism, with either re-
lated to hyperglycemia. We tested this hy-
pothesis by evaluating the extent to which
controlling for A1C and markers of vas-
cular, neurologic, and inflammatory pa-
thology explained the greater prevalence
of hearing impairment among subjects
with diabetes (1).
Diabetic neuropathy is a heteroge-
neous disorder that affects sensory and
motor nerves and those responsible for
autonomic functions (16). Using mono-
filament testing on the sole of the foot, a
common screening test for diabetic pe-
ripheral neuropathy, we found some evi-
dence that peripheral neuropathy is
mediating the association with low/mid-
but not high-frequency hearing impair-
ment. Using one or more insensate sites to
classify insensate foot yields moderately
high sensitivity and specificity (80%)
(17), but the degree of false-positivity
may differ by diabetes status. The full ef-
fect of a possible mediator (or con-
founder) may not be detected if a variable

tively, our measure may be a poor proxy
for neuropathy of the cochlea.
Histopathological evidence of the in-
ner ear suggests that angiopathic mecha-
nisms plays a role in diabetes-related
hearing impairment (5). We used albu-
minuria as a proxy for cochlear vascu-
lopathy because there is increasing
recognition of pathological mechanisms
that may be shared by the renal and oto-
logical systems (18). We found a modest
effect of controlling for albuminuria,
which reduced the association of diabetes
with high-frequency hearing impairment
(odds ratio 1.67­1.54) but did not affect
the association for low/mid-frequency
impairment. Previous epidemiological
evidence of an association between ne-
phropathy (defined as renal transplant,
dialysis, gross proteinuria [100 mg/dl],
or creatinine 1.6 mg/dl) and hearing
impairment among subjects with diabetes
suggests that the relationship may only be
observable with more severe kidney dys-
function (2).
We found no evidence that any vas-
cular component to diabetes-related hear-
ing loss is mediated through or
confounded by high cholesterol, low
HDL, hypertension, or history of cardio-
vascular events. These results are consis-
tent with studies by Helzner et al. (19)
and Torre et al. (20), although Torre et al.
and Gates et al. (8) identified an associa-
tion of cardiovascular disease with co-
chlear impairment among women, a
result we did not replicate. Comparisons
should be made cautiously, however, be-
cause methodological differences of the
previous studies include sampling older
individuals, excluding mild cases of hear-
ing impairment, assessing preclinical
hearing impairment, and not adjusting for
diabetes. The low overall prevalence of
peripheral vascular disease and arterial
stiffness (3 and 1.5%, respectively) in our
relatively young sample may have limited
our ability to detect any effect of these
macrovascular conditions. Of all cardio-
vascular disease risk factors that we exam-
ined, only BMI attenuated the preliminary
associations. Our fully adjusted models
do not include BMI, so obesity may be a
marker for an inflammatory process that
promotes atherosclerosis or neuropathy
(6,21).
Our results showing CRP may mediate
the association of diabetes with high-
frequency hearing impairment suggest the
role of an inflammatory mechanism. In-
flammatory diseases resulting in sensori-
neural hearing loss have been described in
clinical studies (22,23), but to our knowl-
edge, this inflammatory marker has not
been correlated with diabetes-related hear-
ing impairment in population-based stud-
ies. CRP correlates with cardiovascular risk
factors such as obesity, HDL, hypertension,
and smoking, which might implicate an
atherosclerotic mechanism, so it is unclear
why our results do not suggest a role of
other vascular measures (24).
Glycemia may be a factor in diabetes-
related hearing impairment. In our analysis,
controllingforA1Cdiminishedtheoddsra-
tio for diabetes with low/mid-frequency
hearing impairment slightly from 2.03 to
1.90 but attenuated the association with
high-frequency hearing impairment to a
nonsignificant level. Because most of the
variance in A1C is explained by diabetes,
interpreting the role of A1C as a mediator
may be overstating the case. Glycated he-
moglobin has not been associated with
hearing impairment, both in a general pop-
ulation and among people with diabetes
(2). However, we previously demonstrated
a gradient in hearing impairment preva-
lence by glycemic status (comparing per-
sons with diabetes, impaired fasting
glucose, and normal glucose metabolism),
implicatinghyperglycemiaasapossibleme-
diator of diabetes-related hearing impair-
ment (1).
These cross-sectional data limit our
ability to distinguish between factors acting
as mediators and those operating as con-
founders, because statistical adjustment for
either will diminish the preliminary associ-
ation. When we derived models adjusting
for all independently associated potential
mediatorsorconfounders,thereremaineda
98% increased odds of low/mid-frequency
hearing impairment and a 50% increased
oddsofhigh-frequencyhearingimpairment
associated with diabetes that was left unex-
plained.Thisevidencemayindicatethatthe
measures available in these survey data do
not adequately represent the neuropathic
and microvascular mechanisms we hypoth-
esized and highlights the difficulty in study-
ing the pathology of the inner ear using
noninvasive measures. Alternatively, there
may exist unexplored biological mecha-
nisms including glucose sensitivity, insulin
resistance, temporal bone pathology, more
frequent ear infections, or genetic factors
that predispose to hearing loss and cosegre-
gate with other genetic factors that predis-
pose to diabetes.
In summary, we find that factors re-
lated to neuropathy, microangiopathy,
inflammation, and glycemia explain part
of the association between diabetes and
hearing impairment. Additional studies
are necessary to delineate temporal rela-
tionships among diabetes, potential me-
diators, and hearing impairment.
