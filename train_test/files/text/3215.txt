Research Questions
Over the last two decades, interest in how labor markets adjust to immigration has been fueled
by sharply rising numbers of international migrants, a growing inflow of refugees into Europe,
and public concern over the consequences of immigration. Against this background, this paper
studies how regional labor markets in West Germany adjusted to one of the largest forced
population movements in history, the mass inflow of eight million German expellees after World
War II. Expellees were distributed very asymmetrically across two West German regions. The
paper exploits this feature and the large time dimension of the historical data to address two
questions. First, how quickly and by what margins did regional labor markets adjust to the
expellee inflow? Second, how did the inflow affect the labor income of native workers over time?
Contribution
Despite the strong public interest in the labor market effects of immigration, two aspects of
immigration are not yet well understood: how long it takes for labor markets to adjust to
immigration and through what margins labor markets adjust. This paper analyzes both aspects.
Results and policy consequences
The paper shows that it took regional West German labor markets about a decade to absorb
the expellee inflow. While the employment of expellees increased monotonically after the inflow,
the employment of native workers decreased in the first few years after the inflow. Furthermore,
many workers migrated within West Germany to the region with few expellees. The paper also
shows that despite the large and long-lasting adjustment dynamics following the expellee inflow,
native workers experienced only a modest loss in their lifetime income of about 1.38%. Per-period
losses in native income, however, were considerably larger, especially for those native workers
who were not employed at the time of the inflow.
The analysis suggests that economic policy that affects the nature of the immigration inflow,
for example by spreading it over time, can reduce native income losses and dampen labor market
dynamics. Smaller immigration inflows, similar in magnitude to the refugee inflow that Germany
is experiencing today, also reduce native income losses markedly but decrease the duration of
labor market adjustment only modestly.

Fragestellung
In den vergangenen zwei Jahrzehnten ist das Interesse an der Frage, wie Arbeitsm¨
arkte mit
Immigration umgehen, stetig gewachsen. Das liegt unter anderem an stark steigender inter-
nationaler Migration, am wachsenden Zustrom von Fl¨
uchtlingen nach Europa, und an der weit
verbreiteten Angst vor negativen Auswirkungen auf L¨
ohne und Besch¨
aftigung. Vor diesem Hin-
tergrund analysiert das Papier, wie regionale Arbeitsm¨
arkte in Westdeutschland die Massen-
immigration von acht Millionen Vertriebenendeutschen nach dem 2. Weltkrieg aufgenommen
haben. Die Vertriebenendeutschen waren zun¨
achst sehr ungleich ¨
uber Westdeutschland verteilt.
Das Papier nutzt diese historische Besonderheit sowie die ungew¨
ohnlich lange Zeitdimension der
vorliegenden Daten aus, um zwei Forschungsfragen zu untersuchen. Erstens, wie schnell und
durch welche Mechanismen haben sich regionale Arbeitsm¨
arkte in Westdeutschland angepasst?
Zweitens, wie hat sich der Zustrom im Zeitablauf auf das Arbeitseinkommen der einheimischen
Erwerbsbev¨
olkerung ausgewirkt?
Beitrag
Trotz des gestiegenen Interesses an den Arbeitsmarkteffekten von Zuwanderung sind zwei
wichtige Aspekte von Zuwanderung bisher noch nicht hinreichend verstanden. Zum einen wissen
wir wenig dar¨
uber, wie lange es dauert, bis sich der Arbeitsmarkt vollst¨
andig an Zuwanderung
anpasst. Zum anderen wissen wir nicht, durch welche Mechanismen die Anpassung geschieht.
Das vorliegende Papier untersucht beide Aspekte.
Ergebnisse
Das Papier zeigt, dass es ca. ein Jahrzehnt gedauert hat, bis der Arbeitsmarkt nach dem
Zustrom der Vertriebenendeutschen wieder einen Normalzustand erreicht hatte. W¨
ahrend die
Besch¨
aftigung der Vertriebenendeutschen damals kontinuierlich anstieg, fiel die Besch¨
aftigung
der Einheimischen in den ersten Jahren nach dem Zustrom. Zudem gab es eine ausgepr¨
agte
Wanderungsbewegung innerhalb Westdeutschlands aus den sogenannten "Fl¨
uchtlingsl¨
andern"
in die restlichen Bundesl¨
ander. Obwohl diese Anpassungsdynamiken sehr ausgepr¨
agt und lang-
wierig waren, fiel das Lebensarbeitseinkommen der einheimischen Erwerbsbev¨
olkerung nur
relativ moderat um 1.38%. Die Verluste im Jahresarbeitseinkommen waren aber deutlich gr¨
osser,
besonders f¨
ur jene Arbeiter, die zum Zeitpunkt des Vertriebenenzuflusses arbeitslos waren.
Das Papier legt nahe, dass Wirtschaftspolitik die Einkommensverluste f¨
ur die einheimische Er-
werbsbev¨

ampfen
kann, in dem sie den Zustrom gleichm¨

How do regional labor markets adjust to immigration?
A dynamic analysis for post-war Germany

Abstract
We draw on two decades of historical data to analyze how regional labor markets in West
Germany adjusted to one of the largest forced population movements in history, the mass
inflow of eight million German expellees after World War II. The expellee inflow was dis-
tributed very asymmetrically across two West German regions. A dynamic two-region search
and matching model of unemployment, which is exposed to the asymmetric expellee inflow,
closely fits historical data on the regional unemployment differential and the regional migra-
tion rate. Both variables increase dramatically after the inflow and decline only gradually
over the next decade. We show that despite the large and long-lasting dynamics following
the expellee inflow, native workers experience only a modest loss in expected discounted
lifetime labor income of 1.38%. Per-period losses in native labor income, however, are up to
four times as large. The magnitude of income losses also depends on the initial location and
labor market status of native workers. In counterfactual analyses, we furthermore show that
economic policy interventions that affect the nature of the immigration inflow can effectively
reduce native income losses and dampen adjustment dynamics in regional labor markets.
One such intervention is to distribute the inflow more evenly over time. Smaller immigration
inflows, similar in magnitude to the refugee inflow that Germany is experiencing today, also
reduce native income losses markedly but decrease the duration of labor market adjustment
only modestly.

1 Introduction
This paper studies how regional labor markets in West Germany adjusted to one of the largest
forced population movements in history, the mass inflow of German expellees after World War II.
The eight million expellees who had arrived in West Germany by the end of 1949, most of whom
came from territories that Germany relinquished after the war, were distributed very unevenly
across the country. The share of expellees in the population ranged from 3.1% in the federal
state of Rhineland-Palatinate to 33.3% in Schleswig-Holstein. We exploit this large, unexpected,
and highly uneven inflow of expellees to take up two key research questions. First, how quickly
and by what margins did regional labor markets adjust to the expellee inflow? Second, how did
the inflow affect the native population's labor income along the adjustment path?
Our paper contributes to an extensive literature in labor economics that analyzes labor mar-
ket adjustments to immigration.1 Over the past two decades, interest in the issue has been
fueled by sharply rising numbers of international migrants and public concern about the conse-
quences of immigration. The recent surge in forced migration and the growing inflow of refugees
into Europe have only added to these concerns. Despite strong public interest, the burgeoning
literature on immigration has not yet addressed two major aspects of the adjustment process
(Borjas 2014): the length of the adjustment process and the relative importance of different
adjustment margins along the adjustment process.2 Our paper addresses these two aspects.
We start our analysis by presenting novel empirical facts on how regional labor markets
in West Germany adjusted to the inflow of expellees, drawing on more than two decades of
historical data. We derive these facts by contrasting the economic development of two stylized
regions: a high-inflow region H that consists of what were known as the "refugee states" of
Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein, and a low-inflow region L that consists of the
remaining West German states. The two regions had similar unemployment and population
growth rates before World War II. However, during and after World War II, much more expellees
fled to region H than to region L, because region H is located much closer to the homelands
1Friedberg and Hunt (1995), Okkerse (2008), Longhi, Nijkamp, and Poot (2010), Kerr and Kerr (2011), and
Borjas (2014) provide comprehensive reviews, meta-analyses, and critiques of the existing literature.
2In fact, the existing literature focuses mainly on changes in wages as the key margin through which labor
markets adjust to immigration (see, e.g., Aydemir and Borjas (2011), Manacorda, Manning, and Wadsworth (2012)
or Dustmann, Frattini, and Preston (2013)). Moreover, the literature typically analyzes the labor market effects
of immigration in a static framework (see, e.g., Card (2001), Boustan, Fishback, and Kantor (2010) or Braun and
Mahmoud (2014)). In contrast, remarkably little is known about the labor market effects of immigration along
the adjustment path and about the time that it takes the labor market to digest an immigration-induced labor
supply shock.

of expellees than region L. We compare economic developments in the two regions before the
inflow and document their subsequent relative development until 1970, two decades after the
expellee inflow was complete. We argue that this comparison is informative about the effect of
the expellee inflow because regional differences in inflow rates were very large and exogenous to
local labor market conditions.
Our empirical facts reveal that by 1950, the unemployment rate in region H was as high as
16.7% and exceeded the unemployment rate in region L by a factor of two and a half. Regional
unemployment rates then gradually converged during the 1950s and eventually fell to around 1%
by the early 1960s. The decrease and convergence in regional unemployment was accompanied
by large regional migration flows. In 1950 alone, net migration from region H to L amounted
to 1.9% of the population in region H. These large migration flows diffused the labor market
effect of the expellee inflow from region H to region L. Consequently, a direct comparison of
labor market outcomes between the two regions does not reveal the causal effect of receiving
high rather than low expellee inflows even if the initial distribution of expellees was random.3
This is all the more true at later stages of the adjustment process, as regional migration flows
accumulate over time.
To isolate the causal effect of the expellee inflow despite regional migration, we develop a
dynamic structural model with two regional labor markets that accounts for regional migration.
The backbone of this model is a dynamic two-region search and matching model of unemploy-
ment where workers also take a migration decision between the two regional labor markets.
Migration is subject to costs, except for the initial expellee inflow which we model as an ex-
ogenous increase in the number of non-employed workers. In each region, a representative firm
employs many workers and accumulates capital to produce output. The firm faces costs when it
adjusts its workforce or capital stock. We calibrate the model to historical data, and show that
the model's adjustment dynamics after the asymmetric historical expellee inflow closely fit our
empirical facts. We then use the calibrated model to address our two research questions.
With respect to the first question, we find that regional labor markets approached the new
steady state about a decade after the expellee inflow. Regional migration played a crucial role
in the adjustment process. About one-third of the initial increase in region H's population was
eventually absorbed through migration to the low-inflow region L. The adjustment process of the

case, requires ­ over the entire adjustment path ­ labor market outcomes in one region to be unaffected by the
expellee inflow to the other region.

native population differs quite dramatically from the process of the population as a whole. The
employment probability of native workers decreases in the first few quarters of the adjustment
process, whereas the employment probability of the average worker increases monotonically
throughout.
The negative effect of the expellee inflow on native employment is largest about nine quarters
after the arrival of the expellees. When measured at that time, 4.65 native workers lose their job
for every ten expellees who arrive in region H. Of those 4.65 native workers, 1.59 leave the labor
force, 2.23 enter the unemployment pool, and 0.83 leave region H for region L. About four years
after the inflow, migration to region L accounts for one-third of the decrease in region H's native
employment, and after 15 years it accounts for the entire decrease. The negative employment
effect that we find is in line, also in magnitude, with recent evidence for Germany by Glitz
(2012).
With respect to our second research question, we find that despite the large and long-lasting
adjustment dynamics in regional labor markets, the expellee inflow decreased the expected dis-
counted lifetime labor income of the average native worker in West Germany only modestly by
1.38%. However, the short-term decline in per-period labor income is much larger and reaches
up to 5.34%. Even larger is the decline in wage income, but native workers mitigate the loss in
wage income by drawing upon other sources of income. We also find that it takes more than a
decade for 90% of the loss in the expected discounted lifetime labor income of the average native
worker to be realized, and that the magnitude of the loss depends on a worker's location and
labor market status at the time of the inflow.
Income losses of native workers crucially depend on the nature of the expellee inflow. In fact,
counterfactual analyses show that changes in the timing, regional distribution, and magnitude
of the inflow can significantly reduce native income losses and dampen adjustment dynamics. In
particular, the adverse effects of expellees on native income are much less pronounced if the inflow
is spread out over time. Distributing expellees more equally across regions than was the case
historically accelerates expellees' integration into the labor market and increases their income.
Surprisingly, however, a more equal distribution also increases the income loss of the average
native worker. Reducing the overall magnitude of the expellee inflow significantly decreases
native income losses but has little effect on the duration of adjustment.
Cohen-Goldner and Paserman (2011) is one of the few studies on the dynamic effects of
3
immigration on native wages and employment.4 The authors analyze the impact of the inflow of
more than one million Soviet Jews into Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union. To capture
the dynamic adjustment to the inflow, the analysis allows the effects of immigrants to vary with
their years of tenure in the Israeli labor market. The authors show that the initially negative
wage effect of the inflow dies out after five to seven years. Their empirical approach exploits
variation in the migrant share across labor market segments and assumes that these labor market
segments are isolated from each other. In contrast, our structural approach directly accounts for
movements between regional labor market segments and therefore allows us to quantify the role
of regional migration as an adjustment margin.
A related literature, which, however, abstracts from adjustment dynamics, studies the link
between immigration and subsequent internal migration of native workers. Some studies find that
native workers indeed respond to immigration by moving out to other areas (see, for example,
Filer (1992), Borjas (2006) or Boustan, Fishback, and Kantor (2010)), while other studies find
no such effect (see, for example, Card and DiNardo (2000), Card (2001) or Kritz and Gurak
(2001)). Our paper demonstrates that the effect of immigration on native out-migration depends
crucially on the regional asymmetry and magnitude of the immigrant inflow, and on the time
elapsed since the inflow.
The economic literature has paid scarce attention to the labor market effects of forced rather
than voluntary migration (see Ruiz and Vargas-Silva (2013) for a review), despite the tens of
millions of persons who are forcefully displaced worldwide (UNHCR 2015). Braun and Mahmoud
(2014) is, to the best of our knowledge, the only other study that analyzes the labor market
effects of our specific episode of forced migration.5 The authors demonstrate that expellees had
a substantially negative effect on native employment in 1950. In contrast to our paper, Braun
and Mahmoud (2014) focus on the short-term effect of the expellee inflow and do not quantify
the relative importance of different margins through which the West German economy adjusted
over time to the expellee inflow.
4In a recent paper, Monras (2015) analyzes the short- and long-term effects of Mexican immigration into the
US on the wages of low-skilled natives. He finds that Mexican-US immigration has large negative wage effects
in the short run, and that regional migration quickly dissipates local labor supply shocks. Monras (2015) uses a
dynamic structural model to obtain the evolution of wages in a counterfactual no-migration scenario. In contrast
to our paper, however, he focuses on wage effects only ­ and hence abstracts from the unemployment and labor
force participation margins.
5In addition, Bauer, Braun, and Kvasnicka (2013) and Falck, Heblich, and Link (2012) analyze the economic
integration of expellees in post-war West Germany, and Braun and Kvasnicka (2014) analyze the effect of the
expellee inflow on sectoral change and output growth between 1939 and 1950. Burda (2006) analyzes the reallo-
cation of production factors after German reunification in 1990, and shows that the integration process involves
significant migration from East to West Germany.
4
Our paper is also related to an emerging theoretical literature that studies the effect of
immigration within search and matching models. Ortega (2000) studies a two-country model, in
which unemployed workers decide where to search for a job. Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014)
analyze the effects of immigration into the US, while Liu (2010) and Chassamboulli and Peri
(2015) analyze the effect of illegal immigration into the US. Our work differs from these papers
in three main respects. First, we focus on the adjustment dynamics triggered by immigration
rather than on the steady-state effects of immigration. Second, we study the role of regional
migration within a country as an adjustment margin to immigration. Third, we calibrate key
model parameters using data from a natural experiment.
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on our historical setting, and
Section 3 derives empirical facts on how regional labor markets in West Germany adjusted to
the expellee inflow. Section 4 develops the structural model that we use to analyze the historical
data. Section 5 explains the calibration of model parameters and assesses the model fit. Section 6
contains our main results on the channels through which regional labor markets adjusted to the
expellee inflow, the associated income effects for native workers, and various robustness checks.
Section 7 reports the results from our counterfactual exercises. Finally, Section 8 concludes.
2 Historical background and nature of the expellee inflow
Below, we shall refer to those territories east of the present-day eastern border of Germany
that were part of the German Reich before World War I as eastern territories (see Figure 1
for an overview of Germany's territorial losses between 1919 and 1945). We shall refer to the
Federal Republic of Germany as West Germany and to the German Democratic Republic as
East Germany (again, see Figure 1). Together, West and East Germany represent the territory
of present-day Germany, to which we refer as post-war Germany.
Three phases of displacement. The displacement of Germans from central and eastern
Europe took place between 1944 and 1950, and occurred in three different phases. The first
phase took place during the final stages of the war, the second phase occurred between the end
of the war in May 1945 and the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945, and the third phase after
the conclusion of the Potsdam Agreement.
The first phase of the displacement took place as the Red Army advanced westwards in the
final stages of World War II. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Germans from the eastern

territories of the German Reich fled further inland. Most of these refugees planned to return
home after the end of the war, and therefore fled to regions close to their former homelands.
After Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender in May 1945, some refugees did indeed manage
to return home.
The second phase of the displacement took place in the months immediately following the end
of the war. Polish authorities first prevented refugees from returning to their former homelands
and then started to expel the remaining German population. These "wild" expulsions had not
yet been sanctioned by an international treaty. The Czechoslovakian authorities soon followed
the Polish example and also began to drive the German population out of the country.
The third phase of the displacement began after the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and
the United States concluded the Potsdam Agreement of August 1945. The Agreement legalized
and sanctioned the expulsion of Germans from central and eastern Europe and shifted the
German-Polish border westwards. The eastern territories that Germany lost after World War II
were placed under Polish or Russian control (see Figure 1). Germans remaining east of the new
6
border were brought to post-war Germany in compulsory and organized transfers.
The Potsdam Agreement also divided post-war Germany into British, French, American, and
Soviet zones of occupation. The three western zones were merged into West Germany in 1949.
The Soviet zone became East Germany in 1950. Below, we characterize the expellee inflow to
West Germany, which is the focus of our analysis.
Regional distribution of expellees. The expellee inflow prompted a dramatic increase in
the population of West Germany. Despite heavy war losses, the West German population grew
from 39 million in 1939 to 48 million in 1949. By the end of 1949, 7.7 million expellees had
arrived in West Germany, accounting for 16.3% of the West German population.
More than half of the expellees came from the eastern territories that Germany had ceded
after World War II, such as East Prussia and Silesia. Another quarter had lived in Czechoslovakia
before the war, most of them in the Sudentenland.6 The remaining expellees came mostly from
the eastern territories that Germany had already ceded after its defeat in World War I, such as
Posen and West Prussia.
The share of expellees in the population differed greatly across West German states, and
ranged at the end of 1949 from 3.1% in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to 33.3% in Schleswig-
Holstein. There are three main reasons for the very uneven regional distribution of expellees in
West Germany.
First, German refugees who fled the approaching Red Army during the final stages of the war
(first phase of displacement) mainly sought shelter in regions close to their former homelands.
The "wild" expulsions (second phase of displacement) only added to the uneven regional distri-
bution, as Polish and Czechoslovakian authorities often just drove Germans across the border
into what was post-war Germany.
Second, the French refusal to admit any of the organized expellee transfers (third phase of
displacement) to their zone of occupation led to a very uneven distribution of expellees between
West German occupation zones. As they had not been invited to the Potsdam Conference, the
French did not feel bound by the Potsdam Agreement. Therefore, expellees to West Germany
were initially transferred only to the American and British zones of occupation.
Third, expellees were more likely to be placed in areas where housing was available. Since the
6The Sudetenland, though mainly inhabited by German speakers, had become part of the independent
Czechoslovak state after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918. It was annexed by Nazi Germany
in September 1938.
7
Allied bombing campaigns had destroyed much of the housing stock in major West German cities,
the expellees often had to be transferred to more rural regions that had been less devastated by
the war (Connor 2007, Burchardi and Hassan 2013).7
Unlike in most other immigration episodes, the initial regional distribution of expellees in
West Germany was not driven by local labor market conditions (Braun and Kvasnicka 2014,
Braun and Mahmoud 2014). This was because in all three phases of the displacement, expellees
were generally unable to choose their initial destination in West Germany based on local eco-
nomic conditions. As mentioned before, expellees fled to the most accessible regions west of
the front line in the first phase of the displacement, and were brought to West Germany in
compulsory expellee transfers in the second and third phase. Local authorities then distributed
expellees based on the availability of housing, not jobs (Nellner 1959). Regions that received
many expellees thus differed little in their pre-inflow economic conditions from regions that
received only few expellees. We will back up this point in Section 3.
The regional distribution of expellees remained largely unchanged until the end of 1949
because the occupying powers banned relocations in the immediate post-war period.8 The occu-
pying powers wanted all German residents, irrespective of whether they were expellees or not,
to remain wherever they had arrived in Germany or had been located on the day of armistice.
After the total ban was abolished in 1947, moving required permission from the military admin-
istration (permission was granted mostly for family reunification). The restrictions on regional
mobility were lifted only as late as May 1949 (M¨
uller and Simon 1959, Ziemer 1973). In addition
to legal restrictions, the heavy destructions brought by the war and the resulting lack of housing
space impeded regional mobility at that time.
Socio-demographic characteristics of expellees. Expellees were relatively close substi-
tutes to native West Germans on the German labor market. They were all German native
speakers and had been educated in German schools. In addition, expellees and native inhabi-
tants had, in most cases, been living in the same country for decades (the eastern territories,
home to most expellees, had been part of the German Reich since it was founded in 1871).
Moreover, expellees were not a selected sub-group of their home regions, as virtually all Ger-
mans living east of the new German-Polish border were forced to migrate. This contrasts with
7Vony´
o (2012) shows that geographic, rather than economic characteristics explain regional differences in the
scale of housing damage. In particular, he finds that distance from the Royal Air Force headquarters in High
Wycombe was the crucial determinant in the scale of damage.
8The state-level expellee shares in 1946 and 1949 are highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.996.

Notes: a Expellees are defined as German nationals or ethnic Germans who on
1 September 1939 lived (i) in the former German territories east of the Oder-

German. b The education statistics distinguish between expellees and native West
Germans (excluding non-German foreigners). All other statistics distinguish be-
tween expellees and the rest of the population. c The education statistics are for
those who were born between 1885 and 1927 (aged 23 to 65 in 1950). The over-
whelming majority of these persons should have completed their education by 1950.

most other migration episodes, in which immigrants are a selected group of the population from
the countries of orgin (Borjas 1987, Chiquiar and Hanson 2005).
Table 1 shows that expellees and native West Germans were indeed very similar in their
socio-demographic characteristics. As is evident, there were more women than men among both
expellees and non-expellees, a legacy of the two world wars. Expellees were slightly younger than
native inhabitants and, therefore, also less likely to be married. Moreover, expellees had almost
identical years of schooling to natives, a similar probability of having completed vocational
training, and a slightly higher probability of having graduated from university. Overall, therefore,
differences between natives and expellees were small ­ especially when compared with other
migration episodes (see OECD (2008) for a detailed comparison of the characteristics of the
immigrant and native population in OECD countries).

3 Empirical facts on regional development
We now present novel empirical facts on how regional labor markets in West Germany adjusted
to the large and asymmetric inflow of expellees. We derive these facts by comparing the de-
mographic and economic developments of two stylized regions, a high-inflow region H and a
low-inflow region L, between 1939 and 1970. Our key labor market variables are regional un-
employment rates and the West German labor force participation rate. We further describe the
evolution of regional population and the underlying migration flows between the two regions.
Finally, we use regional GDP per capita as a measure of regional income differences.9
3.1 Regional classification and pre-war differences
Table 2 shows how we classified the West German federal states (Bundesl¨
ander) into a high-
and a low-inflow region. It also provides an overview of expellee inflows into these regions, of
selected economic characteristics before the war and of the regional degree of war damage.
The high-inflow region H consists of Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein. These
three states were called "refugee states" (Fl¨
uchtlingsl¨
ander) in contemporary publications. Al-
though the refugee states accounted for only a third of West Germany's pre-war population,
they were hosting more than 60% of all expellees by the end of 1949. The population share of
expellees in region H was 25.1% (see column (3) of Table 2). The low-inflow region L consists of
the remaining West German states, namely Baden-W¨
urttemberg, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate,
North Rhine-Westphalia, and the city states of Bremen and Hamburg.10 The population share
of expellees in region L was 10.5% at the end of 1949, and thus less than half of the population
share in region H.
The states in region H hosted considerably more expellees than those in region L for all
three reasons discussed in Section 2. First, all three states in region H were relatively easily
accessible for refugees who were fleeing the approaching Red Army during the final stages of
the war. Bavaria was the prime destination for refugees from neighboring Sudetenland, and
Schleswig-Holstein was the prime destination for refugees from East-Prussia arriving via the
Baltic Sea. Lower Saxony received an over-proportional number of refugees because of its general
9Since our theoretical analysis focuses on labor income of workers, we would have preferred to use a measure of
wage income. However, to the best of our knowledge, data on total wage income in the two regions is not available
for the period of our analysis.
10Saarland was not yet part of West Germany in 1949. West Berlin was, in legal terms, occupied territory and
defacto a West German enclave until reunification in 1990. Baden-W¨
urttemberg was formed in 1952 from the
territories of the formerly independent states of Baden, W¨
urttemberg-Baden, and W¨
urttemberg-Hohenzollern.
10
proximity to the eastern territories. Second, all three states were not located in the French zone
of occupation that was initially sealed for expellees. Third, all three states retained a relatively
intact housing stock during the war.
Before we compare the economic developments in the regions after the expellee inflow, we
briefly study whether the regions already differed before the inflow. Pre-existing differences might
provide an alternative explanation, other than the asymmetric expellee inflow, for observed
differences in regional economic development after the inflow.
Columns (4) to (7) of Table 2 report pre-war data on regional population growth, unem-
ployment, agricultural employment, and national income per capita, and column (8) shows the
percentage of housing destroyed in the war. Before the war, population growth rates were very
similar in the two regions. The population in region H grew by 10.7% between 1925 and 1939,
only 0.7 percentage points more than the population in region L. Likewise, unemployment rates
were very similar before the war, reaching 1.6% in region H and 2.0% in region L in 1938 (see
column (4)).11
However, Table 2 also shows that region H was less industrialized and more rural in nature
than region L. This reflects the fact that, as discussed in Section 2, expellees were more likely
to be transferred to rural areas than to urban areas. The table illustrates that in 1939, 36.5%
of the labor force in region H, but just 21.8% in region L, worked in the agricultural sector
(see column (6)). Since the agricultural sector was less productive than the non-agricultural
sector (Eichengreen and Ritschl 2009), region H was also somewhat poorer than region L (see
column (7)). In fact, national income per capita was around 8% lower in H than in L in 1936.12
Moreover, the more rural region H also suffered less from war damage than region L, since
the Allied bombing campaign primarily targeted German cities. Around 12% of all dwellings
in region H were destroyed during the war, considerably less than the West German average of
20.3% (see column (8)).
11In the wake of the massive rearmament policy undertaken by Nazi Germany, full employment existed in 1938.
Unemployment figures for 1938 might, therefore, be uninformative about structural differences in unemployment
rates between the two regions. Prior to 1938, unemployment tended to be somewhat lower in region H than in
region L. In fact, the unemployment rate in 1936 was 6.3% in region H and 9.2% in region L. Importantly, there is
no evidence that unemployment was higher in region H before the war, as we observe it for the post-war period.
12 Since pre-war data on unemployment and income are not available for the West German states in their
post-war borders, we had to approximate their values for regions H and L. We approximate 1936 national income
in region H as the population-weighted average of income in Bavaria, Hanover, and Schleswig-Holstein. We then
use the average national income in the rest of West Germany (excluding Hamburg and Bremen, Oldenburg,
Braunschweig, Lippe, Schaumburg-Lippe) as a proxy for national income in region L. We discard the data for
Bremen, Oldenburg, Braunschweig, Lippe, and Schaumburg-Lippe, as data for these regions are only reported as
an aggregate figure. The aggregation from the former regions of the German Reich to our stylized regions is far
from perfect. Therefore, the figures should be interpreted with some caution.

Data sources: Data on expellees in 1949 come from Statistisches Bundesamt (1955c). Data on the population and the agricultural employment share in 1939 are
from Statistisches Bundesamt (1954). Data on the expellee share in 1946 come from Statistisches Bundesamt (1952), and data on the population in 1925 from
Hohls and Kaelble (1989). Data on national income and on 1938 unemployment rates come from L¨
anderrat des Amerikanischen Besatzungsgebiets (1949), and
data on the share of destroyed dwellings in 1946 from Deutscher St¨
adtetag (1949).
Notes: 1 Expellees are defined as German nationals or ethnic Germans who on 1 September 1939 lived (i) in the former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse
line, (ii) in Saarland or (iii) abroad. 2 The unemployment rate is expressed as a percentage of the dependent labor force. Pre-war unemployment data is not
available for the West German states in their post-war borders. The unemployment rate of region H is approximated by the labor-force-weighted average of
the unemployment rates in the employment agency districts of Bavaria, Lower Saxony, Nordmark. The unemployment rate of region L is approximated by
the average of the unemployment rates in Hesse, Southwest Germany, Rhineland and Westphalia. 3 Pre-war national income data are not available for the
West German states in their post-war borders. National income of region H is approximated as the population-weighted average of national income in Bavaria,
Hannover, and Schleswig-Holstein. National income of region L is approximated as the average income of Baden, W¨
urttemberg, Hesse, and Hesse-Nassau, the
Rhine Province and Westphalia. 4 The share of destroyed dwellings is calculated as the share of dwellings that were completely destroyed as a percentage of the
housing stock in mid-1943.

Our benchmark model ignores pre-existing differences between the two regions. In additional
robustness checks, however, we incorporate these differences into our analysis in two ways (see
Section 6.3). First, we account for them directly in our model. In particular, we allow for regional
differences in the degree of war damage. Second, we use an alternative classification of federal
states that levels out pre-existing differences in the degree of industrialization and war damage.
We then show that both the empirical facts and our quantitative results in the structural model
are robust to the use of this alternative classification.
3.2 Empirical facts
We compare the demographic and economic developments of regions H and L in 1939, i.e.,
before the flight and expulsion, and between 1950 and 1970, i.e., in the first two decades after
the expellee inflow was complete.
Unemployment and labor force participation. Figure 2 shows the unemployment rates in
regions H and L before the war in 1938, and between 1950 and 1963 (our data series ends in 1963,
as time-consistent regional employment data is not available after then). Before the war, both
regions had almost full employment (unemployment rates were 1.6% and 2% in region H and
L, respectively). Unemployment then increased dramatically in both regions in the immediate
post-war period. However, the situation was much more severe in the high-inflow region H, where
the unemployment rate was 16.7% in 1950, than in the low-inflow region L, where it was 6.4%.
The 1950 unemployment rate in region H thus exceeded the unemployment rate in region L
by a factor of two and a half. Expellees were much more likely to be unemployed than native
workers at that time: every third unemployed person in West Germany was an expellee in 1950
(compared with a share of expellees in the population of 16.5%).13
Regional unemployment rates in both regions then gradually decreased in the 1950s. By
the early 1960s, both regions were back at what was basically full employment. Nevertheless,
unemployment remained slightly higher in region H than in region L until 1963.
We augment the unemployment data with data on labor force participation because the
unemployment data only cover persons who were officially registered as unemployed. In contrast,
persons who would generally like to work but have nevertheless withdrawn from the labor market,
13Expellees then benefited dis-proportionally from the fall in unemployment in the 1950s. By 1958, their share
among the unemployed had fallen to 22.0%. Unfortunately, we cannot calculate separate unemployment rates for
expellees and non-expellees, as our data on employment does not distinguish between the two groups.
13
say because they consider their chances of finding a job to be small, are not officially registered
as unemployed. An increase in the number of discouraged workers does not, therefore, show up
as an increase in unemployment, but rather as a fall in labor force participation.
Figure 2 shows that the decline in regional unemployment in the 1950s coincided with an
increase in the West German labor force participation rate from 66.9% in 1950 to 70.6% in 1957
(unfortunately, participation rates are not available at a regional level for 1950-63).14 Labor force
participation was, therefore, low in 1950, most likely because labor market prospects were dire.
This suggests that hidden unemployment was high at that time. As the labor market recovered,
and the probability of finding a job grew, formerly discouraged workers might have increasingly
chosen to re-join the labor force.

Data sources: The unemployment data come from L¨
anderrat des Amerikanischen Besatzungsgebiets (1949)
(for 1938) and from various issues of the Amtliche Nachrichten of the Bundesanstalt f¨
ur Arbeitsvermittlung
und Arbeitslosenversicherung (for 1950-63). Data on economically active persons, used to calculate the labor
force participation rate, are taken from Sensch (2004), Table B3.1. Data on the total population aged 16-65
come from the Statistisches Bundesamt.
Notes: The unemployment rate is expressed as a percentage of the dependent labor force. The unemployment
rate of region H in 1938 is approximated by the (labor force-weighted) average of the 1938 unemployment rates
of Bavaria, Lower Saxony, Nordmark, the unemployment rate of region L by the average of the unemployment
rates of Hesse, Southwest Germany, Rhineland and Westphalia. The labor force participation rate is the ratio
of all economically active persons to the population aged 15-65.
14We report the labor force participation rate for the same period, for which unemployment data are available.
The labor force participation rate is the ratio of all economically active persons to the population aged 15-65.
We do not compare the post-war labor force participation rate to its pre-war level because the war dramatically
changed the demographic composition of the West German population. For instance, men in their twenties were
more likely to die in the war than women or older men. Since labor force participation rates vary strongly by age
and gender, the war is likely to have had a major effect on labor force participation.
14
Population and internal migration. The red line in Figure 3 shows that the population
size of region H relative to region L soared from 50.6% in 1939 to 65.0% at the end of 1949. The
expellee inflow, therefore, changed the relative size of the two regions dramatically.15 Relative
population then gradually came down again and reached 53.7% in 1970.
The blue line in Figure 3 shows that regional migration from H to L was by far the most im-
portant factor in moving the relative population size of the two regions back towards its pre-war
level. The line shows how the relative population size of the two regions would have evolved if the
only reason for changes in the relative population size had been migration between region H and
region L. The migration-based population series thus abstracts from other potential influences,
such as differences in fertility rates or migration from abroad, on the relative population size of
the two regions. It declines from 65.0% in 1949 to 54.5% in 1960.
Figure 4 plots the migration-based population series separately for native inhabitants and
expellees, and shows that regional migration markedly reduced the relative population of both
groups in the 1950s. Through migration alone, the relative native population fell from 54.4% in
1949 to 49.6% in 1960 and that of expellees fell from 155.7% to 85.9%. The strong decline in the
relative expellee population also suggests that expellees were more likely to leave region H for
region L than natives. In fact, the migration rate of expellees stood at a stunning 4.4% in 1950
­ and was thus four times higher than the migration rate of natives (1.1%). It fell in tandem
with the overall regional migration rate but still exceeded it in 1958.
GDP per capita. Figure 5 shows GDP per capita of region H relative to region L between
1950 and 1970. The data shows that in 1950, GDP per capita of region H reached just 75.4% of
region L's level. The regional gap then narrowed considerably during the 1950s and early 1960s,
and relative GDP per capita stood at 84.2% in 1963. The mid- and late-1960s saw no further
improvement in region H's relative GDP per capita. If anything, the gap in comparison with
15The inflow of expellees was by far the most important driver of this dramatic increase in relative population
(see Braun and Mahmoud (2014) for a comprehensive overview of regional population changes in West Germany
between 1939 and 1950). However, it was not the only one. Even without the inflow of expellees, region H's
population would have grown by more than 713,000 (or 5.4%) between 1939 and 1949. Region L's population, in
contrast, would have decreased by 2.0%. There are two main reasons for this difference. First, the states of Lower
Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, both part of region H, bordered the Soviet zone of occupation, and, therefore, also
received a disproportionately large share of migrants from what was to become the German Democratic Republic.
Second, the number of civilian casualties was lower in rural areas than in urban areas, and therefore many city
dwellers, especially from Bremen and Hamburg, were evacuated to more rural areas during the war.
Since we consider only the expellee inflow and endogenous regional migration as a sources of population change,
we calibrate the model to an adjusted relative population of the two regions in 1939. The adjustment adds to the
1939 population of each region the residual population change between 1939 and 1950 that cannot be accounted
for by the expellee inflow. We calculate the residual as the difference between the historical population change
between 1939 and 1950 and the inflow of expellees. The adjusted relative population of region H is 54.4%.

region L widened again.
How did relative GDP per capita change between 1939 and 1950? Unfortunately, there are
no pre-war GDP data for West German regions that are comparable to the post-war data. To
nevertheless gauge the pre- to post-war changes in relative GDP per capita, we use two proxies
for regional differences in GDP per capita before the war (see Appendix A.1 for more details on
16
the two proxies).
The first proxy uses national income data from 1936, as also reported in Table 2. National
income per capita of region H reached 92% of region L's value in 1936. Judged by this measure,
region H suffered a significant fall in relative GDP per capita following the expellee inflow (Figure
5 shows the 1936 value of relative national income along with data for relative GDP per capita
for 1950-70). The second proxy for regional differences in GDP per capita uses firm sales as a
proxy for production, as suggested by Vony´
o (2012). Relative sales per capita in region H fell
from 69.5% of region L's value in 1935 to 59.1% in 1950, and then increased to 63.6% in 1955.16
Overall, therefore, both proxies suggest that relative GDP per capita decreased significantly
in region H between 1939 and 1950. Relative GDP per capita then bounced back in the 1950s
(and early 1960s). Since we do not have comparable data on GDP per capita from before the
war, we cannot conclude whether or not relative GDP per capita returned to its pre-inflow level.

Data sources: Data for 1936 are from L¨

Notes: The data point for 1936 is the (approximated) national income of region H relative to region L. We
calculate the 1936 national income in region H as the population-weighted average of income in Bavaria,
Hanover, and Schleswig-Holstein. We then use the average national income in the rest of West Germany (ex-
cluding Hamburg and Bremen, Oldenburg, Braunschweig, Lippe, Schaumburg-Lippe) as a proxy for national
income in region L. See the text for further explanation. All other data points give GDP per capita of region
H relative to region L.
Summary of empirical facts. To sum up, we have established five empirical facts.
16As evident, the relative level of sales per capita is lower than the relative level of GDP per capita. This is
mainly due to the fact that the share in sales per capita of the two city states, which are both part of region L,
is much larger than their share in GDP per capita. Comparable data is no longer available after 1955.
17
1. Unemployment rates increased dramatically between 1938 and 1950 in both regions. The
1950 unemployment rate was two and half times larger in region H than in region L. Un-
employment then gradually declined during the 1950s, and both regions were recording full
employment again by the early 1960s. Expellees were much more likely to be unemployed
than natives.
2. The labor force participation rate in West Germany increased strongly between 1950 and
1957, and remained constant thereafter.
3. The relative population size of region H went up from 50.6% in 1939 to 65.0% at the end
of 1949, and then gradually decreased in the 1950s.
4. Migration from region H to L was the decisive factor in moving relative population back
towards its pre-war level in the 1950s. Expellees were much more likely to leave region H
for region L than native inhabitants.
5. Relative GDP per capita of region H declined between 1939 and 1950. After 1950, region
H experienced considerably faster economic growth than region L up to the early 1960s.
To quantify to what extent these empirical facts can indeed be understood as a consequence
of the expellee inflow, we now derive a dynamic two-region search and matching model of unem-
ployment. The benchmark model acts upon the assumptions that the two regions were identical
before the inflow, and that no asymmetric shock other than the expellee inflow hit the two
regions over the time period considered. We relax both assumptions in our robustness checks in
Section 6.3.
The dynamic search and matching model allows us to quantify and interpret the regional
adjustment processes after the inflow shock, because it offers three important advantages over
a reduced-form regression model. First, the search and matching model accounts for regional
migration that diffuses the effect of regional expellee inflows. Such diffusion effects are difficult
to account for in purely empirical work, especially when the data have a long time dimension.
Second, the dynamic search and matching model allows us to assess the effect of the expellee
inflow on variables that we do not directly observe in the data, such as regional wages, regional
employment of native workers and expellees, or the cost of regional migration. Therefore, we can
quantify the effects of immigration on natives using comprehensive income measures. Finally,
the dynamic search and matching model allows us to run counterfactual exercises, in which we

can disentangle the importance of different variables, such as the regional distribution of the
expellee inflow or the magnitude of migration costs, in shaping adjustment dynamics and the
effect on native income.
4 A dynamic model of regional labor markets
The backbone of our model is the textbook Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search and matching
model of unemployment. We depart from a version of this model with endogenous labor force
participation and extend it in two directions that are motivated by the particular historical
episode that we study.
Our first extension is regional migration. We consider two regional labor markets ­ one in
region H and another in region L ­ that interact via migration. Workers who search for a job
choose whether to search in region H or L.17 Migration decisions are forward looking and subject
to migration costs. Our second extension incorporates regional expellee inflows into the model.
We model them as an exogenous increase in the number of non-employed workers, i.e., as a labor
supply shock, and calibrate the regional distribution of this shock from the historical data.
In each region, a representative firm employs many workers and accumulates capital to pro-
duce output. Output is homogenous across regions and serves as numeraire. Adjusting employ-
ment or the capital stock is subject to adjustment costs. Furthermore, we consider a competitive
equilibrium, in which firms and workers bargain over the wage. Our description of the model
focuses on region H with the understanding that region L is formulated symmetrically to region
H. Variables that pertain to region L are superscripted by a star and/or subscripted by L.
19
4.1 Labor market stocks and flows
The working-age population Pt in region H at time t comprises employed workers Nt, unemployed
workers Ut, and non-participating workers Rt, and hence Pt = Nt +Ut +Rt. Regional population
evolves over time, because Xt expellees enter the labor market in region H exogenously and
non-employed workers move endogenously between regions. This yields
Pt = Pt-1 + Xt + Gt
- Gt , (1)
where Gt
- Gt denotes net migration to region H.
Figure 6 summarizes the timing of events within a period. We assume that all expellees are
non-employed upon arrival, because they were forced to emigrate to a new environment and,
hence, gave up previous employment. Despite initial non-employment, however, some expellees
in the model are employed by the end of the first period, because a worker can move through
several labor market states within a period.
We also assume that expellees are homogenous to native workers in our model. The homo-
geneity assumption reflects the fact that expellees and natives were close substitutes on the West
German labor market (see Section 2). Burda (2006) adopts a similar homogeneity assumption
in his analysis of regional economic integration between East and West Germany after German
reunification.
Figure 6 shows that non-employed workers, both expellees and natives, decide at the begin-
ning of period t whether or not to participate in the labor market. The workers' participation
probability, denoted by t, then determines the size of the reserve pool Rt of workers who are
out of the labor force:
Rt = (1 - t)[Pt-1 + Xt
- (1 - )Nt-1] . (2)
Square brackets in this equation contain the number of non-employed workers at time t, which
equals population in the previous period Pt-1 plus expellee inflow Xt minus workers with ongoing
jobs (1 - )Nt-1. Here, 0 <  < 1 denotes the fraction of previously employed workers who are
exogenously separated from their jobs.
Participating workers who are non-employed decide whether they migrate to region L's labor

not workers who are employed, decide whether to migrate.

market. The participation decision predates the migration decision (see Figure 6), because we
treat migration as being motivated by labor market prospects. The workers' migration proba-
bility, denoted by t, then determines H to L migration:
Gt = t[Pt-1 + Xt
- (1 - )Nt-1 - Rt] . (3)
Production in region H takes place once the participating workers who stay in region H have
moved into either unemployment or employment. Employment, which evolves according to
Nt = (1 - )Nt-1 + Mt, (4)
corresponds to new jobs, denoted by Mt, plus workers with ongoing jobs. The sum of employed
and unemployed workers equals the labor force, i.e., Lt = Nt +Ut. Unemployed workers, workers
separated from their job, and non-participating workers enter the next period as non-employed,
and a new labor market cycle begins.
Equations (1) to (4) determine population, employment, H to L migration, and the labor
force in region H given initial conditions P-1 and N-1, L to H migration Gt
, expellee inflow Xt,
and transition probabilities t and t.
4.2 Labor market states and their values
In each period, a worker occupies one out of six labor market states. These states are employment,
unemployment, and non-participation in either region H or L. Each state is accompanied by a
value function that determines a worker's value of being in this state. The value of an employed
worker in region H at date t is denoted by Wt and recursively computed as
Wt = wt + (1 - )Wt+1 + Eh max(Ht+1(h), (5)
E max(t+1Wt+1 + (1 - t+1)Qt+1, t+1
Wt+1
+ (1 - t+1
)Qt+1
- ) ) .
The employed worker receives wage wt (in units of the numeraire) at date t and the expected
continuation value, discounted at 0 <  < 1, at date t + 1. The expected continuation value in
equation (5) has two parts. The first part occurs with likelihood 1 -  and is the value Wt+1 of
a worker who remains employed in the next period. The second part occurs with likelihood 
and is the value of a worker who loses his job at the end of period t. This second part depends
on the two sequential decisions, each indicated by a max operator, that the worker takes at the
21
beginning of period t + 1.
The worker decides to participate in the labor market if the value of non-participation,
denoted by Ht+1(h), is smaller than the value of participation (captured by E[. . . ] in equation
(5)). The value of non-participation depends on the idiosyncratic home benefit parameter h  0
that each non-employed worker draws at the beginning of a period from a random distribution
with cdf . Operator Eh denotes the worker's date t expectation about this source of date t + 1
uncertainty.
Furthermore, the worker decides to migrate to region L if the value of searching for a job in
region H is smaller than the value of searching for a job in region L net of migration costs. The
value of searching for a job in region H, t+1Wt+1 + (1 - t+1)Qt+1, depends on the job-finding
rate t+1, the value of an employed worker Wt+1, and the value of an unemployed worker Qt+1.
Migration costs are denoted by   0 and are idiosyncratic. At the beginning of a period, each
non-employed worker draws  from a distribution with cdf . Draws  and h are independent
of each other.
The value of an unemployed worker in region H is recursively computed according to
Qt = z + Eh max(Ht+1(h), (6)
E max(t+1Wt+1 + (1 - t+1)Qt+1, t+1
Wt+1
+ (1 - t+1
)Qt+1
- ) ) .
The unemployed worker receives unemployment benefits z > 0 and the expected discounted
continuation value. The continuation value of the unemployed worker refers to the same sequence
of participation and migration decision through which an employed worker moves when he loses
his job at the end of period t.
Finally, the value of a worker who does not participate in the labor market and has home
benefit parameter h corresponds to
Ht(h) = h - z + Qt . (7)
This parsimonious formulation of Ht(h) emerges, because we model participation as a decision
about the current period only. Thus, the continuation value of the unemployed worker in equation
(6), which corresponds to Qt
- z, and the continuation value of the non-participating worker
coincide.
22
4.3 Migration and participation probabilities
There is a critical level of idiosyncratic migration costs, denoted by c
t
, at which the worker is
indifferent between regions, because this critical level equates the value of searching for a job in
region H to the value of searching for a job in region L net of migration costs:
c
t
= [t
Wt
+ (1 - t
)Qt
] - {tWt + (1 - t)Qt
} . (8)
Idiosyncratic migration costs  below c
t
induce the worker to migrate, whereas idiosyncratic
costs above c
t
prevent migration. Accordingly, c
t
determines the probability of a worker mi-
grating from region H to L in period t, conditional on this worker being non-employed at the
beginning of this period:
t = (c
t
) . (9)
We assume that  is uniform over [0, a] with parameter a > 0. We interpret 1/a, which determines
the sensitivity of t with respect to c
t
, as workers' propensity to migrate, because increasing
1/a makes t more sensitive to c
t
 [0, a]. A small propensity to migrate also coincides with
large (unconditional) expected migration costs, which are equal to a/2.
There is also a critical level of home benefits, denoted by hc
t
, at which the worker is indifferent
between participation and non-participation, because this critical level equates the value of non-
participation to the value of participation:
H(hc
t
) = E max(tWt + (1 - t)Qt, t
Wt
+ (1 - t
)Qt
- ) .
Rearranging this equation using the probability of migrating, t, and expected idiosyncratic
migration costs conditional on migration, denoted by ¯
t = E[| < c
t
], yields
H(hc
t
) = (1 - t) tWt + (1 - t)Qt + t t
Wt
+ (1 - t
)Qt
- ¯
t .
Replacing H(hc
t
) by hc
t
- z + Qt (see equation (7)) and further rearranging yields
hc
t
= z + t(Wt
- Qt) + t(c
t
- ¯
t) . (10)
Thus, hc
t
is bounded from below by the level of unemployment benefit z and increases when
labor market prospects improve. Improved prospects in region H increase the expected net value
23
of work t(Wt
- Qt). Furthermore, improved prospects in region L make migration from region
H to L more attractive and, hence, increase the expected net value of migration t(c
t
- ¯
t). The
critical level of home benefits determines the probability of participating,
t = (hc
t
) , (11)
because draws of h  0 above hc
t
induce the worker not to participate in the labor market.
We assume that  is uniform over [e0, e1] with e0 < e1. We interpret e0, which determines
the sensitivity of the participation probability with respect to hc
t
, as workers' propensity to
participate in the labor market, because increasing e0 makes t more sensitive to hc
t
 [e0, e1].
Using equations (8) to (11), we rewrite value functions (5) and (6) in terms of transition
probabilities, the expected net value of migration t(c
t
- ¯
t), and the expected net value of
staying at home (1 - t)(¯
ht
- hc
t
):
Wt = wt + Wt+1 - (1 - t+1)(Wt+1 - Qt+1) + (1 - t+1)(¯
ht+1 - hc
t+1
)
+t+1(c
t+1
- ¯
t+1) , (12)
Qt = z + Qt+1 + t+1(Wt+1 - Qt+1) + (1 - t+1)(¯
ht+1 - hc
t+1
)
+t+1(c
t+1
- ¯
t+1) , (13)
where ¯
ht is the expected home benefit conditional on non-participation, i.e., ¯
ht = Eh[h|h  hc
t
].
Transition probabilities t, t, and t, which workers take as given, are endogenously determined
in equilibrium.
4.4 Firm behavior, wage bargaining, and labor market matching
Workers in region H are employed by firms in this region. Firms use their workforce and capital
stock to produce output. Output is homogenous across regions and serves as numeraire. Firms
are indexed by j  [0, 1], and the behavior of a representative firm j follows from a standard
profit maximization problem. In this problem, the firm selects (sequences of) employment Njt,
24
vacancies Vjt, capital stock Kjt, and investment Ijt to maximize its discounted period profits:
max
{Vjt,Njt,Kjt,Ijt}

t=0
t [F(Kjt-1, Njt) - wtNjt
- Ijt
- C(Vjt, Njt, qt)] s.t. (14)
Jjt : Njt = (1 - )Njt-1 + qtVjt , (15)
jt : Kjt = (1 - )Kjt-1 + (1 - B(Ijt/Ijt-1))Ijt , (16)
and subject to the initial conditions Kj,-1, Ij,-1, Nj,-1.
Period profits accrue from output, which the firm produces with technology F(·), after de-
ducting the wage bill wtNjt, investment Ijt, and employment adjustment costs C(·). Employment
in equation (15) comprises (non-separated) incumbent workers and new workers, which arrive
at the job-filling rate qt (defined below). Capital in equation (16) depreciates at rate  and is
subject to investment adjustment costs B(·), which penalize changes in investment and, hence,
slows down capital accumulation. Furthermore, Lagrange multiplier jt denotes the value of one
extra unit of capital, and multiplier Jjt denotes the value of one extra worker. Solving the firm
problem yields standard optimality conditions.
Employment adjustment costs (EACs) are a major part of the firm problem. EACs tend to
be convex in the literature that uses aggregate data, but they tend to be linear and contain a
fixed costs component in the literature that uses disaggregated (firm-level) data.18 Our historical
data refer to regional labor markets and are, hence, accompanied by an intermediate degree of
aggregation. Therefore, we treat the amount of cost convexity as a parameter that we calibrate
below and also add fixed costs per worker to our specification of EACs. Fixed costs emerge
from recruiting and on-the-job training of new workers but also from incumbent workers' fringe
benefits, such as sick leave, health insurance and pensions. We use the following functional form
for EACs with non-negative parameters 0, 1, and 2 (omitting the j subscript):
C(Vt, Nt, qt) = 0Nt +
1
2
(exp[2(qtt
- )/] - 1)Nt . (17)
Here, t denotes the vacancy rate Vt/Nt and qtt denotes the hiring rate, which equals  in
steady state. Adjustment costs are proportional to employment and increase in the hiring rate
18 For aggregate data, Yashiv (2000) and Yashiv (2006) use adjustment costs that are convex (cubic) in vacancies
and new workers; Merz and Yashiv (2007) use a generalized convex cost function that increases in the hiring
rate; and Gertler, Sala, and Trigari (2008) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2013) apply quadratic
adjustment costs to hiring new workers. For firm-level data, Yaman (2011) estimates linear EACs; Bloom (2009)
and Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis (2007) estimate linear EACs with a strong fixed cost component; and Dolfin
(2006) demonstrates the relevance of fixed costs per worker.
25
to capture costs for training and integrating new workers into the workforce.19 Parameter 2,
which we interpret as firms' propensity to not adjust employment, governs costs convexity. A
convenient property of equation (17) is that it decouples the model's steady state (depending on
0 and 1) from the model's dynamics (also depending on 2). This property, which follows from
incorporating fixed costs per worker and expressing the hiring rate relative to its steady-state
value, simplifies parameter calibration below.
In every period, firm j bargains with its workers over the wage. We assume that the wage
is determined by Nash bargaining and thus maximizes the weighted product (Wt
- Qt)J1-
jt
,
which comprises a worker's net surplus from work Wt
- Qt and the firm's net surplus from one
extra worker Jjt. The bargaining process yields the surplus sharing rule
Wt
- Qt =

1 - 
Jjt , (18)
where 0 <  < 1 denotes a worker's share of the total surplus from creating the job, Jjt+Wt
-Qt.
Non-employed workers who participate in the labor market in region H are matched to firms
in this region through the regional matching function M(St, Vt). Its first argument refers to
the number of workers in region H who search for jobs, St = Ut + Mt. Its second argument
Vt refers to the aggregate number of vacancies. We have assumed that regional labor markets
are segregated, and thus postulate two regional matching functions instead of one aggregate
matching function.20
We define labor market tightness as the ratio of aggregate vacancies over workers searching
for jobs, t = Vt/St, and the job-filling rate as matched workers over aggregate vacancies,
q(t) = M(St, Vt)/Vt. Rearranging the latter shows that the job-finding rate equals market
tightness times the job-filling rate, t = tq(t).
19We also used a more general specification of EACs that allows for vacancy posting costs. However, in no case
did we find that vacancy posting costs improved the fit of our model to the historical data. This is consistent
with Yashiv (2000) who also finds a predominant role of post-match EACs using data on the Israeli labor market.
Similarily, Silva and Toledo (2009) estimate that post-match EACs account for about 92% of both post-match
and pre-match EACs in US data.
20The assumption of segmented labor markets is common in the literature (see, for example, Epifani and Gancia
(2005) and Lkhagvasuren (2012)), and also describes the German labor market in the 1950s well. Communication
was still costly at that time, and the average household did not own a car or a telephone. Furthermore, we consider
two large regional labor markets, so that the average distance between two arbitrary locations within these labor
markets is large as well. Therefore, workers would have had to travel relatively great distances to reach the other
labor market for, for instance, a job interview.
26
4.5 Model solution
We consider an equilibrium with symmetric firms within each region and thus Vt = Vjt, Nt =
Njt, It = Ijt, Kt = Kjt, Jt = Jjt and t = jt. Furthermore, we use a Cobb Douglas technology,
Yt = F(Nt, Kt-1) = AN
t
K1-
t-1
, with A > 0 and 0 <  < 1; a Cobb Douglas matching function,
M(St, Vt) = S
t
V 1-
t
, with  > 0 and 0 <  < 1; and quadratic investment adjustment
costs, B(It/It-1) = b(It/It-1 - 1)2/2, with b  0. We solve the model numerically using the
deterministic extended path algorithm of Fair and Taylor (1983), as implemented in Adjemian,
Bastani, Karam´
e, Juillard, Maih, Mihoubi, Perendia, Ratto, and Villemot (2011). This algorithm
assumes perfect foresight and accounts for permanent shifts in variables and nonlinearities in
the model.
5 Model calibration and fit
We choose the parameters of the model in three steps. In the parametrization step, we set initial
conditions and expellee inflow rates to historical values and a first set of parameters to values
conventional in the literature. In the second step, we calibrate a second set of parameters by tar-
geting steady-state values of endogenous variables. In the third step, we calibrate the remaining
three parameters by minimizing the distance between the model's adjustment dynamics after
the expellee inflow and a subset of the historical time series described in Section 3. We use the
other historical time series as non-targeted moments to evaluate the model fit, and discuss in
Section 6.3 the model fit for plausible alternative parameter calibrations.
5.1 Parametrization
We set initial conditions and expellee inflow rates to the historical values in the upper panel
of Table 3. Relative regional population before the expellee inflow, P-1/P-1
, equals 54.4% in
historical data, after adjusting this data for population changes between 1939 and 1950 that are
unrelated to the expellee inflow (we describe the adjustment in footnote 15). Moreover, initial
regional capital stocks per capita, K-1/P-1 and K-1
/P-1
, start from below their steady-state
values to account for war-related capital damage. According to Krengel (1958), 19% of the West
German industrial capital stock was destroyed in the war. Regional expellee inflows are equal
to the regional expellee population on 31 December 1949, as shown in column (2) of Table 2,
after expressing the regional expellee population relative to the West German population. No

expellees arrive after period t = 0 in the model, as the inflow was basically complete by the end
of 1949 (see Section 2).
We set the parameters in the lower panel of Table 3 to values that are either conventional in
the literature or taken from historical data. A time period corresponds to one quarter and hence
the value of the discount factor  implies a 4% annual interest rate. The value of the depreciation
rate  implies a 10% annual capital depreciation rate. The values of workers' bargaining power
 and the elasticity of matches to vacancies 1 -  are taken from Gertler and Trigari (2009).
The value of the magnitude of investment adjustment costs b falls into the range estimated
in Christiano, Trabrandt, and Walentin (2010). The value of the separation rate  yields the
average monthly separation rate of 1.8% that we observe in historical data on West Germany
for 1950-1963.21
5.2 Targeting steady-state values
We calibrate a second set of parameters, summarized in Table 4, by targeting steady-state values
of endogenous variables. We consider a steady state that is symmetric in both regions. Therefore,
parameters in Table 4 apply to either region.
To calibrate unemployment benefit z in Table 4, we equate the unemployment rate in steady
21We calculate the rate by dividing the number of persons who became newly unemployed in a given month
by the number of employed persons in the previous months. Data come from the German employment agency
and are available once per quarter (i.e., we use monthly data that we observe only once per quarter). From
September 1955 onwards, the employment agency records inflows into the pool of job seekers instead of inflows
into unemployment. Employment data are no longer available for 1964-70.

state to its historical value in West Germany in 1963 and solve for z. We treat the 1963 value
as steady state, because the West German unemployment rate was as low as 0.8% in 1963 and
stayed almost constant until the early 1970s. To calibrate 1, which determines firms' expected
costs to hire the marginal worker, CV /q = 1/, we set the replacement ratio z/w to 51%. This
value corresponds to the average earnings replacement ratio between 1950 and 1970 of a single
unemployed beneficiary (Flora 1986). We calibrate 0, which equals average costs per worker
C/N, by assuming that expected costs to hire the marginal worker equal average costs per newly
hired worker, CV /q = C/M. This yields 0 = 1 and implies that average costs per newly hired
worker equal 56% of the quarterly wage in steady state. This value aligns well with existing
estimates.22
To calibrate the value of the matching efficiency  in Table 4, we target the quarterly job-
filling rate in West Germany between 1950 and 1970 (see Appendix A.3). Finally, we normalize
regional output per capita to unity and derive regional productivity A from this normalization.
5.3 Targeting adjustment dynamics
We calibrate the remaining three parameters by targeting a subset of the historical time series
described in Section 3. These parameters are workers' propensity to participate in the labor
market e0, their propensity to migrate 1/a and firms' propensity not to adjust employment 2.
These "propensity parameters" do affect the model's adjustment dynamics to the expellee inflow,
but they do not affect the model's steady state. The steady state is independent of the propensity
to participate e0 and the propensity to migrate 1/a, because we consider a steady state with full
22Using US data, Silva and Toledo (2009) report average costs per newly hired worker of close to 60% of the
quarterly wage in 1980. Using German data, Yaman (2011) estimates these costs at EUR 4,000 in the year 2000.
Relating this estimate to a gross monthly wage of EUR 2,551 in Germany in the year 2000 yields a cost estimate
of about 52% (computed as 4000/(3 × 2551)), which again is close to our calibration.
29
labor force participation and without expellee inflow and hence regional migration. It follows
from our functional form of EACs in equation (17) that the steady state is also independent of
2.
We calibrate the propensity parameters by minimizing the distance between the model's
simulated adjustment path after the expellee inflow and the historical time series (see Redding
and Sturm (2008) for a similar calibration approach). We measure distance as D =  W. The
vector  is n × 1, and each of its elements j denotes the mean absolute difference between a
variable in the model and the historical data,
j =
100
T - t0
T
t=t0
abs(yt
- ydata
t
) , (19)
using yt to denote a generic variable. W is a diagonal matrix that weighs the contribution of a
variable to D by the inverse of this variable's mean in historical data. W is normalized so that
main diagonal elements sum to unity.
We use data on n = 4 variables, namely relative population Pt/Pt
, the average unemploy-
ment rate (Ut +Ut
)/(Lt +Lt
), average labor force participation (Lt +Lt
)/(Pt +Pt
) and relative
GDP per capita YtPt
/(Yt
Pt), for the period t0 = 1950.Q1 to T = 1962.Q4. We use the relative
population series that abstracts from influences other than regional migration (see Section 3.2),
since our model also abstracts from such influences. We also normalize the historical data on
relative GDP per capita and labor force participation by dividing each time series by its 1963
value. Much like the unemployment rate, we thus treat these 1963 values as steady-state values.23
This normalization aligns the data with the measurement suggested by our model, because in
the model we consider a steady state with the same level of GDP per capita in each region and
full participation. We linearly interpolate all historical data from annual to quarterly frequency.
Before turning to the model fit of the historical time series, we discuss the plausibility of
calibrated propensity parameters. The propensity to participate e0 that minimizes distance
D is equal to 0.33 and implies a long-run labor supply elasticity at the extensive margin with
respect to the real wage, d log(L/P)/d log w, of 0.14.24 The value is at the lower range of existing
23Two observations suggest that relative GDP per capita had reached its steady-state value by 1963. First,
relative GDP per capita stopped increasing by the end of the 1950s and stayed fairly constant throughout the
1960s (see Figure 5). Second, despite lower GDP per capita in region H than L, workers did not migrate from
region H to L in the 1960s. Moreover, participation was arguably in steady state in 1963, because there was
basically full employment at that time and the participation rate had hardly changed since 1957 (see Figure 2).
24In the model, this elasticity refers only to endogenous variables. Therefore, we consider a permanent reduction
in exogenous aggregate productivity, which reduces wt
by 1% and also reduces Lt
/Pt
. In the short run, the
reduction in Lt
/Pt
depends on many, if not all, model parameters, but it depends on only e0
in the long run.
30
estimates. In a meta-study of nine quasi-experimental studies, Chetty, Guren, Manoli, and Weber
(2012) find a steady-state elasticity at the extensive margin of 0.25, with estimates ranging from
0.13 to 0.43. The authors also survey four macro studies that exploit cross-country variation in
tax rates to estimate labor supply elasticities and find a mean steady-state elasticity of 0.17.
This is very close to the long-run labor supply elasticity implied by our calibration of e0.
Furthermore, we obtain a propensity to migrate 1/a of 0.065. This parameter implies that
conditional migration costs ¯
t = E[| < c
t
], which correspond to the average migration costs
of those workers who actually move between regions, are equal to 10.4% of annual steady-state
wage income when measured at the time of the expellee inflow. Lkhagvasuren (2012) reports
very similar moving costs equal to one-tenth of annual labor income. He obtains this value by
targeting the gross mobility rate in US regional data in a multi-location migration model. Bayer
and Juessen (2012) report higher costs of moving between US states of around two-thirds of an
average annual household income.
Finally, we obtain a propensity of firms not to adjust employment 2 of 5.06. This parameter
determines the elasticity of average costs per worker to (non-infinitesimal) deviations of the
hiring rate qtt from its steady-state value .25 This elasticity is equal to 1.43. We can use
the value of this elasticity to back out the degree of cost convexity implied by our calibration
for the alternative cost function 0(qtt/)3 , which is often estimated in related work.26 This
approach yields a value for the degree of convexity of the alternative cost function, 3, equal to
1.39. Mumtaz and Zanetti (2015) derive a DSGE model with EACs that depend on the hiring
rate and estimate a degree of cost convexity of 1.16, which is close to the value implied by
our calibration. Overall, therefore, our three calibrated propensity parameters are in line with
existing estimates in the literature.
5.4 Model fit of targeted and non-targeted moments
Figure 7 compares the historical data, which we target to calibrate the three propensity pa-
rameters, to the adjustment paths implied by the calibrated model. The figure shows that the
calibrated model fits the historical data remarkably well, both qualitatively and quantitatively,
even though we use only three parameters to optimize fit.
25 With 0
= 1
, we obtain that the elasticity (Ct/Nt-C/N)/(C/N)
(qtt-)/
= (exp[2(qtt-)/]-1)/2
(qtt-)/
and thus, for a
given change in the hiring rate, is indeed determined by 2
.
26 The elasticity is [(qt
t
/)3 - 1]/[(qt
t
- )/] and, hence, determined by 3
(for a given change in the hiring
rate).

In particular, the model fits the initial magnitude and persistent decline of the historical av-
erage unemployment rate (Panel A). Unemployment increases because expellees arrive in either
region without a job, and unemployment remains persistently high because expellees and unem-
ployed native workers only gradually move into employment. The persistence of unemployment
implied by the model depends, in particular, on firms' propensity not to adjust employment 2.
The model also fits the large discouraged worker effect (Panel B), which reduces the historical
labor force participation rate to roughly 95% of its (calibrated) equilibrium rate. Labor force
participation is slightly less persistent than the unemployment rate, again in line with the
historical data. The evolution of labor market participation in the model depends to a large
degree on workers' propensity to participate e0.
32
Furthermore, the model captures the gradual decline in relative population of region H to L
after the expellee inflow (Panel C). Relative population declines because non-employed workers,
motivated by higher wages and job-finding rates in region L, migrate from region H to L. Ongoing
migration along with faster capital accumulation in region H first attenuates regional differences
in wages and job-finding rates, and eventually eliminates migration incentives altogether.
The model also explains the quintessence of relative GDP per capita dynamics (Panel D).
Upon impact, relative GDP per capita in region H decreases sharply as unemployment soars,
and then slowly reverts to its pre-inflow level. Figure 7 shows, however, that the model tends to
overestimate both relative population and relative GDP per capita in region H during transition.
The model fit of both time series depends on workers' propensity to migrate 1/a. While a higher
propensity improves the model's fit of relative population by increasing regional migration, it
worsens the fit of the catch-up process in relative GDP per capita. We return to this point in
our robustness checks in Section 6.3.
Figure 8 evaluates the model fit of the historical time series that we did not target to
calibrate the propensity parameters. Evidently, the calibrated model fits the initial magnitude
and persistent decline of both regional unemployment rates remarkably well (Panels A and B).
The good fit of the regional dimension of the data is reassuring, given that this dimension takes
center stage in our subsequent analysis. The model also portrays the relative native population
remarkably well (Panel C). Again, this is reassuring since, below, we are mainly interested in
the effects of the expellee inflow on labor market adjustments of native inhabitants.
The model also replicates the decline in the relative population of expellees qualitatively,
but it falls short of replicating this decline quantitatively (Panel D in Figure 8). Effectively, as
shown in Panel C of Figure 7, the model overestimates total relative population after the mid-
1950s because it predicts too little regional migration of expellees for that period. Improving
the model's fit of relative expellee population without compromising the fit of relative native
population would require a more elaborate model, say one with differences in migration costs
between native inhabitants and expellees. In our model, expellees are more likely to migrate
than native inhabitants, because expellees are more likely to be unemployed at the beginning of
the adjustment process.27
27 How strongly these different initial conditions of native inhabitants versus expellees affect the migration rate
of each group depends on the propensity to migrate 1/a. A small propensity to migrate, for instance, downplays
the role of different initial conditions, because it implies that many of those who are initially unemployed in region
H do not migrate.

6 Main results on the labor market effects of the expellee inflow
We have shown that the calibrated model explains the empirical facts surprisingly well. In this
section, we use this model to address our two research questions. Subsection 6.1 discusses how
quickly and by what margins regions H and L adjust to the expellee inflow, and Subsection 6.2
quantifies the effect of the inflow on native labor income. Finally, Subsection 6.3 shows that our
main results are robust to various changes in the model calibration.
6.1 Margins of labor market adjustment
This subsection shows that regional migration is an important margin through which regional
labor markets adjust to the expellee inflow. We find that almost a third of the initial increase of
34
the population in the high-inflow region H is eventually absorbed through migration to the low-
inflow region L. This finding contrasts with conclusions from parts of the migration literature
that do not ascribe a major role to regional migration as an adjustment margin. We also show
that the adjustment processes of native inhabitants and expellees differ dramatically from each
other because the two groups start from different labor market states.
We consider employment, unemployment, non-participation, and regional net migration as
the adjustment margins in the labor market and measure the relative contribution of a margin
by tracing out how the expellee inflow affects this margin in the course of time. Recall that
population in region H evolves as Pt = Pt-1 + Xt + Gt
- Gt. Combining this equation with the
identity Pt = Nt + Ut + Rt and taking first differences yields
Xt = Nt + Ut + Rt + Gt
- Gt
, (20)
where  denotes the difference operator, i.e., Nt = Nt
- Nt-1. Equation (20) shows that the
expellee inflow Xt into region H can be decomposed into changes in employment Nt of both
native workers and expellees, unemployment Ut, non-participation Rt, and into net migration
Gt
- Gt
.
Cumulating equation (20) over the time horizon T yields T
t=0
Xt = T
t=0
(Nt + Ut +
Rt +Gt
-Gt
). After simplifying this equation and dividing it by the cumulative expellee inflow
(which reduces to X0 as long as expellees enter only in period zero), we obtain

This decomposition expresses the cumulative change in employment, unemployment, non-
participation and net migration between the time period before the inflow and period T relative
to the overall expellee inflow. Therefore, the decomposition measures the relative contribution
of each margin and adds up to one.
We can learn more about the economic adjustment mechanisms by splitting decomposition
(21) into one decomposition for the native population and another decomposition for expellees.
Computing the decomposition for the native population yields:

Here, each margin refers to native workers only. NNT , for instance, denotes native employment
35
at time T. Since the native population experiences no exogenous inflow, the four adjustment
margins on the right-hand side of equation (22) add up to zero. We obtain the decomposition
for expellees by subtracting the decomposition for the native population (22) from decomposi-
tion (21).
Furthermore, we express each decomposition relative to its corresponding decomposition in
a counterfactual scenario, in which we set the expellee inflow to zero. This isolates the effects
of the expellee inflow from the effects of the war-related damage of regional capital stocks.
Accordingly, in the counterfactual scenario we ignore the expellee inflow shock and compute
the model's adjustment dynamics that would have emerged had the economy been hit by the
destruction of regional capital stocks only.
Figure 9 shows, separately for region H and L, the relative contribution of each adjustment
margin in the overall population (Panels A and B), the native population (Panels C and D),
and the expellee population (Panels E and F). Relative contributions are shown for each time
horizon T from the time of the expellee inflow until 1965.
Three main findings emerge from the decompositions. First, the unemployment and non-
participation margins dominate the adjustment process for the overall population in the early
years after the shock, whereas the employment and migration margins dominate this process in
later years. This is true for each region (see Panel A for region H and Panel B for region L). In
later years, the contribution of the migration margin is sizable. At the end of the adjustment
process, migration has contributed about one-third to the cumulative labor market adjustment
of region H.
Second, it takes regional labor markets at least a decade to approach the new steady state.
Essentially, the adjustment of the unemployment margin to the expellee inflow was completed
after ten years in region H and after 11.5 years in region L, i.e., when 90% of the gap between
unemployment at the time of the inflow and unemployment in the terminal steady state has
been closed. The adjustment process takes longer in region L, because the ongoing migration
from H to L constitutes another, endogenous, inflow into unemployment in region L.
Third, the adjustment process of native workers differs quite dramatically from the process
of expellees (compare Panels C and E for region H and Panels D and F for region L). The
reason for the markedly different adjustment processes of native workers and expellees is that
both groups start from very different initial labor market states. While most native workers are
initially employed, all expellees are initially non-employed. Our results show that the different

E and F). Each decomposition is expressed relative to the corresponding decomposition in a counterfactual
scenario, in which we set the expellee inflow to zero. See Section 6.1 for further explanation.
initial conditions are crucial in shaping the labor market experiences of the two groups in the
wake of the shock.
In particular, native employment decreases in each region at the beginning of the adjustment
process, with job separations of native workers outnumbering new matches in the first few
quarters after the shock (see Panels C and D). Native employment in region H reaches a minimum
nine quarters after the shock. When measured at that time, 4.65 native workers lose their job for
any ten expellees who arrive in region H. This minimum employment effect is robust to various
modifications in our model calibration (see Section 6.3). Of the 4.65 native workers who lose
their job, 1.59 leave the labor force, 2.23 enter the unemployment pool and 0.83 leave region
37
H for region L.28 The unemployment rate of native workers equals 9.51%. The large negative
employment effect that we find is broadly consistent with recent evidence in Glitz (2012). He
studies the immigration of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
to Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall and finds that in the short run, 3.1 native workers
lose their jobs for every ten immigrants that find employment.
Furthermore, four years after the expellee inflow, migration accounts for one-third of the
decrease in region H's native employment, and after 15 years it accounts for the entire decrease.
The migration margin dominates the unemployment and non-participation margins after six
years. At the end of the adjustment process, 1.75 native workers have left region H for any ten
expellees who arrive.
Native migrants expand the labor market in region L (see Panel D). Since native migrants
arrive without a job, they initially add to the unemployment and non-participation pools.29 Over
time, however, native migrants find jobs and eventually increase native employment in region
L, whereas native employment in region H falls permanently.
In contrast to the native population, expellees are gradually absorbed into employment,
with their inflows into employment exceeding their outflows from employment over the entire
adjustment path (see Panels E and F). This process is faster in region L than in region H
because the job-finding rate remains higher in the low-inflow region L. Two years after the
shock, expellee employment already stands at 101% in region L but at only 69% in region H
(relative to the regional expellee inflow). Migration plays a relatively small, but non-trivial, role
in the adjustment process of expellees.
28 Native workers in our model adjust to the expellee inflow in a way that closely resembles the adjustment
that the literature on how regional labor markets adjust to local labor demand shocks predicts in the wake of a
negative demand shock (see, for example, Blanchard and Katz (1992), Decressin and Fatas (1995), Lkhagvasuren
(2012), Dao, Furceri, and Loungani (2014), and Beyer and Smets (forthcoming)). The literature on labor demand
shocks focuses on region-specific shocks. Our historical shock, in contrast, hits both regions, although to a very
different degree, and thus convolutes aggregate and region-specific components. In additional unreported work,
we thus decompose the historical shock in a common and a region-specific component and quantify the relative
contribution of the adjustment margins for the region-specific component. The decomposition, which can be
obtained upon request, supports our conclusion: Native workers adjust to the region-specific component of the
expellee inflow in a way that closely resembles the labor market adjustments after a negative labor demand
shock. In general, our results add to the results in the literature on labor demand shocks, because our strategy
for identifying the role of regional migration combines a natural experiment with dynamic search and matching
theory and therefore differs from the predominant strategy in this literature, which relies on imposing exogeneity
assumptions in time-series VAR models.
29Panels C and D in Figure 9 show that the maximum decline in native employment is slightly larger in region
L than region H when denominated by the initial regional expellee inflow. Alternatively, we can denominate the
same cumulative change in regional native employment by the regional native population before the expellee
inflow. This alternative denomination implies that out of one hundred native workers who lived in region H before
the shock, 15.60 lose their job nine quarters after the shock. The corresponding statistic for region L is much
smaller and equals 7.18 native workers.
38
The adjustment of expellees qualitatively resembles the adjustment of the overall population.
However, relative to the overall population, expellees adjust much more via employment rather
than migration. Native adjustment makes up for this difference between expellees and the overall
population. That is, out of those native workers who lose their job in the wake of the expellee
inflow, migration is the predominant margin in the long run (see Panel C).
6.2 The effects of the expellee inflow on native labor income
We have shown that native workers experience an increased probability of non-participation and
unemployment along the adjustment path, and respond to the expellee inflow by moving from
region H to L. These adjustment processes affect natives' expected lifetime labor income, and
quantifying this income effect is the focus of this subsection.30 We dissect the overall income
effect by income type and by a worker's initial labor market status, and also compute the income
effect for each point in time along the adjustment path. Therefore, we significantly extend the
existing literature that mainly focuses on the effect of immigration on native workers' wage
income at a given point in time.
We find that the expellee inflow reduces expected discounted lifetime income of native workers
by modest 1.38%, despite the large and long-lasting adjustment processes described in Section
6.1. However, per-period income effects in the first years after the expellee inflow are up to
four times larger than the overall effect on lifetime income. We also find that in region H, the
decrease in lifetime wage income is more than twice as high as the decrease in overall lifetime
labor income. Workers mitigate this loss in wage income by drawing upon other types of income
such as unemployment or home benefits. Furthermore, we show that income losses are largest
for native workers who are non-employed in region H at the time of the expellee inflow.
6.2.1 Overall treatment effect on expected discounted lifetime income
Table 5 reports the treatment effects of the expellee inflow on the expected discounted lifetime
income (EDI) of native workers. The treatment effect, T0, is the percentage difference between
a worker's EDI in the historical scenario, Z0, and her EDI in a counterfactual scenario without
30 In our partial equilibrium model, we implicitly divide a household into workers, consumers and shareholders
and focus our analysis on workers, but not on consumers or shareholders. Accordingly, our analysis is silent about
who owns what share of the economy-wide capital stock and, hence, about the effects of the expellee inflow on
capital income.
39
expellee inflow, Z0, at the time of the shock:
T0 = 100(Z0 - Z0)/Z0 . (23)
In both the historical and the counterfactual scenario, the economy starts from a capital stock
below the steady state to account for war damage.
Z0 denotes a generic income measure that depends on a worker's labor market state at the
time of the shock. For instance, the EDI of a native worker employed in region H equals the
value of employment W0 in region H (see equation (12)), so that Z0 = W0 in this case. Since
a worker can be in one of six different states (employed, unemployed, or non-participating in
region H or region L), we also compute six worker-specific treatment effects in Table 5.
We augment worker-specific treatment effects by the treatment effect for the average native
worker in region H, the average native worker in region L, and the average native worker in
both regions. The EDI of the average native worker in region H, denoted by ZNt, weighs the
value of working by the (regional) share of natives who are employed, (LNt
- UNt)/PNt; the
value of unemployment by the share of natives who are unemployed, UNt/PNt; the value of
non-participation by the share of native workers who are non-participating, (1 - LNt/PNt); and
migration costs, ¯
t, by the native migration rate, GNt/PNt:

We compute a corresponding measure, ZNt
, for the average native worker in region L. The EDI
of the average native worker in both regions weighs ZNt and ZNt
by their population shares:
ZNt = (PNtZNt + PNt
ZNt
)/(PNt + PNt
) . (25)
The first main result in Table 5 is that the expellee inflow reduces the EDI of the average
native worker by 1.38%. This value is robust to various modifications in our model calibration
(see Section 6.3). Also, this value has no equivalent in the existing literature on immigration,
since the literature generally focuses on per-period income effects, which we consider below. The
second main result in the table is that the magnitude of income losses varies significantly with a
worker's initial location (region H or region L) and labor market status (employed, unemployed,
or non-participating).
Income losses are 45.4% larger for the average native worker in region H than for the average

worker in region L (1.73% compared with 1.19%). Interestingly, regional income losses are much
more similar to each other than regional expellee inflow rates, which differ by more than 100%.
This is because the asymmetric shock triggers migration from region H to region L, which
then diffuses the income effect of the asymmetric shock across regions. Nevertheless, regional
migration is not large enough to fully equalize income effects across regions. Positive migration
costs, in particular, prevent larger migration flows.
Furthermore, income losses in both regions are almost 40% higher for workers who are
unemployed at the time of the shock rather than employed (2.33% compared with 1.69% in region
H, and 1.57% compared with 1.16% in region L). This is because the expellee inflow decreases
job-finding rates and hence the re-employment probability of unemployed native workers. In
contrast, employed natives only suffer from lower job-finding rates if they lose their jobs in later
periods.
6.2.2 Per-period and cumulative treatment effect
We analyze how income losses evolve over time by decomposing the overall treatment effect in
the EDI of the average native worker in both regions, ZNt, from Table 5 in two ways. The first
decomposition is the per-period treatment effect and shows in which period the treatment effect
is largest (in absolute terms); the second decomposition is the cumulative treatment effect and
shows how long it takes for the overall treatment effect to be realized.
We denote the per-period treatment effect in period t by PT t and define it as the difference
between period t income in the historical scenario, Zt
- Zt+1, and period t income in the

- Zt+1, expressed in terms of the average counterfactual income:
PT t = 100
[Zt
- Zt+1] - [Zt
- Zt+1]
(1 - )Z0
.
Panel A in Figure 10 shows that the per-period treatment effect in ZNt evolves non-
monotonically over time. On impact, the expellee inflow reduces historical per-period income of
the average native worker in both regions by 3.28% relative to counterfactual income. As more
and more native workers become unemployed or leave the labor force over time (see Section
6.1 for the labor market dynamics of native workers), the per-period treatment effect declines
even further, reaching a minimum value of -5.34% in nine quarters after the shock, and slowly
dissolving thereafter. The large (in absolute terms) per-period treatment effects in the early
years after the expellee inflow are consistent with the considerably smaller overall treatment
effect, since the latter averages the discounted per-period effects over a worker's lifetime, i.e.,
T0 = (1 - )(PT 0 + PT 1 + 2PT 2 + . . . ).
Since it takes more than a decade for per-period treatment effects to vanish, it also takes
a long time for the overall treatment effect to be realized fully. We summarize this speed of
adjustment in a cumulative treatment effect for the average native worker in both regions. This
cumulative treatment effect corresponds to the overall treatment effect truncated at date t,
CT t = 100 [Z0 - t+1Zt+1] - [Z0 - t+1Zt+1] /Z0 .
Truncation implies that historical and counterfactual income are compared up to date t only and
42
that CT t approaches the overall treatment effect T0 as t becomes large. The ratio of cumulative
to overall treatment effect, CT t/T0, then yields the fraction of the overall treatment effect that
is realized over a certain time horizon of the adjustment process, say within the first five years.
Panel B in Figure 10 plots CT t/T0 for the income of the average native worker, and shows
that the overall treatment effect builds up only very gradually over time. Five years after the
expellee inflow, the cumulative treatment effect still amounts to less than two-thirds of the overall
treatment effect, and it takes another ten years for the remaining effect to be fully realized. This
result shows that per-period income has to be analyzed over a long period of time in order to
obtain a full picture of the overall income effect of the expellee inflow.
6.2.3 Contribution of income types to the treatment effect
Workers receive their overall income from various income types, such as regional wages, unem-
ployment benefits and home benefits. Accordingly, another decomposition of the overall treat-
ment effect isolates the contribution of each income type to the overall effect.
To obtain this decomposition, we derive the analytical result that the EDI of the average
native worker in both regions, ZNt in equation (25), has a "direct form" that shows the contri-
bution of each income type to overall income:
ZN0 =

According to equation (26), the EDI of the average native worker ZN0 is an infinite weighted
sum of wages wt and wt
, unemployment benefits z and z , average home benefits ¯
ht and ¯
ht
, and
migration costs. In each period t, weights on all income types (ignoring weights on migration
costs) sum to unity. They can thus be interpreted as the unconditional likelihood of the average
native worker receiving a particular income type at time t. The direct form equation allows us to
compute the contribution of one specific income type, say, wage income, to the overall treatment
effect as the difference in expected discounted lifetime wage income between the historical and
the counterfactual scenarios as a percentage of the overall treatment effect.
Table 6 shows this decomposition. A striking result in this table is that the decline in ex-
pected lifetime wage income in region H amounts to 220% of the overall decline in native income.
Expected wage income in region H decreases for two reasons. First, wages decrease temporarily

in region H. Second, the likelihood of the average native worker being employed in region H
decreases as well, because of migration to region L and because of temporarily higher unemploy-
ment and non-participation rates. Therefore, as shown in the table, the large decline in wage
income in region H is partly offset by the other income types available to workers, namely by
unemployment benefits, home benefits and wage income in region L.
While we focus on the income effect of immigration, the literature often focuses on the
wage elasticity of immigration. The wage elasticity in our model, computed as (d log(wt) -
d log(wt))/d log(Pt), equals -0.12 and -0.16 in region H and L, respectively, when measured at
the time of the shock. The elasticity decreases slightly in the first few quarters after the shock and
gradually approaches zero thereafter. Our short-run wage elasticities are slightly lower than most
estimates in the literature and thus imply larger wage effects of immigration. In fact, Friedberg
and Hunt (1995) and Kerr and Kerr (2011) report that most studies find wage elasticities of
-0.1 or higher. However, Borjas (2003) finds much higher wage effects of immigration, pointing
to a wage elasticity of between -0.3 and -0.4. Either way, our analysis highlights the fact that
estimates of the wage elasticity generally depend on the time elapsed since immigration.
6.3 Robustness checks
This section tests how plausible changes to our baseline calibration affect the model fit, the values
of propensity parameters, and the effects of the expellee inflow on native income and employment
(as discussed in the previous two subsections). The robustness checks focus, in particular, on
44
pre-existing differences between regions H and L that we have not incorporated in our baseline
calibration. Robustness checks show that changes to our baseline calibration can slightly improve
the model fit but typically have no marked effect on calibrated propensity parameters and also
have no income and employment effects. If anything, we find that the adverse effects on native
income and employment in our baseline calibration are conservative estimates.
We conduct five robustness checks and report for each check our distance measure of model
fit, the calibrated propensity parameters, the treatment effect on native income (in %), and
the minimum effect on native employment in region H along the adjustment path (for any ten
expellees who arrive in region H). All statistics are in Table 7, along with the initial conditions
on regional capital stocks and productivity (the first panel recalls the corresponding results for
the baseline calibration).
A. Asymmetric initial capital stocks. Our baseline calibration abstracts from regional
differences in war-related damage to the capital stock. However, such differences might provide
an alternative explanation, other than asymmetric expellee inflows, for the regional adjustment
dynamics observed historically. Robustness check A., therefore, accounts for regional differences
in war damage, and sets initial regional capital stocks in region H and L to 88% and 77% of
their steady-state values, respectively.31
Asymmetric initial capital stocks worsen model fit (see Panel A. of Table 7). Since region H
suffered less from damage than region L (see Section 3), regional differences in war damage
increase ceteris paribus relative GDP per capita in region H and generate regional migration
from L to H. This is at odds with the empirical facts, such as migration from region H to region L,
hence making it more difficult for the model to fit the data. Importantly, regional differences
in capital destruction reduce the effects of expellees on native income and employment only
marginally.
31We calculate these initial regional capital stocks by using the fact that damage d of the nationwide capital
stock is a weighted sum of damage of regional capital stocks, i.e., d(K + K ) = dH
K-1
+ dL
K-1
. We transform
this equation into per capita terms and solve it for dH
using the observation that dL
= 2dH
, which follows from
the historical data on regional war damage in Table 2. This yields dH
= d(1 + P-1
/P-1
)/(2 + P-1
/P-1
). Our
calibration implies d = 0.19 and P-1
/P-1
= 0.544.

average labor force participation, and relative GDP per capita (see Section 5). 3 Propensity parameters are workers' propensity to migrate 1/a, workers'
propensity to participate in the labor market e0

. 4 Treatment effect TN0

46
B. Regional productivity gap. Our baseline calibration also abstracts from regional pro-
ductivity differences. However, catch-up in productivity between regions H and L might be a
plausible alternative explanation for the catch-up in GDP per capita that we observe in the
data. Robustness check B., therefore, mimics productivity catch-up in the model by introducing
a time-varying productivity shock At in region H, keeping productivity A in region L constant.
Unfortunately, reliable regional productivity data are unavailable for the historical time
period but have to be inferred under strong assumptions (which is why we do not consider
productivity differences in the baseline calibration). We use data reported in Waidlein (2013)
and set the initial value of the productivity shock equal to the gap in total factor productivity
between region H and L in 1950, normalized by the corresponding 1963 value.32 This yields that
initial productivity in region H is 5.2% lower than in region L. We assume that this gap closes
linearly until 1963.
Regional productivity catch-up significantly increases model fit (see Panel B. of Table 7), be-
cause the negative productivity shock in region H constitutes another ­ and relatively persistent
­ motive for regional migration. Therefore, relative population declines more strongerly and thus
moves closer to the data than in the baseline calibration. The migration propensity declines sig-
nificantly from 0.065 to 0.037, since a lower migration propensity is now sufficient for the model
to match the regional migration data. The effect on native income decreases from -1.38% to
-1.75%, because productivity in region H is now temporarily lower than in the baseline. Firms
in this region thus pay lower wages and have less incentive to hire new workers.
C. Alternative data classification. Robustness checks A. and B. directly incorporate re-
gional differences into the model. Robustness check C., in contrast, maintains the symmetry as-
sumption of the baseline calibration but uses an alternative data classification of federal states.
This alternative classification levels out pre-existing differences in both the degree of industri-
alization and in war damage. It excludes Bremen, Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia from
region L, as these three states are responsible for the observed pre-existing differences between
regions H and L (see Table 2). Appendix A.2 documents the empirical facts for the alterna-
tive classification and shows that they are qualitatively similar to the facts for the baseline
32Waidlein (2013) reports data on two measures of total factor productivity for German states. We aggregate
the data to the level of our regions H and L, using population as weights, and take the average of the two
measures. Given data constraints, exact values should be interpreted cautiously. For instance, Waidlein (2013)
has to approximate regional capital stocks from nationwide capital stocks and regional industry employment, as
there exists no regional capital data before 1960.
47
classification.
The model fit improves considerably if we use the alternative classification of regions (see
Panel C. of Table 7), and calibrated propensity parameters remain surprisingly close to the
baseline calibration. The same is true of the effect of the expellee inflow on native income and
employment. The income effect remains virtually unchanged despite the fact that significantly
fewer native workers migrate endogenously from the high- to the low-inflow region than in the
baseline classification (see Appendix A.2 for the details).
D. Initial capital stock at steady state. Our baseline calibration sets initial regional
capital stocks 19% below their steady-state values to account for war-related damage of the
capital stock. However, the Nazi era also witnessed massive investment in industrial capacity
that partly made up for later war damage. In fact, the magnitudes of investment and war damage
­ and the degree to which the former out-weighted the latter ­ is still debated among economic
historians (Eichengreen and Ritschl 2009, Vony´
o 2012). Robustness check D., therefore, initializes
capital stocks at their steady-state values rather than below them.
This change in calibration leads to a slight deterioration in model fit (see Panel D. of Table 7).
While the migration propensity 1/a remains virtually unchanged, participation and employment
adjustment propensities e0 and 2 increase moderately. When firms maintain a higher capital
stock, they absorb the expellee inflow faster and therefore unemployment declines relative to
the baseline calibration. Lower unemployment also makes it more attractive for workers to
participate in the labor market. The higher propensities e0 and 2 offset both effects. However,
a greater reluctance on the part of firms to adjust employment (higher 2) also increases the
duration of native non-employment and therefore amplifies the effect on native income and
employment.
E. Discount data on relative GDP per capita. Section 3 pointed out that measuring
pre-war regional GDP per capita is fraught with problems. Robustness check E., therefore, re-
calibrates the propensity parameter by discounting the weight of relative GDP per capita in
the distance function by 50%. This change in calibration increases the migration propensity 1/a
from 0.065 to 0.080. Recall that in the baseline calibration, further increases in 1/a improve
the model's fit of relative population but worsens the fit of relative GDP per capita. Therefore,
when the GDP time series is discounted, a higher 1/a improves overall model fit. The effects of
48
the expellee inflow on native income and employment remain virtually unchanged.
7 Counterfactual immigration experiments
Motivated in large part by the policy discussions surrounding Europe's current refugee crisis,
we conduct four counterfactual immigration experiments, which explore the predictions of our
structural model under different parameter calibrations. First, we reduce the magnitude of the
expellee inflow. Second, we vary the initial regional distribution of expellees. Third, we vary
the timing of the expellee inflow, and spread it over time. Fourth, we change the propensity
of workers to migrate between regions. The counterfactual experiments suggests that economic
policies that change the nature of the immigrant inflow can have important consequences for the
magnitude of native income losses and labor market adjustments but are unlikely to markedly
speed up the adjustment process.
A. Counterfactual magnitude of expellee inflow. The first counterfactual experiment
reduces the overall expellee inflow rate from its historical 16.3% to a counterfactual 3.2% or
1.3%. The 1.3% inflow rate corresponds to the inflow rate of refugees to Germany in 2015, and
the 3.2% inflow rate corresponds to the sum of the inflow rate of non-refugees in 2014 and the
inflow rate of refugees in 2015 (the inflow rate of non-refugees for 2015 is not yet available). The
experiment only varies the overall magnitude of the expellee inflow; the regional distribution of
the expellee inflow remains the historical distribution. The results are in Panel A. of Table 8
(the first panel recalls the corresponding results for the historical scenario).
Lower inflow rates are associated with lower income losses, since in our model immigration
has unambiguously negative effects on the income of native workers. The income loss of the
average native worker in both regions, as measured by the overall treatment effect on the EDI,
decreases from 1.38% to 0.30% when we decrease the overall inflow rate (X0 + X0
)/(P0 + P0
)
from 16.3% to 3.2% (see column (1)). The overall income loss decreases further to 0.12% when
we decrease the inflow rate to 1.3%. In fact, the relationship between the magnitude of the
expellee inflow rate and native lifetime income losses is approximately linear.
Lower inflow rates increase expellee income more than native income (compare columns (1)
and (4)), because expellees are initially non-employed and, therefore, compete directly with other
expellees. We measure the effect on expellee income by the percentage difference between the
EDI of the average expellee and the EDI of the average native in the case without any expellees.
49
The counterfactual experiment also shows that reducing expellee inflow rates amplifies re-
gional differences in native income losses (see columns (2) and (3)). In the historical scenario,
the income loss of the average native worker is 45.4% higher in region H than in region L. This
relative difference increases to 95.5% and 100% for an overall inflow rate of 3.2% and 1.3%,
respectively. Intuitively, lower inflow rates reduce the value of workers migrating from region H
to L but do not affect migration costs. As a consequence, regional migration flows, as measured
by cumulative net migration over the total expellee inflow into region H, decrease (column (10)),
and regional differences in the overall treatment effect become more important.
Finally, lower expellee inflow rates also reduce minimum per-period income losses (columns
(6) and (7)) and average unemployment rates in the first ten years of adjustment (columns
(8) and (9)). However, even with lower inflow rates, the adjustment process of regional labor
markets takes time. The duration of adjustment, as measured by the number of quarters that
it takes for 90% of the overall treatment effect to be realized, decreases only modestly from 35
to 28 quarters when the inflow rate falls from 16.3% to 3.2%. This finding suggests that even at
more modest levels of immigration, researchers need to analyze a relatively long time period to
obtain a complete picture of the overall effect of immigration.
B. Counterfactual initial regional distribution of expellees. Counterfactual B. varies
the initial regional distribution of expellees, keeping the overall magnitude of the expellee inflow
at its historical level. We either distribute all expellees into one region, or distribute expellees so
that regional inflow rates, X0/P-1 and X0
/P-1
, are identical.33 Identical inflow rates imply that
X0/(X0 + X0
) equals P-1/(P-1 + P-1
) and thus 0.35. In our model, the distribution with equal
inflow rates mimics today's policy of distributing refugees across German states according to
local population size. Similar distribution quotas are also the subject of animated debate within
the European Union.34
The results in Panel B. of Table 8 suggest that unequal inflow rates benefit the average
native worker at the expense of the average expellee worker. In fact, the income loss of the
average native worker in both regions is minimized (at 1.24%) when all expellees are distributed
to region H (see column (1)), the region with the smaller initial population size. This perhaps
33We denominate regional inflow rates by P-1
and P-1
rather than P0
and P0
to ensure that they are exogenous.
34In addition to population size, distribution quotas usually take economic indicators into account. The German
quota, for instance, allocates more refugees to states with higher tax income. However, regions in our model are
ex ante identical in per capita terms. Therefore, economic indicators do not carry additional information for the
distribution of expellees in our model, once differences in population size are accounted for.
50
surprising result is due to the fact that with positive migration costs, native inhabitants in region
L are partly shielded from the expellee inflow to region H. Distributing all expellees to region H,
in which there are relatively few native inhabitants, maximizes the number of natives shielded
from the negative effects of immigration. The income loss of the average expellee, in contrast,
is maximized (at -2.81% relative to the average native's EDI in the case without any expellee
inflow) when all expellees are distributed to region H (column (4)). This is because all expellees
then start in the congested labor market of region H with a small probability of finding a job
quickly.
The income loss of the average native worker in both regions is maximized (at 1.41%) when
expellees are distributed in proportion to the initial native population in each region. The pro-
portional distribution of expellees is thus the worst possible distribution from the perspective of
the average native worker in our model.35 The income loss of expellees, in contrast, is minimized
(at 1.99%) in that case. Our results also show that a proportional distribution levels out regional
differences in minimum per-period treatment effects (columns (6) and (7)) and unemployment
differentials (columns (8) and (9)) and thus might be considered a "fair distribution".
Panel B. of Table 8 also shows that we observe the longest duration of adjustment when all
expellees are distributed to region H, and the shortest duration when expellees are distributed
proportionally (column (5)). Distributing all expellees to the less populous region H maximizes
migration incentives, and thus increases the magnitude and persistence of regional migration
flows. In fact, half of the initial increase in the population of region H is eventually absorbed
through migration to region L if all expellees are distributed to region H (column (10)). Regional
migration adds to the persistence of the treatment effect in region L ­ as more expellees arrive
in region L in later periods, too ­ and hence increases the duration of adjustment.
C. Gradual inflow of expellees over time. Counterfactual C. explores the effects of a
gradual inflow of expellees, keeping the overall magnitude and distribution of the inflow at
historical values. That is, instead of considering a one-off inflow, we distribute the expellee inflow
over either three or ten years so that quarterly inflow rates, Xt/(Pt +Pt
) and Xt
/(Pt +Pt
), are
constant over time. Gradual intakes of refugees are common practice in many countries today.
35Clearly, our partial equilibrium analysis abstracts from a number of channels through which the regional
distribution of expellees might affect native income. The extreme initial distribution of expellees, for instance, de-
creases the employment probability of expellees and hence increases their dependency on unemployment benefits.
In general equilibrium, native workers will have to finance the benefits of unemployed expellees and thus have an
interest in high expellee employment. Such interest is absent in our partial equilibrium framework.
51
The UK, for instance, has recently agreed to take in 20,000 Syrian refugees but will spread the
intake over five years. Likewise, Norway has agreed to accept 8,000 refugees across a three-year
period.
The results in Panel C. of Table 8 suggest that a more gradual inflow of expellees markedly
reduces the income loss of native workers. The income loss decreases by almost 25% when the
expellee inflow is distributed over three years, and it more than halves when the expellee inflow
is distributed over ten years (see column (1)). A more gradual inflow has even stronger income
effects for expellees, since they suffer most from a congested labor market. The income loss of
the average expellee worker decreases by 35% and 62% when the expellee inflow is distributed
over three and ten years, respectively (column (4)).
The counterfactual also shows that a more gradual inflow increases the minimum per-period
treatment effect and keeps average unemployment rates down. Distributing the expellee inflow
over ten years reduces the average unemployment rate in the first ten years of adjustment from
7.29% to 4.61% in region H and from 4.85% to 3.16% in region L (columns (8) and (9)).
Overall, the counterfactual suggests that a more gradual inflow of immigrants can effectively
limit the negative effects of immigration. Of course, our model does not account for the ­
potentially large ­ costs of delayed entry for immigrants themselves.
D. Counterfactual migration costs. Counterfactual D. explores the effects of prohibitively
high and very low costs of inter-regional migration. These costs are determined by a, i.e., the
inverse propensity of workers to migrate. Varying these costs allows us to discern the role of
labor mobility in shaping the effects of the expellee inflow, and facilitates the extrapolation of
our results to settings in which regional labor markets are more or less integrated.
The results in Panel D. of Table 8 show that prohibitively high migration costs shield workers
in region L from the negative income effects of regional migration from region H to L. Therefore,
the income loss for the average native worker in region L decreases from 1.19% in the historical
scenario to 0.94% (column (3)). Conversely, natives in region H suffer from high migration costs,
as workers are no longer able to evade the poor labor market conditions in region H by moving
to region L. Consequently, the income loss for the average native worker in region H increases
from 1.73% to 2.14% (column (2)).

Notes: The table shows the effects on various outcome variables of varying the magnitude of the expellee inflow (Panel A.), the initial regional distribution of the expellee inflow (Panel
B.), the timing of the expellee inflow (Panel C.) and migration costs (Panel D.). Each counterfactual varies only one parameter at a time, keeping all other parameters at the values
described in Section 5. 1 The income of the average expellee is the percentage difference between the average expellee's EDI upon arrival and the EDI of the average native in the case
without any expellee inflow. 2 The duration of adjustment is the number of quarters that it takes for 90% of the treatment effect in column (1) to be realized. 3 The minimum per-period
treatment effect is the minimum of the per-period treatment effect on native income (as described in Section 6.2.2) over the adjustment path. 4 Migration as an adjustment margin is
computed as cumulative net migration over the total expellee inflow into region H. 5 Not defined (division by zero).
53
Under very low migration costs, in contrast, native income losses in both regions converge to
1.41%. Workers in region L no longer benefit from a less congested labor market, as unemployed
workers in region H can move at no cost and do so instantaneously until migration incentives are
exhausted. Therefore, the income loss for the average native worker in both regions is slightly
higher for very low migration costs than for prohibitively high migration costs (1.41% vs. 1.36%).
Expellees, however, benefit from lower migration costs, because their costs of bypassing the
congested labor market in region H fall. These findings mirror our conclusion from counterfactual
experiment B., i.e., shielding native workers in the low-inflow region L is beneficial for the average
native worker but detrimental for the average expellee.
8 Discussion and conclusion
This paper has analyzed how regional labor markets in West Germany adjusted over a period
of more than two decades to the inflow of eight million expellees after World War II. Three
key findings emerge. First, it took regional labor markets more than one decade to absorb the
expellee inflow. Second, the adjustment process was characterized by large differences in regional
unemployment rates and strong migration from the high- to the low-inflow region. Third, despite
these large and long-lasting adjustment processes, the average native worker experiences only a
modest loss in expected discounted lifetime income of 1.38%. Per-period losses in native income,
however, are much larger and can reach up to 5.34% in the short run. Workers who are non-
employed at the time of the inflow suffer the greatest losses.
Counterfactual immigration experiments suggest that economic policy interventions that
change the timing, regional distribution and magnitude of immigration can have important
consequences for native income losses and adjustment dynamics. We find that a more gradual
inflow of immigrants significantly reduces the incomes loss of native workers. A more equal
distribution of immigrants across regional labor markets, in contrast, benefits immigrants but
increases the income loss of the average native worker. The counterfactual experiments also
suggests that the adjustment process of regional labor markets takes considerable time even
under today's more modest levels of immigration. The duration of adjustment is still seven
years if we decrease the expellee inflow rate from its historical rate of 16.5% to 1.3% ­ a value
similar to Germany's inflow rate of refugees in 2015.
Our results shed light on the dynamic labor market effects of one of the largest forced pop-
54
ulation movements in history. But they also provide several relevant insights for the burgeoning
­ and largely static ­ empirical literature on the labor market effects of immigration. First, the
time elapsed since immigration matters greatly for the results of empirical studies on the labor
market effects of immigration. Not only do short-run effects of immigration differ greatly from
longer-run effects. The effects can also evolve non-monotonically over time. Therefore, estimated
short-run effects of immigration do not generally establish a bound on longer-run effects and
vice versa.
Second, empirical studies that use regional variation in inflow rates to estimate the effects
of immigration are more likely to obtain biased estimates, the more time has elapsed since
immigration. This is because, over time, regional migration will diffuse the effect of immigration
from high- to low-inflow regions. Low-inflow regions are then no longer a valid counterfactual
for high-inflow regions. The more unevenly initial inflows are distributed, the greater will be
the importance of regional migration as an adjustment mechanism. One way to account for this
diffusion effect of regional migration is through a structural model, such as the one developed
in this paper.
Third, estimated effects on wage income will, in general, exceed the overall income effects of
immigration. In our setting, the effects on wage income are actually twice as large as the effects
on overall income. This is because workers resort to other income sources outside the labor
market in response to deteriorating labor market conditions. This outcome suggests that the
literature's focus on wage income is fairly narrow and may benefit from including other income
sources.
At the most general level, our dynamic analysis ­ and the large discrepancy between lifetime
and per-period income effects that we find ­ reminds us of the simple fact that any static
analysis will necessarily provide no more than an incomplete snapshot of the overall benefits
and costs of immigration. A deeper understanding of the dynamic effects of immigration is,
therefore, essential for informing the in-depths policy debate on immigration. Future research
in this area might build productively on our theoretical framework, addressing several caveats
of our analysis.
First, our analysis assumes that there are no long-run effects of immigration on wages and
productivity, as we use a "standard" constant returns to scale production technology. Clearly,
the long-run effects of immigration, and thus also transitional dynamics, may differ under either
increasing or decreasing returns to scale. Economies of scale might, for instance, arise from high-
55
skilled migration fostering firm innovation and productivity (Kerr, Kerr, and Lincoln 2014).
Second, our analysis abstracts from skill differences between native workers and immigrants,
and thus from potentially important distributional consequences of immigration. This assump-
tion is justified in our context, where native workers and expellees compete as close substitutes
along the entire skill distribution. In contrast, today's migration flows are often concentrated
in specific parts of the skill distribution, so that skill differences become an essential model
ingredient.
Third, and related to the two previous points, our framework abstracts from potential positive
effects of immigration for native workers (though not for native capital owners). Such positive
effects can arise if, say, natives and immigrants differ in their skills or in their search costs (see,
for instance, Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014)). While our goal in this paper was to build the
most parsimonious model that can explain the historical data, and our specific historical episode
allows us to abstract from many differences between immigrants and native workers, some of
the simplifications may not be warranted in other settings.
Fourth, our analysis has focused on the relocation of workers, abstracting from the entry
and exit of firms in response to immigrant inflows (although we allow for capital accumulation).
Dustmann and Glitz (2015) have recently highlighted the importance of this adjustment channel
in a static framework, and it would be valuable to explore its dynamic implications.
Fifth, expellees and native workers face identical migration costs in our model. Expellees still
have a higher probability of migrating from one region to the other in our analysis, as they are
more likely to be unemployed at the beginning of the adjustment process. In general, however,
immigrants might be more willing to move than native workers because they have fewer social
and psychological ties in the host country and might thus face lower migration costs than native
inhabitants. Exploring the effects of differences in migration costs on the adjustment process
might, therefore, be a further promising avenue for future research.

A Data appendix
A.1 Regional differences in GDP per capita before the war
We use two proxies for regional differences in GDP per capita before the war. The first proxy uses
national income data from 1936, but is subject to the limitation that the states of the German
Reich, for which the income data is available, do not correspond to the later West German
states. We therefore had to approximate the values for the H and L regions (see footnote 12 for
the details).
The second proxy uses data on firm sales that come from published sales tax statistics
(Statistisches Bundesamt 1955a, Statistisches Bundesamt 1955b). Total sales are defined as
domestic deliveries and other services of a business for money and own consumption of the
business. The sales data have two advantages over the national income data. First, comparable
data on firm sales exist for both the pre- and the post-war periods (although, unfortunately, only
until 1955). Second, sales data are available at district level and can thus be precisely aggregated
to the federal state level (and thus also to the level of our two regions). On the downside, sales are
not a direct measure of production value, and certain exemptions for businesses with low revenues
apply. However, firm sales per capita correlate strongly with national income per capita.36 The
pre- to post-war changes in relative sales per capita between the two regions gives at least an
indication of the change in relative GDP per capita. As sales statistics are not available for 1939,
we use data for 1935, along with population figures for 1939.
36The correlation coefficient between sales per capita in 1935 and national income per capita in 1936 is 0.92
for the 19 regions of the German Reich, for which both types of data are available. And for 1950, the correlation
coefficient between sales and GDP of the nine West German states is 0.99.
62
A.2 Alternative regional data classification
This section shows that empirical facts are robust to the use of an alternative classification
of federal states that levels out pre-existing differences between the high- and the low-inflow
region. The alternative classification excludes Bremen, Hamburg, and North Rhine-Westphalia
from region L, as these three states are responsible for the differences in agricultural employment
and the degree of war damage that we observe for regions H and L (see Table 2).37 In what
follows, we will refer to the resulting geographical entity, which consists of Baden-W¨
urttemberg,
Hesse, and Rhineland-Palatinate, as region L'. We will refer to the excluded states of Bremen,
Hamburg, and North Rhine Westphalia as (L-L') region.38
Table 2 illustrates that regions H and L' are very similar not only in terms of pre-war
population growth and unemployment but also in terms of agricultural employment and war
damage. The agricultural employment share in region L' was only slightly lower than in region
H in 1939 (32.1% vs. 36.5%). Likewise, the share of destroyed flats, our measure of wartime
damage, was virtually identical in the two regions (12.1% and 12.8%). While regions H and L'
were thus similar in their pre-war economic structure and their degree of war damage, region L'
experienced a much smaller expellee inflow than region H (12.6% vs. 25.0%). The main problem
with using the alternative classification is that it excludes almost one-third of the West German
population.
Figure A1 shows that the empirical facts presented in Section 3 also prevail, at least quali-
tatively, when we compare the demographic and economic development of the H region to the
L' region rather than to the L region. As before, we consider relative population, relative GDP
per capita, and unemployment rates. On labor force participation, we use the same time series
as in our baseline classification, since participation data is only available at the national level.
Panel (a) shows the population size of region H relative to region L' from 1939 to 1970
(red line). The graph also shows how the relative population size of the two regions would have
evolved if the only reason for changes in the relative population size was regional migration
37North Rhine-Westphalia comprises the Ruhr region, Germany's pre-war industrial center. Therefore, only
14.1% of North Rhine-Westphalia's labor force was in agriculture before the war (compared to a national average
of 27.0%). North Rhine-Westphalia is not only highly industrialized but also highly urbanized and thus suffered
over-proportionally from war damage. The same is true for the city states of Bremen and Hamburg, which comprise
only urban areas, and had almost no agriculture in 1939.
38This alternative classification thus divides West Germany into three regions. In our two-region model, we
treat migration between regions H and L' as endogenous. To account for net migration flows between region H
and (L-L'), however, we treat them as exogenous and subsume them into Xt
. Thus, Xt
takes non-zero values also
after the expellee inflow in t = 0. Likewise, we subsume flows between regions L' and (L-L') into Xt
.
63
within Germany (blue line). The relative population of H to L' increased markedly from 110.8%
in 1939 to 137.7% at the end of 1949. It then gradually came down again and almost, but not
completely, reached its pre-inflow value in 1970. Most of the fall in relative population took place
in the early- to mid-1950s. The blue line shows that inner-German migration is responsible for
most of the change in relative population in the 1950s (but not thereafter).

Notes: The population series in Panel (a), which is based on migration only, is calculated by adding to the
actual population figure of the H and L' region on 31 December 1949 (cumulated) net migration between the
two regions. The unemployment rate in Panel (c) is expressed as a percentage of the dependent labor force.
The unemployment rate of region H in 1938 is approximated by the (labor force-weighted) average of the
1938 unemployment rates of Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and the Nordmark. The unemployment rate of region L'
is approximated by the average of the unemployment rates of Hesse and Southwest Germany.
Panel (b) shows GDP per capita of region H relative to region L' between 1950 and 1970.
Relative GDP per capita reached a trough in 1952, when GDP per capita in region H reached
83.3% of the level of region L'. The gap between the two regions then narrowed markedly in
the 1950s, and relative GDP per capita stood at 88.5% in 1960. The 1960s saw no further
64
improvement in region H's relative GDP per capita. If anything, the gap to region L' widened
again. Unfortunately, we do not have a good measure of relative GDP per capita before the war.
We can, however, again look at sales per capita between 1935 and 1955 (we discuss the pros and
cons of using sales per capita as a proxy for production in Appendix A.1). Sales per capita of
region H relative to region L' fell from 86.6% in 1935 to 77.6% in 1950, and then increased to
82.3% in 1955.
Panel (c) gives the unemployment rates of regions H and L' in 1938 and between 1950 and
1963. At 1.6%, unemployment rates of the two regions were identical before the war. Both re-
gions then experienced a drastic increase in unemployment, which, however, was much more
pronounced in H than in L'. In 1950, the unemployment rate was 16.7% in region H but only
6.8% in region L'. Unemployment then gradually decreased during the 1950s and regional un-
employment rates were nearly identical by the beginning of the 1960s.
Overall, comparing the demographic and economic development of regions H and L' yields
empirical facts that are very similar to those obtained by comparing region H and L. Nevertheless,
two differences stand out. First, the population of H continues to fall in the 1960s relative to L'
but not relative to L. The decline is, however, relatively modest compared to the decline in the
1950s and due to factors other than inner-German migration. Second, the catch-up in GDP per
capita of region H is more pronounced when measured relative to region L than relative to L'.
This might partly be due to the fact that the initial gap in GDP per capita between H and L is
larger than between H and L'.
A.3 Calibrating job-filling rates
The job-filling rate equals the ratio of job-finding rate over labor market tightness, i.e., q(t) =
t/t. As data on gross worker flows is not available for the historical time period, we follow
Shimer (2005) and infer the job-finding rate from aggregate data on employment, unemployment
and short-term unemployment. Let ut be the number of workers unemployed at the end of month
t (in contrast to the rest of the paper, t refers to a month rather than to a quarter in this
appendix), and let uN
t
be the number of workers unemployed for less than one month at the
end of the same month. Finally, let t denote the probability of an unemployed worker finding a
job during month t. If we further assume that no unemployed worker exits the labor force, the
65
unemployment rate evolves according to
ut+1 = (1 - ft+1)ut + uN
t+1
. (27)
The job-finding probability t is given by
ft+1 = 1 -
ut+1 - uN
t+1
ut
. (28)
Unfortunately, the German Federal Employment Agency does not provide data on short-term
unemployment for the historical time period. However, it does provide data on total inflows
into unemployment during a month, It. When a worker enters the unemployment pool, she has,
on average, half a month to leave the unemployment pool before she is recorded as short-term
unemployed at the end of the month. The number of short-term unemployed at the end of month
t can then be approximated by (1 - 0.5t)It, and the job-finding probability can be expressed
as:
t+1 =
ut + It+1 - ut+1
ut + 0.5It+1
. (29)
We use monthly West German data from July 1950 to December 1970 to calculate the job-finding
probability for every month. Data is taken from various issues of the German Federal Employ-
ment Agency's Amtliche Nachrichten. Note that from September 1955 onwards, the employment
agency records inflows into the pool of job seekers instead of inflows into unemployment. There-
fore, we use data on job seekers to calculate the job-finding probability for this time period. The
data indicate that the average monthly job-finding probability was 0.50.
Moreover, data from the German employment agency also indicates that between 1950 and
1970, the average monthly vacancy-unemployment rate in West Germany was 2.20. We thus
approximate the quarterly job-filling rate as (3 × 0.50)/2.20  0.68.
