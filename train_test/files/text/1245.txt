Abstract
Background: An examination of where in the income distribution income is most strongly associated
with risk of mortality will provide guidance for identifying the most critical pathways underlying the
connections between income and mortality, and may help to inform public health interventions to reduce
socioeconomic disparities. Prior studies have suggested stronger associations at the lower end of the
income distribution, but these studies did not have detailed categories of income, were unable to exclude
individuals whose declining health may affect their income and did not use methods to determine exact
threshold points of non-linearity. The purpose of this study is to describe the non-linear risks of all-cause
and cause-specific mortality across the income distribution.
Methods: We examined potential non-linear risk of mortality by family income level in a population that
had not retired early, changed jobs, or changed to part-time work due to health reasons, in order to
minimize the effects of illness on income. We used data from the US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (1988­1994), among individuals age 18­64 at baseline, with mortality follow-up to the
year 2001 (ages 25­77 at the end of follow-up, 106 037 person-years of time at risk). Differential risk of
mortality was examined using proportional hazard models with penalized regression splines in order to
allow for non-linear associations between mortality risk and income, controlling for age, race/ethnicity,
marital status, level of educational attainment and occupational category.
Results: We observed significant non-linear risks of all-cause mortality, as well as for certain specific
causes of death at different levels of income. Typically, risk of mortality decreased with increasing income
levels only among persons whose family income was below the median; above this level, there was little
decreasing risk of mortality with higher levels of income. There was also some variation in mortality risk
at different levels of income by cause and gender.
Conclusion: The majority of the income associated mortality risk in individuals between the ages of 18­
77 in the United States is among the population whose family income is below the median (equal to
$20,190 in 1991, 3.2 times the poverty level). Efforts to decrease socioeconomic disparities may have the
greatest impact if focused on this population.

Background
Despite longstanding knowledge of an inverse association
between income and mortality in the United States [1,2]
and calls to reduce socioeconomic gradients in health [3],
few studies have examined whether the higher risk of
mortality at lower incomes is uniform across the income
distribution or whether threshold points exist in this asso-
ciation. Several studies from the UK and Scandinavia sug-
gest that a threshold point does not exist in the
association between social class and mortality [4-6], and
this has been used to inform policy for reducing health
disparities worldwide [7]. A linear risk of mortality across
the income distribution implies that there are etiologic
pathways from income to mortality for all individuals,
regardless of income level. Conversely, studies from the
US and New Zealand have found primarily non-linear
associations between income and mortality [8-10]. If the
association is non-linear and the income-mortality gradi-
ent exists mainly at lower income levels, research to
understand income differences in health should be
among this population. In addition to guiding etiologic
research of income-mortality associations, the shape of
association has implications for efforts to reduce income-
based disparities: either providing evidence in support of
targeting the full population (if a linear association) or
evidence for support of policies focused on the popula-
tion where such associations are found to exist.
Within the US, only two studies have explicitly examined
the shape of the relationship between income and mortal-
ity [9,10] and both found suggestive evidence of non-lin-
ear associations, with a higher level of income more
strongly associated with increased mortality at the lower
end of the income distribution. These studies were lim-
ited, however, by: (1) a lack of access to finely-measured
income data (thus unable to determine if threshold points
exist in the risk of mortality); (2) an inability to exclude
persons whose declining health status may have reduced
their income level [11], and (3) methods that did not
allow for the testing of statistically significant non-linear
associations and threshold points in change in mortality
risk.
The aim of this paper is to describe the shape of the
income and all-cause and cause-specific mortality associ-
ations among US adults age 18 to 64 at baseline (who
were age 25­77 by the end of follow-up). We examined
the association of income and mortality, restricting our
analysis only to those individuals who were free from
health conditions that caused them to change jobs,
change to part time work, or retire early due to health rea-
sons. By using data with a large number of income catego-
ries and by modelling the association without using a pre-
specified functional form or pre-specified inflection
points we are able to more accurately estimate the shape
of the income and cause-specific mortality associations.
We also compare the fit of models with baseline covari-
ates and either a linear income term, a log-income term,
or a smoothed spline income term in order to determine
which income-mortality model provides the best fit to the
data.
Methods
The US Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III), 1988­1994, was designed to be
representative of the non-institutionalized population of
the U.S. when analyzed using weights to account for over-
sampling and non-response [12]. Our analysis used data
from the National Death Index (NDI), for deaths through
December 31, 2001 linked to NHANES III data, for a
length of follow up of up to 13 years. The NDI is a well
documented and validated method of matching deaths in
the United States to population datasets [13,14]. The def-
inition of cause of death has been validated to have a dis-
crepancy rate of approximately 5% [15]. Only NHANES
III participants at least 18 years of age at the time of inter-
view were eligible for follow-up, and we limited our anal-
yses to individuals that were under the age of 65 at
baseline (n = 14,798) (individuals missing at the time of
follow up (0.3%) were excluded). We excluded the fol-
lowing individuals to minimize causation from health to
income: individuals who self-reported that they "changed
permanently to an easier job," "changed temporarily to an
easier job," "cut down to part-time work only," "have to
stop working for a few months," or "retire because of a
disability," for the reason of "a disability or health prob-
lems" (10%) [16]. We also excluded individuals who died
after one year or less of follow up (0.3%), as illness in the
year prior to death may have reduced family income. Indi-
viduals who were missing income (7%), education
(0.05%) or occupation (1%) were also excluded. The sum
of these exclusions resulted in a final analytic sample of
11,733 individuals (106 037 person-years) with 349
deaths (table 1).
We examined all-cause mortality and three cause-specific
categories of adult mortality as defined by the following
ICD-10 classifications: 1) heart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13,
I20-I51), 2) cancer (C00-C97) and 3) injury (both inten-
tional and unintentional) (V01-Y34, Y85-Y86, Y87.0,
Y87.1, Y87.2, Y89.9).
Total combined pre-tax family income for the 12 months
prior to the survey included wages, salaries, income from
self-employment, veteran's benefits, interest dividends,
rental income and public assistance. Family income data
were available in 28 income categories (none, less than
$1000, $1000 to $20,000 in $1000 dollar increments,
$20,000 to $50,000 in $5000 dollar increments, and
greater than $50,000). Income from each half of the sur-

vey (1988­1991, 1991­1994) was adjusted to 1991 dol-
lars using the Urban Consumer Price Index. For all
analyses we used the midpoint of each income category
and calculated the mid-point of the upper category of
income ($66,800) by assuming a Pareto distribution of
family income per standard methodology [17]. Income
(as well as reference points of median income and poverty
line) is made equivalent for economies of scale by divid-
ing family income by the square root of family size. In this
study we conceptualize income as a measure of the level
of earnings of a household at a particular point in time, a
value that has been empirically shown to have a strong
association with lifetime earnings[18]
Additional covariates included: (a) education (0­17 or
more years), (b) race/ethnicity (using the available catego-
ries of white non-Hispanic, Hispanic, black, other), (c)
age (in years), and (d) occupation, referring to the longest
held occupation, divided into 5 categories: (1): white col-
lar and professional (e.g. executive, management, profes-
sional, supervisors); (2): white collar, semi-routine (e.g.
technicians, sales workers, secretaries); (3): blue collar,
high skill (e.g. mechanics, construction trades, military);
(4): blue collar, semi-routine (e.g. personal services, wait-
ers and waitresses, food preparation, farm workers, motor
vehicle operators); and (5): never worked. Detailed
NHANES III occupational categories were used to create
this variable [see Additional file 1]. Labor force participa-
tion was defined as working at a job or business or having

a job or business within the last two weeks, not including
work around the house.
In order to be consistent with prior work on the shape of
the association of income and mortality [6,8,9] we mod-
elled mortality for women and men separately. The three
models that we present include the following covariates:
model 1) income, age, race/ethnicity, marital status,
model 2) income, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, edu-
cation, occupation, model 3) income, age, race/ethnicity,
marital status, education, occupation, labor force partici-
pation. The estimated income coefficient from model 1 is
not conditional on other measures of socioeconomic
position, and thus may not adequately control for con-
founding of the income-mortality association. The esti-
mated income coefficient from model 2 is conditional on
other measures of socioeconomic position (i.e. education
and occupation), and is the primary model for inference
and for which associations are shown in the figures.
Model 3 additionally controls for current labor force par-
ticipation, as this may confound the association of
income and mortality, but may also be on the causal path-
way between income and mortality and thus should not
be included as a control variable [8].
The income and cause-specific mortality associations were
modelled with penalized splines (with a cubic basis) in
proportional hazard survival models in order to allow for
possible non-linear dependence of mortality hazard on
income (as well as for education when included as a cov-
ariate)[19,20]. We use age as the time-scale of the baseline
hazard rather than time-on-study as this allows for less
biased model estimates with respect to age, and allows for
non-linear associations between age and mortality
[21,22]. Penalized splines model the association by fitting
a large number of regression splines joined at evenly
spaced knots, with a penalty on coefficients of adjacent
knots [23]. The starting point for the model fitting proce-
dure is to fit a saturated model of a large number of
splines, and then to penalize the fit based on a smoothing
parameter (theta) to adjust the penalty term to avoid over
fitting the data. Prior work has shown that by using this
method smoothed estimates of survival are insensitive to
the number and location of knots [23]. Theta can vary
between 0 and 1, where 0 is close to an exact fit to the
data, and 1 is a straight line. The initial values of theta
were chosen by generalized cross validation ­ an auto-
mated model fitting procedure where the optimal value of
theta is determined by repeatedly fitting the model on
random subsets of the data and then testing how well the
model predicts the data that was not used to create the
model [20]. Based on subject matter knowledge, we then
increased the thetas to be slightly closer to 1 (a more con-
servative model) to avoid models that overfit the data,
although fit was very similar in both sets of models
(model fit from the theta chosen by generalized cross val-
idation results available from the authors). All models we
present are thus more conservative models for identifying
non-linearity then those selected by generalized cross-val-
idation.
We first present the unadjusted incidence rates of all-cause
mortality by gender and income (table 2). We then
present the Chi-square statistics and associated two-sided
p-values from adjusted spline models in order to allow for
assessment of the degree of difference in spline slopes for
income parameters, values that may be interpreted as tests
of non-linearity (table 3) [20]. We also present likelihood
ratio tests comparing fitted models with a spline term to:
1) models controlling for baseline covariates, 2) models
controlling for baseline covariates and a linear income
term, and 3) models controlling for baseline covariates
and log transformation of income (table 4). A likelihood
ratio test comparing each fitted model to a null model is
used to determine overall model fit. The null hypothesis
for this comparison is no difference in model fit, therefore
p-values of less than 0.05 reject the null hypothesis and
indicate that the fitted model is a better description of the
data. Due to the different degrees of freedom in each of
the models, it is most appropriate to compare p-values

across models to evaluate relative model fit. All analyses
were conducted using R version 2.5.1[24] The propor-
tional hazard model was implemented using the function
coxph(), and the penalized spline fit was implemented
using the pspline() function[25] Plotted standard errors
were calculated by a grouped jackknife estimate imple-
mented using the cluster() function, and all models
employed weighting to account for the complex sampling
design. Survey adjusted population frequencies and histo-
grams were calculated using the survey package [26,27].
This research was approved by the Harvard School of Pub-
lic Health's Committee on Human Subjects.

and cancer mortality for men of occupational category 5).

Results
Population
Table 1 shows the baseline (1988­1994) distribution of
the full sample as compared to our restricted analytic sam-
ple of NHANES III participants without missing data who
did not retire early or change jobs or go to part time work
because of health related reasons. There were no substan-
tial differences in the distribution of population character-
istics between the full population and restricted samples,
although there were slightly fewer individuals in the 45­
64 age category in the restricted sample. Twenty-two per-
cent had incomes below 50% of the median U.S. family
size adjusted income (in this population, equivalent to
$10,090), a level commonly used to define economic
deprivation [28]. There were substantially fewer individu-
als not currently in the labor force in the restricted analytic
sample.
Income and all-cause mortality
Table 2 shows the unadjusted all-cause mortality rates
(and 95% confidence intervals) by category of family
equivalized income. Mortality rates are substantially
higher among women and men in households with less
than $10,000 a year of family income. Among women
there is also an elevated rate of mortality in the $25,000-
$29,999 income category, and among men in the
$30,000-$34,999 category, but these elevated rates are not
consistent across other income categories above $10,000
a year.
Figure 1 shows the smoothed hazard ratios (Y-axis) of all-
cause mortality for women and men by level of equival-
ized family income (X-axis), for the population aged 18­
64 at baseline. Models control for age, race/ethnicity, mar-
ital status, education and occupation, and the population
is restricted to individuals who did not die within one year
of follow-up, retire early due to health reasons, change

For all-cause mortality (Figure 1), among both women
and men risk of mortality decreased with increasing
income until near the median income level; and above
this level, we observed no decreasing mortality hazard
with income. Chi-square tests for the statistical signifi-
cance of the non-linear associations between income and
mortality hazard are given in table 3. The Chi-square test
statistic, degrees of freedom (df) and p-value are shown
for the associations in figure 1 (Model 2) as well as for
models controlling only for age, marital status and race/
ethnicity (Model 1), and for models additionally control-
ling for labor force participation (Model 3). In all models
(except model 1 for heart disease among women) the Chi-
square test for a non-linear association of income with
mortality was significant at the alpha = 0.05 level (Table
3).
Income and cause-specific mortality
For cause-specific mortality (Figure 2), risk of death due to
heart disease among women showed a similar pattern as
was observed for all-cause mortality, where the income-
mortality association was strongest below median
income. For men, the risk of mortality decreased in a gen-
erally linear pattern. For death due to cancer, women and
men exhibited different non-linear risk with income.
Among persons below median family income, risk of
mortality due to cancer declined slightly with higher levels
of income for women and men. Among persons above
median family income, risk was not associated with
income among the men, but increased among women.
Lastly, for death due to injury, risk decreased most
strongly below median income, with some further
decrease in risk above this point among women but not
among men.
Alternative models of income and mortality
We repeated the analyses shown in Figures 1 and 2 both
not controlling for occupational category and years of
education (Model 1) and additionally controlling for
labor force participation (Model 3) and obtained similar
results (Table 3). Among women and men, all-cause mor-
tality remained significantly associated with income in a
non-linear manner for all outcomes in all three models.
We also examined the extent to which specifying a non-
linear functional form of income improved the overall
model fit for prediction of mortality as compared to: 1)
baseline covariates and no income variable; 2) baseline
covariates and a linear income variable; or 3) baseline
covariates and a log transformation of income. We did so
by comparing the likelihood ratios of each model, taking
into account increased degrees of freedom of income and
the non-linear income models (Table 4). A lower p-value
represents a stronger rejection of the null hypothesis of no
difference between a null model with no predictors and
the full models. For all-cause mortality (among women
and men) and injury (among men) the models with non-
linear income are the best fit to the data. For heart disease
(among men and women), cancer (among men) and
injury (among women) a non-linear income model is an
equally good fit to the data as a linear income model
(heart disease), a linear or log income term (cancer among
men), or any of the other models for injury among
women.
Discussion
Among US women and men age 18 to 64 at baseline, with
follow-up of up to 13 years, we found evidence of a gen-
erally stronger associations of income with all-cause mor-
tality at the lower end of the income distribution, i.e.,
under median income. Similar patterns occurred for
deaths due to cancer and injury; by contrast, a more linear
association across the full income range was evident for
death due to heart disease. These results are unlikely to be
substantially driven by contemporaneous effects of illness
on income because of the restrictions of our sample to
individuals with more than one year of follow up who
had not ever changed jobs, changed to part-time work, or
retired early due to health reasons. In fact, our results are
likely a conservative estimate of the association due to the
potential effects of income on illness, given that we
restricted our analysis to a healthy sample that has not left
the labor force due to health reasons.
Our results for all-cause mortality are generally consistent
with the previously reported logarithmic functional form
of association with income [9,10]. However, our results
expand on this observation in three important ways. First,
we find that the shape of association varies by type of
mortality. Second, based on the overall fit of models with
either a log function of income or a non-linear function of
income, the appropriateness of a log function for model-
ling income and mortality holds most closely for only
cancer mortality among men and injury mortality among
women. Third, based on visual inspection of the plotted
income-mortality hazard ratios we identify median

income level as a critical point of inflection for outcomes
where substantial non-linear associations were found.
These results should be considered within the context of
several study limitations. First, the data we used lack spe-
cific income categories above $50,000 a year, which limits
our understanding of the impacts of income for the 8% of
families that had the highest equivalized income. Our
estimates at the upper end of the income distribution are
less precise, as indicated by the widening confidence inter-
vals in the plots, and the point estimates in these regions
should be interpreted cautiously. A second limitation of
this analysis is that income is measured at only one point
in time, thus not capturing household income dynamics
that influence health outcomes [29-31]. This also results
in a potential mismatch between income and social class
related exposures and the relevant time periods for disease
etiology. However, as income level of households are cor-
related across time, a recent measure of income does cap-
ture an important aspect of households' socioeconomic
position [30], and one that is strongly correlated with per-
manent income. A third limitation is that as with any non-
experimental study the associations observed may be due
to residual confounding rather than a causal relationship
between income and mortality. For example, we lack
information on wealth and debt, additional markers of
socioeconomic position that have been demonstrated to
affect health [28,32]. This may result in some residual
confounding by social class that may contribute to bias in
our estimates of the associations between income level
and mortality risk [33].
Based on a qualitative inspection of the smoothed plots of
the income-mortality association, and the overall tests of
model fit, we have shown that a non-linear association
with a stronger association below median income is the
most prevalent pattern of association. There were however
variations in this association by cause and by gender. For
heart disease, in particular among men, there appears to
be less of a threshold at median income. While this may
be due to mortality risk for heart disease more evenly dis-
tributed across the income distribution, an alternative
explanation is that we have limited power to detect the
shape of the association due to a relatively small number
of heart disease events above median income (as confi-
dence intervals indicate). Supporting this later specula-
tion is prior work examining a two slope model of income
and cardiovascular mortality that has shown there is a
stronger association at lower income levels [10].
While significant associations were observed for both men
and women, and the shape of the relation was similar for
all-cause, heart disease and injury mortality, there were
different associations observed among women and men
for cancer above median income ­ no association for
men, and a slightly increasing association among women.
Tests of overall model fit showed that while a linear or
logarithmic model of income was an equally good fit to
the data among men, a non-linear model was a better fit
among women. This difference may be due to the positive
association between socioeconomic position and rates of
breast cancer mortality in women that does not exist as
strongly for any site of cancer in men [34,35]. These differ-
ing results by cause and gender are consistent with the
context-, time-, and cause-contingent nature of social gra-
dients; empirical findings indicate that income-mortality
associations are not fixed, but rather vary across cultures
and centuries [36].
Our results are generally consistent with the two other US
studies that examined the shape of the income-mortality
association [9,10], despite the fact that these studies were
not able to eliminate individuals who had health prob-
lems that may have effected their income. While our
results not adjusting for labor force partipation are similar
to those observed by Blakely et al. in New Zealand, this
study finds that after adjusting for labor force participa-
tion the association of mortality with income is markedly
attenuated, in contrast with our findings [8]. This may be
due to our restricted healthy sample, our non-linear
method of analysis, or due to stronger effects of labor
force participation on mortality in New Zealand as com-
pared to the United States. Our finding of a non-linear
shape of association contrast with findings from Finland,
where Martikainen et al report a linear shape of associa-
tion between income and mortality [6]. While this may be
due to differing access to benefits and social services in the
U.S. and Finland, Blakely et al. note that if an absolute
level of income was used to assess the shape of the associ-
ation, the results of Martikainen et al are consistent with a
flattening of risk at upper income levels[8]
The results presented have implications for understanding
the etiological links between income and mortality. Based
on the observed associations, income disparities in mor-
tality chiefly among lower income populations (below
the median income) appear to be driving the commonly
reported socioeconomic gradients in all-cause, cancer
among men and injury mortality. These findings also
underscore why efforts to address income disparities in
mortality cannot be restricted simply to persons below the
US poverty line but instead should include persons with
income at least up to the median level. The difference in
size of these two populations is large: in 1991, the mid-
point of the income data collection, 13% of families in the
U.S. were below the poverty line (equal to $10,860 for a
three person family) as compared to 50% of families
below the median family income (equal to $35,940), an
absolute difference of 37% of US families, and similar to
what we have in our study population (Table 1). While

anti-poverty policies and programs that include individu-
als up to either 125%, 150% or 185% of poverty level are
common (185% of the poverty level is equivalent to
$20,090 for a family of three), the additional population
between the 185% poverty level and median income,
equivalent to approximately 22% of US families, consti-
tute a large segment of the population that potentially is
not benefiting from efforts to reduce health and economic
disparities. Suggesting this could be done, benefits from
the earned income credit, which specifically address
income disparities, reach beyond 185% of the poverty
level [37].
Conclusion
In the US context, in adults aged 18­64 at baseline, the
non-linear risk of mortality with income arises from the
stronger relationship between income level and mortality
among lower compared to higher income populations.
This evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that policies
to improve the health of individuals among the lower half
of the income distribution will have the most impact on
reducing US income-based disparities in mortality,
although from our data we cannot establish why this asso-
ciation exists. Second, if the associations presented are not
due to residual confounding, measurement error, or unac-
counted for reverse causation, they may also have impli-
cations for the importance of income in contributing to
premature mortality. Future studies determining the path-
ways connecting income and mortality will benefit from a
consideration of where in the income distribution the
burden of disparity exists, and that this association varies
by cause.
