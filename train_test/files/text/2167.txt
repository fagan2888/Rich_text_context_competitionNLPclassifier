Community violence and urban childhood
asthma: a multilevel analysis
M.J. Sternthal*, H-J. Jun#, F. Earls",+ and R.J. Wright#,1
ABSTRACT: We examined the association between community violence exposure and childhood
asthma risk in a multilevel, multimethod, longitudinal study controlling for individual- and
neighbourhood-level confounders and pathway variables.
Analyses included 2,071 children aged 0­9 yrs at enrolment from the Project on Human
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Multilevel logistic regression models estimated the
likelihood of asthma, controlling for individual-level (child's age, sex, race/ethnicity, maternal
asthma, socioeconomic status and family violence in the home) and neighbourhood-level
confounders (concentrated disadvantage, collective efficacy and social disorder), and pathway
variables (maternal smoking, breastfeeding).
In adjusted analyses, medium (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.17­2.19) and high levels (OR 1.56, 95% CI
1.12­2.18) of community violence were associated with increased asthma risk, relative to low
levels. The increased asthma risk remained for African Americans when models included
community violence and all other individual-level covariates, but attenuated to borderline
nonsignificance when further adjusting for collective efficacy.
Community violence is associated with asthma risk when controlling for individual- and
neighborhood-level confounders. Neither community violence, nor the other individual-level
factors, fully accounted for the excess asthma burden among African Americans. These data
suggest that public health interventions outside the biomedical model may be needed to reduce
asthma in disadvantaged populations.
KEYWORDS: Asthma, collective efficacy, community violence, multilevel analyses,
neighbourhood disadvantage, social disorder
In the USA, those living in impoverished
urban neighbourhoods have the highest
asthma rates and associated morbidity rela-
tive to their higher socioeconomic status (SES)
and nonurban counterparts [1]. Such disparities
are not adequately explained by physical envir-
onmental factors [2]. The recognised importance
of the social environment in child health, coupled
with knowledge of the mechanisms linking
psychological stress and asthma [2, 3] indicate
that children may be raised in social contexts
potentially as detrimental to their development
and health as physical toxins [4].
Chronic community violence has been identified
as a prevalent and extreme stressor confronting
many urban poor communities [5, 6]. In one
inner-city cohort in Chicago, IL, USA, 42% of
children aged 7­13 yrs had seen someone shot
and 37% had seen someone stabbed [6].
Moreover, community violence contributes signifi-
cantly to urban childhood morbidity [5]. Witnessing
or being a victim of community violence adversely
affects a child's cognitive, emotional and social
functioning [7, 8]. Research links community
violence exposure to alterations in the physiological
stress response, including increased blood pressure
and heart rate, and disrupted cortisol expression [8,
9]. Such biobehavioural and physiological sequelae
may lead to broader health effects. Accumulating
evidence suggests that community violence may
contribute to the burden of asthma in urban
populations [5]. Increased exposure is associated
with more symptom days [10], higher hospitalisa-
tion rates [11], increased asthma prevalence among
children in communities with both elevated crime/
violence and other environmental hazards (i.e.
ambient air pollutants) [12], and increased risk of
wheezing at 2­3 yrs of age [13].
While evidence suggests that community vio-
lence may contribute to asthma expression, there
are methodological limitations. First, studies
have not accounted for the co-occurrence of other
childhood adversities that may also contribute to

psychological stress and asthma (e.g. interfamilial violence)
[14]. Secondly, none of the existing studies consider neigh-
bourhood structural measures. This is problematic because
community violence clusters in areas characterised by other
community-level social stressors that also tax individuals
living in these neighbourhoods. These include constructs of
neighbourhood disadvantage, social disorder and low collec-
tive efficacy [5, 15]. For example, the real or perceived threat of
crime, and the broader construct of social disorder, fosters a
distrust of others, disrupted collective efficacy and social
isolation [15], which, in turn have been linked to asthma
outcomes in low-income families [16]. Moreover, those
experiencing greater community violence may also be exposed
to physical toxins linked to asthma expression (air pollution
and indoor allergens) [17]. Thirdly, studies to date have been
cross-sectional or retrospective, preventing demonstration of a
temporal relationship between community violence exposure
and asthma development.
We address some of these limitations by examining whether
higher level exposure to community violence is associated with
an increased risk of asthma in a prospective study of urban
children, after controlling for individual-level sociodemo-
graphics, behaviour (smoking or breastfeeding), family vio-
lence and neighbourhood-level measures of disadvantage,
social disorder and collective efficacy.
METHODS
Study design and analytic sample
Data are from the Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a multilevel, multimethod, long-
itudinal study of contextual factors and individual develop-
ment [18]. Figure 1 illustrates the data collection schema and
current analytic sample. Briefly, 343 Chicago neighbourhood
clusters (NCs) were identified using 1990 US Census data. In
1995, an interview-administered community survey (CS) was
conducted with a representative sample of adults within each
of the NCs (n58,782) to derive neighbourhood-level constructs
(i.e. social disorder and collective efficacy detailed below)
independent of the sample from which individual-level data
were ascertained.
For the longitudinal study, a stratified probability sample of 80
neighbourhoods was selected from the 343 NCs. Conceived
using an accelerated cohort design, English- and Spanish-
speaking households were screened for eligible children
within 6 months of seven target cohort ages (0 (in utero to
age 6 months), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 yrs). Within each
household, all eligible children were invited to participate,
along with the primary caregiver for those ,18 yrs of age.
Participants were enrolled in 1995 and followed in three waves
of data collection: wave 1 (1994­1997), wave 2 (1997­1999) and
wave 3 (2000­2001). The institutional review board of the

secondary analyses using the public database.
Community violence exposure
At wave 2, primary caregivers completed the My Exposure to
Violence (ETV) survey, a structured, interviewer-administered
measure ascertaining the child's lifetime exposure to violent
events in their neighbourhood [19, 20]. Internal consistency,
test­retest reliability and validity have been established,
including the Spanish translation [21]. For endorsed items,
follow-up questions inquire about factors known to influence
the impact of violence, including familiarity with the perpe-
trator or victim, events occurring more than once and whether
events occurred outside the home. For the main exposure, we
considered only events witnessed and/or experienced outside
the home (i.e. neighbourhood violence) in the child's lifetime
prior to asthma diagnosis.
Rasch modelling was used to summarise the multi-item
responses (table 1) into a continuous ETV composite variable
[7]. Models were fitted using logistic, nonlinear, mixed models
(NLMIXED) in SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)
specifying a binary distribution and a random effect, defined
to have mean of 0 and a variance estimated by the model-
fitting process. Higher scores indicate greater exposure. ETV
was examined as a continuous indicator and divided into
tertiles to test for an exposure­response relationship.
Asthma outcome
In wave 3, standardised questions adapted from the American
Thoracic Society Division of Lung Diseases (ATS-DLD-78)
questionnaire [22] were administered to the primary caregivers
of children from the age cohorts who were 0­9 yrs of age at
enrolment. The analytic sample included everyone in these age
groups who completed the survey (n52,228) (response rate
75.8%), excluding 152 children missing information on com-
munity violence exposure and five missing information on
race/ethnicity, to give a total of n52,071. The primary outcome
was defined as having ever been diagnosed with asthma or
having ever taken prescription asthma medicine.
We considered alternative definitions in sensitivity analyses.
Because having a current diagnosis of wheeze is associated
with more objective measures, including airway responsive-
ness [23], we alternatively examined current asthma, which
was defined as having both a diagnosis and reporting
symptoms or medication use indicative of asthma (i.e.
wheezing or using prescription medication for wheezing) in
the past year. We also considered the potential for uncon-
firmed possible asthma, defined as never having been
diagnosed with asthma but reporting symptoms (ever wheez-
ing) or prescription medication use for wheezing illnesses. The
latter definition was considered to address concerns about
underdiagnosis of asthma potentially attributable to racial or
ethnic disparities in access to healthcare [24] or cultural
differences in acceptability of a diagnosis of asthma [25].
Covariates
Variables previously related to community violence exposure
and childhood asthma were examined as summarised in
figure 2 [5, 11, 14, 26, 27].
Individual-level confounders
Sociodemographics
Variables ascertained in wave 1 included maternal education,
child's race/ethnicity and sex. Child's age at wave 3 was also
used. Equivalised income was calculated by dividing house-
hold income by the square root of the number of household
members [28].
Maternal asthma
Maternal asthma, ascertained at wave 3, was defined as having
ever been diagnosed with asthma by a physician asthma [22].
Family violence in the home
Maternal report of the child's exposure to family violence was
obtained in wave 2 using the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) Form R
assessing the extent to which she and her partner psychologi-
cally and physically attacked one another in the past year [29].
Reliability and validity data are available, including the Spanish
translation [30]. Items assessed psychological aggression (e.g.
insulting/swearing and threatening violence) and physical
violence (e.g. pushing or slapping; kicking, hitting, or beating;
or using a weapon). Participants rated whether items occurred
never, once, twice, 3­5, 6­10, 11­20, or more than 20 times as
both victim and perpetrator. Summed scores were included as a
three-level categorical indicator representing none (score of 0),

low (less than the median value, range 1­25) and high (above the
median value, range 26­488).
Neighbourhood-level confounders
Neighbourhood disadvantage
Neighbourhood disadvantage, characterised by community-
level stressors beyond violence (e.g. concentrated poverty,
unemployment and segregation) may also be a surrogate
marker of increased exposure to other environmental expo-
sures not directly assessed in this study (e.g. ambient
pollutants and indoor allergens) [17]. A disadvantage index
was derived for each NC using aggregated data from the 1990
US Census (independent of the PHDCN-CS) based on an
average z-score for: 1) percentage living below poverty, 2)
percentage unemployed, 3) percentage on public assistance, 4)
percentage female-headed households, 5) percentage youth,
and 6) percentage African Americans [31].
Social disorder
Research links social disorder to crime and poor health [32].
Social disorder itself, or increased crime in this context (i.e. crime
that subjects are aware of but have not personally experienced)
may independently affect health, including asthma [11]. The
three-item scale asked how much of a neighbourhood problem
(ranging from 0 (``no problem'') to 2 (``serious problem'')) are:
drinking in public, selling or using drugs, and teenagers or
adults loitering and causing trouble. Items were summed, with
higher scores indicating greater disorder.
Collective efficacy
Collective efficacy measures the level of trust among residents
and their perceived willingness to engage in collective action
[18]. Conversely, increased disorder fosters mistrust, isolation
and a perception of community indifference to individuals in
need [15]. Neighbourhoods with high collective efficacy often
report less crime [31] and better health [33]. Collective efficacy
was derived using a composite measure based on the PHDCN-
CS social cohesion and informal social control scales [18]. The
social control measure asked whether neighbours would take
action (from 1 ``strongly agree'' to 4 ``strongly disagree'') if:
children were skipping school or loitering, spray-painting
graffiti on a building, or showing disrespect to an adult; or if a
fight broke out in front of their house, or the fire station closest
to home was threatened by budget cuts. Social cohesion
assessed respondents' level of agreement (from 1 ``strongly
agree'' to 4 ``strongly disagree'') that people in their neighbor-
hood generally don't get along, do not share the same values,
can be trusted, are willing to help their neighbours, or are
close-knit (last three items reverse coded). Items were summed
with higher scores indicating greater collective efficacy.
Pathway variables
Maternal health behaviours
Maternal smoking and breastfeeding behaviours were
obtained in wave 3. These behaviours may be disrupted
through violence exposure [26, 27] and are associated with
childhood asthma/wheeze risk.

Statistical analyses
Differences in means or proportions between asthmatics and
nonasthmatics were evaluated using Chi-squared or unpaired
t-tests, as appropriate. The correlation between continuous
variables was examined, given the concern for collinearity.
These multilevel data included individuals at level 1 nested
within 80 NCs at level 2. To account for potential neighbour-
hood variation in asthma, we used multilevel logistic regres-
sion models [34], estimated using MLwiN, version 2.10
(University of Bristol, Bristol, UK), building models in a
stepwise fashion [35].
As represented in figure 2, we examined potential pathways
linking community violence, as well as confounders of these
associations. First, we modelled the log odds of asthma as a
function of neighbourhood violence, adjusting for the child's
age, sex, race/ethnicity and maternal asthma, conditional on
the random effect for neighbourhoods. We then introduced
individual-level confounders: socioeconomic covariates (care-
giver's education and equivalised household income) (model
2); family violence exposure in the home (model 3); mother's
smoking status and breastfeeding history (model 4). The final
model (model 5) adjusted for neighbourhood-level confound-
ing (concentrated disadvantage, collective efficacy, and social
disorder at level 2).
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analyses considered alternative asthma indicators
(current asthma and unconfirmed possible asthma).
RESULTS
Sample characteristics are summarised in table 2. Overall, 19%
of the children had diagnosed asthma. A greater proportion of
those exposed to medium (35.2%) or high (43%) community
violence had asthma, compared with those with low ETV
(21.8%) (p,0.01 for both). More African Americans, relative to
Whites or Mexicans, had asthma (25.8 versus 17.3% (p,0.004)
and 25.8 versus 12.1% (p,0.001), respectively). Fewer Mexicans
had asthma than Whites (12.1 versus 17.3%; p,0.03)) or non-
Mexican Hispanics (12.1 versus 21.5%; p,0.001)). More males
(22.6%) than females (15.4%) had asthma (p,0.001). Children
of mothers with asthma were more likely to have asthma
compared to those without a maternal history (43.1 versus
15.1%; p,0.0001)). Asthma was also higher among children
exposed to high (21%; p,0.01) or low (19%; p,0.03) family
violence, compared with no family violence (13.2%). Asthma
was increased in areas of high concentrated disadvantage
(23.2%) compared to medium (16.4%; p,0.01) or low (17.3%;
p,0.01).
Experiencing violence in the neighbourhood was significantly
related to family violence in the home, the child's age,
equivalised income and the neighbourhood constructs,
although the correlations were weak, minimising concerns
for collinearity (table 3). Equivalised income, neighbourhood
disadvantage, social disorder and collective efficacy were more
moderately correlated. However, adding these covariates to
the models in various combinations did not significantly
influence the b estimates or standard errors, again lessening
concern for collinearity (data not shown) [36].
In hierarchical models, community violence, when measured
continuously, was significantly associated with elevated
asthma risk. Unadjusted analyses revealed an almost 50%
increased risk in asthma for every unit increase in the ETV
score (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.30­1.68). The effects persisted after
adjusting for all individual- and neighbourhood-level covari-
ates (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09­1.49). Results were robust to
alternative asthma definitions (current asthma and uncon-
firmed possible asthma) (data not shown).
The odds ratio for asthma by exposure to community violence
(measured in tertiles) is presented in table 4. Model 1 is
adjusted for maternal asthma, child race and sex. In this model,
exposure to medium (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14­2.11) and high (OR
1.53, 95% CI 1.11­2.10) levels of community violence was
associated with a similarly elevated risk of asthma compared
to those with low exposure. The effects for community violence
were essentially unchanged after further adjusting for all other
individual- and neighbourhood-level confounders (model 5).
In the fully adjusted model 5, male sex and maternal asthma
were independently associated with increased asthma risk.
Neighbourhood-level constructs were not significantly related
to asthma.
Notably, African American race remained independently
associated with increased asthma risk in models including
community violence and all other individual-level covariates
(model 4). Further adjusting for all three neighbourhood
constructs simultaneously attenuated this effect (model 5). In
order to ascertain which construct was responsible for the
attenuation we added variables one at a time. Further
adjustment for concentrated disadvantage and social disorder
added to Model 4 (one at a time) did not significantly change
the observed relationship with African American race (OR
1.54, 95% CI 1.02­2.3, and OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.02­2.6,
respectively). Upon further adjusting model 4 for collective
efficacy, the elevated risk in African Americans remained,
albeit at borderline significance (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.99­2.24)
similar to the effect estimate in model 5 (including all three
neighbourhood constructs). This suggested that reduced levels
of collective efficacy, in part, explains the persistent increased
risk for asthma seen in these African American children.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal, multilevel
study to demonstrate a significant association between com-
munity violence exposure and increased risk for asthma
development in urban children. This association was robust
to controlling for important individual-level factors (race/
ethnicity, SES, maternal health behaviours and family vio-
lence), and neighbourhood-level confounders (concentrated
disadvantage, social disorder and collective efficacy), and was
consistent across alternative outcomes (e.g. current asthma or
undiagnosed possible asthma).
Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence linking
community violence to asthma expression [10, 11, 13]. A
number of mechanisms underlying this association have been
proposed. Violence exposure has been conceptualised as a
psychological and environmental stress that taxes both
individuals and communities [5]. At the individual level,
increased stress may lead to the dysregulation of the

obviously share the violent environment, and thus violence
may operate through influencing behaviours and functioning
in the mother that then impact asthma expression in the child.
For example, violence exposure may result in increased
smoking in mothers, thus increasing the child's exposure
[26]. Similarly, low-income females living with violence may
be less likely to breastfeed [27], which may enhance asthma
risk. However, adjusting for maternal smoking and breastfeed-
ing behaviours did not reduce the observed effect. Community
violence exposure may also result in poor psychological
functioning in mothers (e.g. anxiety and depression) [37] that
may, in turn, disrupt parenting behaviours and lead to greater
stress for the child and altered emotional development [38].
Other studies show that children exposed to violence tend to
express higher levels of negative emotion (e.g. anxiety and
depression). More harmful stress reactivity and negative
emotion, in turn, have been linked to asthma [38].
Additionally, concern about safety may cause parents to
restrict their children's outdoor activity and close windows,
potentially increasing exposure to indoor pollutants. Children
kept indoors are also more likely to be sedentary; this, in turn,
may be linked to obesity, another risk factor for asthma [5].
Finally, violence-induced stress may potentiate asthma-indu-
cing effects of other environmental pollutants (e.g. air pollu-
tion) [3, 12]. Future work should examine these potential
pathways more directly.
In models including community violence, concentrated dis-
advantage and social disorder, as well as individual-level
covariates, an increased risk of asthma in African American
children remained. Notably, when accounting for collective
efficacy at the neighbourhood level, the elevated risk in
African Americans was no longer significant. This finding is
corroborated by a Chicago study showing lower prevalence of
a composite of respiratory problems (e.g. asthma, emphysema
and other breathing problems) in association with increased
collective efficacy in adults [39]. As pointed out by CAGNEY and
BROWNING [39], mechanisms may include: 1) social control of
adverse health behaviours (e.g. smoking); 2) access to high-
quality healthcare promoting advantageous health practices
(e.g. breastfeeding); 3) empowerment to act collectively to
address adverse environmental factors (e.g. polluting traffic
sources, housing conditions); and 4) less social isolation
[40, 41]. These pathways should be examined empirically in
future work.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of the study include the use of longitudinal data, a
large urban sample, application of item response theory to
summarise community violence exposure, control for other
forms of violence (i.e. family violence) as well as other
important confounders, and the employment of multilevel
analyses to, at least in part, control for unmeasured neighbour-
hood factors. Moreover, findings were robust to alternative
specifications of the asthma/wheeze outcome. Results should
also be interpreted in light of study limitations. We cannot rule
out some unmeasured confounding factor that is correlated
both with community violence and with asthma risk. Exposure
to community violence is just one type of stressor experienced
by children, particularly those living in lower-income urban
environments. While we adjust for other forms of violence (i.e.
family violence in the home), we did not have information on
other stressors (e.g. other negative life events, racism and
housing stress) in this dataset. Violence exposure was
ascertained through questionnaires only; there were no
available biomarkers of potential stress pathways operating
between community violence and asthma (e.g. cortisol disrup-
tion) in the PHDCN sample. Those experiencing higher levels
of community violence may also be exposed to poorer quality
housing and greater traffic, or other polluting sources.
Although we considered neighborhood disadvantage to partly
account for this, the study did not include questions on
household characteristics (e.g. allergens and housing quality)
or more direct measures of the physical toxins that may also
disproportionately burden residents in more disadvantaged
communities [17]. We do have an ongoing birth cohort study
examining risks for childhood asthma in Boston that is directly
measuring indoor allergens and indoor/outdoor air pollution,
violence exposure measures and other relevant stressors, as
well as biomarkers, that will be able to address these
limitations in the future [42]. Finally, the analysis was limited
to Chicago and may not be generalisable beyond this region.

Our findings underscore the potential role of community
violence in explaining urban asthma risk in the USA. From a
policy perspective, our findings suggest that public health
interventions outside of the biomedical model (e.g. neighbour-
hood safety programmes) may be advantageous in reducing
the asthma burden in disadvantaged populations. Research to
more fully elucidate the excess asthma burden among African
American children, and the potential role of collective efficacy
in reducing that burden, is also warranted. These analyses
begin to address the recognised need to consider a shared
conceptual framework considering social, physical and beha-
vioural factors, integrating multilevel methods to elucidate the
complexities of asthma disparities [42, 43].
