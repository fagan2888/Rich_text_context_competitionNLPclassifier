Abstract: Pregnant methamphetamine users who leave substance use treatment against
professional advice may be at risk of poorer health outcomes. To examine the hypothesis that
methamphetamine use during pregnancy may be associated with leaving substance use treat-
ment against professional advice, the 2006Treatment Episode Data Set was analyzed.A logistic
regression adjusting for age, race, service setting, prior substance abuse treatment, criminal
justice referral, and education was conducted. Inclusion criteria were met by 18,688 pregnant
admissions; 26.4% identified methamphetamines as their primary substance of use. Frequency
of use was identified as an effect modifier, therefore results were stratified by less than weekly
use and weekly or more use. Methamphetamine use was significantly associated with leaving
treatment against professional advice regardless of usage level. However, the odds of leaving
treatment were greater among women using methamphetamine less than weekly. Further inves-
tigation into this association may be warranted due to the complications that may result from
methamphetamine use during pregnancy.
Keywords: pregnancy, methamphetamines, treatment, attrition
Introduction
Methamphetamine use is a growing problem among pregnant women in the United
States. Whereas it accounted for only 8% of all pregnant admissions to substance
abuse treatment in 1994, since 2003 it has surpassed cocaine as the number one sub-
stance compelling treatment and now accounts for 24% of all admissions.1 Rates of
methamphetamine treatment admissions are greater in pregnant women than among
both nonpregnant women (12.5%) and men (7%).2 Similarly, hospitalizations of
pregnant women with a diagnosis of methamphetamine abuse doubled from 1998 to
2004 while hospitalizations of pregnant women with a diagnosis of cocaine abuse
declined 44%.3
Methamphetamine usage is disproportionately distributed between men and women
compared to other drugs, possibly because of its effects as a weight loss agent.4­6
Although men account for a greater proportion of the users of most illicit substances,
women account for a greater percentage of methamphetamine users.4 The dispar-
ity is even more pronounced among adolescents4 which is especially concerning as
methamphetamine use has been associated with risky sexual activity and pregnancy
in adolescents.4,7
One of the difficulties in elucidating methamphetamine's effects on the develop-
ing fetus is that drug-using pregnant women may consume more than one substance,
including tobacco and alcohol. Current research has demonstrated associations

between methamphetamine and preterm birth, low gestational
weight, smaller head circumference, and intrauterine growth
restriction.8­10 Pregnant women admitted to the hospital
with a diagnosis of methamphetamine use are more likely
to experience hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, and
placenta previa when compared to pregnant cocaine users.8,11
The evidence that drug use during pregnancy has adverse
effects on the mother and the developing baby and results in
increased healthcare costs for both is well documented.12­16
Effects of neonatal drug exposure have also been shown to
continue into childhood and early adolescence.14,16
Prior research indicates that substance abuse treatment
during pregnancy is associated with increased abstinence
and improved social functioning in the mother, as well as
improved neonatal outcomes such as reduced incidence
of preterm births and higher birth weight.17­19 Despite this,
pregnant women may be at higher risk of not completing
treatment.17,20­22 Given the increasing prevalence of meth-
amphetamine as a primary drug of abuse in pregnancy, it
is imperative that treatment outcomes in this population be
examined. This study was undertaken to examine whether
pregnant women admitted into treatment for methamphet-
amine use were more likely to leave against professional
advice compared with those admitted for other substances.
As a corollary, it was examined whether there were particular
demographic or treatment-specific characteristics among
methamphetamine admissions that were associated with
leaving treatment prematurely.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted using the Treatment
Episode Data Set-Discharges (TEDS-D), an administra-
tive data system that contains data on all substance abuse
admissions to treatment facilities receiving federal funding
in the United States. These data are collected by states to
monitor their individual substance abuse treatment pro-
grams and submitted to SubstanceAbuse and Mental Health
ServicesAdministration. In 2006, the admissions data were
linked to discharge data and made publically available
for the first time. The unit of analysis in TEDS-D is the
admission episode and not the individual client. TEDS-D
contains client-level information on demographics (age,
race, housing, and socioeconomic status), substance abuse
behavior (type of substance, frequency, and mode of use),
as well as treatment characteristics (referral source, days
waiting for treatment, prior treatment, and service setting)
and discharge information (length of stay and reason for
discharge).The dataset in this study was limited to pregnant
admissions only.
Primary variables of interest
The primary exposure of this study was methamphetamine
use, defined by methamphetamine or amphetamine being the
primarydrugcompellingtreatmentadmission.Amphetamines
were not separated from methamphetamines as states varied
in their subclassification of these substances. Some states did
not separate methamphetamines from amphetamines in their
reporting. However, for the states that made this distinction
inTEDS 2007, methamphetamines constituted about 95% of
all stimulant admissions.23 Methamphetamine use was con-
trasted with other primary substances compelling treatment
which included other illicit substances and alcohol. Nicotine
use is not included in TEDS-D.
The primary outcome of this study was clients that left
substance abuse treatment against professional advice.
TEDS-D includes reasons for treatment discharge. 
Leaving
against professional advice is defined as "the client chose
not to complete the treatment program." It includes those
who have not received treatment for some time and are
discharged for administrative reasons. Leaving against
professional advice was contrasted with any other reason
for ending treatment episode, including completion or
incarceration.
Covariates
Additional variables included in the analysis were either

demographic or treatment specific. A dichotomous 
variable
was created that indicated polysubstance use prior to

admission. Prior treatment, injection drug use, and marital
status were all coded as dichotomous variables, as was

education, which was collapsed into some high school or
less versus completed high school or greater. Criminal justice
referral was also coded as a dichotomous variable with those

identified as having been referred by any police official, judge,
prosecutor, probation officer, or other person affiliated with
the federal, state or county judicial systems. Race and age
were categorized into subgroups for analysis as was service
setting. Service setting is defined in TEDS-D as follows:
ambulatory (consisting of outpatient intensive or nonintensive
treatment services), residential (nonacute inpatient short-
or long-term treatment), and detoxification (an acute 24 hour/
day service to provide a safe withdrawal from substances).
Finally, frequency of substance use was described as either
less than weekly use or weekly or more use.
Statistical analysis
Demographic and treatment specific variables were analyzed
using univariate and bivariate analysis. Chi-square tests were
used to identify association between covariates and primary

between methamphetamine use and leaving against profes-
sionaladvicewasdescribedusinganunadjustedoddsratiowith
a 95% confidence interval (CI). Interaction and confounding
wereassessedusingtheBreslow­DayteststatisticandMantel­
Haenszel odds ratio (OR).A Breslow­Day P value of less than
0.01wasconsideredtoprovideevidenceforeffectmodification.
Confounders were identified by comparing Mantel­Haenszel
OR to the unadjusted OR; a difference of 10% or more was
considered evidence of confounding.A P value of less than or
equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Based on the results of the multivariable analysis, logistic
regression models were built including relevant variables
of interest. The association between methamphetamine use
and leaving against professional advice was described using
stratified ORs from the final logistic regression model with
95% CI. All data analysis was completed using SAS (v 9.2;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
In 2006, 18,762 pregnant women were discharged from
treatment inTEDS-D, 74 (0.4%) of whom were missing data
on methamphetamine use. The remaining 18,688 formed
the sample for this study. Demographic characteristics of
pregnant women stratified by methamphetamine use are
presented in Table 1. Approximately 26% of the sample

identified methamphetamines as their primary substance
of use. Other substances compelling treatment admission
included alcohol (n = 2836, 15%), cocaine (n = 3656, 20%),
marijuana (n = 3397, 18%), and heroin (n = 2585, 14%).
Overall, the majority of the sample was young and
white, unemployed, but not homeless. Approximately 50%
had graduated from high school. Compared with other sub-
stance admissions, methamphetamine admissions tended to
be slightly younger. They also tended to be white (64% vs
53%) or of Latino descent (24% vs 12%). Only a very small
proportion (3% vs 28%) identified themselves as African
American (Table 1).
Overall, 5335 admissions (29%) were classified as having
left treatment against professional advice (Table 2), the second
most common reason for discharge.The most common reason
for discharge was treatment completion (n = 6842, 37%).
Other reasons included transfer to another facility (n = 3203,
18%) and treatment terminated by the facility generally
because of client noncompliance (n = 1282, 7%).
Thirty-onepercentofthesamplewasreferredbythecriminal
justice system and the majority (67%) entered an ambulatory
treatment setting. Slightly more admissions reported less than
weekly frequency of substance use (54%). When stratified by
methamphetamineuse,itwasfoundthataslightlyhigherpropor-
tion of methamphetamine admissions left against professional
advice compared to other substance admissions (32% vs 28%).

Additionally,amuchhigherproportionwasreferredtotreatment
through the criminal justice system (40% vs 28%). Another
notable finding was that methamphetamine admissions tended
to report less than weekly drug use more often compared to all
other substance admissions (67% vs 50%) (Table 2).
Results of the multivariable analysis are presented in
Table 3. Frequency of use was identified as an effect 
modifier;
therefore results were stratified by less than weekly and
weekly or greater use. Total N with complete, nonmissing
values for all variables in the multivariable analysis was
15,421, including 8313 who used methamphetamines less
than weekly and 7108 who used at least weekly.After adjust-
ing for age, race, service setting, prior substance abuse treat-
ment, criminal justice referral, and education, it was found
that pregnant methamphetamine admissions had higher odds
of leaving treatment against professional advice compared
with reported users of all other substances. This difference
was more pronounced among less than weekly users.Among
less than weekly substance users, methamphetamine use was
associated with 1.57 times the odds of leaving against profes-
sional advice (95% CI: 1.42­1.75). Among more frequent
users, methamphetamine admissions were 1.19 times more
likely to leave treatment against professional advice com-
pared to users of other substances (95% CI: 1.04­1.36).
Among admissions with less than weekly use, it was
found that criminal justice referral (OR: 0.70, 95% CI:
0.63­0.77) and a high school education (OR: 0.77, 95%
CI: 0.70­0.85) were both protective against leaving against
professional advice. Race also appeared to be a significant
predictor of leaving treatment against professional advice.
AfricanAmericans were 1.42 times (95% CI: 1.23­1.65) and
Latinos 1.29 times (95% CI: 1.13­1.46) more likely to leave
treatment compared with whites.
Results were similar in more frequent methamphetamine
admissions, however, only a criminal justice referral had a
significant protective effect (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.54­0.71)
and only Latinos were statistically more likely to leave
treatment compared to whites. In this group, a high school
education was a slightly protective factor (OR: 0.91, 95% CI:
0.82­1.01). In both usage frequencies, those in residential
and in detoxification treatment were statistically less likely
to leave treatment against professional advice compared to
admissions in ambulatory settings.
Discussion
Methamphetamine use during pregnancy impacts substance
abuse treatment outcomes. Pregnant methamphetamine
users have increased odds of leaving treatment against

Treatment attrition among pregnant methamphetamine users
professional advice when compared to pregnant users of
other drugs, and frequency of use is an effect modifier of
this relationship. Among pregnant admissions that report
less than weekly frequency of use, methamphetamine users
are 57% more likely to leave treatment against profes-
sional advice. Other covariates associated with leaving
treatment against professional advice were also identified,
in particular, a criminal justice system referral and a high
school education or greater resulted in decreased odds of
leaving treatment.
The interpretation of frequency of substance use as an
effect modifier is difficult. There have been few studies
reporting on the frequency of methamphetamine use among
pregnant women. Della Grotta et al24 observed that among
pregnant methamphetamine users, frequency of use declined
over the course of pregnancy from an average of 3.1 days/
week in the first trimester to an average of 1.5 days/week
in the last trimester. If frequency of use decreases over the
course of pregnancy, then those users in the less than weekly
group may have been further along in their pregnancies and
may have left treatment to deliver. Unfortunately, gestational
age cannot be assessed from TEDS-D. Alternatively, less
frequent users may not perceive themselves as having a sub-
stance abuse problem that is severe enough to require treat-
ment and therefore may be less committed to remaining.
Findings regarding high school education and criminal
justice referral are consistent with previous studies on
substance treatment in pregnant women and mixed gender
populations. These studies identified high school education
and a criminal justice referral as predictors of treatment
completion.17,18,25,26 Pregnant women who are referred to
treatment by the criminal justice system rather than self-
referred can risk loss of custody of their children if they don't
complete treatment, which may explain the strong negative
association of this covariate with leaving treatment against
professional advice.A high school education could be a proxy
for socioeconomic level which, along with employment,
may engender greater access to child care, transportation,
or a support network. Similarly, the finding that prior drug
treatment is associated with treatment attrition is consistent
with a previous study.17
Priorresearchinpregnantwomenontheroleofraceinpre-
dicting treatment completion has been inconclusive.17,18,21,27,28
This current study adds evidence in favor of a role for race
and suggests that race may be related to both substance of
abuse and frequency of use.
Administrative data is subject to certain limitations.
TEDS-D only includes institutions receiving public funding;
therefore some treatment facilities are not included. However,
TEDS has been estimated to capture 87% of all treatment
admissions in the United States.29 Another limitation of
TEDS-D is that the unit of data collection is treatment epi-
sode (admission coupled with discharge), not the individual
client. Detoxification treatment usually results in the transi-
tion to residential or ambulatory treatment. Therefore, it is
likely that a particular client could be entered into the data
set more than once, which challenges the assumed indepen-
dence of the samples. Because TEDS-D is deidentified, it is
not possible to run an analysis for correlated data based on
repeated admissions. If correlation was properly accounted
for, then variance would likely increase and results would
be biased away from the null.
Many previous studies of pregnant substance users were
conducted in inpatient facilities with small populations,
limiting statistical power.17,18,21,30 Therefore, strengths of
this study include a large national sample that provided the
statistical power needed to examine and identify multiple
covariates in the regression model, even when stratified by
frequency of use. This research adds depth to the literature
on pregnant amphetamine users, a subgroup that has not

been well studied and is of increasing importance. This is
the first study to examine treatment outcomes in pregnant
methamphetamine users and the first to stratify pregnant
drug users by frequency of use.
Conclusion
Pregnant methamphetamine admissions are more likely to
leave treatment against professional advice, and this rela-
tionship is impacted by frequency of use. Not only does
methamphetamine use currently account for the greatest
number of pregnant admissions to substance abuse treat-
ment, but recent reports indicate that methamphetamine
production is increasing in the United States.31 It is clear
that methamphetamine use during pregnancy will con-
tinue to impact maternal and neonatal health, as well as
substance abuse treatment outcomes, for years to come.
More studies are needed to further examine the frequency
of use patterns among pregnant methamphetamine users
and how they, and other characteristics, impact treatment
outcomes in this population.
