Abstract
Despite the diversity of consumption and class practices of the new urban middle
classes within and between societies, they share some qualities. Focusing on the
lifestyles and mentalities of regulars of specialty coffee bars in Tehran, Glasgow and
Amsterdam, this study explores common characteristics of this group. Our ethnog-
raphy suggests that through their everyday consumption practices, coffee people share a
set of ethical dispositions and cultural practices among which this article focuses on the
metropolitan body, cosmopolitanism and environmentalism.

Introduction
While cities continue to be places for some forms of manufacturing and produc-
tion, they are increasingly built around their utility as places for service and
consumption. This transformation coincides with the growth of the new urban
middle classes and the concomitant emergence of new forms of public urban
culture. The proliferation of cities as theatres of the spectacle also allows for the
development of polymorphous public culture organised around the consumption of
a range of goods and services such as yoga, artisanal beer, olive oil, tea, ice cream,
bread and coffee.
There is a growing body of literature connecting the rise of the new urban middle
classes to the development of the cognitive­cultural economy and gentrification, on the
one hand, and the proliferation of new consumption practices and identities, on the
other hand (Scott, 2012; Zukin, 2010). A growing number of case studies, additionally,
highlight particular aspects of these processes in different cities such as Amsterdam
(Gelmers and Rath, 2015), Glasgow (Shaker Ardekani and Rath, in press), Tehran

(Shaker Ardekani, 2016b), Hong Kong (Kharas and Gertz, 2010) and Cape Town
(McEwan et al., 2015). Although the literature provides valuable insights into
local contexts and idiosyncrasies of the new urban middle classes, little compara-
tive work has been done so far. Despite the fact that they live in sometimes totally
different cities with different contextual opportunities, we argue that the new
urban middle classes have particular qualities and characteristics in common,
some of which expressed through consumption practices. Comparative studies
between different societies are of importance for understanding what the potential
convergences are and what may be contributing to the convergence among the
new urban middle classes.
We decided to ethnographically examine some of the shared characteristics of
the new urban middle classes in diverse urban environments by focusing on a
particular consumption space: specialty coffee bars. As demonstrated by Hyra
(2017), Rath and Gelmers (2014, 2016) and Zukin et al. (2015), specialty coffee
is a beverage rich in identity value and popular among the new urban middle
classes. Focusing on specialty coffee bars opens up an interesting window to
engage with this group, closely observe their styles of consumption, decipher
their polysemic rituals of consumption and to eventually identify their common
traits. Moreover, the cosmopolitan nature of coffee as a global commodity as well
as the ubiquity of specialty coffee bars in urban settings in different parts of the
world demonstrates that these social spaces of lifestyle are highly relevant sites to
study the class practices of the new urban middle classes in a cross-national
investigation.
We have selected sites in three cities: Tehran, Glasgow and Amsterdam. Situated
in both the Global South and North, these cities vary highly in terms of levels of
engagement with globalisation, class relations and social, cultural and political
positioning of coffee bars. Our ethnographic sites provide us with an opportunity
to explore any common grounds among the new middle-class coffee people.
Overall, through a small-N cross-national ethnography of regulars of specialty
coffee bars in Tehran, Glasgow and Amsterdam, the research contributes to the
literature on the proliferation of the new urban middle classes and the ways in
which they are developing particular urban lifestyles. After situating the research
in the current literature on the new urban middle classes, consumption, class
expression and specialty coffee, the methodology and findings of the research
will be presented.
The new urban middle classes and their polysemic rituals
of consumption
The new urban middle classes are not `new' according to their social composition
as they are part of the broader middle classes; as a social classification, they con-
stitute a rather heterogeneous, ambiguous, elusive category of people. Engaged in
occupations that require significant levels of human capital, they are typically
categorised as neither too rich nor too poor, broadly able to lead a comfortable

life, enjoying stable housing, healthcare, educational opportunities and discretion-
ary disposable income to spend on vacation and leisure pursuits (Kharas and
Gertz, 2010; Mathur, 2010). Their newness is considered primarily by their profes-
sional class, based on knowledge rather than property, which is highly related to
post-industrial societies and post-Fordist production logics. They appear to con-
stantly redefine middle-class identity and are often celebrated for having liberal
attitudes yet marked by new consumption practices associated with resource-
intensive lifestyles (Lange and Meier, 2009). Their educational background,
additionally, assists them to subjectively differentiate themselves from old, trad-
itional middle classes through their engagement with political debates as well as a
broad, eclectic taste in cultural items. Thus, the concept refers to more than just an
income group: it comprises social, political, environmental and economic dimen-
sions and likewise operates as a cultural construct combining both tradition and
modernity in its ideologies and consumption styles (Anantharaman, 2014; Jayne,
2006).
The reasons behind consumption practices of the new urban middle class are
many and anything but univocal or coherent and can be configured in various
ways. From theories of practice, this class can be grasped as a class-in-practice,
defined by its everyday, mundane consumption practices through which they per-
form their social position (Warde, 2014). According to Bourdieu's (1984) theory
of distinction, this class employs consumption as a communicator and a sign of
distinction in order to subjectively and objectively define and demarcate their social
position. In so doing, members of this class express their identities through
symbolic representation in taste and lifestyle and a desired focus on symbolic
rather than material rewards (Warde, 2015).
Besides public performance and symbolic class expression, they share a vision of
consumer sovereignty, a desire for a certain quality of life that involves both
collective goods (the neighbourhood and the city where they live in as well as
environmental concerns, equality and democracy) and private happiness.
Today's new urban middle classes tend to operate around the idea that they can
and must control themselves through, among other things, looking after their
bodies, state of health and the environment (Sassatelli, 2007). They are what
Cohen (2000) would call `citizen consumers', who simultaneously fulfil personal
desires and civic obligations through their consumption practices.
Concepts of identity, lifestyle, distinction and consumption practice of the new
urban middle classes, moreover, converge in the aestheticisation of everyday life.
Within contemporary consumer culture, lifestyle connotes individuality, self-
expression, aesthetic reflexivity and stylistic self-consciousness. One's body, clothes,
speech, leisure pastimes, eating and drinking preferences, choice of holidays, envir-
onmental concerns and political orientation are to be regarded as indicators of the
individuality of taste and aesthetic sense of style (Featherstone, 2007; Latham,
2003). Arguably, the new urban middle classes engage an invisible ink strategy
to objectively and subjectively demarcate their class boundaries, the symbolic,
embodied and experiential aspects of their class aesthetics (Guthman, 2003).
Shaker Ardekani and Rath 3
With their high cultural and economic resources, the new urban middle classes
reject mass-produced, standardised and impersonal commodities and embrace
goods and services that are designed to cater to a personal sense of worth.
They increasingly look towards emotional and intimate commodities, exemplified
by the recent proliferation of artisanal goods, the move towards quality in gourmet
food and beverages, the growth of personal fitness and beauty products, the expan-
sion of the tourist trade and travelling agencies, the exponential rise of the catering
and hospitality industries, the growth in the home-improvement sector and the
personalisation of pharmaceuticals (Michalski, 2015; Townsend and Sood, 2012).
Socially constructed and socially maintained, the new urban middle classes
manage their identities through the processes of public performance via placing
an emphasis on frequent visits to the everyday social spaces of lifestyles where they
can express, perform and practice their embodied and symbolic sense of class.
The new interest in artisanal market and recent engagement with aesthetic goods
and services, such as, among others, craft beer bars, specialty coffee bars, wine
bars, fusion restaurants, artisanal bakeries, vintage shops, ethnic catering and
ethnic therapies, indicate a fundamental shift in the consumption practices of the
new urban middle classes. In fact, through focusing on artisanship and sensual
experience, these new urban consumption spaces seem to be attractive for the new
urban middle classes who prefer natural, quality goods and services. Highly visible
signs of gentrification, these consumption spaces not only supply the material needs
of the new urban middle classes, but also the aesthetics of their offerings and
atmosphere provide cultural capital for these groups, validate the judgment of
their tastes and lifestyles and reinforce a sense of authentic self-expression and
creative cultural distinction (Zukin et al., 2015).
Despite the existing rich literature and current thick description of the new
urban middle classes, their consumption practices and styles of living, there are
few international studies on them. What qualities do they share? As a first inter-
vention to answering this broad question, we have narrowed down our scope of
investigation and focused on specialty coffee bars and their patrons. Coffee has
long been a part of daily diets and social rituals; however, like craft beer, cocktails,
tea, chocolate and bread, coffee is experiencing an artisanal spring. Some coffee
aficionados call this the third wave of coffee. Manzo (2010) provides a timeline
about the different coffee waves:
The first wave, according to the coffee geeks, refers to how coffee was prepared and
consumed in, say, the 1950s until, say, the early 1990s, when coffee was a caffeine
delivery system prepared in percolators or massive urns in offices and banquet halls.
The second wave refers to that period, starting in the early 1990s, when coffeehouse
chains (Starbucks, Gloria Jean's, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Second Cup, etc.)
were founded and became common features in urban storefronts and suburban malls.
The second wave purveyors, this history claims, laid the groundwork for the third
wave, which comprises small-batch artisanal coffee roasters and independent or small
chain coffeehouses that are themselves part of a supply chain including a collection of

field-to-cup actors starting with direct-trade growers with whom the coffee brokers,
roasters, and cafe owners are understood to have relationships. (p. 143)
Trendy, hip espresso bars and cool specialty coffeehouses are mushrooming in
almost all big cities across the globe, becoming synonymous with contemporary
urban living (Bookman, 2014). They have marked a distinct break with a past
characterised by mass production and consumption, distinguishing themselves by
providing high-quality coffees derived from distinct processes of planting, harvest-
ing, washing, drying, milling, roasting, grinding, brewing and cupping (Specialty
Coffee Association of America (SCAA), 2015).
Compared to other lifestyle goods and services such as chocolate, designer goods
or yoga classes, specialty coffee bars have not only appeared to be more visible in
the everyday urban sphere and attracted a wider section of urbanites but have also
shown how production and consumption has shifted from quantity towards quality
and from mass to niche markets. Providing high-profile products that reflect a
creative, aesthetic production and consumption, specialty coffee bars seem to be
the local manifestation of a certain mentality in which coffee is a way of life.
In other words, drinking specialty coffee is a way of actualising a philosophy of
life and a nonverbal communicative act of identity. As such, it entails elaborate
codes of conduct, sociability and aesthetic appreciation which are institutionally
sustained and enforced as well as subjectively learned through a self-disciplining
process.
The consumption of relatively expensive specialty coffee, moreover, is under-
stood to contain numerous social, cultural, sensual, embodied and symbolic mean-
ings by which everyday needs and consumption are linked to identities and
lifestyles of the new urban middle classes. Coffee people seek to practice their
sense of class and to differentiate themselves from the dullness of mass culture
by consuming quality products. In other words, sipping coffee is not only about
drinking coffee but also about navigating through countless tastes, flavours and
smells of coffee, selecting a specific coffee bean coming from a specific country and
farm, derived from a distinct process, brewed and cupped by a skilled, professional
barista, using a certain type of machine and equipment, enriched by adding a
specific type and amount of sugar, syrup and milk. This occurs in a particular
space with a specific interior design fostering a leisurely ambiance within a par-
ticular neighbourhood. Simply put, where to go and what to drink have become
key avenues for class distinction and practice.
Data and methodology
What is assumed within the reviewed literature is that links are present between the
aesthetic consumption and class practices of the new urban middle classes and the
human capital derived from their educational background, occupational class
and social networks. The literature has little to say about shared traits and char-
acteristics that appear across seemingly vastly different contexts, with different
Shaker Ardekani and Rath 5
combinations of and interplays between their cultural and economic capital. In this
respect, via focusing on a cross-case analysis, this research investigates the shared
consumption practices and characteristics of new urban middle-class coffee people
in three cities crossing the conventional Global South and North research divide:
Tehran, Glasgow and Amsterdam.
These cases vary highly in terms of engagement in the global currents of
economy and culture. As a global city, Amsterdam has been involved with the
cognitive­cultural economy since the early stages of deindustrialisation (Shaker
Ardekani, 2016a). The city has managed to boost its economy through fostering
investment in cognitive and cultural sectors as well as advanced producer services
(Van der Waal, 2013). Under the banner of the creative city (Florida, 2002),
Amsterdam has successfully attracted a huge number of urban professionals with
high cognitive and cultural skills. Deindustrialisation, on the other hand, has left
Glasgow with some of the worst socio-economic problems in Britain. Yet, now the
city seems to be alluring the new middle classes through a process of re-urbanisa-
tion, seemingly finding its place amidst economic and cultural globalisation
through a host of energetic cultural­financial initiatives (Turok and Bailey,
2004). On the other side of the spectrum stands Tehran which, for a variety of
reasons, has weak connections with the global process of urban development, and
the current literature has little to say about its local specificities particularly regard-
ing the class practices of its new urban middle classes (Shaker Ardekani, 2016b).
The selected cities, moreover, differ in terms of the rigidity of their class systems.
Economic background and the class of origin hierarchically differentiate social
groups within Tehran; however, the class compositions in Glasgow and, to a
higher degree, in Amsterdam derive mostly from occupation, education and cul-
tural competencies. The nature of public urban culture also varies considerably and
casts an important role for frequenting coffee bars. It could be argued that specialty
coffee bars in Glasgow and Amsterdam are more or less gender-neutral urban
spaces, and patronising them goes along with Bourdieu's theory of distinction as
well as theories of practice. In Tehran, however, coffee shops are evidently a
more gendered urban space and encourage the pseudo-emancipation of women
promoting a sense of aesthetic socio-political resistance (Shaker Ardekani, 2015a,
2015b, 2016b).
Using qualitative ethnographic research methods in a small-N cross-national
study, the investigation analyses regulars of specialty coffee bars within and
between the selected cities. The within-case comparison is of central importance
and contributes to the depth of the research and guides the study to identify
common patterns of regulars, their characteristics, motivations and social prac-
tices. In other words, our ethnographic research has provided us with a means
through which it is possible to analyse the culture of coffee people from the
perspective of its members. Unlike ethnographies in one setting, cross-national
ethnography allows us to directly reflect upon the structural, underlying factors
that explain the shared class practices of the new urban middle classes in different
urban societies.

The article draws upon research conducted between July 2015 and March 2016 on
specialty coffee consumption. As signs of gentrification, coffeehouses were selected
based upon their location in gentrified/ing neighbourhoods and/or areas where the
middle classes live. It is also noteworthy that specialty coffee markets are increasingly
differentiated, along with fine lines such as between chains and branded coffeehouses
and a host of so-called third wave, more independent hipster cafe
´ s. In order to cap-
ture this substantive variety, we have focused on both types. As there are no global
chain coffeehouses in Tehran, local chain and independent specialty coffee establish-
ments in all three cities have been investigated. Four coffeehouses within each city,
one locally chain-based and three independents, in total, 12 cases, have been selected.
The methodology involves unobtrusive observations in conjunction with inter-
views to examine the attitudes, characteristics and consumption practices of coffee
people. Both the narrative accounts of respondents and direct observations of their
class practices have been employed. Interviews have been conducted with both
baristas and visitors. First-timers, passer-by visitors and people who are not
engaged with the specialty coffee culture and, for instance, come to espresso bars
only for Wi-Fi have been excluded from the study. Participants have been recruited
from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds based on age (between 17
and 64 years old), gender, ethnicity and social activities they are engaging in
(socialising, leisure and working/productivity; Gelmers and Rath, 2015). In total,
the qualitative data consist of 240 hours of observations and 60 semi-structured in-
depth interviews. Lasting between 60 and 180 minutes, observations were made at
different times on both weekdays and weekends as a source for observing variations
based on customers and social practices. Out of 60 interviews, 12 were conducted
with baristas and 48 with regulars. The questions were primarily open-ended, in a
semi-structured fashion. Participants were asked about their socio-economic back-
grounds, their choice of coffeehouse, coffee connoisseurship, as well as consump-
tion and cultural practices to explore the ways in which they understand,
rationalise and respond to their everyday urban living.
The shared characteristics of coffee people in Tehran,
Glasgow and Amsterdam
The new urban middle classes, as an extraordinarily complex group with unclear
boundaries, employ myriad forms of, sometimes, competing cultural capital,
mainly through aesthetic consumption in order to practice their social position
and/or hierarchically differentiate themselves. In this light, the consumption of
specialty coffee within relaxed, conspicuous environments has become a compo-
nent of their expressive class identities bound up with the performance of cultural
capital and processes of distinction. For instance, Rosa, 29, a social worker in
Amsterdam explains the self-reflexivity of patrons of coffee bars:
I think there is a kind of culture to go to such a scene like this to kind of not showing
off but kind of to say `Hello, here I am' . . . I guess because people want to be part of a
Shaker Ardekani and Rath 7
community or group to tell that `Hey, watch me, I'm successful; I have that
iPhone, that MacBook, or clothes'. I think it's a subculture very similar to
cocktails . . . It is interesting, which shows you have a lot of time and money and
know about coffee. I also think a part of people [being here] here [is] to show
themselves.
It seems that specialty coffee bars can be considered as a space of representation or a
space of practice within which particular representations of identity, power and hier-
archy become visible. These urban spaces cater to a `certain crowd' as Maryam, 24, an
architect in Tehran argues:
We are going towards specialised, professional products . . . for example, this place
with fresh, quality, homemade sweets, sandwiches, and salads, which is its pride,
serves mostly for a certain type of people . . . As far as I know about this place and
its managers, they are all professional in their jobs. They are highly selective and
restrictive about their baristas, staff, coffee beans, and equipment . . . It is not a
small, little sinking coffee shop; they play good music and the crowd is a certain
crowd . . . I think it entices you to maybe stay longer or even order more . . .
James, 36, a barista in Amsterdam, describes the certain coffee crowd in
Amsterdam:
They are mostly white and middle-class people, I would say. They would have some
sort of more educated background, so lots of people who like wine tasting and food
tasting also like specialty coffee . . . Here also a lot of start-up people and creative
people come . . . Young professionals also use the place as their office. You know,
they sit here with their laptops . . . I have some customers coming two times a day,
in the morning and afternoon and spending about E10. Like, you usually see people
come in wearing nice clothes, expensive shoes, nice watches, very expensive laptops,
the latest smartphones, that's kind of a package and inventing in everything with
quality . . . We also have a lot of expats and students here . . . Another category
might be like housewives and moms [who] don't work. Moms with kids and house-
wives come here to meet friends and have a cup of coffee together . . .
Alireza, 28, a PhD graduate also lists the similar fraction of society frequenting
specialty coffeehouses in Tehran:
I cannot see all types of people here . . . Mostly young people like us, students,
you know . . . I also can see a certain type of people based upon their income, which
is obvious to me from their behaviours, clothes, and styles . . . They are mostly
high-income and from upper-middle families, they have enough money to spend on
these expensive coffees . . . There are some schools around here, so a lot of students,
a lot of families with or without children . . . It's mostly people, I think, between
20 and 40.

Not surprisingly, Maria, 23, a general practitioner in Glasgow classifies coffee
people as
Coffee people with higher education because, first of all, you do have to have
money . . . Also, people are here like looking good and careful about their
clothes . . . I think people here are self-conscious and educated in general.
Specialty coffee bars in studied cities seem to predominantly attract a certain
group: students, university staff, high-income urban professionals, managerial
workers (the so-called knowledge workers), entrepreneurs, other (well paid) private
sector workers, cool creative hipsters. They tend to be mostly young and well
educated, having high human capital and working in sectors such as software,
IT, finance, personal services and a wide array of cultural industries ranging
from music and media to fashion-intensive crafts.
Our empirical data also suggest that coffee people tend to insatiably search for
new and different aesthetic experiences. Converting their human capital into an
abstract taste, they navigate through a broad set of culturally expressive activities,
bodily self-surveillance and environmentally awareness. Although the ethnographic
data acknowledge the diversity of class practices, regulars share a set of interrelated
qualities visible through their everyday consumption practices. Three of these key
qualities involve the body, cosmopolitanism and environmentalism.
The metropolitan body
Bourdieu (1984) has argued that bodies and their associated consumption practices
are classed. Rosa, James, Alireza and Maria have implicitly mentioned that coffee
people tend to pay close attention to the surfaces which are under their direct
control, that is, the body. The tendency of coffee people towards the public
performance of self is most noticeable in their engagement in their public bodies,
in how they present themselves in their clothes, speech, manners, posture, appear-
ance and decoration of bodies (Featherstone, 2010). Analyses of the behaviours of
coffee people suggest that appearance, body shape and physical control as having
become increasingly central to their sense of identity. A variety of bodily norms of
appearance in the form of clothing and adornment or even tattooing and piercing
are fundamental to mark social identity.
Almost all of the participants reveal that they place a great emphasis on their
appearance, display and the management of impressions, a form of body-conscious
style through methods of somatic improvement such as diet, sports, yoga and a
whole host of bodily practices and disciplines. For example, Angela, 35, a fashion
designer in Amsterdam explains her attention to balancing health, appearance and
happiness:
When I was younger, I tended to do a lot of exercise like ballet, and extracurricular
[sports]. But I think when you are working full time, it is kind of hard to go to the gym
Shaker Ardekani and Rath 9
as much as you want to . . . but I try to exercise, so I go to the gym and do yoga but
half of it for fitness and half of it for like stress relief . . . I also go running for being fit
and healthy . . . just like an old way of being fit and organising thoughts.
Clair, 28, a post-doc student and a young mom in Glasgow also expresses how she
uses the available opportunities to work on her body:
As a mom, I am trapped home for the whole day taking care of my baby girl so it's
nice to be somewhere else if I could . . . so I go to buggy fitting. With a group of other
moms, we go to Kelvingrove Park buggying.
If the previous waves of coffee have been about common tastes, mass production
and massive bodies, the artisanal, third wave of coffee seems to be about construc-
tion and representation of refined (or reflexive) tastes, craft production and crafted
bodies. For instance, Morteza, 25, a barista in Tehran defines his body as an
instrument, a professional, portable toolkit for his job:
For improving my tasting and sensory skills, I have stopped smoking and drinking
alcohol, become a vegetarian, and also started exercising and hiking . . . I have devoted
a lot of my time to sports which is really important to me and my job . . . I go for
swimming, volleyball, football, table tennis, and parkour . . . I am also following a
healthy diet and even use some sports and diet apps on my iPhone to keep track of
my progress . . .
It shows that the body has changed from a biological fact into a project (Giddens,
1991), a performance (Goffman, 1959), a lifestyle accessory to be sculpted, shaped
and `stylised' (Featherstone, 1991). As a vehicle of pleasure and self-expression, the
body needs to be maintained and requires servicing, regular care and attention to
preserve maximum efficiency. The body as a malleable phenomenon reflects social
and cultural forces, a fleshy testimonial to the aestheticisation of everyday life.
Engagement with specialty coffee in itself represents an embodied practice or a
set of ongoing practices of corporalisation. Coffee people's embodiment is a life
process that requires the learning of bodily techniques such as walking, sitting,
drinking, tasting and so forth. The coffee embodiment is the ensemble of these
corporal practices that produces and gives the body its place in everyday coffee
spaces. Coffee people, furthermore, are feeling bodies rather than disembodied
minds; this embodiment requires an acquired taste, a certain type of connoisseur-
ship, a sensual experience and expertise of navigating through different tastes and
flavours of coffee. The third wave of coffee is about sourcing beans from farms
instead of countries, and roasting is about bringing out rather than incinerating the
unique characteristics of each bean and its flavour. Simply put, embodiment is the
lived experience of the sensual or subjective body (Turner, 2008). Coffee people
through the conversion of their cultivated disposition into distinct types of embo-
died capital, that is, sensual and physical, grasp a sense of self-esteem and
10 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)
confidence to be better able to move through interpersonal spaces of sociability to
enjoy the full range of lifestyle opportunities and pleasures on offer (Shilling, 2003).
Marco, 41, a university professor in Glasgow, for instance, shows his sensual
embodiment:
There is so much variety and by now it is very difficult for me to navigate. But if you
ask me what is your favourite by recollection, I would tell you it is the Colombian
blend that they have here. I am not a huge fan of AeroPress and I mostly stick to
espresso . . .
Our observations, additionally, suggest that the presentation of the body within
specialty coffee bars seems not to be just about the embodiment of cultural capital
but also the power to affect others (Featherstone, 2010). The use of refined goods,
appropriate body style, crafted coffee taste, clothing, make-up, adornment and, in
general, the representation of cultivated sensual and physical capital are some
sort of signs, the constructed bodies of what coffee people want others to see.
They represent what Laura Mulvey (1975) has called scopophilia (the love of
gazing), affective metropolitan bodies. In this sense, specialty coffee bars change
into a stage of gaze, a cultural place to see and to be seen. In return, as the spectator
stands as a co-creator (Wegenstein, 2012), coffee people provide an outward image
and seek confirmation through returned glances and exchanged smiles.
Cosmopolitanism
Having access to rich cultural and economic resources, the interviewees have shown
to be culturally flexible and aware. The taste-making capability of human-capital-
heavy groups enables them to associate with a wide range of cultural engagements
and leisure activities (Wright, 2011). They appear to be curious and hold an
abstract taste for a variety of cultural items, a specific attitude towards the appre-
ciation of various (non)local goods. As an aesthetic disposition, they possess
cosmopolitan/multicultural capital, which makes it a tool to assert their distinctive
identity, an orientation of openness towards cultural others, systems of beliefs and
competencies (Meuleman and Savage, 2013). Participants elaborate that they
search for new cultural experiences such as dining out and trying different cuisines,
travelling, learning new languages, listening to vast musical genres, watching
various types of movies, reading practices and following a variety of news.
For example, Pepijn, 35, a financial manager in Amsterdam explains his very
broad tastes in cultural activities:
I listen to almost anything. I'm interested in lots of 80s and 90s, rock, metal, jazz, hip
hop, punk, blues, and folk music . . . I also love travelling, yesterday my girlfriend said
`I want to go to a holiday', and then we decided to go to Kazakhstan. We[`ll] go there
for 3 weeks. I guess it is a cheap place to go to . . . We also love different foods, and it
doesn't matter what kitchen it is; we go everywhere and try different
Shaker Ardekani and Rath 11
things . . . Tomorrow we'll go to a Mongolian restaurant. I've been there like three
times but it is really amazing. We also have an Afghani restaurant but I guess the
Mongolian kitchen is rougher . . . When I go out with friends, we try the Lebanese
kitchen and why not even Chinese. If we have time, we would also check out Greek,
Albanian, Thai, Spanish, French, and Turkish food.
Mina, 35, a sales manager in Tehran also describes her taste in news:
For my profession, I follow the economic news of the world . . . I follow the news every
day at 8 a.m. and also read the paper when I'm here. I have some news apps on my
phone, so I could check to see what's happening. Also on the Internet, I check all the
headlines. But I follow a lot of economic news, and I go really in depth by reading
economic articles . . . We are also subscribed for some newspapers and receive them on
the daily basis, so we are constantly reading the news, and know what's going
on . . . I also follow the news you cannot ignore like the refugees, wars, political
situations. I'm also interested in cultural news, like about movies.
The presence of omnivorism (Peterson, 2005) among high-status groups requires of
individuals a form of `cultural tolerance' (Lizardo, 2014), the ability to cross
between `high' and `low' cultural boundaries in their cultural choices. For instance,
Sachi, 31, a post-doc student in Glasgow describes his reading habits:
I read a lot of different books such as the New York Times bestsellers. I also like to
read the classical English literature. However, in general, although I'm curious about
different things, I'm not interested enough to go deep into them. That's why I read a
lot of different texts such as humanities, philosophy, history, urban stuff, theology,
religion, sociology, cultural stuff, anthropology . . . Because my work is based on the
philosophy of technology, understanding technology and the relationship between
humans and technology, so I have to understand so many things . . . Also because of
the time pressure, I'm a big fan of short stories.
Coffee can itself be straightforwardly cosmopolitan in the sense that, through its
very substance, it invokes a certain worldliness. The consumption of specialty
coffees can be also viewed as a narrow form of cosmopolitan practice in the way
that it demonstrates the engagement in the otherness of the world. For Nima, 28, a
musician in Tehran
Third wave of coffee is mostly about sharing information and cultures of the coffee
you'd like to consume . . . With a shot of espresso, I can have a trip to Rwanda,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Brazil, Indonesia or any other coffee countries. You could simply
travel with just one cup of coffee to places you have never been.
In this regard, participants through reflexive engagement with the globe have
created a privileged lifestyle through cosmopolitan omnivorism as an intellectual
12 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)
disposition which can be conceptualised through aestheticising `the other' elements
and material practices and engagement with (non)local cultural goods in everyday
urban living.
Environmentalism
Another widely expressed characteristic of coffee people besides their bodily
aesthetics and cosmopolitan omnivorism is their awareness about the earth, sus-
tainability and environment. Our investigation suggests that the participants try to
complement their concern with their `internal environment' of bodily experience
(Shilling, 2008) through ecological orientations and green movements via activities
highlighting the importance of `looking after' the environment in parallel with
looking after themselves. For example, Aldert, 43, a manager in an insurance
company in Amsterdam shows his interests in environmental preservation:
When I was going to the university, I was really politically active and there is still an
ideology like that in me; but, of course, when you work, more energy goes to that
direction than the other. Because we work, we have enough money, and it's easier to
be politically correct, so we buy biological products and green stuff. We separate our
garbage and we do the stuff that is available to us but not much more . . . I also do
some volunteering but not directly related to the environment but still humanitarian
stuff, which relates, to some extent, to the environment.
The emergence of pro-environmental behaviours among the participants derives
from their responsible consumption by which eco-conscious and socio-economic-
ally privileged individuals practice and promote environmentally friendly lifestyles
as a way to contribute to the quality of life and better neighbourhood, city and
environment (Soron, 2010). As an extended impersonal form of cultivated cultural
capital that is embedded in the wider concept of civic responsibility (Lange and
Meier, 2009), environmental awareness contributes to the protection of nature
through redefining personal consumption patterns by taking the environment
into account while making purchasing decisions. Sharon, 59, a social worker in
Glasgow, describes her environmental practices:
From my personal, direct environment, I try not to make much trash, but I only use
the channels that are available like separating my garbage and putting them into
garbage bins or I don't put litter out on the street . . . Subconsciously, I think I try
not to pollute my direct environment. I also try to shop locally and use my bike for
doing stuff within my area.
By reflecting critically on the environment and guiding their consumption patterns
in sustainable directions, coffee people individualise and de-politicise the issue of
environmental responsibility. Rather than following the normative narrative that
environmental issues must be solved through political decision-making,
Shaker Ardekani and Rath 13
interviewees have typically expressed that they have personal actions to do and
individual sacrifices to make alongside large-scale political solutions. For instance,
Sahar, 25, an art student in Tehran describes her personal responsibilities to
`mother earth':
I agree with the existence of global warming and think it needs very serious large-scale
political actions to be taken to tackle this threatening gloomy danger. However, per-
sonally, I believe that I have some responsibilities for mother earth. My actions are
indeed small but still better than nothing and could make some small changes. I try to
drive my car less, take the subway or public transportation to go to the university or
when I go out with friends. I also walk a lot for short distances, try to eat a lot of
vegetarian foods instead of meat . . . In general, I try to be kind to mother earth . . .
The consumption of transparent, fair trade coffee has appeared to be another
moral regulator of coffee people. As a specific type of humanitarian value, our
participants have argued that they are worried about the process of coffee produc-
tion and people involved in, especially in countries or at the farms of origin.
For example, Charlotte, 29, a freelancer in Amsterdam says,
There are certain concerns about the people who grow the coffee we drink. Coffee
grows in specific countries and because of its high demand, more people are engaged
with the process from planting and harvesting to brewing and cupping . . . I've heard
that in some farms, children pick coffee beans in condition just like some sort of
sweatshops . . . I don't like to drink coffee coming from that situation . . . I'm willing
to pay some extra for my coffee in favour of those kids and for creating a more
transparent coffee process.
There is a distinction between citizen consumers and customer consumers. Coffee
people seem not to be mere consumers who seek primarily to maximise their per-
sonal interests but they also take on the responsibility through association with
citizenship and considering the general good through their consumption.
Discussion and conclusion
Our study of coffee people in Tehran, Glasgow and Amsterdam suggests that class
compositions are not entirely the same and occupational class, education, cultural
know-how and class of origin all strongly condition the attributes of consumption
and load heavily on the participants' lifestyles. Despite the different make-up, pace,
scale and spread of the new urban middle classes within the studied cities, with
regard to their everyday consumption patterns, they share some common traits,
ethical dispositions and cultural practices. We have argued that coffee people show
a remarkable convergence in their attitudes and behaviours in their everyday urban
life. Patronising third wave coffee bars as an embodied practice revolves around a
particular construction and representation of the physical and sensual body
14 Journal of Consumer Culture 0(0)
through consuming a global commodity with environmental/moral connotations.
Moreover, possessing adequate economic and cultural resources, our interviewees
have revealed that, alongside their embodied expressive lifestyles, they participate
actively in the engagement with the global cultural others via their omnivorous
tastes and cosmopolitan attitudes as part of the global cultural capital in the con-
text of environmental concerns and responsible consumption. Coffee people as a
group within the new urban middle classes enjoy the consumption styles of life, feel
comfortable with foreign/other cultures and value-systems and are aware of the
environmental challenges.
Drawing upon several streams of research and scholarship and combining often
weakly integrated analytical schools of thought including theories of consumption,
practice, distinction, consumer sovereignty, the body, cosmopolitanism, omnivor-
ism, sustainability and environmentalism, we have shown that the aesthetic con-
sumption practices of the new urban middle classes are driven by a conscious
reflexivity to develop their social identities and relations. Their embodied practices
of consumption and orientation towards a wide range of cultural items and leisure
activities in conjunction with environmental concerns suggest a new objective and
subjective notion of class. In return, the urban landscape is now predominantly
lined with hoardings non-local consumer goods, spaced out by fair trade and green
consumption amenities and marked by leisure spaces, while the body is often
shaped by the latest fashion items and somatic improvements and signalled by
the latest portable technologies.
What we have observed in Amsterdam and Glasgow reflects a commonplace
urban agenda in many other cities in advanced economies. Because of deindustrial-
isation, neoliberalism and globalisation, cities are now considering facilitating the
clustering of advanced producer services and cultural amenities in order to boost
their economies through attracting professionalised workforce with high levels of
cognitive and cultural skills. These new social classes have gravitated to inner cities
and transformed the retail landscape of neighbourhoods through their search for
consumption spaces that fit their distinctive lifestyles. Additionally, the new urban
middle classes have acquired more power and become agents of change, promoting
new styles of consumption which potentially cut across traditional social divisions
and may contribute to solve environmental challenges and transform towards more
sustainable societies.
The rise of the new urban middle classes in Tehran, on the other hand, seems to
be a result of increasing availability of disposable incomes in their hands and
educational pursuits of young urbanites, which have modified their styles of
living and consumption patterns. There are several other studies suggesting that
during the past several decades consumption patterns in the Global South and the
emerging economies such as China, India, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil
have considerably changed with an increased proportion of expenditures being
spent on housing, transport, recreation, education, clothing and other aesthetic
commodities (Artigas and Calicchio, 2007; Dobbs et al., 2012; Drabble et al.,
2015). It could be also argued that the rise of the new middle classes around the
Shaker Ardekani and Rath 15
globe is anchored in the convergent socio-cultural, political, economic and envir-
onmental values.
In addition to the meta-concepts such as cultural globalisation, the global
spread of the new urban middle classes seems to be associated with the establish-
ment of certain cultural infrastructures and institutions which give the middle
classes opportunities of cultural reception, transmission and reproduction.
The developments of transport infrastructures and communication technologies
during the late 20th century have facilitated the global circulation of ideas, meta-
phors, sign systems and meaning-making practices. In return, the new urban
middle classes who have money, time, confidence and motivation to catalyse
significant transformations in their societies, especially within the Global South,
through a cultural synchronisation emanating from the West and a combination of
consumption and investment in their human capital have resulted in lifestyles which
are not locally bounded anymore and the emergence of the North in the South.
Our study has highlighted that how comparing and analysing regulars of spe-
cialty coffee bars, their motivations, characteristics and activities could shed light
on the larger societal trends and talk about structural changes in the composition
of the world population, economy, values and ideology. It also draws attention to
how micro-level analyses can provide macro-level insights on the class structural
changes within individual societies and class dynamics brought about by global-
isation. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the new urban middle classes are
conceptually very complex and cannot be reduced to refer to a homogenised
group with a clear boundary. Furthermore, our investigation has merely focused
on the qualities that coffee people share through their mundane, everyday con-
sumption patterns. We have observed some other common ground among the
coffee people such as their liberal attitudes and political preferences fostering dem-
ocracy and socio-political stability by improving social cohesion. As these shared
mentalities could not be fully grasped through the consumption practices, further
interdisciplinary investigation on the class practices of the new urban middle classes
seems necessary.
