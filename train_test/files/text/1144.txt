Is Television Viewing Associated
With Social Isolation?
Roles of Exposure Time, Viewing Context, and Violent Content
David S. Bickham, PhD; Michael Rich, MD, MPH
Objective: To estimate associations between children's
peer integration and amount of time they spend (1) watch-
ing television, (2) watching violent television, and (3) co-
viewing television with friends.
Design: Survey using nationally representative data from
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics­Child Develop-
ment Supplement Wave 1.
Setting: Nationwide survey of families with young chil-
dren performed in 1997.
Participants: Of 3562 children, 1356 had sufficient data
for inclusion in analyses (563 children aged 6 to 8 years
and 793 children aged 9 to 12 years).
Main Exposure: Total time viewing television, with and
without friends present, and time viewing violent and non-
violent television content.
Main Outcome Measure: Amountoftimechildrenspent
with friends as reported in two 24-hour activity diaries.
Results: Viewing violent programs (but not nonviolent
programs) was negatively related to time children spent
with friends (aged 6-8 years, unstandardized regression
coefficient [] = - 0.34, 95% confidence interval
[CI],-0.59 to-0.08; aged 9-12 years, =-0.41, 95%
CI,-0.65 to-0.18). More time viewing television with
friends was associated with more time engaging in other
activities with friends (aged 6-8 years, =0.98, 95% CI,
0.61 to 1.36; aged 9-12 years, =1.03, 95% CI, 0.72 to
1.34).
Conclusions: The more time that children spent view-
ing violent programs, the less time they spent with their
friends. While this study cannot determine the direction
of effects for this relationship, a cyclical process between
violent media and peer integration best explains the find-
ings. To optimize social development and mental health,
children's access to violent media should be limited.

It is a widely held belief that the time
children spend with media displaces more
valuable pursuits.7-9 Once activities such
as eating, sleeping, and self-care are ac-
counted for, children have roughly 51
hours of discretionary time each week.10
Recent studies have found that on aver-
age, school-aged American children spend
approximately 27 hours a week watching
television.11 It is easy to understand, there-
fore, how television viewing is seen as in-
terfering with children's important devel-
opmental activities.
Peer interaction allows children the op-
portunity to develop social skills and build
relationships.12 Research on the relation-

Assuming television simply displaces peer interac-
tions underestimates the complex role it has in chil-
dren's lives. Television is a rich medium that can teach a
variety of social behaviors. Meta-analyses conclude that
viewing violent television increases children's antisocial
behaviors and decreases their positive social behav-
iors.16-18 Such negative social behaviors can lead to so-
cial isolation, while positive social behaviors can lead to
successful peer relationships.19-22 The content of televi-
sion, therefore, may be at least as important to chil-
dren's social integration as the time they spend with the
medium.23
The context in which television is viewed may also in-
fluencechildren'ssocialinteractions.Whiletelevisionview-
ing is often perceived as an isolating activity, it frequently
occurs in the company of friends.24 Because socializing
builds interpersonal skills,12 television viewing with friends
may provide a venue for these skills to develop.
While television may isolate children, the reverse causal
direction is also plausible--lonely children may turn to
television for entertainment and companionship. Chil-
dren who are marginalized by their peers use television
to escape the stresses of their lives and meet their social
needs.25 Conversely, children who are socially integrated
spend less time watching television.26-29 In this model, it
is social isolation that motivates media use. Overall, it is
most likely that both effects occur--children who watch
more television become more socially isolated, which leads
them to spend more time watching television.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent
to which television viewing is associated with children's
peer integration. It tests the hypothesis that the more time
children watch television, the less time they spend with
their friends. Additionally, children's exposure to vio-
lent and nonviolent programs will be distinguished to de-
termine the independent relationship of these 2 types of
content with peer integration. Finally, this study inves-
tigates whether coviewing television is linked to the
amount of time children spend with friends not watch-
ing television.
METHOD
DATA
Data for this study were drawn from the Panel Study of In-
come Dynamics­Child Development Supplement (PSID-
CDS) Wave 1 collected in 1997.30 Since 1968, the PSID has been
an ongoing, nationally representative panel study of adults con-
ducted by the Survey Research Center at the Institute for So-
cial Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. In 1997, the
CDS was added and included a battery of questionnaires for
families with children aged 6 months to 12 years. It resulted in
data representing 3562 children.
Data collection procedures for the PSID-CDS were ap-
proved by the University of Michigan institutional review board,
and the analytical protocol was approved by the University of
Texas at Austin institutional review board.
Time-use diaries were used to collect detailed information
about children's activities. This method yields the most com-
plete, valid, and reliable data possible without an extraordi-
nary commitment of time or money.10,31 It is less costly and in-
trusive than observational methods and less likely to be socially
biased than summative self-reports.32 Time-use diary reports
of children's television viewing have been validated by com-
parison with observational data from videotapes made of the
child's home.33
On 2 randomly chosen days (1 weekend and 1 weekday),
primary caregivers completed comprehensive time-use dia-
ries. The primary caregiver, with help from the child when ap-
propriate, accounted for every minute of activity performed by
their child for 24-hour periods from midnight to 11:59 PM the
next night. Along with duration of activities, parents reported
location, other people who were present, and any secondary
concurrent activity. When television was the primary activity
reported, the title of the program or movie viewed was also re-
quested.
Two coders used their own knowledge and information
gained from Web sites to determine the presence of violence
in each show reported by the participants. News, sports, and
other nonfiction programs contained widely variable content
and were not coded. Programs were considered violent if vio-
lence was a central theme to the program. These programs gen-
erally depicted considerably more violence than normally ex-
ists in most children's lives and often included main characters
whose profession included responding to or participating in vio-
lence. The coders reached an appropriate level of interrater re-
liability (=0.81).
The number of minutes each child watched television as a
primary or secondary activity was computed by summing ev-
ery instance of viewing broadcast, cable, or videos reported in
the time-use diaries for both days. Viewing of violent and non-
violent content was similarly calculated. Mean values for view-
ing are presented in Table 1.
SUBSAMPLES
Only children 6 years and older were included in this study be-
cause it is at this age, around school entry, when children begin
shiftingtheirsocialfocusfromfamilytopeers.34,35 Analyseswere
performedseparatelyfor6-to8-year-oldsand9-to12-year-olds.
This study used 2 subsamples from the PSID-CDS. The
television viewing subsample contained 1356 children of the

total sample (n = 3562) who returned 2 time-use diaries and
had complete data on variables in the models. This subsample
was used in analyses that considered total television viewing
and viewing context. The television viewing subsample
included 563 children aged 6 to 8 years and 793 children aged
9 to 12 years.
The violent content viewing subsample consisted of 1015
children from the television viewing subsample whose diaries
contained 70% or more codeable data. This subsample
included 411 children aged 6 to 8 years and 604 children aged
9 to 12 years.
MEASURING TIME SPENT WITH FRIENDS
Peer integration was operationalized as the amount of time chil-
dren spent with their friends. Because the time-use diaries in-
cluded a report of people present during activities, it was pos-
sible to determine the total amount of time each child spent
with his or her friends during the 2 days. The time children
watched television with their friends was also calculated and
subtracted from the total amount of time they spent with their
friends to prevent overlap between the independent variable
(ie, television viewing) and dependent variable (ie, time with
friends). The mean and standard deviation of time with friends
(no television) and time watching television with friends are
provided in Table 1.
COVARIATES
The PSID-CDS contains multiple family and child level vari-
ables that may contribute to children's television exposure
and/or peer integration. The following were included in analy-
ses as control variables: (1) age in years was included to con-
trol for age differences within each age group (overall mean
[SD] age, 9.05 [2.04] years); (2) sex was coded with girls as 1
and boys as 0 (girls, n=683, boys, n=673); (3) parental edu-
cation was determined by the number of years of education
completed by the head of each child's household (mean [SD],
12.67 [2.73] years); (4) the primary caregiver's report of total
family income in 1996 was divided by the Census Bureau
poverty threshold for that size family to determine the
income-to-needs ratio36 (mean [SD], 2.92 [3.74]); (5) chil-
dren who were reported to have a race/ethnicity of black, His-
panic, Asian, Native American, or other were considered to be
minorities (minority, n=706; nonminority, n=650); (6) the
Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment
short form37 combines observational items completed by the
researcher and self-report questions completed by the partici-
pant to measure emotional support and cognitive stimulation
parents provide their children (scores were standardized
within age groups); (7) the 6-item, 5-point Parental Warmth
Scale developed by Child Trends was used to measure warmth
of the relationship between child and parent38 (mean [SD],
4.33 [0.62]).
ANALYSIS PLAN AND DETAILS
Ordinary least squares regression was performed using
STATA 8.0 statistical software (Stata Corp, College Station,
Tex) to test the relationships between television viewing and
the amount of time children spent with their friends while
controlling for the variables listed previously. Sampling
weights were applied to all analyses to represent national esti-
mates and commands were used to help correct for noninde-
pendent, sibling data. Unstandardized regression coefficients
are reported to allow for the translation of results into mean-
ingful time-use differences.
RESULTS
TOTAL TELEVISION VIEWING
AND TIME WITH FRIENDS
The more time children spent watching television with-
out friends present, the less time they spent with their
friends engaging in other activities (Table 2). For 6- to
8-year-olds, the unstandardized coefficient of -0.21 can
be interpreted to indicate that a difference of 1 hour more
of television watched corresponded to a difference of about
13 minutes or, on average, 7.5% less time with friends.
For 9- to 12-year-olds, 1 hour more television watched
corresponded to about 19 fewer minutes (7.4%) spent
with friends.
VIOLENT/NONVIOLENT TELEVISION
AND TIME WITH FRIENDS
Table 3 presents the regression results for viewing each
of the 2 categories (violent and nonviolent) of televi-
sion programming. These 2 types of viewing were mod-
erately correlated with one another in each of the age
groups (children aged 6-8 years, r=0.36, P.001; 9-12
years, r=0.32, P.001).
The more time children spent watching violent tele-
vision without friends, the less non-television time they
spent with their friends. Among 6- to 8-year-olds, an ad-
ditional 1 hour of violent television viewing corre-
sponded to about 20 minutes (12.1%) less time spent with
friends. For 9- to 12-year-olds, viewing 1 additional hour
of violent television corresponded to 25 minutes (9.8%)

less time spent with their friends. Viewing nonviolent tele-
vision programming was not significantly related to the
amount of time children spent with their friends.
COVIEWING TELEVISION WITH FRIENDS
AND OTHER TIME WITH FRIENDS
The more time children of either age group spent co-
viewing television with their friends, the more time they
spent with their friends engaging in non-television ac-
tivities (Table 4). For 6- to 8-year-olds, 1 more hour of
watching television with friends corresponded to 59 min-
utes more time with their friends not watching televi-
sion. For 9- to 12-year-old children, each hour of tele-
vision viewing with friends corresponded to about 62
minutes more non-television time spent with friends.
COMMENT
This study used nationally representative data and time-
use diaries to investigate the relationship between tele-
vision viewing time, content, context, and peer integra-
tion.Aschildrenspentmoretotaltimewatchingtelevision,
they spent a small but significantly shorter amount of time
with friends not viewing television. The more violent tele-
vision programs that children watched, the less non-
television time they spent with friends. Viewing nonvio-
lent television programs had no effect on time spent with
friends. More time coviewing television with friends was
associated with more non-television time with friends.
These findings indicate that displacement is not a suffi-
cient explanation for observed relationships between chil-
dren's television viewing and social activities.
A PROCESS MODEL
There is strong evidence from many previous studies that
violent media contributes to children's antisocial behav-
iors, suggesting a plausible link between children's vio-
lent television exposure and peer integration. As chil-
dren watch more violent television, they become more
aggressive and exhibit fewer positive social behav-
iors.16-18 Aggressive behaviors have been associated with
peer rejection and less popularity.20,21,39 Increased ag-
gression influenced by viewing violent television may
prompt peers to reject and socially isolate the aggressive
child.
These data are correlational and cannot test causality
or the directions of relationships. An alternative expla-
nation for the results is that social isolation precedes in-
creased violent media use. As aggressive children be-
come more isolated from their peers, they have more
discretionary time that they then fill by watching televi-
sion. Because they are aggressive, these children may be
attracted to violent content.40,41
The model that may most accurately represent real-
world effects of violent television is one that synthesizes
both directions of influence into a cyclical process, a down-
ward spiral from violent television viewing to aggres-
sive behavior to social isolation to viewing more violent

fore, be the catalyst for a cyclical system leading toward
an aggressive, socially isolated lifestyle.
COVIEWING WITH FRIENDS
The more time children spent coviewing television with
friends, the more time they spent with their friends engag-
inginotheractivities.Again,itisimportanttoconsiderboth
directions of influence in the interpretation of this result.
Childrenmayforgestrongerrelationshipswiththeirfriends
around television and thus be more likely to continue their
interactions away from the medium. Alternatively, chil-
dren who regularly spend time with their friends may en-
gage in a variety of activities with them. Viewing televi-
sion together may be one activity in the repertoire of a rich
childhood friendship. Regardless of the direction of influ-
ence,thisfindingdoesnotsupportthehypothesisthatview-
ing television with friends interferes with relationships or
replaces other shared activities.
LIMITATIONS
The large number of television programs reported by the
participants of the PSID-CDS necessitated a limited vio-
lence coding procedure. Differing depictions of vio-
lence on television can influence the viewer in different
ways43; the binary, violent vs nonviolent coding used in
this study does not capture important yet subtle differ-
ences in content. Further research using more precise and
objective coding strategies is necessary to understand more
fully the relationship between violent television view-
ing and social isolation.
Although time-use diaries are a valid and accurate
method of measuring television viewing, they may be lim-
ited by recall bias because they are filled out for the pre-
vious day. Additionally, because diaries were collected
for 2 sample days, activities that occur rarely are likely
to be underrepresented. While 80% of children watch tele-
vision every day,11 viewing with friends is a much less
common activity and may be underreported in these data.
There was not enough coviewing reported to permit analy-
ses examining differences in viewing violent vs nonvio-
lent television programs with friends. Finally, the cross-
sectional nature of these data does not permit analyses
of the direction of influence between television viewing
and peer integration. Longitudinal research is necessary
to further examine the direction and strength of this re-
lationship.
CONCLUSIONS
The more time that children between the ages of 6 and
12 years spent watching violent television, the less time
they spent with their friends. This content-specific rela-
tionship indicates that television may not simply dis-
place peer interactions. At the time our study data were
collected, the National Television Violence Study found
this type of content was readily available to children--
61% of all television programs and 66% of children's pro-
gramming contained violence.44,45
These results demonstrate that it is important to con-
sider television content whenever investigating the re-
lationships between media use and behaviors. Other re-
search has reached similar conclusions with different
behavioral outcomes. Educational television viewing
among children in preschool has been shown to have long-
term positive effects on children's academic success,46
while early viewing of violence predicts aggression and
violent crime in adulthood.47
These findings expand and enrich our understand-
ing of the effects of television exposure on the healthy
social development of children. Violent television
viewing may influence younger children to be more
antisocial, resulting in their becoming socially isolated
which, in turn, attracts them to more violent media.
To optimize children's social development and long-
term mental health, parents, teachers, and pediatri-
cians should discourage the viewing of violent televi-
sion programs.
In response to these and other findings indicating
the potential effects of violent media, pediatricians
should incorporate media use histories in children's
health maintenance visits to determine how much time
children view television or play video games, what con-
tent they are exposed to, and with whom they view or
play. Special attention should be given to a child's
media exposure when there are indications of social iso-
lation, declining school performance, or aggressive,
anxious, or withdrawn behavior. Parents should be
urged to remove televisions, video games, and Internet
access from children's bedrooms and to budget media
use for school-aged children to time after all home-
work, sports, and social obligations have been com-
pleted. Parents should be encouraged to make them-
selves aware of their children's media use, watching
television or using other media with them, and discuss-
ing problematic content. Finally, pediatricians should
encourage the development of media literacy, the ability
to use media critically and to protect oneself, for both
children and parents. Aware of the potential risks to
their children's mental health and social development,
parents should model and enforce healthy and safe
media use habits in their homes.
