The authors assessed the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) and the personality factors termed the
``big 5'' (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness) represented
confounded or independent risks for all-cause mortality over a 10-year follow-up in the Midlife Development
in the United States (MIDUS) cohort between 1995 and 2004. Adjusted for demographics, the 25th versus
75th percentile of SES was associated with an odds ratio of 1.43 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.83).
Demographic-adjusted odds ratios for the 75th versus 25th percentile of neuroticism were 1.38 (95% CI: 1.10,
1.73) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.84) for conscientiousness, the latter evaluated at high levels of agreeableness.
Modest associations were observed between SES and the big 5. Adjusting each for the other revealed that
personality explained roughly 20% of the SES gradient in mortality, while SES explained 8% of personality risk.
Portions of SES and personality risk were explained by health behaviors, although some residual risk remained
unexplained. Personality appears to explain some between-SES strata differences in mortality risk, as well as
some individual risk heterogeneity within SES strata. Findings suggest that both sociostructural inequalities and
individual disposition hold public health implications. Future research and prevention aimed at ameliorating SES
health disparities may benefit from considering the risk clustering of social disadvantage and dispositional factors.

socioeconomic status.
All-cause mortality has consistently been associated with
both socioeconomic status (SES) (1­4) and personality traits
(5). These 2 factors are typically examined separately, as
each represents a different fundamental cause of health
outcomes: the societal stratification of wealth and resources
on one hand (6) versus an individual's basic behavioral and
psychological tendencies on the other (7).
At least 2 models may characterize the interface of SES,
personality, and all-cause mortality. First, SES and person-
ality may represent correlated or clustered risks. For
instance, the notion of indirect selection (8­10) suggests
that certain personality dispositions lead to both downward
social mobility and poor health (a confounding relation). A
cultural/behavioral mechanism model suggests that SES
shapes individual personality tendencies, which in turn
affect health (8) (a mediating relation). Either case indicates
a clustering of social disadvantage with dispositional risk
and the according possibility that personality explains
differences between SES strata in all-cause mortality. Some
findings support the notion of SES­personality correlation,
suggesting that SES influences childhood personality devel-
opment (11, 12), personality influences school achievement
(13, 14), and educational (15) and occupational (16, 17)
experiences shape personality and that adult economic
attainment may be linked to personality (18, 19).
A second alternative is that SES and personality consti-
tute independent mortality risks. Some studies report
minimal correlation between SES and personality factors
linked to all-cause mortality (20, 21). In this case, individual
personality would explain heterogeneity in all-cause
mortality risk within, rather than between, SES strata.
In a recent study of all-cause mortality in France, adjust-
ment of SES estimates for personality attenuated SES
relative risks by 24%­36% in men and 11% in women (9).

This has led to questions of whether similar evidence for
correlated risk models exists in other populations, the public
health significance of such correlated risks, and whether
similar evidence can be obtained by using the comprehen-
sive, empirically derived taxonomy of personality termed
the ``big 5'' (22). The big 5 system groups specific traits
along 5 superordinate dimensions (23, 24): neuroticism
(composed of traits related to emotional distress), extraver-
sion (composed of traits reflecting gregariousness, vigor,
positive emotions), openness to experience (comprising
traits such as intellect and novelty-seeking), conscientious-
ness (involving traits such as diligence, organization, reli-
ability), and agreeableness (made up of traits reflecting
compassion, cooperation, and trust).
We examined whether big 5 dimensions explained social
inequalities in all-cause mortality in the United States. The
causal direction of personality­SES associations--that is,
indirect selection versus cultural-behavioral mechanism
models (8)--cannot be distinguished when personality and
SES are measured contemporaneously. However, life-course
models would suggest bidirectional relations between SES
and personality (and probably health) over development
(10). Therefore, we consider any associations between per-
sonality and SES at baseline to reflect the product of recip-
rocal causal relations in operation since early development
(Figure 1). In estimating all-cause mortality risk, we inter-
pret attenuation of either personality or SES risk by the
other conservatively as confounding, rather than invoking
the strong temporal assumptions inherent in mediation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The Midlife Development in the United States national
cohort study conducted baseline data collection in 1995,
with 10-year all-cause mortality follow-up data released in
2007. Approved by ethical oversight boards, the study re-
cruited noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults aged
between 25 and 74 years by using random digit dialing in
1995 (25), of whom 70% completed a phone interview. Of
these, 87% returned an accompanying mail survey. Of the
4,244 individuals responding to at least the phone interview,
2,998 (71%) had data on all variables of interest, incomplete
data being due primarily to the survey. Multivariate logit
models indicated that the analysis sample did not differ from
the larger sample in terms of age or gender but had a slightly
higher average level of education (i.e., 3­4 years of college
with no degree vs. 1­2 years of college) (P < 0.001). We
assessed any bias arising from this with multiple imputation
(see below).
Study measures
Mortality status. In 2004­2005 during the 10-year
follow-up assessment, the names of individuals who could
not be contacted for interview were submitted to the US
National Death Index. The cause and date of death were
not released to protect participants' confidentiality. Individ-
uals identified as deceased by the National Death Index were
coded as deaths, while those reached for follow-up or
confirmed not deceased by the National Death Index were
coded as alive.
Socioeconomic status. SES was assessed by a compre-
hensive set of indicators (26, 27). These were as follows:
1) annual household income, 2) total assets, 3) education,
and 4) Duncan's socioeconomic index (28), a measure of
occupational prestige. To eliminate measurement error in
the observed SES indicators and overadjustment of 1 SES
indicator for several others, as well as to utilize a single SES
dimension with greater variability than its components, we
used factor scores from a factor analysis of SES indicators
(Web Table 1). (This information is described in the first of 8
supplementary tables; each is referred to as ``Web table'' in
the text and is posted to the Journal's website (http://aje.
oxfordjournals.org/).) We note, however, that factor analysis
cannot address measurement due to unobserved or omitted
indicators of a latent dimension. Indicators loaded as
expected on a general SES factor. We scaled factor scores
by the interquartile range. In other words, they remain con-
tinuous, but the odds ratio corresponding to a 1-unit increase
reflects the difference for an individual at the 25th versus
75th percentiles of SES.
Personality. The Midlife Development Inventory (29)
assessed the big 5. Each dimension is tapped by 4­7 specific
trait adjectives. Respondents rate how well each trait
describes them on a 4-point Likert scale from ``a lot'' to
``not at all.'' The Midlife Development Inventory was
developed from a large pool of big 5 trait adjectives (30)
by identifying the smallest number that accounted for 90%
of the variance in total scales scores, in an independent
sample (29). Cronbach's alpha estimates of internal consis-
tency for each scale were as follows: neuroticism, 0.74;
extraversion, 0.78; openness, 0.77; agreeableness, 0.80;
and conscientiousness, 0.58. To address measurement error
in the scales due to the observed indicators, we utilized
orthogonal factor scores. Items loaded as expected on the
big 5 factors (Web Table 2). As with SES, factor scores were
scaled by interquartile range.

Behavioral risk factors and demographics. Behavioral
risk factors were based on survey items and included current
or former smoker, lifetime history of heavy drinking (a year
during one's lifetime where, on average, women consumed
!4 or men !5 drinks at 1 setting, !3 times a week), obesity
(body mass index of !30 kg/m2), and physical inactivity
(moderate activity <1 time per month over the past year).
Demographics included age, female sex, and nonwhite race.
Statistical analysis
We first estimated the association between SES and
quintiles of each big 5 factor, using ordinal logit models.
Next, we fit a series of logistic regressions predicting all-
cause mortality. Although mortality rates were below the
threshold (10%) at which odds ratios approximate relative
risks, we retain the term ``odds ratio'' for precision. Model 1
contained only age, gender, and minority status. Model 2
included demographics plus SES. Model 3 included demo-
graphics plus the big 5. Model 4 included demographics,
SES, and the big 5. On the basis of the odds ratios from
models 2, 3, and 4, we computed the change in estimate of
the odds ratio for SES due to personality and for personality
due to SES (31) to quantify confounding. Model 5 adjusted
model 4 for health behaviors, again computing change in
estimates.

a Personality and SES are scaled by interquartile range: The odds ratio for personality traits corresponds to the 75th percentile versus the 25th percentile, while the odds ratio for SES
corresponds to the 25th percentile versus the 75th percentile. Traits are centered so that values of 0 correspond to the 25th percentile, while values of 0 for SES correspond to the 75th
percentile.

Using model 2­4 estimates, we also computed adjusted
population attributable fractions (32, 33) to gauge the public
health impact of disadvantageous SES and personality
attributes. A reference level of the 25th percentile was used
for factors conferring risk and the 75th for those conferring
benefit. Secondary analyses examined the SES distribution
and mortality risk of specific traits forming each composite
big 5 dimension (34).
Sensitivity analyses examined the change in estimate in
SES for all 32 combinations of adjustment for the big 5
factors. Linearity in the logit was assessed with fractional
polynomials (35). Also screened were interactions between
traits of the big 5 with one another and with gender, age, and
SES on both multiplicative and additive scales (36). We
examined missing data bias using multiple imputation (37)
and whether correcting random measurement error in health
behaviors increased their capacity to explain observed SES/
personality risks, using simulation extrapolation (38). The
simulation step of the simulation extrapolation method
1) fits the initial model and then 2) iteratively refits the
model, each time multiplying the error term by an increas-
ingly higher scaling factor representing increasing degrees
of measurement error. The resulting trend in estimates under
increasing measurement error is then used to extrapolate
back to an estimate involving no measurement error (38).
Finally, we used Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses (MCSA)
(39, 40) to quantify the uncertainty in observed risk esti-
mates due to the simultaneous operation of unmeasured
confounders, selection bias differential with respect to both
personality/SES and mortality, and systematic measurement
error in personality and SES. In the absence of external
information to validate the distributions of bias parameters,
MCSA results may best be interpreted as approximations of
the estimate uncertainty under different scenarios that might
hypothetically characterize the data-generating process.
Analyses were conducted in STATA, version 10 SE,
software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Descriptive data are presented in Table 1, with data for 25
specific personality traits presented in Web Table 3.
Adjusted for demographics, the 25th versus 75th percentile
of SES was associated with higher quintiles of neuroticism
(odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19,
1.45) and agreeableness (OR ¼ 1.24, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.36)
and with lower quintiles of extraversion (OR ¼ 0.91, 95%
CI: 0.83, 1.00), openness (OR ¼ 0.80, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.88),
and conscientiousness (OR ¼ 0.57, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.62).
Figure 2 depicts demographic-adjusted marginal probabili-
ties of membership in each big 5 quintile, across centiles
of SES.
Sequential models adjusting SES for personality factors
and vice versa are shown in Table 2. Unadjusted for person-
ality, the 25th versus 75th percentile of SES was associated
with a 43% increase in mortality risk. Unadjusted for SES,
the 75th versus 25th percentile of neuroticism was associ-
ated with a 38% increase in mortality risk. An interaction
was observed between agreeableness and conscientiousness.
At high (75th percentile) agreeableness, the odds ratio for
the 75th versus 25th percentile of conscientiousness was
0.63 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.84), while at low (25th percentile)
agreeableness it was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.35). The

interaction also suggested that agreeableness was associated
with elevated risk when conscientiousness was low (OR ¼
1.51, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.09) (Web Table 4).
Adjustment (model 4) revealed that personality attenu-
ated the SES odds ratio by 20%. Figure 3 depicts the move-
ment of the SES odds ratio observed during adjustment for
all 32 possible combinations of big 5 traits. The largest
attenuation appeared to be due to neuroticism and consci-
entiousness. By contrast, SES explained about 8% of the
risk associated with neuroticism and conscientiousness (at
high agreeableness) and 10% of the risk associated with
agreeableness (at low conscientiousness). Absolute risks
from model 4 for different configurations of SES and big
5 factors are shown in Figure 4. Persons of comparable SES
but different personality showed nontrivial differences in
absolute risk.
Health behaviors (model 5) explained roughly 59% of the
risk associated with SES, 26% of that for neuroticism, 9% of
that for conscientiousness (at high agreeableness), and 2%
of that for agreeableness (at low conscientiousness). When
random measurement error in health behaviors was
adjusted, the percentage of risk explained became 92%,
43%, 21%, and 6%, respectively.
Demographic-adjusted, population-attributable fractions
suggested that 15.9% of the population mortality was at-
tributable to low SES, 11% to high neuroticism, and 8.6%
to the combination of low agreeableness and conscien-
tiousness. Mutually adjusting SES and personality for one
another revealed population-attributable fractions of 13.3%
for low SES, 9.1% for high neuroticism, and 8.6% for
low agreeableness and conscientiousness. By comparison,
population-attributable fractions for health behaviors mutu-
ally adjusted for one another and for demographics were
13.3% for physical inactivity, 4.7% for obesity, and 20.5%
for current smoking.
Sensitivity analyses revealed regressor linearity in the
logit, no other reliable additive or multiplicative interac-
tions, and a very similar pattern of findings using multiple
imputation. One exception was that the SES effect was
about 10%­14% larger but, as before, personality explained
20% of this risk (Web Table 5). Stratification on gender
revealed that personality explained 21% of the SES risk in
men and 22% in women.
MCSA indicated that, across all possible combinations of
unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and systematic
measurement error, with bias parameter drawn from distri-
butions approximating other associations within the data
(Web Tables 6 and 7), log(relative risk) estimates differed
from those observed by a mean of 0.59 (standard deviation
(SD), 0.32) for neuroticism, 0.62 (SD, 0.37) for conscien-
tiousness, and 0.59 (SD, 0.32) for SES. On average, confi-
dence limit ratios around point estimates were roughly
4.5 times wider under the uncertainty entailed by these
supposed combinations of biases. Full MCSA findings are
presented in Web Table 8.
DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that the interface of personality,
SES, and all-cause mortality in the United States is best
characterized by some degree of correlated risk. Three

aspects of the current findings are worthy of note. First,
a recent study in France (9) reported that personality
explained 24%­36% of all-cause mortality risk for men
and 11% for women. That study used specific personality
factors from classic psychosomatic medicine (41, 42). In the
United States, using the more general big 5 personality
framework, we found that personality accounted for about
20% of the risk associated with lower SES, a number com-
parable across men and women. Thus, despite large differ-
ences in populations and personality measures, our results
suggest some generalizability of the correlated risk model.
Results from other studies on whether personality
accounts for some amount of the social gradients in health
outcomes vary. Personality constructs explain portions of
social gradients in smoking and activity levels (43, 44).
For obesity, some evidence suggests less confounding of
risk (45, 46). Still other evidence suggests risk clustering
for dispositional hostility and low SES with respect to allo-
static load (47) (i.e., systematic wear on cardiovascular,
neuroendocrine, and immune systems (48)). Our findings
are also consistent with previous evidence of associations
between personality and SES (11, 13, 19, 49, 50). We in-
terpret the associations observed between SES and person-
ality as the product of bidirectional influences over time,
consistent with life-course epidemiologic models of risk
clustering (51) and nature­nurture interplay (52).
The need to examine the public health impact of corre-
lated personality and SES risks has been raised (22). Of the
15.9% population mortality attributable to low SES, roughly
16% could be accounted for by the big 5. Of the 11%
attributable to high neuroticism, roughly 17% was attribut-
able to SES. With adjustment for this confounding, nontri-
vial proportions of mortality were still associated with both
low SES (13%) and personality (9.1% for high neuroticism,
8.9% for low agreeableness and conscientiousness). Thus,
social inequalities and dispositional risk would both appear
to be important distal etiologic factors in population
survival.
Additionally, the risk clustering that we observed was
modest, rather than total. Even after elimination of the con-
founding through adjustment, both personality and SES
conferred residual, independently additive risk. This sug-
gests that, despite the tendency for personality to explain
some portion of between-strata SES variability in mortality
risk, it also explains some portions of within-strata risk. In
other words, some persons are able to offset the risk of social
disadvantage through adaptive personality tendencies, some
persons negate the advantage of high SES through risky
dispositional tendencies, and others are duly advantaged or
disadvantaged with respect to SES and personality.
The second central finding concerns the role of specific
big 5 factors. The elevated mortality risk for persons higher
in neuroticism that we observed has been previously noted
(53­58). In addition, our findings indicated that conscien-
tiousness was protective at high levels of agreeableness.
This suggests that the health benefits of high conscientious-
ness may be most pronounced when people are also trusting
and invested in creating interpersonal harmony, rather than
cynical and prone to hostility. The self-disciplined, healthy
behavior characterizing high conscientiousness may be so-
cially reinforced or facilitated by the support of others that
arises from an amicable, rather than antagonistic, approach
to life. Such a personality style has been deemed ``effective
altruists'' (59) for its balance between personal accomplish-
ment and beneficence toward others. High agreeableness
conferred mortality risk at low conscientiousness. This big
5 combination is denoted as the ``well-intentioned'' style
and is characterized by the pursuit of interpersonal harmony
at the expense of one's own diligence with respect to daily
obligations and life goals (59). The quest for interpersonal
harmony in the absence of self-discipline may signal a yield-
ing to social pressures deleterious to health. Negative health
consequences arising from a care-giving burden (60) or
conflict-induced stress (61) may be particularly salient for
such persons. Elevated mortality risk for higher agreeable-
ness (independent of conscientiousness) has been observed
in prior work on childhood personality (62­64).
Third, health behaviors explained substantial portions of
the SES and neuroticism effects, consistent with prior re-
ports (2). However, even after correction for measurement
error, residual mortality risk was observed, particularly for
configurations of conscientiousness and agreeableness.
Cross-sectional, self-reported health behaviors may fail to
fully capture health behaviors or changes in them over time.
Remaining risk may also be a function of health behaviors
not examined here, such as substance abuse, behavior in-
viting injuries, and health-care utilization. Residual risk
may also signal the operation of biologic processes (65­
67) such as allostatic load. Gene­environment interaction
models (68) imply that personality phenotype may mark
genetic vulnerability (69, 70) to such processes.
Our findings have several implications. Methodologically,
risk estimates for low SES are likely to be overestimated
without adjustment for personality tendencies. At the same
time, absolute mortality risk for persons of lower SES may
be underestimated, because other dispositional risks may be
present and unaccounted for. At the level of prevention, our
findings suggest that public health messages aimed at per-
sons of lower SES may be additionally tailored and targeted
according to dispositional factors (71­73). The efficacy and
cost-effectiveness of clinical interventions with behavioral
components may be similarly improved by such tailoring
(74, 75). Personality research might inform initiatives to
mitigate underuse or overuse of health services among so-
cially disadvantaged individuals (76­78). Additionally, the
clustering of both social disadvantage and personality risk
for mortality suggests that evidence-based health policy
stress both social (79) and personal (80) responsibility for
health.
At a broader level, our results highlight the need to bet-
ter understand mechanisms of personality­SES correla-
tion. Such understanding can illuminate how and when to
intervene in mutually reinforcing risk chains between social
disadvantage and health-damaging personality tendencies.
Population prevention involves not only reducing this risk
clustering but also directly mitigating social disadvantage
and chronic emotional distress (neuroticism), while also
promoting prosocial self-discipline (conscientiousness and
agreeableness). Can population shifts in socioeconomic
structure and personality disposition occur? We believe that
Personality, Socioeconomic Status, and Mortality 89

such shifts are possible, but only over the long term. How-
ever, traditional public health targets of virtually eliminating
smoking and obesity in the population are similar long-term
goals.
Neuroticism declines, and agreeableness and conscien-
tiousness increase naturally over the life course (81), mean-
ing that, although personality is somewhat stable, most
people are not impervious to adaptive changes in basic dis-
position. Birth cohort (82) and cross-national differences
(83), as well as dispositional change during social upheaval
(84­87), also suggest that sociocultural factors influence per-
sonality. Numerous social programs already endeavor to
shape sociocultural factors. These include initiatives aimed
at SES directly: programs for job training, early and life-long
education, tax mechanisms for reducing the burden on the
poor, and initiatives seeking to employ or educate persons
from underprivileged backgrounds. Our findings raise the
possibility that such social programs may directly and/or
indirectly shape population disposition as well over the long
term. Yet, it is important to note that personality variation
will likely persist for evolutionary reasons (88), even if cen-
tral tendencies of trait distributions shift. Efforts to better
understand these complex issues appear warranted.
On the basis of a balanced assessment of study strengths
and limitations, we encourage interpretation of these find-
ings. We examined only all-cause mortality at 10 years and
refrain from speculation about the interface of SES and per-
sonality risks for cause-specific mortality. Our findings are
based on a US sample and the big 5 personality framework,
representing both significant extensions of prior work and
the limiting frame for generalization. We eagerly await fur-
ther reports from other populations. The mortality rate in the
Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) Study,
while consistent with lower mortality rates often observed in
mixed-age samples, also speaks to the need for future anal-
yses when deaths have accumulated in this cohort. Date-
of-death data would also permit time-to-event modeling.
Finally, our MCSA indicate that risk estimates are precisely
that--estimates based on available information, which
might vary under unknown combinations of unobserved
biases. We have no evidence supporting or dismissing the
magnitude, direction, or even the operation of such factors,
but we believe that the MCSA provide a useful reminder of
the uncertainty involved in statistical estimation.
Study strengths involved the first examination of which
we are aware of the contribution of personality to SES gra-
dients in US all-cause mortality, careful treatment of ran-
dom and systematic measurement error, analysis of missing
data patterns and bias, and quantification of a range of other
unobserved biases. The recency of this line of investigation
highlights the need for more study. Personality, SES, and
their interrelations have public health, clinical, and social
policy implications.
