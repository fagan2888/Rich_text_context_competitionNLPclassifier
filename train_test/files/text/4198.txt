Introduction
The current political attitude toward teachers is tenuous at
best. As states look for ways to balance their budgets and
increase accountability for student achievement, more
emphasis has been placed on teachers and schools to carry
the burden. Several states, including Wisconsin, Ohio, and
Massachusetts, have passed or introduced bills limiting col-
lective bargaining among teachers. States such as Tennessee,
Florida, Colorado, and Nevada have recently passed legisla-
tion that reforms the teacher tenure process. What was once
a stable and predictable career has become volatile and ten-
tative because of high-stakes measures, changing legislative
demands, and increased pressure to improve outcomes.
There is no doubt that teachers are enduring higher levels
of stress because of increased demands and pressure.
Occupational stress coupled with demands to improve stu-
dents' standardized test scores place teachers at risk for being
dissatisfied with their jobs. Teacher satisfaction is important
to study and consider for several reasons. Teaching has been
reported to be one of the most stressful jobs in the United
States (Dworkin, Haney, Dworkin, & Telschow, 1990;
Johnson, Cooper, Cartwright, Donald et al., 2005). Teachers
have a high rate of turnover, and new teachers are quitting at
alarming rates. Estimates suggest that 12% of all teachers
leave teaching every year, with only 25% of cases due to
teacher retirement (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2008;
Boe, Cook, & Sunderland, 2008; Ingersoll, 2002). In
high-poverty schools, as many as 20% of teachers leave every
year; some transfer to other schools while others leave the
classroom permanently (Ingersoll, 2002). Ingersoll (2002)
has called the high rate of teacher attrition among new teach-
ers, approximately one third in the first 3 years, a "revolving
door" and has linked this problem to teaching shortages that
exist in the United States (p. 23). Such turnover costs money
for districts and schools that already have constrained bud-
gets. Moreover, the overall level of satisfaction and attitudes
of teachers are related to school performance.
Schools with more satisfied teachers are more effective
(Ostroff, 1992). In addition, teachers heavily influence the
school community, morale among staff and students, and the
overall school climate. Teachers who experience high levels
of stress are more likely to miss days of work (Kyriacou,
1980), which could potentially lead to falling behind in the
curriculum. Teachers who are dissatisfied could negatively
affect the morale of their students and fellow teachers, which
could result in decreased motivation of students and staff
(Ostroff, 1992). Teachers who experience burnout, which
comes from prolonged periods of stress, not only suffer

The Role of School Environment inTeacher
Dissatisfaction Among U.S. Public School
Teachers
Cara M. Moore1
Abstract
This article discusses the relationship between the school environment and teacher dissatisfaction utilizing the 2007-
2008 School and Staffing Survey. The school environment is defined through a social-ecological perspective which takes
into account the hierarchical nature of schools. Teacher dissatisfaction was quantified through a composite of variables
that asked teachers about their overall feelings regarding the profession.A logistic regression was performed with teacher
dissatisfaction as the criterion variable, and school environment variables and teacher background variables as predictors.
School environment played a statistically significant role in the dissatisfaction of teachers. Specifically, teacher autonomy and
principal leadership decreased the odds of teacher dissatisfaction,while student and community problems increased the odds
of teacher dissatisfaction. Once school environment was taken into account, the log odds of teacher race, middle school
status, and rural school locale increased while remaining statistically significant.

physiologically but also become detached from their respon-
sibilities and roles (Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001).
Low morale, burnout, and detachment are likely to counter-
act efforts to raise student achievement.
The purpose of this study is to determine how the school
environment is related to teacher dissatisfaction. An ecologi-
cal perspective was used to define the environment where
teachers work (Bronfenbrenner, 1977). Schools are organized
within a system with many layers. Each layer, such as the
classroom, the school, the neighborhood and city where
the school is located, the school system, the state, and the
national government, contributes to the overall environment
where teachers experience some degree of satisfaction or
dissatisfaction.
Several features of school environments have been
directly tied to teacher dissatisfaction. For example, negative
school climate, poor administrative leadership, and the qual-
ity of the school building have each been associated with
increased rates of teacher dissatisfaction (Buckley, Schneider,
& Shang, 2005; Lee, Dedrick & Smith, 1991; Tye & O'Brien,
2002). In addition, the racial and economic composition of
the student body has also been shown to play a role in the
satisfaction of teachers (Litt & Turk, 1985; Zembylas &
Papanastasiou, 2006). The factors that contribute to teacher
discontent are important to understand due to increased
emphasis on education, the increasing demands on teachers,
and the current costs of replacing teachers.
The research question is as follows: To what degree do
school environmental factors and teacher background char-
acteristics explain teachers' discontent? This question was
answered through an empirical study which drew on data
from the School and Staffing Survey (SASS). The U.S.
Department of Education sponsors this surveys through the
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This large
scale survey regularly assess districts, principals, and teach-
ers based on their perceptions of issues pertinent to educa-
tion and consist of five types of questionnaires: district
questionnaires, principal questionnaires, school question-
naires, teacher questionnaires, and school library media center
questionnaires. Moreover, extensive background data on the
districts, schools, and teachers are collected. The public
school version of the SASS includes 38,240 public school
teachers representing all 50 states. The most recent iteration
of the teacher surveys measured teachers' education and
training, teaching assignment, certification, workload, pro-
fessional development, perceptions about teaching, income,
and many other factors related to teaching and schools. Both
public and private schools are included in that national sur-
vey; only the public teacher portion of the survey was
analyzed.
School Environment
The school environment was defined by using social-ecological
theory as a guide. Social-ecological theory was described in its
most popular form by Urie Bronfenbrenner (1977) and
emphasizes the complex environmental system where peo-
ple live and operate. In essence, social-ecological theory is a
systems approach that carefully defines the multilayered envi-
ronment in which individual actions occur. To emphasize the
complex and dynamic nature of the environment where peo-
ple live and work, Bronfenbrenner depicts the environment
through four unique subsystems, each one nested within the
other. This approach allows for interactions between the
individual and each subsystem and for interactions between
subsystems to be studied (Harney, 2007). Social-ecological
theory is a useful tool for the study of schools because of the
complex hierarchy in which schools exist.
Bronfenbrenner's social-ecological theory has been applied
to the study of teachers in previous research studies, specifi-
cally studies of special education teachers by Miller,
Brownell, and Smith (1999). The adaptation used in this
study is slightly different from that used by Miller et al. In
adapting Bronfenbrenner's theory to the study of teacher dis-
satisfaction, the unit of analysis is the teacher. The four sub-
systems are defined as follows: the microsystem is the
immediate classroom where the teacher works and carries
out the majority of his or her activities; the mesosystem is the
school where the teacher works; the exosystem is the larger
school district and community where the teacher operates,
lives, and interacts with others; and the macrosystem includes
the larger structure of schooling, the various laws and stat-
utes that regulate schools, and aspects of American culture.
All four subsystems combine to form the ecological school
system. Each subsystem of the ecological school system
allows for identification of factors that could affect teacher
attrition and satisfaction.
This systems approach defines the different components
that make up a school's environment. To study teachers
effectively, the complex environment in which they work
must be taken into consideration and carefully analyzed.
Moreover, because teacher dissatisfaction is a complex phe-
nomena with a myriad of causes, each subsystem should be
considered carefully for its particular influence, be it directly
or indirectly through another source, such as teacher stress,
burnout, or teacher efficacy.
The next section will provide a review of the literature as
it relates to factors shown to cause teacher dissatisfaction. In
addition, social-ecological theory will be discussed as a tool
to describe the school environment, which will be examined
as a contributor to teacher dissatisfaction.
Review of Literature
Several different factors have been shown to influence
teacher satisfaction. Liu and Ramsey (2008) examined the
2000/2001 version of the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS)
to determine teachers' satisfaction with different aspects of
their jobs. It was found that race and years of teaching expe-
rience were related to job satisfaction among teachers.
Moore 3
Specifically, minority teachers were less satisfied with
teaching, and teachers with more years of experience were
more satisfied with teaching. Moreover, Liu and Ramsey
found female teachers were more satisfied than male teach-
ers. This gender difference has been confirmed by several
other studies (Bogler, 2001; Chapman & Lowther, 1982;
Menon, Papanastasiou, & Zembylas, 2008). This study will
determine if Liu and Ramsey's findings have been main-
tained over the past 8 to 9 years or whether they have
changed post No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).
Green-Reese, Johnson, and Campbell (1991) conducted a
study with 229 physical education teachers in urban schools
to determine how age, teaching experience, and school size
were related to job satisfaction and stress. It was found that
job satisfaction is severely affected by job stress. However,
age and years of teaching were not significantly related to
job satisfaction. This finding contradicts Liu and Ramsey's
(2008) study, which found the years of teaching experience
was significantly related to job satisfaction. The authors
noted the discrepancy between their results and those of pre-
vious studies and determined that subgroups of teachers
should be examined in future studies rather than all teachers.
This article will serve to clarify the role of gender in teacher
job satisfaction and will also examine various subgroups of
teachers.
The literature suggests that teachers' perceptions about
their schools and administrators are related to their satisfac-
tion. Kreis and Brockopp (1986) conducted a study with 60
public school teachers in the state of New York to determine
the relationship between three dimensions of job autonomy
and job satisfaction. The three dimensions were (a) teachers'
perceived autonomy within the classroom, (b) autonomy
outside the classroom but within the school, and (c) an over-
all sense of autonomy. Perception of autonomy within the
classroom was significantly related to job satisfaction, but
no other perceptions of autonomy were significantly associ-
ated. Thus, teachers' ability to control their own classrooms
was found to be important for teachers to be satisfied with
their jobs.
Similarly, Pearson and Moomaw (2005) conducted a
quantitative study with 171 Florida teachers to determine the
relationship between teacher autonomy and four other con-
structs: job stress, work satisfaction, empowerment, and pro-
fessionalism. Teacher autonomy was separated into two
dimensions, curriculum autonomy and general teaching
autonomy. Correlations revealed curriculum autonomy was
significantly and negatively related to job stress; moreover,
general teaching autonomy was significantly and positively
associated with empowerment and professionalism. Quaglia,
Marion, and McIntire (1991) conducted a study with 477
teachers from 20 rural Maine communities to determine dif-
ferences between satisfied and dissatisfied teachers regard-
ing their perceptions of school organization, empowerment,
status, and attitude toward students. The researchers
found that satisfied teachers experienced significantly more
empowerment within their schools than dissatisfied teachers;
the differences found in empowerment were greater than any
other factors examined. This study expands on the studies
cited above by examining the role of teacher autonomy with
a national sample of teachers.
Rebora (2009) reviewed a series of Met Life surveys on
the teaching profession to determine changes in teacher sat-
isfaction over time. It was found that overall satisfaction
with teaching has risen from 1984 to 2008. When asked
about negative aspects of teaching, twice as many teachers
said the number of Limited English Proficiency (LEP) stu-
dents they teach hinders student learning (11% in 1984 to
22% in 2008) and 43% of teachers said students' varied
learning abilities challenge their ability to effectively teach.
Furthermore, 50% of teachers reported poverty as a problem.
Positive findings from the review include the following: two
thirds of teachers said they were well prepared for the pro-
fession and more teachers report that resources are available
to them. Moreover, the percentage of teachers who were sat-
isfied with their salary increased from 40% in 1984 to 62%
in 2008. This study will examine how classroom composi-
tion such as percentage of students with special needs, per-
centage of students who are learning English, and percentage
of minority students affect teacher satisfaction.
Schoolwide factors and variables have also been shown to
affect teacher dissatisfaction. Kearney (2008) found that among
teachers sampled from a midwestern school district, less than
half were satisfied with class size, support from parents, school
learning environment, and availability of resources. These fac-
tors were also cited as causes of teacher attrition. Retention
rates (3 years in the classroom) were between 74.77% and
89.1% for White teachers and between 76.5% and 94.1% for
Black teachers during a 5-year time span.
Culver, Wolfle, and Cross (1990) surveyed public school
teachers in Virginia and determined that school climate and
commitment to teaching were significant factors in explain-
ing job satisfaction. School climate included factors such as
poverty status, race of students, and available resources. It
was found that teaching experience and other teacher back-
ground factors such as race and sex had little effect. Culver
et al.'s study also supports findings by Kearney (2008) that
school resources and learning environment are significant
factors for teachers in regards to job satisfaction.
Menon, Papanastasiou, & Zembylas (2008) conducted a
study among schoolteachers in Cypress to determine the
relationship between teacher variables, organizational vari-
ables, and job satisfaction. The researchers sampled more
than 450 teachers in a quantitative study using surveys. The
major findings were lower school levels (i.e., primary
schools) were associated with increased job satisfaction;
teachers in primary schools were more satisfied than teach-
ers in secondary schools. Other findings suggested that
increased job satisfaction is related to school climate and
professional goal attainment. An examination of sources of
satisfaction and dissatisfaction of teachers in Cypress by
4 SAGE Open
Zembylas and Papanastasiou (2006) suggested primary
sources of satisfaction for teachers were working with chil-
dren, contributing to society, collaborative work with col-
leagues, professional growth, salary, and work schedule. In
contrast, primary sources of dissatisfaction were social prob-
lems, student failure, lack of discipline, lack of respect and
status in community, and lack of autonomy.
Rhodes, Nevill, and Allan (2004) examined 368 teachers
in primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom.
The researchers aimed to identify factors that were dissatis-
fying for teachers in an effort to increase teacher retention.
The findings suggested the most dissatisfying components of
teaching were workload, balance between work and home,
administrative tasks, society's views of teachers, and pupil
behavior issues. The most satisfying features of teaching
were friendliness of staff, classroom atmosphere, climate of
achievement, and recognition of efforts by leadership.
Crossman and Harris (2006) conducted a quantitative study
on schoolteachers in Surry, England, to examine how the type
of school affects the satisfaction of secondary school teachers.
It was found that teacher satisfaction varied by type of school.
Specifically, independent and privately managed schools had
more satisfied teachers, whereas foundation schools and
Anglican schools had less satisfied teachers. The authors noted
that possible causes for the results were differences in resources
available, differences in oversight, differences in academic
control, and differences in community status.
The aforementioned studies examined the relationship
between schoolwide factors and teacher dissatisfaction but
showed very similar results. However, many of the samples
were either from teachers outside of the United States or
were limited to a single state. This study seeks to determine
the role school climate plays in the job satisfaction of public
school teachers in the United States. Furthermore, in this
study, school climate will be considered a part of the overall
school environment. This study will add to the literature on
job satisfaction by looking at schoolwide factors on a national
basis. The United States is an important context because of
unique national foci, such as federal laws and the increasing
stakes of standardized testing.
Overall, the review of literature reveals that several con-
structs and variables should be included as potential predic-
tors of teacher dissatisfaction. Specifically, constructs such
as teacher efficacy, school climate, and teacher autonomy
should be included. Other variables such as classroom man-
agement, principal support, highest degree earned, and certifi-
cation status should also be considered as potential predictors
as they have been shown to affect teacher satisfaction.
Method
The data were drawn from a survey conducted on a national
scope by the NCES and the SASS. The SASS was developed
in the mid-1980s after a review was completed on several
surveys that were administered to teachers separately. The
SASS was created to combine the data collected from teach-
ers and school personnel on those surveys with additional
information on teacher demand, school conditions, and per-
ceptions of school climate and problems in schools. There are
four different components to the SASS: the School
Questionnaire, the Teacher Questionnaire, the Principal
Questionnaire, and the School District Questionnaire. This
study used data from the public school version of the
Teacher Questionnaire (NCES, 2010). This version was
selected because it included teachers in public and charter
schools from kindergarten through 12th grade. Moreover,
the data from the survey include information about the
schools in which the teachers work, which is also of impor-
tance to the researcher.
The SASS is a powerful data set not only because of its
breadth and large sample size but also because it allows
researchers to conduct a wide variety of analyses. Researchers
can compare data across sectors, such as private, public, and
charter schools; analyze data at the state level; compare sub-
groups of respondents; analyze change over time; and link to
other data sources (NCES, 2010). For these reasons, this data
set is particularly suitable for the current study. The teacher
version of the SASS provides data on both the teachers and
the schools in which the teachers work. Both levels of data are
important because they correspond to the two subsystems that
are central to the study--the microsystem and mesosystem.
Although different versions of the survey, such as the district
version, provide data at higher levels, those surveys will not
be used for this study.Additional information about the SASS
is available online at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/
The Sample
One of the positive aspects of the SASS is its large scope and
sample size. It is the largest teacher survey conducted in the
United States (National Center for Educational Statistics,
2010). Table 1 shows the unweighted sample sizes for dis-
tricts, teachers, and schools that completed the SASS.
According to the table, more than 38,000 teachers were
sampled from about 6,800 schools in more than 3,900 school
districts. It is important to note that not all of these teachers
are regular, full-time teachers. Thus, the researcher removed
any teachers who were not classified as full-time or regular
teachers from the sample prior to data analysis leaving 34,870
teachers in the sample. The sampling strategy by the NCES
was such that districts were identified first, then schools, and
then teachers within schools.
There are some challenges to using a large secondary data
set. With this particular data set, one challenge is the nested
structure of the data, specifically teachers within schools,
within districts. There is the possibility that schools within
districts are similar to each other because of commonalities
in governance, central administration, and procedures.
Moore 5
Moreover, teachers within schools can be similar to each
other because of the common administration, procedures, and
norms within each school. This potential for error was
addressed by calculating the intraclass correlation (ICC) and
then using that value to calculate the design effect. The nor-
malized sample weight was then divided by the design effect
to reduce the sample size. (For more information on design
effects see Johnson & Elliott, 1998.) Other limitations
include potential errors with data entry and the inability to
compare the actual surveys with the codebook. Nevertheless,
the benefits of using the SASS outweigh the limitations for
the purpose of this study.
Variables in the Study
The first phase involved an analysis of the survey items by
the researcher to determine which items corresponded to
constructs relevant to the research question. Items were con-
strued using the concept model based on Bronfenbrenner's
theory of ecological systems. Survey items that related to the
school environment were identified by careful analysis of the
survey and cross-referencing survey items to the literature.
The survey items were then factor analyzed to build con-
structs, such as teacher control, job satisfaction, student prob-
lems, and community problems. The second phase involved
using the constructs identified in Phase 1 to statistically
determine which ones predicted teacher job dissatisfaction.
Using the review of literature, the researcher reviewed the
survey items and cross-referenced them to previously
reported causes of discontent among teachers. Variables that
might be relevant to dissatisfaction but were not previously
researched in the literature, such as highly qualified teacher
status and union membership, were also included.
Appendix A lists the continuous variables identified for
use in this study. The sample sizes, means, and standard
deviations for each variable are provided. Teacher charac-
teristics include age, years of teaching experience, and sal-
ary. According to the data, the mean age for teachers in the
sample is 42.77 years and the mean number of teaching years
is 13.82. Some variables were used to limit the sample, such
as main assignment and full-time status, while the remaining
variables were used to explore teacher dissatisfaction.
School context variables include student/teacher ratio, the
percentages of minority teachers and students, the percentage
of students taught with Individual Educational Programs
(IEPs), and the percentage of students taught with LEP.
Similar to the teacher perception and background variables,
school context variables were explored as possible predictors
of attrition and teacher dissatisfaction. Many of the variables
considered as important for the study were categorical in
nature.
Appendix B provides unweighted descriptives for con-
tinuous variables in the study. Some expected and unex-
pected findings were revealed. First, the frequencies reveal
68.9% of the teachers in the sample are female whereas
31.1% of the teachers are male. Moreover, 90.1% of the
teachers are White whereas 6.1% are Black and 1.6% are
Asian. These findings are consistent with previously reported
statistics regarding the teacher workforce (Ingersoll, 2002).
The table also reveals 91.2% of the teachers in the sample
are full-time, regular teachers. This finding is important as
the study will exclude teachers who are not full-time regular
teachers. Interesting to note is that 17.9% of the teachers in
the sample have 3 years or less of total teaching experience,
87.6% of sampled teachers are highly qualified as defined by
the state where they work, and 88.1% of teachers have stan-
dard or advanced certificates.
Teacher Dissatisfaction CompositeVariable
A series of ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions
were planned to determine predictors of dissatisfaction
among teachers. An analysis of the skewness and kurtosis of
the dissatisfaction composite variable revealed that it was
not normally distributed (skew/SE skew = 57.03). Typically
values greater than 1.96 are considered problematic for
OLS. In lieu of an OLS regression, a logistic regression was
performed because it does not require normality of criterion
variables and is more robust.
To conduct a logistic regression, the dissatisfaction com-
posite variable needed to be dichotomized, that is, changed
from a range of numbers to two values that correspond to
"yes" and "no." First, the variable was recoded as a categori-
cal variable with five categories. A frequency was run to
determine the range of values for the variable. Then the val-
ues were recoded so that all values between 0 and 1 were
coded as 0, values between 1 and 2 were coded as 1, values
between 2 and 3 were coded as 2, values between 3 and 4
were coded as 3, and values of 4 or greater were coded as 4.
A value of 0 corresponded to low dissatisfaction (being
highly satisfied) and a value of 4 corresponded to being
highly dissatisfied. A second frequency was run on the cate-
gorized variable to check for accuracy. Unweighted and nor-
malized weighted frequency data for categorized teacher
dissatisfaction are listed in Table 2.
Because of the potential for overestimation of teacher dis-
satisfaction, only the most extreme cases of dissatisfaction
were considered for the dichotomous variable, values 3 and 4.

Thus, the categorical variable was dichotomized with val-
ues 0, 1, and 2 recoded to 0 (not dissatisfied) and values
3 and 4 recoded to 1 (dissatisfied) seeTable 3.The dichotomized
variable, therefore, is a conservative measure of teacher dis-
satisfaction; moderately dissatisfied teachers were not
included to address potential error.
Combining the unweighted percentages of the cases with
values 3 and 4 gives a total of 15.5% of cases that are mod-
erately or very dissatisfied with their jobs. It is sufficient to
run a logistic regression with 15.5% of the sample as the
criterion variable without additional problems. Moreover,
because logistic regressions do not rely on normality of vari-
ables, the nonnormality of the predictor variables becomes a
nonissue.
The procedures used to analyze the data included the
identification of relevant survey items and statistical proce-
dures to group them into constructs that corresponded to dif-
ferent school environment variables. The school environment
variables, along with teacher background and school context
variables were regressed with teacher dissatisfaction as the
criterion variable. The next section describes the results of
the factor analysis and logistic regression in detail.
Results
Phase 1 of the study involved a factor analysis to assist in the
construction of teacher dissatisfaction along with school
environment variables that would be used to predict teacher
dissatisfaction. The public teacher version of the SASS was
used to obtain data used for the analysis. This survey is
developed by the NCES and administered by the U.S.
Census Bureau.
The SASS sample was limited to full-time, regular teach-
ers reducing the sample size from 38,240 to 34,870. All other
teachers, including part-time and substitute teachers, were
excluded from the sample. The revised sample included
teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade from all
subject areas. Special education teachers and specialists,
such as art, physical education, and music teachers, were
also included.
The first analysis was a principal components factor
analysis with varimax rotation; it was completed to reveal
factors that would be used to construct school environ-
ment variables. The school environment was defined using
teacher perceptions of their students, classrooms, schools,
and principals as measured by the survey. Only items that
described the teaching environment were included; teacher
background and school background variables were omit-
ted from the factor analysis. The results are listed in
Appendix C.
The exploratory factor analysis revealed potential com-
posite variables to be examined for the study. The categories
were identified by looking at similarities between the items
that loaded at .400 or higher. This value coefficient cutoff is
modest and is frequently used to eliminate variables in
exploratory factor analyses. Variables with value coefficients
greater than .400 in more than one category were categorized
by factor score; the variable was placed in the category with
the greater value coefficient.
All categories were then analyzed for reliability using
Cronbach's alpha to ensure accuracy of the variable place-
ment and the consistency of the overall constructs. Cronbach's
alpha was computed for each category, and variables that
greatly lowered the overall reliability were eliminated.
Reliability data are reported in Table 4.
Variable Construction Using Exploratory
Factor Analysis
The five variables which were constructed from this analysis
and modeled as covariates in the multivariate analysis were:
(a) teacher perceptions of administrative and colleague sup-
port, (b) teacher perceptions of school problems, (c) teacher
perceptions of community problems (includes parents), (d)
teacher dissatisfaction, and (e) teacher control in the class-
room. These items respond to the school environment as
defined in the study. Many of the items that were used to
construct the composite variables were reverse coded or
recoded to allow for interpretation of the analysis. This pro-
cedure is similar to that used by Renzulli, Macpherson-
Parrott, and Beattie (2011).
The teacher dissatisfaction composite variable required
recoding of item categories so that the composite measured
dissatisfaction rather than satisfaction. Five variables were
reverse coded so that "strongly agree" was changed from a

score of 1 to 4 and "strongly disagree" was changed from a
score of 4 to 1. Those items were "teaching not worth it,"
"would leave for better pay," "would transfer to another
school," "less enthusiasm for teaching," and "too tired for
school." Moreover, the "remaining in teaching" variable
contained several responses that were similar in nature and
could be combined. The variable was recoded so that those
similar responses (i.e., until I am eligible for retirement, until
I am eligible for social security) had the same score. In addi-
tion, responses of "uncertain" were omitted. This recoding
procedure is similar to that used by Renzulli et al. (2011).
A logistic regression with teacher dissatisfaction as the
criterion variable was run in a series of models to control for
teacher background and school context variables. The
dichotomized form of the variable was used. A design effect
adjusted weight was applied to the sample to correct the
sample size for the interclass correlation, which was .023.
Interclass correlation was a potential source of error in this
analysis because teachers were sampled based on the schools
in which they worked. Sampled members of the same group
(in this case school) present the potential that the group
members will answer survey questions similarly. The
8 SAGE Open
interclass correlation measures the association of the
responses given by members of the same group for a par-
ticular variable. High correlations are problematic and need
to be addressed. The design effect reduced the sample size
for this analysis from 34,870 to an effective size of 32,310
teachers. Results of the logistic regression are provided in
Table 5.
The results of logistic regressions are provided as a log
odds ratio () of the event occurring. They are typically con-
verted to exp(B)s by raising e to the power of the log odds.
Exp(B) values give the change in odds for a one unit change in
the predictor variable. For dichotomous variables, a one-unit
change corresponds to group membership. The formula
[exp(B) ­ 1] × 100% is used to change the exp(B) values to
percentages that are easier to interpret. Moreover, probability
can be calculated from exp(B) with the following formula:
probability = odds / (1 + odds). For example, the log odds ratio
of female teachers being dissatisfied is 0.072. Raising e to the
power of 0.072 gives an odds ratio of 1.074. Thus, the odds of
female teachers being dissatisfied are 1.074 times greater than
male teachers. The percentage of increase in the odds can be
calculated by (1.074 ­ 1) × 100% = 7.4%. Thus, the odds of
female teachers being dissatisfied are 7.4% greater than male
teachers. (See DeMaris, 1995, for additional information about
logistic regression.)All results discussed are based on the third
model of the regression unless otherwise noted.
The results of the logistic regression indicate that teacher
background, school context, and school environment signifi-
cantly change the odds of dissatisfaction among teachers.
Among teacher background predictors, being Black signifi-
cantly increased the odds of being dissatisfied, exp(B) =
1.286, p < .001.1 Additional calculations reveal Black teach-
ers have a 28% increase in the odds of being dissatisfied
compared with non-Black teachers; the probability of a
Black teacher being dissatisfied is 56.2%.
Other teacher background variables significantly
decreased the odds of being dissatisfied. Total years of teach-
ing experience, union membership, new teacher status,
higher salary, and highly qualified teacher status all signifi-
cantly decreased the odds of teacher dissatisfaction. New
teacher status had a very large effect on dissatisfaction odds;
being a new teacher (first 3 years of teaching) decreased the
odds of teacher dissatisfaction by 34.6%, exp(B) = 0.654,
p < .001. Union membership decreased the odds of a teacher
being dissatisfied by 27.3%, exp(B) = 0.727, p < .001, and
highly qualified teacher status decreased the odds of teacher
dissatisfaction by 12.8%, exp(B) = 0.872, p < .05. Total years
of teaching experience had a modest, yet significant effect on
dissatisfaction with each additional year of teaching experi-
ence lowering the odds of dissatisfaction by 2%, exp(B) =
0.980, p < .001. An increase in school salary by US$1,000
resulted in a decrease in the odds of dissatisfaction by 1.6%,
exp(B) = 0.984, p < .001.
School context variables also significantly contributed to
teacher dissatisfaction. Most significant predictors relevant
to school background increased the odds of teacher dissatis-
faction. Teaching in a middle school significantly increased
the odds of teacher dissatisfaction by 31.8%, exp(B) = 1.318,
p < .001. In addition, teaching in a rural school increased the
odds of dissatisfaction by 12%, exp(B) = 1.120, p < .05.
Larger student­teacher ratios, larger percentages of minority
teachers in a school, and larger percentages of LEP2 students
each increased the odds of teacher dissatisfaction although
the changes in odds were small. A unit increase in student/
teacher ratio, that is the addition of one student in a class-
room, increased the odds of dissatisfaction by 1.9%. A
single-point increase in the percentage of minority teachers
and a percentage increase in number of LEP students both
increased the odds of dissatisfaction by 0.3%, exp(B) =
1.003, p < .001; exp(B) = 1.003, p < .01. The percentage of
students enrolled in the National School Lunch Program
(NSLP) was the only school background predictor that sig-
nificantly decreased the odds of teacher dissatisfaction,
although the effect was small. A single-point increase in the
percentage of students enrolled in NSLP resulted in a 0.3%
decrease in the odds of teacher dissatisfaction, exp(B) =
0.997, p < .01.
School environment predictors also played a significant
role in the dissatisfaction of teachers. Both teacher percep-
tions of school problems and community problems signifi-
cantly increased dissatisfaction among teachers; an increase
in the perception of school problems (e.g., from no problems
to minor problems) predicted a 17.1% increase in dissatis-
faction, exp(B) = 1.171, p <.001, and an increase in the per-
ception of community problems predicted a 19.8% increase
in dissatisfaction, exp(B) = 1.198, p < .001. Teacher control
in the classroom and administrative and colleague support
significantly decreased the odds of teacher dissatisfaction.
An increase in teacher perceptions of support from adminis-
trators and colleagues (e.g. from strongly disagree to some-
what disagree) corresponded to a 65.4% decrease in the odds
of being dissatisfied, exp(B) = .346, p < .001, and an increase
in teacher control (e.g. from no control to minor control) of
the classroom decreased the odds of dissatisfaction by
30.9%, exp(B) = .691, p < .001.
Based on the above data, a model can be constructed to
describe the relationship between teacher background,
school context, and school environment. The model can be
represented as a formula using the constant and the regres-
sion coefficients. Putting data for a particular teacher into the
formula will yield the logit of the probability of that teacher
being dissatisfied. The logit of the probability is equivalent
to the natural log of the odds of the event occurring. The
standard logistic regression formula takes the form:

dissatisfaction includes 16 predictor variables and the con-

the regression coefficient. In the event the value is zero, that

Discussion
It is important to note most teachers surveyed were satisfied
to a high or moderate degree. About 15.5% of teachers in the
sample were moderately or very dissatisfied. This finding
supports the studies that suggest that most teachers are satis-
fied with their jobs (Kyriacou & Sutcliffe, 1979; Quaglia et al.,
1991; Rebora, 2009). This finding is important because
many studies that examine teacher dissatisfaction fail to
mention the overall satisfaction and dissatisfaction rates of
teachers. Moreover, this finding suggests that the positive
aspects of teaching, such as helping students and community
involvement, outweigh the negative aspects of the job.
Nevertheless, there are aspects of teaching that can increase
10 SAGE Open
dissatisfaction. Discussion of the salient factors that negatively
affect teacher job satisfaction are discussed below.
School Environment
In consideration of the factors that contribute to dissatisfac-
tion, the results suggest that school environment plays a
crucial role in the experience of dissatisfaction among public
school teachers. When school environment is considered,
the study suggests that positive environment and teacher
control decrease teacher dissatisfaction; thus teachers who
perceive a more positive environment and have more control
over their classrooms are more satisfied with their jobs. The
study further suggests that teachers' perceptions of student
problems and teachers' perceptions of community problems
increase teacher dissatisfaction.
A reexamination of the composition of the school envi-
ronment variables clarifies the findings further. A positive
school environment comprised the following components:
a supportive administration, enforcement of rules by the
principal and other teachers, shared beliefs and values,
communication among the principal and staff, cooperation
among staff, recognition of achievement and hard work by
the principal, general overall satisfaction, general satisfac-
tion with salary, and the belief that the school is well run.
Based on the composition of the positive school environ-
ment variable, having a positive school environment is
heavily dependent on the administration and other staff
members. Having a school leader who communicates with
staff members and sets the tone for cooperation, and a
shared sense of purpose is critical to teachers' perception of
a positive school environment and being satisfied with their
jobs (Bogler, 2001).
Teacher control is another aspect of the school environ-
ment that affects teacher dissatisfaction. The teacher control
variable in this study comprised control over teaching prac-
tices, control over grading, control over discipline, and con-
trol over homework. These four components typically occur
within a teachers' classroom and correspond with the micro-
system of the teachers' school environment. Thus, control
and autonomy over classroom decisions are very important
for teachers to be satisfied with their jobs. Again, the admin-
istration determines how much autonomy and control teach-
ers have over the affairs of their classroom. This study
suggests that more control helps teachers to be satisfied with
their jobs.
Teachers' perceptions of the problems students have
within their school and classroom affect teacher dissatisfac-
tion; the more problems that are perceived by teachers, the
more dissatisfied they are with their jobs. The perceptions
of student problems variable includes student tardiness, stu-
dents who are absent frequently, class cutting, student drop-
outs, and student apathy. It is important to note that the
teachers' thoughts about these issues were important for
dissatisfaction; the actual numerical rates of students' drop-
out, absence, tardiness, and so on were not. Thus, if teach-
ers' perceptions of student problems were to improve, then
their job satisfaction could also improve. This finding is
very important because teachers' perceptions may be easier
to change than students' actual behaviors, which are often-
times out of their control and affected by extraneous
circumstances.
Teachers' perceptions of community problems also
affected their job satisfaction. When teachers perceived
more problems with the community in which they worked,
they were more likely to be dissatisfied. The variable
included teachers' perceptions about parental involvement,
poverty, student preparation, and student health. As teach-
ers perceive lower levels of parental involvement, student
preparation, and student health and higher levels of pov-
erty, they are more likely to be dissatisfied with teaching.
Parental involvement and poverty have been widely stud-
ied as factors that are important for teachers, students, and
schools, especially in terms of student achievement (Hoover-
Dempsey & Sandler, 1995; White, 1982). Student health
and student preparation have been studied mostly in terms
of student achievement but have not been widely studied as
factors that affect teachers. It is very possible that these
factors cause decreases in teacher satisfaction due to their
roles in student achievement. Teachers are increasingly
assessed in regard to how well their students perform (see,
for example, McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz & Hamilton,
2004). Nevertheless, this conjecture is outside of the scope
of the research conducted in this project and requires fur-
ther study.
One of the strengths of Brofenbrenner's theory is that the
system levels are not self-contained; rather there is interac-
tion between system levels. This research study makes it
clear that the different system levels do interact with each
other; specifically, school environment serves to mediate the
effects of variables in other levels of the system. Recall that
three out of the four school environment variables are located
within the mesosystem. One school environment variable,
teacher control, is located within the microsystem.
Teacher Background
In examination of teachers' personal characteristics, ethnic-
ity played a role in the dissatisfaction of teachers. Before
school environment was added to the model, Hispanic
teachers were more likely to be dissatisfied. However, once
school environment was added to the model, the effect
ceased to exist. This result suggests that the issues that cause
Hispanic teachers to experience dissatisfaction with their
jobs have more to do with the school environment than
common experiences based on their ethnicity. Again, posi-
tive school environment and classroom control increased
teachers' levels of satisfaction; both of these variables relied
Moore 11
heavily on school leadership and administrative decisions.
Thus, it is possible that school administration efforts can
prevent Hispanic teachers from becoming dissatisfied with
their jobs.
Similarly, when race was examined, Black teachers
were highly dissatisfied with their jobs before school envi-
ronment was added to the model. After school environ-
ment was added, the effect decreased, but race still
remained significant. This result was not the case with
Hispanic teachers. This finding indicates that even if the
school environment was ideal, there is still a large chance
that Black teachers will be dissatisfied with their jobs. This
finding is perplexing and is worthy of additional study,
especially because the effect cannot be explained by school
background or school environment. It is unknown whether
the dissatisfaction of Black teachers is a new phenomenon
or whether Black teachers' have been dissatisfied with
teaching as a profession over a long period of time. Further
study is warranted to examine this finding and to determine
what underlying factors could cause higher levels of dis-
satisfaction among Black teachers. As there is an increased
effort to recruit and retain Black teachers, it is very impor-
tant to understand their common experiences within the
system of education.
School environment did not mitigate union membership,
new teacher status, or highly qualified teacher status. Thus,
these school context variables are important for teachers,
even if their environments are perceived as ideal. Each of
these three variables raised the odds of teacher satisfaction,
even in schools where teachers perceived negative student
behaviors and negative community factors, such as poverty.
Because many states are making changes to the functions of
unions, it is important to monitor how teacher satisfaction
changes in areas where unions are being challenged.
Microsystem
Recall that the microsystem is defined as the teachers'
classroom. Examination of the microsystem in light of the
school environment reveals that the student­teacher ratio
remains an important component of teacher dissatisfaction,
even when the school environment is taken into account. In
fact, the importance of the student­teacher ratio actually
increased once school environment was added to the model.
As school budgets decrease and the numbers of students
increase, it is critical that school districts continue to invest
in efforts that will keep class sizes from becoming too large.
Perhaps smaller class sizes allow teachers to work with
students who show problematic behaviors or students with
community challenges such as poverty and underprepared-
ness more effectively; this idea will need to be explored
through further study. Nevertheless, smaller class sizes help
teachers to be more satisfied with their jobs and smaller
class sizes have also been shown to positively affect student
achievement (Stecher, Bohrnstedt, Kirst, McRobbie, &
Williams, 2001).
Another interesting interaction between the school envi-
ronment and the microsystem is the effect of the percentage
of minority students on teacher dissatisfaction. When the
model included only teacher background and school back-
ground, the percentage of minority students slightly increased
teacher dissatisfaction. However, once school environment
was added to the model, the percentage of minority students
became nonsignificant to the satisfaction of teachers. This
indicates that the actual race of the students taught is not as
important as teachers' perceptions about the students they
teach.All school environment variables were based on teach-
ers' perceptions. Although the effects were small, this finding
indicates that helping teachers to perceive minority students
differently could increase their satisfaction with teaching large
numbers of minority students.
Conversely, the percentage of LEP students taught
became more important once school environment was fac-
tored into the model. Although the effect is small, the find-
ing is interesting and worthy of additional study. A
communication barrier between linguistically diverse stu-
dents and teachers could be related to this finding. Moreover,
teachers may not have the resources or training to effec-
tively teach LEP students. The School environment did not
capture the resources that a school had or training that the
teacher might have received. In addition, the data did not
include the types of programs that were offered in schools
to support LEP students and teachers of these students,
such as dual-language programs. It is possible that more
training, more resources, or specific types of bilingual pro-
grams could help teachers to work more effectively with
these students. Thus, more research is needed to examine
the interactions between linguistically diverse students and
general education teachers.
Mesosystem
The mesosystem was defined as the school and immediate
community where teachers work. Within the mesosystem,
urban school locale decreased in importance and became
nonsignificant once school environment was added to the
model. Conversely, middle school designation and rural
school locale increased in importance when school environ-
ment was added to the model. When considering urban and
rural schools, the results of the study suggest that differences
in teachers' perceptions of school environment better explain
why urban schools cause dissatisfaction among teachers.
Urban schools typically have challenges such as student pov-
erty, funding concerns, and large percentages of minority
students. This study suggests that teachers' perceptions about
such challenges are more important than the actual school
being designated as "urban." This difference is important to
note because many studies include urban school location as a
12 SAGE Open
variable when studying teacher dissatisfaction and other con-
structs such as teacher stress. Future studies should carefully
examine teachers'attitudes about their school environment as
well as locale to ensure accurate results.
Rural schools, however, do have a quality that contrib-
utes to teacher dissatisfaction that cannot be attributed to
the school environment. This finding indicates that more
study is needed to determine what factors cause rural teach-
ers to be more dissatisfied with their jobs. Similarly, middle
school designation also increased in importance once school
environment was added to the model. This finding sug-
gests that there are other aspects about middle schools that
were not captured by teachers' perceptions about the school
environment that cause teachers dissatisfaction. It is impor-
tant to note that student challenges such as tardiness,
absences, class cutting, and apathy were included in school
environment and, thus, do not account for teacher dissatis-
faction in the model.
Implications
The implications of this study are numerous because of the
large number of variables examined. The most significant
implications will be noted. First, the results of this study
suggest that the school environment plays a major role in
the dissatisfaction of teachers. Efforts to understand teacher
satisfaction should include measures of the school environ-
ment to fully understand the phenomenon. In regards to
specific findings, Black teachers need to be examined in
more detail to better understand their unique experiences
and insights that may cause increased dissatisfaction among
them as a group. Qualitative studies may be particularly
helpful at identifying the concerns and challenges of being
a Black teacher. Along the same lines, rural schools and
middle schools should be examined in more detail to deter-
mine why these schools in particular cause higher rates of
dissatisfaction among teachers. Moreover, because teacher
unions are being threatened in the current political climate,
future studies might want to examine how teacher satisfac-
tion is affected by the weakening and loss of unions.
Limitations
Some findings could have sociopolitical ramifications if
taken out of context. All findings need further study to
uncover new data that will illuminate the nuances. The
Likert-type questions that were used to construct variables
were written in such a manner that a large majority of the
teachers fell to one extreme. Skewed variables violate the
assumptions of multiple regression and can be a source of
error. Because of the skewness of several variables, an OLS
regression could not be completed for dissatisfaction; rather,
a logistic regression was performed. Transforming the crite-
rion variable to make it dichotomous resulted in the loss of
variability within the data which might have affected the
final results.
