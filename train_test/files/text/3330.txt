Abstract
Objective: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe and often lethal infection.
The possible risk factors, clinical presentation, and treatment of patients with simultaneous liver
failure and IPA have received little attention in previous studies. The aim of this study was to investigate
the epidemiology of IPA in patients with liver failure in an effort to reduce patient mortality.
Methods: The patients with liver failure (including acute liver failure , sub-acute liver failure ,
acute-on-chronic liver failure and chronic liver failure) were recruited from 2011 to 2016. The
clinical data of these patients were retrieved for the study.
Results: In total, 1077 patients with liver failure were included in this study. Of the 1077 patients,
53 (4.9%) had IPA. Forty-four (83%) patients with IPA died. Independent risk factors for IPA were
male sex (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 2.542), hepatorenal syndrome (HR ¼ 2.463), antibiotic use
(HR ¼ 4.631), and steroid exposure (HR ¼ 18.615).
Conclusions: IPA is a fatal complication in patients with liver failure. Male sex, hepatorenal
syndrome, antibiotic use, and steroid exposure were independent risk factors for IPA. When
patients with liver failure have these risk factors and symptoms of pneumonia such as cough or
hemoptysis, clinicians should be cautious about the possibility of IPA.

Introduction
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a
severe and often lethal infection1 that mainly
affects immunocompromised patients, such
as those with hematologic malignancies and
stem cell or solid organ transplants.
Aspergillus spp. can cause invasive infection
in patients with liver failure.2­5 Although
patients with liver failure have a low inci-
dence of invasive aspergillosis, recent data
have indicated that this condition should be
reconsidered as a devastating infectious dis-
ease in this population.3­5 Wu et al.5 showed
that most patients with acute-on-chronic
liver failure (ACLF) died within 7 days
after the onset of IPA (25/29 patients).
Achieving a clinical diagnosis of IPA is a
huge challenge. Invasive diagnostic proced-
ures such as fiberbronchoscopy are neces-
sary to confirm a diagnosis of aspergillus
infection, but such procedures are often not
feasible in patients with severe respiratory
insufficiency and critical illness who are not
undergoing mechanical ventilation.6­9
Moreover, the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) restricted the scope of the stand-
ard diagnostic definitions to receipt of a
solid organ transplant, hereditary immuno-
deficiencies, connective tissue disorders, and
receipt of immunosuppressive agents10;
however, these criteria cannot necessarily
be extrapolated to patients with liver failure.
Few studies have been performed to
evaluate patients with liver failure who
develop IPA, and possible risk factors such
as the ABO blood group and use of an
artificial liver support system have received
little attention. Little is known about the
clinical presentation and treatment of IPA in
patients with liver failure. Therefore, the aim
of this study was to collect data about
patients with liver failure to investigate the
epidemiology and possible risk factors for
IPA in an effort to reduce the mortality in
this population.
Methods
Study design
This retrospective study was conducted in
the State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis
and Treatment of Infectious Diseases,
Department of Infectious Diseases, the First
Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine,
Zhejiang University, China. The study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the
First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang
University, and the need for consent was
waived because the study was retrospective
and the data were analyzed anonymously.
Study population
Patients with liver failure [including acute liver
failure (ALF), subacute liver failure (SALF),
ACLF, and chronic liver failure (CLF)] were
admitted into the infectious disease wards of
the First Affiliated Hospital, College of
Medicine, Zhejiang University, China from
2011 to 2016. The clinical data of these
patients were retrieved for the study. The
follow-up period for the patients with IPA
was 3 months after discharge.
Diagnostic criteria
Liver failure was defined according to the
following criteria specified by the 13th Asia-
Pacific Congress of Clinical Microbiology
and Infection Consensus Guidelines for the
diagnosis and treatment of liver failure:11
ALF: Abrupt onset accompanied by grade
II or higher hepatic encephalopathy (HE)
820 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
(according to the I- to IV-grade classifica-
tion) and appearance of the following symp-
toms within 2 weeks: a) fatigue with severe
gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as
anorexia, abdominal distension, nausea,
and vomiting; b) progressive aggravation
of jaundice; c) hemorrhagic tendency with
an international normalized ratio (INR) of
!1.5 or prothrombin activity (PTA) of
40% and exclusion of other causes;
and d) progressive reduction in liver size.
SALF: Slower onset than ALF and appear-
ance of the following symptoms within 2 to 26
weeks: a) fatigue with gastrointestinal tract
symptoms, b) rapidly deepening jaundice with
a total bilirubin (TBil) level 10 times higher
than the upper limit of normality or a daily
increase of !17.1mmol/L, c) occurrence of
HE, and d) hemorrhagic tendency with an
INR of !1.5 or PTA of 40% and exclusion
of other causes.
ACLF: Acute or subacute deterioration
of liver function in patients with chronic
liver disease, usually accompanied by the
following symptoms: a) fatigue with gastro-
intestinal tract symptoms, b) rapidly
deepening jaundice with a TBil level 10
times higher than the upper limit of normal-
ity or a daily increase of !17.1 mmol/L, c)
hemorrhagic tendency with an INR of !1.5
or PTA of 40% and exclusion of other
causes, d) progressive reduction in liver size,
and e) occurrence of HE.
CLF: Progressive deterioration and
decompensation of liver function in patients
with liver cirrhosis, usually accompanied by
the following symptoms: a) a significant
increase in TBil, b) a significant decrease in
albumin, c) a hemorrhagic tendency with an
INR of !1.5 or PTA of 40% and exclusion
of other causes, d) ascites or other symp-
toms of portal hypertension, and e) occur-
rence of HE.
We used the EORTC consensus defin-
ition of invasive Aspergillus infection,10
which was diagnosed if the following two
criteria were fulfilled: one microbiologic
criterion (positive sputum culture) and one
clinical criterion. In the present study, a
diagnosis of IPA was made based on the
following: a) positive culture of Aspergillus
spp. from sputum and b) the presence of one
of the following three signs on computed
tomography: dense, well-circumscribed
lesions(s) with or without a halo sign, air-
crescent sign, or cavity.
Risk factors for IPA
In this study, the following variables were
assessed as risk factors for the occurrence of
IPA: sex, age, ABO blood group, type 2
diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis, malig-
nancy, human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection, antibiotic use, steroid
exposure, use of an artificial liver support
system, neutropenia, gastrointestinal bleed-
ing, HE, and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
The definitions of some of these factors are
summarized in Table 1.
Table 1. Risk factors for invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis in patients with liver failure.
Risk factors Remarks (where applicable)
Chronic bronchitis Defined as the presence of a
productive cough or
expectoration for >90
days per year (but on
separate days) and for >2
consecutive years, pro-
vided that a specific
disorder responsible for
these symptoms is not
present.
Malignancy Solid tumor and hematologic
malignancy
HIV infection Defined as HIV-positive status
Antibiotic use Antimicrobial agent use for
>5 days
Steroid exposure Steroid treatment for >7 days
Neutropenia Total neutrophil count of
500/mm3
HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). Student's t-test was performed for
descriptive analysis and comparison of con-
tinuous variables. Fisher's exact probability
test and the chi-square test were conducted
to calculate and compare the percentages for
categorical variables. Logistic regression
analysis was used to examine the effects of
independent variables on IPA. P value of
<0.05 was considered statistically significant
for all analyses.
Results
Characteristics of the study cohort
In total, 1077 patients with liver failure
were included in this study. Of these 1077
patients, 826 (76.7%) were male and the
mean age was 49.22 Æ 13.45 years. The
characteristics of the patients are shown in
Table 2 and Table 3. The most common
reason for hospital admission was SCLF
(543/50.4%), and the main cause of liver
failure was hepatitis B (799/74.2%). A total
of 511 (47.4%) patients received artificial
liver support therapy, 710 (65.9%) received
antibacterial treatment for >5 days, and
84 (7.8%) were exposed to corticosteroids
for >7 days. The antibacterial treatments
were administered for both prophylaxis
and treatment (pneumonia, spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis, and septicemia).
Steroids were used to decrease persistent
hyperbilirubinemia and treat autoimmune
diseases. Eight (0.7%) patients developed
neutropenia.
Among all 1077 patients, 53 (4.9%)
were diagnosed with IPA. The characteris-
tics of the patients with IPA are shown
in Table 3. Twenty-five (47.2%) of these
patients had blood group O, 30 (56.6%) had
received artificial liver support therapy,
and 46 (86.8%) and 26 (49.1%) received
antibacterial drugs and corticosteroids,
respectively.
Risk factors
Logistic regression analysis showed that
male sex [hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 2.542,
p ¼ 0.035], HRS (HR ¼ 2.463, p ¼ 0.014),
antibiotic use (HR ¼ 4.631, p ¼ 0.001), and
steroid exposure (HR ¼ 18.615, p < 0.001)
were independent risk factors associated
with the occurrence of IPA (Table 4).
Clinical characteristics of patients with IPA
The symptoms and laboratory data of the 53
patients with IPA are shown in Table 5.
Among all patients with IPA 44 (83%)
died. After IPA diagnosis, three patients
were admitted to the intensive care unit
where mechanical ventilation and continu-
ous renal replacement therapy were applied.
Moreover, nine (17%) patients did not
receive antifungal treatment. Twenty-four
(45.3%) patients received voriconazole as
antifungal treatment, 16 (30.2%) received

Discussion
Invasive aspergillosis has been traditionally
regarded as an infection mainly occurring in
immunocompromised or immunodeficient
patients, such as those with neutropenia,
hematologic malignancies, organ trans-
plantation, or HIV.12 Although invasive
aspergillosis has been reported in patients
with liver cirrhosis and liver transplant-
ation,13,14,15 IPA has rarely been observed
in patients with liver failure.
A previous study16 confirmed invasive
aspergillosis as a frequent undiagnosed com-
plication of patients with ALF or end-stage
liver disease, with a mortality rate exceeding
70%. In the present study, the mortality rate
among patients with liver failure who devel-
oped IPA was 83%. The reason for the high

mortality was not only the difficulty in
diagnosis and treatment of IPA but also a
lack of enough recognition of IPA and the
heavy economic burden, which led patients
to give up treatments.
Diagnosis of IPA in patients with liver
failure is challenging. Patients with liver
failure often have a high bleeding tendency,
which is a contraindication for invasive
examinations such as pulmonary puncture
biopsy or bronchoscope. Thus, only one
patient in our study had tissue evidence of
Aspergillus fumigatus infection that was
acquired after the recovery of liver failure.
Moreover, liver failure is not a host factor
of invasive fungal disease in the EORTC
consensus; thus, the diagnosis of invasive
Aspergillus infection in patients with liver
failure is quite difficult according to the
EORTC consensus definition. Because of
delayed diagnosis and patients' financial
constraints, 17% of patients did not receive
antifungal treatment. One study16 showed
that a high percentage (52.8%) of patients
with acute or advanced liver disease were
diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis post-
mortem. Therefore, further research of the
epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical
manifestations of IPA in patients with liver
failure may improve the diagnosis rate.
In the present study, the incidence of IPA
in patients with liver failure was 4.9%.
Bone marrow transplantation, prolonged
neutropenia, and solid organ transplant-
ation have been identified as high-risk fac-
tors for invasive aspergillosis.17­21 Invasive
aspergillosis occurs in 1% to 9% of liver
transplant recipients14; this is similar to
the morbidity rate of the patients with liver
failure in the present study. As a result of a
depression of both humoral and cell-
mediated immunity, liver disease alone pre-
disposes to bacterial and fungal infections.22

immunosuppressed and should be con-
sidered an at-risk population for IPA.
An expert consensus23 recommended
that the main risk factors for IPA should
include neutropenia, malignancy, and pro-
longed steroid treatment. In the present
study, HRS (p ¼ 0.014), steroid exposure
(p < 0.001), and antibiotic use (p ¼ 0.001)
were independent risk factors associated
with the occurrence of IPA in patients with
liver failure. These findings are consistent
with those of previous research.3,4,22
In this study, 26 (49.1%) patients had
steroid exposure before IPA diagnosis.
Surprisingly, patients with liver failure who
took corticosteroids for >7 days had an 18-
fold (HR ¼ 18.615) higher risk of developing
IPA than those who did not use corticoster-
oids or used them for <7 days.
Corticosteroids predispose patients to
opportunistic infections through functional
impairment of macrophages and neutrophil
function.24 Thus, corticosteroids should be
used with caution in patients with liver
failure.
HRS may be precipitated by infection.25
Additionally, renal failure has been asso-
ciated with defective cell-mediated immunity
and impaired granulocyte­macrophage
function, which are the predominant host
defenses against fungal pathogens.26
Moreover, male sex (p ¼ 0.035) was also a
risk factor for IPA; this has not been found
in previous studies. A possible reason for
this result is that immune system damage in
male patients with liver failure is more severe
than in female patients. However, this needs
further research.
In patients with liver failure, both the
clinical diagnosis and treatment of IPA are
challenging. The guidelines of the Infectious
Diseases Society of America27 recom-
mended voriconazole as the primary therapy
for IPA. However, this drug is metabolized
in the liver and potentially hepatotoxic.27
Thus, it should be used with caution in
patients with liver failure patients. In the
present study, 24 (45.3%) patients received
voriconazole as an antifungal agent, and the
dose of voriconazole was not adjusted.
No skin rashes or transient visual disturb-
ances were observed. Moreover, it is difficult
to estimate whether liver injury has been
induced by voriconazole in patients with
liver failure. Because such patients' liver
function is severely damaged, infection
could lead to impaired liver function and
ultimately higher mortality.28 However,
liver function did not worsen after using
voriconazole in our recovered patients.
Our study has some limitations. First, the
small numbers of patients with some host
factors of invasive fungal disease develop-
ment in the EORTC consensus, such as HIV
or neutropenia, may have led to statistical
error. Second, liver failure is not a host
factor of invasive fungal disease develop-
ment in the EORTC consensus; therefore,
the patients in our study did not fulfill
the definition of proven IPA according
to the EORTC consensus. Moreover, inva-
sive diagnostic procedures were not feasible
in our patients with liver failure, which
may have resulted in missing patients
with suspected disease based on radiologic
imaging. Third, we did not collect data
on the daily corticosteroid dose and could
not fully explore the impact of dose or
duration on mortality. Finally, male sex as
a risk factor for IPA was not thoroughly
researched.
In conclusion, IPA is a potentially fatal
complication in patients with liver failure,
and delayed diagnosis and treatment may
contribute to high mortality. Steroid expos-
ure, antibiotic use, male sex, and HRS were
independent risk factors associated with the
occurrence of IPA. When patients with liver
failure have these risk factors and symptoms
of pneumonia such as cough or hemoptysis,
clinicians should be aware of the possibility
of IPA. Early and appropriate antifungal
treatment may improve the survival rate in
patients with liver failure.
