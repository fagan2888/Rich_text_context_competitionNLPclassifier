Introduction
In 2010, an estimated one and a half million new cancer
cases were diagnosed (American Cancer Society, 2010).
Among those newly diagnosed, approximately 10% were
younger than 45 years (Jensen, Morbeck, & Coddington,
2011). Thus, there are large numbers of cancer patients who
are of or approaching childbearing age. Every year in Canada
and the United States, about 26,000 adolescents and young
adults (AYA) between ages 15 and 29 years are diagnosed
with cancer (Tonorezos & Oeffinger, 2011). Although the
majority of AYA cancer patients will survive their primary
cancer, many will develop other serious health problems
(Tonorezos & Oeffinger, 2011). Young adults with cancer in
one study indicated infertility problems to be a significant
health issue leading to poor psychosocial outcomes (Schwartz
et al., 2010).
Fertility preservation (FP) is one of the answers to this
problem apart from adopting or opting to remain childless
(Schover, Rybicki, Martin, & Bringelsen, (1999). FPincludes
methods and efforts to maintain the ability of a person to
reproduce even after natural or other illness-related fertility
loss (Coyne, Kader, & Agarwal, 2010). Modern technologi-
cal advancements have made FP a feasible option for cancer
patients to have biological children in the future. To advance
FP technology as a viable option for young cancer patients,
the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June 2006
published guidelines for oncologists to address FP while pro-
viding treatment and counseling for cancer patients (Lee
et al., 2006). These guidelines recommend discussing infer-
tility as a side effect of cancer treatment and providing FP as
an option. Providers are advised to apply their clinical judg-
ment and discuss the possibility of fertility damage or loss at
the earliest possible opportunity (Lee et al., 2006).
Studies indicate that communication between patients and
health care professionals has a profound effect on patients'
outcomes and behavior (Stewart, 1995). Effective communi-
cation reduces patients' suffering and anxiety during treat-
ment (Fellowes, Wilkinson, & Moore, 2004). Patients seek a
trusting relationship balancing the provider's role as an
expert and as a partner in decision making (Epstein, 2006).
Patient­provider communication is crucial in providing FP
services to patients.

Abstract
Fertility preservation (FP) for patients with cancer is an emerging field. With the advancement of technology, patients may
face a complex decision-making process about whether to preserve fertility. The purpose of this article is to explore how
young women with cancer perceive patient­provider communication in FP decision making. In this study, 25 women between
the ages of 18 and 39 were interviewed retrospectively. They were interviewed one time to learn about their decision-
making process related to FP. Results of this analysis indicate that patients seek support and involvement from providers
throughout the process of decision making. They prefer providers to be directive when referring to the fertility clinic. Later
in the process, they expect a supportive style of communication from providers. Patient-accessible language, supportive and
reassuring styles of communication, and an existing relationship with providers may enhance well-being of the patients.

Patient­Provider Communication
There are a number of challenges in discussing FP with
young cancer patients. Barriers identified in FP are (a) physi-
cian factors that contribute to communication issues with FP
discussion (e.g., awareness and sense of comfort in discuss-
ing issues, perceptions of the treatment-related priority),
(b) parental factors (e.g., receptiveness and cultural back-
ground of the patients' parents), (c) patient factors (e.g.,
receptiveness and age), and (d) institutional factors like
referral sites and practice guidelines (Vadaparampil, Quinn,
King, Wilson, & Nieder, 2008). Oncologists and other cancer
care professionals face challenges in discussing FP and help-
ing patients in FP decision making. Cancer remains a highly
delicate subject, and discussing it with young adults may
incorporate added challenges like lack of awareness about
specific psychosocial complications of this age group
(Quinn, Vadaparampil, Bell-Ellison, Gwede, & Albrecht,
2008). Discussing fertility options with patients is difficult
for health care professionals unless they work in reproduc-
tive health (Schover, Rybicki, Martin, & Bringelsen, 1999).
Oncologists and other physicians may focus on treating
malignancy and survivorship rather than discussing FP
(Patrizio, Butts, & Caplan, 2005). Physicians may also have
serious concerns about potential delays in cancer treatment
necessary for FP procedures (Vadaparampil, Quinn, King,
Wilson, & Nieder, 2008).
Most of the past research on FP communication is from
the provider's perspective (Vadaparampil, Quinn, Lancaster,
et al., 2008). Previous studies have highlighted the impor-
tance of patient­provider communication in patients with
cancer; however, young patient's informational needs are
still not adequately met (Quinn & Vadaparampil, 2009;
Zebrack, 2008). In this qualitative study, we further explore
the communication needs of the patients at various stages of
treatment.
The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of
the communication process that occurs between young adult
women with cancer and health care professionals (including
nurses, oncologists, social workers, and other clinic staff)
during the time women are making decisions about FP. In
particular, this analysis documents patients' viewpoints on
three sets of interactions with health care professionals, and
identifies factors that lead to positive or negative experiences
among patients. These interactions are (a) first discussion of
fertility compromise and fertility issues, (b) first appoint-
ment at the fertility clinic, and (c) subsequent discussion
about fertility with health care professionals.
Method
Study Design
As part of a larger research study (Block, Frohnmayer,
Jivanjee, & Brandon Hayes-Lattin, 2012) designed to gain
understanding of the FP decision-making processes of young
adults, a focused qualitative analysis was completed to
explore and describe women's experiences of interactions
with health care professionals. This study represents a sec-
ondary analysis of the data collected for the primary study.
While the data collection for the larger study is described
below, the data analysis process and the results presented
here are specific to FP communication. Secondary data anal-
ysis of existing data was approved by the medical institute
IRB in which data were collected.Approval also ensured that
the objectives of the secondary analysis corresponded with
the objectives of the original study for which participant con-
sents were obtained.
Sample and Setting
Participants.Qualitative interviews were conducted with
25 participants recruited at the oncology center of a large
teaching hospital. Although eligibility criteria for study par-
ticipants included being a woman between ages 15 and 39 at
the time of interview and aware of potential fertility compro-
mise due to cancer treatment, the actual sample had patients
in 18 to 38 age range. These interviews were done retrospec-
tively with the patients. Data are generated from only one
interview with the patients. Patients were paid US$30 and
the interviews were 60-min long. Twenty-three participants
were Caucasian, 1 was Hispanic, and 1 was African Ameri-
can. Diagnoses included the following: leukemia, Hodgkin's
lymphoma, breast cancer, sarcoma, colorectal cancer, adre-
nal cortical carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and multiple
myeloma. Five participants (19%) had children prior to their
initial cancer diagnosis and 1 had a baby between first treat-
ment and relapse. Eighteen (69%) participants opted for a
consultation appointment with reproductive endocrinologist
and 10 (39%) of those women pursued or planned to pursue
FP. Eight women opted out of the consultation.
Setting. The research setting was an academic medical insti-
tution in the northwest of the United States. This institution
has an adolescent and young adult oncology program
designed to provide consultation services and research
opportunities for patients with cancer between 15 and
39 years old. This program has done extensive outreach and
education within the hospital and clinics.
A typical clinical flow of FP treatment includes multiple
interactions with health care professionals that can be
grouped into three sets. The first set is when a patient learns
about her fertility compromise and available options to pro-
tect her fertility. This communication may be with an oncolo-
gist, nurse, or any provider who first discussed fertility
compromise with the patient. The second set is when a
patient has a scheduled consultation with a fertility special-
ist. This set includes communication with fertility special-
ists, who may be nurses and doctors at the fertility clinic. The
third set of interaction is after the first appointment at the
fertility clinic when the patient may consult with various
Mathur et al. 3
health care professionals while engaged in the decision-
making process. This includes communication with the pri-
mary health care providers, nurses, gynecologists, or other
providers with whom patients initiated conversations for
advice on fertility. Considering the clinical flow of FP treat-
ment, this article examines patient­provider communication
grouped into these three sets of interaction.
Data Collection
In-person interviews with participants were done in a private
setting. Interviews included questions on the patients' expe-
riences of first finding out about the potential compromise to
their fertility and the subsequent consultation experiences
with their oncologists and fertility specialists. Examples of
the questions include,
Tell me the story of your diagnosis and finding out that your
cancer treatment might affect your ability to have children. How
did you find out about fertility consultation services for people
with cancer? What was helpful about the consultation? What
was not helpful?
Interviews were conducted after at least the first set of
communication when patients were informed about fertility
compromise. Some patients opted to move on to the first fer-
tility consultation and discussed the second and third sets of
FP communication during the interview.
The interview schedule contained questions beyond the
scope of this project and only data related to patient­provider
communication were included in this analysis. All the inter-
views were recorded, transcribed, and uploaded in the NVIVO
software package to support qualitative data analysis.
Data Analysis
Straus and Corbin's (1990) open-coding method of data
analysis was used to identify themes. Because the researcher
was involved in thematic analysis of data for the larger study,
she had already reviewed the data prior to this analysis. New
codes were created in NVIVO relevant to this analysis and
sections of the interviews beyond the scope of this project
were disregarded. After reviewing and open-coding eight
interviews, the researcher developed a codebook to identify
basic themes and their relationships to one another. This
codebook was not a set of rigid codes but a fluid document
responsive to new codes and relationships that emerged dur-
ing later coding of the interviews. Once all codes were iden-
tified, all of the interviews were revisited and recoded. The
inductive method of data analysis was used. Themes and
subthemes emerged from the data through reading and re-
reading multiple times. While analyzing the themes, the
number of cases represented within each theme was noted.
Wherever possible, participants' own words were used to
label styles to stay close to the original transcripts or they
were labeled based on a communication literature review and
peer debriefing with other members of the research team.
Data analysis was guided by the specific objective of
identifying any text related to major aspects of provider­
patient communication and what meaning patients assigned
to the communication. The communication style was named
according to what best described the style, and at times was
labeled using the words of patients. Patient's state of mind
was examined as it is believed to affect her satisfaction with
the providers' communication style (Ben-Sira, 1980). Any
communication relevant to the patient describing her mental
state was categorized as state of mind.
Results
Based on the clinical flow of FP treatment, responses were
classified into three sets of communication with the
provider.
1. First was the discussion of cancer treatment's effects
on fertility and FP. In this set of communications,
patients reported their experience of finding out
about the possibility of fertility compromise due to
cancer treatment. Communication centered on the
risks associated with cancer treatments and also the
various fertility options available to the patient.
Major themes that evolved during this stage were the
patient's state of mind, providers' characteristics
(gender, occupation), and communication styles.
Similar themes were then explored in the next two
sets of communication. Patients discussed their pro-
viders' communication style along with the provid-
ers' characteristics; hence providers' gender and
profession were noted in the transcripts.
2. Second was the initial appointment at the fertility
clinic. This included patients talking about their ini-
tial appointments after referral from another provider.
Major themes identified in this stage were patient's
state of mind, provider's communication style, and
information (clarity and adequacy) provided to the
patients. Because this study was done in one clinic,
characteristics of the fertility consultants were not
noteworthy as most patients were attended by same
consultants. Patients focused more on the informa-
tion provided to them.
3. Third was a subsequent discussion about FP options.
During the subsequent discussions about FP with a
provider stage, patients discussed their conversation
with providers after the initial appointments to reach a
decision about FP. Major themes that emerged were
patient's state of mind, provider's characteristics, pro-
vider's communication style, and relationship with
provider.As at this stage patients went back to the pro-
viders with whom they were comfortable, a new theme
of previous relationship with providers emerged.
4 SAGE Open
First Discussions of Fertility
Compromise and Preservation
The major themes were the patient's state of mind and the
communication style of the provider. The gender and profes-
sion of the provider were extracted from the transcripts as
mentioned by the patients during the interview.
Provider's Communication Styles
The three provider communication styles identified were
directive, indifferent, and supportive.
Directive.Style was categorized as directive if providers
offered direction on next steps and the directions were fol-
lowed. A directive style was noted when health care profes-
sionals provided a clear line of action with some assertiveness
to comply. Some patients (n = 5) felt their providers had a
directive approach. For example,
She was sort of the guiding force, like these are the things that
we would recommend. I can make the appointments for you and
you can just kind of coast along and just attend them. You drive
the bus and I'll just sit in the back is kind of how it went.
Supportive. Supportive style meant when patients were pro-
actively provided information and emotional help.
Only two patients felt the professional's style was sup-
portive. These patients appreciated provider's initiative in
providing FP information and were interested in their overall
well-being. For example, one of the patients said,
She even specifically told me, I'm going to tell you about this
because you are probably not going to have a lot of doctors
that this is a concern for them. I want you to know before you
go through anything, because you are a young adult and this
kind of stuff. She just said, you at least need to know that this
is something you could potentially have to deal with in the
future.
Your situation, you decide/indifferent. However, some patients
(n = 4) felt that the professionals' style was indifferent. Here
the provider presented the facts to the patient and left it up to
her to decide without offering details or showing interest in
the patient as an individual. For example, "I'm not the person
going through this situation, so decide what you need to
decide," basically. He is like, "it is a low risk but I don't want
to say that and have something happen."
Patient's State of Mind During the First FP
Discussion
A reflection reported by some patients (n = 5) was that fertil-
ity news came embedded with other information and in itself
was not the top priority, "I was just so overwhelmed with
everything else.At that point it wasn't a real concern. I hadn't
thought about it a lot. I was mainly focused on getting
through the whole [treatment]."
However, others (n = 4) mentioned their disappointment
and feelings of sadness upon hearing the news of fertility
compromise. One of the patients said, "When they told me I
couldn't have any more kids, I kind of felt like, of course,
kind of crappy. Well, it was kind of taken away, if I did want
that option."
While describing their feelings, participants also recalled
their thoughts about having kids. For a few patients, this was
the first time they seriously thought about having children as
they were young:
I'm not sure that I knew how to feel about it at the time, because
we weren't sure at the time whether we wanted to have children
or not. It felt like we were kind of having to make a split-second
decision on something that we had thought we had a number of
years to figure out.
Provider's Characteristics
The first person to inform participants about fertility com-
promise varied in gender and professional role. Patients'
experience of first learning about FP was from a nurse, social
worker, or oncologist. Most often this information was pro-
vided by the treating oncologist (n = 8). A few patients also
found out from their nurse (n = 3) and others from a social
worker, surgeon, or a doctor other than the treating oncolo-
gist. For example, one woman was told about FP by another
doctor rounding on her floor the first night she was in the
hospital.
In this sample, female health care professionals (n = 11)
and male providers (n = 10) discussed fertility issues with
patients. The gender of the health care professional who
informed the remaining four participants is unknown.
First Appointment at the Fertility
Clinic
At this stage of the clinical workflow, in addition to patient's
state of mind and provider's style, themes around the infor-
mation provided to patients were identified. It is at this stage
that patients were provided their first consultation with a fer-
tility expert and received FP information. Participants dis-
cussed their views on the adequacy and clarity of information
provided to them.
Provider's Communication Style
Three major styles identified were directive, supportive, and
indifferent (see Table 1).
Directive.Patients mostly talked about the conversations
with their fertility specialist. Some patients found the pro-
vider's style directive (n = 7), when they assertively
Mathur et al. 5
recommended the FP option that the patients should opt for.
As one of the patients expressed, "As much as he went over
all this stuff, he gave us these options and basically said you
probably want to do one of these two and I would recom-
mend this one."
Supportive.Only two patients found their providers' style
supportive and comforting. One participant liked this style
because the provider took a holistic approach, considering
the life situation of the patient and her interests. The patient
said,
The consultation was just really reassuring. It was kind of
awkward because it was with my dad and it is a place where
people go to have babies and stuff . . . I don't think anything
wrong happened from it at all, because it (a) gave me an option
and (b) he gave me really good advice that my oncologist agreed
with, with the birth control.
Your situation, you decide/indifferent. Some of the patients
(n = 4) felt that providers were not as involved as they
wanted them to be. Hence, they perceived the providers to
be very impersonal:
All of those thing(s) is a lot (information provided at the first
appointment with FP specialist). Then, again, that is their job. I
just kind of felt like they . . . for something like that I would want
to be able to build a relationship with a doctor and come up with
some personalized plans. I didn't necessarily have that feeling
from the first visit.
Patient's State of Mind
Patients talked about how they felt before and during their
first appointment at the clinic. As some patients were in the
process of cancer treatment, they felt confused and disori-
ented. As one of them said, "I have such bad memory. You
have given me the chemo."
One of the patients felt that along with chemotherapy and
radiation, going for another appointment for fertility consul-
tation was a lot.
Mostly patients thought about their current life status and
how appropriate fertility options were for them:
I went in there. It was definitely overwhelming, like listening to
it, because at that point in time I was just like, I don't want kids.
I had to make the decision if I wanted to have that chance within
a couple of hours. I was like . . .
For other patients, having information about FP was
important to make the right decision. FP was like an insur-
ance policy for the patients, if their situation improved in
future. As one woman said,
So I guess I kind of knew that there is a potential that maybe
there is nothing they can do for me, I guess. But I guess I just
kind of always felt that things are in the works, and, again, I
don't want that opportunity to pass at that point.
Information
Some participants felt the information was too much and at
times overwhelming. Patients felt too many choices and lack
of a definite line of treatment left them scared or stressed.
[My doctor] is like, this is relatively a new thing and I'm just
like, I don't know if I want to try it. I don't really want to be a
guinea pig. So, yeah, we did have the information and way too
much more, or maybe we didn't actually get any of it. It didn't
sink in. It was so out there and we were just like, we just sat in
this room for an hour, and oh, my gosh.
Some patients expected the conversation about the cost of
FP to be more explicit as pricing was one of the major decid-
ing factors for them.
There was sort of this vagueness about pricing and how much it
was going to be. I always felt like I had to inquire, well, how much
is that procedure going to be and how much is this bit and what is
it going to look like all together. That was sort of this gray area.
She kept saying, oh, you have to ask at the desk. That is a huge
part of my decision making, how much is this going to cost me.
Although most of the patients felt they got sufficient
information at their appointment in the fertility clinic, a few
suggested that pamphlet information with pricing was their
best guiding tool in decision making.
I don't know if I learned it from [my doctor/the fertility
specialist]. I think just reading stuff, because they were almost
like do the research things, like . . . like mice or rats or whatever.
I don't want to do that stuff. It was mostly reading the pamphlets
and stuff like that.
The content of information for the most part was compre-
hensible; a few patients felt they were provided with unnec-
essary information on current research and it was difficult to

understand. Due to the research-oriented language in the
information provided, participants could not appreciate vari-
ous FP options available to them.
When I listened to the doctor talk about all the studies and
things, I don't know if I would have chosen a different option
because I really didn't understand the different options. But I
would have appreciated the time to step back and go, okay, this
is this. I can do this and this will happen.
Subsequent Discussions
These results refer to the time beyond the first appointment
at the fertility clinic after patients were given information
about FP. Patients discussed their feelings about the fertility
clinic and experiences with the providers who helped them
think through their decision. Patients' recollections beyond
their appointments with fertility specialists are captured in
this section. It is an important phase where patients' are
thinking through the decision and have described how dis-
cussions with various providers helped them through the
process. Patient's relationship with the professional was an
emergent theme at this stage of the clinical workflow.
Patients discussed their existing rapport with the provider to
whom they returned for subsequent discussions. Two other
themes were provider's style and patient's state of mind.
Provider's style
Directive.Some patients (n = 8) described the provider's
style as directive in this phase. Most of the patients who
reported the style as directive said that they were told to
adopt a particular method of FP. As one patient said,
He said you definitely don't want to wait until you go through
your first round of chemo because the chance of damaging your
tissues or different things likes that or just the possibility of there
being more of an issue with fertility later on. He goes it is best to
go in and actually preserve that ovary now before you even start
your first round of chemo.
Supportive.About a quarter of participants (n = 6) reported
that their providers were supportive with their decision-mak-
ing process. Patients approached their fertility specialist, pri-
mary care physician, social worker, or nurse depending on
with whom they had a rapport and what conversations they
remembered. Most patients talked about the providers who
discussed their problems with them versus those who just
provided them information. As one patient mentioned,
She was just so positive and just, like I said, gave me enough
clinical information and statistics but didn't overwhelm me with
it. She sat down with a diagram. She wrote out what my
treatment plan was going to look like, really took time with me.
Not that this other surgeon has not done that, but he just doesn't
have the same, it is just not the same approach.
Two patients described instances when the provider was
being supportive and reassuring. One of them described her
health care professional as a mentor. For example, "I defi-
nitely was a decision maker. I knew what I wanted to do and
how to do it. But I always, at the same time, I always looked
at them as being a mentor. They have been through this."
Your situation, you decide/indifferent.A quarter of the patients
(n = 6) reported providers as being indifferent and not relat-
ing to their problem. As one of the patients said,
Yeah, and I think he might be a little surprised by my having not
decided yet. I said to him, when I saw him a few weeks ago, he
was like, oh, have you decided. I said, you know, I really haven't
decided. He kind of joked and said, well, you can decide up until
you're in the prep, right before your anesthesia. You can decide
. . . And that made me feel a little abandoned by him, as far as
like, this is your decision, just let me know and I'll do whatever
you want me to do. I don't know, it feels like of lonely.
A couple of patients felt that they were being pushed from
provider to provider with no one taking the responsibility or
helping them make a decision.
Patient's State of Mind Before Subsequent
Discussions With Providers
After their first appointment some patients felt stressed,
overwhelmed, and scared about the procedure. One of them
said, "I remember just being really scared and paranoid and
just really thinking what am I getting myself into, like if this
isn't going to work, then is it really worth it."
Another patient said, "It is too much. It is too much. It is
too much information. It is too much emotionally and it is
hard to remember why I decided certain things."
However, a few others felt confident and satisfied with the
decision they made. Patients also described their difficult
situation about choosing between starting cancer treatment
right away and waiting to complete FP treatment before
beginning their cancer treatment.
Provider Characteristics and Their Relationship
With the Providers
All the participants who talked about subsequent discussions
(n = 7) with health care professionals approached a female
provider, of whom three were nurses, two social workers,
and two doctors.
Some participants explicitly expressed their comfort with
female providers as they understood them better:
I have my oncologist who is a female--I say that only because I
do think that that kind of weighs into their ability to relate to this
decision. We have been talking a lot over the course of the last
several months. I'm still undecided as to what to do.
Mathur et al. 7
Two participants discussed their relationship and comfort
with providers. Both indicated that an existing relationship
made them feel comfortable talking to the provider.
With my primary care . . . now I would have called my gyno
[gynecologist] because I know her really well and I have a really
good relationship with her now. I would ask her what she would
do. When you go from no medical history, I didn't have anybody
that I could trust that was a professional. Now I have my
psychologist, my primary care, two oncologists, my naturopath.
I have people that I always know that I can go to.
Discussion
This study reveals new insights into patient­provider com-
munication during fertility decision-making processes.
Overall it provides patients' perspectives on communication
with providers while making a FP decision.
Provider's Style of Communication
Comparing all three sets of communications, the directive
style was preferred by patients during the first discussion
where providers emphasized the importance of a first consul-
tation. The least preferred style was that of indifference.
However, during the first fertility consultation, patients liked
a supportive style where their current life situation was
included in the discussion along with information on FP pro-
cedures. It is important to discuss patient's current life situa-
tion including relationship status and to provide advice
regarding procedures for exclusive egg preservation or
zygote preservation. Supportive style was preferred again
during subsequent discussions as patients liked longer dis-
cussions to reach a decision on FP. Results indicated that
some patients perceived directive styles as positive. A num-
ber of previous studies of adults report that cancer patients
vary substantially in their preference for participation in
decision making (Blanchard, Labrecque, Ruckdeschel, &
Blanchard, 1988; Degner & Sloan, 1992; Gattellari, Butow,
Tattersall, Dunn, & MacLeod, 1999). In fact, in one study,
the physician's recommendation was a strong predictor of
whether a patient opted for FP (Schover, Brey, Lichtin,
Lipshultz, & Jeha, 2002). Although these studies are not spe-
cifically done with AYA populations, similar results emerged
in the current article where participants demonstrated appre-
ciation for the directive style of the professionals. One plau-
sible explanation for favoring directive styles may be the
need for clear directions from health care providers when
patients felt overwhelmed with information. A recent study
on pretreatment counseling for FP showed higher satisfac-
tion among patients counseled by both oncologists and fertil-
ity specialists rather than by only oncologists (Letourneau et
al., 2010). This study highlights preference for directive
style, especially when it meant insisting on fertility clinic
consultations, as it may lead to counseling sessions with both
oncologists and fertility specialists and more informed basis
of decision making.
Indifference on the part of providers while communicat-
ing was mostly unacceptable. Patients expressed discomfort
when providers ended conversations by detaching them-
selves from patients and leaving the entire ownership of the
decision to them. A study of women with breast cancer
showed that patients have emotional needs and seek reassur-
ance from their health care professionals (Bakker, Fitch,
Gray, Reed, & Bennett, 2000). Affective communication
showing understanding of a patient's life situation and build-
ing trust are important for patient satisfaction (Bakker et al.,
2000). Hence, an indifferent, detached communication style
is the least preferred style.
At first appointment in the clinic, patients expressed their
stress and fear about the procedure. Anxiety before a medical
procedure is common among patients (Kindler, Szirt,
Sommer, Häusler, & Langewitz, 2005). A study of preopera-
tive patient­provider communication suggests that having
patient-centered conversations where focus is on psychoso-
cial issues with discussions surrounding emotions before
operations helps reduce anxiety among patients (Kindler et
al., 2004). Although hospitals and clinics are resource and
time-constrained, results indicate that there is a need for fer-
tility counseling services to provide information about the
procedures.
Information. There is no one consistent source of FP informa-
tion for the patients. Patients heard about this service through
different providers (nurses, oncologists, and others).
Feeling overwhelmed with information may imply that
patients felt inundated with too much information along with
the cancer diagnosis and treatment discussion. Feelings of
sadness may emerge from the feeling of loss of an important
organ function. Providers while communicating to the
patients about possible fertility loss should be responsive to
a patient's individual state of mind to ease them through the
process of decision making about FP. Information on the
pamphlet provided was useful for the patients.
Most of the patients liked when providers gave them a list
of options but strongly recommended the one they thought
best suited to them. Hence, they found a directive style to be
useful at this stage. Along with clear recommendation of the
FP method to be used, discussions with the provider around
the patient's life stage and situation helped patients make
their choices. This analysis suggests that patients were more
satisfied when provider­patient communication went beyond
medical facts, and related to the patient's current life
situation.
Patient's State of Mind
Through the stages of communication, the patient's state of
mind changed depending on the information she received. In
the reflection of the first discussion about fertility, patients
8 SAGE Open
focused on their reaction to the news of fertility compromise,
including feeling overwhelmed with information and disap-
pointment. Some patients reported how first consultation
with a fertility specialist helped them start thinking about
having children in the future. In the subsequent discussions
set, patients started considering the possible options dis-
cussed in the fertility consultation and felt stressed about the
procedure itself. Others felt relieved after making a decision
about FP. Some of the patients in this study were either in the
process of cancer treatment or treated for a relapse at the time
of the study. Results indicate that within the context of many
other life-changing decisions, FP was one more important
decision to be made. Although for patients the outcome of
their chemotherapy could not be accurately predicted, they
went for their fertility appointment with the mind-set that
having information was important and FP may be helpful in
future.
Providers' Characteristics
Patients encountered various providers through their FP
decision-making process. There was no consistency observed
across the three sets of communication as to who provided
information initially about fertility and to whom patients
went back for subsequent discussions. Throughout the three
sets of communication, these data reflect a lack of one point
person to whom patients returned after consultation with
other providers.
The participants in the present study offer important
insights into their preferences for communication styles and
services from providers. This insight could assist in the
development of strategies for communication in this field,
including tailoring communication styles to meet the needs
of young adult patients. Patients reported feeling most com-
fortable with female health care professionals in discussing
FP and they preferred to return to them for further consulta-
tion. As gender comparison was not the focus of this analy-
sis, this study cannot endorse a preference for female
providers. But the fact that patients found it meaningful
enough to discuss in the interview reflects for this sample of
patients that female providers do approach fertility discus-
sion with appreciated sensitivity. Previous relationships with
health care professionals helped patients think through their
decisions. It is difficult for patients to establish a relationship
with oncologists or surgeons in the short period between
diagnosis and treatment. One study shows that as primary
care provider, the gynecologist may interact with patients
throughout the cancer care continuum, and this puts gyne-
cologists in a unique position to join the onco-fertility team
in providing young cancer patients with needed support
(Duncan, Jozefik, Kim, Hirshfeld-Cytron, & Woodruff,
2011). For patients who have an ongoing relationship with
their gynecologist, it may be useful to involve them in FP
discussions.
It is evident from the results that most patients heard
about their potential fertility compromise from their oncolo-
gist. But the information also came from various other
sources, including nurses, social workers, and other profes-
sionals. It may be beneficial to involve other health care pro-
fessionals in the process of providing FP information.
Streamlining the process of FP treatment may avoid unnec-
essary delay in starting the treatment, for example, setting a
standard protocol for informing patients about FP and timely
referrals to social workers and the fertility clinic.
Limitations
This was an exploratory study and results obtained from this
study may help generate research questions for future studies.
However, due to the small and nondiverse sample, generaliz-
ability of the data to wider population may not be possible.
Secondary data analysis of the qualitative interviews
can pose certain limitations. These limitations may include
lack of knowledge of the context of the primary study and
insensitivity to the data (Hinds, Vogel, & Clarke-Steffen,
1997). However, as the researcher was involved with the
primary data analysis, the researcher is familiar with the
data and context in this case. Questions in the interview
schedule were not written to generate data regarding com-
munication with providers specifically, which may limit
the extent to which these patterns were discussed explicitly
with participants.
Data were collected retrospectively from the patients;
hence, there may be some recall biases. However, the pur-
pose of the article was to capture the feelings about the con-
versation and what exactly stayed with participants from the
communication rather than the exact content of the commu-
nication, and thus captures the long-term impact of patient­
provider communication on the patients.
Due to single interviews with the patients, there is an
absence of data triangulation. This limitation was compen-
sated with the review of other qualitative and quantitative
research studies to observe if similar findings were found by
other research groups.
This analysis may incorporate the researcher's biases
such as gender bias as the researcher is a woman who may
approach fertility from a different perspective than men. Peer
debriefing was done to include views of other researchers
and diminish the personal biases of the researcher.
Research and Practice Implications
Practice Implications
FP advice to young adult patients must be delivered in a
patient-centered manner. FP discussion with an appointed
provider who may be with the patient throughout the deci-
sion-making process may lessen the feeling of abandonment.
Mathur et al. 9
A dedicated social worker or nurse trained specially in the FP
field may provide this supportive role during the procedure.
More involvement of providers with whom patients have an
existing relationship in the onco-fertility team may improve
the patient's satisfaction with the decision-making process.
Complicated language may be a barrier to patients' ease
of decision making. FP information should be in a language
accessible to the patients. Fertility consultation may be sup-
ported by the provision of pamphlets with FP information to
take home. Presentation of FP information needs further
attention.
Other studies on guidelines for communication on cancer
diagnosis, treatment, and implications of treatment should be
derived from patient-based data rather than be limited only to
clinical opinion (P. N. Butow et al., 1996). Hence, when dis-
cussing risk to fertility, health care professionals need to
account for the patient's state of mind rather than relying
solely on their own clinical judgment.
Research Implications
This study addresses patient's perceptions of communication
styles. Future research may focus on finding more about
communication content, timing, and who should provide this
information.
Content of information.This article emphasizes the impor-
tance of patient-centered communication of information.
The content and mode (flyers, posters, FP awareness cam-
paign, etc.) of information dissemination can be researched
further to increase awareness. More studies on FP communi-
cation studying the impact of an FP awareness campaign
may be useful.
Who should provide information?Findings from this analysis
state that FP information was provided to the patients by
various providers. Although most patients got information
from their oncologists, others were informed by nurses,
social workers, and other health care providers. Patients also
discussed the gender of the provider who first discussed FP
with them. There are unanswered questions about whose
responsibility it is to discuss it first. Research should deter-
mine who along the cancer treatment continuum is the best
person to discuss FP with patients?
Conclusion
Findings from this study indicate that it is essential to
acknowledge that the FP process is complicated and patients
look for more support than is currently provided to them.
Directive style of communication, considering patient's sta-
tus and state of mind during initial phase of information pro-
vision may improve the patient's experience of the fertility
decision-making process. Later as patients progress in the FP
decision-making process, providers'supportive style of com-
munication may lead to higher satisfaction among the
patients. Enhancing the quality of support to patients through
effective patient­provider communication should be a prior-
ity for health care providers. Women undergoing cancer
treatment face immense stress of treatment and decision
making. The provider's role is not to merely provide infor-
mation but to support her through the process of decision
making. Understanding this communication process and
responding to the needs of the patients will empower women
to make the fertility choices that are right for them.
