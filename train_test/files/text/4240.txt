India completed 67 years as a Republic on January 26, 2017.
This is not a long period in temporal terms. However, the
journey appears decidedly longer if one takes into consider-
ation the history of the struggle against imperialism when the
nation was "imagined," the seeds of nationhood were sown,
and the concept of the republic took shape. The Indian
Freedom Struggle raged from 19th century. The vision of a
free India was articulated by Sri Aurobindo (1997) thus,
A nation is building in India today before the eyes of the world
so swiftly, so palpably that all can watch the process . . . One of
oldest races and greatest civilizations on this earth . . . is seeking
to lift itself for good into an organized national unity . . . Our aim
will therefore be to help in building up India for the sake of
humanity--this is spirit of Nationalism we profess and follow.
(pp. 22, 27)
To be free of foreign shackles and demand self-gover-
nance, Bal Gangadhar Tilak's fiery words "Swaraj is my
birthright and I shall have it!" exhorted people against the
country's political and economic plight under colonialism.
He wanted favorable conditions for Indians to learn to gov-
ern themselves as a nation-state. Swaraj, for M. K. Gandhi,
was not an expedient political term, but meant control from
within, disciplining of the self. He believed Swaraj leads to
Sarvodaya or comprehensive progress and holistic uplift-
ment. Gandhi highlighted the ethical aspect of political and
public life that guided the formulation of the Fundamental
Rights charter in the Indian Constitution. Gandhi's signifi-
cant contribution was also the deployment of "dissent" as
political awareness "primarily intended to promote social
change" (see Gandhi, 1938/1984; Chatterjee, 1986; Bleiker,
2000).
The term republic is generally applied to a nation-state
where the government's political power depends on the con-
sent, however nominal, of the people governed.As a political
concept, res publica makes citizens stake-holders in the gov-
erning process at one level or another, ensuring that they are
not indifferent or unaffected by the decisions taken by those

How Fares the Well? A Study of the
Interstices of the Welfare State: Bharati
Sarabhai's The Well of the People (1943),
Mahasweta Devi's Jal/Water (1976), and
Vinodini's Daaham/Thirst (2005)

Abstract
The essay examines India's journey from "colonialism" to "post-colonial awareness." It also explores the ideals of the Republic
and their fulfillment as seen in India as a nation founded on the principles of a welfare state. Discussion of three selected texts
explores the connections between water management and social welfare to instantiate the obstacles in India's aspirations
as a functioning welfare state as well as narrativizing resistance built in the interstices of society against caste hegemony and
power politics. One instance is access to or denial of the life-sustaining element, water. Interestingly, Rabindranath Tagore's
1922 play Muktadhara/Free Current conveyed a percipient warning about politics of control over water. The chosen texts,
Sarabhai's The Well of the People, Mahasweta Devi's Jal/Water, and Vinodini's Daaham/Thirst, besides highlighting the politics
of "hydro power," also portray the deep and mystical relationship between water, ecology, and gender. I argue that India as
a welfare state would obviously benefit from gender sensitization of its developmental policies, especially regarding water
management if women's views are taken into serious consideration.

in charge. From this political condition, an inference is often
drawn that only those people who need not struggle for daily
subsistence so have sufficient time to spare, become politi-
cally active. In other words, the wealthy are often seen as the
class establishing a republican form of government.
Apprehension of such class-dominated polity was appar-
ent in ideologues like E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker or "Periyar"
(1879-1973) who sought to defend the Rights of Dravidians
againstAryans, especially Brahmins, and organized the "Self-
Respect Movement" for Dravidian Upliftment; Jyotirao Phule
(1826-1890) who proclaimed the dawn of a new age for the
downtrodden and wanted to reconstruct the social order on
the basis of social equality and justice for shudras and ati-
shudras (lowest in caste hierarchy); and Bhimrao Ramji
Ambedkar (1891-1956) who fought against the caste system
and declared that "it is wrong to say that the problem of the
untouchables is a social problem . . . [this] is fundamentally a
political problem of minority versus majority groups" (1946,
p. 190) and launched a revolutionary movement for the lib-
eration and advancement of Dalits. The Periyar­Phule­
Ambedkar thrust represents an effort to ensure a more
inclusive representation in the political body of the "imag-
ined" republic. Perhaps the reluctance of Sir Syed Ahmad
Khan to join the Congress can be interpreted as minority
community's fear of majoritarian domination in the formula-
tion of a nation-state. Thus, one becomes aware of the differ-
ences, complexities, and debates during the Swadeshi
Movement and the Freedom Struggle which governed the
conceptualization of the relationship between nation, culture,
and identity. Sensitive to the political nuances of the time,
Rabindranath Tagore cautioned against ideas built around sin-
gular identities because, as he explained in his monograph
Nationalism (1917), the social and the national must not be
regarded as discrete. He emphasized that social composition
determines a nation's republican character. Therefore, the
task before the formulators of the Constitution of India would
be to create a liberatory document to strengthen and validate
the country's heterogeneity by engaging with the issues of
social-cultural inequalities and exclusions, addressing them,
and thereafter making adequate provisions for their resolution
in the text of the new Republic.
Sensitivity and experience deriving from the Independence
Movement framed the Directive Principles of State Policy,
enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution, defining
rights, duties, entitlements, and social justice that a welfare
state would be committed to providing food, clothing, hous-
ing, education, and medical relief for citizens in need. In
2009, Supreme Court's directive to guarantee education to all
and a midday meal to all schoolchildren led to the Right to
Education Act being passed. The welfare state could hence be
expected to monitor satisfactory outcomes in social policies
to positively and directly affect overall human development.
Yet, anyone who knows India would immediately inter-
ject that despite social welfare schemes launched by succes-
sive governments, any social indicator would easily prove
that the welfare state model has had a disappointing record in
terms of implementation of the schemes for the disprivileged
and marginalized sectors. Problematic management, corrup-
tion, and/or mismanagement of funds are very often the rea-
sons for failure. Indeed, as Upamanyu Chatterjee's (2000)
protagonist Agastya Sen, an administrative officer in the
satirical novel Mammaries of the Welfare State discovers, the
Welfare State is "a mystery within and without and getting
things done is pretty much last on the list of everyone's pri-
orities," reminding one that "Self-interest is the only com-
mandment . . . the rest is waffle" (p. 147).
Admittedly, the transformation of latent thought into
manifest content is a complex process, but what could pos-
sibly cause such mismatch between the vision of a well-
meaning republic and the reality of the life of its citizens?
This essay attempts to read three texts which span the colo-
nial and the "postcolonial" divide to emphasize that the pas-
sage is not an unproblematic one. The colonial times have
passed but neo-colonial practices of subjugation and denial
remain. The texts appear distant from each other--one writ-
ten in English and published in 1943, another written in
Bengali and published in 1986, the third in Telugu appeared
in 2005. Yet, they seem to reflect each other's words/worlds
and together instantiate sociohistorical continuities and
coherence. In Mikhail Bakhtin's (1986) words,
The text lives only when it comes into contact with another text
(with context). Only at this point of contact between texts does a
light flash . . . joining a given text in a dialogue. We emphasize
that this is a dialogic contact between texts. . . (p. 162)
These texts are explored through the lens of gender and
caste with the hope of finding some answers about the mili-
tating issues in the colliding zones of their dialogic contact.
The comparative perspective suggested here is founded upon
the conception of social life as discursively constituted, pro-
duced, and reproduced in situated acts of speaking and other
signifying practices or utterances.
The first text, Bharati Sarabhai's (1943) The Well of the
People, a verse drama published in 1943, is accorded a spe-
cial place in the literary history of India as the first play writ-
ten in English by a woman. She explains the play was
inspired by her experience of the Haridwar kumbh mela in
the spring of 1938 with its "phenomenal gathering of people"
(1) and a true incident reported in the journal Harijan about
an old village woman. Sarabhai is a Gandhian and like emi-
nent novelists Bhabani Bhattacharya and Mulk Raj Anand
allows her faith in the Gandhian principles of self-truth, self-
reliance, and service to permeate her writing. The text bears
the mark of the colonial yoke very clearly. The second text,
Mahasweta Devi's (1997 rpt) play Jal or Water, published in
Bengali in 1976 and in translation in 1986, explores the com-
plicated relationship of the mainstream and the marginalized
"untouchable dome" community and its many deprivations
through the machinations of the "empowered" when their
Mukherjee 3
caste is threatened by the "untouchable" Maghai Dome
known as a water-diviner. He is summoned by the upper
caste to trace water, but once the subterranean stream is
located and a well is dug, his caste is not allowed to draw
water from it for fear of pollution as they eat "fowl and pigs."
The third text, Vinodini's (2005) Daaham meaning Thirst, a
Telugu play published in translation in 2005, is accorded a
special place in Indian literary history being among the first
plays written by a Dalit woman. Vinodini is a social activist
and her activism lends power to the language of daily usage
deployed in the play to depict the deprivations and oppres-
sion of the downtrodden Dalit. The text interrogates India's
claim of being a "postcolonial" state when internal coloniza-
tion and "neo-colonial" mind-set prevails.
Notably, the three texts share another significant feature: the
role of life-generating element "water" manipulated and con-
trolled as an instrument of oppression, hinting at future machi-
nations of the politics of hydropower (see Baruah, 2012). The
texts suggest a deep, almost metaphysical, relationship of water
with women and this bonding acquires a gendered subalternity.
Although subalternity is associated with the lowest socioeco-
nomic classes and castes, the texts depict the social role of
women under patriarchy that relegates all classes of women to
subalternity. Theorists of subaltern studies like Gayatri
Chakravorty Spivak and Ranajit Guha note that the treatment
of gender often transcend class/caste, especially regarding
common concerns such as water, food, shelter, security, and
experience of violence. The trans-class/caste awareness makes
gender evident in various ways. Most significantly for this
essay, the selected texts emphasize the connections between
gender and water as complex, multifaceted, and heterogeneous
reflected in the struggles of those living in the interstices of the
welfare state. Invariably in India as elsewhere, activism for
environmental and water conservation has been led by women,
for instance, the Chipko Movement, Silent Valley and Save the
Forest Movements, Navadanya and Aranyani Movements in
India--all for what Vandana Shiva (1988) calls "reclaiming
Terra Mater" (p. 218) toward well-being of all. On March 26,
1986, activist Medha Patkar who motivated Narmada Bachao
Andolan (Save River Narmada Movement) was arrested for
protesting against Narmada Control Authority's decision to
raise the height of Sardar Sarovar dam without rehabilitating
the displaced villagers. The two dams--Sardar Sarover and
Narmada Sagar--would displace 300,000 people, mostly poor
peasants and tribals, and could cause immense ecological dam-
age through the inundation of forests, including prime habitats
of rare species. There were also doubts, drawn from the experi-
ence of dams elsewhere in the country like the Koyna-Morvi
disaster, protests against Kabini dam in Karnataka, Tehri dam
in Garhwal, Koel-Karo dam in Jharkhand, whether the dams
would fulfill their projected benefits of hydropower, irrigation,
and drinking water. It was widely feared that this project could
also become a human and ecological "development disaster."1
India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru is often cited for
describing dams as "temples of modern India" necessary for
the country's economic growth. Yet, it is Nehru who in 1958
rescinded his view and referred to such projects as "disease of
giganticism."2,3
This essay does not intend a judgmental stance on the
Narmada agitation nor the success of the project but aims to
highlight the discourse generated on the notion of "develop-
ment" (as a Western paradigm and value) that could become
"destructive" for pushing reckless "progress" as has been
discussed for instance by Michael Jacobs (1999) in his essay
on "Sustainable Development as Contested Concept" (pp.
21-45). A grassroots-level activity to harmoniously integrate
local communities and habitat could be far more beneficial
and effective. The issue drew nationwide attention to the role
of res publica premised on an egalitarian society ensuring
welfare of all sections of the people without prejudice or
bias. In Medha Patkar's words,
If the vast majority of our population is to be fed and clothed, then
a balanced vision with our own priorities in place of the Western
modelsisamust.Thereisnootherwaybuttoredefine"modernity"
and the goals of development, to widen it to a sustainable, just
society based on harmonious, non-exploitative relationships
between human beings and between people and nature. (http://
www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/speech/acceptance-speech-
medha-patkar-and-baba-amte-narmada-bachao-andolan)
Echoing such sentiments, Vandana Shiva emphasizes the
role women can and should play in water management. She
writes in her discussion of "Women and theVanishingWaters"
(Shiva, 1988, pp. 171-217),
Water management has been transformed from the management
of an integrated water cycle by those who participate in it,
particularly women, into the exploitation of water with dams,
reservoirs and canals by experts and technocrats in remote
places, with masculinist minds . . . the masculinist mind, by
wanting to tame and control every river in ignorance of nature's
ways, is in fact sowing the seeds of large scale desertification
and famine. (Shiva, 1988, pp. 176, 184)
Although the knowledge gained through research and
praxis is yet to enter and enrich public discourse in a notewor-
thy way, critiques of the conventional water management
methods, particularly with regard to environmental/ecological
values, are becoming louder. Indeed, while women as "water
experts" (p. 197) often have primary and informal responsibil-
ity of managing water in many societies, men tend to wield
greater control over water use, and are often overrepresented
in formal decision-making bodies associated with farming,
fishing, and other agricultural activities. In areas where wom-
en's roles or the impact upon them are more tangible, such as
river basins and catchment management, or climate change or
sudden environmental changes, gender issues associated with
water resources have received relatively more attention.
As has been argued by Ruth Menzein-Dick and Margreet
Zwarteveen (1998) in their essay on "Gender Participation
4 SAGE Open
and Water Management," "it is problematic to assume the
existence of a `natural' (or essentialist) relation between
women and nature . . . and requires thinking across and
beyond stereotype bipolar hierarchies" (p. 176). However,
they also acknowledge that examined empirically "the links
between gender and community have direct consequences
for the efficiency and sustainability of natural resources as
well as for the livelihoods of people who depend on those
resources" (p. 176) and can be achieved at substantial levels
by female participation. Several streams of thought tracking
future trajectories of feminist explorations as, for example,
the loosely defined term hydrofeminism have nuanced think-
ing about the closeness of gender and water, while eschew-
ing the essentializing tendency of biological or reproductive
morphology (for theorization of "hydrofeminism," see
Neimanis, 2012). Required is a gradual and increasing need
for participation in people-friendly sustainable and gender-
just projects. The obvious benefit is sensitization to the ear-
lier gender-blindness of water development discourses and
practices, as the matter of women's participation in policies
regarding water management. At the level of policy formula-
tion, the Dublin Statement on Water and the Environment
adopted the following:
Principle No. 3--Women play a central part in the provision,
management and safeguarding of water . . . Acceptance and
implementation of this principle require positive policies to
address women's specific needs and to equip and empower
women to participate at all levels in water resources programs,
including decision-making and implementation, in ways defined
by them. (ICWE 1992:4 cited by Menzein-Dick and Zwarteveen,
1998, p. 178)
Indeed, making "gender" a central concern in water man-
agement in the so-called "developing nations" is a critical
need. The useful roles women can play in managing the eco-
nomic infrastructure both within and outside the homestead,
dealing with water-related matters, are being acknowledged
as a welcome contrast to the way gender distinctions under-
valued women's work, contributions, and knowledge. In
India, drawing and saving water and performing water-
related chores pose daily challenges for women who act as
informal but primary water managers, carriers, end-users,
and family health educators. Women also play significant
role in water management outside the household as in agri-
culture (household gardens and laboring), irrigation, fishing,
and other forms of water-based economic activities, and the
conservation of water in general. Water is used in highly
gender-specific ways in rural and urban societies, at home
and in farms, for food processing and local cottage indus-
tries. Women often develop considerable understanding
about water; its availability, quality, and reliability; its
restrictions; and acceptable storage methods through the
roles they perform in daily activities. Such knowledge can be
utilized or prioritized while making plans for water utiliza-
tion. In her illuminating essay titled "Gendered Water,
Poisoned Wells," Farhana Sultana (2006) highlights the
deeply inflected "socio-ecological relationships" (pp. 363-
364) of women especially with rivers and other sources and
bodies of water which would be enriched by their views on
policy matters on water management and related impacts.
She bemoans that "gender and water literature does not ade-
quately deal with the role of the state and other powerful
agents of development" (p. 366). Indeed, such a discourse is
yet to acquire the seriousness it deserves.
The three texts taken up for discussion probe the relation-
ship between individuals and society, more specifically, exam-
ine welfare measures for catering to basic human needs
through the lens of gender and caste. Interestingly, all three
texts highlight women's grasp of the social agency of "water"
as a practical welfare indicator. The masculinist nature of
knowledge and understanding of "water" is problematized as
is the nature of gender-neutral scholarship on the subject.
Sarabhai imagines India in terms of its multitudes and presents
the panorama of Haridwar and Varanasi river-front against the
backdrop of the Himalayas. River Ganga that came down as
an answer to Bhagirath's prayers in mythic times and contin-
ues to succor people of the cities and towns that crowd her
banks and millions of pilgrims who worship her daily is pre-
sented as symbolizing "the confluence of time" (16)
the river of India, beloved of her people, round which are
intertwined her memories, her hopes and fears, her songs of
triumph, her victories and her defeats . . . a symbol of India's
age-long culture and civilization, ever changing, ever flowing,
and yet ever the same Ganga. (51)
Echoing Nehru, Sarabhai (1943) writes,
I see India with the accumulations of different and heavily
developed civilizations . . . Full cycles of cultural entities turn
and dip, fall and rise again in time which is continuous like the
Ganga . . . the many steps of synthesis and the burden, accepted
by her naturally, without bitterness and without opposition, as
the season of old age approaching the stages of life is assimilated
by women of this country. (Preface, 4)
From this central symbol of hoary multilayered civiliza-
tion emerge both the structure and the theme of the play (2).
With the movement of the river and the stasis of the Himalaya
framing it, a choric mood is aroused as the play opens at
Haridwar teeming with pilgrims, and returns to it coda-like
at the end. In the interim, action shifts to a village where a
conflict--the "struggle between the traditional devotee and
the practical unconscious mystic" (9)--is acted out.
The opening scene shows the river glimmering in the twi-
light. A temple adorned with golden pitchers is visible on its
bank and the Himalayas tower in the background. This is the
picturesque Rishikesh where Ganga reaches the plains to
begin her long journey through the northern expanse.
Midstage holds a cyclorama of shadowy figures of old
women--ancient, huddling forward, seated at a loom. These
Mukherjee 5
shadowy figures form the Chorus (9) filling the narrative
gaps in the drama. Three young persons, Chetan, Sanatan,
and Vichitra, stand in the foreground gazing at the river and
the cyclorama. The metaphorical naming of the characters as
Chetan (consciousness), Sanatan (hoary), and Vichitra (vari-
ety) emphasize the coexisting aspects of Indian culture. They
are enthusiastic "national worker volunteers" (23) and serve
as catalysts for the essential argument embodied in the play.
Cued by Vichitra, the Chorus begins the graphic and evoca-
tive recital of the different kinds of people from across the
country crowding the banks of Ganga, importuning her
grace, immersing themselves, worshipping the life-nurturing
waters so "the sacred river become(s) a bed for all, enough a
bundle and a pitcher" (11). Foreshadowing the dramatic
development, an old woman appears:
Fixed in aloofness she is--an aged woman
Holding her own in day's trumpeting crowd,
Herself an island truncated on edge . . . a pebble forgotten
Safe on the side. (13)
The figure of the old woman influences the ethos of the play
from the very beginning, with the opening cyclorama. Who is
this woman, they wonder; is this "she for whom we work and
live?" (15) (a suggestion of "Bharat Mata" in pre-Independence
India)? They learn she is left behind in the village because she
did not have enough money and later was too old to accompany
the villagers on pilgrimage. They also wonder what these pil-
grims hope to attain by looking into the "maya kunda" (the
pool of illusion) (51) that they readily sell their belongings to
reach the banks of Sur Ganga? (17). Echoing the wisdom of
ages, a sonorous Voice appeals to the "sleeping souls":
Why do you go to Haridwar, to Kashi Varanasi,
O my soul, when I am within?
Pilgrim, pilgrim why, what is it you seek outside? . . .
There is nothing but water at your holy bathing places . . .
The golden antelope runs on seeking; the priceless
musk laughs, laughs within.
The bee in a cave of the petal's vermilion;
fragrance donning her anklet flies . . .
Says Kabir, the weaver of Benares . . .
dear sadhu, I laugh when I hear that the fish in water is thirsty.
(17-18)
Twilight changes to daylight, indicating the passage of
time. Pilgrims return home and the scene shifts to their vil-
lages. Nothing is changed; life goes on as before, showing
grim circumstances of living and the struggle for survival.
The villagers remain a collective--unnamed and amorphous.
But in their song is encapsulated the history of the people who
were born in a land of plenty but were slowly pulverized "like
blades of flower before a mower" (25) into poverty and pow-
erlessness first by oppressors among themselves and then by
the exploitative colonizer the British, "the new usurer, trader,
collector, administrator" (26). Bearing the message of change
came Gandhi into their midst. He appealed to them to be self-
sufficient and to look at themselves through his eyes:
He gave his eyes to them that day. Their eyes
Blinded with pain saw the Hindu outcaste
Harijan, banned of man, like lonely chatak
(The rain-thirsty eternally thirsty bird),
Crying for water of equal men. (43)
The young and the old were enthused by Gandhi's call for
freedom and equality and like Sanatan, Chetan and Vichitra
join his programs for village upliftment. The old woman
inspired by Gandhi's message, embraced the outcaste chil-
dren. She sat at her loom, wove cloth, and saved money for a
pilgrimage to Benares. Her story is narrated by the Workers
(33-37):
It is now time we speak for her whose life
Was dumb. She is you, you and all of us . . . (33)
She is Rani and has worked with them for 20 years,
"Come late at end of each long day and stand/Upon twilight
that winds her cowdust through/The scattering basket of sun-
set harvest" (33). She came from Madhubani in Bihar, a
beautiful girl of the Maithili Brahmins who marry their
daughters young. It was said that it was not unusual to see
whole village of widows--the result of child brides married
to much older men. Rani too was a child widow who lost her
relatives and was left to fend for herself. In her blood was the
art of weaving and she sat at her spinning wheel, "her body
waning miniature like shadow cast/by candle light" (36)
(noteworthy is charkha or the spinning wheel as the Gandhian
symbol of self-reliance). And thus, "She went on living. She
lived to set apart/Crystal from rock, gold from dross . . ."
(36). She saved money--shining silver coins, imagined her-
self "a pilgrim star upon the western end of life," each coin a
step "On the path to golden walled God-appareled temple of
Benares/Lotus seat of Tathagata at Sarnath . . . " (36), as
through her pilgrimage, her husband, and ancestors will
6 SAGE Open
attain salvation (37). But when she saved enough, she had a
broken leg. No pilgrim group would take her along, "Not
even for life's money? She wept, she begged, she promised.
All her love/Was it enough?--No, it was not enough" (37).
As Chetan, Vichitra, and Sanatan listen to her story, the old
woman enters, mutters as though alone: "I could not go"--
(39) . . . then declares: "I want to build a temple well!" Adds,
I may not see Benares. God does not
Push a sick vessel like this body to
Each port of earthly pilgrimage, always
To stop and fill, still stop and fill to full . . .
But my soul, my free swan, can bring inland
On a small well, with water pure as
Mother Ganga, the merit lost. . . .
Before I die, people who pray may drink
At my well . . . (41)
Rani acquires agency. No longer a seeker of illusory ben-
efits from a pilgrimage to Ganga, she is instrumental in
bringing Ganga to her village, thus changing the condition of
life of the villagers. Through self-realization, instead of seek-
ing personal salvation she arranges "salvation" for her peo-
ple and her enterprise becomes the meaningful legacy for
posterity. Her words resonate through the final lines of the
play to uphold the idea of Ganga as prakriti/nature and
shakti/power--the two facets of femaleness now synony-
mous with the old woman who, in trying to build a well,
would actually enable the subterranean stream (Ganga) to
rise to the surface for people's welfare. W. T. S Thakara
(1994) comments on how rivers are regarded in India:
. . . They (the rivers) evoke an image of spiritual-intellectual
energies cascading through the manifold planes of cosmic and
individual life, linking us intimately with our spiritual source,
nourishing and sustaining us, and flowing forth to connect us
with all things . . . For sacred rivers are not only mythic reminders
of forgotten truth, they represent the ever-present stream of who
and what we essentially are: not a static being, but a dynamic
ever-becoming flow of godlike radiance . . . (http://www.nw.org/
theosnw/world/general/my-wtst1.htm)
The closing lines of the play seem to echo such senti-
ments: "O how/Great India's torrent has been turned outward
from/Lonely river and mountain!" (48), when, reflective of
the message of truth that rivers carry, the individual wish (the
old woman's lifelong wish to go on a Ganga pilgrimage) is
subsumed by her realization of the need of the many--a well
for the village.
Sarabhai's play also makes apparent a dialectical representa-
tion of the nature­human relationship. Although autonomous
nature exists outside human endeavor, human agency tries to
control nature ostensibly for "larger good" often exacerbating
disaster. It is worth noting that politics over control of water is
gaining ground with the grim awareness that future wars may be
fought for water. In this context, a fascinating intertextual refer-
ence is Rabindranath Tagore's remarkable play Muktadhara
[Free Current] which also highlights a conflict, the struggle
between tyrannical power and collective welfare, a text Sarabhai
may have read. Tagore's 1922 play anticipates with uncanny
perspicuity how water management could become a key to
power relations and social and political dispute, as has become
increasingly evident in contemporary times. The concern with
water is not new. Hindu sacred texts, the Vedas, describe Indra
defeatingVritra, a demon, who held back the river waters behind
stone dams. Water, beyond its practical use as commodity, also
suggests a complicated set of cultural values which makes it a
multivocal symbol (Turner, 1974) and can absorb within it
many references and unites them into a single cognitive and
affective field which can propel social action. A multilayered
and a deeply symbolical text, Muktadhara's plot revolves
around the harnessing of a river at higher altitude of Uttarakut
by its king planning to dominate the people of Shivtarai by con-
trolling the flow of the water into their valley. He intends to use
the water for other purposes. In a stark contrast to the Nehruvian
idealized metaphor of river dam as a "temple of progress,"
Tagore presents it as a menacing machine that is antinature and
antifreedom, of controlling nature and dominating the land-
scape, and susceptible to the ideas of oppression and despotism.
Reflecting an understanding of a typically colonial enterprise,
Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt (2006) writes in her essay on "Nadi O Nari:
Representing the River and Women":
. . . Instead of treating the rivers as avenues of prosperity, the
colonial notion was to control them, treating the rise and fall of
their waters as aberrant and uncivil. By the end of nineteenth
century, the idea of transforming rivers into natural engines to
drive the machines of the industrial world had transplanted itself
on the muddy and sticky soils of the delta . . . The colonial vision
of rivers did indicate an understanding of the rivers' power, but
also demonstrated that they were being utilized to no conceivable
end, and were unprofitable to them. (388)
Tagore's play opens with the impending imprisonment of
the prince for being sympathetic toward the oppressed peo-
ple of the valley. Shivtarai people are restive but lack the
initiative for open revolt. Into the crisis enters the enigmatic
Dhananjay Bairagi, a mendicant and minstrel, a free spirit
who bows to no bondage. He comes with a song on his lips:
I shall sail the seas of injury
through the terrible storms
in my fear-dispelling little boat . . . [translation: mine]
Mukherjee 7
Bairagi's inspiring leadership and clarion call for freedom
combined with Prince Abhijit's spirit of sacrifice propel the
popular uprising against oppression. Bairagi's advice that
"waves do not subside when one hits them; one must hold the
stern of the boat with firm hands to steer it through the tem-
pest" is obviously a call to fight all forms of hegemony and
establish social-political conditions to ensure the well-being
of the larger populace.
That colonialism did not--and has not--disappeared
with the departure of the British from India is demonstrated
by the two texts: Mahasweta devi's Jal and Vinodini's
Daaham. The plots of the plays are similar and derive from
contextualized indigenous domains. Both recount stories of
discrimination and denial of basic human necessities as food
and water suffered by the so-called casteless/untouchable
people. The poor and untouchable Dalits are used as labor to
dig wells for the rich upper castes but are refused access to
the same. The plays portray the interstices of social life and
the failures of the welfare programs of a republic. Devi's
play Jal is set in village Charsa named for the river flowing
by it. The river overflows every monsoon, yet the untouch-
ables--Domes, Chamars, and Chandals--experience severe
shortage during dry seasons every year as there is neither
water storage nor other water bodies they can access. Many
die as the relief material sent by the government is stolen by
the village headman Santosh. Additional worry is police sor-
ties pursuing escaped Naxalites. The police camps in the
area despite Santosh's assurance that there is no trouble
except the untouchables clamoring for water. Exhausted
with their daily struggle for water and food supplies, villag-
ers demand to be allowed to draw water from the Panchayat
well or dig another well. They are refused both. The women
declare:
Phulmani: Daughters, mothers, sisters! Let's go and beg from
our co-wife, the river.
First woman: Is the river Charsa your co-wife?
Phulmani (in a dry wail): My co-wife! . . . The river's a woman,
she feels for us, that's why she yields water . . . Come sisters let's
pray for water. . . .
Women: [singing] Give us water!
Water, water, water!
The sky drips with molten fire.
The land gasps for water
Where oh where is water? . . . (105-6)
Rivers in India (as in other ancient cultures) are configured
as feminine, are given feminine identities, and are treated as
potent symbols of power and fecundity, at once hope-giving
and nourishing or terrifying and destructive. The river-bed is
like a womb that can generate and revive life. Rivers in flood
sweep away villages, and are worshipped and feared. Bengali
literature begotten of riverine imaginary is replete with such
genderedmetaphorsoftheriver(e.g.,ManikBandyopadhyay's
Padma Nadir Majhi; Adwaita Mallabarman's Titash ekti
Nadir Naam; Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay's Hansuli Banker
Upakatha; Samaresh Basu's Ganga etc.).An intriguing image
provided by Tarashankar is of the river as unruly and wild like
a low-caste girl:
. . . From the beginning of the monsoons, the motherless young
girl grows up. Her body fills up with youthfulness. Then
suddenly one day she turns into a witch. Like one of the low
caste, a Kahar girl, suddenly turning savage, shouts at her
parents, family and neighbours and leaves home, her hair flaring
around her face, her clothes disheveled, roaming the village
streets, spreading fire with her eyes, running amok . . . Again,
two or four days later, she calms down within her banks, just as
the Kahar girl comes back home, singing a tune. (cited in Lahiri-
Dutt, 2006, p. 403)
As Lahiri-Dutt explains, the wild behavior of the river
reflecting the free living style of the lower class adds to the
gendering of the river and the nuances of caste, class, and
behavioral codes. Similarly, the image of River Charsa
invoked in Jal is of such a free woman, often described as a
seductive and flirtatious whore. Maghai Dome, the water-
diviner, possessing intuitive power to locate the subterranean
stream prides himself as the descendant of "Bhagirath of the
nether-Ganga" (the mythical sage who summoned Ganga
upon Earth with his penances) and recounts the story of Earth
hiding a portion of Ganga in her womb that can be coaxed to
the surface only in response to the summons of the mythical
Bhagirath's descendants:
Maghai: The water lies captive deep down till it gushes out at
Mother's bidding
O water, to whom do you belong?
I belong to him who knows how to call me.
Now who calls you?
It's Maghai who calls me.
And who's Maghai?
He's slave to the one who keeps me slave.
Whose bidding is it?
It's the bidding of the Mother, the nether Ganga. . . . (116)
Maghai nurtures lifelong love for River Charsa as the
manifestation of nether Ganga. When the rains come and
Charsa is in spate, Maghai stands entranced upon her bank:
8 SAGE Open
Maghai: . . . how gloriously beautiful you appear my Charsa!
Yes my girl, go dancing all the way, dance, dance, ah, my darling
life blood!
. . . Such a beautiful wench, in the monsoons of June and July
she breaks across the banks, she laughs with bursts of flood,
Charsa the youthful river . . . Dhura's mother is right. You're a
whore, a fallen woman. In the summer months when I scrape at
your breasts how you flirt with me. You sing to me: The water
won't be easy to get, I've kept the water hidden deep under.
You've to scratch at my breasts before I let it loose not to you but
your wife and daughters. . . . (125)
The village schoolteacher Jiten finds Maghai talking to
the river. Jiten suggests they dam the excess flood water for
use through the year. The villagers, convinced of the good
sense, build the dam to store excess flood water soon find to
their delight a fine tank of water for their use. Maghai
announces that Jiten's empathy and concern made him one of
them:
Maghai: . . . You became a Dome when you found us threatened.
You became a Dome when you took up the issue of our school.
You became a Dome when you gave us the dam . . . The dam is
the proof that you are the true Bhagirath of the holy mother, the
nether Ganga. I've divined water but I've not been able to give
a drop to my mothers, sons, fathers, brothers. The dam that
you've given us will quench the thirst of all my people. (135)
Acknowledging Jiten as the "true Bhagirath," Maghai
caricatures his own posturing and vanity as the water-diviner.
He expresses deep regret for not appreciating the river's
bounty despite his love for her. He finally understands the
river had always been available to them as a perennial water
source. He is ashamed for betraying her love by calling her a
whore whose love is short-lived or seasonal. Maghai and his
people also realize the importance of self-help instead of
depending on charity of the so-called relief dispensers of the
State.
The crisis of the play grows out of upper caste fear of the
Domes becoming self-reliant, the threat that by managing
natural resources they can challenge the game of power. So,
they collude with the police and attack the village, ostensibly
staging a Naxalite "encounter." Their anger is directed at
Jiten for supporting the Domes. Jiten is hit in the head by the
butt of a gun during the fight and Maghai trying to save him
is fatally shot. The waters of Charsa roar in flood and the
dam breaks. People watch in awe as the river sweeps Maghai
away.
Like Jal, Vinodini's Daaham/Thirst is a poignant repre-
sentation of the daily struggles of the untouchable/Dalit for
survival without food and water. A Dalit Mala community
resides at the village periphery and ekes out life in dire pov-
erty, oppression, and exploitation, discriminated against by
the prosperous upper caste. The play opens as Souramma
returns home beaten by upper caste women when unable to
bear thirst any longer she "dared" to go to the village well to
draw water. Souramma reports:
. . . I went in the morning with the pitcher and stood near the
well. Not even a single bitch gave me water. It was getting late.
My legs ached. How long could I wait? I asked every woman
who came to the well . . . amma, pour one pitcher of water into
my vessel . . . I pleaded with them . . . not even a single bitch
listened to my pleas. The sun was scorching. I couldn't stop
myself. I went up to the well and tied the rope, that's all. Then all
of them came running, broke my pitcher, pulled me down from
the well and beat me up. (493)
Although Dalit labor is used to dig wells, the "polluted"
Dalits are not allowed to even touch the pulley to draw water.
Souramma's act becomes a serious breach of social norm. To
maintain the oppressive exploitative hierarchy and prevent
the recurrence of such incidents which might give the Dalits
ideas about "equality" and "rights," it is imperative that such
action is immediately and harshly suppressed. Dasu is
shocked to learn that killing Dalits perceived as rebellious
nonconformists is not uncommon and has been resorted to
before. Dasu's uncle who was a fearless social rebel had been
thus dispensed with. The issue escalates. There is lot of dis-
cussion as to what course of action should be taken in
response to the summons of Pedda Reddy, the upper caste
village headman and leader of Panchayat.Adivision becomes
apparent among the Malapalli Dalits. While the group of
elders is cautious and fearful, subservient and obsequious in
attitude, the group comprising younger generation Dalits
some of whom are educated is unwilling to tolerate any form
of unfair dominance. Present in the latter group are women
whose daily struggles have pushed them to the limit of for-
bearance. The second group resolves not to succumb to any
abuse or threat and assumes an aggressive stance to demand
equal rights to natural resources.
When the Dalits come to the village center for the meet-
ing, Souramma's son Dasu identifies himself as the new
spokesperson of the Malas instead of the Elder Pedda Mala
as was the earlier custom. The upper caste village headman
Pedda Reddy demands that Dalits pay a fine of 10,000 rupees
because Mala Souri broke the norm and touched the pulley
of the well. Her act is a grievous one because as a conse-
quence, Ganga has been polluted and might recede and cause
the well to dry up. Mala youth are not intimidated by threats
nor accept such reasons. They refuse to pay the fine and
answer every abuse and threat with collective aggression.
They argue that Ganga answered their call and rose to the
surface when they dug the well, why should she disappear
now? Amid heated exchange, a maid from the landlord's
house comes to urgently summon Gangi who has been
breastfeeding Younger Reddy's newborn son as the mother's
breasts had not yielded any milk. Despite much pleading,
Gangi refuses to go until their problem is resolved. Dalits
react strongly to Younger Reddy charges:
Mukherjee 9
Venkata Reddy: (To Gangi's husband) You fellows, are you
human beings or what? See, you don't allow Gangi to go though
the child is suffering. And you talk of morals, morals!
Prasad: Your child, one child, born day before yesterday . . .
makes you feel so bad when he cries for milk. Were you bothered
ever when so many of us along with our children thirsted for a
little drinking water? Not one day but for years altogether? Did
you think of us or our babies even once?
Pushpamma: We served food for our children and waited for
hours near the well for one pitcher of water and that nobody
from your caste had the time to pour. And nobody gave water,
we went home with empty pitchers. How many times we were
beaten up by our husbands for not getting water to drink? Did
you feel for us when our throats were dry? . . . When you didn't
give water we walked ten miles and brought dirty water from
puddles--the bathing water for dogs, pigs and cattle--and drank
that. (496)
The Domes of Charsa built a dam to solve their water
problems, the Malas of Malapalli demand their right to use
the village well which they had dug. Replicating the practices
of a capitalist state instead of a social welfare state that India's
republican ideals vouchsafe, Dalits, subalterns, and the poor
are exploited as labor and/or commodities--for hard labor or
for breastfeeding the babies of the rich (a memorable text
exemplifying this is Mahasweta devi's "Stanadayini"/The
Breastgiver) yet are denied the fruit of their labor, are dis-
criminated against and forced to accept unequal and arbitrary
caste/class rules. Hence, when basic amenities are appropri-
ated by a section of the people to deny others, it is time for the
distressed to acquire agency and recall the Gandhian mantra
of collective dissent and noncooperation to be able to shape
and protect their future. Thus, to quench the "thirst" of the
Reddy baby, the rich and the powerful of the village are forced
to acquiesce the Dalit demand for the use of the well water to
quench the "thirst" of their community.
It is significant that the dominating image that all the texts
carry is that of "water" in relation to human life: as the agent
of purification and life-sustaining element. The texts also
emphasize the close yet practical relationship of women with
water. While the old woman wants a well for the people,
Dalit women want to access the wells their men have dug.
Also made apparent in the three plays, as in the play by
Tagore, is the perception and use of water as socially con-
structed with cultural implications, which in turn determine
the way water politics can operate in different contexts,
revealing the relationship between those who use it and those
who supply/control it. Emphasizing this point, Lahiri-Dutt
(2006) writes that water is "subjectively constructed, or `pro-
duced' like any other element of nature; a part of the cultural
landscape, rooted in history, both the producer and product
of the material culture through which human agency is
enacted" (p. xvii). Evidently, as reflected in the texts, the
closest relationship water has (itself "gendered") is with
women, the archetypal water carriers, and validated as such
through symbols and icons. This is especially true of the
Third World societies where the burden of household chores
and the responsibility of fetching and carrying water often
from distances rest upon women. Using water and perform-
ing water-related chores constitute a daily challenge for
women who thus become "informal but primary water man-
agers, water carriers, end-users and family health educators"
(Lahiri-Dutt, 2006, p. xx). Thereby, women gain consider-
able knowledge and insights about availability, quality, and
storage of water. As argued above, policy planning for water
resource development and management would greatly bene-
fit with the participation of women.
Together, the texts record the complexity of human life
implicated in "developmental" history. Such "histories" have
rendered the project of nation-state governance particularly
open to counter representations and resistance. Yet, regretta-
bly, such discourses do not appear to occupy the mainstream
politics of the Welfare State as much as they should and are
generally relegated to the in-between spaces of social inter-
action. As illustrated by the texts, lives in the in-between
spaces, in the interstices of the society, enact resistance to
hegemony and power play in the society. Such articulation of
difference from the perspective of the disprivileged is a com-
plex and continuous negotiation that take shape during
moments of historical transition or transformation and that
political empowerment and the enlargement of the cultural
space come from posing questions about community and
identity from such interstitial perspectives.
India remains a republic struggling with manifold layers
of social exclusion and must confront processes of internal
colonization and address the systematic or de facto processes
of denial of entitlements, based on class, caste, clan, gender,
tribe, language, and religion--factors that are often bundled
with location. Resources of the country must be equitably
shared. Exclusion is experienced at all levels of society, at
the regional, community, interpersonal, and intrapersonal
levels that hinder the consolidation of an egalitarian civil
society. The essay tries to show a text's genesis in a sociohis-
torical situation from which nontextual social "truths" are
interpreted. The three texts perform several tasks. They com-
prise a political and social discourse from interstitial per-
spectives as reminders of the founding principles of a
Republic. They serve as mediators between the governmen-
tality of the state apparatus and the lives of a vast number of
people that remain untouched by the so-called "developmen-
tal" policies. The texts also emphasize the need to "listen" to
these voices with ethical sensitivity to move toward a truly
decolonialized condition to be able to fulfill the vision of a
Republic.

Notes
1. There is vast literature on issues concerning damming of rivers
in India. See Jean Dreze, Meera Samson, and Satyajit Singh
(1997); Satyajit Singh (1997); Ranjit Dwivedi (2006); Sanjay
Sangvai (2000); Baviskar (1995); The Second Citizens'Report
(1996); Uma Maheswari (2006).
2. Rescinding his 1958 euphoric statement, Nehru, J.N. quoted in
Joshi etc, "For some time past, however, I have been beginning
to think that we are suffering from what we may call, `disease of
gigantism'. We want to show that we can build big dams and do
big things. This is a dangerous outlook developing in India . . . the
idea of having big undertakings and doing big tasks for the sake
of showing that we can do big things is not a good outlook at all."
Quoted by Prashant Bhushan in his blog on Water Community,
May 15, 2008: blogspot.in/2008/05/disease-of-gigantism.htm
