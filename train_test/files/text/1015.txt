Context: An understudied crucial step in the help-
seeking process is making prompt initial contact with a
treatment provider after first onset of a mental disorder.
Objective: To provide data on patterns and predictors
of failure and delay in making initial treatment contact
after first onset of a mental disorder in the United States
from the recently completed National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication.
Design and Setting: Nationally representative face-
to-face household survey carried out between February
2001 and April 2003.
Participants: A total of 9282 respondents aged 18 years
and older.
Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime DSM-IV disor-
ders were assessed with the World Mental Health (WMH)
Survey Initiative version of the World Health Organiza-
tionCompositeInternationalDiagnosticInterview(WMH-
CIDI), a fully structured interview designed to be admin-
istered by trained lay interviewers. Information about age
offirstprofessionaltreatmentcontactforeachlifetimeDSM-
IV/WMH-CIDI disorder assessed in the survey was col-
lected and compared with age at onset of the disorder to
study typical duration of delay.
Results: Cumulative lifetime probability curves show that
the vast majority of people with lifetime disorders even-
tually make treatment contact, although more so for mood
(88.1%-94.2%) disorders than for anxiety (27.3%-
95.3%), impulse control (33.9%-51.8%), or substance
(52.7%-76.9%) disorders. Delay among those who even-
tually make treatment contact ranges from 6 to 8 years for
mood disorders and 9 to 23 years for anxiety disorders.
Failure to make initial treatment contact and delay among
those who eventually make treatment contact are both as-
sociated with early age of onset, being in an older cohort,
and a number of socio-demographic characteristics (male,
married, poorly educated, racial/ethnic minority).
Conclusions: Failure to make prompt initial treatment
contact is a pervasive aspect of unmet need for mental
health care in the United States. Interventions to speed
initial treatment contact are likely to reduce the bur-
dens and hazards of untreated mental disorder.

RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY
shows that a high propor-
tion of people with preva-
lent mental disorders in the
United States are untreated
despite their disorders causing substantial
distress and impairment, and despite ef-
fective treatments being available.1-5 It is of
considerable public health importance to
uncover modifiable reasons for this lack of
treatment. Successful treatment requires
people suffering from the disorder to take
a sequence of steps in the help-seeking pro-
cess.6,7 A critical early step is establishing
initial contact with a health care provider
following first onset of the disorder. Rela-
tivelylittleisknownaboutpatternsandcor-
relates of this early phase of the help-
seekingprocessbecausemostmentalhealth
services research focuses on recent treat-
ment of current episodes rather than ini-
tial treatment of incident cases.8-14 The few
studies that have examined the latter con-
sistently document 2 important facts15-21:
that despite low current treatment of preva-
lent cases, the vast majority of lifetime cases
eventuallymaketreatmentcontact;andthat
it typically takes quite a number of years
after first onset of the disorder for initial
treatment contact to occur. The baseline
National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), for
example,estimatedthatapproximately80%
of all people in the United States with a
mental disorder eventually seek treat-
ment, but that the median delay between
first onset of the disorder and first treat-
ment contact is nearly a decade.18-21 Stud-

ies of delay in initial treatment contact in other devel-
oped countries have found similar results.19,20
In the decade since the baseline NCS was carried out,
important changes have occurred in the following catego-
ries: public attitudes and awareness of mental disorders,
clinical diagnostic procedures, the availability of psycho-
tropic medications and evidence-based psychotherapies,
and the organization and financing of mental health
care.22-41 Unfortunately, the current extent and timing of
initial treatment seeking is unknown. The current report
addresses this issue by analyzing data from the recently
completedNationalComorbiditySurveyReplication(NCS-
R).42 We began by constructing cumulative lifetime prob-
ability of treatment contact curves to estimate the current
lifetime probability of treatment contact for mental dis-
orders and the typical duration of delay. We then exam-
ined socio-demographic predictors of failure and delay in
making initial treatment contact. Because recent changes
in awareness and management have not occurred uni-
formly across disorders, with mood disorders in particu-
lar receiving considerable attention,25 we examined the ex-
tent and predictors of failure and delay separately for each
of the core disorders assessed in the NCS-R.
METHODS
SAMPLE
As described in more detail elsewhere,43,44 the NCS-R is a nation-
ally representative, multistage clustered area probability sample
of English-speaking respondents aged 18 years and older in the
noninstitutionalized civilian population of the 48 coterminous
states. Fieldwork was carried out by the professional survey in-
terview field staff of the Institute for Social Research at the Uni-
versityofMichigan,AnnArbor,betweenFebruary2001andApril
2003. A total of 9282 face-to-face interviews were completed. All
respondents were administered a part I diagnostic interview of
core diagnoses. A subsample of 5692 part I respondents, consist-
ing of all those who met lifetime criteria for a core disorder plus
a probability subsample of other respondents, were also admin-
istered a part II interview that assessed correlates and disorders
of secondary focus. The response rate was 70.9%. Interviewers
explained the study and obtained verbal informed consent prior
to beginning all interviews. The NCS-R recruitment, consent, and
field procedures were approved by the Human Subjects Com-
mittees of both Harvard Medical School, Boston, and the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment
Diagnoses of DSM-IV disorders were made using the World
Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative
version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(WMH-CIDI),44,45 a fully structured lay-administered diagnos-
tic interview that generates diagnoses according to the defini-
tions and criteria of both the ICD-1046 and DSM-IV47 diagnostic
systems. Criteria for DSM-IV disorders are used in the current
report. The disorders considered in this report include (1) mood
disorders, including major depressive episode (MDE), dysthy-
mia (DYS), and bipolar disorder (BPD) I and II studied together
for increased statistical power; (2) anxiety disorders, including
panic disorder (PD), agoraphobia without panic (AG), specific
phobia (SP), social phobia (SoP), generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD),posttraumaticstressdisorder(PTSD),andseparationanxi-
ety disorder (SAD); (3) substance disorders, including alcohol
abuse(AA),alcoholdependence(AD),drugabuse(DA),anddrug
dependence (DD); and (4) impulse control disorders, includ-
ing intermittent explosive disorder (IED), oppositional defiant
disorder (ODD), and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD).Lifetimeprevalenceandageofonsetwereassessedsepa-
rately for each disorder.44 It is noteworthy that obsessive-
compulsivedisorder(OCD)andconductdisorder(CD)werealso
assessed in the NCS-R and are included in separate reports in
substantive analyses, but are not included in the current report
because the sample of cases was too small for powerful analysis
of OCD. This was because OCD was a secondary disorder as-
sessed in only a fraction of the part II subsample and because
age of first treatment seeking was not assessed for CD. All diag-
noses are considered with organic exclusions and without diag-
nostichierarchyrules.AsdescribedbyKessleretal,44 ablindclini-
cal reappraisal study using the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV (SCID)48 showed generally good concordance between
DSM-IV diagnoses based on the WMH-CIDI and the SCID for
anxiety, mood, and substance disorders. The WMH-CIDI diag-
noses of impulse control disorders have not been validated.
Treatment Contact
Near the end of each WMH-CIDI diagnostic section, respon-
dents were asked whether they ever in their life talked to a medi-
cal doctor or other professional about the disorder under in-
vestigation. In asking this question, the interviewer clarified
that the term "other professional" was meant to apply broadly
to include psychologists, counselors, spiritual advisors, herb-
alists, acupuncturists, and any other healing professionals. Re-
spondents who reported ever talking to any of these profes-
sionals about the disorder in question were then asked how old
they were the first time they did so. The response to this ques-
tion was used to define age of first treatment contact.
Predictors
Predictor variables include age at onset of the focal disorder
(coded into the categories 0-12, 13-19, 20-29, and 30 or more
years of age), cohort (defined by age at interview in the cat-
egories 18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60 or more years), sex, race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
and other), education (categorized as either current students
or nonstudents with 0-11, 12, 13-15, or 16 or more years of
education), and marital status (categorized as either currently
married/cohabitating, previously married, or never married).
The last 2 of these predictors vary within a given individual
over time. Information was obtained in the NCS-R on timing
of marital histories (ie, ages at marriage and marital dissolu-
tion), allowing marital status to be coded for each year of each
respondent's life. Information on years of education was also
coded as a time-varying predictor by assuming an orderly edu-
cational history for each respondent in which 8 years of edu-
cation corresponds to being a student up to age 14 years and
other lengths of education are associated with ages consistent
with this benchmark (eg, 12 years of education is assumed to
correspond to being a student up to age 18 years).
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
The data were weighted to adjust for differential probabilities of
selection of respondents within households and differential non-
response as well as to adjust for residual differences between
the sample and the United States population on the cross-
classificationofsociodemographicvariables.Anadditionalweight

zwas
used in the part II sample to adjust for differences in prob-
ability of selection into that sample. These procedures are de-
scribed in more detail by Kessler et al.43 As most disorders con-
sidered here were assessed in part I, cumulative probability of
lifetime treatment contact curves were estimated using part I
data and weights whenever possible. Part II data and weights
were used for disorders that were assessed in part II (PTSD, ODD,
CD, and ADHD). Survival analysis was used to make estimated
projections of cumulative lifetime probability of treatment con-
tact from year of onset. The actuarial method,49 implemented in
the Statistical Analysis System version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC),50 was used rather than the more familiar Kaplan-Meier
method51 of generating survival curves because the former has
an advantage over the latter in estimating onsets within a year.
Separate curves were generated for each disorder. The typical du-
ration of delay in initial treatment contact was defined as the me-
dian number of years from disorder onset to first treatment con-
tact among cases that eventually made treatment contact based
on these curves. Time to initial treatment contact in the subset
of respondents with BPD was defined as the duration of time from
the initial onset of a manic or hypomanic episode to first treat-
ment of a manic or hypomanic episode. Treatment for MDE in
the course of BPD was not considered because the current analy-
ses only focused on treatment seeking for specific syndromes and
notforcomorbidconditions.Discrete-timesurvivalanalysis52 with
person-year as the unit of analysis was used to examine corre-
lates of treatment contact separately for each disorder. Predic-
tors included both time-invariant predictors (age at onset of the
disorder, cohort, sex, race/ethnicity) as well as several time-
varying predictors (number of years since first onset of the dis-
order, education, marital status). Each model was estimated twice
for a given disorder: once among all respondents with a history
of the disorder to study the predictors of ever making a treat-
ment contact; and then a second time among the subsample who
eventually made a treatment contact to study the predictors of
delay in initial contact. The Taylor series linearization method53
implemented in the SUDAAN software system54 was used to ad-
just for the effects of the weighting and clustering of the NCS-R
data on significance tests. Multivariate significance tests in the
discrete-time survival analyses were made with 2 tests using
Taylor series design-based coefficient variance-covariance ma-
trices. Statistical significance was consistently evaluated using
0.05 level, 2-sided tests.
RESULTS
CUMULATIVE LIFETIME PROBABILITIES
OF TREATMENT CONTACT
Survival curves were used to make projections of the pro-
portion of cases who will eventually make treatment con-
tact for each disorder assessed in the NCS-R. These pro-
portions are estimated to be 88.1% for MDE, 90.2% for
BPD, and 94.2% for DYS (Figure 1), with no statisti-
cally significant differences in the survival curves of the
individual disorders in this class (2
2
=0.7; P=.72). Pro-
jected proportions are much more variable for anxiety
disorders (Figure 2) and are 27.3% for SAD, 50.1% for
SoP, 50.1% for SP, 65.3% for PTSD, 66.5% for AG, 86.1%
for GAD, and 95.3% for PD, with statistically significant
differences in the survival curves of the individual dis-
orders in this class (2
5
=242.4; P.001). Projected pro-
portions for impulse control disorders (Figure 3) are
33.9% for ODD, 50.4% for IED, and 51.8% for ADHD,
with significant differences in the survival curves of the
individual disorders in this class (2
2
=6.0; P=.05). Pro-
jected proportions for substance disorders (Figure 4)
are 52.7% for AA, 57.0% for DA, 69.8% for AD, and 76.9%
for DD, with significant differences in the survival curves
of the individual disorders in this class (2
3
=44.8; P.001).
DURATION OF DELAYS
IN INITIAL TREATMENT CONTACT
The survival curves were also used to estimate the pro-
portion of cases that made treatment contact in the year
of first onset of the disorder and the median delay among
people who eventually made treatment contact after the
year of first onset (Table 1). The proportion of cases
that made treatment contact in the year of disorder on-
set ranges from highs of 37.4% to 41.6% for the mood

Median years of delay also differ greatly across disor-
ders, from lows of 6 to 8 years for mood disorders to highs
of 20 to 23 years for SP and SAD.
PREDICTORS OF FAILURE
AND DELAY IN INITIAL TREATMENT CONTACT
Predictors of failure to ever make a treatment contact
among respondents with a given lifetime disorder
(Tables 2-4) are very similar to predictors of duration
of delay among respondents who eventually made treat-
ment contact. The most consistent predictors of failure
to make a treatment contact are cohort and age at onset.
Cohort is significantly related to lifetime treatment con-
tact in 14 of 17 comparisons (0.05 level, 2-sided tests),
with the dominant pattern being for treatment contact
to increase in more recent cohorts. This pattern is even
stronger (17 of 17 comparisons) in predicting delay in
treatment contact among eventual patients. Age of on-
set is significantly related to treatment contact in 15 of
17 comparisons, the exceptions being 2 childhood-
onset disorders (SAD, ADHD), with a consistent pat-
tern of increasing treatment contact with increasing age
at onset. A very similar pattern (17 of 17 significant com-
parisons) is found in predicting delay in treatment among
eventual patients.
Sociodemographic predictors are less consistent.
Women have significantly higher odds of treatment con-
tact than men for 4 of the 17 outcomes (MDE, DYS, BPD,
SoP), while men never had higher odds than women for
any outcome. Sex differences are even weaker (1 of 17
comparisons significant) in predicting delays. Race/
ethnic differences are significant in 8 of 17 compari-
sons, with non-Hispanic whites always having higher odds
of treatment than 1 or more minority groups. This pat-
tern is weaker in predicting delays (5 of 17 comparisons
significant), even though there are some cases in which
minorities have significantly shorter delays than non-
Hispanic whites. Education is significant in 8 of 17 com-
parisons, but the pattern of the association varies con-
siderably across outcomes. The most consistent element
in the pattern is that students generally have higher odds
of treatment than people who have completed their edu-
cation. This is quite different from the pattern with re-
spect to delays among eventual cases (10 of 17 compari-
sons significant), where college graduates generally have
the shortest delays. Finally, marital status is significant

in 5 of 17 comparisons, with never married respondents
consistently more likely and previously married people
sometimes more likely than married people to make treat-
ment contact. A similar pattern (7 of 17 comparisons sig-
nificant) exists in predicting delays among people who
eventually make treatment contacts.
COMMENT
The results reported here should be interpreted in light
of 5 potential limitations. Perhaps the most concerning
is the possibility of recall failure of lifetime events. If re-
spondents who did not seek treatment were more likely
either to forget or to normalize symptoms than respon-
dents who received treatment, leading to a false-negative
reportoflifetimedisorder,theprevalenceofdisorderwould
be underestimated and the probability of eventual treat-
ment contact would be underestimated. We have no way
ofevaluatingthispossibility,althoughitisnoteworthythat
in such a case the estimate of the raw number of people
with a disorder who had significant delays in initial treat-
ment contact would be conservative.
A second possibility is that despite accurate reports
of disorders and treatment contacts occurring, dating was
inaccurate. As discussed in more detail by Kessler and
Ustun,45 special efforts were made in the NCS-R to help
respondents recall age at onset and age at initial treat-
ment contact by asking questions that focused memory
search and bounded recall uncertainty.55 Although it is
unclear how remaining dating errors would affect re-
sults, telescoping (recalling past experiences as having
occurred more recently than they actually did occur) is

the most likely type of error, which would lead to down-
ward bias in estimates of delays.56
Third, the NCS-R questions about initial treatment con-
tact provide no information about whether treatment was
actually obtained or, if so, about the nature, intensity,
or adequacy of these treatments. We also did not distin-
guish between contacts made in health care vs nonÂ­
health care sectors, as we have done in previous analy-
ses of the original NCS.21 As a result, the findings presented
here should be interpreted as upper bounds on the pro-
portions of these cases that received treatment and lower
bounds on the typical durations of delays until treat-
ment was received. Furthermore, some meaningful pro-
portion of treated cases received treatment that did not
meet minimal standards for treatment adequacy.5 Even
though we have no way of pinpointing the specific cases
that received inadequate treatment at the point of initial
treatment contact, we know that the proportions of cases
projected to make eventual treatment contact are greater
than the proportions that obtain adequate treatment.
Fourth, predictors of failure and delay in initial con-
tact were necessarily limited to ones that could be ret-
rospectively dated. In the socioeconomic domain, for ex-
ample, we considered the effects of educational attainment
but not of income, as we had no information about each
respondent's income in each year of his or her life. In ad-
dition, we limited predictors to variables for which a priori
hypotheses have been raised.18-21 Although categories of
some predictors (eg, ages at interview and disorder on-
set, education) were kept broad so as to contain suffi-
cient cases, we still may have lacked the statistical power
to identify important differences (eg, between racial and

recognize that even though our outcomes were failures
and delays in initial treatment contacts, the estimated ef-
fects of the predictors represent amalgamated effects on
a number of steps in the help-seeking process that lead
up to making an initial treatment contact, such as be-
coming aware of the disorder, perceiving need for treat-
ment, and accessing care.
Finally, we cannot conclude with certainty how pat-
terns and predictors of failure and delay have changed over
the past decade because the current report on the NCS-R
differsfromearlieranalysesoftheoriginalNCS18,19,21 interms
of disorders, covariates, and outcomes examined. Even
subtle differences between analyses (eg, use of diagnostic
hierarchy rules) could have important effects. Exploring
temporal trends between the NCS and NCS-R remains an
important area for future research.
With these limitations in mind, our results docu-
ment 2 types of unmet need for mental health treatment
in the United States. First, a large number of people never
make treatment contacts for the DSM-IV/WMH-CIDI dis-
orders evaluated in the NCS-R. This is especially true for
substance and impulse control disorders, where nearly
half of all lifetime cases failed to make any treatment con-
tact. Consistent with the finding regarding substance dis-
orders, previous research has shown that people with sub-
stance disorders often do not perceive a need for treatment,
actively resist treatment, and do not seek treatment un-
til their disorders have become highly debilitating.9,57,58
The low proportion of cases that ever seek treatment for
impulse control disorders could reflect the perceptions,
both on the part of the people with the disorders and of
society at large, that their problems are less relevant to
the mental health care system than to other systems (eg,
social services, education, criminal justice). Although im-
pulse control disorders can be highly distressing to oth-
ers, they are often associated with more externalization
and less internal dysphoria for cases, resulting in less mo-
tivation for afflicted individuals to seek treatment. The
facts that these disorders have only recently become rec-

ognized as DSM disorders and that treatments are only
beginning to emerge are other likely contributing fac-
tors to the low rate of treatment of impulse control dis-
orders.47,59,60
The second source of unmet need for mental health
care documented in the NCS-R concerns pervasive de-
lays in initial treatment contact. The typical delays docu-
mented here persist for years or even decades for some
disorders. This has not been a focus of previous re-
search, as mental health services research has tradition-
ally focused on treatment of current episodes for estab-
lished cases.8-14 This focus led naturally to a concern with
lack of treatment rather than with treatment delay. The
NCS-R findings suggest that this focus needs to be ex-
panded, as eventual treatment is the typical state of af-
fairs for most of the disorders considered here, while de-
lay in initial treatment seeking is pervasive.
Substantial inter-disorder variation was found both in
the probability of eventually making treatment contacts
and in typical durations of delay. The pattern of this varia-
tion is quite consistent with the pattern found in previ-
ous studies of initial treatment contact.18-21 The finding
of initial treatment contact being higher and delays shorter
for mood disorders than other classes of disorders may
be because of the fact that mood disorders have been tar-
geted by educational campaigns, primary care quality im-
provement programs, and treatment advances.25,26,28,31,61
The prominent and dysphoric somatic symptoms often
found in conjunction with panic disorder may account
for the finding that treatment contact is more common
and occurs more quickly for panic disorder than other
types of anxiety disorder.62,63 Greater failure and delays
for some anxiety disorders such as phobias and SAD could
be because of their generally early age at onset, fewer as-
sociated impairments, and even fear of providers or treat-
ments involving social interactions (eg, talking thera-
pies, group settings, waiting rooms).9,12,64
Shorter delays and higher proportions of cases with
eventual treatment contact in more recent cohorts pro-
vide grounds for optimism, as they provide some evi-
dence that patterns of help-seeking have improved in the
recent past. This secular change could be, in part, be-
cause of recent programs that destigmatize and increase
awareness of mental illness, screening and outreach ini-
tiatives, the introduction and direct-to-consumer pro-
motion of new treatments, and expansion of some in-
surance programs,22-41 although a more fine-grained
mapping of time series information would be needed to
document effects of specific initiatives. Drug depen-
dence is a notable exception to the general pattern of in-
creased treatment in recent cohorts. There are both longer
delays and fewer initial contacts in younger cohorts than
older ones. Whether this is the result of methodological
(eg, failure to capture contacts with self-help groups which
now play increasingly important roles in the treatment
of substance disorders) or substantive processes is un-
clear, although one might expect methodological fac-
tors to have effects that emerged more consistently across
the full range of conditions. To the extent that the pat-
tern is substantive, it might be because of changes in fund-
ing of drug treatment programs, changes in public atti-
tudes toward drug dependence, or a combination of those
factors.65-67 Given the importance of timely drug treat-
ment, more detailed investigation is warranted.
We found that early-onset disorders are consistently
associated with longer delays and a lower overall prob-
ability of initial treatment contact. The same pattern has
consistently been found in previous studies of delays in
initial treatment contact.18-21 Minors may be less likely
to receive timely treatment because they need the help
of parents or other adults and recognition is often low
among these adults unless symptoms are extreme.68,69 In
addition, child- and adolescent-onset mental disorders
might be associated with normalization of symptoms or
the development of coping strategies (eg, social with-
drawal in social phobias) that interfere with help-
seeking during adulthood. The paucity of available or ac-
cessible child mental health services may also be an
important factor.
Men have been shown in earlier research to be slower
than women at translating nonspecific feelings of dis-
tress into conscious recognition that they have emo-
tional problems, perhaps explaining the NCS-R finding
that males sometimes have longer delays and lower rates
of treatment contact than women.70,71 The longer delays
and lower odds of ever making treatment contacts found
among minorities compared with non-Hispanic whites
are broadly consistent with findings in earlier studies that
minorities often receive suboptimal mental health care,2,3,12
but we are not aware of any previous research that ex-
plicitly examined race/ethnic differences in initial treat-
ment contact. Negative attitudes toward treatment on the
part of minorities could play an important part in ac-
counting for these results.72 However, the fact that the
race/ethnic differences in delays and eventual treatment
vary substantially across outcomes suggests that more than
broad attitudinal factors are likely to be involved. Greater
knowledge and financial resources to pay for treatments
could help explain the positive associations between edu-
cation and initial help-seeking for many mental disor-
ders; on the other hand, greater help-seeking for sub-
stance disorders by those less educated could reflect their
greater acceptance and lower financial barriers to addic-
tion services, many of which are self-help groups.73 Dif-
ficulties forming or maintaining relationships and lack
of social support from a partner may be strong impe-
tuses for those not married to rapidly seek mental health
treatments.6,12
It is important to consider whether the delays and fail-
ures to make initial treatment contacts truly pose a pub-
lic health problem. An alternative view is that they may
only characterize less severe, short-lived, or nondebili-
tating mental disorders.74 However, research in the base-
line NCS data showed that many people with even se-
vere and impairing disorders reported substantial delays
in initial treatment contact.21 Long periods of untreated
illness may also be harmful to those with less severe dis-
orders. Preclinical studies suggest that neural "kin-
dling" can cause untreated psychiatric disorders to be-
come more frequent, severe, spontaneous, and treatment
refractory.75 In addition, epidemiological studies sug-
gest that school failure, teenage child-bearing, unstable
employment, early marriage, marital violence, and mari-
tal instability are associated with early-onset untreated

mental disorders.76-79 Recent randomized clinical trials
have shown that treatment can prevent suicidality.80 Fur-
thermore, most people with 1 disorder progress to de-
velop comorbid disorders and such comorbidity is asso-
ciated with an even more persistent and severe clinical
course.81,82 However, it should be kept in mind that not
all studies have found a relationship between the dura-
tion of untreated mental illness and long-term out-
comes.83 Definitively answering whether reducing treat-
ment delays would prevent such negative outcomes
requires long-term trials of aggressive outreach and treat-
ment of new cases. Such trials are just beginning to be
carried out.84-86
Despite the absence of definitive data from such long-
term outreach treatment trials, the findings reported here
suggest that more effort is needed to increase prompt ini-
tial treatment contacts among people with incident epi-
sodes of mental disorders. Additional large-scale public
education programs (eg, the NIMH Depression, Aware-
ness, Recognition, and Treatment program) and ex-
panded use of National Screening Days continue to hold
great promise for hastening detection and treat-
ment.23,31,68 School-based screening programs using brief
self-report and/or informant scales may be needed to de-
tect early-onset mental disorders.87,88 Demand manage-
ment and other outreach strategies could also help re-
duce critical delays and failures in initial help-seeking once
mental disorders are identified.89,90 Training nonÂ­
health care professionals to recognize individuals with
mental disorders and make timely referrals for health care
should also be explored.30,91,92 A range of interventions
may ultimately be needed to alleviate the burdens and
hazards from untreated mental disorders.
