Antigenic Stimulation and
Multiple Myeloma
A Prospective Study
Claire C. Bourguet, Ph.D., and Everett E. Lope, PhD.
Background. A causal relationship between anti-
genicconditions and multiple myeloma was suggestedby
case reports. Although controlled studies identified asso-
ciations with individual conditions, they failed to give
overall support to the hypothesis. Using a prospective co-
hort representative of the U.S. population, the authors
hypothesized that immune-stimulating conditions are a
risk factor for multiple myeloma.
Methods.TheFirst National Health andNutrition Ex-
amination Survey cohort of 14,407 persons were inter-
viewed from 1971 to 1975 by the National Center for
Health Statistics. Vital statuswith causeof death andhos-
pitalizations were ascertained from 1982 to 1985 and in
1986. From the initial questionnaire, four risk factors
were constructed allergies (asthma, hives, hay fever,
food allergies, and other allergies); autoimmune condi-
tions (arthritis, thyroid disease and/or medication, rheu-
matic fever, diabetes, pernicious anemia); chronic bacte-
rial conditions (chronic bronchitis or emphysema,
chronic cough, tuberculosis, ulcers); and inflammatory
conditions (gout,gallstones, recurrent or chronic enteri-
tis, pleurisy).
Results. Eighteen multiple myeloma (MM) cases
were documented. The rate ratio (RR)
of MM increased as
the number of reported inflammatory conditions in-
creased (onecondition,RR = 2.0,95%0confidenceinterval
[CI]= 1.2-3.3;2 or more conditions, RR = 4.3,95% CI =
1.5-12.4).The RR of myeloma also increased (P= 0.0002)
with time since start of inflammatory conditions (RR =
1
.
6 for every 10years of exposure). When cases were re-
stricted to those with more than five years of follow-up,
myeloma risk increased with the number of inflamma-
tory conditions (two conditions, RR = 4.6,95% CI = 1.5-
13.8).

and exposure may be misclassified, the prospective na-
ture of the study design strengthens the results of the

Multiple myeloma is a malignant neoplasm of plasma
cells. The monoclonal origin of malignant plasma cells
is accepted on the basis of the homogeneity of the se-
creted immunoglobulin.w There is increasing evidence
that the initial malignant transformation occurs in a cell
that is a precursor to both B-lymphocytes and T-lym-
phocytes. Multiple myeloma develops in a multistep
process starting with a monoclonalgammopathy of un-
determined significance, a benign proliferation of
monoclonal cells. In some patients, monoclonal gam-
mopathy of undetermined significance progresses to
symptomatic multiple myeloma.' Etiologicfactors gov-
erning the initiation and subsequent progression to
clinically apparent myeloma remain unknown.
A causal relationship between antigenicconditions
and multiple myeloma was originally suggested on the
basis of case reports that identified concurrent disease
in myeloma case^.^-^ Although controlled studies have
identified associations with individual conditions that
cause chronic or recurrent stimulation of the immune
system, they have failed to support a unified mecha-
nism.
Severalcase-control studies of the antigenicstimu-
lation hypothesis of multiple myeloma have relied on
hospital-based controlgroups. Thesecontrolgroupsare
susceptible to selection factors that may mask a true
association of myeloma with other medical conditions.
In the current study, we used the First National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANESI) cohort
to examine prospectively the hypothesis that chronicor
Antigenic Stimulation and Multiple Myeloma/Bourguet and L o p e 2149
recurrent conditions that stimulate the immune system
are risk factors for multiple myeloma.6
Methods
The data for the study comefrom the NHANESIEpide-
miologicFollow-upStudy, which was conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics. The NHANES I
cohort consists of a probability sample of the civilian
noninstitutionalized U.S. p~pulation.~,'
The NHANES I baseline questionnaire was com-
pleted from 1971to 1975during face-to-faceinterviews
with each study member. Two waves of follow-up data
were subsequentlycollected,the firstfrom 1982to 1984
and the second in 1986.At both follow-up waves, vital
status was determined and death certificates were ob-
tained for deceased cohort members. Living cohort
members or proxies were reinterviewed.
In the 1982-84 follow-up, 14,407participants, age
25 to 74 years at the time of the NHANES I, were con-
tacted. Cohort members or a proxies responded to a
2-hour personal interview.' In 1986, 3,980 cohort
members age 55 years or older at the initial interview
and who were still alive at the 1982-84 follow-up were
contacted. A half-hour telephone interview was con-
ducted with each member.'
At the time of the follow-up interview, each cohort
member or proxy was asked to list all episodesof hospi-
talization. Respondents authorized release of medical
records to the National Center for Health Statisticsfor
the purposes of the Details of the hospitaliza-
tion, including the discharge summary, were requested
from each hospital.
For the current study, the hospitalization data and
the death certificate data were used to identify the
members with multiple myeloma. All diagnoses listed
for each hospitalization and all cause-of-death codes
were searched for International Classification of Dis-
eases code 203 (MM).Date of hospitalization for multi-
ple myeloma was used as the best available surrogate
for date of diagnosis. If date of hospitalization was not
available, date of death was used.
The NHANES I(l971-75) questionnaire included a
standardized medical history covering various topics.
The health-condition list was used to construct four a
priori categories of conditions that result in chronic or
recurrent stimulation of the immune system:(1)allergic
conditions-asthma, hives, hay fever, food allergies,
and other allergies;(2) autoimmune conditions-arthri-
tis, rheumatic fever, diabetes, thyroid disease and/or
medication, and pernicious anemia; (3) chronic bacte-
rial conditions-tuberculosis, chronicbronchitis or em-
physema, chronic cough, and ulcers; and (4)inflamma-
tory conditions -gout, gallstones, pleurisy, and recur-
rent or chronic enteritis. The interview ascertained the
presence of each disease condition at time of interview,
a history of a condition no longer present, and the time
since the person first had the condition. The Appendix
shows the questionnaire items that were used to con-
struct each category.
To control for confounding factorsby age and year
of birth and to reduce computer processing time, we
restricted the data analyses to cohort members who
were born in the same study years as the persons with
multiple myeloma. Crude incidence rate ratios (RR) as-
sociatedwith a history of allergic,autoimmune, chronic
bacterial, or inflammatory conditions were calculated.
Incidence RR and 95% confidence intervals adjusted
for potential confounders were estimated using a pro-
portional hazards model by means of the PHGLM pro-
cedure in the SAS (Cary, NC) statistical software.","
For the data analysis, the risk factors were struc-
tured to indicate a disease category present at any time
before or at the time of interview, present at the time of
the interview,and total timesinceinitiation of the medi-
cal conditions in the category. Although all persons
with myeloma had denied any malignant tumor at the
baseline interview, the possibility of prevalent my-
eloma at the time of interview exists. Consequently, the
data were reanalyzed after restricting the cases to those
persons who had 5 or more years of follow-up after the
baseline interview.
After two waves of follow-up, 94% of the cohort
had been traced and their vital status was known.
Ninety-seven percent of the death certificateswere ob-
tained for the 2,657 cohort members who had died.
From 1982 to 1984, 93% of the surviving respondents
were interviewed, and in 1986, 97% of the survivors
were reinterviewed.'
The completeness of the hospitalization data can
only be estimated, because cohort members may have
reported hospitalizations that did not fall within the
eligiblefollow-up period. However, from 1982to 1984,
no hospital record was obtained for 22% of persons
who reported at least one hospitalization.**'*
In 1986,
the hospital records could not be obtained for 28% of
the reported hospitalization episodes.'
Results
Eighteen cases of multiple myeloma were found in the
NHANES I cohort. Nine cases were identified by both
hospital and death records, eight cases by hospital re-
cords only, and one case by death certificateonly.

intervals indicated that the higher myeloma rates
among women and nonwhites may have been pro-
duced by random variation. A grammar school educa-
tion was associatedwith an elevated RR (RR = 6.6,P <
0.01).Educationwas included in subsequent mathemat-
ical models as a potential confounder. Because of the
year-of-birth restriction in the study design, age was
not a predictor of myeloma risk in these data.
Table 3 shows the incidence RR for multiple my-
eloma associated with a cohort member's report that he
or she had ever had one or more of the grouped anti-
genic conditions. Inflammatory conditions showed a
statisticallysignificant association(P < 0.01)of increas-
ing RR with increasing number of conditions. Allergies
and autoimmune conditions showed a dose-response
relationship. These associations, however, were not
statistically significant. Chronic bacterial conditions
were inversely associated with multiple myeloma risk,
although the association was compatible with random
variation (P = 0.17).
Parallel data analyses were conducted using, as the
indicator of exposure, the cohort member's response
that he or she had the condition at the time of the
NHANES I interview. The pattern of association was
similar to that shown in Table 3, although the strength
of the associationswas reduced due to the smallernum-
ber of persons reporting current disease. The incidence

(one condition, RR = 1.6; two conditions, RR = 2.7;
P = 0.04).
Table 4 shows the reported length of time since the
cohort member initially suffered from the condition.
This exposure variable only approximates duration of
exposure, because there is no information that a condi-
tion was present continuously after initiation. Com-
pared with other cohort members, the mean timessince
initial exposure reported by persons with myeloma
were longer for allergic, autoimmune, and inflamma-
tory conditions.Forinflammatoryconditions,there was
a statistically significant increase (P = 0.0002) in risk
with increasing time since first exposure (RR = 1.6 for
each additional 10years sincethe start of the inflamma-
tory condition).
Four personswith myelomahad been firsthospital-
ized for multiple myeloma within 5 years of the inter-
view. One person was diagnosed with myeloma within
1 year of the interview. Because undiagnosed disease
may have been present at the interview, these four
cases were excluded and the analyses were repeated.
The associationof inflammatoryconditionswith multi-
ple myeloma risk was strengthened (one condition, RR
= 2.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-3.7; two condi-
tions, RR = 4.6,95%confidenceinterval = 1.5-13.8). In
this analysis, an RR of 1.9 (P = 0.001) was associated
with an inflammatory condition initiated 10 or more
years before the interview.Theassociationwith allergic
conditions was also strengthened, although it was not
statistically significant (one condition, RR = 2.2; two
conditions, RR = 4.9; P = 0.39).In this analysis,neither
bacterial nor autoimmune conditionsshowed an associ-
ation with myeloma.
Discussion
Previousstudiesof the antigenicstimulationhypothesis
for the etiology of multiple myeloma are difficult to
interpret. Prospective data have been reported from the
rheumatoid arthritis cohort of Isomaki et al.13and from
the Adventist Health Study.14 Koepsell et al." and
Doody et a1.16reported population-based case-control
data. Other reports come from hospital case-control
studies.
''-"
Prospective studies have found an association of
multiple myeloma with specific medical conditions.
Isomaki et al. found twice the expected incidence of
multiple myeloma in a rheumatoid arthritis cohort.13
The relative risk of myeloma after a history of any al-
lergyin the Adventist Health cohort was l.7.However,
this was not a statistically significant in~rease.'~
McWhorter examined the incidence of combined
lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma in a subset of the
same NHANES I cohort used in the current study. He
found an increased incidence of these neoplasms
among patients who had a history of allergy.23
McWhorter's data involves follow-up up to 1984 only
and is limited to an examination of allergies as a risk
factor. The risk of myeloma is not reported separately,
presumably because only a small number of cases had
occurred at the first wave of follow-up.
Two population-based case-control studies pro-
vide little support to an etiologic role of chronic anti-
2152 CANCER October 1, 1993, Volume 72,No. 7
genic stimulation. Koepsell et al., using cases from the
Surveillance,Epidemiology,and End Results Reporting
system and population-representative controls, found
little support for the hypothesi~.'~
Of many potential
risk factors, associations with fever blisters, urinary
tract infections, and rheumatic fever were found.
Doody et al. concluded that their data from a Kaiser
Permanente cohort did not support a role for chronic
antigenic stimulation in the etiology of hematopoietic
malignancies. They did, however, find an elevated risk
of myeloma with a history of eczema or musculoskele-
tal condition.'6
Boffetta et al. reported a case-control study nested
within the American Cancer Society prospective co-
hort. They found an associationof myeloma only with
diabetes among eight conditions examined. Although
these exposuredata were collectedbefore diseasedevel-
opment, the cohort consisted of volunteers who may
have been self-selectedinto the study accordingto per-
ceived health statusz4
Hospital-basedcase-control studieshave givenlim-
ited support to the antigenic stimulation hypothe-
sis.17-22 However,becauseof the selectionphenomenon
known as Berkson bias," hospital-based case-control
studies are unsuitable for assessingan association with
preexistingmedical conditions. If the presence of multi-
ple clinicalconditionsincreasesthe probabilityof hospi-
tal admission, the hospital-based control group will
have a higher prevalence of concurrent disease condi-
tions than the background population. As a result of
this selectionprocess, a true association of multiple my-
eloma with other conditionsmay be masked in a hospi-
tal-based case-control study.
In the current analysis of data from the NHANES I
cohort, we found evidence of increased risk of multiple
myeloma among persons who reported at baseline in-
terview that they had suffered from autoimmune or
inflammatory conditions. The primary strength of the
data results from their prospective nature. Data col-
lected for a prospective cohort avoid the problems of
selectionbias associated with hospital-based case-con-
trol studies. Theyalso avoid biased recall by the patient
and interviewer bias, which can occur when a patient
with a known condition is interviewed.
These findings are not conclusive. The results are
based on only 18multiple myeloma cases. Because the
actual date of diagnosis was unavailable, the date of
hospitalization or, for one case, date of death was sub-
stituted. The risk factorcategories had to be constructed
from the data that had been collected at the baseline
interview. Therefore, the disease conditions that were
included in the analysis are not a definitive list of dis-
eases in each category.
Because the baseline data were collected for an-
other purpose, a single questionnaire item could com-
bine conditions with differing etiologies. For example,
although only rheumatoid arthritis is thought to have
an autoimmune component, the NHANES I item
would include rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. The
questionnaire item "arthritis" was included in the au-
toimmune categoryon the assumption that osteoarthri-
tis would be randomly distributed between cases and
controlsand that, if an associationwas seen, it would be
due to rheumatoid arthritis. Chronic or recurrent enter-
itis was thought to represent Crohn disease. Thyroid
disease may represent Graves disease or other autoim-
mune thyroiditis. Both persons with multiple myeloma
who reported thyroid disease also reported takingregu-
lar thyroid medication. Assumptions of this nature,
which may result in misclassification of exposure, in-
troduce a conservativebias by weakening the ability of
the study to detect true associations.
Ten percent of patients with multiple myeloma
may exhibit primary amyloidosis, which can manifest
as amyloid induced arthritis or carpal tunnel syn-
dromeeZ6
When we limited the data analysis to persons
who developed disease 5 or more years after the base-
line interview, the associationwith autoimmune condi-
tions disappeared. This suggests that the elevated rela-
tive risk found for autoimmune conditions present at
the interview may be a spurious result of early disease
symptoms.
Increasedmultiplemyelomarisk was associatedini-
tially with higher educational levels.27
These earlyfind-
ings may have been an artifact of under-diagnosed dis-
ease in less-educated person^.^^,^^ In the current study,
persons with less than a high schooleducationhad a 6.6
times increased risk of multiple myeloma compared
with persons with at least a high school education.
Koepsell et al. and Boffetta et al. also reported
an increased risk of myeloma at lower educational
level^.'^,^^
The biologic mechanism linking lower educational
status with increased myeloma risk remains unclear.
Myeloma has been associatedwith several occupational
and chemical exposure^.^'^^^^^^^^^ These may be more
common among persons with less education and may
explain part of this association.
Boice et al. have recentlyreported anincreasingrisk
of multiple myeloma associated with increasing num-
bers of diagnostic radiograph^.^' Persons at the highest
exposure level (a mean of 35 diagnostic radiographs)
had relative risks of approximately four for multiple
myeloma. Radiographs are used in the differential
diagnosis of virtually all inflammatory conditions and
many autoimmune conditions. Confounding by diag-
Antigenic Stimulation and Multiple Myeloma/Bourguet and L o p e 2153
nostic radiographs could explain part of the association
with immune-stimulatingconditionsseenin the current
study, and the reverse might also be true. Additional
studiesshould be designed to delineate the possible in-
dependent contributions of antigenic conditions and
diagnostic radiographs to the etiology of multiple my-
eloma.
Clearly, allhuman beings are exposedto many an-
tigensdaily.Someof the medical conditionsincluded in
the current study are quite common. Persons who de-
velop multiple myeloma may be characterized by a
unique response to common exposures. The data of
Leech and colleague^,^^ who reported an excess of hu-
man leukocyteantigen-Cw5 amongblack patients with
myeloma, and the numerous reports of family aggrega-
tion of multiplemyeloma3'suggest that genetics play a
role in increased risk. However, it will be a challengeto
determine if genetic characteristics of the individual,
environmentalexposures, or behavioral factorsinteract
with relatively common antigenic stimulation to place
the individual at risk.
The data reported here, drawn from a nationally
representative prospective study, show an association
of inflammatoryconditionswith multiplemyeloma. In-
flammatory conditions show a dose-response relation-
ship with number of conditions and time since initial
inflammatory condition. These findings give limited
support to the role of chronic stimulation of the im-
mune system in the etiology of multiple myeloma. Be-
cause only a smallnumber of myeloma caseswere pres-
ent in the cohort, the data lackthe power to detectweak
associations. Consequently, although there were no
consistent associations of allergic, autoimmune, or
chronicbacterial conditionswith multiplemyeloma, no
conclusionsabout those risk factorscanbe drawn based
on these data.
