Reported Consumption of Low-Nutrient-Density
Foods by American Children and Adolescents
Nutritional and Health Correlates, NHANES III, 1988 to 1994
Ashima K. Kant, PhD
Objective: To examine the contribution of foods of mod-
est nutritional value to the diets of American children and
adolescents.
Methods: The data were from the third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988 to 1994, and in-
cluded 4852 children and adolescents, aged 8 to 18 years.
Foods reported in the 24-hour dietary recall were grouped
into the following low-nutrient-density (LND) food cat-
egories: visible fat; table sweeteners, candy, and sweet-
ened beverages; baked and dairy desserts; salty snacks; and
miscellaneous. The independent association of the num-
ber of LND foods mentioned in the recall with intake of
food groups, macronutrients, micronutrients, and body
mass index was examined by means of regression proce-
dures to adjust for multiple covariates.
Results: The LND foods contributed more than 30% of
daily energy, with sweeteners and desserts jointly
accounting for nearly 25%. Intakes of total energy and
percentage of energy from carbohydrate and fat related
positively, but percentage of energy from protein and
dietary fiber (in grams) related inversely to the reported
number of LND foods (P.05). The reported number of
LND foods was a negative predictor (P.001) of the
amount of nutrient-dense foods reported. The mean
amount of reported intake of several micronutrients--
vitamins A, B6
, and folate, and the minerals calcium,
magnesium, iron, and zinc--declined (P.05) with
increasing tertiles of reported number of LND foods.
The LND food reporting was not a significant predictor
of body mass index.
Conclusion: High LND food reporting was related to
higher energy intake but lower amounts of the 5 major
food groups and most micronutrients.

MANY AMERICAN chil-
dren and adolescents
consume diets that
provide marginal
amounts of several nu-
trients, including vitamins A, E, B6
, and fo-
late, and the minerals calcium, magne-
sium, iron, and zinc.1,2 These essential
nutrients have well-known metabolic func-
tions, and many have been linked to health
promotion and disease prevention.3-6 Re-
cent survey data also suggest an alarming
trend in increasing prevalence of adipos-
ity in US children and adolescents.7,8 Es-
timates from the Continuing Survey of
Food Intakes by Individuals, 1994 to 1996,
suggest a dramatic increase in consump-
tion of relatively energy-dense foods of
modest nutrient density.9 The low-
nutrient-density (LND) foods provide
highly palatable energy, possibly at the ex-
pense of foods that are sources of essen-
tial nutrients.10-12 It is tempting to specu-
late that dietary patterns characterized
by excessive consumption of LND foods
may contribute to increased risk of mar-
ginal nutrient intakes and positive en-
ergy balance.
However, there has been no system-
atic, comprehensive study of the extent of
contribution of energy-dense foods of
modest nutritional value to the diets of
American children or the nutritional and
health implications, if any, of their con-
sumption. Past attempts at examining LND
food intake in children have included ex-
amination of the contribution of added
sugar or carbonated beverages to the di-
ets of children.11-18 There is some evi-
dence that food selection patterns fa-
vored in childhood may track through
adult years19; therefore, a better under-
standing of patterns of food consump-
tion is clearly warranted. The purpose of
this study was to examine nationally rep-
resentative data from the third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III, 1988-1994) for con-
sumption of LND foods by 8- to 18-year-
old American children and adolescents.

METHODS
The NHANES III is a multistage, stratified, probability sample
of the noninstitutionalized, civilian US population, aged 2
months and older.20 The survey was conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics and included administra-
tion of a questionnaire at home and a full medical examina-
tion along with a battery of tests in a special mobile examination
center.20 Demographic and medical history information was ob-
tained during the household interview. The examination at the
mobile examination center included physical and dental ex-
aminations, dietary interview, body measurements, and col-
lection of blood and urine samples. Body weight, height, and
circumference at various body sites were measured by stan-
dardized procedures in the mobile examination center.20
DIETARY ASSESSMENT METHOD
A 24-hour dietary recall was collected by a trained dietary in-
terviewer in a mobile examination center interview with the
use of an automated, microcomputer-based interview and cod-
ing system.20 The type and amount of foods consumed were
recalled with recall aids such as abstract food models, special
charts, measuring cups, and rulers to help in quantifying the
amounts consumed. Special probes were used to help the re-
call of commonly forgotten items such as condiments, accom-
paniments, fast foods, and alcoholic beverages.
ANALYTIC SAMPLE
All NHANES III respondents aged 8 to 18 years with a 24-
hour recall considered complete and reliable by the National
Center for Health Statistics were eligible for inclusion in this
study (n=4889). Recalls of pregnant (n=34) or nursing (n=3)
respondents were excluded, to result in a final analytic sample
size of 4852 (2383 boys and 2469 girls) representing a popu-
lation estimate of 38738796 children and adolescents.
ASSESSMENT OF INTAKE OF LND FOODS
To determine the intake of LND foods, it was necessary to iden-
tify foods belonging in this category from those reported in the
24-hour dietary recall. As a first step, the 2578 foods reported
by the analytic sample were classified as belonging to 1 or more
of the 5 major food groups (dairy, fruit, grain, meat, and veg-
etable) or the LND food group by methods described previ-
ously.10,21,22 Briefly, the assignment of foods into the various
groups was dependent on their nutrient content and uses in
the diet. The dairy group included milk, yogurt, cheese, and
buttermilk, but excluded butter, cream cheese, and dairy des-
serts. The fruit group included all fresh, frozen, dried, and canned
fruits and fruit juices, but excluded fruit drinks. The grain group
included all breads, cereals, pastas, and rice, but not pastries.
The meat group included meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and meat
alternates such as dried beans, nuts, and seeds. The vegetable
group included all raw or cooked fresh, frozen, and canned veg-
etables and juices. Mixed dishes containing foods from several
groups were grouped into all the relevant groups. Foods ex-
cluded from these major food groups were grouped into the
LND foods group. The LND foods were further placed into 5
subgroups as follows: (1) visible fat: butter, oil, dressings, gra-
vies, etc; (2) sweeteners: sugar, syrup, candy, carbonated and
noncarbonated sweetened drinks, etc; (3) baked and dairy des-
serts: cookies, cakes, pies, pastries, ice cream, puddings, cheese-
cakes, etc; (4) salted snacks: potato, corn, and tortilla chips,
etc; and (5) miscellaneous: coffee, tea, condiments, etc.
The LND foods variable was operationalized in 3 differ-
ent ways: (1) number of mentions of LND foods and bever-
ages in the recall, (2) amount (in grams) of LND foods and bev-
erages, and (3) percentage of total energy from LND foods and
beverages.
The NHANES III nutrient database for individual foods,
which is derived from the US Department of Agriculture's Sur-
vey Nutrient Database, was used for determining energy and
nutrient content of all foods.23 We examined the mean intake
of selected micronutrients (vitamins A, E, C, B6
, and folate, and
the minerals calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc) by tertiles
of the reported number of LND foods. The reported intake of
each nutrient was also examined with reference to the most re-
cent age-sex­specific standard available, the estimated aver-
age requirement.3-6 As an estimate of dietary misreporting, the
ratio of reported energy intake to energy expenditure for basal
needs was computed. Energy expenditure for basal needs was
estimated by prediction equations developed by the Dietary Ref-
erence Intakes Committee for normal and overweight or obese
3- to 18-year-olds.24
Data on serum concentrations of vitamin C, folate, and ca-
rotenoids were obtained from the National Center for Health
Statistics public release compact disks.25,26 The methods used
for measurement of these serum analytes and their associated
errors have been described.25,26 Serum folate, ascorbate, and the
carotenoids---carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein-
zeaxanthin, and lycopene--were chosen because the dietary in-
take of each nutrient is believed to be a major determinant of
serum concentration of the respective nutrient and can thus
serve as a biomarker of dietary exposure.4,5 Serum homocys-
teine has been reported as an independent predictor of coro-
nary heart disease risk and may have dietary determinants.27,28
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
The number, amount, and proportion of daily energy contrib-
uted by all LND foods and subgroups were computed, and each
LND food variable was examined as weighted tertiles. The mean
daily energy, percentage of energy from macronutrients, and
mean percentage of the population meeting the dietary refer-
ence intake of selected nutrients were obtained by tertiles of
each LND foods variable. The estimates of nutrient and food
group intake were adjusted for age (continuous), race (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other),
sex, family income ($10000, $10000-$29999, $30000-
$499999, $50000, unknown), highest grade of education re-
ported for the family respondent (12, 12, 12, or unknown
grade), and total energy intake (in kilocalories). Adjusted mean
concentration of serum analytes by tertiles of the reported num-
ber of LND foods was obtained separately for boys and girls.
These models were adjusted for age, race, dietary intake of the
relevant nutrient, supplement use in the 24 hours before phle-
botomy, supplement use in the past month, and hours of fast-
ing before phlebotomy.
The procedure used for obtaining covariate-adjusted es-
timates and SEs from survey data is based on Taylor lineariza-
tion methods according to Graubard and Korn.29 All statistical
analyses were performed with SAS30 and software designed for
analysis of survey data (SUDAAN).31 This software generates
variance estimates that are corrected for multistage stratified
probability design of complex surveys. Sample weights pro-
vided by the National Center for Health Statistics to correct for
differential probabilities of selection, noncoverage, and non-
response were used in all analyses to obtain point estimates.20
The independent association of each LND foods variable
with food and nutrient intake was examined by regression pro-
cedures to adjust for covariates mentioned above. Linear re-
gression procedures were used when the outcome variables were
continuous (eg, dietary nutrient intake or serum analyte
concentration). For categorical outcomes, such as whether the

amount meeting the standard of a nutrient intake was re-
ported, logistic regression procedures were used. Most of the
results shown in the article are for the LND foods variables ex-
pressed as number of mentions.
RESULTS
More than 30% of daily energy in the diets of 8- to 18-
year-old US children and adolescents was contributed by
LND foods, with sweeteners and desserts jointly account-
ing for nearly 25% (Table 1). The third tertile of the
number of LND foods mentioned had a higher propor-
tion of non-Hispanic whites, respondents with higher fam-
ily income, and supplement users (Table 2). The 2-day
average number of hours of television watched, the weekly
hours reportedly spent on physical activity, body mass
index, self-perceived body weight status, or history of at-
tempted weight loss in the past year were unrelated to
the reported number of LND foods (Table 2).
Table 3 presents the adjusted mean±SE of energy
and macronutrient intake by tertiles of the reported num-
ber of LND foods. Intakes of total energy and percent-
age of energy from carbohydrate and fat were positively
related, but percentages of energy from protein and di-
etary fiber were related inversely to the number of LND
foods mentioned. Percentage of energy from saturated
fat was not related to the reported number of LND foods.
The total amount of all reported foods and beverages,
amount of LND foods, and percentage of energy from LND
foods related positively, but the amounts of foods and
beverages from the 5 major food groups (grain, fruits,
vegetables, meat and alternates, dairy) were related in-
versely to the reported number of LND foods (P.001).
Table 4 shows the mean amount of selected food
groups and nutrients, and percentage of US children and
adolescents meeting the dietary reference intake for se-
lected nutrients on recall day, by tertiles of the reported
number of LND foods. The mean amounts of foods from
the fruit and dairy groups declined with increasing LND
food tertiles in both boys and girls. The odds of mention-
ing any food from the fruit or the dairy groups on recall
day were also lower in girls in the third tertile of number
of LND foods mentioned. The odds of mentioning a food
from the grain, vegetable, and meat or alternate groups did
not differ among tertiles of number of LND foods (data
are shown for dairy and fruit groups only).
In girls, the reported mean amounts of all micro-
nutrients examined (except vitamin E) declined with ter-
tiles of reported number of LND foods (P.05). In boys,
the reported mean amounts of folate, vitamin B6
, cal-
cium, and magnesium declined with tertiles of reported
number of LND foods. The percentage of children and
adolescents meeting the respective standard of intake of
folate, vitamins B6
and A, and the minerals magnesium,
iron, and zinc on recall day decreased with increasing ter-
tiles of number of LND foods. Children and adolescents
in the highest third of LND food reporting had at least
50% lower odds of meeting the estimated average re-
quirement for folate, vitamin B6
, magnesium, iron, and
zinc on recall day.
The independent association of the reported num-
ber of LND foods with the serum concentrations of se-
lected vitamins and carotenoids was also examined. In
multiple regression models, the number of LND foods
was not an independent predictor of serum concentra-
tion of most of the analytes examined. Serum homocys-
teine concentration was available for 1209 children and
adolescents in the analytic sample. Multicovariate-
adjusted serum homocysteine concentration for the
first, second, and third tertiles of number of LND foods
mentioned was 0.90±0.027, 0.97±0.081, and 1.07±0.041
mg/L (6.7±0.2, 7.2±0.6, and 7.9±0.3 µmol/L), respec-
tively (P for trend=.009). It is noteworthy that dietary
vitamin C and folate were significant positive predictors
of serum concentration of vitamin C and folate, respec-
tively, in both boys and girls. Dietary carotenoid intake
related positively to serum concentration of -carotene
and -carotene, but was unrelated to serum -cryp-
toxanthin and lycopene. (Data on serum analyte con-
centration are not shown and are available from the
author.)
The results presented above were largely the same
when the LND food variable was expressed as amount
reported (in grams) or as percentage of total energy
intake.
COMMENT
American children and adolescents reported nearly a third
of their daily energy intake from relatively energy-
dense, low-nutrient foods, with sweeteners, candy, car-
bonated or noncarbonated beverages, and desserts pro-
viding approximately a quarter of the total daily energy
intake. A third of the 8- to 18-year-old population ex-
amined reported 6 or more LND foods on the recall day,
providing an average of 41% of the total daily energy in-
take. To my knowledge, few other directly comparable
estimates have been published. Differences in methods
used to group foods make comparisons difficult to in-
terpret. In the National Adolescent Health Survey, nearly
60% of those surveyed reported having consumed "junk
food snacks" on the previous day.32 The proportion re-
porting LND food intake was similarly high in the Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance System in 1993.33 Adoles-
cents studied by Bandini and colleagues34 reported ap-
proximately 20% to 27% of their total daily energy in-
take from chips, candy, soda, baked goods, and ice cream.
From the list of food sources of energy in 24-hour re-
calls of 2- to 18-year-olds reported by Subar et al,35 it can
be estimated that approximately 30% of the energy came
from foods comparable to those considered LND in the
present study. Other available estimates of consump-
tion of LND foods are limited to carbonated beverages
or added sugars.11-18
Although the percentage of energy from carbohy-
drate increased with the reported number of LND foods,
grams of fiber decreased, confirming higher consump-
tion of refined carbohydrates and lower consumption of
fruits, vegetables, and grains that provide dietary fiber
and complex carbohydrates. Furthermore, increasing car-
bohydrate intake in association with the reported num-
ber of LND foods was accompanied by a lower percent-
age of energy from protein but not fat. Instead, the
percentage of energy from fat increased slightly with in-

creasing number of LND foods. It is likely that more of
the fat in the diets of those reporting a high intake of LND
foods came from prepared snack foods. Such foods may
contain more of hydrogenated fats that include trans­
fatty acids.36 Trans­fatty acids are also believed to be ath-
erogenic and have been implicated in increased risk of
coronary heart disease.37
It is evident from the data presented in Tables 3 and
4 that there were both qualitative and quantitative differ-
ences in dietary patterns of children who reported high
LND food intake. Foods from the dairy and fruit groups
were less likely to be mentioned and the amount of all nu-
trient-densefoodsreporteddecreasedwithincreasingnum-
ber of LND foods. These data suggest that, on the aver-
age, reporting of LND foods was associated negatively with
reportingofnutrient-densefoods.However,thesearecross-
sectionaldataanddonotallowdefinitiveconclusionsabout
displacement of nutrient-dense foods by LND foods.
Given the food intake data, it is not surprising that
the proportion of children and adolescents, especially girls,
meeting the dietary reference intakes of most examined
micronutrients (except vitamins C and E) on recall day
also declined with increasing tertiles of number of LND
foods reported. The positive association of dietary ascor-
bate, folate, and carotenoids with serum ascorbate, fo-
late, and selected carotenoids, respectively, validates the
reported dietary intakes of these micronutrients. The pub-
lished literature on nutritional implications of LND food
intake is limited to examining the relationship of sugar in-
take (or carbonated beverages) with nutritional quality of
diets, with equivocal results.11-18 Nutritional quality of di-
ets was found to be negatively impacted by carbonated bev-
erage consumption by some,11,12 while others have con-
cludedthathighsugarconsumershadhigherenergyintake
without adverse nutritional consequences.13,15,16
The reported hours spent on exercise or watching
television varied little by the number of LND foods re-
ported. These data do not support the widely held belief
that a high LND food intake is associated with more tele-
vision time or limited physical activity. However, the num-
ber of LND foods mentioned was an independent posi-
tive predictor of energy intake; increased energy intake
in association with LND food intake without a concur-
rent increase in energy expenditure would play a role in
promoting a positive energy balance.38
In this study, the reported number of LND foods did
not relate to sex-age­adjusted body mass index. Ban-
dini et al34 also found that obese adolescents did not re-
port more energy from LND foods relative to nonobese
adolescents. Others have similarly found no association
between reported body mass index and added sugar in-
take.13,17 Conversely, Ludwig et al39 found consumption
of sweetened drinks to be related to obesity in children.
The observed lack of an association between body mass
index and LND food intake may partly be attributable
to dieting by overweight respondents as well as measure-
ment error (discussed in the next paragraph).
All methods of dietary assessment including the 24-
hour dietary recall used in NHANES III are subject to mea-
surement errors.40 Data from a 24-hour recall are believed
to be suitable forestimating usual dietary intakes ofgroups,
but not individuals.24 Prevalence of micronutrient inad-
equacy in particular is likely to be overestimated in 24-
hour recall data because of intraindividual variation in food
intake.41 Therefore, this study makes no claims to estimat-
ing prevalence of marginal nutrient intakes in association
with LND reporting. It is preferable to interpret the re-
sults presented in Table 4 as indicating that 8- to 18-year-
oldAmericansgroupedinthehighestthirdofreportednum-
ber of LND foods consumed reported lower amounts of
nutrient-dense foods and were more likely to report less
than the estimated average requirement of several nutri-

bodymassindexorserumanalyteconcentrations.42 Asmen-
tioned already, a positive association of dietary vitamin in-
take (ascorbate, folate, and carotenoids) with serum con-
centrations of the respective analytes in the present study
increases confidence in the dietary data.
Underreporting of food intake is one of the sources
of measurement error in dietary assessment.40 However,
the nature, extent, or determinants of underreporting in
children and adolescents are poorly understood. In the
present study, a ratio of reported energy intake to esti-
mated basal energy expenditure was calculated as a mea-
sure of reporting status and found to be positively re-
lated to LND food intake (P for trend, .001). Finally,
there may be differential misreporting of LND foods be-
cause of the social desirability bias. However, it is note-
worthy that in adults in the NHANES III, ratio of re-
ported energy intake to energy expenditure for basal needs
related positively to reporting of both nutrient-dense and
LND foods.43 Nevertheless, there is a possibility that es-
timates of reported LND food intake from the present
study may be lower than actual intakes.
The results indicate that LND foods are widely con-
sumed by American children and adolescents, and sug-
gest opportunities for improving nutrient intake profiles
by interventions to moderate LND food intake. In my opin-
ion, the needed interventions to change this behavior must
be from several directions. Consistent with the philoso-
phy of not labeling foods "good" or "bad," the food guide
pyramid groups many LND foods (eg, desserts and salty
snacks) as part of the dairy or grain groups.44 The extent
to which most consumers comprehend and implement the
recommended fat and sugar substitutions necessary to in-
clude foods such as baked or dairy desserts in the diet is
not known. Nevertheless, simplification of dietary guid-
ance messages regarding inclusion of LND food in the diet
may be useful. Second, interventions need to target fami-
lies and children. A recent study45 suggested that family-
basedinterventionsthatfocusedonincreasingfruitandveg-
etable intake were also effective in reducing the intake of
LND foods for parents and children. Practitioners may find
the strategy of emphasizing nutrient-dense foods useful for
moderating the intake of LND foods, with a resultant de-
crease inenergy intakes and improvementof intakeofcriti-
cal micronutrients. However, interventions targeting chil-
dren and adolescents to lower LND food intake may need
a more creative approach; there is preliminary evidence to
suggest that children perceive foods labeled "healthy" as
not being "tasty."46 Because taste is a major determinant
of food consumption,47 nutritionmessages forchildrenand
adolescents have to promote the nutrient-dense foods with
a different marketing angle. Third, as has been suggested
elsewhere, marketing of soft drinks, candies, and pre-
pared baked or fried snacks in school cafeterias and vend-
ing machines should be discouraged and alternate foods
including milk and fruit should be promoted.7,48 Finally,
the food industry should be a partner in these interven-
tions by avoiding aggressive marketing of food products
without nutritionally redeeming qualities.
In conclusion, the results suggest that LND food
mentions by 8- to 18-year-old Americans were accom-
What This Study Adds
There has been no systematic, comprehensive study of
the extent of contribution of LND foods to the diets of
American children and adolescents or the nutritional and
health implications, if any, of consumption of such foods.
Nearly a third of the total daily energy in the diets of 8-
to 18-year-old American children and adolescents was
contributed by LND foods (sweeteners, beverages, des-
serts, discretionary fats, and salty snacks). Increasing men-
tions of LND foods on the recall day were associated with
higher energy intake but lower amounts of nutrient-
dense foods and high-risk micronutrients.
