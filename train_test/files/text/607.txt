The role of residential mobility in reproducing socioeconomic
stratification during the transition to adulthood
Anne Clark1
Abstract
OBJECTIVE
This study assesses whether frequency of residential mobility plays a role in the
reproduction of socioeconomic inequality during the transition to adulthood based on
two criteria: (1) selection ­ is there socioeconomic sorting into residential trajectories?
­ and (2) lack of moderation ­ is this sorting irreducible to other life events that prompt
moves (e.g., changes in employment status)?
METHODS
I use two and a half years of monthly address data from the Relationship Dynamics and
Social Life data set, a sample of 18- and 19-year-old young women in a Michigan
county. As an improvement upon previous measures of residential mobility, I use
group-based trajectory analysis to categorize young women into residential trajectory
groups. I then conduct a series of nested logistic regressions to predict membership in
residential trajectory groups and a decomposition analysis to determine whether rapid
movers are exposed to more life events (e.g., entering/exiting employment) or are
simply more sensitive to moving in the face of life events compared to gradual movers.
RESULTS
Rapid moving is associated with low socioeconomic status. Rapid movers experience
similar family formation, employment, and academic changes as gradual movers but
are more likely to move when faced with these life events.
CONCLUSIONS
High residential mobility is a phenomenon among early home-leavers as part of an
accelerated and underfunded transition to adulthood rather than a reflection of the
upward socioeconomic mobility of college students.
CONTRIBUTION
High residential mobility is not simply a neutral or normative aspect of the transition to
adulthood but rather part of the process of reproducing socioeconomic stratification.

1. Introduction
Most studies of residential mobility during the transition to adulthood in the United
States focus on either home-leaving (and its counterpart, `boomeranging' back to the
family home) or locational attainment. The former line of inquiry emphasizes the
implications of the timing of residential independence for socioeconomic attainment
and an overall healthy and successful progression through life course stages (Aassve,
Cottini, and Vitali 2013; Aquilino 1991; Buck and Scott 1993; Goldscheider and
Goldscheider 1998; Kahn, Goldscheider, and García-Manglano 2013; Lei and South
2016; Leopold 2012; Sandberg-Thoma, Snyder, and Jang 2015; White and Lacy 1997).
The latter, a more recent development, investigates residential mobility outside of the
parental home as an important contributor to the reproduction of socioeconomic
inequality during the transition to adulthood (Sharkey 2012; Swisher, Kuhl, and Chavez
2013). Both literatures tend to emphasize individual moves or transitions (e.g., between
two neighborhoods) and whether those moves are advantageous or disadvantageous to
young adults' long-term socioeconomic attainment.
What remains unclear is the role of frequency of residential mobility in
reproducing socioeconomic inequality. Frequent residential mobility during the
transition to adulthood is often assumed in the life course literature to be a normative
consequence of educational, career, and romantic exploration (Arnett 2000; Jang and
Snyder 2015; Michielin and Mulder 2008; White and Lacy 1997). In contrast, research
on housing instability has found that frequent residential mobility is a phenomenon
among individuals with low socioeconomic status (Astone and McLanahan 1994;
Burgard, Seefeldt, and Zelner 2012) that is associated with negative outcomes in the
realms of education, employment, food security, and health (Boynton-Jarrett, Hair, and
Zuckerman 2013; Desmond 2016; Desmond and Gershenson 2016; Desmond and
Kimbro 2015; Fowler, Henry, and Marcal 2015). These two perspectives yield very
different assumptions about who moves during the transition to adulthood and how
these moves are associated with trajectories of status attainment.
Therefore, the present study asks: Does high residential mobility play a role in the
reproduction of socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood? I assess
this question using two criteria: selection and lack of moderation. Young adults with
low socioeconomic status (SES) must be sorted into trajectories of rapid residential
mobility (selection) and differences across residential trajectories cannot simply be a
symptom of differences in educational, occupational, and romantic careers (lack of
moderation).
I use two and a half years of monthly move data for a random, population-based
sample of 868 18- and 19-year-old women in a Michigan county from the Relationship
Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) Study. RDSL represents an improvement over
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 171
previous longitudinal data sets in capturing residential mobility in that monthly data
collection promotes greater accuracy among my key subpopulation of interest: those
experiencing housing instability. The high level of detail in the residential data allows
me to combine number and timing of moves in the form of residential trajectories.
Trajectories are more nuanced than traditional measures of high residential mobility,
such as a threshold number of moves per time period (e.g., three moves per year or
three moves per three years) (Cutuli et al. 2013; Pavao et al. 2007). Given that the
transition to adulthood is the period of the life course with the highest rates of
residential mobility (Arnett 2000), measures that incorporate more detail are crucial in
order to better distinguish between normative and potentially disadvantageous moving
behaviors. The high level of detail in RDSL, leveraged using trajectory methods, yields
new insight into the relationship between residential mobility and stratification during
the transition to adulthood and provides evidence for considering residential mobility as
an independent form of inequality that is irreducible to other life events.
2. Background
2.1 Selection
The transition to adulthood is a distinct life course stage when frequent residential
mobility is normative (Arnett 2000). Young adults, typically defined as aged 18­25,
experience frequent change as they explore occupations, romantic interests, and
worldviews. Entrances into and exits from schools, jobs, and cohabiting relationships
often are accompanied by moves. As a result, mobility peaks during young adulthood
and declines thereafter: 33% of 18­25-year-olds have moved at least once in the past
year, compared to 17% of 30­44-year-olds and 9% of 45­64-year-olds (author
calculations using data from the 2008­2010 American Community Survey).
Perceptions of how residential mobility varies by SES during the transition to
adulthood differ in the transition to adulthood literature compared to the housing
literature. Some in the transition to adulthood tradition may assume that higher
residential mobility is a function of college attendance (Lei and South 2016), especially
given the expansion of access to postsecondary education over the past 20 years
(National Center for Education Statistics 2015). Moves may therefore be associated
with upwardly mobile or neutral life events ­ such as entering school, summer break,
graduation, and career acquisition ­ among individuals with high SES. However, only
43% of young adults enroll in a postsecondary program (Snyder and Dillow 2015), and
only 52% of those students move out of the parental home to attend college (Bozick
Clark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood
172 http://www.demographic-research.org
2007). This leaves a significant number of moves during young adulthood unaccounted
for.
In contrast, researchers in the housing instability tradition assume that most high
residential mobility is a form of housing instability (Cutuli et al. 2013; Pavao et al.
2007). Housing instability can be conceptualized broadly as a period of financial
distress accompanied by tenuous housing and/or residential mobility. If unchecked,
housing instability can eventually lead to homelessness (Desmond 2016). In this
framework, frequent moving may be a phenomenon among low-SES young adults who
lack the resources to maintain their housing when faced with job loss, relationship
instability, or start-and-stop schooling (Curtis et al. 2013). The ability of young adults
to support an independent household may be dependent on multiple interrelated factors,
including their own financial resources, the availability of family support, and
household size (i.e., having to support additional people in the form of a partner and/or
children) (Desmond and Gershenson 2017; Desmond, Gershenson, and Kiviat 2015).
2.2 Lack of moderation
If rapid movers have low SES, they should experience more life events reflective of
educational, occupational, and romantic instability. Low-SES young adults are less
likely to pursue postsecondary education (Bozick and DeLuca 2011). However, if they
do, they are more likely to delay enrollment (Bozick and DeLuca 2005) and experience
interrupted enrollment (Goldrick-Rab 2006). While college students and college
graduates are exploring potential career paths, their less-advantaged peers experience
"fragmented transitions into work" (Shanahan 2000). High school graduates face either
prolonged periods of unemployment or a `career' consisting of a series of low-paid,
high-turnover jobs (Rosenbaum 2001). Low-income young adults are also more likely
to experience cycles of relationship dissolution and reconciliation (Halpern-Meekin et
al. 2013). Low-SES young women are much more likely to become single or cohabiting
mothers during the transition to adulthood than their high-SES counterparts, who are
more likely to delay family formation to complete their postsecondary education and
establish a career (Amato et al. 2008). It is possible, then, that these stratified
experiences yield more frequent moves for young adults with low SES (Warner and
Sharp 2016), perhaps in ways that reify or exacerbate inequality in other areas of life.
However, differences in residential trajectories may not simply be a symptom of
differences in educational, occupational, and romantic careers. If moves are associated
with life events there are two factors that can explain greater residential mobility in
some groups of movers but not others: differences in exposure and differences in
sensitivity. Either more frequent movers are exposed to more life events, necessitating
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 173
more frequent moving, or they are more sensitive to these events, resulting in a greater
likelihood of moving when they happen, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. For
example, more frequent movers may move from job to job or experience intermittent
school enrollment with periods of working in-between, necessitating more moves.
Alternately, even when faced with the same life event, low-SES individuals are more
likely to experience a move, whether involuntarily (e.g., because they have no financial
buffer to pay rent during unemployment) or voluntarily (e.g., because an increase in
income facilitates a move out of a temporary and undesirable living situation). Most
likely, both greater exposure and greater sensitivity explain differences in moving
behavior. This is consistent with the assumptions of the housing instability literature,
according to which housing instability is the result of both financial shocks (e.g., job
loss, medical emergency) and the absence of resources to weather those shocks (Curtis
et al. 2013).
3. Data and methods
3.1 Relationship Dynamics and Social Life Study
I use data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) Study, a
longitudinal survey based on a random, population-based sample of 1,003 18- and 19-
year-old women in a Michigan county. Respondents were drawn from state driver's
license and ID card records. After a face-to-face baseline interview conducted between
March 2008 and July 2009, respondents completed weekly interviews for two and a
half years via a secure website or phone. Of the women located, 93% participated in the
baseline interview, and more than 72% of women interviewed at baseline remained in
the study for at least 18 months. This analysis uses a sample of 868 respondents who
remained in the study for at least two months, the minimum amount of time necessary
to encounter the residential change question at least twice.
RDSL provides unique insight into the residential trajectories of young women for
multiple reasons. First, monthly measures of mobility for a large, population-
representative sample yield the most accurate picture of residential mobility patterns to
date. Second, although RDSL data is drawn from a tight cohort in only one county, this
ensures that the respondents face the same housing and employment markets,
educational opportunities, and any other time-varying and geographic factors that
influence residential mobility. Third, analyzing young women separately from young
men eliminates the need to disentangle gendered family formation (Meier and Allen
2008; Mollborn 2007), home-leaving (Avery, Goldscheider, and Speare 1992; Buck
and Scott 1993), and rental processes (Desmond 2012) that lead to gendered
Clark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood
174 http://www.demographic-research.org
experiences of housing instability and homelessness (Desmond 2012; US Department
of Housing and Urban Development 2014). And finally, while RDSL does not capture
all of the transition to adulthood, which traditionally comprises ages 18­25, it does
capture the period with the most heterogeneity, mobility, and participation in activity
typical for that stage of the life course (Arnett 2000). The age range of RDSL
respondents enables me to capture in great detail the residential trajectories of those
who leave home early and struggle in establishing stable households.
RDSL samples are from a narrow geographic area. However, this level of detailed
mobility data, reported in monthly intervals, is not available in national data sets.
Although the National Survey of Families and Households ­ which is frequently used
to investigate home-leaving and returns to the parental home (Aquilino 1991;
Goldscheider and Goldscheider 1998; De Marco and Berzin 2008; Tang 1997; White
and Lacy 1997) ­ includes an event history calendar, respondents are asked to recall
multiple years of housing history at a time. This traditional panel structure likely yields
an undercount of moves in my key subpopulation of interest, rapid movers, especially if
they go through periods of couch surfing or other forms of housing instability where
exact dates and number of residences may be difficult to recall years later. Given that
young adulthood is marked by a great deal of change in multiple areas of life, with
significant consequences for future status attainment, more intensive data collection is
necessary to accurately capture residential mobility and its interrelationships with
romantic, employment, and academic changes.
Although RDSL's sample generalizes to a single county in Michigan, the
respondents are roughly comparable to the US population of 18- and 19-year-old
women at the time of data collection, as measured using the 2008­2010 American
Community Survey (ACS) 3-year Estimates (calculations available from the author
upon request). Less than half of both samples are employed, approximately one-third
move over the course of the year, over two-thirds still live with family, and hardly any
are married. Since RDSL respondents had to already be 18 when they were sampled, by
the time they were interviewed 18-year-olds tended to be older within their 18th year of
age (i.e., exact age within 18-year-olds was skewed older). When both the RDSL and
ACS samples are limited to 19-year-olds, RDSL respondents have a uniform exact age
distribution (age in days unavailable in ACS PUMS) and comparable enrollment in
both high school (8% vs. 7% respectively) and postsecondary school (63% vs. 60%) to
ACS respondents.
The main difference between the RDSL sample and young women nationally is
racial and ethnic composition. Twice as many RDSL respondents are black or African
American (34% vs. 17%) and less than half as many are Hispanic (8% vs. 19%). As
such, the following analyses are not representative of the residential trajectories of
young Latinas nationally.

3.2 Measures
3.2.1 Residential mobility
Residential mobility is measured based on addresses provided as contact information,
which respondents were asked to update monthly. Addresses are geocoded. Any change
in geocode is captured in a time-varying binary move variable. This binary variable is
used to construct a variable representing cumulative number of moves outside of the
family home: Respondents start with a value of zero or one (for respondents who had
already moved out of the family home by baseline, 24%), with one added at each
interview reporting a move. Attributing a move at baseline for early home-leavers
reduces the impact of unobserved heterogeneity based on left-censoring of home-
leaving trajectories, although I cannot deduce the number of moves outside of the
family home that occurred before baseline. This cumulative variable assumes that
respondents do not return to the family home. Supplemental analyses after the main
results will address boomeranging, or returns to the family home after the initial home-
leaving move. The cumulative move variable is used to identify groups of respondents
with similar residential trajectories using group-based trajectory analysis, as discussed
further below. This categorical variable is the measure I ultimately use in my analyses
to identify sorting into residential trajectory groups and differences in exposure as
opposed to sensitivity to life events across groups.
The 868 respondents in this analysis experienced a total of 1,038 moves during the
study. Over the course of the study 43% of respondents never moved, 26% moved
once, 15% moved twice, 8% moved three times, and 8% moved four or more times
(with a maximum of eight moves).
Each move is coded for context. Specifically, the moves are coded for relationship,
employment, and academic changes that occurred concurrently with the move.
Relationship changes were measured weekly, residential mobility was measured
monthly, and academic and employment changes were measured quarterly. The data
does not include when the events occurred in relation to each other.
A single move could be associated with multiple events in other life domains (see
Table A-1 in the Appendix for details). Relationship events ­ entering cohabitation,
exiting cohabitation, intimate partner violence, and pregnancy or giving birth ­ are not
mutually exclusive. For example, a woman could both enter cohabitation and become
pregnant. In contrast, employment changes ­ (1) entering a job or changing part-time to
full-time and (2) leaving a job or changing full-time to part-time ­ are mutually
exclusive. Academic events include starting school, summer break, transferring to a
school granting a higher degree (e.g., from a two-year college to a four-year college),
transferring to a school granting a lower degree (e.g., from a four-year college to a two-
year college), graduating school, and quitting school. These events are mutually
Clark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood
176 http://www.demographic-research.org
exclusive. There were 14% of moves that could not be linked with a relationship,
employment, or academic event.
3.2.2 Baseline characteristics
Childhood and baseline transition to adulthood characteristics predict residential
trajectory group membership during the study. These predictors are organized into five
groups: childhood background and race, family support, financial resources, education
and employment, and family formation.
Childhood background and race are captured by four dichotomous variables, coded
to one for each of the following conditions: The respondent identifies as black or
African American, the respondent's mother's educational attainment is less than a high
school diploma or equivalent, the respondent did not grow up with two biological
parents or a biological parent and a step-parent, and the respondent's family ever
received public assistance during the respondent's childhood.
Family support is measured by whether the respondent received financial support
from her family at baseline and by whether the respondent was very or extremely close
to her mother or father during childhood.
The respondent's financial resources at baseline are captured by two measures.
The first is a binary variable indicating whether the respondent had just enough or not
enough money for monthly expenses (as opposed to having some money left over at the
end of the month). The second is a binary variable indicating whether the respondent
was a recipient of some form of public assistance.
The respondent's employment at baseline is represented by a dichotomous variable
indicating whether the respondent was employed at all. The respondent's educational
enrollment at baseline is captured by a categorical variable with three categories: not
enrolled (the reference category), enrolled in high school, and enrolled in postsecondary
school.
The respondent's family formation behavior at baseline is measured by whether
the respondent was married, engaged, or cohabiting and whether she had ever
experienced a live birth.
3.3 Group-based trajectory analysis
Housing instability is often operationalized as a dichotomous variable using a threshold
number of moves over a given time period because most measures of housing
instability are retrospective over many years. Conceptually, however, housing
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 177
instability is better reflected by differences in rate of moves across members of a
population. For example, some individuals with a high number of moves may move so
rapidly that the constant struggle to maintain stable housing is consuming all of their
time and resources, while other individuals with a high number of moves may relocate
at regular intervals consistent with normative institutional constraints, such as academic
years.
Therefore, I construct a categorical measure of residential mobility based on rate
of moving via slopes of trajectories. This measurement strategy is made possible by the
detailed monthly move data available in RDSL. Trajectories allow moves to be nested
within women and contextualized with regards to when they occur in women's lives
and when they occur in relation to each other, consistent with a life course perspective.
Specifically, using age-graded trajectories distinguishes between leaving home and
subsequently moving at different ages, which is crucial given that even a one- or two-
year difference in timing during the transition to adulthood can be substantively
meaningful (e.g., the difference between leaving the parental home after high school or
after completing an associate's degree).
I use group-based trajectory analysis (GBTA) as opposed to an alternative such as
growth curve modeling (GCM) because a method that yields a single population
average trajectory fundamentally fails to distinguish between movers and nonmovers.
Furthermore, housing stable movers and housing unstable movers likely experience
different trajectories. GBTA assumes that latent statistical processes generate distinct
groups with respect to some variable that changes over time or with age (Nagin 2005;
Nagin and Odgers 2010; Wagmiller, Jr. et al. 2006). In other words, rather than
assuming that the population varies normally around some mean population trajectory
(as with GCM), GBTA assumes that a latent variable divides the population into
subpopulations, each with its own mean trajectory. Because the variable dividing the
population into distinct patterns of behavior is unobserved, group membership must be
inferred from the mix of trajectories based on the trajectories' shape. GBTA can
simultaneously estimate the predicted trajectory of each group, the percent of the
sampled population in each group, and a respondent's probability of group membership
(i.e., posterior probabilities). I use these posterior probabilities to sort respondents into
trajectory groups to generate further descriptive statistics, run a series of nested models
predicting group membership, and conduct a decomposition analysis, described below.
The traditional GBTA model assumes that attrition is independent of trajectory
group membership. However, nonrandom attrition may impact estimates of trajectory
group size, particularly when trajectories are initially not well separated and become
more distinct over time, as is the case here. Haviland, Jones, and Nagin (2011)
developed an extension of GBTA for correcting estimates of trajectory group size for
nonrandom attrition, which I incorporated as a sensitivity analysis using the traj
Clark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood
178 http://www.demographic-research.org
command in Stata. I ran the final model testing for constant attrition and attrition as a
function of previous residential mobility. Estimates for group size were stable.
Therefore, I present the final model without adjusting for attrition.
3.4 Decomposition
Decomposition is closely related to standardization (Das Gupta 1993). Both techniques
disentangle differences in subpopulation composition (e.g., age structure) from
differences in subpopulation-specific conditional probabilities (e.g., age-specific death
rates) which combine to yield differences in overall rates (e.g., crude death rate) across
populations. However, while standardization holds composition constant to examine
differences in conditional probabilities, decomposition determines the percent of the
difference in overall rates attributable to differences in composition and the percent
attributable to differences in conditional probabilities.
In this case, differences across mover groups in rates of experiencing move types
are attributable to both compositional differences in experiencing a given life event and
differences in conditional probabilities of moving given the life event. More
substantively, compositional differences can be considered differences in exposure to
life events and differences in conditional probability can be considered differences in
sensitivity to moving in response to life events. For example, if some groups are more
likely to move while entering school, this can be a result of their greater propensity to
enter school, their higher probability of moving when they enter school, or both.
Broadly, the decomposition method used here can be summarized as follows (Preston,
Heuveline, and Guillot 2001):
Difference in rate of move type = difference in exposure to life event (weighted
by average sensitivity to life event) + difference in sensitivity to life event
(weighted by average exposure to life event).
The decomposition will show whether rapid movers move more frequently than
other movers because they are exposed to more life events that prompt moves, because
they are simply more sensitive to moving when faced with a life event, or both. I
bootstrap standard errors to test whether exposure effects and sensitivity effects are
significant (Wang et al. 2000).
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7

4. Results
The final GBTA model contains three linear residential trajectory groups. These groups
comprise a categorical measure of residential mobility used in the following sections to
identify socioeconomic selection into trajectory groups and differences in exposure and
sensitivity to life events across trajectory groups. The Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) improved with the addition of further trajectory groups up to a total of five (the
BIC is ­13,325 for three groups and ­12,825 for five groups). However, beginning with
the four-group model, estimates of group size were highly sensitive to the addition of
covariates when multinomial logits predicting group membership were estimated
simultaneously with the trajectories (e.g., the estimated size of the smallest group in the
four-group model ranged from 5% to 13% of the population). This suggests that
residential trajectories across groups were no longer distinct, such that baseline
characteristics significantly influenced trajectory group membership for individuals
whose residential trajectories resembled the average of two adjacent groups. This left
group membership highly dependent on the selection of covariates. The final model
uses three groups so that residential trajectory groups are empirically distinct.
Figure 1 displays the results of the GBTA model identifying three distinct
residential trajectory groups in this population of young women: rare movers, gradual
movers, and rapid movers. The figure depicts estimated trajectories for each trajectory
group, the 95% pointwise confidence intervals on the estimated trajectories, and the
observed group means for each trajectory. The legend includes the estimated percent of
the population in each group. These population estimates are generated by the GBTA
model. In contrast, Figure 2 presents sample means calculated by assigning each RDSL
respondent to a trajectory group using posterior probabilities generated by the GBTA
model. Figure 2 shows the distribution of moves occurring during the study within each
trajectory group. Note that women who had already left the family home by baseline
(24% of the sample) are categorized as movers due to their early home-leaving, even if
they do not move during the observation period.

The largest residential trajectory group (estimated 42% of the population) is
characterized by no residential change. Women in this trajectory group will henceforth
be called rare movers. All rare movers were living with family at baseline (descriptive
statistics for living with family at baseline available upon request). Most (87% of rare
movers) do not move over the course of the study, and a small fraction (12%) move
once toward the end of the study out of the family home (an additional 1% move twice
toward the end of the study; descriptive statistics for timing of moves available upon
request). The rare movers have a very stable residential trajectory characterized by
residence in the parental home for most if not all of the study period.
The second largest residential trajectory group (35% of the population) is
characterized by gradual residential change. Women in this trajectory group will
henceforth be called gradual movers. Most gradual movers lived in the family home at
baseline (76% of gradual movers) and move once (49%) or twice (24%) over two and a
half years, with moves spaced about one year apart. This level of mobility is consistent
with young women gradually gaining independence and/or coordinating their housing
with the academic calendar.
The final residential trajectory group (24% of the population) is characterized by
rapid residential change. Women in this trajectory group will henceforth be called rapid
movers. Most rapid movers had moved out of the family home by baseline (65% of
rapid movers) and experience moves in rapid succession, with around half (51%)
moving three or more times over the course of the study. This mobility pattern is
potentially unstable, contingent on other characteristics of the respondents and their
moves.
4.1 Selection
Table 1 presents the results of two series of nested logistic regressions of baseline
characteristics that predict membership in residential trajectory groups. The first series
(Models 1­5) predicts whether respondents were movers (i.e., rapid or gradual movers
vs. rare movers). The second series (Models 6-10) limits the sample to movers and
predicts whether respondents were rapid movers (vs. gradual movers). To shed light on
mediated (indirect) effects between low socioeconomic status and patterns of residential
mobility, Models 1 and 6 begin with indicators of childhood background and race,
which I interpret as exogenous. In the following models, I introduce blocks of variables
corresponding to different dimensions of the transition to adulthood: family support,
financial resources, education and employment, and family formation.

(Model 1). The effect of childhood poverty is fully mediated by financial resources
available to the respondent at baseline: Movers are less likely to receive financial
support from family (Model 2) and more likely to have difficulty paying for their
expenses and to receive public assistance (Model 3). The effect of growing up without
two parents is partially but not fully mediated by these indicators of financial resources.
High school enrollment predicts membership in the rare-mover group (Model 4) and
being in a serious relationship (married, engaged, or cohabiting) is associated with
residential mobility (Model 5). However, neither of these variables significantly
mediates the effects of childhood background. Notably, enrollment in postsecondary
school does not significantly predict residential mobility (Model 4).
Among movers, growing up in a household that received public assistance is
associated with rapid moving (Model 6). The effect of childhood poverty is fully
mediated by financial resources: Rapid moving is associated with lack of financial
support from family (Model 7) and public assistance receipt at baseline (Model 8).
Once again, enrollment in postsecondary school does not significantly predict
residential trajectory group membership (Model 9). However, the effect of all SES
indicators is fully mediated through relationship status (Model 10). Being married,
engaged, or cohabiting at baseline increases the odds of being in the rapid group (as
opposed to the gradual group) by 90% (e64=1.90).
Overall, this paints a picture of residential mobility that is much more consistent
with the struggles of low-SES respondents to support themselves, especially if they
have expanded their households, rather than with the neutral or upwardly mobile moves
of four-year college students.
Finally, identifying as black or African American is significantly associated with
less residential mobility in both sets of models, although the effect of race in the full
sample is mediated by relationship status (Model 5). This is consistent with prior
research showing that African Americans tend to leave home later (Lei and South 2016;
De Marco and Berzin 2008; Tang 1997) and are less mobile than their Caucasian
counterparts despite experiencing greater economic pressures to move, such as high
individual- and neighborhood-level unemployment rates (Spilimbergo and Ubeda
2004).
4.2 Lack of moderation

more likely to exit cohabitation. Otherwise, rapid movers and gradual movers have very

similar relationship, employment, and academic experiences. I also conducted
sensitivity analyses (not shown) testing for differences in exposure using number of
events instead of ever experiencing an event. Results were substantively the same, the
only difference being that the difference in exiting cohabitation was only marginally
significant (p < .10).

differences in sensitivity to moving in the face of life events (see Table A-2 in the
Appendix for results in tabular form). For any given life event, the solid, dark gray bar
represents the percent of gradual movers ever experiencing the move type (i.e., moving
in conjunction with the life event); the solid, light gray bar represents the percent of
rapid movers ever experiencing the move type; and the sum of the shaded bars
represents the difference. The dotted bar represents the proportion of the difference due
to rapid movers' greater exposure to the life event. The striped bar represents the
proportion of the difference due to rapid movers' greater sensitivity to the life event.

As the decomposition clearly demonstrates, rapid movers' greater mobility is
mostly a function of their greater sensitivity to moving in conjunction with other life
events. (This pattern also holds for academic changes, although results are not shown
because the overall differences in experiencing move type were only 0%­5% and
therefore decomposition results were not statistically significant.) Only in the one case
where the difference in exposure was significant in Figure 3 ­ exiting cohabitation ­
does the proportion of the difference due to exposure become significant.

4.3 Supplemental analyses
These trajectories may represent either boomeranging (moving in and out of the family
home) or living with family members who are themselves housing unstable (i.e., the
respondent is a member of a housing unstable household rather than the head of her
own housing unstable household). RDSL did not measure household structure at every
weekly interview, but rather at two points: baseline and an optional supplement one
year into the study. I constructed a summary variable counting the number of moves to
a known family residence. Some 15% of gradual movers and one-fifth (21%) of rapid
movers moved once to a family residence. Twelve respondents in the entire sample
moved twice to a family residence, eight of whom experienced four or move moves.
Therefore, the vast majority of high mobility is not a function of young adults
boomeranging back to stable family residences. While some respondents may be
members of households that are housing unstable, this also cannot account for most
residential mobility.
5. Discussion
This study sought to determine whether residential mobility plays a role in the
reproduction of socioeconomic inequality during the transition to adulthood based on
the presence of socioeconomically stratified selection and absence of moderation by
differential experiences of life events. Using two and a half years of monthly mobility
data for a population-representative sample of young women in a county in Michigan, I
found that movers are young women who experienced poverty as children and have
access to limited financial resources as young adults. Rapid movers have even lower
SES than gradual movers, but the effect of SES for rapid movers is entirely mediated by
relationship status. In other words, rapid movers are having accelerated transitions to
adulthood that they cannot financially support. Second, I found that rapid movers and
gradual movers mostly experience the same educational, employment, and romantic
changes. Rapid movers do not move more frequently because they experience more life
events that prompt moves. Rather, rapid movers are more sensitive to moving in the
face of life changes.
These findings speak to an underlying assumption in the home-leaving literature
that early home-leaving is disadvantageous ­ unless the destination is a college
dormitory ­ because young adults leave home before they are prepared to support
independent households. Previous research has found that early home-leaving is
predicted by poverty, not growing up with two biological parents, and early family
formation (Aquilino 1991; De Marco and Berzin 2008; Sandberg-Thoma, Snyder, and
Demographic Research: Volume 38, Article 7
http://www.demographic-research.org 187
Jang 2015; Tang 1997). However, very little research is available on the actual
aftermath or consequences of early home-leaving (for an exception, see White and Lacy
1997). The results of this study are consistent with previous findings in the home-
leaving literature and begin to confirm the disadvantages associated with early home-
leaving. For rapid movers, who overwhelmingly leave the family home before age 18
or 19, early home-leaving is part of an accelerated and underfunded transition to
adulthood. Rapid movers then experience greater residential mobility, which is not
compensated for by accompanying upwardly mobile life events.
These results are much more consistent with a housing instability perspective on
high residential mobility than a socioeconomically upwardly mobile college student
trajectory. Low-SES individuals do not rely on their parents for housing and often have
already entered serious relationships. With greater financial responsibilities and fewer
resources, they are less able to weather shocks (i.e., maintain stable housing when faced
with relationship and employment changes), although for the most part they are no
more likely to experience these life events.
The RDSL data set provides unprecedented detail on the residential trajectories of
young women. However, I acknowledge some limitations. Significant findings in the
decomposition analysis with regards to relationship and pregnancy changes but not
academic changes could be a result of greater precision in that data. Weekly
relationship and pregnancy changes are linked to monthly moves, as opposed to
quarterly academic changes. However, this is unlikely for two reasons. First, most
academic changes occur at regular, infrequent intervals (i.e., at the beginning or end of
academic terms). Therefore, weekly detail is unnecessary. Furthermore, unlike exiting
or entering cohabitation, the change in academic status does not necessarily occur
simultaneously with the move. Moving may be anticipatory (e.g., before the school year
begins) or reactionary (e.g., after graduation). Second, employment changes are
measured just as infrequently but yielded significant results, suggesting that the
precision of the education data did not interfere with the significance of findings.
Although the data collection site was chosen to be representative of young women
in the United States in many ways, there are very few Latinas in the sample. Available
statistics suggest that Latin Americans may be less likely to be homeless and more
likely to be housing unstable (Conroy and Heer 2003), suggesting that they have
different housing options and constraints compared to non-Hispanics. The findings
from this analysis cannot be generalized to Latinas.
As demographers begin to uncover the ways in which housing can function as a
mechanism for the reproduction of poverty in adulthood (Desmond 2012; Desmond and
Shollenberger 2015), researchers should further explore the role of residential
trajectories in contributing to stratified transition to adulthood experiences. More data
collection is needed at the national level to uncover trends in residential mobility
Clark: Residential mobility and socioeconomic stratification during the transition to adulthood
188 http://www.demographic-research.org
among Latinas and young men. Young men likely experience different residential
mobility patterns than young women due to gendered family formation (Meier and
Allen 2008; Mollborn 2007), home-leaving (Avery, Goldscheider, and Speare 1992;
Buck and Scott 1993), and rental processes (Desmond 2012) that lead to gendered
experiences of housing instability and homelessness (Desmond 2012; US Department
of Housing and Urban Development 2014).
Future research should also capture the entire transition to adulthood. Data
collection for RDSL ended when respondents were 22. This right-censoring is most
significant for the rare-mover group, most of whom remained in the family home at
their last observation. Likely, many members of this group exit the family home by age
25, with some young women experiencing high residential mobility. It is unclear
whether housing instability is substantively different for individuals who are able to
delay home-leaving ­ for example, because they have different relationships with their
families ­ or if these individuals resemble the rapid group but simply exit home later.
Researchers should also disentangle the causal relationship between residential
mobility and associated life events. For rapid movers, housing instability may represent
either a mechanism that can partially account for well-documented educational and
occupational struggles or a significant and previously unmeasured outcome of this
`churning' and `floundering' for low-SES young adults. Data sets with self-reported
reasons for move or voluntariness of move would be particularly well suited to this
analysis. Such research would help determine whether direct housing interventions or
improvements in educational and employment access and security would better address
the cycle of instability experienced by young adults.
