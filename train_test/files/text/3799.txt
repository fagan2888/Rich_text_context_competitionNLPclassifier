Abstract
Design as a creative way of framing and solving problems is considered an essential
business capability in an innovation era. Organizations with design capability can
improve the lives of their customers, stakeholders and employees by creating valuable
products, services and experiences. Design-led innovation is a framework that assists
organizations to develop design capability for creating a better future as well as prof-
itability. However, implementing design-led innovation requires support. This article
presents insights from an action research extended to design innovation catalyst.
The catalyst's aim was to facilitate implementation of design-led innovation in an
Australian Airport Corporation to develop design capability. To date, this extended
role of action researcher as design innovation catalyst has received limited attention.
Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present insights from the experience of the
action researcher as a design innovation catalyst. This paper contributes conceptual and
practical insight into the research design, action research cycles and critical reflection of
an action researcher operating as design innovation catalyst.

Introduction
Design offers a way of framing and solving problems to create a better future
(Simon, 1969) and is considered an essential business capability in an age where
innovation is necessary (Muratovski, 2015). The Design Value Index 2016 confirms
that organizations that use design to innovate outperform rivals (Rae, 2016).
Ultimately, as Buchanan (2015) states, the outcome of design capability within
organizations is to improve the lives of customers, stakeholders and employees
who daily interface with a particular organization. Buchanan's perspective consid-
ers the journey toward design integration not just a matter of profitability, but of
creating a better future for generations to come. However, the challenge remains
(and is particulary relevant for organizations that wish to adopt design), how is
design capability developed.
The research landscape lacks contributions that reveal how design becomes
integrated within the fabric of an organization as a new way creating and capturing
value. Such a gap in knowledge determines that a researcher in this space must
move beyond the traditional boundaries of organizational research toward flexible
and context orientated inquiries. Within the design research society there is recog-
nised need to promote diverse and impactful new modes of research that integrate
deeply into the design process (Dorst & Hendriks, 2007). However, context bound
and flexible approaches to organizational research such as action research have
faced critique from positivist sections of the design society ­ even while conceptual
affinity between the two fields is acknowledged (Silverman, 2015; Swann, 2002).
The purpose of this paper is to explore the extended role of action researcher as
design innovation catalyst. To date this extended role has been utilized in numer-
ous studies seeking to build design capability in organizations, and in such contexts
as aged care (Nusem, Wrigley, & Matthews, 2017), manufacturing (Doherty,
Wrigley, Matthews, & Bucolo, 2015; Krabye, Wrigley, Matthews, & Bucolo,
2013), mining (Townson, Matthews, & Wrigley, 2016), collaborative consumption
(Garrett, Straker, & Wrigley, 2017), and the automotive industry (Bryant &
Wrigley, 2014). These studies involved partnerships between action researchers
as design innovation catalysts and Australian small to medium enterprises that
were facing respective innovation challenges. The outcomes of the studies above
emphasized reporting on the journey of the organizations involved to strengthen
the conceptual legitimacy of design-led innovation (DLI) ­ or a third-person inqui-
ry. To date there has been limited evaluation or reflection upon this extended role
of action researcher as design innovation catalyst to benefit the research commu-
nity ­ second person inquiry (Torbert, 2001). It is to this research gap that this
article responds by providing new knowledge from a second-person inquiry of

action researcher as `catalyst'. The first author undertook a period of 18 months
embedded within an Australian Airport Corporation (AAC), working in partner-
ship with stakeholders to develop design capability.
Background
It is important from the outset of this article to establish four key concepts that are
in a state of interplay throughout this article. First, DLI is a framework with
particular focus on developing design capability. In this context, design is
viewed explicitly in a practical sense as a way of thinking and doing, underpinned
by abductive reasoning that can be learnt and therefore applied to solve problems
(Dorst, 2011). Second, the design innovation catalyst (at times shortened to
`catalyst' throughout the article) is an expert of DLI who demonstrates, engages
and coaches an organization in their journey toward design capability. Third,
action research provides an action-orientated inquiry (Bradbury, 2015) that is
harnessed to deepen intellectual efforts to understand and improve knowledge of
DLI as an emerging field, while simultaneously developing design capability within
the partnering organization. These three concepts interplay and form the basis for
this inquiry, but remain conceptually distinct. The fourth concept is the role of the
action researcher as an active shaper of collaboration (Huzzard, Maina Ahlberg, &
Ekman, 2010). The role of the action researcher is extended by that of the design
innovation catalyst. Enriching the current practice of action research will be the
focus of this article.
Design-led innovation
In an increasingly competitive and uncertain world, the ability of an organization
to innovate becomes a means not only for growth, but also survival. DLI as a
framework is intended to support the learning and consequent application of
design across an organization. Implementation of DLI has been observed to pos-
itively influence firm innovation performance by aiding the realization of new
possibilities (Wrigley, 2016). The DLI framework is illustrated in Figure 1 and is
comprised of the `external' and `internal' spaces of organization, intersected by
`operational' and `strategic' activities. According to Bucolo, Wrigley, and
Matthews (2012), moving through the framework involves three key phases.
These phases are:
1. Gathering customer insights from customers and stakeholder that reveal deeper
latent needs;
2. Proposing future orientated solutions that capture value from these customer
and stakeholder insights, prototyping and testing solutions with stakehold-
ers and;
3. Shaping strategy that leverages the value unlocked by future orientated propo-
sitions ­ these propositions being grounded in customer and stakeholder insight.

Organizational context for action research
Airports operate and grow upon the strength of reputation. The reputation of
being a fast airport with excellent passenger experience attracts customers to do
business at that location. Innovation becomes a necessary activity to take leader-
ship and continually improve operations to maintain good reputation in an indus-
try that is concerned by rankings and awards. Profitability matters aside, airports
play a crucial role as the enabler of mobility on which modern society has become
highly reliant. There is much to be learnt from organizations which operate under
the associated pressures of high reliability status such as airports (Chivers, 2014).
The AAC engaged the design innovation catalyst to implement DLI as a new
approach to creating and capturing value. At the time, the design innovation cat-
alyst was beginning doctoral research in the field of DLI and entered the AAC. The
action-orientated inquiry allowed the design innovation catalyst to work within the
AAC for a period of 18 months. Three cycles of action research occurred, with
each cycle corresponding to an industry project (see Figure 2). Semi-structured
interviews and focus group discussion provided the catalyst greater visibility within
the organization and opportunities to involve a greater number of participants
with DLI, a strategy described by Agostinone-Wilson (2012). Further, data gen-
erated as an outcome of action were captured in field notes and a reflective journal
kept by the catalyst to capture, monitor and assess the participants' growing sense
of awareness (Brodsky, 2008). Additional details of each project can be viewed in
Appendix 1.
Figure 1. Design-led innovation framework.

Each cycle of action research corresponded to the tasks set out by Wrigley
(2016) as crucial to the role of the design innovation catalyst. Wrigley (2016)
states the catalyst must; `dissect' (understand the organization); coach DLI
enabling employees to `learn' design, and; `integrate' DLI before concluding the
embedded period within the organization. Therefore, action research cycle one
sought to `dissect' the AAC context; action research cycle two sought to coach
and `learn' DLI with AAC employees, and; action research cycle three sought to
`integrate' DLI as an accepted way of working across the AAC.
Design innovation catalyst
To facilitate the journey of organization to adopting DLI, the design innovation
catalyst described by Wrigley (2016), becomes vital to guiding an organizations'
progression toward design. The design innovation catalyst coaches the use of
design methods and skills. Further, the catalyst works with an organization's
employees and stakeholders to complete real projects. The catalyst operates
between business and design to translate abstractions of research and the realities
of practice into value for the organization. The framework for the design innova-
tion catalyst (Wrigley, 2016), mirrors that of DLI in that there is an underpinning
axis for related contexts intersected by activities (see Figure 3). The catalyst must
traverse academic and industry domains while undertaking teaching and learning
activities. Such a role requires a pragmatic attitude and a set of capabilities that
promote adaptability. Wrigley (2016; 2017) further describes the capabilities and
practice required to fulfil this role which can be viewed in Table 1.
Figure 2. Extended role of action researcher as Design innovation catalyst framework.
Price et al. 5
An intersection with the capabilities of an action researcher and the design
innovation catalyst can be determined as both roles concern understanding and
improving situations encountered (Bradbury, 2015). However, there are also
unique nuances between the two roles. The defining characteristics of an action
researcher can be conceptually extended by that of the design innovation catalyst.
This extension can be viewed in Table 2.
Action research cycle (ARC) 1 ­ understanding the AAC and building trust
ARC1 challenged the design innovation catalyst to understand and describe
the AAC from within, to develop rapport with stakeholders and employees, dem-
onstrate DLI and convince the organization of the framework's value. Getting to
know the employees within the corporation was the first step. As noted in
the catalyst's written reflections, `The first cycle consisted of learning about the
organization'. The key task for me was to `understand and make sense of the
value chain, pick up aviation lexicon and place myself in contact with various
stakeholders across the business' (Reflective Journal). While interview and focus-
group discussion belong to ethnographic domains of research inquiry, the catalyst
chose to apply these research methods as a formal way of meeting employees
within the corporation. Interviews were conducted across senior management,
middle management and operational levels from all of the nine departments.
Figure 3. Design innovation catalyst framework.
6 Action Research 0(0)
These interviews also increased the visibility of the catalyst and the mandate to
implement DLI across the organization.
This first round of interviews occurred in addition to day-to-day activities such
as attending meetings, lunches and informal staff activities. The catalyst even
joined the AAC football team in order to meet a diverse range of employees.
This unconventional channel outside workplace activities provided opportunities
for the catalyst to meet with senior management and advocate the possibilities of
DLI for the organization. Similarly, the focus group discussion brought together
members of the business development team in which the catalyst was based to
discuss innovation and current perceptions of design. A mix of formal research
methods and informal engagements with employees proved crucial in building a
solid foundation for later learning and integration of DLI within the organization.
One of the challenges for the researcher in the cycle 1 was to gain a deeper
understanding of the organization ­ the culture, processes and vision of the AAC
while retaining a design mindset. This was one of the notable tensions of the role of
action research as catalyst. Having a concise elevator pitch was necessary to ensure
all contact with employees and stakeholders added to the aim of developing design
capability. Many approaches were tried including such as, `I am helping your
organization innovate by engaging with customers not just spreadsheets', to
`I am here to help your organization realise its vision to be world best by

implementing design as a new way of innovating'. In addition, the design catalyst
had to withstand critique from employees who questioned the qualitative and
participatory nature of DLI. For a data-driven organization like an airport oper-
ating in a high-reliability setting, the notion of asking passengers how they liked to
travel was deemed by some as an uncertain practice. The catalyst had to be resilient
to overcome such critique especially given their short history with the organization.
Two critical factors emerged here. First the catalyst was advocating a design-led
approach to innovation which differed to the predominant data-driven approach
of the AAC. Second, the catalyst was not a full-time staff member of the AAC,
instead a `researcher from a university'. Building trust for the catalyst and DLI as a
framework was therefore identified as a priority during ARC1.
During ARC1, one of the key observations by the catalyst was that discussing
the benefits of a design-led approach to innovation was not sufficient to create
interest in DLI. A demonstration of DLI within a project was required. This
insight is consistent with experiential learning theory identified by Beckman and
Barry (2007) as part of the foundations of design thinking. Project 1 was created in
an opportunistic manner with an interested AAC employee who was eager to know
more about DLI. The project involved limited financial risk for the company, a
short timeline and involved a trusted business partner of the AAC. The project
sought to understand under what conditions, passengers did and did not engage
with money exchange services within the airport terminal, in order to shape new
services that would increase the performance of the AAC business partner. Instead
of using sales data to suggest new services, the catalyst demonstrated to interested
stakeholders how design methods could be used to involve customers as co-
creators of new monetary exchange services. One AAC stakeholder who worked
closely alongside the catalyst describes some of the challenges of undertaking DLI:
The most challenging element [about this project] was gaining the `trust' from col-
leagues and [the retail partner] that this [design-led] process would actually work.
Most people are numbers driven and have not done this type of research before.
As a result it was a bit of a challenge to help people fully understand why we

would do this project this particular way, and why we didn't need a massive number
of responses from passengers. (Participant)
The project proved successful for the business partner, with the solution adopted
across the eastern sea board of Australian Airports. With this success, necessary
trust amongst AAC employees for both the catalyst and DLI as a new way of
working was sparked. This trust now needed to be leveraged to create change in
the following cycles of action research. The key learning from ARC1 was, `show
not tell' how DLI works and the benefits that come from this alternative approach
to innovation. Further details and insights from this project are described in Price,
Wrigley and Dreiling (2015). The notion of `show not tell' is consistent with expe-
riential learning theory that can be traced back through the work of Beckman and
Barry (2007) who cite Kolb (1988) and Dewey (1910).
Action research cycle (ARC) 2 ­ teaching and learning DLI
ARC 2 sought to build upon the trust gained in cycle one. In the catalyst's own
words, `Action Research cycle 2 consisted of the "core" of DLI project work.
Building upon the successful platform of AR1, AR2 sought to promote the full
possibility of DLI' (Reflective Journal). The platform to coach a broader range of
employees on how to apply DLI occurred during Project 2 (see Appendix 1).
Project 2 was assigned to the catalyst and involved a diverse range of AAC depart-
ments and an external software consultant. This project had a budget, a strict
timeline and therefore required financial evaluation and approval from the
AAC. The catalyst's role within Project 2 was to coach employees DLI ­ to
gather deep customer insights using design methods, facilitate the development
of future-orientated propositions by reframing (a design activity) and then to eval-
uate current AAC strategy. This coaching occurred through work in small teams
with two to three AAC employees and the catalyst. The tools, methods and
approaches of DLI were experienced together in workshops and at the airport
terminal with passengers. Employees and stakeholders were also encouraged by
the catalyst to use design methods in other projects.
During Project 2, it became clear that the AAC had not yet considered a unified
digital business strategy and various departments were conducting digital value
creation in silos. The absence of a digital business strategy and the information
that various departments were conducting separate digital value creation was
reframed as the second opportunity to demonstrate the value and possibilities of
DLI with employees. However, instead of just demonstrating DLI, the catalyst
emphasised participation, coaching employees on how to gather insights them-
selves, reframe propositions and shape a digital strategy during their own practice.
This coaching occurred closely with three key senior corporation leaders; the
Manager of Research and Innovation; the Manager of Business Development,
and; the Senior Manager of Strategic Planning and Development. The Senior
Manager in particular was a gatekeeper to gaining top level support for DLI as
10 Action Research 0(0)
an appropriate way of innovation within the corporation. If the Senior Manager
believed in DLI and was able to articulate the framework and its potential orga-
nizational contribution to colleagues, then the catalyst felt as if critical progress
was being made. Fortunately the Senior Manager was eager to shape future serv-
ices and products around the AAC's customers' needs and desires, but was without
a framework or the resources to do so.
The catalyst seized this opportunity to demonstrate how DLI could support the
organization's ambitions to become passenger-centric. Top down support was later
achieved, with a mandate from the CEO and Senior Management Team to launch
Project 2 to market. The solution involved a world first service that would create
value for the AAC and its customers. The breakthrough nature of Project 2 also
aligned with the AAC's vision to be innovative ­ creating valuable evidence that
DLI could help move the corporation toward a position of leadership within the
international aviation industry. Further, the act of co-creating a digital strategy
benefited the organization as described within the design innovation catalyst's
reflection, `As part of the production of this strategy, the term `digital' was defined.
This activity required confidence to define what such a term would mean to
[the Airport's] own vision and future operation' and, `this is a healthy activity
for the organization and developed discourse regarding new concepts, technologies
and social trends' (Reflective Journal). The catalyst felt at this moment that the
planning and execution of interviews and focus group discussions would have
slowed the momentum of Project 2. Instead, daily events were documented
through field notes, for example, `[Business development] stakeholders are reading
more widely about innovation, purchasing innovation books and sharing interest-
ing online articles via email with each other. This did not occur during ARC1'
(Field Notes, 21/11/2013). Later these notes were expanded upon as part of
the protocol of participatory observation. The catalyst also engaged in reflective
journal writing to support a growing internal awareness of the events that were
unfolding in the AAC, for example the catalyst reflects:
[In ARC2] there was a clear increase in the use of `innovation', `passenger experience'
and, `customer needs and wants' within the general language of the business devel-
opment team. I took this as a sign that my project-orientated approach to coaching
DLI was having a positive impact. (Reflective Journal)
Increased emphasis on the reflective journal and field notes matched the action-
orientated and pressure filled nature of ARC2. The key learning from this
cycle was that DLI as a framework could assist the corporation to define and
solve the right innovation challenges, rather than mimic or follow the actions of
other industry leading airports ­ contributing new knowledge to the steps required
to move from an innovation-adopting toward an innovation-generating organiza-
tion (Damanpour & Wischnevsky, 2006). Further new knowledge of the transfor-
mation required to shift from innovation adoption to generation was formed
(also see Price & Wrigley, 2016). DLI offered the AAC a level of autonomy and
Price et al. 11
greater confidence in a highly competitive industry. Initiative and leadership was a
positive step for an organization self-described by employees as `smart follower'.
With this success of this evidence-based practice came acceptance of the catalyst as
a trusted member of the AAC.
Action research cycle (ARC) 3 ­ integrating DLI
ARC 3 began after 12 months of inquiry within the AAC by the catalyst and built
upon learning and success of previous projects. Project 3 sought to design a pas-
senger transfer system between the domestic and international terminals of the
AAC. Cycle three differed from the two previous cycles in this period, as the
catalyst was not a project leader. Instead, the catalyst was brought into Project
3 to observe events and the actions of the Manager of Business Development and
Senior Manager of Strategic Planning and Development who were both partici-
pants in Project 2. In particular, the catalyst was seeking to observe how these two
managers applied DLI in their own practice. The Manager of Business
Development played an important role in questioning technology and efficiency
driven approaches to Project 3 by operationally orientated stakeholders, `Any
technology or potential service was met with an evaluation built on the following
small but powerful questioning, "Does the customer need or want this, will this
improve our the customer's experience?"' (Reflective Journal). It became clear that
the two senior managers were able to articulate what DLI was and openly advo-
cate this framework to colleagues, but considered themselves to be project man-
agers rather than implementers of DLI. Following this realisation, the catalyst and
senior managers amended the brief for the Manager of Research and Innovation to
include activities related to DLI, such as gathering customer insights and reframing
propositions. This structural change coincided with the position's vacancy follow-
ing the recruitment of the previous Manager of Research and Innovation to a gulf
airport ­ and prior to the appointment of an incoming Manager. This recruitment
was viewed by the catalyst as evidence of external acknowledgement of the AAC
improved innovation performance following the success of Project 2.
The next priority during ARC3 was to create a set of tools and co-creation
workshop formats that could be repeated in future projects to ensure that DLI
remained an evidence based practice, not just a mindset, a vulnerability described
by Dong (2015). The catalyst applied design tools and methods to the airport
context. These methods and tools during Project 1 and 2 included design narra-
tives; touch point timeline tools; persona design tools; customer interview
approaches and workshop formats. Following the appointment of the incoming
Manager of Research and Innovation, the catalyst coached this new employee
intensely for a period of one month on DLI and the tools and methods and
their application. This coaching process included numerous rounds of gathering
customer insights and reframing exercises.
After 18 months engagement with AAC, the design innovation catalyst had
become a familiar face within the corporation, with regular invitations to industry
12 Action Research 0(0)
events and opportunities to act as a representative for the organization.
This acceptance also presented challenges as the catalyst was becoming part of
the corporate culture. Semi structured interviews and a focus group discussion
were repeated across the organization during the final months within the AAC
in order to gain insight on AAC employees' perceptions of DLI. The foci of these
methods regarded how DLI had been adopted by employees and a reflection of the
events of the last 18 months within the AAC. In addition to these methods, field
notes and reflective journal entries were continued to maintain a day-to-day
account. This mix of ethnographic and participatory observation methods allowed
the catalyst to build a richer perspective to the story of change witnessed within the
AAC. Ethnographic methods allowed a form of feedback between catalyst and
AAC employees as to what extent design capability was being developed. The
findings were that knowledge and skills of DLI had been developed in a small
number of employees through engagement with the catalyst ­ but not across the
entire organization, something that Bucolo (2016) proposes can take many years to
occur. As the catalyst notes, `DLI is being used to negotiate complex problems
concerning multiple airport stakeholders while maintaining core passenger and
customer-centric values' (Field Notes, 13/02/2015). While this change may only
manifest in the actions and language of a select few employees ­ the impact of that
change can spark new fortunes for an entire organization. This type of design
leadership is described by Bucolo et al. (2012) as an important organizational
gap to fill. The Senior Manager of Strategic Planning and Development earlier
identified as a gatekeeper to the broader acceptance of DLI due to their position of
seniority, demonstrated the following understanding of DLI:
I think design-led innovation really starts with the customer -- deep customer insights
-- really understanding the customer, the user, before you jump into an innovation or
a solution. So to really understand what the deeper needs - that goes one step further
than asking through market research what the poor areas are and what needs
improvement. This goes one step beyond. So asking what is behind - important --
why do people behave as they do, or what would they like to experience or see.

The AAC is now considered one of the more innovative airports in the industry,
actively applying new technologies such as leading biometrics trials in a way that
addresses the needs and desires of its own customers. This reputation and recog-
nition is acknowledged through various international industry awards such as
Skytrax 2016 Best Australia Pacific Airport and Australasia's Leading Airport in
World Travel Awards 2016. Importantly, the organization is now focused on
improving the lives of its customers as the inspiration for innovation rather than
investing in efficiency measures alone. One Manager of Research and Innovation,
notes of their role to continue the work of the catalyst in developing design
capability, `One of our KPIs is pushing this knowledge [of DLI] across the orga-
nization. It's a constant customer-centric approach of understanding, improving
Price et al. 13
and improving the improvement' (Participant). After 18 months, the catalyst and
AAC parted formally but however still remain in informal contact, driven by the
strength of personal friendships developed over the course of the embedded period
of research.
Critical reflection ­ extending action researcher as `catalyst'
Criteria set by Bradbury (2010) provides a valuable reference point for critical
reflection on the quality of this inquiry. The criteria; significance, reflexivity, action-
ability and methods and processes are applied to evaluate the quality of this study.
There is also value in deepening the conceptual position of `catalyst' as an exten-
sion of action research by briefly touring the chemical phenomena associated with
the term. As Bradbury notes, the quality of action research can be determined by
the extent to which the action researcher places themselves in a reflexive role as
an agent of change (2010). An agent of change (which incidentally is the precise
chemical definition of catalyst), is placed into an environment where two pre-
existing elements are reacting ineffectively. The first pre-existing element encoun-
tered in this study was the organizational culture and processes within the AAC.
These elements geared the AAC toward mitigating risk and smartly following
industry leaders. The second pre-existing element was a recent mandate by
senior management to take leadership by innovating successfully. Within the
AAC new approaches to innovation were required to take leadership, hence a
turn to design.
In a chemical reaction, the catalyst is introduced as an additional energy source
that accelerates a reaction to the point of creating value. While the design inno-
vation catalyst brought a fresh perspective unconstrained by existing organization-
al processes or culture, it was gaining trust from the AAC to implement DLI that
provided a platform to accelerate the development of design capability. Gaining
trust in this extended role of action researcher as catalyst was a somewhat delicate
task. First the catalyst had to be accepted into the organization ­ to be recognised
and `fit in' to an existing cultural and procedural status quo. To enter a company
and simply disrupt all structures (social and procedural) would place the catalyst as
an outsider and be counterproductive to greater ambitions of the developing
design capability. For this reason this learning in particular is significant and
must be factored into future research applying a similar methodology.
The catalyst must also make explicit their intention to challenge prevailing
standards - to implement DLI as a new source of innovation that is customer-
centred, rather than the prevailing linear and efficiency driven approaches. In this
sense the catalyst must be sensitive to identify the existing status quo, while visible
and resilient enough to be a change agent who implements methods and tools of
design that are actionable even after the catalyst has departed the AAC. In this
back and forth between sensitivity and resilience, enormous energy is exerted to
continuously sense the organization's perception and use of design, then identify
what following actions should be undertaken to further develop design capability.

The learning of `show not tell' as an outcome of Project 1 within the AAC in
particular provides actionable insight. A shared practice of DLI with catalyst and
organizational stakeholders must be the primary mechanism for developing design
capability. Discussion about design only achieves interest, experiencing the possi-
bilities of design is where true learning takes place. Projects that are design-led and
undertaken by both catalyst and organization can be the meeting point in which
experiencing design takes place. While the specific methods applied within each
project will be determined by the context, a procedural perspective of how to
develop design capability is contributed ­ namely, `show not tell' and experience
the possibilities of design together as the primary mechanism for developing
design capability.
These insights are integrated into an enriched design innovation catalyst frame-
work. Figure 4 builds upon the work of Wrigley (2016) to extend the role of the
action researcher by contextualizing where and how actions occur during the
course of research seeking to develop design capability. The key actions of build
trust, drive change, scale knowledge and consolidate new knowledge take place in
associated parts of the framework. These parts of the framework represent various
contexts in which the action research extended to catalyst must negotiate. Key
actions provide greater clarity to the role of the action research when developing
design capability through an extended position as design innovation catalyst.

These key actions also assist in shaping a designerly approach to action research
proposed by Silverman (2015).
Conclusion
Design is now considered an essential business capability that assists organizations
to adapt to changes in technology, society and the marketplace. Consideration of
how design capability is developed in organizations is therefore a relevant area of
inquiry. The notion of `how to' develop design capability demands an action ori-
entated inquiry, with emphasis on creating practical knowledge that is accessible
and repeatable. A design innovation catalyst is an expert in the implementation of
DLI as one approach to developing design capability who extends upon the foun-
dations of action research. The catalyst develops design capability with staff within
an organization, rather than act as an outside observer. However, the specific
actions and learning objectives of an action researcher extended as a `catalyst'
have been implicit to date, with greater emphasis placed on the outcome of organ-
izations who develop design capability. This article has contributed a set of key
tasks and learning objectives for the design innovation catalyst to achieve when
developing design capability within an organization ­ namely `show not tell' to
build trust and interest, and experience the possibilities of design together as the
primary mechanism for developing design capability.

The AAC is in the process of
constructing a radically
new transfer process,
which synthesises the
needs and desires of pas-
sengers with the opera-
tional limits of baggage
handling and security
measures to offer a fast,
efficient and safe transfer
process. The solution,
once completed, is
expected to halve transfer
time when fully operation-
al. The service will be
offered freely to all pas-
sengers, regardless of the
airline they are traveling
with -- a significant
enhancement of the
passenger experience that
was made possible through
enabling business
