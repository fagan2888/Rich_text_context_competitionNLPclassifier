Abstract
Objective: Similar to perfusion studies after acute ischemic stroke, measuring cerebral blood
volume (CBV) via C-arm computed tomography before and after therapeutic interventions may
help gauge subsequent revascularization. We tested serial dilutions of intra-arterial injectable
contrast medium (CM) to determine the optimal CM concentration for quantifying parenchymal
blood volume by flat-panel detector imaging (FD-PBV).
Methods: CM was diluted via saline power injector, instituting time delays for FD-PBV studies.
A red/green/blue (RGB) color scale was employed to quantify/compare FD-PBV and magnetic
resonance-derived CBV (MRCBV).
Results: Contrast values of right and left common carotid arteries did not differ significantly at
CM dilutions of !20%. RGB analysis of FD-PBV imaging (relative to MR-CVB), showed CM dilution
altered the colors (by 16%), increasing red and decreasing blue ratios.
Conclusion: Diluting CM to 20% resulted in no laterality differential of FD-PBV imaging, with
left/right quantitative ratios approaching 1.1 (optimal for clinical use).

Introduction
As shown by other means1­4 (e.g., positron
emission tomography, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)), computed tomography
(CT) can be used to determine cerebral
blood volume (CBV) before and after thera-
peutic interventions for acute ischemic
stroke, which may help gauge revasculariza-
tion success.3,4 Recently, animal and human
studies have further demonstrated in this
setting the feasibility and potential benefit
of measuring parenchymal blood volume
(PBV) via C-arm CT equipped with a
flat-panel detector (FD) system.5­8 A self-
expanding stent (to retrieve thrombi) is also
deployed in the interventional suite,9,10 after
which it is important to assess the extent of
restored cerebral blood flow. Using the same
angiographic equipment for diagnostic and
therapeutic purposes could eliminate the
considerable time expended to transport
patients between imaging modalities.
Although requiring substantial volumes of
contrast medium (CM), FD-PBV imaging is
the approach best suited for patients with
acute ischemic stroke.
CT perfusion (CTP) imaging--one of
the techniques widely applied to assess per-
fusion abnormalities of patients with acute
stroke--is expected to improve patient out-
comes using thrombolysis. CTP has certain
advantages over MR perfusion, although
Sasaki et al.11 reported that radiation expos-
ure during CTP may be unexpectedly high.
Therefore, low-dose protocols with de-
noising techniques are essential to maintain
the radiation dose at <200 mGy. The quan-
titative characteristics of CTP data, how-
ever, are unreliable. Man et al.12 compared
PCT and MRI perfusion and found that the
mean transfer time and CBF values are
affected by the deconvolution method used
(p < 0.05), whereas CBV values remain
unchanged. When applying these various
thresholds, however, the predicted ischemic
core and penumbra were similar with the
two methods. Thus, the predicted ischemic
core and penumbra are similar with these
methods when using different thresholds,
specific for each deconvolution method.
The aim of this study was to determine
a concentration of intra-arterial injectable
CM optimal for quantifying FD-PBV
images, thereby reducing overall CM usage.
Materials and methods
Patients
Between February 2013 and August 2014,
a total of 10 patients (9 women, 1 man) with
a median age of 58.1 years (range 40­71
years) qualified for this retrospectively
study as each had a single unruptured
aneurysm (average diameter, 5.7 mm,
range, 3­12 mm). Two of the aneurysms
were atop the basilar artery (BA-Top), six
involved the internal carotid­posterior com-
municating artery (IC-PCA), one was at the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation,
and one affected the anterior communicat-
ing artery (ACA) (Table 1). Patients were
scheduled for FD-PBV and MRI perfusion
studies within <24 h after granting informed
consent. Measuring the perfusion with MRI
is a morphological evaluation that provides
functional information and improves the
diagnostic ability and treatment orientation.
This study was compliant with the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act. Our institutional ethics committee
approved the study prior to initiating data
collection. The study was performed accord-
ing to the guidelines of our facility.
Contrast value for comparison of right­left
common carotid artery
FD-PBV acquisitions were obtained via a
biplane FD (30 Â 40 cm) angiography
system (Artis zee BA Twin; Siemens AG
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The
C-arm set gained upfront entry to the right
and left common carotid arteries (CCAs)
and the heart. The lateral C-arm set centered
Kuriyama et al. 465
on the whole skull, with the pig-tail catheter
tip placed at the aortic valve. We positioned
the catheter at the ascending aorta and
started the native run, after which the
bolus-watching angiogram (as described in
reference 10) and the injection of contrast
medium were initiated simultaneously.
When the veins and sinus were visible, we
started the full run. The contrast values for
comparing the right­left CCAs involved
two-dimensional digital subtraction angiog-
raphy (2D-DSA), using a power injector
(Press Pro; Nemoto Co, Tokyo, Japan), and
arranging the FD-PBV time delay. Injector
infusion conditions included a diluted CM
volume of 12 mL, a radiographic delay time
of 0 sec, and a 6.0-mL/sec injection rate.
The CM (Iopamidol 300; Bayer HealthCare,
Osaka, Japan) of choice was diluted to 28%,
24%, 20%, 16%, and 12% with saline,
meaning that there were mixtures of 3.36
CM/8.64 saline (28%), 2.88 CM/9.12 saline
(24%), 2.4 CM/9.6 saline (20%), and so on.
Contrast values for the right and left
CCAs were measured five times, based on a
circular region of interest (ROI), and
expressed as the mean Æ standard deviation
(SD). We determined the ratios of the right
and left CCA contrast values at the various
CM dilutions. In addition, we determined
the duration of scan delay according to the
contrast values, including the time to the
transverse sinus (TS), using color-coded
DSA imaging13 (iFlow software: syngo X
Workplace, Siemens AG Healthcare).
FD-PBV quantitation
FD-PBV was generated from 400 radio-
graphic images with a 5122 matrix (pixel
size 0.15 mm2) obtained during rotation of
the X-ray source approximately 200 within
6 sec. Data sets were transferred to a com-
mercially available workstation (syngo
X Workplace, Siemens AG Healthcare) for
post-processing. The proprietary software
included smoothing algorithms:14,15 bin-
ning, 4 Â 4; kernel, smooth. Exposures
entailed default settings (tube voltage,
70 kV; pulse width, 5 ms; radiation-exposed
dose, 0.360 mGy/pulse; focus size, large) with
an HU kernel type and smooth image
characteristic as the conditions of acquisi-
tion. Dilute CM (90 mL) was injected at
6.0 mL/sec. CM diluted to 28%, 24%, 20%,
16%, and 12% by saline yielded volumes of
25.3 mL, 21.6 mL, 18.0 mL, 14.4 mL, and
10.8 mL, respectively.
The data were post-processed to generate
FD-PBV images using prototype software

(Siemens AG, Healthcare) on a dedicated
research workstation (Leonardo, Siemens
AG, Healthcare). For PBV image process-
ing,16 the subtracted data were normalized
with an input function automatically esti-
mated from the histographic analysis of
the vascular tree. We then performed
color-coding with a standard color table to
generate the PBV color-coded maps for
visualization and interpretation. The PBV
values are expressed in units of ml/1000 ml
of cerebral tissue. PBV values for the ROI
analysis were converted to more commonly
used units of ml/100 g using a simple con-
version factor that takes into account the
cerebral tissue density (1.05 g/ml).
MR-CBV quantitation
MRI perfusion was performed in the trans-
verse plane by gradient-echo sequences using
a 1.5-T MRI scanner (Signa; GE Medical
Systems, Wilmington, MA, USA) with echo
planar sequence parameters as follows: TR/
TE/flip angle, 1500/40/60; field of view,
240 Â 240 mm; slice thickness, 5 mm; matrix,
128 Â 128; in-plane voxel size, 1.8 Â 1.8 mm;
signal bandwidth, 1470Hz/pixel. Prior to
scanning, an 18-gauge intravenous catheter
was placed at the antecubital fossa for con-
trast administration. Imaging took place
during the first pass of a standard bolus
dose (0.1mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dime-
glumine (Eisai Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), with
MRI perfusion images acquired at 1-sec
intervals. Then, 13mL was injected at
3.0 mL/sec and flushed with 30mL of saline
via an MRI-compatible power injector
(SONIC SHOT50; Nemoto Kyorindo Co
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).
Post-processing for MR-CBV image cal-
culations was performed with a Perfusion
Mismatch Analyzer17 devised by the Acute
Stroke Imaging Standardization Group­
Japan. The arterial input function to decon-
volve the dynamic tissue response curve was
determined automatically. Semi-quantitative
output perfusion maps of the cerebral blood
volume (CBV) were obtained for clinical
interpretation. Three ROIs (ACA, MCA,
posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territories)
were assessed by the workstation or by
perfusion mismatch analysis (PMA) in each
hemisphere to include all tissues and vessels.
It covered the same proportion of gray/white
matter for both a normal CBV range and that
of the threshold of an infarct. When feasible,
adjustments were made to achieve hemi-
spheric symmetry.
Data analysis
FD-PBV and MR-CBV images were
depicted as intracranial RGB displays on a
black background (BG). Color-scale analysis
(excluding black) was performed via ImageJ
version 1.43 (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA). A linear two-sided
t-test was performed to assess correlations
between variables. Statistical significance was
set as p < 0.05

The three vascular territories of FD-PBV
and MR-CBV images are shown side-by-
side in Figure 3. There were no significant

differences among them (ACA, p¼ 0.0940;
MCA, p¼ 0.0521; PCA, p¼ 0.0672). Figure 4
shows the ratios for the FD-PBV/MR-CBV
images in RGB color. Beyond a CM dilution
of 16%, the red ratio increased, the blue
ratio decreased, and the green ratio was
unchanged.
Discussion
This study is the first to report quantitative
assessment of FD-PBV imaging using vari-
ous CM dilutions in Asian subjects. A CM
dilution to 20% appears optimal for clinical
use of FD-PBV quantitation.

Contrast value for comparison
right­left CCA
MRI-CBV might not show a laterality of the
contrast value for the right­left brain
because the average CM concentration was
unreliable due to mixing by cardiac activ-
ity.18 In this study, however, we were able
to confirm laterality of the contrast value for
the right­left CCA. When laterality was
not present, the CM volume was circulated
equivalently in the right­left brain. The
symmetrical appearance of the CM is
shown in Figure 1.
Royalty et al.6 described use of a 60%
CM dilution injected intravenously at
3.5 mL/sec, although an 8-sec radiographic
delay proved excessive. There was already
significant enhancement of the basilar artery
at the time of the initial image acquisition in
this canine study. In a clinical study, Lin
et al.10 also used a 60% CM dilution given
via an arterial injection at 1.5 mL/sec.
The time to maximum opacification of the
superior sagittal sinus in 34 patients was
6.0 Æ 2.1 sec. In our cohort, intra-arterial
injection of diluted CM at 6 mL/sec required
7.9 Æ 0.7 sec, on average, for maximum
opacification of the superior sagittal sinus,
and the related standard deviation was less
than that cited by Lin et al.10. The time
required for the superior sagittal sinus to
reach full opacity might vary according to
the total amount used, the dilution of the
CM administered, and the positioning of
the angiographic catheters. Thus, we antici-
pate that a 9-sec radiographic delay would
allow sufficient whole-brain dissemination
of CM (Figure 1).
Regarding the injection rate, Rumberger
et al.19 investigated varying intravenous
injections to determine whether faster injec-
tion was preferable for a set volume of CM
and whether diluted CM, injected at an

equivalent volume, conferred similar results.
Ishida et al.18 likewise studied a human
cohort, finding no significant improvement
by increasing the intravenous injection rate
from 4 mL/sec to 5 mL/sec. In a study of
swine, Ganguly7 determined that a higher
intra-arterial injection rate produced better
results, presumably due to better flow and
improved mixing of CM in the carotid
arteries and less loss of iodinated contrast
in subclavian arteries at the higher flow
rates, which at most were 4-6 mL/sec. The
contrast values of the right and left CCAs,
shown in Figure 1, did not differ
significantly at 20% CM (p ¼ 0.0746). With
no laterality differential, equivalent PBV
imaging is therefore expected.
FD-PBV and MR-CBV comparison
In each of the 10 patients studied, the
catheters were consistently positioned at
the aortic valve, near the frontal FD, and
no acute ischemia stroke or stenotic vessel
was encountered. The similar vascular terri-
tories of FD-PBV and MR-CBV determin-
ations (ACA, p ¼ 0.0940; MCA, p ¼ 0.0521;
PCA, p ¼ 0.0672) are shown in Figure 4 Still,
Figure 4. FD-PBV/MR-CBV ratio in the RGB scale. MR-CBV image represents the amount of contrast
medium inflowing and outflowing. Thus, a laterality differential of the CBV was not seen for either cerebral
hemisphere, as shown in Figure 1. According to contrast values for comparison of the right­left CCA, we
confirmed that no laterality differential was seen between CCA and VA during aortic artery flow. FD-PBV is a
color-coded image that represents the quantity of the contrast medium. relative blood flow. Red ¼ high
relative blood flow. Blue ¼ low relative blood flow. To compare FD-PBV with MR-CBV could enable a
relatively fixed-quantity evaluation.

the relations are marginal. Greater clarity
may be achieved by enlisting a larger patient
population (e.g., !30 subjects). Lin et al.13
reported that the ability to measure CBV in
the angiography suite facilitated the follow-
ing situations: (1) when there is a significant
delay between the diagnosis and the begin-
ning of the endovascular procedure; (2) if a
procedure has been too long or unsuccessful,
the operator can assess the evolution of the
infarct core; (3) being able to identify
the prognostic factors and rule out hemor-
rhage immediately after finishing the pro-
cedure. If we want to use this new imaging
modality as a first-line tool, we should use
a pig-tail catheter (which is potentially dan-
gerous) instead of an intravenous approach,
which is minimally invasive. Measurement
of the CBV and cerebral flow in an angiog-
raphy room might be a useful tool for
emergency cases, such as a patient with
acute stroke.
Reducing the amount of CM in both
diagnostic and interventional procedures is
an important issue, especially for elderly
patients. FD-PBV affords easy laterality
of imaging,5­8 depending on the position of
the catheter and acquisition timing, among
other factors. The contrast values of the
right­left CCA may be symmetrical using
CM at low concentrations and a high injec-
tion rate. At our facility, we always
have CM (100 mL) ready when DSA for
cerebral endovascular treatment is sched-
uled. Should the patient suffer a cerebral
event or need an FD-PBV study, CM may
be added. FD-PBV imaging enables evalu-
ation of both the physiological and cerebral
perfusion states of patients in the angiog-
raphy suite before, during, and after thera-
peutic interventions.
All color maps17 delineating FD-PBV
and MRI-CBV were based on default ran-
ges--whether software- or PMA-generated.
In Figure 3, FD-PBV images at 16% CM
dilution showed an increase in the red ratios
and a decrease in blue ratios, with the green
ratio unchanged. Compared with its 20%
counterpart, the 16% CM dilution was
inadequate for color-scale depiction of FD-
PBV. In Figure 2, if we think in images ``G'',
``H'', ``I'', and ``J'', only image noise is
visible--nothing else. Thus, the color ana-
lyzed showed a different malignancy at
!20% CM concentration. In the future, we
believe that this application will be devel-
oped so that MR-perfusion-CBV and CT-
perfusion-CBV are equivalent.
Royalty et al.6 obtained qualitative and
quantitative measurements of CBF and
CBV via C-arm CT acquisition, injecting
28 mL of CM at 3.5 mL/sec. The radio-
graphic delay time was detailed, and CM
was simply flushed by the saline. Cigarroa
et al.,20 however, determined an upper limit
for CM volume based on the following
formula,21 to preclude a high incidence of
nephropathy:
CM limit ¼
5 mL contrast=kg body weight
Â300 mL maximum
ð Þ
 
serum creatinine mg=dL
ð Þ
Thus, we must reduce the CM volume
during cerebral endovascular treatments.
Limitations
Limitations of this study include a small
patient group, so the outcomes are useful
only as a reference for initial comparisons.
In addition, although this study concluded
that a CM dilution to 20% resulted in no
laterality differential of FD-PBV imaging,
with left­right quantitative ratios approach-
ing values of 1:1, we did not compare the
asymmetry in the PBV images--only the
CM ratio at the CCA. Therefore, it is
difficult to reach conclusions. We also used
MR perfusion imaging as a control, which
varies among individuals and is affected by
several factors. Higher correlation with the
MR-CBV image does not mean it is better.
Finally, it has become increasingly evident
472 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
that color mapping is of limited value as a
research tool.
Conclusions
We investigated serial reductions in CM
concentrations for use in FD-PBV imaging.
The most important goal is not to create an
asymmetrical image. At 20% CM dilution,
no imaging laterality differential was
observed, with the left­right quantitative
ratio approaching 1:1. Therefore, this study
may support a reduction of CM if the results
can clearly show that the doses are optimal.
