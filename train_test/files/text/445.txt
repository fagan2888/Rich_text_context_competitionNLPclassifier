WITH increasing longevity has come increased inter-
est, among researchers and the lay public alike, in
understanding the factors that influence risks for cognitive
decline and impairment at older ages. One such factor ap-
pears to be one's level of social engagement --a term we
use to refer broadly to both quantitative and qualitative as-
pects of social interaction, A growing body of evidence sug-
gests that greater social engagement is associated with
significantly lower risks for cognitive decline and dementia
in older adults (Fratiglioni, Paillard-Borg, & Winblad,
2004). The question of whether such associations are evi-
dent across the life course (e.g., earlier in adulthood as well
as at older ages) has not been examined.
Among older adults, longitudinal cohort studies have
documented significant relationships between greater so-
cial integration (i.e., larger social networks) and less risk
of cognitive decline (Barnes et al., 2007; Bassuk, Glass, &
Berkman, 1999; Holtzman et al., 2004; Zunzunegui,
Alvarado, Del Ser, & Otero, 2003). Two studies included
longitudinal social engagement data and found greater
cognitive declines in older adults who reported consis-
tently low or decreasing levels of social engagement (Bassuk
et al., 1999; Holtzman et al., 2004). Studies also have re-
ported a significant relationship between greater social
activity and lower subsequent risk of cognitive decline
(Beland, Zunzunegui, Alvarado, Otero, & Del Ser, 2005;
Bosma et al., 2002; Lovden, Ghisletta, & Lindenberger,
2005; Menec, 2003; Richards, Hardy, & Wadsworth,
2003; Yen, Yang, Shih, & Lung, 2004; Zunzunegui et al.,
2003), although two studies did not find such a relation-
ship (Aartsen, Smits, van Tilburg, Knipscheer, & Deeg,
2002; Hultsch, Hertzog, Small, & Dixon, 1999). Two
studies of older adults also have linked greater reported
support from others to lower risk of cognitive decline
(Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, & Berkman, 2001; Zunzunegui
et al., 2003), whereas a third found that greater loneliness
was associated with increased risk of decline (Tilvis et al.,
2004). Notably, these studies reflect a range of popula-
tions and cultures from the United States (Barnes et al.,
2007; Bassuk et al., 1999; Scarmeas, Levy, Tang, Manly,
& Stern, 2001), Sweden (Fratiglioni, Wang, Ericsson,
Maytan, & Winblad, 2000; Wang, Karp, Winblad, &
Fratiglioni, 2002), France (Beland et al., 2005; Helmer
et al., 1999), Germany (Seidler, Bernhardt, Nienhaus, &
Frolich, 2003), Spain (Zunzunegui et al., 2003), and Taiwan
(Yen et al., 2004) and show links between social engage-
ment and better performance in multiple major cognitive
domains, including recall/memory tasks (Bosma et al.,
2002; Ertel, Glymour, & Berkman, 2008; Hultsch et al., 1999;
Richards et al., 2003), verbal fluency (Bosma et al., 2002;

Objectives. To evaluate whether social contacts, support, and social strain/conflict are related to executive function and
memory abilities in middle-age and older adults.
Methods. Longitudinal data on social contacts, support, and strain/conflict were examined in relation to executive
function and memory at ages 35­85 years using data from the national Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) study. Age-related
differences in patterns of association were also examined.
Results. Regression analyses, controlling for age, sex, race, education, chronic health conditions, and health behav-
iors, revealed significant positive associations between histories of greater social contacts and support and both executive
function and episodic memory, whereas declines in social contacts were negatively associated with both outcomes.
Greater average reported frequency of social exchanges characterized by strain or conflict was negatively associated with
executive function but not episodic memory. Patterns were generally consistent across different age groups; where differ-
ences were seen, associations were stronger in younger age group.
Discussion. Positive and negative aspects of social relationships are related to cognition throughout adulthood, con-
sistent with the hypothesis that social factors have life-long influences on cognition. Positive and negative aspects of so-
cial engagement may thus be important factors to consider in relation to efforts to promote optimal cognitive development
and cognitive aging.
Key Words: Executive function--Memory--Social support--Social engagement.

Hultsch et al., 1999), executive function (Bosma et al.,
2002), and processing speed (Hultsch et al., 1999).
The hypothesis that features of our social environments
can impact on cognitive functioning, and do so not just in
older age but throughout the life course, fits within a broader
theoretical (and empirical) literature on the evolution of
man as a social animal living in groups, resulting in a highly
evolved "social brain"--a brain that both allows us (with
varying individual degrees of success) to develop and main-
tain relationships with others (Burns, 2006; Dunbar, 2003;
Grossmann & Johnson, 2007) and that is in turn attentive to
and influenced by our interactions with others. Over the past
several decades, a growing body of evidence has high-
lighted the salience of social relationships to multiple as-
pectsofhealthandwell-being(i.e.,greatersocialintegration/
support being associated cross-sectionally and longitudi-
nally with better physical and mental health and greater lon-
gevity (Baumeister & Sommer, 1997; Cohen & Syme,
1985; Seeman, 1996). Mechanisms through which social
relationships are thought to affect health (including cogni-
tive "health") include social influences on brain development
(Network, 2005; Smyke et al., 2007) as well as life-long
influences on the brain's cognitive­emotional interpretation
of (and responses to) stimuli and the resulting patterns of
physiological activity in major biological regulatory sys-
tems that in turn affect risks for most major health condi-
tions, including cognition (DeVries, Glasper, & Detillion,
2003; Hofer, 1987, 1995; McEwen, 2007; McEwen &
Seeman, 1999; Seeman, McEwen, Rowe, & Singer, 2001).
Similar to animal "enrichment" models (Diamond, 2001;
Fillit et al., 2002), greater social interaction/engagement
may also contribute to better cognitive functioning across
the life course at least in part as a result of the cognitive
demands associated with such interactions, including de-
mands on cognitive processes such as attention, reasoning,
language, executive function, and speed of processing.
Data from the Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) study offer a
unique opportunity to examine relationships between pat-
terns of social engagement over a decade and subsequent
levels of adult cognition and to do so for a cohort ranging in
age from younger adults in their 30s to older adults in their
70s and 80s. We sought to test the hypothesis that patterns of
social engagement would be related to adult cognitive func-
tioning in all age groups. The MIDUS data offer the advan-
tage of including assessments of quantitative aspects of
social engagement (i.e., extent of social contacts/relation-
ships) along with assessments of both positive and negative
qualitative aspects of those relationships. The availability of
information on not only positive/supportive qualities of indi-
viduals' social relationships but also negative features of
those same relationships (e.g., levels of social strain and
conflict) provides a unique opportunity to assess the hypoth-
esis that unlike supportive interactions (which are hypothe-
sized to generate patterns of cognitive­emotional and
physiological activation that will support better cognitive
functioning), social strain/conflict will be associated with
patterns of cognitive­emotional and physiological activation
that will negatively impact on cognition. Existing evidence
from both laboratory-based studies of the physiological and
cognitive­emotional consequences of social conflict as well
as population-based surveys linking reported levels of social
conflict to profiles of physiological activity provides support
for the hypothesis that social conflict/strain results in pat-
terns of physiological arousal known to be associated with
increased health risks (i.e., increases in blood pressure, in-
flammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and sym-
pathetic nervous system arousal; Seeman & McEwen, 1996;
Uchino, Cacioppo, & Kiecolt-Glaser, 1996). MIDUS also
allows for controls for major potential confounders such as
education, health status, and health behaviors that have pre-
viously been related to both social engagement (Glass, De
Leon, Bassuk, & Berkman, 2006; Okun & Keith, 1998;
Ryff, Singer, & Palmersheim, 2004; Seeman, Bruce, &
McAvay, 1996; Zunzunegui et al., 2003) and cognition (Col-
combe & Kramer, 2003; Potter & Steffens, 2007; Waldstein,
2000; Whitfield et al., 2000).
Methods
The MIDUS study was initiated in 1994/1995 (MIDUS
I). The original sample (N = 7,108) included respondents
aged 25­74 years. Though national in scope, the original
MIDUS cohort was not strictly speaking nationally repre-
sentative. Like many such surveys, it underrepresented
those at the extremes of the socioeconomic status (SES)
continuum but did encompass a majority of the SES diver-
sity within the U.S. adult population. A second wave of data
collection was initiated in 2005/2006 (MIDUS II), includ-
ing a new telephone protocol to assess cognitive function.
As detailed in Radler and Ryff (2010), similar to other lon-
gitudinal studies, among the 4,963 participants reassessed
at Wave 2, higher retention was found for Whites, women,
and those with better health and higher education. Analyses
also indicated that health status predicted retention more
strongly among older individuals, whereas SES better pre-
dicted retention among those with lower functional health
status (Radler & Ryff, 2010).
Cognitive Function
After a brief hearing check, cognition was assessed using
the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT),
which includes six accuracy measures of key domains of
cognitive aging: episodic memory (immediate and delayed
word list recall), working memory (digits backward), exec-
utive function and semantic memory (category fluency),
reasoning (number series completion), and speed of pro-
cessing (backward counting). Additionally, the Stop and Go
Switch Task (SGST) provides both accuracy and latency
measures of cognitive function; in the following analyses,
HISTORIES OF SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND ADULT COGNITION i143
we focus on task-switching latencies (averaged over switch
and nonswitch trials). In order to assess response latencies
and ensure that participants were performing the task as di-
rected, the latencies data were filtered to exclude individu-
als who did not meet 75% or better accuracy criteria on each
task condition (for more detailed information, see Tun &
Lachman, 2006, 2008).
The dependent variables reflect two summary measures of
cognitive function based on exploratory and confirmatory
factor analysis of the BTACT measures and task-switching
latencies from the SGST (Lachman,Agrigoroaei, Murphy, &
Tun, 2010). The episodic memory measure comprised scores
on immediate and delayed word recall; the remaining BTACT
items and SGST latency measures comprise an executive
function score (Lachman et al., 2010; Tun & Lachman, 2006,
2008). Each summary score was computed as a mean of the z
scores for the respective tests. The two means were also stan-
dardized to z scores, with a mean of 0 and a SD of 1. Cogni-
tive outcome data were available for 3,195 participants for
executive function and for 3,530 participants for episodic
memory; those excluded from the current analyses tended to
be older (executive function outcome only), non-White, less
educated, and in poorer health (data not shown).
Social Engagement
Three aspects of social engagement were assessed at both
MIDUS I and II: frequency of social contacts and extent of
reported social support and social strain/conflict. Social
contacts were assessed as the sum of the frequency of con-
tact (never or hardly ever, less than once per month, about
once per month, 2­3 times per month, once per week, about
once a day, and several times per day) across two domains:
family and friends.A sum score of social contacts was given
only if information for both family and friends was avail-
able. Social support was created as the average of responses
regarding "how much" spouse, other family, and friends are
sources of understanding, caring, appreciation, and provide
emotional, reliance, and esteem support based on response
categories ranging from not at all, a little, and some to a
lot (Cronbach's alpha = .90 for both M1 and M2 scale
scores). Using the same range of responses, social strain/
conflict was measured as the average of responses regarding
how often spouse, other family, and friends are sources of
demands, criticism, tension/arguments, or let you down or
annoy you (Cronbach's alpha = .89 for both M1 and M2
scale scores). For both social support and social strain/con-
flict, mean scores were not created if more than two of the
three domains queried (spouse, family, and friends) were
missing data. Correlations among the three aspects of social
engagement ranged from very low to moderate at most,
with more contacts related to greater support (r[M1] = .32;
r[M2] = .39) and greater conflict (r[M1] = .05; r[M2] =
.02), whereas greater support was associated with lesser
conflict (r[M1] = -.40; r[M2]= -.37).
To assess cumulative social engagement across these
three domains, averages of MIDUS I and II scores for each
domain were created. If one time point was missing data,
the score from the available time point was imputed as the
average score because those with data from both time points
provided strong evidence that a majority of adults exhibited
substantial stability over time in all domains with T1­T2
correlations of .44 for contacts, .59 for support, and .59 for
conflict.
Covariates
Selection of covariates for inclusion in the current analy-
ses was based on prior evidence, suggesting that they could
be potential confounders (i.e., that they have been related
to both social engagement; Glass et al., 2006; Okun &
Keith, 1998; Ryff et al., 2004; Seeman et al., 1996;
Zunzunegui et al., 2003; and cognition; Colcombe &
Kramer, 2003; Potter & Steffens, 2007; Waldstein, 2000;
Whitfield et al., 2000). Sociodemographics included age
(in years), gender (coded 1 for female), education, and race
(Black/African American, Native American/Aleutian Island/
Eskimo, Asian or Pacific Islander, "other," and multiracial
compared with the reference category of "White"). Educa-
tion was assessed based on a six-category degree-based
measure ranging from "less than high school" to "PhD,
EDD, MD, and other professional degree." Health status
was assessed based on (a) self-reports of major chronic
conditions based on indicator variables for reports of heart
disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes; (b) reported
number of activities of daily living disabilities (0­6); and
(c) a measure of depression based on the screening version
of the major depression section of the World Health Orga-
nization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(Kessler, Mickelson, Walters, Zhao, & Hamilton, 2004),
reflecting reports of being sad, blue, or depressed or loss of
interest in most things all day or most of the day nearly
every day for 2 weeks as well as at least four other associ-
ated symptoms, including problems with eating, sleeping,
energy, concentration, feelings of self-worth, and thoughts
of death; this variable is score present (1) or absent (0).
Health behaviors included smoking status (coded as for-
mer smokers and current smokers, each compared with ref-
erence category of nonsmokers) and physical activity
(assessed based on an ordinal measure indicating level of
highest reported activity). Separate indices of activity were
created for MIDUS I and II due to differences in available
items with additional items at MIDUS II allowing for iden-
tification of light activity where only moderate and vigor-
ous could be identified at MIDUS I (M1 index range = 0­3,
no reported activity, only moderate activity, infrequent vig-
orous activity, and frequent vigorous activity vs. M2 index
range = 0­4, no reported activity, only light activity, only
light or moderate activity, infrequent vigorous activity, and
frequent vigorous activity).

Analyses
We examined relationships for each of the three domains
of social engagement to each of the cognitive outcomes us-
ing generalized linear mixed models (SAS 9.2 software) in
order to account for clustering at the family level because
834 participants in the analytic sample were siblings of
other participants. We examined both continuous and cate-
gorical (quartile)-based measures for the social engagement
domains (examining indicator/flag variables for each quar-
tile relative to the "best"--high contacts or support, low
conflict) to evaluate possible nonlinearities in the relation-
ships to cognition. Results are presented here only for the
continuous social engagement measures as no evidence for
nonlinearities was seen. Results are reported based on stan-
dardized coefficients (i.e., unit change in outcome per stan-
dard deviation difference on social engagement [or other]
index). Covariates were added in steps to observe changes
in the relationship between cognition and the social engage-
ment variables, adjusting first for major sociodemographic
characteristics, then for health status, and lastly for health
behaviors. Hommel adjustment was applied to account for
the multiple testing associated with primary analyses of av-
erage social influences (two outcomes and three major pre-
dictors), and analyses of effects of changes in social factors
(four predictors and two outcomes; Hommel, 1988) tests for
age interaction were treated as exploratory and were not ad-
justed for multiple testing.
Drawing on the unique range of adult ages within the
MIDUS cohort, we tested for differences in relationships by
age, with particular attention to whether patterns of associa-
tion observed in previous work among older adults would
be seen among younger MIDUS adults. For each cognitive
outcome, tests for interactions between each social domain
and age were examined, including age-by-social domain in-
teraction terms with age centered at the sample mean.
We also assessed the effect of changes in social engage-
ment over time in two ways. For our measure of social con-
tacts, where change scores are integers reflecting changes
across categories, we fit models where the change from M1
to M2 was categorized into dummy variables: down three
points from M1 and up three points from M1 versus no
change (reference group); difference of three points was se-
lected based on both a priori desire to identify those with
greatest reported change as well as examination of actual
change distribution to ensure adequate sample sizes in both
"change" groups. For the measures of social support and
social strain/conflict, where continuous mean scores were
available, we fit linear regression models using the social
engagement score at M1 with a measure of continuous
change in social engagement from M1 to M2 (as measured
by M2 score - M1 score). Because methodologists have
suggested that adjusting for the baseline level of a risk fac-
tor, when studying the effect of risk factor change on dis-
ease risk, can lead to overestimates of effect (Cain, Kronmal,
& Kosinski, 1992), we repeated the multivariable analyses,
adjusting for the mean of the baseline and final values--an
approach that underestimates effects of change--to assess
the stability of our findings relating to the effects of change.
Results
Table 1 provides descriptive information for those in-
cluded in the present analyses (i.e., with complete data on
all variables used in the analyses) along with comparative
statistics for the more complete group of all those seen at
MIDUS II. There are few, if any, differences between our
analysis sample and the overall MIDUS II cohort. At the
time of their MIDUS II assessments, the analysis sample
ranged in age from 32 to 84 years with an average age of
56.3 years. The sample was predominantly White (92.3%),
with 55.3% women. Just over 38% reported attaining a
Bachelor's degree or more with another 28.5% reporting
some college or an Associates degree; only 5.4% had not
attained at least a high school or General Education Devel-
opment degree. Average reported levels of social contacts,
support, and conflict show high levels of stability from
MIDUS I to II: social contacts (M1: mean = 11.5, range =
2.0­16.0; M2: mean = 11.6, range = 2.0­16.0), social sup-
port (M1: mean = 3.4, range = 1.5­4; M2: mean = 3.5, range =
1.3­4.0), and social strain/conflict (M1: mean = 2.1, range =
1.0­4.0; M2: mean = 2.0, range = 1.0­3.8). Mean differ-
ences between MIDUS I and II were small: -0.14 for social
contact score (SD = 2.58), 0.04 for social support (SD =
0.41), and -0.08 for social strain/conflict (SD = 0.39).
Both executive function and episodic memory exhibited
the expected age differences in cognitive performance, with
poorer performance seen in the older age groups (see Figure 1)
Regression models for executive function revealed the
expected patterns of association for our measures of social
engagement. Higher average reported social contacts and
support were associated with better executive functioning,
whereas higher average reported social strain/conflict was
associated with poorer executive function. As shown in
Table 2, these relationships remained significant for with
sequential controls for age (Model 1) and other sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, including education (Model 2); con-
tacts and conflict/strain also remain significant with further
controls for major health conditions and health behaviors
(Model 3), though estimates of the change in R2 associated
with the social factors alone are small (ranging from 0.4
[social conflict] to 1.4 [social contacts]). Parallel analyses
for episodic memory revealed significant positive associa-
tions for social contacts and support in all models (seeTable 3),
though again estimated changes in R2 are small (social con-
tacts = 2.8; social support = 0.2). Reported levels of social
strain/conflict were not significantly related to episodic
memory in any models. When all three domains of social
engagement were examined simultaneously, more social
contacts and lower social strain/conflict each remained
significantly associated with better executive function
HISTORIES OF SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND ADULT COGNITION i145
(B = 0.039, p = .01 for social contacts; B = -0.046, p = .003
for social strain/conflict). Both social contacts and support
remained independently and positively associated with
episodic memory (B = 0.035, p = .04 for social contacts;
B = 0.037, p = .05 for social support)
Tests for age interactions revealed significant interactions
with respect to executive function for social support
(B = -0.271, p = .03) and social strain/conflict (B = 0.212,
p = 0.002) and for social strain/conflict (B = 0.185, p = 0.02)
with respect to episodic memory. Figure 2 (executive func-
tion) and Figure 3 (episodic memory) illustrate the patterning
of these age interactions, plotting the associations at age
55 years (mean age) and those at 1 SD (approximately
12 years) above and below the mean. As shown, these age
interactions reflected stronger patterns of associations
among younger participants.
A final set of analyses examined whether and how
changes in reported social engagement were related to the
two cognitive outcomes. As shown in Table 4, once adjusted
for multiple comparisons, only declines in social contacts
were significantly related to both executive function and
episodic memory outcomes, independent of all covariates.

Those reporting a decrease in frequency of contacts from
MIDUS 1 (baseline) to MIDUS II exhibited poorer execu-
tive function and poorer memory performance. Analyses
controlling for average social engagement rather than base-
line yielded weaker though basically similar results (data
not shown).
Discussion
Analyses of MIDUS social engagement and cognition
data revealed significant positive associations between aver-
age reported contacts and support and measures of both ex-
ecutive function and episodic memory, independent of age,
education, gender, and race as well as major health condi-
tions and health behaviors. Extending prior work, examina-
tion of possible links between reported frequency of
negative social exchanges such as excessive criticism and
demands or perceptions that others "let you down" and cog-
nition also revealed that greater frequency of such social
strain/conflict was significantly and negatively associated
with executive function but not episodic memory. Longitu-
dinal social engagement data also revealed that declines in
social contacts over the decade between MIDUS I and II
were associated with poorer executive function and epi-
sodic memory performance.
The wide age range in the MIDUS cohort (35 years and
older at the time of the cognitive assessments) also allowed
us to test the hypothesis that associations between social
engagement and cognition previously documented for older
adults would be evident at younger ages as well. Consistent
with this hypothesis, we found significant positive associa-
tions between social contacts and support and both cogni-
tive outcomes for those younger than the age of 65 years.
Social strain/conflict was also significantly associated with
poorer executive function and marginally associated with
poorer episodic memory in this younger age group. For
those older than the age of 65 years, we also found signifi-
cant positively associations between social contacts and
both executive function and episodic memory. For episodic
memory, effect sizes for social support and conflict were
similar to those seen among the younger age group but were
not statistically significant due to larger standard errors.
Formal tests for age interactions revealed that associations
were significantly stronger among the younger adults for
social support and conflict with respect to executive func-
tion and stronger for social strain/conflict with respect to
episodic memory.
The overall pattern of these findings is consistent with a
life course model for social engagement influences on cog-
nition wherein social influences are evident not only at
older ages but across the life course. MIDUS data show that
among adults aged 32 years and older, those reporting
higher average social contacts and social support (based on
assessments approximately a decade apart) performed sig-
nificantly better on tests of executive function and episodic
memory, whereas higher average reported frequency of so-
cial strain/conflict was associated with significantly poorer
performance. Changes over time were also associated with
differences in cognitive performance with declines in con-
tact (i.e., reductions in exposure to "positive factors") asso-
ciated with poorer performance. Though not statistically
significant when accounting for multiple comparisons, there
was suggestive evidence that increases in support (i.e., in-
creased exposure to a "positive factor") were associated
with better performance.
Though the MIDUS data provide support for our original
hypothesis that social engagement would be associated with
better cognition at younger as well as older ages, the fact
that a number of the associations were stronger among the
younger member of the MIDUS cohort was unexpected.
Possible reasons for the stronger associations among those
younger than the age of 65 years may include the greater
attrition among the older adults from baseline to MIDUS II
(when the cognition assessments were made) such that
those with the poorest social engagement histories were less
likely to remain in the cohort by the MIDUS II follow-up
and are thus not included in the current analyses. Had they
remained, one might hypothesize that they would have ex-
hibited the poorest cognition and might have contributed to
stronger associations between poor social engagement and
poor cognition among the older adults. Our pattern of
weaker associations at older ages parallels findings for mul-
tiple other risk factors (e.g., Berry, Ngo, Samelson, & Kiel,
Figure 1. Age-related differences in cognition.
HISTORIES OF SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND ADULT COGNITION i147
2010; Tate, Manfreda, & Cuddy, 1998) and may, like these
others, also reflect in part the greater competing risks at
older ages wherein even those with good profiles of social
engagement are, for example, more likely than their younger
counterparts to have other risk factors that will increase
their risks for poorer cognition. Thus, though we controlled
for a number of known risk factors for poorer cognition
(e.g., health conditions, health behaviors), it is likely that

among the older adults, even those with better profiles of
social engagement have other age-related physiological or
other changes that increase their risks for poorer cognition.
Our inability to control more completely for such factors
may have reduced our ability to demonstrate the benefits of
greater social engagement in the older age groups. Impor-
tantly, the current analyses are, to our knowledge, the first to
examine patterns of association between social engagement

and cognition for those younger than the age of 65 years, so
the findings reported here, though intriguing, require further
investigation to determine their ultimate import.
Interpretation of the overall findings must also include
consideration of several limitations of the MIDUS data.
Foremost is the lack of longitudinal cognition data. With
only a single assessment of cognition at MIDUS II, analyses
presented here provide evidence for "associations" between
histories of social engagement and executive function and
episodic memory as of MIDUS II. Further investigation of
the temporal sequencing of changes in social engagement
and changes in cognition must await future longitudinal cog-
nitive data. Such data will allow (as the current data do not)
for evaluation of the relative strengths of what are, in all like-
lihood, reciprocal relationships between social engagement
and cognition with cognition and changes in cognition im-
pacting on patterns of social engagement even as social en-
gagement itself influences cognition and trajectories of
cognitive aging. The current analyses only allow us to deter-
mine the presence of associations between these two impor-
tant domains without being able to assess the relative strength
of the directionality of their respective influences. For the
majority of the current MIDUS cohort, however, available
cognitive data show performance levels that are suffi-
ciently high that reverse causation--with cognitive function
being sufficiently poor as to negatively impact on social
engagement--would seem less plausible as the primary ex-
planation for the observed association. Only among the old-
est of the MIDUS participants, where cognitive performance
is poorest, might one speculate that patterns of social en-
gagement were potentially more affected by cognitive func-
tioning. Whether and how any reciprocal effects come to be
manifest over the life course, however, awaits further longi-
tudinal data for both cognition and social engagement. Also,
the social engagement data are based on self-reports and thus
could be subject to differential response bias (e.g., if those
with better cognition are more likely to bias their self-reports
toward more positive reporting of social engagement); if so,

this could result in an upward bias in estimates of the asso-
ciation between social engagement and cognition. Finally, as
noted previously, the MIDUS is a national sample with sub-
stantial socioeconomic diversity but is not strictly nationally
representative, and the cognitive data were collected only for
those remaining in the longitudinal cohort, which, like all
longitudinal studies, is positively selected for those who re-
mained healthier and more interested in continuing their par-
ticipation in the study. Thus, the generalizability of our
findings remains to be determined.
These analyses, however, also have a number of signifi-
cant strengths. First, the age range of the cohort allowed for
the first formal tests of the hypothesis that relationships be-
tween social engagement and cognition are not restricted to
older ages but rather are evident much earlier in life. MIDUS
data allowed for testing of these associations among adults
as young as 35 years at the time of the cognitive assess-
ments. Second, the MIDUS data provide particularly rich
information on social engagement, including assessments
of more quantitative aspects such as social contacts as well
as more qualitative features, including frequency of both
positive social exchanges (social support) and negative ex-
changes (social strain/conflict). Also, the social engagement
data are available at two time points approximately a decade
apart, allowing for evaluation of more cumulative aspects of
social engagement (i.e., social histories) as they relate to
cognition. Third, although the cognitive data are only avail-
able at a single time point, the range of measures provides
assessments for key cognitive domains known to be impor-
tant in cognitive aging across the life span. Furthermore, the
innovative telephone-based SGST provided enhanced data
on speed of processing and executive function through as-
sessments of latencies in task switching.
In summary, MIDUS data provide evidence linking three
aspects of social engagement--social contacts, support, and
conflict--to both executive function and episodic memory
in adults ranging in age from 35 to 84 years. Those report-
ing greater average contacts and support performed better
on both types of cognitive tasks, whereas those reporting
greater average frequency of negative social exchanges per-
formed did more poorly. The fact that these associations
were evident in younger adults and that changes in these
features of social engagement are related to performance
points to the potential value of considering more positive
aspects of social engagement such as social contacts and
support in the context of any future efforts to improve or
bolster levels of cognition across the life course. These data
also suggest the importance of taking account of risks stem-
ming from higher levels of social strain/conflict. Clearly,
further research is needed to confirm these initial findings
regarding the associations at younger ages and the impact of
negative social exchanges. The current findings, however,
will hopefully encourage attention to these questions as we
seek to understand how patterns of social engagement im-
pact on cognitive function across the life course and how we
might best leverage such knowledge to enhance cognitive
development earlier in life and reduce risks for cognitive
declines in later life.
