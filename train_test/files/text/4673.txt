Background
Concerns about participation in public life have long been
central to sociology. In Democracy in America, Alexis de
Tocqueville (1847) remarked that
almost the only pleasure of which an American has any idea, is
to take a part in the government, and to discuss the part he has
taken . . . if an American were condemned to confine his activity
to his own affairs, he would be robbed of one half of his
existence. (pp. 271-272)
Tocqueville did not use the term public sphere, but his
description ofAmerican civic life anticipated the more recent
formulation of the public sphere as "a common space in
which the members of society are deemed to meet through a
variety of media . . . to discuss matters of common interest;
and thus to be able to form a common mind about these"
(Taylor, 2004, p. 83). For Tocqueville, as for many scholars
of democracy since, participation in the common space of
the public sphere through public political talk is a crucial part
of self-governance, citizenship, and the formation of politi-
cal will (Dahl, 1989; Dewey, 1927; Habermas, 1989; Turner,
1990).
Yet recent influential social science research documents a
serious participation deficit in American public life. Robert
Putnam (2000) suggests that the rich associational life that
characterized the America of Tocqueville's time has unrav-
eled, loosening the social connections that support the public
sphere. As a recent Contexts article put it, "The ties that bind
are fraying" (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Brashears, 2008).
Similarly, Fung and Wright (2001) claim that efforts to shrink
the "affirmative state" have constrained representative insti-
tutions and limited opportunities for egalitarian participation
in public life. And Lichterman (2005) shows how existing
civic organizations (such as church groups) sometimes limit,
rather than enable, participation in the public sphere.
The Tocquevillian concern about a general participation
deficit is reinforced by studies focusing on how persons
engage (or not) in public political talk. Eliasoph (1998)
shows that even persons who are already members of civic
organizations nevertheless actively practice "avoiding poli-
tics." Overwhelmed by the scale of political problems, and
discouraged by the confrontation and division on display in
public debate, members avoid "political" talk to preserve
"civic etiquette" in their associational groups. Similarly,
Mutz (2006) finds that participation decreases when expo-
sure to alternative political perspectives increases, as people
solve the problem of "mixed political company" by avoiding
confrontation altogether. Americans seem to respond to
problems of public debate by "producing apathy" and mov-
ing political talk to private life (Eliasoph, 1998).
At the same time, a growing interdisciplinary literature in
empiricalpublicspherestudiessuggeststhattheTocquevillian
concern may be misplaced. In contrast to the Tocquevillian
account, which treats participation universally as public talk

Speaking of Participation: A Qualitative
Research Note
Michael S. Evans1
Abstract
While participation in public life is generally agreed to be important for governance and citizenship, scholars focused on
talk-oriented participation (in the Tocquevillian tradition) suggest that there is a participation deficit in the American public
sphere. Qualitative analysis of responses from 60 interview respondents about whether or not they are participants in four
prominent American debates suggests a novel explanation for this apparent deficit: Persons whom analysts classify as non-
participants may believe that they are already participating, because their understanding of participation is not based on public
political talk. Moreover, individual responses about participation vary substantially by debate, suggesting that what counts as
participation is more fluid for respondents than for analysts. Implications for public sphere studies are discussed.

about political issues, the alternative account suggests that
there is no standard set of activities called "participation"
that people do (or not). To take a recent example, Perrin
(2006) includes "thinking and talking" as "citizenship activi-
ties" along with "voting, running for office, demonstrating,
or signing petitions" (p. 19). But, obviously, sometimes
"thinking and talking" are not actually "citizenship activi-
ties." Rather, thinking and talking, like many of the things
that people already do, are variably directed toward political
ends (see, for example, O'Neill, 2010). Likewise, the differ-
ent activities in which people engage are variably public
(e.g., "talking politics," see Gamson, 1992). And in practice,
activities of all sorts are variably treated as "participation" by
social scientists, by political elites, and by the alleged partici-
pants themselves (Cody, 2011; Evans, 2009; Perrin &
McFarland, 2011; Waldner & Dobratz, 2013). From this per-
spective, there cannot be an overarching participation deficit,
because there is no consistent version of "participation" to be
evaluated across all cases.
These two positions on participation seem irreconcilable.
For the Tocquevillians, increasing "participation" in the form
of public political talk is important for creating durable trust
relations that extend into other domains and foster develop-
ment of valuable social capital in communities (Putnam,
2000). But if "participation" describes a contingent and vari-
able configuration of activities, conditions, and descriptions
that reflect relations of power in a particular time and place,
then efforts toward increasing public political talk may rein-
force existing inequalities of access and power (Fraser, 1990;
Mouffe, 1999), provide opportunities for private interests to
capture the processes of public political talk for their own
purposes (Lee, 2007; Lee & Romano, 2013; Walker, 2014),
and ignore possibilities to foster democracy as it is actually
practiced by citizens (Perrin, 2006).
This tension between competing ideas about participation
raises two basic questions for sociologists of the empirical
public sphere. First, how can empirical studies of the public
sphere distinguish some configurations of politics, publics,
and activities as "participation" and not others? Second, and
importantly for the historical foundations of sociology, how
does a more complicated understanding of participation con-
nect to classic Tocquevillian concerns about declining public
political talk, if at all?
Rather than attempt to answer these questions through
theoretical elaboration, this research note instead examines
first-person accounts from actualAmerican persons speaking
about participation. In a recent study of public debates over
stem cell research, human origins, environmental policy, and
the origins of sexuality, 60 respondents answered questions
about whether or not they saw themselves as participants in
each debate. The majority describe participation in terms
consistent with the talk-oriented participation reported by
Tocqueville. Many respondents saw themselves as conven-
tional participants (e.g., arguing in discussion groups). And
many respondents did not see themselves as participants,
describing how they "produce apathy" (e.g., by avoiding
political talk at church, see Eliasoph, 1998).
But a distinct alternative version of "participation"
emerged as respondents spoke of participation in terms of
whatever activities they were already doing (e.g., recycling),
even though such activities are inconsistent with the talk-
oriented participation described in other categories of
responses. Notably, however, this version of participation
only surfaced for some issues, and not for others, even for the
same respondents, suggesting that what counts as participa-
tion is issue-specific, rather than universal or even
respondent-specific.
These empirical findings, though limited in scope, sug-
gest a way forward in reconciling the two approaches.
Existing public debate sets boundaries around which activi-
ties count as participation for each issue, with different issues
producing different configurations of legitimate participa-
tion. But sociological understandings of conventional par-
ticipation and "producing apathy" are useful for evaluating
participation on particular issues, wherein there is general
agreement among actors about what counts as participation.
In the concluding discussion, I consider the implications of
these insights for future research.
Method
Data Collection
The data for this research note come from a larger research
project comparing "ordinary" understandings of public
debate with the actual behavior of elected officials and other
prominent media figures over four issues where religion and
science are both involved: human origins, environmental
policy, stem cell research, and the origins of sexuality. These
issues were selected in advance not only because of their
religion and science content but also because they have sig-
nificant public policy implications (unlike, for example,
debates over the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ). Beyond
these common features, the four issues vary in many respects,
and would be expected to have varying personal significance
to different respondents depending on their life experiences,
interests, and preferences.
To collect data on what "ordinary" persons think about
these debates, I conducted multipart, semi-structured inter-
views with 62 individual respondents across two different
locations in the United States (see sample description below).
As part of these interviews, I asked a series of open-ended
questions to verify that respondents were not elected officials
or media figures, as including such non-ordinary persons
would confound the comparison. I began discussion of each
issue with a set of open-ended questions asking respondents
to describe the debate for me as they understood it, and as
they discussed it with other people (see Table 1). I then
asked, "Do you see yourself as participating in this debate?"
Asking such open-ended questions allowed respondents to
Evans 3
express their own understanding of debate and how they
might, or might not, be participating (see Luker, 2008;
Martin, 2011). Those responses provide the data for this
research note.
Given the consistent finding in the existing literature that
there is an apparent participation deficit in American public
life, I initially expected that most responses to the question
"Do you see yourself as participating in this debate?" would
be "No." But from the earliest interviews, it became clear
that respondents actually often saw themselves as partici-
pants in various public debates, though in different ways and
for different reasons. I recorded the surprising initial
responses in field notes as an interesting theme for later anal-
ysis, but left the interview schedule unchanged to maximize
comparisons across all interviews. Interviews ranged in total
length from 49 min to just over 2 hr, though the amount of
time spent on individual components of each interview var-
ied substantially. All interviews were digitally recorded and
professionally transcribed.
Data Analysis
After completing interviews with all respondents in the sam-
ple, I counted a total of 187 valid responses to the participa-
tion question. In two interviews, the word "participating"
was not used, due to interviewer error, so I omitted those
respondents from this analysis. The number of responses
(187) greatly exceeds the number of respondents (60)
because respondents could (and often did) answer the ques-
tion for multiple issues in each interview. However, not every
respondent answered questions about every issue, so the
number of responses is less than the theoretical maximum.
Of the 187 valid responses, 98 responses (52%) were pos-
itive. Contrary to what reports of participation deficit might
predict, in a (slight) majority of instances, respondents saw
themselves as participants in public debates. I returned to the
transcripts to understand how respondents saw themselves as
participants (or not) in public debate. Using generally
accepted methods of open and axial coding (see Babbie,
1998), I manually analyzed the open-ended responses from
interview transcripts to identify important categories across
respondent answers and to expose the conceptual relation-
ships that underpin those categories.
Sample Description
Respondents were recruited using a snowball approach
seeded with convenient contacts in purposive target groups.
With the limited target size of the sample (approximately 60
respondents), the goal was not to achieve statistical represen-
tativeness, as a random sample might not actually capture
enough different cases to derive useful theoretical insight.
Instead, I sought to maximize range (Weiss, 1994). Because
of the religion and science content of the selected debates, I
formally enforced heterogeneity of religious affiliation and
occupation, but the sample also ranged usefully in other
categories.
Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 79 years (average
40). The sample (with invalid respondents omitted) included
33 women and 27 men. In all, 75% of respondents came from
a Southern California city of more than 1.5 million residents
that is known for high-tech industries and military presence.
The remaining 25% came from a South Florida city of fewer
than 200,000 residents that is primarily known as a tourism
and retirement destination. The overall ratio of White to non-
White respondents (about 3 to 1) approximately matched
that of the U.S. general population, though non-White racial/
ethnic composition varied by site. All respondents had com-
pleted high school, though postsecondary education ranged
from none to PhD, with most respondents having taken at
least some college courses and a majority having earned AA/
AS or BA/BS degrees. In short, though the sample is not
intended to be generalizable, it resembles the U.S. general
population along many dimensions (but not education).
Nevertheless, this is a qualitative analysis, and I do not
attempt general quantitative inferences in what follows.
Results
Respondents spoke of participation in multiple and some-
times overlapping ways. First, respondents varied in how
they described what sorts of talk counted as debate in the first
place. For example, some responses described debate as
"argument" with "people [who] hold different opinions,"
especially in the halls of Congress or the radio airwaves,
while others said that debate was "informed conversation,"
"teaching classes," or just "chatting" in the workplace,
church, or classroom. Second, respondents varied in what
activities counted as participation. For example, some
described participation as "writing letters," "raising money,"
or, more vaguely, "political activism," while others talked
about activities such as "conversation," "giving opinions,"
"learning," or "considering issues." Third, and most obvi-
ously, respondents varied in whether or not they saw them-
selves as participating in a given debate, with "yes" or "no"
answers often (but not always) leading to additional
explanations.

Three qualitative categories emerged as distinct combina-
tions of responses. Responses in each category share a dis-
tinct configuration of ideas about debate, activity, and
participation. Note that these are not simply linguistic dis-
tinctions over the meaning of the word "participation," but
broader categories that encompass understandings of partici-
pation, debate, and activity for specific issues in the public
sphere. I call these three categories "conventional participa-
tion," "producing apathy," and "personal participation."
While responses in the first two categories are consistent
with the Tocquevillian understanding of participation as pub-
lic political talk, responses in the third category are not,
because they describe participation as not public, not politi-
cal, or, most commonly, not talk. Moreover, while responses
fit into these three categories, respondents themselves did
not. Approximately 75% of respondents who answered ques-
tions for multiple issues actually switched from one qualita-
tive response category into another depending on the issue.
In relating these findings below, I use pseudonyms to facili-
tate reporting, but this should not be taken to mean that a
respondent only returned responses in the category in which
they are quoted.
Conventional Participation
The first category of responses combines the elements of
Tocqueville's civic ideal. Responses in this category usually
describe debate as interactive, ranging in setting from small
discussion groups to electoral politics, and sometimes con-
flictual. Relevant activities typically include holding and
giving opinions, especially in small-group settings, as well
as several varieties of activism, such as raising and donating
money, voting, and advocating for causes. Importantly, all
responses in this category contain a "yes" reply to the partici-
pation question. Arthur typifies this category in his answer
about participation in human origins debate:
I have been voting liberal for quite a long time, but I still joined
the Rebuild the Party group and wanted to contribute my ideas.
[T]hey were just collecting all kinds of ideas for what is wrong
with the Republicans.And so I did go online and I did participate
in those debates. You know, by participate I mean, I added
comments to the issues that I had something to say on. And yes,
I basically did tell them like, "Look, drop the young earth
creationists."
Responses in this category usually involve advocating
actively, generating conversations, and otherwise seeking
out ways to form and shape opinions about public issues. For
example, Lewis said, "I've been in the discussion groups that
we have [at church] because I'm definitely in favor of stem
cell research [and] I know people that would seriously ben-
efit." Tamara talked about how she just completed a research
project designed to present her position on the origins of
sexuality, and also recently "went to the AIDS Walk" and
"talked to all sorts of people about [sexuality]." Josefina
"contribute[s] $10.00 a week to Human Rights [Campaign,
an advocacy group] just because I believe it's a human rights
issue in the way people are treated." In short, conventional
participation means actively contributing to public discus-
sion of political issues, through a variety of means and in a
variety of public settings.
Producing Apathy
A second category of responses is consistent with Eliasoph's
(1998) findings about "civic etiquette" (see also Mutz, 2006).
Responses in this category often describe debate as interac-
tive, occurring in a variety of settings, and largely conflic-
tual. Respondents discuss taking part in a variety of social
activities, such as chatting with friends, family, and cowork-
ers, and they often belong to civic groups.
However, respondents do not understand this activity to
be participation. When discussing participation explicitly,
respondents downplay social activities or talk about individ-
ual activities instead, such as "considering issues," "listen-
ing," or "hav[ing] an opinion." This category is characterized
by the deliberate avoidance of public debate.All responses in
this category contain a "no" reply to the participation
question.
Responses in this category often describe a reluctance to
argue or give opinions in public, describing such activities as
pointless or even counterproductive. Daniela, for example,
does not "feel like my voice is shaping the debate across the
country." Raymond describes stem cell debate as "tense and
unproductive." And Judith's response typifies those who
simply feel unable to contribute usefully:
No, I don't seek out this one, probably because I don't personally
even know a lot about it. I don't even know how long it's been
around. So I kind of feel like I'd just be hurting the cause to a
degree to branch off on something that I'm completely wrong on
potentially.
Responses in this category especially emphasize avoid-
ance of the confrontation and conflict that is seen to charac-
terize debate. Penny, for example, describes how she has
"kind of resigned from the debating society." Similarly,
Morgane says that she is "kind of a weenie" and avoids
confrontation. Morris emphasizes that he is "not a
crusader."
This work of "producing apathy" (Eliasoph, 1998) contin-
ues even when respondents recognize that participation
might be seen as desirable. As Phoebe put it, "I am so unin-
volved. It's horrible." Yet responses consistently indicate
that the benefits of avoiding debate outweigh the benefits of
participation. Oscar sums it up as "You know, no. I'm a live
and let live guy." In short, producing apathy means recogniz-
ing participation as public political talk, but consciously and
actively not participating, and instead retreating from con-
flictual public debate, even when otherwise involved in civic
or social activities.
Evans 5
Personal Participation
While the previous two categories account for a majority of
responses, analysis also revealed a surprising third category
of participation that is distinct from public political talk.
Much like the previous two categories, responses in this cat-
egory described debate as public, interactive, and sometimes
conflictual. Also, like the "producing apathy" category,
responses emphasized individual activities such as "having
an opinion," "listening," "paying attention," and "setting an
example."
But surprisingly, respondents nonetheless saw themselves
as participants in debate, even when they shared a view of
public debate as conflictual or confrontational, and even
when they described their activities in terms more consistent
with producing apathy rather than conventional participa-
tion. Responses in this category all contained a "yes" answer
to the participation question.
I call this category "personal participation" to capture this
unique response to (perceived) bad debate. For the responses
in this category, respondents produce an alternative version
of participation that is not necessarily public, not necessarily
political, and definitely not talk-oriented. This allows them
to understand themselves as participants, even though their
activities fall outside the realm of public political talk. For
example, Zoe sees herself as participating by relocating
debate from the conflictual public sphere to her individual
thoughts:
Well, I participate more in my own mind. I have some friends
who are definitely against homosexuality, and it's not worth it
for me to bring it up because I know I'm not going to change
their minds and so it'd create a rift between us and so. But it
definitely gets me thinking about things.
Responses in this category largely describe participating
in public debate as such individual activity rather than talk or
interaction. For example, Sterling describes his participation
in environmental policy debate by recounting how he rides
his bicycle to work, recycles, and minimizes water usage,
concluding that "I pay attention to those things, and my
behavior is modified by my attention to them."
But even when responses in this category acknowledge a
broader realm of public talk, they uniformly emphasize indi-
vidual readiness or preparation to talk, rather than starting a
conversation or advocating a position to others. Holly prides
herself on being ready to give an opinion "if asked."
Likewise, Barry describes himself as "aware of arguments,"
while Crystal sees herself as "willing to share [her] perspec-
tive." Grace emphasizes that she does not usually talk to
people, but is instead a "living testimony." Similarly, Chantal
seeks to "set an example" but does not seek out arguments.
In short, personal participation means (re)imagining indi-
vidual activities such as opinion formation or recycling as
legitimate modes of participation in their own right, thereby
turning what might otherwise be apathy over conflictual
public debate into participation.
Switching
Perhaps more surprising than the emergence of the "personal
participation" category is the finding that even though
responses fit into categories, respondents generally do not.
Nor are the three categories of responses evenly distributed
across debates. Instead, what counts as participation varies
by debate, both at the level of individual respondents and at
the aggregate level of debate. At the individual level, many
respondents switch qualitative response categories depend-
ing on the debate being discussed. Of 54 respondents who
answered the question for multiple issues, fewer than 25%
gave consistent (either positive or negative) responses across
issues.
In some cases, the same activity is seen as participation in
one debate, but not in another. For example, Sienna consis-
tently describes "talking to friends and family" as relevant
activity across debates, but only counts this activity as par-
ticipation for environmental policy debate, and not for stem
cell research or human origins debate. But in most cases of
switching, respondents simply understand the relationship
between debate, activity, and participation differently for dif-
ferent debates. For example, in environmental policy debate
Anita participates conventionally, "saying what I think" to
friends and strangers alike, but when it comes to debate over
the origins of sexuality, she produces apathy by avoiding par-
ticipation in debate in favor of "private talk."
Given the diversity of the issues under discussion, in the-
ory this individual switching could be explained in multiple
ways. Respondents might simply have different levels of
commitment to different issues. For example, when discuss-
ing sexuality, respondents often used personal examples
from relationships with family or friends. If "the personal is
political" (Hanisch, 1970), then modes of participation
around this issue might be understood differently than modes
of participation around issues that do not connect to personal
experience and interests in the same way. Another explana-
tion is that individual switching reflects the context of dis-
cussion. For example, in most instances respondents claimed
to talk about issues with friends and family, if they claimed
to talk about an issue at all. But when religious respondents
reflected on who they talked to, they more frequently named
fellow churchgoers and coreligionists for the issue of sexual-
ity than for other issues. For those respondents, it makes
sense that modes of participation in a church setting might be
understood differently than modes of participation in other
settings.
Issue Variation
Individual switching between responses from the same
respondent is noteworthy. But at the aggregate level of
debate, it is apparent that different debates have different
patterns of "participation" across respondents. Even when
issues do not necessarily provoke a personal response, and
even when they do not share a common discussion context
6 SAGE Open
(such as church), debates for each issue tend to be character-
ized by a distinct combination of activities that count as par-
ticipation. Whether or not they see themselves as
participating, respondents tend to associate some activities,
and not others, with participation in debate over a given
issue.
For example, in discussing stem cell research debate,
respondents typically understand participation to mean
"being informed," "talking to friends and family," "giving an
opinion," and occasionally some form of "political activism"
such as "protest" or "going to rallies." Whether or not respon-
dents see themselves as participating, they recognize that
these are the activities that constitute participation in stem
cell research debate. By contrast, in discussing debate over
environmental policy, respondents typically understand par-
ticipation to mean either individual choices that they make,
such as "changing light bulbs," "preserving things in good
shape," and "recycling," or, to a much lesser extent, formal
political activity such as voting. Whether or not respondents
see themselves as participating, they recognize that these are
the activities that constitute participation in environmental
policy debate.
What counts as participation for each debate is not exclu-
sive. Sometimes activities (e.g., "giving an opinion") are
considered participation for several issues. And it is not sim-
ply that some debates are seen as public issues while others
are seen as private issues. For example, neither "being
informed" nor "changing light bulbs" are especially public
activities in their own right. But note that these shared
notions of "participation" are sharply different with regard to
the public sphere. In the case of stem cell research, "partici-
pation" generally involves the conventionally understood
public sphere. But for debate over environmental policy,
"participation" generally means personal activities that
bypass the conventionally understood public sphere
altogether.
So, while there are individual variations and exceptions,
the overall pattern across debate is of distinctive groups of
activities that are (together) considered to be participation
for each issue. On one hand, this is not surprising, as public
debates over particular issues have distinctive histories,
unique trajectories, and characteristic language that shapes
how debates can unfold. But on the other hand, it is surpris-
ing to see how these distinctive features manifest in respon-
dent understandings of their own participation. Certainly
whether or not individuals see themselves as participating
partly depends on the debate under consideration. But more
fundamentally, what can count as participation at all appears
to vary by debate. Respondents do not consistently mobilize
a universal reference definition for participation and evalu-
ate their own activities accordingly. Instead, each debate is
characterized by a distinctive range of acceptable forms of
participation, from which respondents make sense of their
own activities and respond within the constraints of each
debate.
Discussion
This research note has reported novel findings about partici-
pation from a recent qualitative study of multiple public
debates. Two clear findings emerge. First, conventional par-
ticipation and "producing apathy" are empirical categories
that surface only for particular issues in which participation
is understood as a particular configuration of political
engagement and public activities (especially public talk).
Second, each issue sets the boundaries for what counts as
participation. Taken together, these findings suggest a way
forward for evaluating participation deficit in empirical pub-
lic sphere studies.
The obvious implication of these findings is that the
Tocquevillian understanding of participation as public politi-
cal talk should not be considered universal or even general.
In one sense, the qualitative evidence here suggests a reason
that public political talk might actually be in decline. Perhaps
Americans do not participate (in public political talk) because
they already think that they are participating (through vari-
ous individual activities).
But the deeper implication is that concerns about declin-
ing participation need to account for a variety of views of
participation. Instead of starting from a universal
Tocquevillian definition of participation as public political
talk, then judging the failure of Americans to engage in pub-
lic political talk as participation deficit, it makes more sense
to start from the empirical case and judge the success or fail-
ure of Americans to participate based on what counts as par-
ticipation in that empirical case. At a minimum, future
research into (apparent) participation deficit in American
public life should not simply treat participation as obvious
and universal, but should first answer the question, "What
counts as participation here?"
Despite potential misdirection, the Tocquevillian concern
is hardly unfounded. These findings suggest that it should be
multiplied. Each issue and debate may well have its own ver-
sion of participation, and therefore its own version of partici-
pation deficit, to examine. In this study, what counts as
participation (and therefore what counts as participation defi-
cit) varies, even for the same respondent, depending on the
issue under consideration. This finding aligns usefully with
recent research, suggesting that the qualities of a particular
issue set the horizon of possibility for how persons might par-
ticipate in debates about that issue (Perrin & Vaisey, 2008).
Future research with a much larger and more representative
sample would allow exploration of differences between per-
sons and issues regarding what counts as participation and
participation deficit. Such research might usefully distinguish
between effects of individual characteristics and effects of
debate structure, and might identify patterns of participation
across issues that are not visible in this limited study.
Regardless of sample size, future research should also
explore how inequalities of participation are multidimensional
in ways that are not reducible to the individual qualities,
Evans 7
attributes, preferences, or activities of (non-) participants.
When different versions of participation are seen as more or
less legitimate, what counts as participation at all may be a
source of inequality in its own right. And if such legitimacy
depends on the constraints of the issue under debate rather
than (or in addition to) the efforts of individual citizens, then
the possibilities for alternative and more equitable forms of
participation may also be constrained.
