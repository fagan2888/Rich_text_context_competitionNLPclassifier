Abstract: The question of whether and how information is actively transferred from
knowledgeable to ignorant individuals has received much attention in psychology and
evolutionary biology. Research in these fields has proceeded largely independently, with
studies of nonhuman animals focusing on knowledgeable individuals and whether or not
they meet a functional definition of teaching, while studies of children focus on the
learner's assumptions and inferences. We argue that a comprehensive theory of teaching
will benefit from integrating perspectives and empirical phenomena from evolutionary and
developmental disciplines. In this review, we identify cases of seemingly purposeful
information transfer (i.e. teaching) in human and nonhuman animals, discuss what is
known about the cognitive processes that support teaching in different species, and
highlight ways in which each discipline might be informed by extant theories and empirical
tools from the other.

Introduction
One of the primary challenges for a young organism is to learn about the world
around it. Often, knowledge is available in the minds of conspecifics that would be risky,
inefficient, or even impossible to derive through individual exploration of the environment.
Thus, conspecifics can be rich sources of relevant information for a learner. Indeed,
decades of research on humans and other species attest to the centrality of social learning
for the acquisition of adaptive information and skills (see Galef, 1976; Hoppitt and Laland,
2008; Rendell et al., 2011). Observing another's actions can lead a naïve organism to focus
The origins of pedagogy

attention on relevant environmental features (stimulus enhancement), to identify causal
contingencies (affordance learning), or to model the actions or goals of another
(imitation/emulation) (see Galef and Giraldeau, 2001; Hoppitt and Laland, 2008). In these
cases, the learner may exploit information made available by actions the knowledgeable
actor performs for the actor's own immediate benefit, without regard to the audience
(Danchin, Giraldeau, Valone, and Wagner, 2004). Such passive forms of social learning are
observed across diverse taxa (e.g., in fish: Laland, Atton, and Webster, 2011; insects:
Leadbeater and Chittka, 2007; birds: Slagsvold and Wiebe, 2011; primates: Whiten, 2011;
and other mammals: Thornton and Clutton-Brock, 2011).
However, some information may be more effectively transmitted with active
involvement of the knowledgeable individual (Boyd and Richardson, 1985). In teaching,
also referred to as pedagogy, a knowledgeable individual facilitates learning by altering its
behavior in the presence of a naïve observer. Teaching is widespread amongst humans
(Strauss, Ziv, and Stein, 2002), and according to one recent proposal (hereafter, the
"Natural Pedagogy" or "NP" hypothesis), human teaching relies on dedicated mechanisms
that evolved for the purpose of social transmission (Csibra and Gergely, 2009, 2011), and
are unique to our species (Csibra, 2007)1. Alternatively, the ability to learn effectively from
teachers could be acquired over the course of ontogeny via domain-general learning
mechanisms, without requiring genetic adaptations for social transmission2
In parallel to this developmental literature, there has emerged a growing body of
research on teaching in nonhuman animals (for reviews, see Caro and Hauser, 1992;
Thornton and Raihani, 2008). This work is not only relevant for evaluating the claim that
the form of pedagogy observed in humans is species-specific (Csibra, 2007), but also for
understanding the selection pressures that might have given rise to teaching, and the range
of cognitive machinery that might support it. To most evolutionary biologists and
behavioral ecologists, information transfer constitutes a form of teaching if it meets three
. To begin to
distinguish between these possibilities, recent experiments have explored how social-
communicative contexts modulate learning early in human development, generating an
intriguing set of empirical phenomena. However, the representations that support
differential learning in teaching contexts remain poorly understood, and the extent to which
there is continuity in these processes across species is unknown.
1 We do not make a theoretical distinction between teaching and pedagogy. While the term "teaching" is
generally used with nonhuman animals, and the term "pedagogy" reserved for humans, we do not find it
useful to adopt this usage when it is an open question which cognitive processes support the various teaching
phenomena observed across species and over development. Instead, we use these two terms loosely and
interchangeably, aiming to highlight a number of more subtle distinctions necessary to characterize how
different cognitive systems support teaching and pedagogical learning.
2 These are not mutually exclusive accounts. It is possible, for example, that domain-general learning
mechanisms exploit domain-specific perceptual schemas and/or motivational processes (see Heyes, 2012b,d).
Similarly, evolved learning constraints can still exhibit experience-dependent plasticity, perhaps interacting
with knowledge acquired via domain-general learning mechanisms. We highlight these two views as
opposing extremes, acknowledging the nuanced positions between them.

criteria. To qualify as teaching, (1) the knowledgeable individual must modify its behavior
in the presence of a naïve observer, (2) incurring a cost (or at least gaining no immediate
benefit) from doing so, and (3) the observer must acquire knowledge or skills more
efficiently than it otherwise would (Caro and Hauser, 1992)3
Although interest in teaching is shared across evolutionary and developmental
disciplines, these lines of research have operated largely independently, yielding distinct
emphases in each field. Studies of nonhuman animals tend to focus on whether and how a
teacher caters its behavior to an audience to facilitate learning, whereas studies of human
children focus on how the learner's assumptions allow the learner to effectively exploit
pedagogical communication. In this review, we aim to integrate these perspectives by
identifying cases of active information transfer in human and nonhuman animals and
discussing what is known about the mechanisms that support these behaviors. We then
suggest how our understanding of teaching in human ontogeny might take lessons from
evolutionary theories, and from particular examples of teaching in nonhuman species, and
propose ways in which findings and models from developmental psychology could inform
our understanding of the evolution of social transmission mechanisms.
. Phenomena that satisfy these
criteria have been documented infrequently, but there are, nonetheless, examples in several
distantly related nonhuman species (ants, Temnothorax albipennis: Franks and Richardson,
2006; meerkats, Suricata suricatta: Thornton and McAulliffe, 2006; pied-babblers,
Turdoides bicolor: Raihani and Ridley, 2008). We argue that, despite these advances,
further research is needed to understand the cognitive processes supporting teaching in
these species and, in particular, the mechanisms by which naïve individuals learn from
teaching when it occurs.
Learning from Others: Characterizing the Problem
All learners face the problem of generalizing from past observations or experiences
to future, unseen events. Suppose, for example, that we observe that a new toy makes a
novel sound. Given this observation, we must identify the actions or interventions needed
to generate the sound and the set of objects that might share this sound-making property, as
well as make numerous other inferences about whether the toy has additional hidden
properties, and whether the sound is accidental, or central to the object's function.
Recently, Bayesian models have been used as a flexible framework for specifying inductive
inference problems at a computational level (Marr, 1982), formalizing how prior
knowledge in a domain can interact with observed data to support such underdetermined
inferences (Griffiths, Kemp, and Tenenbaum, 2008). While each of the inferences above is
3 Notice that this definition does not provide criteria for differentiating teaching from many forms of
communication that result in learning, including ones we might not readily identify as teaching in humans.
We assume that there exists no hard and fast line between teaching and other such forms of communication,
but that teaching generally communicates declarative or procedural information that generalizes to other
contexts (e.g., "elephants have trunks"), as opposed to transiently relevant, episodic information (e.g., "look,
there is an elephant in the room").
The origins of pedagogy

underspecified by a single observation, learners can make rich, rational inferences on the
basis of limited experience if assumptions are made about the processes by which the
observations have been sampled (Bonawitz et al., 2011; Gweon et al., 2010; Shafto,
Goodman, and Frank, 2012). Consider, for example, observing that the novel toy makes the
sound when on its side, but learning this either from observing the wind blow over the toy,
from a person intentionally placing the toy on its side, or from a person saying "let me
show you how this works" before placing the toy on its side. In the latter pedagogical
context, a rational learner can make especially strong inferences based on assumptions
about others' communicative intentions and tendencies (e.g., that teachers tend to
communicate complete, relevant, and generic information). Computational models of social
learning have used a Bayesian framework to demonstrate that pedagogical instruction
licenses a stronger set of inferences than mere observation of another agent's behavior, so
long as a learner assumes that a teacher is knowledgeable and provides representative,
maximally informative data (Shafto and Goodman, 2008; Shafto, Goodman, Gerstle, and
Ladusaw, 2010; Shafto et al., 2012).
Why Study Teaching in Children?
While these computational models show that a rational learner can generalize
efficiently by making assumptions about pedagogical communication, this does not mean
that all forms of teaching meet these assumptions, nor that making such assumptions is
necessary for a learner to benefit from teaching. A teacher's behavior might directly
modulate attentional or motivational factors that facilitate learning, even if the learner has
no prior assumptions to recruit when interpreting teachings acts. Do children have intuitive
knowledge of pedagogical communication that constrains the inferences made from
information provided in pedagogical contexts? Or does learning from human pedagogy rely
on simpler attentional mechanisms that merely function to highlight relevant, generic
information? Recent studies with human children and infants, reviewed in the following
section, have aimed to distinguish between these possibilities.
These developmental studies also aim to shed light on the origins of receptivity to
pedagogy. One possibility is that children's ability to learn efficiently in social contexts,
and from teaching specifically, is itself learned over the first few years of life. As children
learn specific facts about people and their communicative tendencies, they might construct
a "theory of pedagogy" that supports interpreting and learning from others' pedagogical
acts. The alternative proposed by Csibra, Gergely, and colleagues (the NP hypothesis;
Csibra and Gergely, 2009, 2011) is that human infants have an innate receptivity to
teaching that allows them to capitalize on the information provided in pedagogical
contexts. This would involve genetically-adapted mechanisms for detecting acts of
ostensive communication (via features like direct gaze and infant directed speech), and
inferential constraints, already evident in infancy, that dictate the patterns of generalization
made when these cues are present. Studies of humans across early development provide
one method for examining the contributions of innate structure and experience to the
emergence of effective pedagogical learning (see section titled "Relationship to Cognitive
Architecture" for further discussion of the connection between innateness and specialized
The origins of pedagogy

mechanisms).
Evidence for Receptivity to Teaching in Children and Infants
Do humans in fact learn from teaching by making assumptions about the nature of
pedagogical communication? An emerging body of research suggests that children's
learning is modulated in nuanced ways by the context in which data are obtained, and that
children make uniquely strong inferences under pedagogical conditions. In an experiment
by Bonawitz and colleagues (2011), for example, preschool children viewed an
experimenter demonstrate one of several functional affordances on a novel toy (e.g.,
pulling a squeaker to make a sound) and were then given an opportunity to play
themselves. In some conditions, the experimenter presented the information pedagogically
(e.g., "This is my toy. I'm going to show you how my toy works"). In other conditions, the
same affordance information was provided, but the demonstration violated key pedagogical
assumptions, either because the toy was new to the experimenter, or because the
experimenter was interrupted mid-demonstration. Children in the latter two conditions
tended to explore and discover non-demonstrated functions of the toy. Children in the first
condition, however, restricted exploration to the demonstrated function. These children
apparently assumed that a teacher would communicate the full functionality of the toy, and
thus inferred that the demonstrated affordance was its sole function.
Based on these and related findings (Buchsbaum, Griffiths, Gopnik, and Shafto,
2011; Butler and Markman, 2012; Gelman, Ware, Manczak, and Graham, 2013), it appears
that children make assumptions about the communicative properties of teaching episodes
(e.g., that a pedagogical demonstration will exhaust the functionality of a novel object).
Further evidence that children (and adults) expect teachers to provide complete and
representative information comes from the finding that learners evaluate an individual
negatively for omitting relevant information when teaching others (Gweon, Pelton, and
Schulz, 2011). Thus, by preschool years, children are able to take into account a range of
relevant variables when interpreting communicative acts (i.e., whether the teacher
completed the demonstration or was interrupted), and make flexible inferences about the
relevance and scope of the knowledge provided in these contexts.
The presence of these abilities in human children is consistent with the view that
humans possess an innate adaptation for receiving pedagogical communication, but also
with the view that children construct the relevant assumptions (e.g., that teachers are
knowledgeable and helpful, and communicate complete, relevant, generalizable
information) over the first several years of life. Both views predict that children will learn
efficiently from teachers, but make different predictions about the developmental trajectory
of these pedagogy-specific inferences; the proposal that such inferences are learned implies
an initial period in which infants, new to pedagogical contexts, will fail to make them,
whereas the NP hypothesis predicts that such assumptions will be in place from the earliest
exposure to pedagogical communication.
Attempts by proponents of the NP hypothesis to characterize infants' understanding
of pedagogy focus on two key claims. First, adults tend to communicate with infants in
systematic ways, and it is argued that infants are innately attuned to these behaviors,
The origins of pedagogy
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -555-
leading them to attend preferentially to instances of pedagogical communication (Csibra
and Gergely, 2006). Consistent with this claim of communicative sensitivity, there is ample
evidence that human infants attend to infant-directed speech (Pegg, Werker, and McLeod,
1992) and eye contact (Farroni, Csibra, Simion, and Johnson, 2002) and that these
perceptual sensitivities play a non-trivial role in information transfer, eliciting gaze-
following and joint attention from infants (Deligianni, Senju, Gergely, and Csibra, 2011;
Senju and Csibra, 2008; Senju, Csibra, and Johnson, 2008).
The second, more controversial claim is that infants, like older children, represent
the communicative intent behind these signals and make specific assumptions about the
information being communicated, which guide subsequent processing and generalization of
that information (Csibra, 2010; Csibra and Gergely, 2006, 2009, 2011). According to the
NP hypothesis, the cues described above lead an infant to infer that information
communicated will be shared across individuals, new or relevant to the learner himself, and
generic or kind-generalizable (that is, will hold across instances of a type or category,
rather than pertaining to the current exemplar alone). To support this proposal empirically,
one must show not only that infants learn differently in pedagogical contexts, but also that
they do so via specific assumptions about the information communicated through
pedagogy. Evidence for this second claim rests on several key findings.
First, infants preferentially encode stable, category-relevant features of objects
when engaged communicatively (Yoon, Johnson, and Csibra, 2008). In a violation-of-
expectation paradigm (in which infants look longer at unexpected events), infants were
repeatedly shown events in which a person either pointed to an object (communicative
condition) or reached for it (non-communicative condition), followed by test events in
which the object changed either location or identity. If infants expect that pedagogical
communication will provide new knowledge that generalizes across contexts, ostensive
communicative cues might lead infants to preferentially encode the identity of the referent,
rather than transient properties that will not generalize to other instances (i.e., the referent's
location). Consistent with these predictions, infants look longer when there is a location
change following non-communicative reaching, but look longer when there is an identity
change following communicative pointing. In a related study, Futo and colleagues find that
infants map novel functions onto objects (evidenced in their use of function to individuate
spatiotemporally ambiguous objects) only if the objects' affordances are demonstrated with
the cues described above (Futo, Téglás, Csibra, and Gergely, 2010). These findings suggest
that the information an infant encodes when observing a given object differs depending on
whether the infant has been engaged pedagogically, or is simply observing the intentional
action of another.
Further evidence for pedagogy-specific learning biases in infancy comes from a
study by Topál and colleagues showing that ostensive communicative cues modulate
perseveration in Piaget's A-not-B task (Topál, Gergely, Miklósi, Erdhegyi, and Csibra,
2008). In this classic paradigm, an experimenter repeatedly hides a toy in a location and
allows the child to search for it. After repeatedly retrieving the toy from the first location,
infants continue to search that location even when they witness the experimenter hide the
toy in a new place. While this perseverative error is normally explained in terms of the
cognitive control required to inhibit returning to the previously successful search location,
The origins of pedagogy
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -556-
Topál and colleagues (2008) find that the effect depends heavily on the social-
communicative context of the hiding event. When the experimenter exhibits ostensive cues
while hiding the toy originally, infants make the perseverative error 81% of the time. When
these communicative cues are absent, error rates drop by half. This effect of
communicative context is interpreted as evidence that infants encode the ostensively
signaled hiding event as conveying generic information (i.e., "toys are hidden here"), which
continues to influence search behavior in subsequent trials4
Taken together, these findings suggest that infants encode different information in
pedagogical and non-pedagogical contexts. But are the data described above clear evidence
that infants represent the communicative intentions behind pedagogical overtures, and that
their learning depends on specific assumptions about the nature of the information
intentionally provided by others? Furthermore, the NP hypothesis asserts that humans learn
from pedagogy via an adaptation that is unique to our species, a claim that obviously
cannot be resolved with evidence from human infants alone. Experiments with nonhuman
animals are necessary to assess whether forms of social learning present in early infancy
are indeed fundamentally different from those observed in other species. In the following
sections, we expand upon these developmental data and consider possible interpretations in
light of findings with nonhuman animals. We begin by reviewing empirical phenomena
from nonhuman animals, and discussing evolutionary theory relevant to teaching.
.
Evidence for Teaching in Nonhuman Animals
In evolutionary biology and behavioral ecology, there has been a long-standing
interest in the forms of social transmission present across taxa. Recent research with several
wild and captive animal populations has revealed behaviors that meet Caro and Hauser's
(1992) functional definition, suggesting that teaching is a key form of social learning in
some nonhuman systems. One example of teaching in a nonhuman species is the
transmission of prey-handling skills in wild meerkats (Thornton and McAuliffe, 2006).
Meerkat pups must learn to handle a range of mobile and potentially dangerous prey, and
adult meerkats facilitate this learning process by bringing killed or disabled prey to young
pups, and providing increasingly intact prey as pups mature. Critically, adults engage in
these behaviors only when begging pups are present (criterion 1), and incur no obvious
immediate benefit from provisioning pups in this way (criterion 2). This creates
opportunities for pups to safely practice prey handling, and experimental interventions
confirm that these behaviors facilitate skill acquisition (criterion 3).
The three functional criteria are also met by the case of tandem running in ants
(Temnothorax albipennis). Knowledgeable individuals guide naïve nest-mates to food
sources by running in tandem, slowing their pace as naïve individuals learn the route
4 Similar effects have been found with domesticated dogs (Canis familiaris) (see Topál, Gergely, Erdhöhegyi,
Csibra, and Miklósi, 2009), however only in human infants is the effect robust to change in the identity of the
experimenter. This is taken as evidence that humans, but not dogs, interpret the communicative act as
providing generic information that holds irrespective of the individuals involved.
The origins of pedagogy

(Franks and Richardson, 2006; Richardson, Sleeman, McNamara, Houston, and Franks,
2007). The leader modifies its behavior based on feedback from the follower, taking longer
to obtain food than it would in the absence of a follower, and the naïve individual locates
the food source more quickly than without a leader. Furthermore, the follower takes a more
efficient path home, suggesting that tandem running not only facilitates the outbound
journey, but results in learning the location of the food source with respect to the nest.
Other examples include the teaching of food calls in pied-babblers (Raihani and Ridley,
2008), and putative evidence in several other taxa (elephants [Loxodonta africana], Bates et
al., 2010; tamarins [Saguinus oedipus], Humle and Snowdon, 2008; see Byrne and
Rapaport, 2011).
Importantly, these examples are classified as teaching according to a functional
definition that makes no assumptions about the intentions or internal representations of the
teacher or learner (Caro and Hauser, 1992). Operationalizing teaching in a mechanism-
independent way has led to skepticism about the relevance of animal findings to an
understanding of human teaching (Csibra, 2007). The value of a strict, outcome-based
definition of teaching has been a topic of recent debate (Byrne and Rappaport, 2011;
Rapaport and Byrne, 2012; see response from Thornton and McAuliffe, 2012. Here, we
simply assume that the utility of a particular operationalization depends on what exactly is
at stake in the research (for example, do we want to identify an animal model for human
teaching, or to understand how social learning problems are solved in diverse neural
architectures?). Because these research goals vary across disciplines and individual studies,
and are only occasionally made explicit, we begin our discussion of how developmental
and comparative approaches may benefit one another by reviewing a few central
motivations of evolutionary biologists and comparative psychologists studying teaching.
Why Study Teaching in Animals?
One motivation for investigating teaching across non-human taxa is to uncover the
selection pressures that lead to the evolution of different forms of social transmission, and
the ecological or life-history conditions under which different behaviors manifest (Fogarty,
Strimling, and Laland, 2011; Laland, Odling-Smee, and Gilbert, 2008; Leadbetter and
Chittka, 2007; Thornton and Clutton-Brock, 2011; Thornton and Raihani, 2008). From an
evolutionary dynamics perspective, active teaching presents several puzzles (Dawkins and
Krebs, 1978). Although mechanisms for learning from others would serve a clear adaptive
function, the advantage of mechanisms for actively transmitting knowledge to others are
less obvious. Active teaching constitutes a form of cooperation (Hoppitt et al., 2008;
Thornton and Raihani, 2008) and is therefore of interest to researchers exploring how
seemingly altruistic behaviors can be evolutionarily stable strategies (Hamilton, 1964;
Nowak, 2006; Trivers, 1971). Teaching might, for example, be more likely in eusocial or
cooperatively breeding societies, due to kin selection (Burkhart, Hrdy, and van Schaik,
2009; Rapaport, 2006), which could partially explain the taxonomic distribution of
documented teaching behaviors.
To characterize the evolution of teaching, we also need an account of the
informational content that tends to require active transmission from a knowledgeable
The origins of pedagogy
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -558-
individual in the first place (see Fogarty et al., 2011 for a more comprehensive discussion).
Each of the documented animal examples involves teaching of a distinct type of
information: procedural skills in the case of meerkat prey-handling, a location in the case of
tandem running ants, and a general association in the case of pied-babblers (for discussion
of different forms of teaching, see Caro and Hauser, 1992). In the case of humans, Csibra
and Gergely (2009, 2011) have argued for the role of active communication in transmitting
functional or means-end information (relevant to exploiting and manufacturing causally
opaque cultural artifacts like tools), and in spreading conventional knowledge systems
(rituals, religions, food practices, languages, etc.). They argue that it was specifically the
technological complexity of hominin artifact cultures that created selection pressure for
rapid and robust transmission mechanisms. Similarly, Tomasello and colleagues have
argued that intentional teaching is a key means by which our species sustains cumulative
culture and cultural ratcheting (Tomasello, 1999; see also Dean, Kendal, Schapiro, Thierry,
and Laland, 2012). However, studies with nonhuman animals suggest that the presence of
causally opaque cultural products like tools and social conventions is not necessary for the
evolution of all forms of teaching.
While work in evolutionary biology has traditionally been concerned with ultimate
rather than proximate levels of analysis (Tinbergen, 1963), understanding the cognitive
processes that underlie behavioral phenomena will be crucial to understanding their
phylogenetic origins (Chittka, Rossiter, Skorupski, and Fernando, in 2012; MacLean et al.,
2011). A key question for understanding the evolution of cognition concerns the specificity
with which natural selection adapts systems to their environment (for a range of views, see
Cosmides and Tooby, 1987; Heyes, 2012c; Hirschfield and Gelman, 1994). When does
natural selection favor specific adaptations to a particular set of information-processing
demands, and under what conditions are general-purpose resources exploited? In defense of
a strongly domain-general view, Heyes has recruited comparative and neuroscientific
evidence that social learning covaries with nonsocial learning across taxa, can be observed
even in asocial species, and exhibits many of the key signatures of associative processes
known to operate across disparate domains (Heyes, 2012b,d; see also Behrens, Hunt,
Woolrich, and Rushworth, 2008). On the other hand, in meerkats and tandem-running ants,
teaching presumably relies on mechanisms precisely catered to very specific learning
problems of prey-handling and food localization in each species (Franks and Richardson,
2006; Thornton and McAulliffe, 2006). While it is unknown whether these mechanisms
could, under the right environmental pressures, be co-opted to meet other transmission
needs, the rigidity of these teaching phenomena (see below) suggests content-specific
adaptations that are limited in scope. Identifying the conditions under which a more flexible
multi-purpose teaching mechanism might evolve remains an important project for
evolutionary biologists (see proposal in Csibra and Gergely, 2011).
Teaching also presents an interesting case for understanding the range of cognitive
processes than could meet a particular functional demand, and the diversity of
neuroarchitectures that would support these processes (Chittka et al., in press; Leadbetter
and Chittka, 2007). In general, a contribution of comparative psychology can be to test
hypotheses about which psychological mechanisms are necessary to support a behavior of
interest (see, for example, Mendes, Rakoczy, and Call, 2008; Phillips and Santos, 2007 on
The origins of pedagogy
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -559-
the necessity of linguistic representations for kind-based object individuation). Based on
the forms of teaching evident in humans, it has been suggested that effective teaching
involves abstract inferential abilities, including representations of the knowledge and
beliefs of the learner (Premack and Premack, 1996; Tomasello, 1999). Others focus on
morphological prerequisites, suggesting that forms of social learning might be uniquely
supported by the expanded primate neocortex (Humphrey, 1976; Reader and Laland, 2002).
Evidence of teaching in insect and avian systems creates demand for more nuanced
articulations of such claims. Because it is not always clear what sort of representations are
prerequisites for a given behavior (see, for example, Cruse and Wehner, 2011), identifying
manifestations of an ability across taxa can reveal the diversity of solutions to a basic
functional or computational problem. Furthermore, when convergent evolution leads to
analogous cognitive mechanisms across taxa, it may be useful to characterize how these are
implemented in distinct neuroarchitectures (Emery and Clayton, 2004)5
Indeed, cases of teaching in nonhuman animals speak to the diversity of solutions to
this class of learning problem. Consider, for example, the meerkat's ability to provide skill-
appropriate prey in response to begging calls (Thornton and McAullife, 2006). A key
question is whether meerkats possess an abstract representation of the pup's skill level, for
which begging calls are just one reliable cue, or whether they respond to begging calls
directly, without an intermediate inference about skill level. Empirical evidence falls in
favor of the latter interpretation. When presented playbacks of begging calls from pups
differing in age from those actually in the group, helpers provision based on the age to
which recorded calls corresponded, failing to use other relevant information to provision
the pups appropriately (for example, knowledge that the pup successfully handled intact
prey previously). Such research characterizing how, in the abstract, an organism could
solve a problem (along with an account the actual algorithms a neural system could
implement to do so) will be crucial to understanding the evolution of functionally defined
abilities like teaching (see Chittka et al., 2012; Thornton and Lukas, 2012).
.
Research on teaching can also shed light on the range of proximate mechanisms that
have evolved to sustain cooperative strategies more broadly. Do prosocial or other-
regarding motivations play a necessary role in teaching? Some claim that an intrinsic
motivation to share information and mental states drives teaching in humans (Tomasello,
Carpenter, Call, Behne, and Moll, 2005, Byrne and Rappaport, 2011) and perhaps other
cooperatively breeding species (Burkhart and van Schaik, 2010). It is quite likely, however,
that active information transfer occurs in the absence of empathic motivations (see relevant
discussion in Vasconcelos, Hollis, Nowbahari, and Kacelnik, 2012). There is currently little
data to speak to this question; whether any nonhuman species share information with a
5 Of course, for certain purposes, homology is essential. The areas of human cognition that have been most
fruitfully and rigorously characterized (i.e., the visual system) have clearly benefited from the
neurophysiological methods afforded by the primate model (van Essen, Anderson, and Felleman, 1992). For
this purpose, establishing common mechanisms is highly relevant, as the insights from the animal model to

empirical research.
Human Pedagogy: Insights from Nonhuman Animals
Having laid out some key aims of research on the evolution of teaching, and some
existing empirical findings with nonhuman animals, we now ask whether this body of work
can constrain or inform the study of pedagogy in human learners. What can developmental
psychologists learn from the study of teaching in other taxa? In interpreting experiments
with human infants, the comparative perspective may be especially useful. As mentioned
above, comparative evidence has been used to argue that many forms of social learning
may depend on domain-general associative processes (Heyes, 2012b,d) rather than
mechanisms evolved for the purpose of social transmission. This question remains
unanswered with respect to our species' receptivity to pedagogy: Do humans have an
innate adaptation for learning from teachers, triggered by a set of communicative signals
for which evolution has prepared us? Or do humans rely on powerful domain-general
learning mechanisms that enable them to quickly learn about human communication,
recruiting previous teaching experiences to interpret subsequent communicative acts?
In considering the mechanisms supporting social learning across species, Heyes
(2012b) emphasizes the distinction between perceptual mechanisms and learning or
inference processes themselves, pointing out that general-purpose learning mechanisms can
rely on input analyzers specialized for social information. That is, a species might have
attentional or perceptual mechanisms (e.g., gaze-detectors) that facilitate the detection and
exploitation of social information, while the subsequent processing of that information
(e.g., categorization, inference, storage in long term memory) might depend on fully
domain-general resources. However, on Heyes' view, even the input mechanisms
themselves can be developed in a domain-general fashion, via experience with social
stimuli reliably signaling fitness-relevant resources (see for example, Leadbetter and
Chittka, 2007; Raihani and Ridley, 2008). As with other species, these questions remain
wide-open with respect to human learning, and domain-general alternatives should be
considered in parallel to the intriguing proposal put forth by Csibra and Gergely (2009).
Whereas Heyes (2012b) endorses a view in which social learning phenomena
depend on resources that are both domain-general and representationally impoverished
(i.e., associative mechanisms), it is also possible that organisms "learn to learn" socially via
domain-general mechanisms that operate over abstract, structured representations (see
Kemp, Perfors, and Tenenbaum, 2007). Another possibility is that input analyzers specific
to ostensive communication might interact with mechanisms that are specific to the social
domain, but broader in scope than the learning mechanisms assumed in the NP hypothesis
(e.g., innate systems for representing goal-directed actions: Wood, Glynn, Phillips, and
Hauser, 2007; social relationships: Seyfarth and Cheney, 2003). On the latter view, unique
and powerful forms of social learning could emerge as newly evolved perceptual
sensitivities combine in piece-meal fashion with phylogenetically older social-cognitive
machinery.
Beyond the issues of domain-specificity and innateness, the presence of effective

teaching in nonhuman animals highlights the question of whether the representations
supporting receptivity to pedagogy in human infants need be as rich as those posited by the
NP hypothesis. While the studies reviewed above suggest infants are attuned to
communicative signals of others, and that ostensive-communicative cues facilitate generic
knowledge acquisition, it is not clear that these phenomena reflect the sophisticated
inferences that have been modeled and empirically demonstrated in older children. In the
animal literature, there is considerable evidence that complex, adaptive behaviors can be
supported by relatively lean mechanisms (Leadbetter and Chittka, 2007), and specifically
that instances of effective teaching can depend on fairly simple stimulus-response
mappings (Thornton and McAuliffe, 2012). For example, in the case of a meerkat adult
modifying prey to match a pup's skill level, playback experiments indicate that the link
between begging calls and prey modification is rigid and direct, likely relying on a
mechanism that transmits very particular species-relevant information without high-level
inferential abilities on the part of the teacher or recipient. With humans, as with other
animals, we must distinguish between social-gating mechanisms (Kuhl, 2007) that might
function to transmit generic knowledge from teacher to learner in pedagogical contexts, and
mechanisms that do so by actually representing communicative intent and assumptions
about the nature of the information provided.
The developmental experiments reviewed above appear to be open to multiple
interpretations. The finding by Topal and colleagues (2009), for example, could be
explained in terms of an attentional mechanism that leads to a stronger, more robust
representation of the initial hiding event under pedagogical conditions. In the absence of
pedagogical cues, working memory representations might be transient and weak, such that
prior locations do not compete, and infants successfully search in the current location.
When accompanied by pedagogical cues, both location representations are maintained,
creating competition and a need to inhibit return to the prior location. Thus, the effect of
social context might not depend on any sort of inference about the relevance or genericity
of the initial hiding location, but simply a change in the strength of the location
representation at the time of encoding.
As for Yoon and colleagues' (2008) finding that infants selectively encode kind-
relevant information in a communicative context, it is possible that infants actually have a
general tendency to encode and detect changes in the salient surface features of an object
(evidence that features are not used for numerical individuation does not directly bear on
this issue). On the other hand, the object's location becomes a highly relevant property
when the target of a goal-directed reaching action. Thus, it is possible that detection of
surface features in the communicative context reflects a baseline encoding of this featural
information, with the detection of location information in a reaching context being an effect
of the reaching cue specifically. Both interpretations are plausible, and a baseline condition
is needed to distinguish between these possibilities6
Further experiments might seek to dissociate ostensive cues themselves from the

inference that the cues are supposed to license. What sort of information can infants exploit
when evaluating the relevance of a given communicative event? As reviewed above,
preschool-aged children distinguish between a communicative act that is successfully
completed and an act that is interrupted (Bonawitz et al., 2011). Similarly, Bonawitz and
colleagues find that children can learn from pedagogical overtures directed at a third-party
who shares similar knowledge to the self (a child, in comparison to an adult), suggesting
that direct eye-contact and contingency are not essential, but that children can flexibly
evaluate the relevance of the information provided. Can infants identify the intention to
teach in a similarly flexible, rational manner, even when the prototypical cues are lacking
or misleading? Younger children (18-months) learn from third-party social interactions
even when the target is an adult (Meltzoff and Brooks, 2008), so it remains to be seen
whether toddlers could exploit other cues to the self-relevance of the information provided.
Similarly, infants might discount ostensive cues if provided with evidence that these cues
do not signal self-relevant information, for example, if given evidence that the
communicative act was actually intended for a person with a different knowledge state than
the infant. Such flexibility would provide stronger evidence for the view that infants
represent the information as intended for them, and make inferences on this basis7
These experiments are designed to test the most extreme view, that infants form
highly abstract representations of communicative intent, integrating a range of superficially
disparate pieces of evidence to infer that pedagogical assumptions hold. However, a
number of intermediate possibilities exist, and experiments exploring the scope and
flexibility of these abilities will be essential. Here, we do not argue for any particular
interpretation of the existing data, but simply wish to note the range of alternatives that are
currently open. The animal literature attests to the power of natural selection to shape
functional transmission behaviors without abstract inferential mechanisms (Leadbetter and
Chittka, 2007, Thornton and McAuliffe, 2012), and the developmental community would
do well to consider leaner mechanisms that could support human social learning as well
.

The Evolution of Teaching: Insights from Human Development
.
Thus far, we have argued that the study of human pedagogy would benefit from the
empirical phenomena and theoretical insights of recent work with nonhuman animals. But
the evolutionary biologists among us hope that information can flow in the opposite
direction as well. We now consider potential contributions of developmental psychology to
7 Of course, a domain-specific learning mechanism of the kind proposed by Csibra and Gergely (2009) need
not integrate all relevant information. Indeed, a key characteristic of domain-specific systems is their
automaticity, and their reliance on a restricted set of inputs (Fodor, 1983). The question is whether infants'
learning depends on a representation of communicative intent, as opposed to a more direct mapping between
communicative cues and certain encoding strategies. Flexible integration of multiple cues to communicative
relevance is just one way to argue for the former.

understanding the evolution of teaching and the mechanisms supporting teaching across
taxa. First, although the distinctive feature of teaching is that the knowledgeable individual
plays an active role in transmission, developmental studies highlight the fact that the term
"active" is equally relevant for the learner. A complete account of teaching will involve
characterizing the processes involved in instructing others and those involved in
capitalizing on instruction received. Recent developmental and computational modeling
work has emphasized the cues by which humans identify teaching contexts (Csibra and
Gergely, 2006), and how the inferences they make in these contexts depend upon
assumptions about the nature of information provided (Shafto and Goodman, 2008). These
are potentially fruitful areas for future research with nonhuman animals.
Above, we reviewed evidence that human infants may be specifically attuned to
behaviors that accompany communicative or pedagogical acts by adults. Do other species
exhibit behavioral signatures that signal a mode of active information transfer, and if so, do
naïve individuals exploit these cues to identify opportunities for learning? If teaching
evolved in response to the substantial costs or dangers associated with individual
exploration, selection may have favored rapid identification of contexts in which these
dangers are ameliorated. Given that ostensive cues appear to have co-evolved with
corresponding attentional biases in humans, it seems plausible that similar coordination
would exist in other species. The meerkat pup, for example, would do well to identify prey
that have been selected for them specifically (and thus are likely to be in a state manageable
for their skill level) and to avoid unmodified prey, or prey modified for a more experienced
pup. Consistent with this, Thornton and McAuliffe (2006) find that pups are more likely to
interact with prey provisioned by a conspecific helper than identical prey provisioned by an
experimenter, without a helper nearby.
It is possible that meerkats actually represent the fact that prey provisioned by
conspecifics tend to be manageable for their skill level, and engage in otherwise risky
exploratory behaviors because the teaching context suggests it is safe to do so. However, it
is also possible that pups simply avoid food provided by a foreign individual.
Manipulations analogous to those used by Bonawitz and colleagues (2011) might help to
distinguish these possibilities. For example, Bonawitz found that children treat a
pedagogical demonstration differently if the demonstration is interrupted. Are meerkats
similarly sensitive to whether the provisioner was interrupted while disabling the prey?
Children also selectively learn from teaching directed at a third party when the information
is likely to be relevant to the self (i.e., when the demonstration is directed towards another
child, but not when directed towards an adult). Could an experiment be designed to test
whether meerkats also prefer to handle prey modified for a comparably skilled pup
compared to prey modified for a more experienced individual?
Similar experiments could be designed with tandem running ants. Would ants
explore less when taught the location of food (compared to a social foraging situation that
did not involve teaching), analogous to the way human children engage in restricted
exploration following what they assume to be a complete and representative demonstration
(Bonawitz et al., 2011)? Restricted exploratory behavior seems to be a key signature of
teaching in humans, and one that is intimately related to its primary function of restricting
the learner's hypothesis space to support rapid learning (Bonawitz et al., 2011). Might this
The origins of pedagogy
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -564-
be a recurring phenomenon across taxa? Suppose an ant encounters a suboptimal food
source either by following a tandem guide or by simply arriving at the source at the same
time as another individual--would ants that discovered the food themselves be more likely
to forgo low quality food and continue foraging, compared to those guided to this food
patch? And if so, could experiments be designed to distinguish the effects of teaching from
more general social influences on foraging? While Franks and colleagues have
characterized some of the flexibility in ants' tandem running behavior (Franklin et al.,
2011; Richardson et al., 2007), it is currently unknown whether ants would be sensitive to
the various nuanced distinctions that modulate learning in human children. Probing the
flexibility and sophistication of teaching across taxa will be crucial to understanding the
evolution of different forms of social transmission, and the mechanisms supporting
teaching in other species.
Recall also Gweon's studies in which children expect complete and representative
information from teachers, and negatively evaluate others for omitting relevant information
in third party interactions (Gweon et al., 2011). As discussed above, evolutionary theorists
have often conceptualized teaching as a form of cooperation (Burkart and van Schaik,
2010; Thornton and Raihani, 2008). It appears that, in humans, the cooperative nature of
teaching is actually represented by the recipient, and the expectation of helpful,
representative information is part of what enables efficient transmission of knowledge in
pedagogical contexts. Do other species anticipate the informational benefits of teaching
interactions, and represent the interaction as a cooperative one? These questions may be
crucial to understanding the evolution of teaching, as the learner's assumptions about the
helpfulness of a teacher can make teaching a uniquely efficient mode of social transmission
(Shafto et al., 2012).
Another key claim from the developmental literature is that teaching evolved to
facilitate the transmission of cultural knowledge, and that children are specifically adapted
to learn generic, conventional information from others (Cisbra and Gergely, 2011). Under
this view, humans expect that the information provided during ostensive communication
will not pertain only to the immediate present, but will generalize across people and time.
Given that this generalizability is argued to be uniquely human, is there any evidence that
nonhuman animals are biased to learn generic information from others? Meerkat pups
clearly learn procedural knowledge that they generalize to future encounters with prey
items, and it is possible that animals learn regularities that enable generalization beyond the
particular teaching instances. For example, the ant could learn across tandem running
instances that food sources tend to be located near certain environmental features, and this
association could then facilitate future foraging.
However, these examples involve multiple instances of teaching, and the NP
hypothesis is primarily concerned with the ability to generalize in the absence of exposure
to regularities that would otherwise be necessary to warrant such inferences (Cisbra and
Gergely, 2011). It is proposed that human learners can generalize from a single teaching
instance (e.g., if taught a new fact about a dog, assume it to be true of all dogs, rather than
idiosyncratic to the particular referent) based on an assumption that teachers provide
generic, representative information (Csibra and Gergely, 2011). Bonawitz and colleagues
(2011) provide evidence that preschool children do possess inductive constraints powerful
The origins of pedagogy
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -565-
enough to support rapid learning under pedagogical conditions (see also Futo et al., 2010;
Gelman et al., 2012; Shafto et al., 2010). Future research with nonhuman animals might
explore whether teaching in nonhuman animals ever supports this rapid sort of learning.
Adapting the computational approaches that have been used to formalize learning and
inference in children will be useful for assessing whether animal learning is best fit by
models that assume pedagogical sampling, or those containing a weaker set of assumptions
(see Shafto et al., 2012).
Relationship to Cognitive Architecture
While this review has focused primarily on questions regarding the origins of the
ability to learn from teaching, the theories discussed herein can be associated with distinct
claims about the underlying architecture as well. For example, if receptivity to pedagogy is
constructed via domain-general learning mechanisms that detect regularities in the
communicative interactions experienced over development, one might expect that the
acquired knowledge will be represented and exploited using general-purpose cognitive
machinery. Across domains, we interpret observations in light of our prior knowledge of
the domain (e.g., interpret water droplets as rain rather than a sprinkler when the sky is
gray, due to our intuitive knowledge of weather). One possibility is that the neural
machinery that represents and exploits regularities in pedagogical communication to
interpret subsequent communicative acts is highly general (it might operate across domains
as diverse as weather prediction and pedagogical communication, or it might rely on
mechanisms that are specific to social or mental state information [e.g., Saxe and
Kanwisher, 2003], but not to pedagogical communication specifically). This perspective
might also predict that these representations will be flexible, such that reliable
communicative tendencies can be learned and unlearned based purely on the learners'
experiences in relevant communicative contexts.
Nativist accounts, on the other hand, tend to be associated with claims of domain-
specific systems operating with some rigidity throughout the lifespan (Spelke, 2003).
Under this view, the abilities that emerge early in development are the result of functionally
specialized neural circuits that were shaped by natural selection to solve evolutionarily
relevant problems in efficient, content-specific ways. Thus, in the case of pedagogy, an
innate adaptation might involve a dedicated neural mechanism for receiving
communicative instruction from teachers. A strong version of this view might also predict
that learners would respond to a fixed set of inputs (those that were communicatively
relevant in the environment in which the system evolved), and do so in a relatively
automatic, inflexible way. Rather than taking into account any and all relevant information
to interpret diverse communicative acts, the cues exploited in pedagogical contexts might
be limited and relatively indefeasible.
Do findings from developmental and evolutionary disciplines bear directly on these
questions regarding the specificity of the neural architecture, and the flexibility of its
operation? Many theorists have assumed that there will be reliable relationships between
the origins of particular abilities (built from rich innate structure or from domain-general
learning mechanisms), the neural localization of these abilities (specialized neural circuits,
The origins of pedagogy
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(3). 2013. -566-
or recruitment of non-specific neural resources), and the signatures that characterize the
relevant processing (fast, automatic, and constrained, or controlled, defeasible, and
flexible) (Fodor, 1983). While this is an intriguing possibility, the relationship between
these dimensions may not be so straightforward; learning can yield localized neural
modules (e.g., VWFA in humans: see relevant discussion in Kanwisher, 2010), and innate
content could, in principle, be represented and recruited for inferences in a way that is
common across domains. Thus, we argue that future empirical and conceptual work is
needed to clarify the relationship between these dimensions, and to establish the relevance
of evolutionary and developmental data to claims regarding the underlying cognitive
architecture.
Conclusions
The last decade has seen heightened interest in the development and evolution of
teaching. However, extant dialogue between disciplines has generally expressed skepticism
about the extent to which comparative data contributes to the study of human teaching
(Byrne and Rapaport, 2011; Csibra, 2007). We welcome these concerns, and attribute them
to ambiguity in the aims and assumptions underlying much current work in comparative
psychology (see Boesch, 2007; Thornton and Lukas, 2012). It is increasingly common for
researchers to compare performance of children and other animals, yet it is not always clear
what is to be gained from these comparisons. In this review, we aimed to expand upon
these critical analyses of the relationship between human and nonhuman teaching.
Although the correspondence between teaching in humans and nonhuman animals is
limited, we find the comparative approach to nonetheless be useful. Findings from these
different disciplines can be mutually informative so long as researchers are explicit about
what is assumed and at stake in the comparisons.
It is important to note that in arguing for an evolutionary perspective on human
teaching, we are not endorsing a narrowly adaptationist approach. Rather we aim to
delineate the numerous ways in which our evolved cognitive architecture might support
active forms of social learning. We find it premature to favor one or another alternative
based on the evidence available at this stage, but aimed to identify key distinctions and
open questions, and suggest ways of distinguishing between these viable alternatives.
Characterizing the evolution of the human mind will involve integrating theories and
findings from evolutionary biology, comparative and developmental psychology, cognitive
neuroscience, and computational modeling to understand how natural selection shapes
neural systems to solve fitness-relevant problems in their environment.
We propose that continued research on teaching across phylogeny and ontogeny
will be crucial to understanding the diverse forms social learning can take, and the possible
mechanisms that can support effective transmission of different types of information. With
respect to humans, it may be crucial to understanding our species-specific ability to
maintain a rich, cumulative cultural inheritance (Fogarty et al., 2011; Tomasello, 1999).
Humans inhabit dynamic, complex, and richly diverse environments, constructing
intellectual, political, and cultural institutions that massively outstrip the achievements of
even closely related species, and exhibit ratcheting over time. A central problem for
The origins of pedagogy

evolutionary and developmental researchers is to characterize the key cognitive ingredients
that drive these vast, undeniable differences (Heyes, 2012d; Tomasello et al., 2005). The
study of teaching, along with other forms of social transmission, has the potential to yield
progress on this question by characterizing how changes occurring over phylogenetic
timescales support forms of learning that widen this gulf over ontogeny.
