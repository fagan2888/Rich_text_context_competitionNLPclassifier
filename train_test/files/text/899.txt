Using data from the second wave of the National Survey of Families and Households, the
authors examine the determinants of frequent and infrequent visiting between grand-
parents and their grandchild sets. A grandchild set consists of all the children of
a particular child of the grandparent, provided that the grandchildren reside in
their parent's household. The 6 significant predictors of frequent or infrequent
contact are geographic distance, quality of relationship between grandparent and
parent of the grandchild set, number of grandchild sets, gender of grandparent,
lineage of the grandchild set, and marital status of the grandparent.

Frequency of Grandparent Contact
With Grandchild Sets: Six Factors
That Make a Difference
Peter Uhlenberg, PhD,1 and Bradley G. Hammill:
The potential for grandparents to have frequent,
face-to-face contact with their young grandchildren
is probably greater today than at any previous time
in history (Uhlenberg & Kirby, in press). Moreover,
national studies of intergenerational relationships
repeatedly find that most grandparents do have fre-
quent contact with at least some of their grand-
children (Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986; Gravenish &
Thomson, 1996; Harris & Associates, 1975). Never-
theless, these studies also reveal substantial varia-
bility among grandparents in level of involvement
with their grandchildren. At the extremes, some see
grandchildren daily whereas others have no contact.
This article uses data from a large, national survey to
examine several critical variables predicting whether
grandparents have either frequent or infrequent con-
tact with various sets of their grandchildren.
A new study is not needed to establish that geo-
graphic distance is a strong predictor of frequency of
intergenerational contact. Every study that includes
a measure of distance finds that the closer grandpar-
ents live to grandchildren, the more likely they are to
visit frequently (Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986; Hodgson,
1992; Whitbeck, Hoyt & Huck, 1993). Further, these
same studies have established that the quality of the
relationship between grandparents and their chil-
dren (G1-G2) is related to the frequency of contact
between grandparents and their grandchildren (GI-
GS). Past research has not, however, provided clear
and/or consistent findings regarding the role of a

number of other potentially interesting variables. The
lack of clear findings is because most studies are based
on small and/or nonrepresentative samples (Aldous,
1995; Robertson, 1995). Using a nationally represen-
tative sample of more than 4,600 grandparent-grand-
child set dyads, we are able to more carefully assess
the impact of factors that potentially make a differ-
ence in frequency of contact.
Background
On the basis of previous theoretical and empirical
studies of intergenerational relationships, there are a
number of variables that might be expected to influ-
ence the frequency of contact between grandparents
and grandchildren. We will group these variables in
several categories: opportunity variables; gender/family
variables; and sociodemographic variables.
Opportunity Variables.--Geographic distance is
the most obvious factor influencing opportunity for fre-
quency contact. Both the time and expense of main-
taining frequent face-to-face contact increase as dis-
tance between grandparents and grandchildren
increases. As already noted, studies routinely find dis-
tance to be by far the strongest of all predictors of
contact.
A second variable affecting opportunity for fre-
quent interaction is the number of grandchildren an
older person has. Given that time and resources are
limited, one might expect that as the number of
grandchildren increases, the opportunity for grand-
parents to have frequent contact with any particular
grandchild would decrease. Although this is a plausible
hypothesis, little empirical attention has been given
to the effects of number of grandchildren. In this study,
276 The Gerontologist
we focus not on individual grandchildren but on
grandchild sets. A grandchild set is defined as the
group of children (G3) living in the household of a
grandparent's (G1) child (C2). Thus, the number of
grandchild sets will vary depending on how many
children (C2) with children (G3) in their households a
grandparent has. Each grandparent-grandchild set
dyad is examined separately, and the effect of num-
ber of grandchild sets on frequency of visiting with a
particular grandchild set is determined. This focus on
grandchild sets provides a useful approach to study-
ing involvement of grandparents with their grand-
children, although it cannot be used to explore some
interesting facets of the relationship. For example,
using this approach, the role of such individual grand-
child characteristics as age and gender cannot be
examined directly.
Two additional variables may affect opportunity
for frequent contact, although previous research has
not found them to be significant (Cherlin & Fursten-
berg, 1986). Grandparents' health status could plau-
sibly be a factor if poor health limits mobility. How-
ever, because the most impaired grandparents, those
living in nursing homes, are excluded from our sample,
this is not expected to be an important variable. The
other variable, labor force status of the grandparent,
also could have an effect on frequency of contact,
assuming that those in the labor force have less time
available for visiting.
Gender/Family Variables.--No discussion of grand-
parenthood in America should omit consideration
of the role of gender. The importance of gender in
kinship relationships was stressed by Alice Rossi
when she wrote, "As childrearers, caregivers, and kin
keepers, women provide the glue that holds family
and lineages together" (1995, p. 275).
Hagestad (1986) made a similar point when she
discussed the kin-keeping role of women and the in-
creasing "female axis" of intergenerational rela-
tionships. In considering how gender might affect
frequency of contact between grandparents and sets
of grandchildren, both the grandparents' sex and the
lineage of the grandchildren may be important.
Given the kin-keeping role of grandmothers, we ex-
pect they will have more frequent contact with
grandchildren than do grandfathers. And if the female
axis of intergenerational linkages is most important,
we would expect greater contact between maternal
grandparents and grandchildren than between pater-
nal ones. Several studies have supported this hypoth-
esis (Gravenish & Thomson, 1996; Roberto & Stroes,
1992; Rossi & Rossi, 1990). It is surprising, however,
that several other studies report that frequency of
contact was not associated with gender of the grand-
parent and that there was no significant difference
between maternal and paternal grandparents (Cherlin
& Furstenberg, 1986; Hodgson, 1992).
It is expected that marital status will be a significant
predictor of frequency of contact with grandchildren
for grandfathers. It is clear that divorced older men
have far less contact with their adult children than
married ones (Cooney & Uhlenberg, 1990). Further,
widowed grandfathers may have less contact with
their grandchildren than married ones because they
lack a wife to facilitate the maintenance of close kin-
ship ties. Marital status of grandmothers also may
be significant in some cases, either because lack of a
spouse may weaken ties to children or reduce re-
sources needed for traveling to a child's house. We
anticipate, however, that marital status will have
greater consequences for contact with grandchildren
among men than women.
One additional aspect of kinship relationships is
considered in this study: the quality of the relation-
ship between the parent and the grandparent of
the grandchild set. The middle generation has been
characterized as the "bridge" or "gatekeeper" for
the G1-G3 relationship, with the ability to facilitate
or impede the frequency of interactions. When par-
ents have an emotionally close relationship with the
grandparents it is reasonable to expect that the
grandparents will see that set of grandchildren more
frequently than when the parent-grandparent rela-
tionship is strained. Several studies, in addition to
those cited above, provide support for the hypothesis
that positive affect between the first and second gen-
erations promotes closeness and contact between
the first and third generations (Johnson, 1985; King &
Wider, 1995; Matthews & Sprey, 1985).
Sociodemographic Variables.--Several standard
control variables are included in the cluster of socio-
demographic factors, although no firm hypotheses
regarding their effects are suggested by previous re-
search. The three variables included in this cluster are
grandparents' age, race, and education. Although age
is not expected to have much effect, it is possible
that older grandparents will tend to have less stamina
than younger ones (even after controlling for health
status), and hence will be less likely to visit frequently
with their children and grandchildren. Possible racial
differences in kinship ties have been of interest to
researchers, and it is clear that African American
grandparents are more likely than Whites to function
as surrogate parents (Hernandez, 1993; Szinovacz,
1998). Among grandparents who do not coreside
with grandchildren, however there is little empirical
evidence suggesting that African Americans are
more likely to have frequent contact with grandchil-
dren (Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986). Finally, possible
effects of educational attainment are examined. Some
suggest that with increasing education there is a
tendency for individuals to rely less on kin for social
relationships (Fischer, 1982). On the other hand,
higher socioeconomic status may be associated with
more resources, which could facilitate more frequent
visiting.
On the basis of results of previous empirical studies
and/or theoretical discussions of kinship and gender,
we expect to find a number of significant predictors
of frequent or infrequent contact between grandpar-
ents and their sets of grandchildren:
1. Geographic proximity is expected to be a strong
predictor of frequency of face-to-face contact.
Vol. 38, No. 3,1998 277
2. Number of grandchild sets is expected to be
negatively associated with frequent contact.
3. Grandmothers are expected to have more fre-
quent contact than grandfathers with grandchild sets.
4. Maternal grandparents are expected to have
more frequent contact than paternal grandparents. Fur-
ther, the effect of lineage is expected to be greater
for grandmothers than grandfathers, given the saliency
of the mother-daughter link.
5. Higher emotional affect between grandparents
and their children is expected to be a predictor of
more frequent contact between grandparents and grand-
children.
6. Married grandparents are expected to have
more frequent contact with grandchildren than wid-
owed or divorced ones. The effect of marital status is
expected to be larger for grandfathers than grand-
mothers.
Data and Methods
The data analyzed in this study are from the sec-
ond wave of the National Survey of Families and
Households (NSFH2). This 1992-93 survey involved
interviews with a national sample of 10,008 adults.
From these adults, we selected all grandparents (G1)
who had at least one child (G2) who had one or more
children (G3) living in his/her household. We are in-
terested not in individual grandchildren, but in each
set of grandchildren that a grandparent has. A set
includes all of the grandchildren living with a particu-
lar adult child of the grandparent. Thus, a grandpar-
ent will have as many sets of grandchildren as she/
he has adult children who have children living at
home. Excluding those who coreside, the NSFH2 con-
tains complete information for 4,629 grandparent-
grandchild set dyads.
The outcome variable of interest in this study is fre-
quency of face-to-face contact between a grand-
parent and a particular set of grandchildren. The
measure of frequency of contact comes from a ques-
tion asking about frequency of contact between the
grandparent and the parent of the grandchild set (who
is the son or daughter of the grandparent). Although
this is not an ideal measure, it provides a reasonable
indicator of how frequently grandparents have con-
tact with a particular set of their grandchildren. Grand-
parents in NSFH2 were asked how frequently they
had contact with grandchildren (on a 6-point scale),
as well as how frequently they had contact with each
child (using the same scale). In most cases where the
grandparent had just one child who had children in
his/her household, the contact reported with grand-
children provides a direct measure of contact with the
grandchild set of the child with children. (This is not
true in all cases, however. See Appendix.) The corre-
lation between reported contact with the child and
with the grandchild set is 0.72, and in 86% of the
cases the reported frequency of contact with the child
and the grandchildren is either identical or in an
adjacent category. (In cases where there is greater
discrepancy, 5% of the grandparents report more
frequent contact with their child; 10% report more
frequent contact with their grandchildren.) For grand-
parents with one set of grandchildren, we compared
multivariate analyses where the dependent variable
(contact with grandchild set) is measured in these two
ways. The results are quite similar (see Appendix).
Two dependent variables are constructed from the
6-point scale of frequency of visiting with the parent
of each grandchild set: 1 = no visiting in the last year,
2 = once a year, 3 = several times a year, 4 = 1 to
3 times a month, 5 = once a week, 6 = more than
once a week. "Frequent" contact is defined as visit-
ing weekly or more often (5 or 6 on the scale); "infre-
quent" contact is defined as visiting once a year or
less (1 or 2 on the scale). The decision to use these
two dependent variables developed after we ran
an ordered logistic regression and found that the
proportional odds assumption was violated, x2 (52,
N = 4608) = 371, p < .001. This indicates that some
independent variables are operating differently at
different levels of the dependent variable. We re-
jected the alternative of using multinomial logistic
regression because results for such an analysis are
inordinately complicated to discuss with a six-level
variable. By creating two variables--one for each
end of the distribution--we are able to discuss results
clearly and simply. Also, by using simple logistic re-
gression we are able to use all of the data, correcting
for family clustering by using Huber standard errors.
As indicated in the preceding section, a number of
relatively straightforward independent variables are
included in this study. Grandparents' age, race (White,
Black, Other), education (years of schooling com-
pleted), work status (in the labor force, not in the
labor force), and health (5-point scale, from "excel-
lent" to "very poor") are included primarily as control
variables, with no strong expectations regarding their
effects. Grandparents' gender (female, male), kin-
ship link to the grandchild set (maternal, paternal),
quality of relationship with the G2 parent (10-point
scale, from "very poor" to "excellent"), and marital
status are critical variables in the family/gender cat-
egory. The four categories of marital status used in
the multivariate analysis are married (meaning mar-
ried to the other parent of the son or daughter who
is parent of the grandchild set), remarried (meaning
current spouse is not the parent of the relevant child),
widowed, and divorce/separated (which also includes
the 37 grandparents who were never married). Dis-
tance is measured in miles between the grandparent
and grandchild set, and log of distance is used in the
regression analysis. Finally, number of grandchild sets
(1, 2, 3, 4+) is included as a predictor variable. In a
preliminary analysis we also included several charac-
teristics of G2 (marital status, labor force participation)
as independent variables. Because none of these was
a significant predictor, and to keep the focus on
grandparents, we dropped these variables in subse-
quent analysis. The distribution of the sample by the
various independent variables is shown in Table 1.
We examine logistic regression equations for two
different dichotomous outcome variables: frequent
versus not-frequent contact and infrequent versus
not-infrequent contact. We initially ran these regres-

sions on the entire sample (including both grandmothers
and grandfathers). However, a likelihood ratio test be-
tween the original model and a fully interactive model
by grandparents' sex confirmed our expectation that
the analysis should be done separately by gender. A
similar test by race did not indicate that different
processes were operating for Whites, Blacks, or other
races. Therefore, we present four regression models
predicting frequent contact for grandmothers, fre-
quent contact for grandfathers, infrequent contact
for grandmothers, and infrequent contact for grand-
fathers. Because a number of grandparents are in-
cluded in more than one grandparent-grandchild set
dyad, we correct for family clustering by using Huber
standard errors. With this correction it is possible to
use each eligible dyad in the regression analysis.
Findings
Cross-Tabulation Analysis
Before considering results from a multivariate
analysis, it is useful to note several interesting findings
from simple cross tabulations. First, as expected, the
more sets of grandchildren that a grandparent has,
the less likely the grandparent is to have frequent
contact with any particular set of grandchildren and
the more likely he/she is to have infrequent contact
with any particular set (see Table 1). Several additional
relationships between number of sets and frequency
of contact are shown in Figures 1 and 2. (Note that
the unit of analysis in Figures 1 and 2 is the individual
grandparent, n = 2,723. This differs from Tables 1
and 2 and Figure 3, where the unit of analysis is the
grandparent-grandchild set dyad, n = 4,629.) As the
number of sets increases, the likelihood that a grand-
parent has frequent contact with at least one set goes
up. For example, the proportion reporting frequent
contact with at least one set of grandchildren in-
creases from 50% of grandparents with one set to 78%
of those with four or more sets. Similarly, the frequency
of having infrequent contact with all sets of grandchil-
dren declines from 13% of those with one set to only
2% of those with four or more sets. Clearly grand-
parents who have multiple sets of grandchildren
nave much greater total contact with grandchildren
than do grandparents with only one set. On the other
hand, having multiple sets of grandchildren increases
the chances that some sets will be seen on an infre-
quent basis. When a grandparent has four or more
sets of grandchildren, it is more than three times as
likely that there is infrequent contact with at least
one set than if the grandparent has only one set
(47% vs 13%). Also, the probability of frequent con-
tact with all sets drops from 50% when there is one
set to only 6% when there are four or more. From the
perspective of an older person, having a large
number of grandchild sets implies a high level of total
interaction with grandchildren. From the perspective
of grandchildren, however, having multiple sets of
cousins reduces the likelihood of frequent contact
with grandparents. Although these findings are not
unexpected, they point out a serious limitation of

studies based on samples that include only the rela-
tionship between a grandparent and a focal child.
A second noteworthy finding from cross-tabulation
analysis concerns differences by gender and lineage.
As discussed above, previous studies have produced
inconsistent findings regarding differences between
grandmothers and grandfathers and differences be-
tween maternal and paternal grandparents. Results
from analyzing this large, national sample indicate that
both the grandparent's gender and lineage do mat-
ter, although not all of the differences are Targe (Table
1, Figure 3). The grandparent most likely to have
frequent contact with any particular set of grandchil-
dren is, as expected, the maternal grandmother. About
52% of maternal grandmothers have frequent contact
with any particular set of grandchildren, compared to
41% of maternal grandfathers. Further, maternal grand-
mothers are more likely to have frequent contact with
grandchildren than are paternal grandmothers (52%
vs 38%). On the other hand, there is no significant
difference between maternal and paternal grand-
fathers in frequent visiting, and the difference be-
tween paternal grandmothers and grandfathers is
small. It appears tnat having a daughter as the link to
the grandchildren is a salient factor for grandmothers
but not grandfathers. The same general pattern exists
when the focus is on infrequent visiting--maternal
grandmothers are least likely to visit infrequently
with a set of grandchildren, paternal grandfathers are
most likely to visit infrequently. A reasonable conclu-
sion is that the role of gender and lineage in pre-
dicting grandparent--grandchild interaction should be
neither neglected nor exaggerated.
Multivariate Analysis
To explore the effects of the independent variables
on frequency of grandparent-grandchild set contact
in a multivariate analysis, we ran separate logistic
regressions to predict frequent and infrequent con-
tact for grandfathers and grandmothers. The results of
these four analyses are shown in Table 2, where odds
ratios are presented. All of the odds ratios shown in
the table are statistically significant at .05. These re-
sults confirm most of our expectations regarding the
effect of various factors or frequency of grandparent
contact with a particular set of grandchildren.
The two key variables related to opportunity for
frequent contact come through strongly. Geographic
proximity is the most powerful predictor of either fre-
quent or infrequent contact, as every previous study
also has reported. Number of grandchild sets is also
significant in each analysis shown in Table 2. Living
further away and having multiple sets of grand-
children both predict that grandparents are less
likely to have frequent contact and are more likely
to have infrequent contact with their grandchildren.
Consistent with findings reported by Cherlin and
Furstenberg (1986), the other two indicators of op-
portunity do not have any significant effects. Having

poor health or being in the labor force do not appear
to interfere with the ability of grandparents to visit
with grandchildren. (Note, however, that grandparents
living in institutions are not included in this sample.)
The sociodemographic variables of age, race, and
education are included in the analyses, although no
particular expectations regarding tneir effects were
anticipated. An effect of age (net of health, marital
status, and other factors) is observed only for frequent
contact by grandmothers. In this one case there is evi-
dence of advanced age being associated with a lower
likelihood of frequent contact. Perhaps in this case age
is associated with greater difficulty in transportation,
but the total effect is not very great. The absence of
racial difference in frequency of contact suggests that
cultural difference in grandparenthood between Whites
and Blacks may not be significant. This conclusion,
however, needs to be qualified by the fact that Black
grandmothers are much more likely than White ones
to be coresiding with one set of grandchildren. (Cases
of coresidence between generations were excluded
from the analysis.) In the NSFH2 sample, 30% of Black
grandmothers lived in a household that contained one
or more sets of grandchildren, compared to 9% of
White grandmothers. Educational level was not a
significant predictor of frequent contact but was sig-
nificant for infrequent contact. Other things being
equal, grandparents with higher education are less
likely to have infrequent contact with their grandchil-
dren. The most straightforward interpretation of this
finding is that those with higher socioeconomic status
are more likely to have the necessary resources to over-
come obstacles to visiting with children and grand-
children.
A central interest of this study concerns the effects
of marital status, lineage, and affect on contact be-
tween grandparents and grandchild sets. In general,
each of these variables operates in the expected di-
rection. Consistent with previous studies, a more posi-
tive relationship between the grandparent and his/her
child is related to greater likelihood of frequent con-
tact with the grandchild set (and less likely infrequent
contact). Married grandparents tend to have more
freauent contact than their nonmarried counterparts.
Ana maternal grandparents are more likely to have
frequent contact than paternal ones. In addition, the
expectation that these variables differ by grandparents'
gender is confirmed.
Marital status is consistently of greater importance
in predicting contact with grandchildren for grand-
fathers than it is for grandmothers. In fact, widowed
grandmothers are not significantly less likely than mar-
ried ones to have frequent contact. Grandfathers who
are divorced, separated, or remarried are especially
unlikely, compared to their married counterparts, to
maintain frequent visiting patterns with their grand-
children. The importance of lineage, on the other hand,
is greater for grandmothers than grandfathers. Al-
though maternal grandmothers are much more likely
than paternal grandmothers to have frequent contact
with their grandchildren, maternal and paternal
grandfathers are not significantly different from each
other. Also, the quality of the relationship with a child
is a stronger predictor of frequent contact with a
grandchild for grandmothers than grandfathers. The
magnitude of the combined effect of gender, marital
status, and lineage on frequency of contact can be
made clearer by comparing predicted probabilities
that grandparents who differ on selected combinations
of these variables have frequent (or infrequent) con-
tact with any particular grandchild set. Using the
logistic regression equations, we predict the probabil-
ity of frequent (or infrequent) contact when all vari-
ables except marital status and lineage are set at
baseline values (baseline values, except for distance,
reflect sample means or modes). Specifically, we pre-
dict the probability of frequent contact for grand-
mothers and grandfathers with different combina-
tions of lineage and marital status when they have
the following characteristics: age = 62 years; race =
White; education = 12 years; health = good; rela-
tionship with child = excellent; distance = 30 miles;
number of grandchild sets = 2; and grandparent is
not in the labor force. The baseline values for predict-
ing infrequent contact are identical, except that dis-
tance is set at 500 miles. Results of this exercise are
shown in Table 3.

The effect of marital status on grandfathers' visiting
patterns with grandchildren is striking. Other things
being equal, married grandfathers are twice as likely
as widowed ones to see their grandchildren frequently
and about half as likely to see them on an infrequent
basis. Divorced, separated and remarried grandfathers
are even less likely to have frequent contact with grand-
children. When grandfathers do not have a spouse to
assist them in maintaining kinship ties, they are much
less likely to experience high levels of interaction with
their grandchildren. A considerably smaller effect of
marital status is observed for grandmothers: divorced
and separated grandmothers are about 75% as likely
to visit frequently with grandchildren as married ones.
The stronger bond typical between a mother and
daughter than between a mother and daughter-in-
law is reflected in lineage differences in predicted fre-
quency of contact between grandmothers and their
grandchild sets. Under the conditions specified above,
53% of maternal married grandmothers are predicted
to have frequent contact, compared to 40% of paternal
ones. Among grandfathers, it makes much less differ-
ence whether the link to their grandchildren is through
a son or a daughter. In combination, gender, marital
status, and lineage are found to sharply differentiate the
experience of grandparents. Comparing the extreme
categories in Table 3, one sees that maternal married
grandmothers are 3.5 times as likely to have frequent
contact with their grandchildren as paternal, separated,
or divorced grandfathers (.530 vs .153). The contrast
between these two categories in likelihood of having
infrequent contact is equally dramatic (.148 vs .520).
Conclusion
In conclusion, we first note that, based on a large
national sample of grandparent-grandchild set dyads,
six factors stand out as important predictors or fre-
quent or infrequent contact:
1. Geographic distance is the strongest predictor
of frequent or infrequent contact. All relevant studies
have found this result, and it is evident that most grand-
parents maintain frequent contact with their grand-
children when it is feasible to do so.
2. The quality of the relationship between a grand-
parent and his/ner child affects the quantity of con-
tact between the grandparent and that set of grand-
children. As reported by other studies, the middle gen-
eration may act as a gatekeeper for the grandparent-
grandchild relationship.
3. The number of grandchild sets makes a differ-
ence. As the number of sets increases, the likelihood
of frequent contact with any particular set decreases
and the likelihood of infrequent contact increases.
Nevertheless, the probability of having frequent con-
tact with at least one set of grandchildren is greater
for grandparents with multiple sets than for those with
only one set.
4. Gender of the grandparent is relevant. Grand-
mothers are more likely than grandfathers to have fre-
quent contact and are less likely to have infrequent
contact.
5. It makes a difference if grandparents are linked
to a set of grandchildren through a daughter or a son.
Maternal grandparents are more likely than paternal
grandparents to have frequent contact with sets of
grandchildren and less likely to have infrequent con-
tact. The effect of lineage is greater for grandmothers
than grandfathers.
6. Grandparents' marital status has a significant
effect on the likelihood of frequent or infrequent con-
tact with grandchildren. This effect is especially strong
for grandfathers. For both grandmothers and grand-
fathers, the ordering from most to least likely to have
frequent contact is married, widowed, remarried, di-
vorced.
The most important conclusion to draw from this
analysis is that grandparenting needs to be examined
within a complete kinship framework where gender
matters. Starting with G1, it makes a difference whether
the grandparent is a grandmother or a grandfather. It
makes a difference whether or not the grandparent
has experienced marital disruption. It makes a dif-
ference how many grandchild sets the grandparent
has. And it makes a difference whether the grand-
parent is linked to grandchildren through a son or a
daughter. In other words, general discussions of grand-
parenting are of limited usefulness. The relationship
between a grandparent and a grandchild is always
located within a particular kinship network. Differences
in kinship networks help to explain differences in
grandparenting behaviors.

This study overcomes a limitation of most previous
grandparenting studies by having a large, nationally
representative sample of grandparents. There are,
nevertheless, three significant limitations related to
using these data from NSFH2. The first, apparent to
a perceptive reader, is that contact between grand-
parents and grandchild sets is not measured directly.
As discussed in the Appendix, there is good evidence
that frequency of contact between G1 and G2 is a
reasonable proxy for frequency of contact for the cor-
responding G1-G3 relationship, but it would be much
better to measure this directly. A second limitation is
that information on characteristics of the individual
grandchildren is not available. The third limitation is
that consequences of contact frequency cannot ad-
equately be assessed. Hopefully more complete infor-
mation on the grandparent-grandchild relationship
will be collected in future surveys so that the findings
suggested by this analysis can be examined more rig-
orously and their significance explored more fully.
As the literature on intergenerational relationships,
including grandparent-grandchild relationships, grows,
we are gaining new insights into the role of kin ties in
the aging experience. It is not surprising that these
new insights stimulate new questions that require
additional research. To deepen our understanding of
grandparenting, future studies might explore the fol-
lowing questions: What are the implications of chang-
ing family gender roles for relationships between
generations? Although grandfathers in aggregate have
different relationships with grandchildren than grand-
mothers, it is obvious that there is great diversity among
both grandfathers and grandmothers. Some grand-
fathers are highly involved with their grandchildren;
some grandmothers are marginally involved with their
grandchildren. Do fathers who play a more active role
in caring for their young children later develop into
grandfathers who are more engaged with their grand-
children? Do mothers who turn over much of the par-
enting role to others develop into less engaged grand-
mothers?
Greater attention needs to be given to how grand-
parents relate to different sets of grandchildren and
to different grandchildren within a set. The first step,
of course, is to directly measure grandparent contact
and relationship with each set of grandchildren and
with each grandchild in each set. Then the question
of what leads to differential involvement can be ex-
plored. In addition to factors suggested by findings of
this study, attention should be given to the relation-
ship between the grandparent and the spouse of
the child who links him or her to the grandchildren.
It will be important to examine how the needs of vari-
ous grandchild sets affect the relative share of the
grandparents' attention that they receive. And char-
acteristics that differentiate grandparental attention
among siblings in a set could be explored.
As the study of intergenerational relationships pro-
gresses, it becomes increasingly clear that relation-
ships develop over time. Cross-sectional studies that
attempt to explain grandparent-grandchild relationships
by focusing on characteristics at one point in time are
simply inadequate. New efforts should be made to
include information on the process through which
relationships develop and change. Well designed lon-
gitudinal studies are ideal for this purpose, but it also
is possible to collect retrospective life course histories
that shed light on the development of relationships.
The G1-G2 relationship, which plays such an im-
portant role in the G1-G3 relationship, has a history.
Are there critical events in the parent-child relation-
ship that later pull grandparents and grandchildren
together, or which drive them apart? Exploration of
these issues must await the collection of appropriate
data.
Finally, the consequences of differing levels of mu-
tual engagement of grandparent and grandchildren
need to be examined more carefully. Are there direct
benefits to both generations that come from maintain-
ing frequent contact and high emotional attachment?
Beyond the individual level, it also is worth asking how
grandparent-grandchild connections might benefit
the larger society. A number of social changes over
the past century have tended to increase age segrega-
tion in our society: changes in schools, work, churches,
age-graded organizations, retirement, and extended
family living arrangements. The most significant link-
ages across age groups probably occur because of kin-
ship ties. How important are grandparent-grandchild
connections in preserving age integration? And what
are the factors that enhance the quantity and quality
of these intergenerational relationships?

Appendix
To assess how well frequency of G1-G2 contact serves
as a proxy for frequency of C1-G3 contact, we examine
cases where C1 reports only one child with children in
his/her household. The respondents (G1) report how fre-
quently they have contact with each child and with their
grandchildren (both on a scale from 1 to 6). When there
is only one set of grandchildren, we expect that in most
cases the contact reported with grandchildren will be the
frequency of contact they have with the grandchild set
of the child who has children in his/her household. (The
exceptions would be when grandparents have other grand-
children not living in their parents' household. Thus some
grandparents might be reporting frequency of contact
with a grandchild who is not in the set of interest. We
expect the results would be even stronger if there were a
way to exclude these cases.) As reported in the text, in
86% of the cases the frequency of contact with the child
and with grandchildren is either identical or in an adja-
cent category.
To examine how robust the results of Table 2 are, we
ran the logistic regressions restricted to cases where there
is just one set of grandchildren (n = 1,243). We com-
pare the results of this regression model when the de-
pendent variable is frequent (or infrequent) contact be-
tween G1-G2 (as in Table 2) with the results when the
dependent variable is frequent (or infrequent) contact
between G1-G3. In this analysis we must, of course, drop
number of grandchild sets as an independent variable.
In addition, we have made marital status of the grand-
parent a dichotomous variable (married to other parent
of G2 vs other), and we have included gender of the
grandparent as an independent variable. The results are
shown in Table 4 for the variables of interest.
Overall, the results presented in Table 4 suggest that
using G1-G2 contact as a proxy for G1-G3 is not prob-
lematic. The only exception might be with the effect of
maternal lineage. It is plausible, however, that lineage is
not significant in the special case where grandparents have
only one set of grandchildren. Paternal grandparents with
only one set of grandchildren will not see any grandchil-
dren if they do not see their son's grandchildren.
