Introduction
Glucocorticoid administration for the prevention of com-
plications related to prematurity has been standard care
for women with preterm labor before 35 weeks gesta-
tion since 1994.1 A single course of antenatal betametha-
sone accelerates fetal lung maturation and enhances the
survival of preterm infants. However, this regimen has
been associated with higher blood pressure in adoles-
cence and decreased insulin sensitivity and renal function
in adulthood.2,3
Studies using sheep experimental models demonstrate
that prenatal glucocorticoid exposure results in elevated
blood pressure in adulthood.4,5 The reasons for this increase
are not fully known: however, the mechanisms are likely to
involve a reduction in nephron number6,7 and alterations
in the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and renal
function.5,8,9
The RAS plays an essential role in controlling sodium
and water excretion. While angiotensin II (ANG II) is con-
sidered the predominant RAS mediator,10­12 angiotensin
-(1­7) (ANG- (1­7)) can produce a number of physiologi-
cal effects, including natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and
the release of vasopressin and prostaglandins11,13,14 Both
ANG II and ANG-(1­7) exert their effects by binding to
specific receptors: angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and
angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) for ANG II and the Mas
receptor for ANG-(1­7).15­18 We have speculated, based

Abstract
Antenatal corticosteroid exposure reduces renal function and alters the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system to favor
angiotensin activation of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) mediated responses in ovine offspring. This study aimed
to assess whether antenatal steroid exposure would affect renal responses to the direct intrarenal infusion of angioten-
sin-(1­7) in rams and the angiotensin receptors involved in mediating responses to the peptide.
Adult, uninephrectomized rams exposed to either betamethasone or vehicle before birth received intrarenal angioten-
sin-(1­7) infusions (1 ng/kg/min) alone or in combination with antagonists to angiotensin receptors for 3 h. Basal sodium
excretion (UNa) was significantly lower and mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in betamethasone- compared
to the vehicle-treated sheep. Angiotensin-(1­7) decreased UNa more in betamethasone- than in vehicle-treated sheep.
Candesartan reversed the response to angiotensin-(1­7) but D-Ala7-angiotensin-(1­7) did not. Angiotensin-(1­7) infu-
sion decreased effective renal plasma flow in both groups to a similar extent and the response was reversed by candes-
artan, but was not blocked by D-Ala7-angiotensin-(1­7). Glomerular filtration rate increased significantly in both groups
after 3 h infusion of angiotensin-(1­7) plus candesartan. These results suggest that antenatal exposure to a clinically
relevant dose of betamethasone impairs renal function in rams. Moreover, angiotensin-(1­7) appears capable of activat-
ing the AT1R in uninephrectomized rams.

upon the results of several studies, that one of the global
effects of antenatal betamethasone exposure is a shift in the
balance of ANG II to ANG-(1­7) favoring responses
mediated by activation of the AT1R pathway by several
means including alterations in receptor expression.19­21
At this point, however, there is limited information on
the effects of antenatal betamethasone exposure on renal
responses to ANG-(1­7). Based upon results of studies
with systemic infusions of ANG-(1­7) in our model,19,22 we
hypothesized that responses to direct infusions of ANG-
(1­7) into the kidney would be attenuated in adult sheep
that had been exposed to betamethasone prenatally. To test
this hypothesis we infused a low dose of ANG-(1­7)
directly into the renal artery in a group of 12 adult male
uninephrectomized sheep of which half were exposed to
betamethasone and the remainder to vehicle at 0.6 gestation
and measured aspects of renal function.
Materials and methods
Animal preparation
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Wake Forest University School
of Medicine. Time-dated pregnant ewes were randomly
assigned to receive either two 0.17 mg×kg-1 intramuscular
injections of a 1:1 mixture of betamethasone acetate and
betamethasone phosphate (Celestone Soluspan, Schering,
Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA) or vehicle alone which con-
tained 3.4 mg of monobasic sodium phosphate, 7.1 mg of
dibasic sodium phosphate, 0.1 mg of sodium ethylenedi-
aminetetra-acetic acid, and 0.2 mg of benzalkonium chlo-
rine per ml given 24 h apart at days 80 and 81 of gestation.
The ewes were allowed to deliver naturally at term (term is
approximately 145 days in our flock).
Male offspring (five or six in each group) were trans-
ferred to the laboratory at 12­18 months of age. The
research team was blinded to the sheep allocation. The tem-
perature in the laboratory facilities and in the sheep pens
was kept stable at 20±2°C, and the humidity at approxi-
mately 35­40%. Sheep were fed a standard commercial
diet (PMI Rumilab® Brentwood, Missouri, USA) contain-
ing 0.75% NaCl and had ad libitum access to clean tap
water. Twelve hour day/night light cycles were maintained
throughout the experiment.
Surgical procedure
A midline suprapubic laparotomy was made in the lower
abdomen to expose the bladder. A 14 French silicone Foley
catheter (Bard Medical, Covington, Georgia, USA) was
placed in the bladder and exteriorized through the left flank.
Two polyvinyl catheters were placed in the left carotid
artery and two catheters were inserted into the left external
jugular vein. These were tunneled subcutaneously and
emerged through a left anterior neck incision. All vascular
catheters were fastened to their corresponding vessels and
the distal vessels were all ligated.
A paravertebral left or right flank incision was made to
expose the corresponding renal artery. A modified, Teflon
coated, 22 gauge endovascular catheter 25 mm long and
with a 0.9 mm external diameter was placed into the left or
right renal artery in a non occlusive fashion and attached to
a Tygon catheter. The Tygon catheter was tunneled a short
distance to emerge adjacent to the spine. We then removed
the contralateral kidney.
All the animals received daily intravenous doses of
ampicillin 1000 mg, gentamicin 80 mg and ketorolac 100
mg on the day of surgery and two days thereafter. All vas-
cular catheters were flushed with a heparin solution on a
daily basis to confirm patency. During the post-operative
period and throughout the experimental period, each pair of
animals was housed together in individual carts with free
access to food and water.
Protocol of experiments
After allowing five days for recovery, sheep underwent a
series of experiments to evaluate the response to a 3 h infu-
sion of ANG-(1­7) alone or in combination with specific
antagonists. The sequence of infused substances was: (a)
saline (1 ng/kg/min); (b) ANG-(1­7) (1 ng/kg/min, Bachem
BioScience Inc., Torrance, California, USA); (c)ANG-(1­7)
and D-Ala7-angiotensin-(1­7) (D-Ala-ANG-(1­7)) (10 ng/
kg/min, Bachem BioScience Inc., Torrance, California,
USA); (d) D-Ala-ANG-(1­7) (10 ng/kg/min, Bachem
BioScience Inc., Torrance, California, USA); (e)ANG-(1­7)
and candesartan (AT1R antagonist, 0.3 mg/kg by bolus injec-
tion via renal artery,Astra Zeneca, Möindal, Sweden) and (f)
candesartan alone (AT1R antagonist, 0.3 mg/kg by bolus
injection via renal artery, Astra Zeneca, Möindal, Sweden).
All drugs were infused directly into the renal artery with
syringes mounted on a multichannel pump. The dose for
ANG-(1­7) and candesartan were obtained from our previ-
ous work documenting ANG II effects during intrarenal
infusions in sheep.23 The dose of ANG-(1­7) was equivalent
to ANG II because part of our long-term goal is to determine
if antenatal betamethasone alters the relative efficacy of
these two peptides in the kidney. The dose of D-Ala-
ANG-(1­7) was obtained from a previous study in which
D-Ala-ANG-(1­7) at a 10-fold higher dose than ANG-(1­7)
was able to abolish the effect of ANG-(1­7).24 We didn't
evaluate higher doses of D-Ala-ANG-(1­7) because they
can potentially elicit nonspecific effects.13 Forty-eight to 72
h were allowed between experiments for adequate clearance
of previously infused drugs. Not all of the animals received
all of the treatments due to occasional catheter failure.
Blood and urine samples were serially obtained prior to
initiating all infusions, subsequent to initiating infusions
and over the course of the following 3 h.
292 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)
To guarantee adequate hydration status we administered
2000 ml of normal saline intravenously the afternoon prior
to beginning each experiment. After all experiments had
concluded, the animals were euthanized with 10 ml
Beuthanasia D® (390 mg pentobarbital sodium and 50 mg
phenytoin sodium per ml) intravenously, after which organ
harvesting was performed.
Blood and urine samples
Timed samples of blood and urine were collected 1 h prior
to beginning any infusion and at the end of the infusions.
Urine samples were collected in plain tubes. All blood
and urine samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm, 4ºC, for
10 min immediately after collection, aliquoted and stored
at -20°C for subsequent analysis. Urine volumes were
recorded.
Blood pressure measurement
Mean arterial blood pressure was monitored continuously
throughout each experiment with a Cobe transducer con-
nected to a DigiMed analyzer, which digitized the arterial
blood pressure signal that was then recorded on a computer.
Pressure was sampled at 100 Hz and averaged over 1 min
intervals. The reported blood pressure values are the aver-
age blood pressure over 1 h prior to the time point reported.
Urinary concentration of electrolytes
Urinary concentrations of electrolytes were determined
using a Medical Easy-Lyte instrument (Bedford,
Massachusetts, USA). Prior to measuring the samples, the
machine underwent the manufacturer recommended proce-
dures which included a cleaning cycle for the probe, ana-
lyzer calibration and use of standardized control samples.
The instrument's margin of error for urinary electrolytes is
5%. All results are reported as mmol/l.
Changes of fractional excretion of sodium
(FENa)
Changes of FENa were determined by subtracting the
value of FENa at 3 h from that at baseline. The following
formula was used for FENa: FENa=sodium excretion/
(plasma sodium concentration×glomerular filtration rate
(GFR)).
GFR measurement
GFR was measured using an anthrone method and a colori-
metric assay for determining the concentration of plasma
inulin as previously described.25­27 The following formula
was used for GFR (ml/min)=rate of inulin infusion (mg/
min)/plasma inulin (mg/ml).
Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF)
Plasma para-aminohippurate (PAH) was measured using a
previously described colorimetric assay.28 Renal PAH
excretion was used to derive effective plasma flow rate
(ERPF) according to the following formula: ERPF= rate of
PAH infusion (mg/min)/plasma PAH (mg/ml).
Plasma ANG-(1­7)
Blood for measurement of ANG-(1­7) was collected into
chilled tubes containing a mixture of 25 mmol/l ethylene-
diamine-tetraacetic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis,
Missouri, USA), 0.44 mmol/l 1,20-orthophenanthrolene
monohydrate, 1 mmol/l Na+ para-chloromercuribenzoate,
and 3 mol/l of WFML (rat renin inhibitor: acetyl-His-Pro-
Phe-Val-Statine-Leu-Phe). The concentration of ANG-(1­
7) was measured by radioimmunoassay described
previously.29,30
Statistical analysis
The study data were tabulated and graphed using Prism
software (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, California, USA).
Statistical analysis was accomplished with the use of t-test
and two-way analysis of variance for repeated measure-
ments. Means between the betamethasone- and vehicle-
exposed sheep were compared. A p-value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The data are reported as
means±standard error of the mean (SEM). Except for blood
pressure all other measurements were normalized by body
weight.
Results
Body weights and remaining kidney weights
The mean body weights at the time of experiments were no
different between vehicle- and betamethasone-treated
sheep. At the time of necropsy the mean weight of the
remaining kidney in betamethasone-treated sheep was sim-
ilar to that in vehicle-treated animals (Table 1).
Basal sodium excretion
Basal sodium excretion was lower in betamethasone com-
pared to vehicle-treated sheep (0.33±0.02 mmol/h/kg vs
0.53±0.06 mmol/h/kg, p<0.05).
Plasma ANG-(1­7) concentration
We measured plasma ANG-(1­7) in a subset of both
groups of sheep following intrarenal infusion of the pep-
tide. Plasma levels of ANG-(1­7) did not increase signifi-
cantly as compared to baseline in either the vehicle- or
Bi et al. 293
betamethasone-treated groups (7±1 pg/ml to 9±5 pg/ml in
vehicle sheep, n=3; 7±2 pg/ml to 8±3 pg/ml in betametha-
sone sheep, n=4).
Sodium excretion
Sodium excretion was unchanged in betamethasone- and
vehicle-treated sheep during 3 h intrarenal infusion of
either saline, D-Ala-ANG-(1­7), or candesartan (data not
shown). Infusion of ANG-(1­7) alone decreased sodium
excretion in both groups (F=8.8, p=0.02) and there was a
significant effect of betamethasone (F=5.6, p=0.04) (Figure
1(A)). This antinatriuretic response was not blocked by the
ANG-(1­7) receptor antagonist D-Ala-ANG-(1­7) (Figure
1(B)): however, a significant increase in sodium excretion
in both groups of sheep was apparent during infusion of
ANG-(1­7) with the AT1R antagonist candesartan. There
was a significant effect of ANG-(1­7)/candesartan infusion
(F=18.1, p=0.003) and betamethasone (F=8.8, p=0.02)
(Figure 1(C)).
Changes of FENa
Changes in the FENa in both groups are shown in (Figure 2).
There was an overall effect of the treatment on FENa (F=7.4,
p<0.01). There was a significant effect in both vehicle- and
betamethasone-treated sheep (p<0.05, Bonferroni post-
tests) between infusion of ANG-(1­7) with D-Ala-
ANG-(1­7) and infusion of ANG-(1­7) with candesartan.
Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
The betamethasone exposed animals had higher resting
MAPs than did the vehicle-treated sheep (83.5±1.9 mm Hg
vs 76.9±1.4 mm Hg, p<0.05). MAP did not change signifi-
cantly during any of the intrarenal infusions (data not
shown).
ERPF
Saline, D-Ala-ANG-(1­7), and candesartan did not alter
ERPF significantly in either group of sheep (data not
shown). However, infusion of ANG-(1­7) decreased ERPF
in both groups (F=12.8, p=0.004) to a similar extent (Figure
3(A)). Infusion of ANG-(1­7) and D-Ala-ANG-(1­7) also
decreased ERPF significantly in both groups (F=7.0,
p=0.02) with no significant difference in the response
between vehicle- and betamethasone-treated sheep (Figure
3(B)). In contrast, ERPF increased similarly in both groups
of sheep after 3 h infusion of ANG-(1­7) and candesartan
(F=44.4, p=0.0002) (Figure 3(C)).
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
After 3 h infusion of saline, D-Ala-ANG-(1­7), or cande-
sartan, GFR was unchanged (data not shown). GFR tended
to decrease after ANG-(1­7) infusion with or without
D-Ala-ANG-(1­7), but the difference did not reach statisti-
cal significance (Figure 4(A) and (B)). However, GFR
increased to about the same level in both groups of sheep

Discussion
The present experiments determined whether antenatal bet-
amethasone treatment would reduce the renal responses to
direct intrarenal infusions of ANG-(1­7), a heptapeptide
thought to counterbalance the effects of the ANG II-AT1R
axis.31 We found that antenatal betamethasone exposure
magnified an inhibitory effect of ANG-(1­7) on sodium
excretion and that this response was not blocked by D-Ala-
ANG-(1­7), a selective antagonist for the Mas receptor for
which ANG-(1­7) is a naturally occurring ligand.32
However, simultaneous intrarenal administration of ANG-
(1­7) and the AT1R antagonist candesartan, converted the
antinatriuresis to a natriuretic response with higher levels
of sodium excretion in the vehicle- than in the betametha-
sone-treated sheep. Moreover, a reduction in renal plasma
flow was observed in both groups along with a tendency for
a reduction in GFR following ANG-(1­7) infusion. These
responses were also reversed by candesartan but not D-Ala-
ANG-(1­7). Considered together, the data suggest that
antenatal betamethasone exposure alters the renal responses
to ANG-(1­7) and that unilateral nephrectomy modulates
these responses independent of any effects induced by ante-
natal steroid treatment. We chose intrarenal infusion of
ANG-(1­7) in an attempt to influence renal function
directly and avoid any confounding systemic effects, such
as changes in blood pressure, resulting from significant
elevations in the peripheral plasma levels of the peptide.
Indeed, the intrarenal infusion protocol did not alter circu-
lating levels of ANG-(1­7) nor influence blood pressure.
The data in the literature on the effects of ANG-(1­7) on
sodium excretion are conflicting. Multiple reports indicate
the peptide increases sodium excretion and /or urine flow in
rodents,33­35 dogs36 and sheep.19,22 Consistent with these
findings are in vitro studies that ANG-(1­7) acts on the
proximal tubule to inhibit sodium uptake.32 In contrast,
there are several observations that ANG-(1­7) has antidiu-
retic/antinatriuretic effects in vivo and in vitro.32 There is
reasonable agreement that ANG-(1­7) is a naturally occur-
ring ligand for the Mas receptor and thus many of its effects
are mediated via binding to that receptor,37 but ANG-(1­7)
may also interact with AT1 and AT2 receptors.37 In our stud-
ies the inhibition of sodium excretion does not appear to be
associated with activation of the Mas receptor as the
response was not blocked by D-Ala-ANG-(1­7). The fact

that the antinatriuretic effect was converted to a natriuresis
by the addition of candesartan implies some interaction
with the AT1 receptor which may be opposed by either the
Mas or AT2 receptors. This idea is further supported by the
changes in the FENa following the different infusions in
both groups. Thus, in the presence of AT1R blockade, the
ANG-(1­7) induced response converted from a decrease to
an increase in FENa. Whether the latter is blocked by
D-Ala-ANG-(1­7) or an AT2R antagonist awaits further
study, but complex interactions among these receptors and
ANG-(1­7) have been noted in studies on the cardiac effects
of the peptide.38,39
While we do not have data for sodium excretion before
uninephrectomy in this cohort, comparisons with the
intact sheep from a different cohort in our previous study22
reveal some changes in sodium excretion. Specifically,
basal sodium excretion in these vehicle-treated unine-
phrectomized sheep was about twice that found earlier in
vehicle-treated intact males.22 This is consistent with the
study by Shirley et al. which showed that excretion rates
of sodium were approximately 2-fold higher in the remain-
ing kidney of uninephrectomized rats.40 Uninephectomy
of adult animal results in compensatory renal growth, but
does not involve formation of new nephrons. The signifi-
cant decrease in basal sodium excretion in uninephrecto-
mized, betamethasone-treated sheep (compared to vehicle)
strongly suggests that the impaired sodium excretion in
this model is directly associated with the antenatal beta-
methasone exposure while the decrease in sodium excre-
tion caused by ANG-(1­7) seems related to the additional
loss of nephrons from the unilateral nephrectomy.
Uninephectomy immediately stimulates the growth and
function of the remaining kidney.41 There are differential
mechanisms initiating the early compensatory renal
growth response and functional adaptation,42 including
a number of endocrine, biochemical, and molecular
changes,43,44 which result in glomerular hyperfiltration,
renal hypertrophy, and compensatory changes of trans-
porters.42 Regarding the RAS, ANG II and increased
AT1R may mediate the growth of the remaining kid-
ney.45,46 It is unclear whether or notANG-(1­7) is involved
in these changes. However, it is certainly possible that any
of the adaptations mentioned above could modulate the
responses to betamethasone and ANG-(1­7).
The role of ANG-(1­7) in the regulation of renal plasma
flow is not clear. It has been reported that ANG-(1­7)
causes afferent arteriolar vasodilatation and, even if devoid
of any vasodilator actions by itself, it at least antagonizes
the renal vasoconstrictor effects of ANG II.47 Others, how-
ever, have found that ANG-(1­7) does not exert vasodilator
and/or ANG II opposing actions in the renal circulation.48
Although it is difficult to reconcile such contradictory
findings, based on their comprehensive analysis of studies
regarding the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of
ANG-(1­7), Santos et al.49 have suggested that the overall
activity of the RAS, as it results from experimental manipu-
lations, markedly influences MAP and renal functional
responses to ANG-(1­7). Antenatal betamethasone expo-
sure can alter the balance between angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 expression implying that the
overall activity of the RAS may be changed in the animals
in the present study.50
The intrarenal infusion of ANG-(1­7) suppressed renal
plasma flow in both vehicle- and antenatal betametha-
sone-treated sheep to a similar extent in the absence of

changes in MAP. This suppression may have been the
result of vasoconstriction via AT1 receptor activation
because candesartan, not D-Ala-ANG-(1­7), reversed the
suppression.
We have previously reported increases in arterial
blood pressure in sheep exposed to betamethasone before
birth.8,22,51,52 Consistent with these results, the MAP in ante-
natal betamethasone-treated sheep is significantly higher
than in vehicle-exposed sheep in the present study. The
mean difference is similar to that previously reported51 and
would not be accounted for by unilateral nephrectomy in
our study. None of the infusions changed MAP in these
studies, suggesting that their effects were confined to
actions directly on the kidney. Thus, for example, intrave-
nous administration of candesartan lowers MAP in beta-
methasone-exposed sheep,52 but our intrarenal infusion had
no effect on MAP. Absence of peripheral effects is also sup-
ported by the fact that we did not find a significant increase
in the plasma levels of ANG-(1­7) during the intrarenal
infusions of the peptide.
Basal GFR tended to decrease in antenatal betametha-
sone-treated sheep but the reduction was not significant.
Although the GFR did not significantly change during
intrarenal infusion of ANG-(1­7) alone or with D-Ala-
ANG-(1­7), renal plasma flow (RPF) decreased. Thus, the
decrease in RPF was perhaps caused by contraction of both
afferent and efferent arterioles. The GFR increased signifi-
cantly in both groups during intrarenal infusion of ANG-
(1­7) with candesartan. The simultaneous increase in RPF
may have contributed to this increase.
GFR values in the present study are different than
those we found in intact sheep at 1­2 years of age. In both
the vehicle- and betamethasone-treated uninephrecto-
mized animals, absolute GFR values are lower than the
corresponding values in intact sheep.22 The decline in
GFR produced by uninephrectomy in these adult sheep
agrees with data from other animal studies53 and with
observations in human living kidney donors.54­56
However, single nephron GFR must be increased after
the unilateral nephrectomy because the reduction in
nephron number was 50% while the decline in GFR was,
at most, 25%. It is possible that the increase in single
nephron GFR could partially explain the increased
sodium excretion in these animals.
In conclusion, the present findings indicate that prenatal
exposure to a clinically relevant dose of betamethasone
modulates renal responses to ANG-(1­7) in uninephrecto-
mized, adult sheep.
