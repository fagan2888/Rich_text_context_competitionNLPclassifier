Abstract
A key question regarding the ongoing process of digitalization is whether it enables
societies to overcome patterns of inequality or whether these patterns are fostered in
the digital sphere. The article addresses this question for the case of online volunteering
by examining the profiles of online and offline volunteers in terms of sociodemographics,
resources, networks, and psychological engagement. We apply quantitative methods
using a unique data set that provides comprehensive information on online volunteering.
Our results suggest that two mechanisms are at work simultaneously: mobilization and
reinforcement. The profile of "pure" online volunteers differs from the profile of "pure"
offline volunteers (mobilization). Meanwhile, the hybrid type combining online and
offline volunteering attracts individuals resembling offline (reinforcement) and online
volunteers (mobilization). Thus, online volunteering seems to be both: a remedy for
existing inequalities in volunteering and a way to reinforce existing patterns of social
participation in increasingly digitized societies.

Introduction
Ever since the Internet became available to a broad public, it has rapidly changed our
daily lives. It has changed the way we communicate, work, search information, and
engage in many other everyday activities (Haythornthwaite and Wellman, 2002; Rainie
and Wellman, 2012). Hardly surprising, the Internet also opened up new pathways for
unpaid benevolent activities and engagement such as volunteering. Online volunteering
is a side effect of the currently unfolding overarching process of digitalization. However,
empirical evidence on online volunteering and its individual-level determinants is scarce.
For traditional offline volunteering, levels of engagement, for example, in terms of asso-
ciational volunteering, are decreasing, especially among young people (Freitag et al.,
2016; Putnam, 2000). Given the well-documented beneficial impact of offline volunteer-
ing on individuals and societies--ranging from improved individual well-being, to occu-
pational achievements, up to decreased neighborhood crime rates, and so on (Putnam,
2000; Wilson, 2000)--unequal civic participation constitutes an increasing societal con-
cern. In this respect, a key question is whether new forms of engagement such as online
volunteering can overcome these patterns of inequality or whether they are exacerbated
in the digital sphere.1
Such inequalities represent a threat to social cohesion, and the associated lack of
social capital harms the excluded strata of society. Thus, it is important to examine
whether online volunteering helps to overcome or foster these inequalities. Theoretically,
we follow the arguments made by Vissers and Stolle (2014) on online political participa-
tion. On one hand, the Internet might be yet another tool for volunteering that attracts the
same people as offline volunteering (see also Robles et al., 2013). Thus, it might rein-
force existing patterns of stratification regarding the resources, motivations, and net-
works of volunteers. On the other hand, differences in the nature of online and offline
volunteering might also mobilize different kinds of people. If that is the case, online
volunteering has the potential to democratize volunteering by attracting individuals who
do not carry out offline social work. This would be a sign of hope for those who fear that
digitalization will foster existing structures of inequality in society.
Existing research often focuses on specific activities on the Internet that fall in the
category of online volunteering, such as contributing to a Wikipedia entry (Amichai-
Hamburger et al., 2008; Loveland and Reagle, 2013) or the free provision of resources,
for instance via Couchsurfing (Rosen et al., 2011). The aim of this article is, however, to
comprehensively examine online volunteering from a theoretical and empirical perspec-
tive using data from a representative population survey. We approach the topic in an
exploratory manner and build on different strands of literature. To develop theoretical
expectations, we draw on the research scrutinizing the correlates of volunteering (see
Wilson, 2000, 2012, for an overview), in particular the Civic Voluntarism Model (CVM)
proposed by Verba et al. (1995). Furthermore, we refer to conceptual research on online
volunteering (e.g.Amichai-Hamburger, 2008) as well as studies focusing on online polit-
ical participation (Oser et al., 2013; Vissers and Stolle, 2014). We use the Swiss
Volunteering Survey 2014 to test our arguments empirically, since this is the first repre-
sentative population survey that includes a measure of online volunteering. In interna-
tional comparison, Switzerland ranks regularly among the leading countries, exhibiting
Ackermann and Manatschal 3
the highest associational volunteering rate besides Germany and the Netherlands in
Europe (Freitag et al., 2016).At the same time, offline voluntary engagement is declining
in Switzerland (Freitag et al., 2016), which makes it a paradigmatic case to study online
as compared to offline volunteering.
Multinomial Heckman selection models reveal that both mechanisms seem to be at
work, reinforcement and mobilization. While the CVM is able to explain offline-only
volunteering, online-only volunteering is driven by different determinants. The explana-
tions converge in the hybrid type that combines offline and online volunteering.
Additional analyses show that the CVM is especially unable to explain volunteering of
younger generations for whom online volunteering seems to be particularly attractive.
Who volunteers?
Volunteering is generally defined as "any activity in which time is given freely to ben-
efit another person, group, or organization" (Wilson, 2000: 215). Although this is
rarely made explicit, most people still associate volunteering primarily with real-life or
"offline" activities. Existing research distinguishes mainly two manifestations of this
kind of offline volunteering: formal volunteering occurring within an organization or
association, and informal volunteering outside of organizations such as neighborhood
help (Carson, 1999; Stadelmann-Steffen et al., 2010; Wilson and Musick, 1997). What
distinguishes these activities from wage work is the fact that volunteers receive no (or
only symbolic) remuneration for their productive voluntary engagement, although
recipients of these acts clearly benefit from this kind of volunteering (Bühlmann and
Schmid, 1999).
To explain volunteering in terms of individual-level determinants, different models
are discussed in the literature focusing on factors such as subjective dispositions, human
resources, the life course, and social contexts (for an overview, see Wilson, 2012). We
make use of an approach that integrates different aspects into one comprehensive model:
the CVM. Following this model proposed by Verba et al. (1995), the correlates of politi-
cal and social participation can be distinguished along three lines: resources, recruitment,
and engagement. To start with, volunteering is linked to human resources and individual
sociodemographic factors that relate to time, money, and skills (Verba et al. 1995: 271).
Undisputedly, education represents one of the most powerful and consistent predictors of
virtually all forms of volunteering (Gesthuizen et al., 2008; Janoski et al., 1998; Putnam,
2000: 118, Wilson, 2012). Highly educated individuals have certain capabilities and
knowledge, and a broader sensitization for societal challenges (Gesthuizen and Scheepers,
2012). Furthermore, highly educated individuals have generally higher status jobs and
are therefore more likely to be asked to volunteer than lowly educated individuals
(Janoski et al., 1998; Wilson, 2012). A related factor to time resources is age. The link
between age and volunteering is not assumed to be perfectly linear, but in general it is
expected to be positive. While the school context might be fruitful for volunteering,
young adults have a low probability to do voluntary work (Wilson, 2000, 2012). In mid-
dle age, when people typically have established their professional career and founded a
family, the rates of volunteering rise. Different mechanisms may account for this effect.
The entrance of kids in schools might generate free time and provide opportunities for
4 new media & society 00(0)
volunteering through children's activities (Wilson, 2000). Moreover, a change in values
and attitudes over the life course might also account for rising rates of volunteering.
Especially, individuals in their later life might value volunteering more because they
realize that they will themselves need help in the near future (Wilson, 2000). There is,
however, little evidence that people start to volunteer after retirement because they
gained time resources. Volunteering seems to be more like a habit that people develop
over the life course (Wilson, 2012). Finally, the relationship between gender and volun-
teering is rather complex. While women are more likely to hold pro-social values and
norms, so to say social skills that fuel volunteering, men are more likely to attain the
necessary civic skills through jobs and education (Schlozman et al., 1994; Wilson, 2000).
Thus, gender effects are highly dependent on the form of voluntary work as well as the
stage in the life cycle (Wilson, 2000, 2012).
Apart from sociodemographics and human resources, volunteering is--to a varying
extent--a collective activity facilitated by recruitment through social networks such as
friendships and organizational memberships. These social networks supply information,
provide support, and create obligations (Wilson and Musick, 1997). In particular,
churches and religious institutions provide a contextual setting that is fruitful for the
establishment of the aforementioned social networks and the promotion of social norms
(Traunmüller, 2012). Religious institutions offer opportunities to obtain civic skills and
gather information, turning religion into a gateway to other forms of social participation
(Lam, 2006; Ruiter and De Graaf, 2006). Especially, Protestantism is found to increase
the propensity to volunteer because of its participatory structures and values (Ruiter and
De Graaf, 2006; Traunmüller, 2012).
Finally, psychological engagement plays a key role in volunteering. While concrete
motives for one or the other voluntary work might differ, norms of generalized reciproc-
ity as well as social trust likely serve as a general motivational basis for volunteering.
Existing research reveals clear connections between pro-social norms such as different
manifestations of reciprocal norms or trust and various forms of offline volunteering
(Manatschal, 2015; Manatschal and Freitag, 2014; Putnam, 2000). Drawing on Putnam's
(2000: 118) notion that altruistic behaviors and attitudes "tend to go together," general-
ized reciprocity expressing the idea that "doing good always pays off" and social trust
should thus coincide with a higher propensity to volunteer.
Bringing online volunteering into the picture
If volunteering is highly dependent on resources, recruitment, and psychological engage-
ment, unequal provision of these factors implies inequalities in volunteering. The crucial
question is whether these inequalities are reinforced by new opportunities of online vol-
unteering or whether online volunteering is an opportunity to overcome inequalities by
mobilizing different people. Online volunteering can be defined as a "type of civic engage-
ment where the volunteers perform their tasks using the Internet either from their home or
other offsite locations" (Mukherjee, 2011: 253). Beyond this definition, no standard con-
ceptualization of online volunteering exists in the literature. Therefore, we draw on
Wilson's (2000) definition of volunteering saying that time should be given freely to ben-
efit others without receiving a direct reward. Accordingly, online volunteering includes a
Ackermann and Manatschal 5
variety of activities like administering the website of a club, moderating a Facebook
group, contributing to a Wikipedia entry, recording a non-commercial instructional
YouTube video, or engaging in Couchsurfing. Thus, the activity does not necessarily need
to be interactive and it might also include the provision of infrastructure, but the online
volunteer has to invest time and others have to benefit from it. Given the pioneering char-
acter of this study, we cannot draw on a standard theoretical framework to explain online
volunteering. Instead, we approach this question by comparing the nature of online and
offline volunteering and derive theoretical expectations about the determinants of online
volunteering therefrom.
Structural similarities between offline and online voluntary activities make a rein-
forcement of inequalities likely. For both kinds of activities, people need certain skills
and motivations. The sort of skills and motivations might depend more on the degree of
formalization than on the sphere where the activity takes place (offline or online). If a
person engages in formal volunteering, organizational skills, such as coordinating with
others and getting things done in time, might be necessary. For informal volunteering,
skills and motivations, like caring for others, are of higher importance. Giving private
mathematics tutoring to pupils in the neighborhood and explaining mathematical basics
to a broader public on YouTube might necessitate fairly similar skills and motivations.
Thus, the degree of formalization is expected to determine the required skills and moti-
vations. Online and offline volunteering, however, not only require certain skills, but
they also provide learning opportunities to enhance skills and self-efficacy. This aspect
will be especially interesting for those who have an instrumental perspective on volun-
teering and see it as an investment. Again, however, learning and qualification opportu-
nities might differ across activities (e.g. formal or informal volunteering) but less so
across spheres of volunteering (online or offline). Formal volunteering for an associa-
tion, for instance, especially if documented with a certificate, may be a more important
job qualification than informal engagement, regardless of whether this formal engage-
ment occurred online or offline. Given these similarities of online and offline volunteer-
ing in terms of requirements and benefits, we may expect that both spheres of volunteering
attract the same kind of people. Their engagement is supposed to be enabled by the same
type of resources, networks, and psychological motivations. In other words, higher edu-
cation, a higher overall socioeconomic status, social trust, religious norms and norms of
reciprocity, social networks, as well as higher age and potentially also being male would
increase the likelihood of becoming a volunteer in both spheres.
Taking a contrasting perspective, differences in the characteristics of online and offline
volunteering support the argument that online volunteering has the potential to mobilize
different kinds of people. For instance, offline volunteering is in general less flexible than
online volunteering. It usually takes place at a fixed point in time and is restricted to local
activities as well as to a limited variety of topics (Amichai-Hamburger, 2008: 554,
Cravens, 2000). These constraints can be easily overcome in online volunteering. On the
Internet, people can volunteer for whatever cause and whenever they want. What is more,
potential benefits of online volunteering can virtually extend all over the globe. The flex-
ibility of online volunteering may especially attract young people who are still in educa-
tion or at the start of their professional career. In this phase of life, which is often
characterized by mobility and rapid changes, flexibility in time and place becomes a key
6 new media & society 00(0)
factor for assuming a voluntary activity. Moreover, online volunteering may attract young
people particularly due to the variety of topics one can volunteer for on the Internet.
Finally, as "digital natives" (Hargittai, 2010), young people representing the "generation
Y" (born after 1980) and following generations are just more used to the Internet.
Especially, the use of social media and networks is more common among young people
and has the potential to strengthen their civic and political engagement (Skoric et al.,
2016; Xenos et al., 2014). Thus, we expect that the higher affiliation of young people to
the Internet should also facilitate their access to online volunteering. Whether accessibil-
ity is still higher among men than women and should therefore make men more likely to
volunteer online is debated in the literature. Recent findings still report a gender gap in
self-reported Internet skills, while actual knowledge and performance do not differ
between men and women (Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2010, 2015). We argue that self-
perceived skills will, however, be more crucial for the accessibility of online volunteering.
Individuals with low self-perceived skills will not feel well-equipped for volunteering
online. Thus, the accessibility of online volunteering should be higher for men. Beyond
flexibility and accessibility, online volunteering implies, in most cases, a higher degree of
anonymity (Amichai-Hamburger, 2008). At least for some online volunteering activities,
neither face-to-face contact with fellow volunteers nor direct contact with the addressees
is necessary (Rafaeli et al., 2009). Thus, the level of obligation and commitment should
be lower. This may imply a lower relevance of networks and psychological engagement.
In conclusion, these theoretical considerations result in two contrasting expectations,
as illustrated in Table 1. Given the structural similarities of online and offline volunteer-
ing, one can expect the same resources, networks, and motivations to be decisive (rein-
forcement). If this is the case, the overlap of online and offline volunteering should be
considerably large, implying that a high share of respondents should fall into the hybrid

category combining online and offline volunteering. Meanwhile, important differences
between the two spheres of volunteering fuel the expectation that online volunteering
will attract different people than offline volunteering (mobilization). Accordingly, the
overlap between the two forms of volunteering expressed by the hybrid category should
be relatively small. The two arguments oppose each other, but it is also highly plausible
that they are simultaneously at work. The similarities of offline and online volunteering
likely reinforce existing patterns of stratification, while the differences may help to over-
come them.
Data and research design
To test the theoretical expectations outlined above, our empirical analysis bases on the
latest wave of the Swiss Volunteering Survey conducted in 2014. Random sampling for
this survey was conducted by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office based on Swiss register
data and applying a three-stage stratification: Inhabitants of small cantons (strata 1),
young adults (strata 2), as well as immigrants (strata 3) have been oversampled.Amixed-
mode survey method was applied, where respondents could decide whether to answer the
questionnaire online (Computer-Assisted Web Interview [CAWI]) or by phone
(Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview [CATI]).2 As a result of these measures, impor-
tant sociodemographic and socioeconomic conditions of the Swiss population are well
represented in the survey (Reimann, 2015).
Our outcome of main interest is a nominal variable, which captures different types of
volunteering as well as non-volunteering. The variable comprises four categories:
offline-only volunteers, online-only volunteers, volunteers who combine their offline
engagement with online volunteering, and non-volunteers. Using a nominal variable
instead of dichotomous variables for the four categories enables us to neatly capture each
engagement profile and disentangle the dynamics between the different engagement
types. The category offline-only volunteers denotes individuals who engage in informal
and/or formal volunteering offline, and who do not volunteer online, using the following
two survey items:
We would now like to ask you about all the voluntary or honorary work you performed for any
associations, organizations, or public institutions over the past four weeks.3 Have you carried
out one or more activities of this type? (Offline volunteering, formal)
Did you perform another type of unpaid work beyond volunteering in associations or
organizations, such as transport aid, babysitting (children other than your own), neighborly-aid,
or supporting any kind of projects or events, etc. in the last four weeks? (The work has to be for
the benefit of people outside one's own household) (Offline volunteering, informal)
Conversely, the category online-only volunteers includes persons who volunteer exclu-
sively online, but not outside the Internet. Since online volunteering is a rather new phe-
nomenon, and to the best of our knowledge no established concept and measure available
yet, we developed a measure of online volunteering drawing on Wilson's (2000: 215)
notion of volunteering. The following exploratory question on online volunteering uses
several specific examples for unpaid beneficial, that is, voluntary, activities:
8 new media & society 00(0)
Apart from the already discussed forms of volunteering, the Internet provides manifold options
to volunteer online, meaning for unpaid work or engagement. I mention now several examples
of online volunteering. Please let me know for each example, whether you have already
volunteered online in this manner:
­ Host the website of an association or organization
­ Contribute to an entry on Wikipedia or open street map
­ Write an informative entry on a forum or blog, or a newsletter which is published online
­ Found and/or moderate a Facebook group
­ Publish how-to manuals/videos on Youtube or similar online platforms
­ Collaborate in open source projects (e.g. Linux, open office, etc.)
­ Offer online consultancy or expertise
­ Offer infrastructure online (e.g. Couchsurfing)
­Other(Online volunteering)
Individuals indicating at least one of the activities mentioned above are considered
online volunteers. The comprehensive category offline and online volunteers captures all
individuals who engage in at least one form of offline volunteering (i.e. formal, informal,
or both) and who also volunteer online. Non-volunteers, finally, who do neither volunteer
offline nor online, constitutes the baseline category of our empirical analysis. Table 2
illustrates the coding scheme.
As Figure 1 shows, the largest share of all respondents are offline volunteers, suggest-
ing that conventional real-life volunteering still represents the most widespread type of
engagement overall (40.3%). The fact that comprehensive, meaning online and offline
volunteers (17.9%), and not solely online volunteers (9.3%), represent the second largest
engagement group, may be a first sign that the two types of engagement are not, or at
least not entirely, mutually exclusive and may share certain commonalities. One-third of
all respondents do not volunteer at all (32.5%).

A look at the respective shares for different age groups (15­34
years, 35
years and
older) further reveals important generational differences. While the share of offline vol-
unteers exceeds the share of offline and online volunteers among older respondents by
three times, the difference almost disappears among younger respondents between 15
and 34years, who are often referred to as "generation Y," the first generation growing up
with the Internet (Hargittai, 2010). The pattern highlights the increasing relevance of the
Internet offering attractive volunteering opportunities for this young generation of "digi-
tal natives." In the empirical analysis, special attention shall be given to these pronounced
generational differences.
Our main explanatory variables include measures for sociodemographics, human
resources, recruitment, and psychological engagement. We integrate gender and age as
sociodemographic individual characteristics into the analysis. Age will also be crucial to
test our generation-based expectations. Human resources are captured by education as
one of the most powerful and consistent predictors of virtually all forms of volunteering.
Recruitment is measured by social networks, as well as religious affiliation and practice
in terms of churchgoing frequency, while psychological engagement is captured by gen-
eralized reciprocity and social trust. More detailed information on all variables, their
operationalization, and descriptive statistics can be found in Table OA1 in the Online
Appendix.
Methodologically, we use multinomial regression analyses in combination with
Heckman selection models. Multinomial regression analysis allows us to model the
nominal outcome of our dependent variable, whereas the selection model is necessary to

10 new media & society 00(0)
address non-randomness in our sample. More specifically, we account for the self-selec-
tion of Internet users, who are eligible for online volunteering, whereas non-Internet
users are not. To do so, we model Internet use on the first stage of our selection model,
calculate the inverted selection propensity (inverse Mills Ratio) of Internet use, and con-
trol for it in the second stage of our analysis, the multinomial outcome model.4 To fully
specify our first-stage selection model, we add the following variables: A dichotomous
variable indicating Internet use serves as the outcome variable on this first analytical
stage. Furthermore, and in addition to the explanatory factors mentioned above, we
include individual information on income and citizenship as independent variables in our
first-stage selection model. Canton fixed effects will be used to account for unobserved
cantonal heterogeneity. Running the models with cantonal controls for language region
and degree of urbanization--two well-documented factors influencing volunteering and
Internet use in Switzerland (Freitag et al., 2016; Kriesi and Baglioni, 2003; Stadelmann-
Steffen et al., 2010)--instead of the cantonal fixed effects produces very similar results.
Empirical results
The results of our multinomial Heckman regression models for different types of volun-
teering are presented in Table 4 in Appendix 1. Since coefficients from multinomial
logistic models can be difficult to interpret, we complement the main analyses reported
in Table 4 by post-estimation procedures. We focus on the average marginal effects to
discuss the results (Table 3). They facilitate a substantive interpretation of the profiles for
the four engagement types, allowing for a first assessment of whether the propensity for
online and hybrid (online and offline) volunteering can be read as a product of reinforce-
ment, mobilization, or both.
A glance at the results for the pure volunteering types, offline only and online only,
respectively, reveals clear differences between the resource profiles of volunteers engag-
ing exclusively in the two arenas. In line with our theoretical expectations, sociodemo-
graphics and human capital (resources), as well as social networks and religious
belonging and practice (recruitment), turn out to be distinctive factors characterizing
offline volunteers.
Changing, for instance, the gender of an otherwise identical individual from male to
female increases the likelihood to volunteer only offline by 12
percentage points.
Meanwhile, 10 additional years of age elevate the same probability by 4
percentage
points. An increase in educational attainment from primary to secondary or tertiary edu-
cation raises the probability to volunteer offline only by 10 and 9
percentage points,
respectively. Religious denomination and practice are further distinctive traits of offline
volunteers: frequent as opposed to no churchgoing raises the likelihood of mere offline
volunteering by 22
percentage points. Interestingly, pro-social values (psychological
engagement) do not affect the likelihood to volunteer only offline.
For individuals who volunteer only on the Internet, in turn, these resources do not
seem to matter much. In stark contrast to the pure offline category, most of the factors
that are distinctive for this group are irrelevant to characterize online-only volunteers.
Worth mentioning is the inverse gender pattern for online volunteering, which is in line
with our theoretical expectations: switching gender from male to female in otherwise
Ackermann and Manatschal 11
identical individuals decreases the probability to volunteer only online by 6percentage
points. Besides male gender, young age also increases the likelihood to volunteer online
only, respectively (minus 2percentage points for 10 additional years of age). The find-
ings confirm, thus, the picture of young people as "digital natives" (we return to the
question of generational differences in more detail below). Overall, the stark differences
in the profiles of the two exclusive volunteering groups reported in Table 3 suggest that
the decision to volunteer offline or online is driven by different factors. Yet, this is not the
whole story. Based on our theoretical argument outlined above, we would expect that if
the two arenas of volunteering attract very different people, there should be little overlap
between the profiles of online and offline volunteers (expectation of mobilization). As
Figure 1, however, showed, hybrid types combining offline and online volunteering are
rather popular: 18% of all respondents (and 24% of the 15­34years old) indicate a hybrid
engagement type, whereas, for instance, only 9% of all respondents volunteer online
only.
A look at the group combining online and offline volunteering in the third column in
Table 3 suggests that in this hybrid form of engagement the profiles of offliners and
onliners converge. Like offliners, volunteers pursuing offline and online activities are
typically endowed with more resources, for instance, in terms of education: changing
education from primary to tertiary increases the probability of a hybrid engagement by
7
percentage points. Recruitment via frequent churchgoing seems also to apply to this
hybrid category. Unlike for the offline-only profile, social trust becomes a significant
trait for the offline and online engagement type: a change from "you cannot be too

careful" to "most people can be trusted" increases the propensity to engage both, offline
and online, by 8percentage points. Overall, similarities with the offline-only category in
terms of resources and recruitment support the assumption that those who engage offline
would also engage online (reinforcement). The findings for age and gender, in turn, cor-
roborate our mobilization expectation, as they align with the pattern for the online-only
category. Switching from male to female decreases the likelihood to engage offline and
online by 6percentage points. The same decrease amounts to minus 3percentage points
for 10 additional years of age. The last columns in Table 3 finally illustrate the lack of
resources, recruitment, and psychological engagement among non-volunteers.
In the light of the pronounced generational differences revealed in Figure 1 and Table
3, we rerun the analyses for different age groups. Given their early socialization with the
Internet, the following analyses focus on the difference between representatives of the
generation Y, or digital natives (15­34years old), which are compared to older respond-
ents (35
years and more). The results of the respective multinomial Heckman selection
and outcome analyses are shown in Table OA2 in the Online Appendix. Similar to the
preceding analyses, the discussion of the results will focus on the average marginal effects
as they facilitate a substantive interpretation of the engagement profiles. To visualize dif-
ferences across generations, Figure 2 illustrates the average marginal effects graphically.
A look at the left graph in Figure 2 reveals that the resource-intense profile from the
CVM characterizing offline-only volunteers applies well to older respondents (35years
and older), whereas the variables of the CVM are less systematically related to offline
volunteering in the younger age group. To start with the similarities, switching from
primary to tertiary education increases the probability to volunteer only offline by 10
(young) and 18percentage points (old), respectively. The female overrepresentation does
also hold for both generations. Recruitment via social networks or religion (Protestantism
and churchgoing frequency) does, however, only explain offline volunteering propensity
among older respondents: changing from a socially isolated respondent of 35
years or
older to a socially connected individual of the same age, for instance, increases the prob-
ability to engage only offline by 32
percentage points. The same switch from socially
isolated to strongly connected individuals does, however, not alter the offline-only vol-
unteer propensity among 15- to 34-year-old respondents. Corroborating further the find-
ings reported in Table 3, the variables of the CVM are not able to explain online-only
volunteering, irrespective of the age group. The female underrepresentation in the online-
only engagement type holds for both groups, the 15­34years old as well as the 35years
and older.
Again, the CVM is most helpful to explain the hybrid (online and offline) engagement
among older respondents, although denominational factors are no longer a defining trait
of older volunteers in this group. Apart from the factor churchgoing frequency, which
increases offline and online engagement propensity among both, young (plus 26percent-
age points) and older respondents (plus 16percentage points), the variables of the CVM
do not contribute to the explanation of a hybrid engagement among young respondents.
The rightmost graph in Figure 2 finally confirms that non-volunteering relates to a lack
of resources, recruitment, and psychological engagement in both groups, younger and
older respondents.

Apossible source for concern are potential mode effects of CAWI (Internet) and CATI
(telephone) interviews. To account for potential mode effects (e.g. respondent selection
into a specific mode or response effects depending on survey mode) and, thus, to test the
robustness of our findings, we rerun the models reported in Table 3 separately for tele-
phone--and Internet respondents only (seeTables OA3 and OA4 in the OnlineAppendix).
The findings are very similar to the main results reported in Table 3, and there are no
signs of a systematic distortion of the findings due to survey mode.
Discussion
In this study, we set out to answer the question whether online volunteering is driven by
the same determinants as offline volunteering. Our aim was to evaluate whether inequali-
ties in social participation are reinforced in the virtual sphere or whether online volun-
teering can overcome them by means of mobilization. We addressed this question using
a data set providing, for the first time, insights on the extent of online volunteering based
on a comprehensive population survey carried out in 2014 in Switzerland. Following the
established CVM by Verba et al. (1995), we argued that offline volunteering requires
certain sociodemographic factors, human resources, recruitment through social net-
works, as well as psychological engagement. We discussed whether these factors may
also stratify volunteering online (reinforcement) or whether online volunteering attracts
and mobilizes different kinds of people (mobilization). Our findings support both ideas.
Online volunteering seems to reinforce existing patterns of inequality in volunteering,
but it has also the potential to mobilize and lure different kinds of people into social
participation.
To start with, we find that the CVM explains why individuals become offline volun-
teers. They have more social networks, are generally more trusting, have higher educa-
tion levels, and are more religious (in terms of denomination and practice). Our
differentiated analyses across age groups, however, reveal that this holds only for older
respondents (35years and more). The CVM is clearly less precise to capture the profile
of young offline-only volunteers between 15 and 34
years. One possible explanation
relates to the fact that they might still be in the process of acquiring the resources and
building up the social networks necessary for volunteering. Regarding psychological
engagement, it seems that young respondents are mobilized through different values than
the ones included in our model.
Conversely, the variables of the CVM are not related to pure online volunteering. We
observe this pattern in a similar way among younger and older respondents. From a theo-
retical perspective, we have argued that differences between online and offline volun-
teering suggest online volunteering will attract different kinds of people. The higher
degree of flexibility and anonymity on the Internet goes along with a lower degree of
commitment and obligation. This makes online volunteering a low-threshold activity, for
which no extensive resources, social networks, or a particularly pronounced psychologi-
cal engagement is necessary. Meanwhile, technical skills and a certain affinity for digital
technology are more important, which explains why young people as "digital natives"
are more eager to volunteer online. Also, a gender gap is still visible in this respect, with
men being more likely to volunteer online than women.
Ackermann and Manatschal 15
This support for the mobilization thesis among pure online volunteers is, however,
only part of the story. A look at the third category of volunteers who combine offline and
online volunteering reveals "hybrid" explanations. In other words, for the hybrid cate-
gory of offline and online volunteering, both mechanisms appear to be at work. On one
hand, there is evidence for the mechanism of reinforcement: the profile of the hybrid
category is more resource-intense than the one of pure onliners and resembles the profile
of pure offliners. Like in the category of pure offline volunteers, this resource pattern
can, however, only be observed for respondents who are 35years or older. On the other
hand, mobilization seems to occur since men and young respondents are more likely to
volunteer offline plus online. For the subset of young respondents, the gender effect is,
however, not significant.
To sum up, our findings suggest that both scenarios, reinforcement and mobiliza-
tion, apply for online volunteering. Reinforcement seems to occur among individuals
commanding the resources, networks for recruitment, and psychological engagement
of offline volunteers, who combine their activities with online volunteering (hybrid
type). At the same time, mobilization seems to be at work because online volunteering
seems to attract persons with other characteristics than the ones necessary for offline
volunteering. Our results are in line with studies on online political participation,
which show that reinforcement and mobilization take place (Vissers and Stolle, 2014)
and that especially young people are mobilized through online political participation
(Oser et al., 2013).
Further research is needed to complement the preliminary and exploratory findings
presented here on the nature and extent of online volunteering. To better understand this
new phenomenon, its relevance for voluntary engagement, and its impact on, and inter-
action with, conventional forms of offline volunteering, it is essential to collect addi-
tional data and to further develop the conceptualization and measurement of online
volunteering, ideally also in different social contexts. While we would expect that the
findings presented here are generalizable to other countries with high, but declining,
offline volunteering rates, such as Germany, the Netherlands, or the United States, addi-
tional research in different countries is required to test this assumption. Future research
should also tackle the question of measurement and carefully think about potential
improvements. It would, for instance, be important to indicate more clearly in the formal
and informal survey questions that the voluntary work takes place offline. Another limi-
tation of this study regards causality. Using cross-sectional data, our analyses cannot
prove causation. Nevertheless, our finding that pure offline and pure online volunteers
have very different individual profiles strongly suggests that mobilization of formerly
not engaged individuals is happening, and not mere conversion of former pure offliners
into pure onliners. However, quasi-experimental or panel studies are needed to prove this
causal expectation.
From a theoretical perspective, future studies should focus on the hybrid form of
engagement as well as on finding better explanations to account for the volunteering of
young people. Regarding the hybrid category, we had only cautious and exploratory
expectations concerning determinants and size of this category. Our finding that the two
theoretical explanations (reinforcement and mobilization) converge in this hybrid form
of engagement shall inspire future research and contribute to theory building regarding
16 new media & society 00(0)
the determinants of this comprehensive form of volunteering. Moreover, our results
demonstrate the limits of the CVM in explaining volunteering, especially for youngsters.
Putting a stronger emphasis on psychological underpinnings of volunteering, such as
personality traits or motivational aspects, might contribute to a more encompassing
understanding of volunteering online and offline. Since personality is related to Internet
usage (see Amichai-Hamburger and Hayat, 2013), psychological factors might also be
relevant to characterize online volunteers. Recent research on volunteering in general
(Ackermann, 2018), as well as more specific work on Wikipedia contributors, demon-
strates how personality can be accounted for in research on volunteering offline and/or
online (Amichai-Hamburger et al., 2008; Rafaeli and Ariel, 2008). In conclusion, more
research, empirical evidence, and theoretical reflection are needed to guarantee that our
understanding and conception of volunteering are not outdated, but moves with the
times. Our study is a first step in this direction and might be interpreted as a sign of hope
for those who worry about the future of volunteering in a digital world. Offline volun-
teers seem to be willing to combine their engagement with online volunteering. What is
more, online volunteering may even mobilize different people and thus remedy existing
inequalities in volunteering. Volunteering in a digital world might become more socially
equal because online volunteering is able to attract people with a profile different from
offline volunteers, especially in terms of resources and networks.

Notes
1. This also relates to the thesis of a "second-level digital divide" arguing that not only the access
to but also the use of the Internet are socially stratified (DiMaggio et al., 2004; Hargittai and
Hinnant, 2008).
2. The total response rate amounts to 20.2% (Reimann, 2015).
3. The list of possible associations in the Swiss Volunteering Survey 2014 comprises sports
clubs, cultural clubs, church or churchlike associations, interest groups, leisure organiza-
tions, charitable organizations, civil service, human rights and environmental organizations,
migrant associations, youth organizations, and political organizations. Thus, although this is
not made explicit, the context in which the question on offline volunteering is asked refers to
offline activities and engagement: it immediately follows the question whether respondents
Ackermann and Manatschal 17
are active or passive members in the aforementioned associations. An exception is of course
pure online organizations (e.g. moveon.org in the United States or 38 Degrees in the United
Kingdom) which imply online engagement. We thank one of the anonymous reviewers for
highlighting this possibility.
4. Because of our selection strategy, the outcome model is confined to Internet users, who
are, however, the vast majority in this survey (5023, or 88% of the non-weighted sample),
whereas only 697 respondents (meaning 12% of the non-weighted sample) indicate not using
the Internet.
