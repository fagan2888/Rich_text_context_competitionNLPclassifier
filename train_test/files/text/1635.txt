Objective: To investigate the prevalence of distinct com-
binations of components of the metabolic syndrome
among adolescents.
Design: A complex, multistage, stratified geographic area
design for collecting representative data from the non-
institutionalized US population.
Setting: The NHANES, an ongoing surveillance of the
nation's health conducted by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention.
Participants: Two thousand four hundred fifty-six His-
panic, white, and black adolescents aged 12 to 19 years
observed in the 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006
NHANES data releases.
Main Outcome Measures: Metabolic syndrome was
defined as having 3 or more disorders in the following
measurements: waist circumference, blood pressure, fast-
ing triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein serum choles-
terol, and glucose.
Results: About half of the participants had at least 1 dis-
ordered measurement, with an overall metabolic syn-
drome prevalence of 8.6% (95% confidence interval, 6.5%-
10.6%). Prevalence was higher in males (10.8%) than
females (6.1%), and in Hispanic (11.2%) and white (8.9%)
individuals than in black individuals (4.0%). In black fe-
males, there was a high prevalence of a large waist circum-
ference (23.3%), but no component of metabolic syn-
dromedominateditsdiagnosisinblackadolescentsofeither
sex. A large waist circumference and high fasting triglyc-
eride and low high-density lipoprotein serum cholesterol
concentrations were salient factors in Hispanic and white
adolescentsofbothsexes;highglucoseconcentrationswere
prominent among Hispanic and white males.
Conclusion: The low prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome in black adolescents, in parallel with uniformly
low prevalence of all 5 risk factors among those with meta-
bolic syndrome, portend ethnic disparities in the time table
for early onset of cardiometabolic disorders.

PREVALENCE TRENDS FOR OBE-
sity, type 2 diabetes melli-
tus, and other obesity-
related disorders in the
United States and many other
countries are disturbing.1 Obesity's role in
the series of concurrent cardiometabolic
changes that often precede more serious
cardiovascular disorders is being recog-
nized with increasing urgency. Obesity, es-
pecially abdominal and central adiposity,
as measured herein by waist circumfer-
ence (WC), is often linked to insulin re-
sistance and other diagnostic correlates of
metabolic syndrome: elevated triglycer-
ide concentrations, low high-density li-
poprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concen-
trations, elevated blood pressure (BP), and
elevated fasting glucose concentrations.
These 5 factors appear to be closely allied
with increased risk of developing type 2
diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular dis-
eases. When a person is found to have any
3 of the 5 component risk factors, con-
cern grows, warranting a diagnosis of meta-
bolic syndrome (MetS).2-5 Although con-
flicting opinions have been reported
concerning the diagnostic value of MetS,6,7
the concept provides a readily measured
set of criteria that could lead to more in-
tense clinical focus on the underlying
causes and thereby reinforces the utility
of lifestyle changes and perhaps addi-
tional clinical interventions.8 Our argu-
ment is that several cardiometabolic risk
factors within 1 individual, even at sub-
clinical levels that would trigger tradi-
tional treatment options, predict future
progression to overt chronic disease. Thus,
MetS may be a sentinel marker for high-
lighting the need for more aggressive in-
tervention efforts beyond the traditional
treatmentoptionsforoverweightandobese
youths.
According to recent estimates, MetS af-
fects, depending on the definition, 21% to

38.9% of the US adult population overall; the prevalence
in adults aged 20 to 29 years was found to be between 9.5%
and 19.6%.9 Many authors have reported adolescent preva-
lence data for MetS using numerous diagnostic crite-
ria.10-21 Although agreement is lacking on criteria for di-
agnosing MetS in adolescents, the diagnostic criteria
typically involve the same 5 risk factors identified in adults,
with modifications to the cut-off values for defining dis-
orders in specific components. The cut-off values give rise
to conflicting definitions and prevalences of MetS in ado-
lescents. Cook et al10,11 investigated 4 previously re-
ported definitions of adolescent MetS that included ap-
plication of adult cutoffs in addition to 3 sets of modified
cutoffs. These definitions led to disparate estimates, rang-
ing from 2.0% to 9.4%, for the prevalence of adolescent
MetS. As shown in Figure 1, other studies have also re-
ported instabilities in prevalence estimates as different di-
agnostic criteria are invoked.22
The cardiovascular risk related to MetS appears to travel
from childhood to young adulthood.23-25 A better under-
standing of the determinants of MetS during adolescence
mightprovideinsightsintopreventiveinterventionsforim-
proving health outcomes during adolescence and reduc-
ing the incidence of cardiovascular disease in adults. The
aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of dif-
ferentcombinationsofthe5componentriskfactorsforMetS
in search of the most influential diagnostic determinants
among adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in the United States.
A second objective was to determine differences in overall
prevalence of MetS in 6 sex-ethnicity subgroups.
METHODS
STUDY SAMPLE
The study sample was representative of the US adolescent popu-
lation aged 12 to 19 years. The data were obtained as part of
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES). The NHANES is an ongoing sample survey that
uses a complex, multistage, stratified geographic area design
for collecting nationally representative data from the nonin-
stitutionalized US population. Newly collected data are re-
leased in 2-year increments. The survey uses trained person-
nel to conduct home interviews for collecting reliable data that
include demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-
related information. Medical personnel obtain medical, den-
tal, and physiological measurements as well as results from labo-
ratory tests. A detailed description of these assessments has been
published previously.26
The study sample is composed of data pooled from 3 waves
of NHANES data that were collected during 2001-2006. Data
were retained for analysis of 2859 adolescents who had com-
plete data for all 5 component variables used to diagnose MetS.
In addition, adolescents were excluded if their ethnicity was
not Hispanic, white, or black (n=130); they did not have a value
for the sample weight (n=204); they were currently pregnant
(n=59); or they reported being previously diagnosed as hav-
ing diabetes or were currently taking medication classified as
a blood-glucose regulator, such as insulin (n=10). Thus, 403
adolescents did not meet the inclusion criteria, bringing the fi-
nal study sample size to 2456 males and females aged 12 to 19
years of Hispanic, white, or black ethnicity.
DATA FOR DIAGNOSING MetS
Participants were required to come to the mobile examina-
tion clinic before 9 AM after fasting for at least 9 hours. If
they arrived having fasted for less than 8.5 hours, they were
assigned a sampling weight equal to 0 as part of the
NHANES protocol. This reduced the sample size for our
analysis by 204 participants. Waist circumference was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 cm at minimal respiration at the end
of normal expiration with a steel measuring tape placed at
the high point of the iliac crest when the participant was in a
standing position. Diastolic and systolic BP measurements
were obtained using replicated measurements. After resting
quietly in a sitting position for 5 minutes and determination
of the maximum inflation level, up to 4 consecutive BP read-
ings were obtained with a mercury manometer. Mean values
of replicate systolic and diastolic measurements provided
estimates of current BP levels. Glucose concentration was
determined by a hexokinase method, triglyceride concentra-
tion was measured enzymatically using a series of coupled re-
actions, and HDL-C concentration was measured directly.26
Unfortunately, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion have issued an advisory regarding making inferences
from HDL-C data in 2003-2006 NHANES releases, warning
that specific measurements may be overestimated by a mean
of 3 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0259).
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR MetS
In this communication, adolescents were classified as having
MetS if they had any 3 of the following: a WC in the 90th per-
centile for their age and sex according to 1988-1994 NHANES
III data27; either systolic or diastolic BP in the 90th percentile
for their height, age, and sex as previously specified28; triglyc-
eride concentration of 110 mg/dL or greater (to convert to
millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113); HDL-C concentra-
tion of 40 mg/dL or less; and glucose concentration of 100
mg/dL or greater (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply
by 0.0555).29 These criteria are the same as those used by Ford

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All analyses were performed using procedures for sample sur-
vey data that are readily available in SAS, version 9.1 (SAS In-
stitute, Cary, North Carolina). Prevalence data were reported
for MetS and disorders (elevated or low measurements) in the
5 component variables used to classify adolescents with re-
spect to their MetS status. Estimates of the number of adoles-
cents in various subpopulations were also reported. Preva-
lence data expressed as a percentage with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs), weighted to be nationally representative, were
compiled for the overall sample, males and females, ethnicity
groups, and within sex-ethnicity subgroups. Ethnicity was cat-
egorized as Hispanic, white, or black. Overall and sex-specific
time trends were evaluated during the periods 2001-2002, 2003-
2004, and 2005-2006.
RESULTS
SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
There were 2456 adolescents in the study sample, which
represented a population of almost 29 million adoles-
cents (Table 1). Slightly more than half of the weighted
sample were males (51.6%); most were white (68%);
16.9% were Hispanic; and 15.1% were black. There were
11.2% to 13.1% in each age group (12-19 years).
PREVALENCE OF MetS
An estimated 8.6% of adolescents in the study had MetS
(95% CI, 6.5%-10.6%), which extrapolates to almost 2.5
million adolescents in the general population (Table 2).
The prevalence of MetS was highest in Hispanic males
(odds ratio [OR], 3.69; 95% CI, 2.05-6.65), followed by
white males (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.61-6.88), Hispanic fe-
males (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.20-5.54), white females (OR,
1.52; 95% CI, 0.75-3.09), and black females (OR, 1.09;
95% CI, 0.47-2.56) (white females were the reference).
Prevalence estimates throughout the 2-year period did
not reveal clear trends.
PREVALENCE OF
INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS
Overall, 19.1% (95% CI, 16.2%-22.0%) of the adolescents
had excess central adiposity (large WC). In black adoles-
cents,largeWCsweremoreprevalentinfemalesthanmales
(23.3% vs 11.9%). Among males, large WCs were more
prevalent in Hispanic (21.5%) and white (18.4%) adoles-
cents compared with black adolescents (11.9%). Almost 2
million adolescents (6.9%; 95% CI, 5.1%-8.6%) were cal-
culated to have elevated BP. Among males, the prevalence
of high BP was lower in Hispanic adolescents (4.9%) than
inblackadolescents(8.3%),whereasamongfemales,preva-
lence was lowest for white adolescents (6.4%). Overall, a
high triglyceride concentration was the most prevalent dis-
order (25.6%). The prevalence was significantly greater in
Hispanic (26.1%) and white (28.9%) adolescents than in
black adolescents (9.8%). Ethnicity prevalence differ-
ences in males were similar to those in females, corre-
sponding to overall disparities. About nineteen percent
(19.3%) of sampled adolescents had a low HDL-C concen-
tration; prevalence was significantly greater among males
(24.6%) than in females (13.7%) and in Hispanic (19.9%)
and white (21.1%) adolescents than in black adolescents
(10.6%). Ethnicity prevalence differences in males were
similar to overall disparities, whereas in females, the preva-
lencewaslowerbutethnicdisparitieswerewithintherange
of sampling variability. We estimated that more than 4 mil-
lion adolescents (14.0%) have an elevated glucose concen-
tration. Prevalence was greater among males than females
(19.8%vs7.9%)andinHispanic(15.2%)andwhite(14.8%)
compared with black (9.4%) adolescents. Ethnic differ-
ences within sex were similar to corresponding overall dis-
parities butwas significantonly inHispanic comparedwith
black males (22.4% vs 13.5%).
PREVALENCE OF
RISK FACTOR COMBINATIONS
About half of the adolescents had disorders for 1 or more
components of MetS, 42% had disorders for 1 or 2 com-
ponents, and 8.6% had 3 or more disorders. More males
than females had at least 1 disorder (55.5% vs 45.5%);
3.2% of males compared with 2.0% of females had 4 or
more disorders. Fewer adolescents were found to have
3 or more disorders in 2003-2004, in congruence with
the findings summarized in Table 3. This appears to be
a result of fewer males having 3 disordered components
and more males having 2 (pre-MetS) components in ad-
dition to fewer females having 3 and more having 0 dis-
ordered components in 2003-2004.
Prevalence estimates for distinct combinations of di-
agnostic components for MetS are presented in Table 3.
The prevalence of only 1 disordered component among
males was highest for high triglyceride concentration
(8.8%) followed by high glucose concentration (8.3%).
In females, it was highest for triglyceride concentration
(9.7%) followed by high WC (8.1%). The prevalence of

a distinct combination of 2 risk factors among males was
highest for high triglyceride and HDL-C concentrations
(4.9%) followed by high triglyceride and glucose con-
centrations (2.6%); in females, it was highest for high WC
and triglyceride concentration (3.8%) followed by high
triglyceride and low HDL-C concentrations (2.6%). The
highest prevalence for 3 distinct components was high
WC, high triglyceride concentration, and low HDL-C con-
centration for both males (3.7%) and females (2.1%).
Among the 10.8% of males with MetS, 34.3% had disor-
ders for WC, triglycerides, and HDL-C; in females, the
comparable value was 34.4%. An estimated 2.2% of males
vs 0.9% of females had simultaneous disorders for WC
and triglyceride, HDL-C, and glucose concentrations;
among those with MetS, this figure rises to 20.4% and
14.8% in males and females, respectively.
PREVALENCE OF INDIVIDUAL DISORDERS
IN ADOLESCENTS WITH MetS
With examination of the prevalence of individual com-
ponents of MetS in adolescents who have any distinct com-
bination of 3 or more components, it appears that el-
evated BP does not play a primary role in early onset of
this syndrome (Figure 2). Among Hispanic and white
adolescents, prevalence is prominent for disorders in WC,
triglycerides, and HDL-C, which seem to be the most in-
fluential contributors to the diagnosis of MetS in both
sexes, with glucose concentration having some degree
of importance in males. Although black females demon-
strated a moderately high prevalence of central adipos-
ity, a leading driver of MetS was not found in black ado-
lescents.
COMMENT
Our findings affirm others' conclusion that the preva-
lence of impaired biomarkers for early-onset metabolic
abnormalities represents a legitimate health concern. The
reported prevalence of MetS in adolescents living in the
United States has varied widely from study to study (10%-
21%). At least some of this variability is attributable to
the use of different criteria in defining MetS in adoles-

cents; certainly more consistency will be achieved once
the definition stabilizes. With use of the latest available
NHANES data (2001-2006), our estimated overall preva-
lence of 8.6% is in the upper tertile of estimates from other
studies (Figure 1). Overall prevalence was highest among
Hispanic adolescents (11.2%), followed by white (8.9%)
and black (4.0%) adolescents. In white adolescents, preva-
lence was significantly higher in males than females. There
are some indications in Figure 1 as well as in Table 2 that
prevalence of MetS in adolescents is increasing with time,
but the evidence is not conclusive.
Prevalence of central adiposity was lowest in black
males at 11.9%, but it exceeded 18.4% in all other sex-
ethnic groups. It was highest in Hispanic females (23.9%)
followed by black females (23.3%), Hispanic males
(21.5%), white females (18.6%), and white males (18.4%).
Prevalence of elevated triglyceride concentration was strik-
ingly high in Hispanic and white adolescents of both sexes
but relatively low in black adolescents. Low HDL-C was
highly prevalent in both sexes of Hispanic and white ado-
lescents compared with black adolescents. Prevalence of
elevated glucose concentration was high in Hispanic and
white males, intermediate in black males, and relatively
low in all females. Prevalence of elevated BP was mod-
erately low in all sex-ethnicity groups.
Among Hispanic and white males who met the crite-
ria for MetS, high WC, and high triglyceride and low
HDL-C concentrations were individually the most preva-
lent risk factors followed closely by high glucose con-
centration. Whereas prevalence of disordered WC, tri-
glyceride concentration, and HDL-C concentration was
also high in Hispanic females, disordered glucose con-

centration was not. However, prevalence of disordered
WC, triglyceride concentration, and HDL-C concentra-
tion was only moderately high in white females. Al-
though WC was slightly elevated in black adolescents,
none of the individual components of MetS stood out sig-
nificantly as determinants of the syndrome. Overall, BP
made only a minor contribution to MetS; this result is
consistent with results of a previous study in European,
African, and Cuban American adults aged 25 to 44 years
in whom insulin resistance, obesity, and lipid factors most
strongly represented MetS.30 We observed a low preva-
lence of MetS in black adolescents of both sexes, but preva-
lence of large WCs stood out only slightly in females, and
overall we did not find a pattern of WC or any other spe-
cific components driving the diagnosis of MetS.
Pediatric MetS has been reported to predict adult MetS
and type 2 diabetes mellitus.19 In adults, as in adoles-
cents, the epidemiology of MetS is unclear because the
diagnostic definition lacks consensus of scientific opin-
ions; hence, the implications of disparities among preva-
lence estimates have often been conflicting.9 We found
prevalence to be highest in Hispanic adolescents (males
higher than females) followed by white adolescents (males
significantly higher than females) and black adoles-
cents (males only slightly lower than females). This rela-
tively high prevalence of MetS in Hispanic and white ado-
lescents and the conflicting low prevalence in black
adolescents has been recently observed by others.10-12 Al-
though the low prevalence of MetS among black indi-
viduals during adolescence would be expected to trans-
late to a subsequent lower risk of developing
comorbidities, prevalence has been found to be high in
black compared with white adults for hypertension, dia-
betes, and cardiovascular disease.31 The prevalence of MetS
was found to be very high among adult black partici-
pants in the Jackson Heart Study; moreover, elevated BP,
large WC, and low HDL-C were each highly prevalent
among those with MetS.32
A natural hypothesis is that the sequence of events lead-
ing to definitive MetS begins with the development of obe-
sity and/or insulin resistance then continues by taking
many alternate pathways until metabolic irregularities
evolve into life-threatening diseases. We found that many
adolescents were not obese and yet had impairments in
1 or more of the following 4 components: BP, triglycer-
ides, HDL-C, and glucose (Table 3). That many adoles-
cents develop other metabolic disorders before they be-
come centrally obese suggests that there may be additional
origins of MetS. On the other hand, our definition of large
WC may be too conservative in relation to identifying
risk of metabolic disorder, so that overweight adoles-
cents who are below our cut-off point for central obe-
sity may be at risk for impaired triglyceride, HDL-C, and
glucose concentrations. Also, some adolescents may be
obese overall without being centrally obese. However, the
high correlation between body mass index and WC found
in our investigation as well as in a previous study (r=0.94
and r=0.93, respectively) does not support this hypoth-
esis.33 Using the 95th percentile for body mass index as
the threshold criterion for obesity, we found the overall
prevalence of MetS to be 8.3% (a value that is compa-
rable with the prevalence of high WC [8.6%]). Using body
mass index rather than WC as the criterion for deter-
mining obesity, we observed that the revised prevalence
was 12.5% (vs 12.9%) in male and 8.8% (vs 9.4%) in fe-
male Hispanic adolescents; 12.0% (vs 11.8%) in male and
5.1% (vs 5.8%) in female white adolescents; and 4.2%
(vs 3.9%) in male and 4.2% (vs 4.2%) in female black
adolescents. There is evidence that additional cardio-
metabolic risk due to obesity in adults is minimal once
the risk attributable to having an excessively large WC
is accounted for.34 Furthermore, poor cardiorespiratory
fitness may place many at metabolic risk,35 and fitness
may play a role even in those who are not obese.
The cross-sectional data in this NHANES study pro-
hibit a direct calculation of disease incidence and there-
fore we cannot make direct comparisons among sub-
groups regarding risk of developing MetS. Because specific
measurements of HDL-C may have been overestimated
in 2003-2006 NHANES releases and in light of the fact
that low concentrations of HDL-C are in the direction
of impairment, the prevalence data for HDL-C and MetS
may be underestimated in our analysis. The data also limit
our ability to investigate the time in which specific in-
dividuals develop disorders in the criteria used to clas-
sify adolescents with respect to MetS prevalence. Fur-
thermore, despite the large samples overall, sampling
variability becomes large and the stability of estimates is
compromised, as the sample sizes decrease when numer-
ous subgroups are investigated. As a result, some ob-
served differences among sex-ethnic subgroups may be
large, yet within the range of sampling variability and other
subgroup differences, such as those among sex-ethnic sub-
groups with respect to different component combina-
tions, were not investigated.
The American Heart Association recommends that
treatment options for childhood obesity be based on the
severity of obesity and the presence or absence of co-
morbidities.36 In the present study, 5.9% of the adoles-
cents had an elevated WC in the absence of other com-
ponent risk factors (Table 3). However, an additional 7.2%
of the adolescents had an elevated WC in the presence
of MetS. Of the 472 participants who had an elevated WC,
164 (35%) had other component risk factors to make the
diagnosis of MetS. Of the 25 study participants who had
MetS but did not have an elevated WC, 20 had an el-
evated glucose concentration as 1 of their 3 disorders,
whereas the other 5 had elevated BP and triglyceride con-
centrations and low HDL-C. Although each component
risk factor may be managed separately, it would be pru-
dent to identify those with multiple disorders, irrespec-
tive of obesity, and provide them with more aggressive
treatment and management options.
This work clearly identifies a different timetable and
perhaps a different pathway for developing MetS in black
adolescents. Although the prevalence of central adipos-
ity remained substantially lower in black males than in
other sex-ethnicity groups throughout adolescence, it was
very high in black females, but males and females both
had a relatively low prevalence of MetS. It is possible that
black individuals have a propensity for developing clus-
ters of component disorders later in adolescence and,
hence, demonstrate a lower prevalence of metabolic dis-
orders despite greater proclivity for cardiometabolic dis-

eases in early adulthood compared with Hispanic and
white individuals. The relatively low prevalence of all of
the individual components among black individuals, ex-
cept for the elevated prevalence of large WC in females,
is consistent with a delayed onset, but a complete expla-
nation of the ethnic disparities requires further study.
