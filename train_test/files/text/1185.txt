Background. Very few studies have examined how disability develops among older Mexican Americans. To de-
termine how disability develops, we explored the Disablement Process model, which posits that impairment, measured by
muscle strength, leads to functional limitations, which lead to disability, which ultimately is associated with health-related
quality of life (HRQOL).
Methods. A structural equation model approach was used (AMOS 4) with data collected on 622 Mexican Americans
aged 71 or older residing in the Southwest.
Results. Our results show preliminary support for the Disablement Process model. Impairment is significantly
associated with functional limitation (b ¼ .36, z value ¼ 7.2), which is significantly associated with disability (b ¼À.53,
z value ¼ 16.1). Finally, disability is significantly related to both physical and mental components of HRQOL (b ¼À.69,
z value ¼ 23.4; b ¼À.26, z value ¼ 6.5, respectively).
Conclusions. Muscle strength as a measure of impairment and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-
Form Health Survey (SF-36) score as a measure of HRQOL are important factors in understanding disability in older
Mexican Americans.
VERY few studies have examined how disability
develops among older Mexican Americans (1­5). For
a population that experiences relatively low mortality
despite low socioeconomic status, termed the Hispanic
Paradox (6,7), it is crucial to examine how factors that
influence mortality, such as disability, develop. Moreover,
disability is a very real public health issue. Approximately
20% of older adults in the United States have some type
of chronic disability, and almost one third have mobility
limitations (8). Medical care for a disabled older adult costs,
on average, three times more than care for a nondisabled
senior (9). As the percentage and numbers of older Mexican
Americans rapidly increases, the impact of their rising rates
of disability on health care is unknown.
Disability research among older adults has, until recently,
focused primarily on either non-Hispanic Whites or non-
Hispanic Blacks (e.g., 3­5). It is not clear how the
disablement process works in older Mexican-American
adults. However, research suggests that greater disability
and health disadvantages exist among Mexican Americans
relative to older Whites (e.g., 2,5,10). Also, previous research
indicates that older Mexican Americans have a higher
prevalence of certain health conditions (e.g., diabetes and
obesity) that have been associated with disability (4,10).
Moreover, studies that have focused on disability among
older Mexican Americans have typically estimated incident
or prevalent disability rather than the process of becoming
disabled or the outcomes from that process (10). Theoreti-
cally, the progression toward disability could be affected,
perhaps even delayed or halted, by multiple biological,
psychological, and social factors (1,2,11). However, to
determine whether the process of becoming disabled can be
influenced, it is important to first examine how disability
develops. Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate
how disability develops in older Mexican Americans. We
build on the Disablement Process model that we partially
tested in a previous study (2). The Disablement Process
model posits that impairments (which are abnormalities
at the physiological, anatomical, or mental level) lead to
functional limitations (limitations in basic physical and
mental actions), which then lead to disability (difficulty
doing everyday activities, problems with activities of daily
living [ADLs] or instrumental ADLs [IADLs]).
In this study, we will examine this model more thoroughly
than has been done in previous research in two ways: by
including not only components of the main pathway to
disability, but also a potential outcome from the process--
health-related quality of life (HRQOL); and by the additional
use of performance-based measures for the impairment
component of the Disablement Process model. Impairment
is an early part of the model and is meant to represent
physiological, anatomical, or mental abnormalities (11). We
focus on impairment through measuring muscle strength
with a Nicholas Manual Muscle Tester. Previous research
on the connection between muscle strength and disability
indicates that upper and lower extremity muscle strength is
strongly related to disability through their effects on mobility
(12). However, there has been no direct test of the role of
muscle strength in the Disablement Process model, nor have
the effects of muscle strength on disability been examined
among older Mexican Americans.
Therefore, our goal in this research is to begin to evaluate
the Disablement Process model by hypothesizing that: (a)
impairment (measured by muscle strength) will be positively

associated with functional limitations (measured by lower
body mobility); (b) functional limitations will be negatively
associated with disability; and (c) disability will be nega-
tively associated with HRQOL.
METHODS
Data Collection Procedures
The sample for the current study is a subsample from
the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic
Study of the Elderly (EPESE). The Hispanic EPESE is
a population-based study of 3050 noninstitutionalized
Mexican-American individuals aged 65 or older at baseline
(1993­94) from five southwestern states (Texas, California,
New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona). Four waves of data
have been collected (1993­94, 1995­96, 1998­99, and 2000­
01) [for details of sampling frame, please see reference (13)].
After Wave 3 data were collected, we created a list of
respondents who were alive at the end of Wave 3 (n ¼ 1979)
and who reported having Medicare coverage at either Wave 1
or Wave 2 (n ¼ 1598). From this group of respondents, 800
were randomly selected to be the sample for a substudy
focusing on the link between acculturation, disability, and
HRQOL. Of the 800 respondents selected, 622 subjects
completed the interviews. The remaining 179 respondents
included those who refused to participate and those who
completed proxy interviews. We did not include proxy
interviews due to the physical nature of some of the measure-
ments in the substudy. The respondents in the substudy were
aged 71 years or older (see descriptive information in Table 1).
Measures
HRQOL is assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study
(MOS) 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (14). The
SF-36 was designed to be a generic health-status measure,
and it addresses function in eight domains of health--
physical function, role physical (physical health), bodily
pain, general health, vitality, social function, role emotional
(emotional health), and mental health. The range is from
0 to 100 on each dimension; higher scores indicate better
HRQOL.
Disability is assessed by ADL and IADL limitations.
Respondents were asked if they needed help doing seven
ADL tasks taken from a modified version of the Katz
Activities of Daily Living scale, which include walking
across a small room, bathing, grooming, dressing, eating,
transferring from bed to chair, and toileting (15). If
respondents indicated that they needed help or were unable
to do a task, then they were scored as having an ADL
disability. For the IADL items, respondents were asked if
they were able to do 10 activities, based on the Older
American Resources and Services Instrument (OARS)
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (16) and the
Rosow­Breslau scale (17). These activities were using
a telephone, driving, shopping, preparing meals, performing
light housework, taking medications, handling money, doing
heavy housework, walking up and down stairs, and walking
half a mile. If respondents applied in the negative, they were
coded as having an IADL disability.
The final disability variable is hierarchical with three
levels. Scoring 0 indicates no ADL or IADL limitation; 1
indicates any IADL limitation (i.e., needing help with
instrumental activities such as shopping, taking medication,
or using transportation) or a mobility-related ADL limitation
(i.e., needing help walking across a room), and 2 indicates
a basic ADL limitation (i.e., needing help bathing or
toileting).
Functional limitation is addressed through lower body
limitations, which include assessment of balance and gait by
using items from the Performance Oriented Mobility
Assessment (18). These items include assessments of
standing balance, walking speed, and repeated chair stands.
First, standing balance includes side-by-side, semitandem,
tandem, and full-tandem standing. Respondents who were
able to hold the first stand for 10 seconds progressed to the
next stand and so on until the stands were completed. The
standing balance variable was coded from 0 to 4, with
0 reflecting no standing balance completed and 4 indicating
full-tandem standing for the full 10 seconds. Second,
walking across a small room (8-foot walk) was timed twice
to the nearest second, with the faster of the two walks used
for scoring purposes. Scores were divided into quartiles from
the sample ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 again reflecting walk
not completed and 1­4 indicating quartiles of the walk scores
with upper scores being faster times. Finally, scores for the
repeated chair stands were estimated to the nearest tenth of
a second among those who were capable of standing one time
from a sitting position with arms folded across their chest.
These scores were also divided into quartiles, with 0 reflect-
ing no chair stands completed and 1­4 reflecting quartiles
with higher scores reflecting better times. The total score
is created from a combination of these measures with
a range of 0­12, where higher scores indicate better
functioning (19).

DISABILITY AND OLDER MEXICAN AMERICANS
Impairment is measured through upper and lower body
extremity strength using a Nicholas Manual Muscle Tester
(NMMT), which is a handheld device for objectively
quantifying muscle strength. The peak strength (in kilo-
grams) required to break an isometric contraction is mea-
sured as the examiner applies force against the subject. The
NMMT is designed to be used with larger muscle groups of
the upper and lower extremities. A load cell in the device
provides digital output ranging from 0.0 to 199.9 kg
(equivalent to approximately 440 lb). The unit is placed be-
tween the examiner's hand and the limb being tested [for
details on the reliability and validity of the NMMT, see
reference (20)]. There were five positions tested: hip flexion,
hip abduction, knee extension, and two positions for shoulder
abduction. Higher scores indicate greater muscle strength.
The testing positions and reliability of the procedure have
been tested in older adults. Intraclass correlation coefficient
values for the five positions ranged from 0.76 to 0.98 (20).
Finally, we included four variables that could influence the
disablement process: age, sex, financial strain, and household
structure. Financial strain is a question that assesses how
much difficulty respondents have in meeting monthly
payments on bills; 1 indicates a great deal; 2 indicates some;
3 indicates a little; and 4 indicates none. Finally, household
structure is measured through household size, with a range
of 1­5 persons. (A few households had .5 people, but we
included these with the 5-person households.)
Statistical Analyses
To examine the Disablement Process model (shown in
Figure 1), we used structural equation models estimated with
AMOS 4.01 (Small Waters Corporation, Chicago, IL).
Structural equation models allow path analysis as depicted
in the Disablement Process model in Figure 1. Although the
Disablement Process model shows multiple pathways
influencing disability, the main pathway that we are
focusing on in this research is the pathway from impairment
to functional limitation to disability, and ultimately to
HRQOL (a ``global outcome''). This type of model has
been used previously (1) and is appropriate for the
examination of the patterns of inter-relationships among
components of the disablement process (2). Also, structural
equation models are useful for estimating factors, or latent
constructs.
Figure 2 shows the model that we estimated. We examine
impairment through five measures of muscle strength.
Structural equation models estimate both measurement com-
ponents and relationships between variables. Thus, Figure 2
(the estimates will be discussed below in the Results section)
shows that we are estimating: (a) the associations of our
control variables with impairment, functional limitations, and
disability; (b) the associations between impairment and
functional limitations and between functional limitations
and disability; and (c) the association between disability and
HRQOL.
RESULTS
Table 1 includes the descriptive statistics for the sample.
The average age of respondents in the sample is approxi-
mately 78 years, and the majority are female. The average
household size is slightly above 2, and the mean financial
strain falls between ``some'' problems meeting monthly
payments on bills and ``a little.'' Focusing on the disablement
process variables, we found that the sample appears to be
relatively nondisabled, with most of the sample falling into
the non-ADL or non-IADL disabled or IADL disabled and/or
mobility ADL disabled only. Also, the sample averages
around 7 on the performance-based lower body assessment
(12 is the highest score), indicating a medium level of
functioning.
Table 2 and Figure 2 show the results from the evaluation
of the Disablement Process model. First, as expected, the
main pathway is supported by the structural equation model.

strength, is strongly associated with functional limitations.
Those respondents with greater muscle strength have higher
lower body functioning (b ¼ .29), whereas those with better
lower body functioning have less disability (b ¼ À.53). In
addition, disability is strongly related to HRQOL. Respond-
ents with more disability have lower mental health and
physical health scores on the SF-36 (b ¼ À.26; b ¼ À.69,
respectively).
Focusing briefly on the control variables, we found that
household structure had no significant associations with any
components of the Disablement Process model. However,
age, sex, and financial strain were related to certain compo-
nents. Being older was associated with decreased muscle
strength, decreased lower body functioning, and increased
disability. Being female was related to decreased muscle
strength and increased disability, which was expected, but
female sex was counterintuitively associated with increased
lower body functioning. When we conducted an exploratory
analysis to examine why this was the case, the results sug-
gested that, when accounting for muscle strength in the
model, being female was no longer associated with disability
and was associated with better lower body functioning
(results not shown). Finally, having less financial strain was
associated with better muscle strength, better lower body
functioning, and less disability.
DISCUSSION
With increasing numbers of aging minorities, especially
a quickly growing group such as older Mexican Americans,
two lines of investigation that are important to the delivery
of services for older adults are the understanding how
disability develops and how disability influences other
health outcomes like HRQOL. Our goal in this research was
to address the Disablement Process model with the inclusion
of HRQOL as an outcome and through the inclusion of
muscle strength to measure impairment. The model that we
tested was supported by the data [the model fit was
reasonable, with the Normed Fit Index and Comparative
Fit Index . .95 and the Root Mean Square Error of
Approximation , .10; e.g., see references (21) and (22)],
indicating preliminary support for our hypotheses. The
Disablement Process model, which has received support for
non-Hispanic White samples, also appears to hold true for
older Mexican Americans. [0]Furthermore, muscle strength
plays a similarly important role in the disablement process
of both non-Hispanic Whites and older Mexican Americans.
Including the measurement of muscle strength as part of
the Disablement Process model is a contribution to disability
research. Investigation into the effects of muscle strength on
disability and into the process of becoming disabled among
older adults has been lacking in population research. With
more information on how muscle strength affects disability
in late life, exercise and strength-training interventions can
be designed to help older adults retain their functional
independence. It is also possible that a threshold for strength
could be developed to target older individuals who are at
greatest risk of becoming disabled (23).
Another contribution of this research is the connection of
Figure 2. Financial strain ¼ difficulty meeting monthly payments on bills: 1) a great deal, 2) some, 3) a little, or 4) none. Household structure ¼ number living in
the household (up to 5 persons). Impairment ¼ score on combined hip abduction, hip flexion, knee extension, and two shoulder-abduction scores (higher scores indi-
cate higher functioning). Functional limitation ¼ summary score on performance-based lower body function measures (higher scores indicate better functioning).
Disability: 0) none, 1) either limitation in mobility activity of daily living (ADL) or any instrumental ADL. For mental and physical SF-36, higher scores indicate
higher quality of life.

the disablement process to quality-of-life outcomes, such as
HRQOL. Authors of the original article conceptualizing the
disablement process argued that research into the disable-
ment process should not stop at disability as the final
outcome (11). Solely investigating the main pathway to
disability is insufficient. It is critical to examine what the
path to disability influences, including institutionalization,
mortality, and quality-of-life issues. We attempted in this
research to incorporate one outcome related to quality of life
in the Disablement Process model. The results of our
investigation suggest that disability is related strongly to
HRQOL and that the hypothesized model that conceptu-
alizes the disablement process with HRQOL as an outcome
is preliminarily supported by the data. Thus, more has been
done in this research to fully conceptualize the Disablement
Process model than has been done previously.
Although there are important contributions of this
investigation to research on disability, there are two primary
limitations that should be discussed. First, the generaliz-
ability of this research to older Mexican Americans is
limited. Although the subsample was randomly selected
from 10-year survivors of the original Hispanic EPESE
cohort, it is not representative of Mexican Americans aged
70 years or older. Second, the Disablement Process model is
intended to be examined as a process, and these analyses are
based on cross-sectional data, which are useful in establish-
ing relationships between variables. Support for the model
is somewhat limited until more data points can be used,
although, on the basis of previous research (2), we do not
expect the relationships to change.
Conclusion
Muscle strength is an important addition to expanding the
investigation of the Disablement Process model in older
Mexican Americans. Moreover, examining HRQOL in
relation to the process of becoming disabled is one way of
expanding the model of the disablement process to
investigate the influences of disability on other aspects of
life among older adults. As the proportion of minority older
adults increases in the United States, research that focuses
on how to keep minority elderly persons functionally
independent will be of increasing importance.
