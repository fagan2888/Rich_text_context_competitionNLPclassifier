Introduction
The Interreg MED Programme is part of the European
Territorial Cooperation (ETC) objective of the EU Regional
Policy. The main purpose of the programme is to contribute
to the long-term development of the Mediterranean area
and to strengthen transnational cooperation among peoples
of 57 regions in 10 different EU member states and 3 can-
didate countries (MED Programme, 2015a).
In 2013, the MED Programme launched its eighth and
last call for project proposals of the period 2007­2013.
The objective of this call was to facilitate an adequate
response to the maritime development priorities of the
Mediterranean by addressing several key challenges such
as `maritime innovation and economic development',
`environment protection', `transport and accessibility' and
`governance and policy response' (MED Programme,
2013). After evaluation process, 14 transnational projects
were approved being Bluene1 and Enercoast2 the two pro-
jects specifically tackling marine renewable energy (MRE)
and renewable energy in coastal areas. Selected projects
and beneficiary partners assumed not only the mission to
address key maritime challenges in the Mediterranean area
but also to set up the bases for the continuation of activities
over the period 2014­2020.
Concerning MRE,3 its theoretical potential for electric-
ity production is estimated from 20,000 to 80,000TWh rep-
resenting between 100% and 400% of the current global
demand of electricity (International Energy Agency (IEA),
2013). Besides its huge potential, other advantages attrib-
uted to MRE are as follows: contribution to energy inde-
pendency from indigenous resources, CO2
emission free
power, complement to other onshore renewable sources
(International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2014)
and employment creation, estimated in 20,000 jobs
MED Programme and transnational
cooperation contributions to marine
renewable energy in the Mediterranean
area: What next?

Abstract
The MED Programme is part of the EU Regional Policy and operates in the framework of the European Territorial
Cooperation objective. In 2014, the MED Programme approved 14 thematic projects specifically targeted on maritime
context with two of them addressing marine renewable energy and renewable energy in coastal areas: Bluene and
Enercoast. These projects aim at contributing to the deployment of marine renewable energy technologies in the
Mediterranean by gathering data, developing mapping activities, identifying policy gaps and addressing other obstacles
hindering transnational cooperation potential. The objective of this article is to analyse the delivered results and outputs
of these projects against the identified challenges and roadmap defined by the European Commission. Results were
evaluated under a transferability and continuation approach applied to the period 2014­2020. This article also identifies
and suggests ways in which transnational cooperation would enhance obtained results towards a higher implementation
of marine renewable energy in the Mediterranean.

throughout the supply chain of the marine energy sector by
2030 (Ocean Energy Europe, 2013).
In Europe, although MRE technologies are still in the
Research and Development (R&D) phase, wave and tidal
energy could provide up to 100
GW of installed capacity
by 2050 (European Commission (EC), 2014c). In terms of
resources, the Atlantic arc is the most favourable area for
ocean energy but the Mediterranean also counts on poten-
tial for MRE implementation (EC, 2014b).
Therefore, given the existing challenges and the magni-
tude of the untapped MRE potential, the aim of this article
is to analyse the contributions of ETC to the deployment of
MRE in the Mediterranean. For this purpose, the experi-
ence of the MED Programme throughout the Bluene and
Enercoast projects was studied by comparing their obtained
results against the defined EU roadmap and the actions
needed to overcome the existing burdens for MRE deploy-
ment in Mediterranean. The added value of this work lies
on a joint analysis of two different projects including their
results relevance and their continuation potential in the
programming period 2014­2020, as well as their useful-
ness for European policy decision-making.
Methodological framework
The methodological approach of this work is based on three
steps: first, identification of key challenges and roadmaps
for MRE deployment based on a thorough literature review;
second, an analysis of results achieved by Bluene and
Enercoast projects, as well as their potential to contribute to
overcome existing hurdles and thus stimulate the deploy-
ment of MRE in Mediterranean; and third, the identification
of links between results of analysed projects with current
European strategy of reference for blue energy. Finally,
based on the findings from these two evaluations, conclu-
sions suggest how European Transnational Cooperation can
enhance MRE implementation in the Mediterranean.
Key challenges, barriers and roadmap
for MRE
Compared to other forms of renewable energy, most of the
MRE potential remains untapped because of the various
barriers that persist. For this situation to change, there is a
need to better understand the complex hurdles to ocean
energy technology deployment and to engage interna-
tional community and various stakeholders to work
together aiming at enabling conditions to unleash its
potential. Accordingly, various institutions have done
remarkable efforts to identify and document what are the
most immediate barriers (technical, administrative and
regulatory), as well as required actions to overcome them
(see for instance policy priorities in IRENA (2014) and
IEA (2013)).
In the European Union context, the Directorate General
for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG MARE) has car-
ried out an impact assessment of policy options for MRE
deployment and identified as main challenges: (a) the need
to strengthening the EU's transmission grid infrastructure,
(b) high technology costs and difficult access to finance,
(c) integration of MRE in maritime spatial planning
(MSP), (d) simplifying licensing procedures, (e) better
exchange of information on the environmental impacts
and (f) assuring grant and revenue support (EC, 2014a).
DG MARE has also initiated an action plan in order to help
unblock the potential of ocean energy for the coming years
(see Table 1).
ETC as driver of blue energy in the
Mediterranean: the case of Bluene
and Enercoast projects
ETC is a key objective of the EU Cohesion Policy and
allows partners of different regions and countries to iden-
tify and implement good practices, develop joint
approaches and define methodologies around common
challenges in key issues such as among others, innovation,
governance and sustainable energy. Bluene and Enercoast
projects were co-financed by the ETC MED Programme
and addressed blue energy in the Mediterranean from dif-
ferent angles (see Table 2).
Both analysed projects delivered outputs which corre-
spond to the first phase of a classic ETC project: study-
ing.4 Therefore, the type of deliverables obtained by
Bluene and Enercoast correspond exclusively to processes
of gathering information and elaborating data necessary

to implement further and complementary actions. Within
the new architecture of the MED Programme for the
period 2014­2020, these complementary actions can be
concretised in the way of testing (e.g. pilot plants and
demonstration), capitalising (replication, transferability
and dissemination) and governance approaches (evidence
for policy improvement, higher investments triggered and
MSP) (MED Programme, 2015b).
Taking stock of progress: how to capitalise on
delivered outputs and achieved results?
Bluene and Enercoast projects achieved key results and
obtained relevant information necessary to support the
MRE use and promotion. Under a capitalisation approach,
future projects and initiatives addressing blue energy in
the Mediterranean should improve what was achieved or
to create new and innovative solutions based on already
acquired experiences.
Improving what exists could, for instance, imply enrich-
ing and/or keep feeding the obtained databases gathering
information on (a) MRE existent technologies; (b) interna-
tional conferences on research, policy and cooperation
issues; (c) legislation frameworks of reference; and (d)
existent projects already co-financed by European and
national funding.
New and innovative solutions may involve designing
strategies to address identified key priorities for MRE
deployment in Mediterranean (see Figure 1) such as
improving financing and developing knowledge on MSP
and integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) (Bluene
Project, 2015).

Maritime affairs and Fisheries is developing action plan
for stimulating deployment of blue energy. The plan is cur-
rently in its first phase with the implementation of the
ocean forum discussions which will support the design of
a blue energy roadmap expected for 2016.
As the forum is open to all type of stakeholders and
actors addressing blue energy, Enercoast and Bluene pro-
jects provide specific elements of analysis for MRE sup-
port in the Mediterranean sea. The key messages of both
projects are summarised as follows according to the three
established workstreams of reference.
Technology and resource workstream
Offshore wind industry is mature enough to expand in the
Mediterranean sea, like in Northern Europe. Current and
tidal turbines are also developed, but they are not suitable
for areas characterised by low current/tidal velocities
existent in the Mediterranean sea. As a very general
approach to the issue, the more favourable places for blue
energy investments are the gulfs of Lions in France, the
Messina straight in Italy and the coastal areas of Aegean
and Ionian seas.
The two most important actors to facilitate MRE
deployment in the Mediterranean are governments, and
industry and technology sectors. Governors should imple-
ment stable and reasonable legislation to guarantee appro-
priated frameworks as well as promote the efficient use of
available resources (human, technical and natural). At the
same time, industry and technology actors provide exper-
tise and enable testing process of new technologies adapted
to Mediterranean conditions. Actions from other actors
(e.g. research, non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
and media) can also play an important role in the progress
of blue energy projects.
Clusters are very appropriate vehicles for the promotion
of blue energy and increase of the competitiveness of the
involved industries. Moreover, synergies between public
and private actors should be established as a way to access
more stable funding opportunities. In addition, the differ-
ent analyses undertaken have shown serious gaps in rela-
tion to the potential of energy sources, the diffusion of
energy plants and the lack of cost-benefit analyses.
Administrative issues and finance workstream
In the Mediterranean, there exist several funding channels
to support research, technical and promotional activities
related to blue energy. In the period 2014­2020, several
EU programmes will allocate investments to promote
MRE through research and innovation (e.g. Horizon 2020
Programme), environment (LIFE Programme) and coop-
eration (Interreg Programmes). However, a key challenge
remains in the capitalisation of already co-financed initia-
tives so as to build upon existent results.
The renewable energy sector (onshore) provides legal
and administrative experience for the deployment of MRE
technologies. Lessons learnt should be integrated as key
reference in new blue paths for instance by adapting related
policies, integrating actors and discovering synergies from
a technical and administrative point of view.
The involvement of the private sector and of all other
involved stakeholders (local and regional institutions, gov-
ernments, universities and economic associations) is
essential to overcome the technical and non-technical bar-
riers that jeopardise the effective diffusion of MRE.
Environment workstream
MSP and ICZM should be addressed first as a way to
unblock MRE in the Mediterranean. The integration of
blue energy projects with other activities (aquaculture,
desalinisation and tourism) should be addressed within a
holistic approach. Blue energy chain needs to be further
analysed in order to design strategies to fulfil identified
gaps in the Mediterranean sea.
The definition of protocols, plans and laws for the
implementation and installation of blue energy projects
should be done according to available resources and in
coherence with the protection of the environment. The par-
ticular promotion of MRE on key territories such as islands
could imply additional benefits to local communities while
improving social acceptance.
Awareness raising activities, associated tools and com-
munication strategies should be improved to demonstrate
concrete benefits to several types of stakeholders ranging
from end-users to policy makers.
Adapted roadmap for the Mediterranean
driven by cooperation
The analysed state of the art of MRE in the Mediterranean
area indicates substantial differences with respect to devel-
opments and characteristics of other European seas (e.g.
Atlantic and Baltic). Accordingly, European policies
addressing blue energy should consider specific regional
challenges in order to effectively facilitate MRE support.
The Transnational MED Programme through Bluene
and Enercoast projects has identified key action lines to
overcome barriers for blue energy projects in coming
years. These action lines represent the common vision of
stakeholders engaged in related cooperation processes and
therefore should be considered in the design of future blue
strategies adapted for the Mediterranean:
·
· Identification of suitable locations for new blue
energy technologies;
·
· Clusterisation and creation of value chains;
·
· Elaboration of MSP and ICZM;
·
· Efficient transmission of the energy produced;
Gomez Prieto and Caldes 99
·
· Increase health and safety of blue energy projects;
·
· Improve financing for the development of blue
energy projects;
·
· Develop zones for testing technologies;
·
· Assessment of environmental impacts and effects
of blue energy technologies.
Conclusion
ETC is a strategic instrument of the EU Cohesion Policy
able to address regional challenges such as the deployment
of MRE in the Mediterranean. The MED Programme pro-
jects Bluene and Enercoast have delivered useful outputs
highlighting the barriers and priorities to be addressed and
suggested key cooperation frameworks to give continuity
to what has been achieved.
The capitalisation approach and new projects' architec-
ture developed by the MED Programme will facilitate the
continuation of further steps towards supplementary
phases (e.g. testing) over the period 2014­2020. Moreover,
synergies are also possible (and expected) with other ini-
tiatives, projects and funding channels of reference in the
Mediterranean identified by analysed projects.
Projects' results were obtained in a crucial moment
where EU strategy on blue energy is being built.
Accordingly, ETC results can be used as significant input
for policy-making process not only at sub-national,
national or regional level but also at European scale.
Nevertheless, an adapted MRE roadmap for the
Mediterranean should include ETC as a driving force able
to compile and share visions of several actors, as well as a
way to enhance political and industry coordination.
