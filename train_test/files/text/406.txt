OBJECTIVE -- Performance measures are tools for assessing quality of care but may be
influenced by patient factors. We investigated how currently endorsed performance measures for
glycemic control in diabetes may be influenced by case mix composition. We assessed differ-
ences in A1C performance measure threshold attainment by case mix factors for A1C 9% and
examined how lowering the threshold to A1C 8% or 7% changed these differences.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Using data from the 1999­2002 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 843 adults self-reporting diabetes, we computed
the mean difference in A1C threshold attainment of 9, 8, and 7% by various case mix
factors. The mean difference is the average percentage point difference in threshold attainment
for population groups compared with that for the overall population.
RESULTS -- Diabetes medication was the only factor for which the difference in threshold
attainment increased at lower thresholds, with mean differences of 5.7 percentage points at A1C
9% (reference), 10.1 percentage points at A1C 8% (P  0.05), and 14.1 percentage points
at A1C 7% (P  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS -- As 87% of U.S. adults have A1C 9%, a performance measure thresh-
old of 9% will not drive major improvements in glycemic control. Lower thresholds do not
exacerbate differences in threshold attainment for most factors. Reporting by diabetes medica-
tion use may compensate for heterogeneous case mix when a performance measure threshold of
A1C 8% or lower is used.

The implementation of performance
measures to provide public account-
ability and financial incentive for
quality health care represents a major
shift in the approach to improving popu-
lation health within the U.S (1). The
movement to measure quality diabetes
care involves establishing standards re-
lated to glycemic control, eye and foot ex-
aminations, urine protein screening, and
management of lipids and blood pressure
(2). The performance measure threshold
for glycemic control has been controver-
sial. More stringent measures may en-
courage overzealous treatment of
individuals to which more general guide-
lines do not apply. Conversely, providers
may mistake less stringent performance
measures for guidelines that have been
carefully developed by a number of med-
ical organizations to assist physicians in
setting therapeutic targets for their pa-
tients (3).
The most commonly cited guidelines
are those of the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation (ADA), which state that although
certain patient groups (e.g., elderly pa-
tients or those with comorbidity) may not
benefit from stringent glycemic targets,
maintaining A1C 7% is a reasonable
goal for individuals with diabetes (4). Af-
ter decades in which less than half of
Americans reached the target of A1C
7% (5), national data have shown im-
proved glycemic control in those with di-
abetes with 56% achieving A1C 7% in
2003­2004 (6,7). Even before these im-
provements, some stakeholders ques-
tioned whether linking pay for
performance programs to a 9% thresh-
old would encourage adequate glycemic
control for individual patients or propel
declines in A1C at the national level (8).
With only 13% of Americans with diag-
nosed diabetes having a A1C of 9% in
2003­2004, a performance measure of
9% may have limited ability to drive
population-wide quality improvement.
In contrast to clinical practice guide-
lines for glycemic control, such as the
ADA guideline, which address goals for
individual patients, performance mea-
sures are designed to indicate overall
health care quality delivered across a pop-
ulation of patients (9). An A1C perfor-
mance measure for holding providers
accountable may foster improvement in
population-level glycemic control, al-
though experts debate how to define an
optimal measure of health care quality
(10,11). This debate has led to different
thresholds established by different orga-
nizations and used for different purposes.
The National Diabetes Quality Improve-
ment Alliance (NDQIA), a consortium of
stakeholders interested in diabetes care,
has established two categories of perfor-
mance measures. The first category of
measures is intended for quality improve-
ment efforts within an organization and
describes A1C values across the range of
6.0 to 10.0%. The second set of mea-
sures is that to which providers and
health plans will be accountable for pub-
lic reporting and on which performance-
based reimbursements will be based. The
glycemic control performance measure
that the NDQIA recommends for public
reporting is A1C 9% to indicate poor
control (12). The NDQIA has a good con-
trol measure of A1C 7% under "active
consideration" but stated that "before
such a measure can be put forward, ap-
propriate means for considering case mix
must be specified." The National Quality
Forum (NQF), whose mission is to im-
prove health care quality through na-
tional performance standards, has

adopted the NDQIA benchmarks, includ-
ing the A1C 9% threshold for public
reporting. In contrast, the National Com-
mittee for Quality Assurance adopted a
Health Plan Employer Data and Informa-
tion Set measure of A1C 7% for public
accountability (13). This measure has un-
dergone scrutiny (10,11) because not all
patients should achieve this goal. Clinical
guidelines state that individual goals are
to be tailored according to age, life expect-
ancy, comorbidity, risk of hypoglycemia,
and patient preferences (4).
Part of the challenge of implementing
an A1C performance measure is prevent-
ing unintended consequences, such as
penalizing physicians who treat low-
income patients or patients with medi-
cally complicated diabetes in whom A1C
may be more difficult to control. In its
rationale for the 9% threshold, the
NDQIA stated that [performance] mea-
sures "must account for differences in in-
dividual patient conditions and
preferences." This wording suggests that
the NDQIA is adopting a lenient thresh-
old to diminish differences in threshold
attainment that are due to heterogeneity
in case mix.
Differences in glycemic control across
age, BMI, duration of diabetes, and diabe-
tes medication use (6,14) indicate that
these case mix factors are likely to influ-
ence performance measure attainment.
Differences in glycemic control by race/
ethnicity have also been reported (15) but
may be a function of access to care (16).
Education and income level may influ-
ence measures of diabetes care indepen-
dent of access to care (16). Determining
the effect of threshold choice on the mag-
nitude of case mix factor differences is im-
portant for the careful selection of a
performance measure. Using representa-
tive data from individuals with diabetes in
the U.S. and considering A1C thresholds
of 9, 8, and 7%, we computed esti-
mates of differences in threshold attain-
ment for various patient factors and
determined how the magnitude of differ-
ences is affected by choice of threshold.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data for this cross-
sectional analysis come from the 1999­
2002 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). This on-
going survey conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics uses a strati-
fied, multistage, probability cluster de-
sign that results in a nationally
representative sample of the noninstitu-
tionalized, civilian U.S. population. The
sampling design oversamples non-
Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, in-
dividuals aged 60 years, and low-
income individuals to provide more
precise estimates for these specific
groups. We included 843 adults aged
20 years with valid measures of A1C
who were not pregnant and who reported
during an interview that a health care
professional had told them they have di-
abetes. The NHANES 1999­2002 under-
went institutional review board approval,
and written informed consent was ob-
tained from participants.
Measures
Sociodemographic characteristics and in-
formation on diabetes, health, and insur-
ance status were ascertained during
interviews. Age-groups were based on ap-
proximate quintiles of the analytic sam-
ple. Race/ethnicity was based on self-
identified race and Hispanic origin.
Income-to-poverty ratio was defined as
the ratio of reported total family income
to the U.S. Census Bureau poverty
threshold. Diabetes medication was cat-
egorized as use of insulin (with or with-
out oral agents), use of oral agents only,
and no use.
Weight and height were measured
during a physical examination. BMI was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters, and
weight status was categorized as under-
weight or normal weight, overweight,
obese, and severely obese with BMI cut
points of 25, 2529.9, 30­39.9, and
40 kg/m2 (17). A1C was assessed by
boronate affinity high-performance liquid
chromatography using Primus CLC330
and Primus CLC 385 (Primus, Kansas
City, MO), and values were standardized
according to the method of the Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial (18,19),
yielding interassay coefficients of varia-
tion of 3.0%.
Data analysis
The mean difference provides a measure
of disparity among different groups
within a population (20). We used the
mean difference to assess differences in
A1C threshold attainment by various
population groups within potential case
mix factors. For each factor, we calculated
a mean difference to provide a summary
of the difference in proportion of people
with diabetes whose A1C was 7, 8,
and 9%. The mean difference is ex-
pressed in percentage points, across any
number, p, of population groups. The ref-
erent for each threshold, rref
, was selected
as the proportion exceeding the threshold
among the overall population. These ref-
erent proportions are constant at a given
threshold and provide an intuitive stan-
dard from which to gauge differences
across groups. For each population
group, j, we calculated the proportion, rj
,
exceeding the threshold, and the absolute
difference in that proportion from that of
the referent, rref
. For each factor, the mean
difference was calculated using Equation 1.

All calculations were made with Wes-
var (version 5; Westat, Rockville, MD) us-
ing the 4-year examination sample
weights to account for the sample design
and nonresponse. Sampling variance was
calculated using the jackknife procedure,
appropriate for the complex, multistage
sample design (21), and 95% confidence
limits were calculated by taking the natu-
ral logarithm of the mean difference, esti-
mating the standard error of the
transformed estimate, deriving confi-
dence limits, and back-transforming the
confidence limits via exponentiation.
This transformation results in asymmetric
confidence limits but improves their va-
lidity (22). Student's t tests were used to
test whether the differences between the
mean differences for the 7 and 8% thresh-
olds relative to the 9% threshold were
equal to 0.
RESULTS -- The proportion of indi-
viduals whose A1C concentrations were
9, 8, and 7% are presented by var-
ious patient factors (Table 1). Frequency
distributions for each factor across the
overall population are provided for refer-
ence. Of the overall (unstratified) popula-
tion, 18.4% exceeded an A1C threshold
of 9%, 32.8% exceeded an A1C threshold
of 8%, and 52.6% exceeded the ADA rec-
ommended target A1C of 7%. These pro-
portions provide the referent to which
subgroup threshold attainment is com-
pared. We first present differences in
threshold attainment within factors and
then describe the effects of lowering the
A1C threshold on these differences.

race/ethnicity, and insurance status at
each of the A1C thresholds, whereas dif-
ferences across sex and education were
minor. The proportion with A1C 9%
declined steadily with increasing age,
such that 32.7% of those aged 20­44
years but only 13.4% of those aged
65­74 years and only 5.8% of those
aged 75 years surpassed the thresh-
old. The age gradient was not explained
by a shorter reported duration of diabetes
or a lower proportion of insulin use
among elderly individuals (data not
shown). In comparing each of the five
age-groups to the overall population, the
mean difference in the proportion with
A1C 9% was 7.8 (95% confidence lim-
its 4.4­13.9) percentage points. The dif-
ference across race/ethnic groups was of a
magnitude similar to that for the age dif-
ference at this threshold. Among race/
ethnic groups, the proportion exceeding
any threshold was much lower for non-
Hispanic whites than for any minority
race/ethnic group. Almost one-third of
those most economically disadvantaged
(income-to-poverty ratio 0.8) had A1C
9%, but the proportions of individuals
in the other income-to-poverty ratio cat-
egories with A1C 9% were much lower
and ranged from 14.9 to 17.5%, resulting
in a mean difference of 5.4 (3.0­9.8) per-
centage points. Uninsured individuals
were more likely to have A1C 9% than
those with any insurance. The lower pro-
portion with A1C 9% among those with
public insurance (and among those with
additional private insurance) appears to
be explained by the Medicare eligibility of
individuals aged 65 years, who have a
lower probability of poor control (data
not shown).
Lowering the threshold to A1C 8 or
7% did not significantly affect most so-
ciodemographic disparities. The age gra-
dient persisted, and mean differences
across age and insurance status were
modestly reduced as the threshold was
lowered from 9 to 7%. Mean differ-
ences across race/ethnic groups at the
lower thresholds remained substantial.
Lowering the threshold to A1C 8% did
not significantly reduce the disparity
across income-to-poverty groups, but
lowering the threshold to A1C 7% re-
duced the mean difference to 2.5 (95%
confidence limits 0.7­9.0) percentage
points, a significant decline from the esti-
mate at 9% (P  0.05). Although our
analysis was framed in terms of the effect
on the mean difference across various
groups of lowering the threshold for poor
control, the results are similar if framed in
terms of raising the A1C threshold for
good control.
Health status factors
Among health status factors, the largest
difference at the 9% threshold was
found across diabetes medication catego-
ries. Compared with 18.4% overall, more
than one-quarter of individuals taking in-
sulin, 16% of those taking oral medica-
tions, and 13% of those using no
medications had concentrations above
this level, yielding a mean difference of
5.7 (95% confidence limits 2.3­13.8)
percentage points. The relation of poor
glycemic control by diabetes duration was
U-shaped, as a lower proportion among
those with duration of diabetes 5 and at
least 20 years had A1C 9%; the mean
difference was 4.9 (2.2­11.1) percentage
points. The mean difference for weight
status was small at 3.3 (1.0­11.3) per-
centage points. Only 9.8% of individuals
who reported good or excellent health

had A1C 9%, whereas 20% of those re-
porting good or fair to poor health had
concentrations above the threshold,
yielding a mean difference of 4.2 (2.0­
9.1) percentage points for self-reported
health. At A1C 9%, mean differences
across categories of number of prescrip-
tion medications and number of health
care interactions and hospitalization in
the last year were small, at 3.1 (0.8­11.9),
4.1 (1.5­11.1), and 2.1 (0.1­34.5) per-
centage points, respectively.
Lowering the threshold to A1C 8 or
7% had a large and significant effect on
the mean difference across categories of di-
abetes medication. Compared with 32.8%
of the overall population, nearly half of
those who used insulin had A1C 8%, and
compared with 52.6% overall, 70% of in-
sulin users had A1C 7%. Mean differ-
ences were 10.1 (95% confidence limits
6.5­15.7) percentage points at A1C 8%
and 14.7 (10.8­20.1) percentage points at
A1C 7% (P  0.05 and P  0.001, re-
spectively, compared with A1C 9%). The
increase in the mean difference for diabetes
medication categories at sequentially lower
A1C thresholds reflects a differential in-
crease by type of medication in the propor-
tionexceedingthelowerthresholds(Fig.1).
When the threshold is lowered to A1C
8%, the proportion of insulin users ex-
ceeding the threshold increased by 20 per-
centage points (to include those with A1C
8­9%), compared with increases of 13
and 9 percentage points for those taking
oral agents and those not using medication,
respectively.Whenthethresholdislowered
toA1C7%,theincreaseintheproportion
above this threshold was 23 percentage
points for the insulin users and those taking
oral agents (after including those with A1C
7­8%), but only 6 percentage points for
those using no medication. The mean dif-
ferences for the remaining health status fac-
tors were not significantly affected by
lowering the A1C to 8 or 7%.
In Table 2, patient factors were ranked
by mean differences at each A1C threshold.
Considering a mean difference of 5 per-
centage points as noteworthy, important
disparities were consistently observed
acrossallthreeA1Cthresholdsforage,race/
ethnicity, insurance, and diabetes medica-
tion, but their rank varied by threshold. At
A1C 9%, insurance, age, and race/
ethnicity contributed the greatest mean
differences in threshold attainment. At
lower thresholds, diabetes medication ex-
hibited the greatest disparity with mean dif-
ferences of 10 and almost 15 percentage
points. The average mean difference across
all factors was consistent (4.7­4.8) among
all thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS -- This study dem-
onstrates the extent to which disparities
in glycemic control by patient subgroups
are mitigated or exacerbated by choice of
A1C thresholds of 9, 8, and 7%. For
11 of the 13 factors examined, choice of
A1C threshold did not significantly affect
the magnitude of population subgroup

differences in glycemic control. For ex-
ample, we observed pronounced race/
ethnicity differences in achievement of
glycemic control at all three thresholds,
a finding consistent with previous re-
search (23). We found no evidence,
however, that establishing a lower A1C
cutoff as a performance measure would
exacerbate this disparity or that select-
ing a less stringent threshold would ob-
viate the disparity.
Diabetes medication is the major pa-
tient factor for which differences in
threshold attainment would be exacer-
bated by lowering the current NDQIA
and NQF glycemic control performance
measure of A1C 9%. The importance of
diabetes treatment for good (A1C 7%)
glycemic control has been shown to be
independent of sociodemographic char-
acteristics, abdominal obesity, and health
care access and utilization (15). The mag-
nitude of this difference at the lower
thresholds has implications for pay for
performance quality improvement mod-
els being considered by the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services and other
payers. Practices that include a greater
proportion of patients receiving insulin
may have proportionately more patients
exceeding A1C thresholds. A quality im-
provement system that includes an incen-
tive to achieve a performance measure for
glycemic control may not recognize ap-
propriate care given by physicians whose
practice includes a larger proportion of
people needing insulin for glycemic con-
trol, unless the system accounts for this
factor. Reporting performance measure
attainment specific to diabetes medica-
tion use, and insulin use in particular,
might be one means to account for this
difference in case mix, although imple-
menting this recommendation may not
currently be practical under most sys-
tems. As health systems move forward
with electronic medical records, however,
capturing information on medication use
will be more feasible. Although auto-
mated review of electronic medical
records may not consistently capture data
on prescription medications (24), perfor-
mance measures stratified by prescription
medication may be a viable solution as
long as measures receive adequate field
testing (25).
Differences across other patient
health factors examined (self-reported
health, number of prescription medica-
tions taken, and history of hospitaliza-
tion) were not greatly influenced by the
choice of glycemic control performance
measure threshold. Of the 13 factors
studied, only socioeconomic status (as
measured by the income-to-poverty ratio)
had a reduced disparity in threshold at-
tainment with a lower A1C threshold.
We observed a sizable difference in
threshold attainment by age, with im-
proved glycemic control across increasing
age-groups. The effect may be one of sur-
vivorship bias whereby life-threatening
complications are reduced among indi-
viduals with well-controlled diabetes or
may reflect milder disease with more
-cell function in elderly individuals. The
poorer control in younger patients is om-
inous as they will have a longer duration
of diabetes and thus greater risk of com-
plications. Our findings also suggest that
the current NDQIA and NQF perfor-
mance measure of A1C 9% is unlikely
to drive major improvements in glycemic
control in the Medicare population as
only 13.4% of those aged 65­74 and
5.8% of those aged 75 had A1C 9%.
Our analysis of these national data of-
fers a response to a specific health policy
question being debated among groups
committed to establishing national health
care quality measures. Nonetheless, we
acknowledge several limitations. Recent
evidence suggests that differences in A1C
by race may reflect physiological differ-
ences such as rates of glycation and eryth-
rocyte survival (26). Fair implementation
of threshold-based performance mea-
sures will depend on determining
whether small differences in A1C thresh-
old attainment truly indicate differences
in quality diabetes care after adjustment
for case mix. Diagnosed diabetes status
was assessed with a validated question
that nonetheless has a sensitivity of
81% and a positive predictive value of
89% (27). Another limitation is that our
analysis relied heavily on self-reported
case mix factors. The NHANES surveys
are designed to result in a representative
sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.
population but may underrepresent non-
institutionalized persons with mental
health and substance abuse conditions, a
group shown to have poor glycemic con-
trol (28).
We conclude that implementing an
A1C performance measure to indicate
poor control that is more stringent than
the current measure of A1C 9% would
not increase disparities across most pa-
tient factors including age, race/ethnic
group, and socioeconomic status. To ac-
count for a case mix that includes more
insulin users, however, stakeholders con-
sidering the selection of a performance
measure threshold for glycemic control
that is 8% should consider reporting of
threshold attainment specific to diabetes
medication use. Stratified reporting
would allow more rigorous goals for gly-
cemic therapy in groups for whom a ben-
efit has been established. In so doing,
lowering the A1C performance measure
threshold may advance the overall quality
of diabetes care, without magnifying
overall differences among population
groups and without discouraging physi-
cian acceptance of insulin-requiring pa-
tients whose diabetes is more difficult to
manage.
