Abstract
The importance of antioxidants in reducing risks of chronic diseases has been well established; however, antioxidant
intakes by a free-living population have not yet been estimated adequately. In this study, we aimed to estimate total
antioxidant intakes from diets and supplement sources in the U.S. population. The USDA Flavonoid Database, food
consumption data, and dietary supplement use data of 8809 U.S. adults aged $19 y in NHANES 1999­2000 and 2001­2002
were used in this study. Daily total antioxidant intake was 208 mg vitamin C (46 and 54% from diets and supplements,
respectively), 20 mg a-tocopherol (36 and 64), 223 mg retinol activity equivalents carotenes (86 and 14), 122 mg selenium
(89 and 11), and 210 mg flavonoids (98 and 2). Antioxidant intakes differed among sociodemographic subgroups and
lifestyle behaviors. Energy-adjusted dietary antioxidant intakes were higher in women, older adults, Caucasians,
nonconsumers of alcohol (only for vitamin C and carotenes), nonsmokers (only for vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenes), and
in those with a higher income and exercise level (except for flavonoids) than in their counterparts (P , 0.05). Consumption
of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may be a good strategy to increase antioxidant intake. The possible association
between antioxidant intake and the prevalence of chronic diseases should be investigated further. J. Nutr. 140: 317­324,

Introduction
An inverse association has been well established between dietary
intake of fruits and vegetables, which are rich sources of
antioxidants, and cardiovascular disease (CVD),8 when envi-
ronmental and lifestyle risk factors are controlled (1,2). With the
advancement of science, varying forms of natural antioxidants
with different strengths are being discovered in dietary sources
and dietary supplements. However, the health benefits of
antioxidant intake in reducing oxidative stress and inflamma-
tory process remains inconclusive (3­5). This is partially due to
the incompleteness of the intake data in various forms and doses
of antioxidants. Furthermore, antioxidants are present in human
diets in many different chemical forms, e.g. flavonoids, caro-
tenes, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium.
In fruits and vegetables, vitamin C contributes only ~14%
of the total antioxidant capacity and phenolic phytochemicals
such as flavonoids contribute the most (6,7). The phenolic
compounds that are the major sources of total antioxidant
capacity and prevent LDL oxidation are quercetin in apples
and onions; catechin, procyanidin, quercetin, and kaempferol
in grapes and wines; and genistein in soybeans (8­10).
Recently, high consumption of flavonoids and isoflavones by
Japanese women was related to their lower incidence of CVD
(11). Flavonoids and their derivatives are the most abundant
group of polyphenolics with antioxidant properties in diets (7).
The protective effect of flavonoid-rich foods on risk of chronic
diseases has been explained by their antioxidant properties
(12­15), whereas others reported no associations between
flavonoid intake and CVD risks (16­19). In 3 European studies
conducted in Finland (20), 7 European countries (21), and the
Netherlands (Zutphen) (22), the sum of dietary intakes of only
5 common flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, myrice-
tin, and quercetin) was inversely associated with the risks of
CVD. In studies conducted in the US (17­19), however, no
association was observed between flavonoid intake and CVD
risks. These studies quantitated only partial intakes of all
antioxidants because of methodological limitations imposed by
lack of flavonoid composition in foods, which were not
available until recently. The importance of antioxidants in
reducing risks of chronic diseases has been extensively studied;
however, antioxidant intake in a free-living population has not
yet been estimated adequately.
Recently, our research group reported estimates of the total
dietary flavonoid intake of the U.S. population based on the
recently released USDA flavonoid databases matched with food
consumption data from the NHANES 1999­2002 (23). Building

upon our previous research scheme to estimate flavonoid intake,
the present study aimed to document total antioxidant intakes
from diets and supplement sources in U.S. adults and socio-
demographic subgroups.
Materials and Methods
Study population. The National Center for Health Statistics has
conducted the NHANES to obtain nationally representative information
on the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population. All
interviewed persons were invited to the mobile examination center,
where the 24-h dietary recall (DR) and questionnaires on dietary
supplement use were administered. A total of 8809 individuals over 19 y
old in NHANES 1999­2000 and 2001­2002 were included in this study.
This study included vitamin C, vitamin E, carotene, flavonoid, and
selenium intakes from diet and dietary supplements to estimate the
individual and total antioxidant intakes.
The U.S. adult population was grouped by sociodemographic and
lifestyle variables: age (19­30, 31­50, 51­70, $70 y), gender, ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white; non-Hispanic black; Mexican-American; others),
BMI (,20, 20­24.9, 25­29.9, $30), poverty income ratios (PIR)
(,1.85, $1.85), alcohol consumption (yes or no to "at least 12 drinks/
y"), current smoking (yes or no to "current smoking" and "smoked
cigarettes, cigars, or pipes and/or used chewing tobacco or snuff at least
once during the past 30 d"), and exercise levels [expressed as the
metabolic equivalent (MET) score calculated by combining the intensity
level of the leisure time activities reported, mean duration, and
frequency] (24,25).
Food consumption data. Dietary antioxidant vitamin, selenium, and
flavonoid intakes were estimated based on one 24-h DR (midnight to
midnight) of the NHANES 1999­2002 (24,25). DR data contained all
foods and beverages consumed by the respondents except for plain
drinking water. To minimize errors from misreporting, individuals with
unreliable or incomplete DR records were excluded as noted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (26).
USDA flavonoid databases. Details of the datasets used in this study
were reported in our previous study (23). Briefly, we created 1 flavonoid
database from 2 different data sets released in recent years: 1) the USDA
Database for the Flavonoid Content of Selected Food (27) includes the
most abundant 19 individual flavonoid compounds in 5 flavonoid
subgroups (flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, and anthocya-
nidins) in 234 selected foods; 2) The USDA-Iowa State University
Database on the Isoflavone Content of Foods (28) was created by
extensive sampling of 108 soy-containing foods and subsequent analysis
at Iowa State University. The combined flavonoid database consisted of
24 flavonoid compounds: flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin,
isorhamnetin), flavones (luteolin, apigenin), flavanones (eriodictyol,
hesperetin, naringenin), flavan-3-ols (catechins, epicatechins, theafla-
vins, thearubigins), anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin,
pelargonidin, peonidin, petunidin), and isoflavones (daidzein, genistein,
glycitein, biochanin A, formononetin). To improve the coverage of the
estimated flavonoid intake, we expanded the flavonoid database
according to the preestablished protocol that has been described
extensively in a separate publication (23).
Estimation of dietary antioxidant intakes. We matched the NHANES
food consumption data with the flavonoid database following the steps
described in our previous work (23): 1) conversion of food items in
NHANES DR to USDA Standard Reference codes using food recipe
book and food description data file for NHANES food codes; 2) weight
adjustment using moisture content; 3) code modification using the USDA
food unit conversion search program; and 4) linking food intake data
with the flavonoid database. Daily individual flavonoid intake from
selected foods was determined by multiplying the content of the
individual flavonoid (mg aglycone equivalent/100 g food) by the daily
consumption (g/d) of the selected food item. Data on individual
participants' daily dietary intakes of antioxidant vitamins and selenium
were available in the NHANES 1999­2002 (24,25).
Estimation of antioxidant intakes from dietary supplement use.
The information on dietary supplement use in NHANES 1999­2002
enables investigators to estimate the individual participant's antioxidant
vitamin, selenium, and flavonoid intakes from dietary supplements.
Dietary supplement data files in the NHANES 1999­2000 and 2001­
2002 consist of 5 files: supplement counts, supplement records,
supplement information, ingredient information, and blend information
(24,25). To calculate the intakes of antioxidant nutrients from the
supplement, vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenes, selenium, and flavonoids
were selected from the ingredient information file. Next, nutrient
composition table of supplements containing the antioxidants was made
using the supplement information file. The antioxidant intakes from the
supplements were calculated using the supplement counts file, supple-
ment records file, and the nutrient composition table of supplements.
Ingredient units in the supplements were converted to the Dietary
Reference Intakes units. Nutrient compounds in the supplement were
converted to the elemental nutrients; e.g. the conversion factor of 43%
for ascorbyl palmitate to ascorbic acid was used (29).
In merging the nutrient intake datasets of NHANES 1999­2000 and
2001­2002, dietary intake data on carotenoids and vitamin E needed to
match their nutrient units. Among 6 carotenoids (a-carotene, b-
carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin) available
in the NHANES 2001­2002 dataset, only a-carotene and b-carotene
intake data were used in this study to estimate carotene intake in the
form of retinol activity equivalent (RAE), because the NHANES 1999­
2000 provides carotene intake (a-carotene + b-carotene) data only. For
the supplement label expressed as "b-carotene-% of vitamin A," the
content of b-carotene in the supplements was calculated after the content
of vitamin A in the supplement was found.
Vitamin E has several different units for the expression of its
activity. In the 1980 Recommended Dietary Allowances (30), units for
vitamin E were changed from IU to a-tocopherol equivalents taking
into account the activity of not only a-tocopherol, but also g-
tocopherol and d-tocopherol and tocotrienols. The 2000 Recommen-
ded Dietary Allowances and estimated average requirements (29) for
vitamin E were based only on 2 R, 49 R, 89 R-(RRR)-a-tocopherol, the
form found in food, and the 2R-stereoisomeric forms of a-tocopherol
that occur in fortified foods and supplements. The other tocopherols
and tocotrienols do not contribute toward meeting the vitamin E
requirement (29). Vitamin E was represented as a-tocopherol equiv-
alents in the NHANES 1999­2000 data file but as mg of a-tocopherol
in the NHANES 2001­2002 data file. Therefore, in merging the both
data files, a-tocopherol intake from diet and dietary supplements were
solely taken into consideration as vitamin E intake and expressed as mg
of a-tocopherol.
In merging the dietary supplement data of NHANES 1999­2000
and 2001­2002, the flavonoid intake from dietary supplements was
expressed on the total amount of flavonoid intake regardless of the
subcategories of flavonoids consumed. Lists of antioxidant nutrients
in NHANES 1999­2000 and NHANES 2001­2002 are shown in
Supplemental Table 2.
Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were carried out with SAS
software, release 8.1, 2000 (SAS Institute) and the Survey Data Analysis
for multi-stage sample designs professional software package (SUDAAN,
release 8.0.2, 2003, Research Triangle Institute). Sample weights were
applied to all analyses to account for the unequal probability of selec-
tion, noncoverage, and nonresponse bias resulting from oversampling
of low-income persons, adolescents, the elderly, African-Americans, and
Mexican-Americans.
Arithmetic means of dietary total and individual antioxidant intake
of subpopulations grouped by sociodemographic and lifestyle variables
were determined. SEM was calculated by the linearization (Taylor
series) variance estimation method for population parameters by
SUDAAN. We used t tests and ANOVA to test for overall differences of
antioxidant intakes from diet and supplements by sociodemographic
and lifestyle variables such as gender, income, and smoking, etc. The

trends of antioxidant intakes by the weight and frequency of specific
food groups consumed were tested using linear contrasts after
adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, PIR, current smoking status,
and exercise level. The contribution of each food group to the daily
total antioxidant intake was calculated as the ratio of the antioxidant
intake from that food group to the total intake from all foods. Values in
the text are means 6 SD.
Results
Daily antioxidant intakes from diets. The individual and
total antioxidant intakes from diet were estimated by combin-
ing the USDA Flavonoid databases and 24-h DR in the
NHANES 1999­2002 (Table 1). Energy-adjusted dietary
antioxidant intake increased with age (P-trend , 0.001),
income (P-trend , 0.01), and exercise level (P-trend , 0.05,
except for flavonoids). BMI was positively associated with
selenium intake (P-trend , 0.01) but inversely associated with
vitamin C (P-trend , 0.01) and E (P-trend , 0.1) intakes.
Energy-adjusted dietary antioxidant intake was also higher in
women than in men (P , 0.001 except for selenium). Alcohol
consumers had lower vitamin C and carotene intakes than
nonconsumers of alcohol (P , 0.01) and current smokers
consumed less vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenes from diet

than nonsmokers (P , 0.05). Caucasians consumed more
vitamin E and flavonoids (P-trend , 0.001) and less vitamin C
and carotenes from diet (P-trend , 0.01).
Antioxidant intakes from dietary supplements. The indi-
vidual and total antioxidant intakes from dietary supplements
were estimated based on the data of dietary supplement use in
the NHANES 1999­2002 (Table 2). Almost one-half of the
participants (48%) took at least 1 supplement per day and
antioxidant intake from supplements differed among socio-
demographic subgroups of U.S. adults (data not shown).
Energy-adjusted antioxidant intakes from dietary supplements
were higher in women (P , 0.05), older adults (P-trend
, 0.001 except for flavonoids, P-trend , 0.1), Caucasians
(P-trend , 0.01), those with higher exercise levels (except
for flavonoids), and higher income subgroups (P-trend ,
0.01).
Total antioxidant intakes. Total antioxidant intakes were
calculated by summing each participant's antioxidant intake
from diet and dietary supplements. Daily total antioxidant
intake was 207.9 6 7.1 mg vitamin C (46 and 54% from diets
and supplements, respectively), 19.8 6 0.7 mg a-tocopherol
(36 and 64%), 222.6 6 8.1 mg RAE carotenes (86 and 14%),

flavonoids (98 and 2%).
The impact of the consumption of specific food groups or
foods on individual antioxidant intakes was investigated by
testing the linear tends in individual dietary and total antiox-
idant intakes by the consumption of specific food groups, such as
fruits and fruit juices, vegetables and vegetable products, wines,
and teas. Only flavonoid intake from diet was used in the
analysis, because intake from was accounted for ,2% of the
total in this study. After adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI,
PIR, current smoking, and exercise level, fruit and fruit juice
consumption was positively associated with dietary and total
intake of vitamin C, carotenes, vitamin E, and selenium (P ,
0.05). Vegetable and vegetable product consumption was
positively associated with dietary and total intakes of all
individual antioxidants (P , 0.001); wine consumption with
total carotene and dietary flavonoid intake (P , 0.1); tea
consumption with total selenium intake (P , 0.05); and dietary
flavonoid intake (P , 0.001) (Table 3). Participants' self-
reported frequency of food group intake based on FFQ also
showed a consistent, but weaker association than the results
obtained from weight-based food consumption data (Supple-
mental Table 1).
Major dietary antioxidant sources. The major dietary sources
for the dietary vitamin C intake were: citrus fruit juices,
fruitaides and drinks, and other vegetables; vitamin E: mixture
mainly grain, fat, oil and dressing, and mixture mainly meat,
poultry, fish; carotenes: deep-yellow vegetables, dark-green
vegetables, and other vegetables; selenium: yeast breads, rolls,
mixture mainly meat, poultry, fish, and mixture mainly grain;
and total flavonoids: tea, citrus fruit juice, and beers and ales
(Table 4). Mixtures mainly grain includes foods such as burritos,
tacos, pizza, egg rolls, quiche, spaghetti with sauce, rice, and
pasta mixtures; frozen meals in which the main course is a grain
mixture; noodle and rice soups; and baby-food macaroni and
spaghetti mixtures. Citrus fruit juices were the major sources of
vitamin C, contributing 23% of daily dietary vitamin C intake;
vegetables were the major sources for carotene, contributing
58% of daily dietary carotene intake; and teas were identified as
the most remarkable sources of flavonoids, contributing 77% of
daily flavonoid intake.
Discussion
The mean daily vitamin C intake in U.S. adults was 95.5 mg
from diet only and 207.9 mg from both diet and supplement in
the present study, suggesting that supplements are a major
source for vitamin C intake in the US. Compared with our
results, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Trial
(31) reported a higher mean vitamin C intake of 159.7 mg/d for
men who did not consume vitamin supplements compared with
a lower total vitamin C intake of 177.8 mg/d for male
supplement users. Data on supplement use in the Prostate,
Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Trial was, however,
limited to 12 individual supplements only. In 2009, the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
Study (32) reported that the mean daily intake of dietary vitamin
C in Europe ranged from 80.1 mg (Norway) to 200.8 mg
(Greece), which is in accordance with our findings. Another
European study (33) reported that the mean daily vitamin C
intake from diet in elderly adults in Spain was 125.4 mg for men
and 136.3 mg for women. The dietary vitamin C intake of
Europeans is overall higher than that of the U.S. population
presented in this study and the difference can be explained by the
fact that fruit and vegetable intake in Europe on average is
higher compared with in the US (34).
We reported a dietary a-tocopherol intake of 7.1 mg/d in this
study, which was a bit lower than that of the European
population, ranging from 7.3 mg (Sweden) to 13.3 mg (France),
in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition Study (32). In the present study, vitamin E intake was
significantly higher in nonsmokers (7.2 mg) than in smokers (6.9
mg), which was slightly lower than, but in a good accordance
with, the previous study by the Minnesota Heart Survey (35).
Our estimation of vitamin E intake might be underestimated,
because in our study, only a-tocopherol intake was counted for
the estimation. The same study reported a mean b-carotene
intake of 1064­1408 mg from diet. Dietary b-carotene intake in
Europe ranged from 1600 mg/d (Spain) to 4480 mg/d (Greece)
(32). Dietary flavonoid intake in our study (207 mg/d) was much
higher than previous reports (36,37). This is due to the fact that
previous studies were limited to a small number of flavonoids.
Daily dietary selenium intake in this study (108.5 mg) was
slightly lower than selenium intake reported in a Japanese study
(129 6 23 mg) (38). However, the dietary selenium intake of
women in this study (89.2 mg) was in accordance with a previous
study of 74 young health Spanish women (83.3 mg) (39). The
selenium contents in foodstuffs depend on the soil for plant food
items, the feed for stockbreeding products, and the sea condi-
tions for marine products (38). Therefore, the levels vary by
dietary patterns, geographic regions, and agricultural practices.
Our study found that individual and total antioxidant intake
from diet and supplement differed among sociodemographic
subgroups. Energy-adjusted antioxidant intake from diet in-
creased with age, income, and exercise level (except for
flavonoids) in agreement with previous studies (23,40). In
2004, Gu et al. (40) reported proanthocyanidin intake was
highest in men older than 60 y. As previously reported by our
research group (23), flavonoid density of the diet increased with
age, income, physical activity, Caucasian descent, female sex,
and vitamin supplement use. In our study, smokers consumed
less vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenes than nonsmokers. This
is consistent with previous findings (35,41). Nevertheless, it
raises a serious public health concern, because smokers are
exposed to increased oxidative stress and have a higher demand
for antioxidant vitamins than nonsmokers.
Energy-adjusted antioxidant intake from supplement was
higher in women, older adults (except flavonoids), Caucasians,
and those with higher exercise level (except flavonoids) and
higher income compared with their counterparts. These findings
are in agreement with previous studies (42­44). Evaluating the
NHANES III survey, Balluz et al. (42) reported that the use of
supplements was highest in women, non-Hispanic whites, and
participants with the highest levels of education and income.
Lyle et al. (43) identified supplement users among 2152 middle-
and older age adults in Wisconsin. They found women;
participants with high levels of education, low BMI, and active
lifestyles; and nonsmokers take more supplements than their
counterparts. Jasti et al. (44) reported that middle-aged or older
women, Caucasians, those well-educated and with higher
income levels, and residents of western parts of the US were
more likely to use supplements than their counterparts.
We found that consumption of fruits, fruit juices, vegetables,
and wine were positively associated with dietary and total
antioxidant intake. Fruit, fruit juices, and vegetables have
previously been identified as major sources of antioxidant

vitamins (45,46). Wine consumption has been associated with
higher total carotene and dietary flavonoid intake in our study. It
has previously been reported that supplement users have a
higher intake of micronutrients from food, including vitamin C,
vitamin E, and carotenoids, independent of antioxidant intake
from supplements (43). This finding is similar to a previous study
in that supplement users were identified to consume more wine
than nonusers (42).
We identified the major food sources of dietary vitamin C in
the US as citrus fruit juice, fruitades, potatoes, tomatoes, and
other vegetables. In agreement with our findings, Hampl et al.
(45) reported the leading sources of vitamin C in the U.S. diet as
fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, and vitamin C-fortified fruit
drinks. A Spanish study (46) found that fruits (mainly oranges),
tomato, and sweet pepper were the major sources for vitamin C
in the Spanish diet. According to our findings, dietary vitamin E
in the US was mainly derived from grain, fat, oil, dressing, meat,
poultry, fish, potatoes, nuts, and seeds. Our findings are
consistent with the reports by the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services and the USDA, who identified food items
with high amounts of vitamin E (47), except for potatoes, meat,
and poultry. The latter 3 are most likely to contribute to vitamin
E intake because of their high amount of consumption by U.S.
adults. Major food sources of dietary vitamin E in Spain were
vegetable oils (sunflower and olive), noncitrus fruits, nuts, and
seeds (48). Our study found deep-yellow vegetables, dark green
vegetables, and other vegetables were the major food source of
carotenes in the U.S. diet. This is in agreement with previous
studies (46,47). The antioxidant mineral selenium was mainly
consumed in yeast breads, grains, meat, poultry, fish, and eggs by
U.S. adults. In agreement with our findings, a Japanese study
(38) reported fish, shellfish, cereals, meat, and dairy products as
the major food sources for selenium. Dietary flavonoids were
primarily consumed in tea, followed by citrus fruit juice, beer,
wine, and citrus fruits. Previous studies reported that onion is
the major source of flavonoids in the U.S. (36). and Japanese (11)
diets. However, these studies did not consider intake of tea
catechins, which have previously been shown to be major
contributors to total flavonoid intake by our group (23). In the
Zutphen elderly study, the major sources of flavonoid intake
were reported as tea, onion, and apple (37). In 2004, a research
group found tea to be the major flavonoid source in the

Australian diet, followed by orange (48). They also found that
flavonoid sources varied among different age groups. In adults,
red wine was a major catechin and epicatechin source, whereas
in children it was apples, apricots, and grapes.
Our findings are interpreted based on several assumptions:
first, the USDA food composition databases were constructed
based on U.S. representative food samples, including varying
cultivars, geographic origin, growing seasons, agricultural
practices, and analytical methods. Second, this study focused
on antioxidant intake, not bioavailability and metabolism in the
human body or changes during processing and food preparation.
Third, dietary intake data were based on a 24-h DR that might
be a limitation of this study, because there is no scientific
agreement on the minimum period of dietary data collection to
obtain an approximation of usual intake for the antioxidants.
However, despite within-person variability, a 24-h DR can
produce adequate estimates of mean intake of a group that can
be useful for contrasting the dietary status of the group with
different levels of risk factors for certain diseases (49).
In summary, the results of this study demonstrated that daily
antioxidant intakes from diet and dietary supplements are
significantly different in adult subgroups having different socio-
demographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviors. In this study,
we focused on the documentation of the antioxidant intake levels
based on food composition tables; thus, further research is needed
to study individual bioavailability, metabolism in the human
body, and changes during processing and food preparation.
Estimated total antioxidant intake from both diets and
supplement is a prerequisite to investigating the implicated
relation between the antioxidant intake and the prevalence of
chronic diseases within a population and its subgroups. To our
knowledge, this was the first documentation on the antioxidant
intake status of U.S. adults and subgroups on a large scale.
Having a reliable and valid assessment of dietary intake is the
first step to establishing recommended dietary intakes that
promote public health. The findings of this study will play a
pivotal role in promoting and protecting national health through
concerted efforts of policymakers, public health officers, nutri-
tion and health educators in the government, the food and
supplement industry, and academia. Furthermore, the well-
documented health disparity in the US may also be partially
explained by the marked differences in antioxidant intake
among different socioeconomic subgroups.

antioxidant intakes from diet and supplements in U.S. adults. J Nutr. 140:317­24.
Table 1: The age range of the first age subgroup should be 19­30 y, the vitamin C
intake of the 51­70 y age subgroup should be 99.4 6 3.4 mg/d, and the vitamin E intake
of the 51­70 y age subgroup should be 7.1 6 0.2 mg/d a-tocopherol.
In Tables 1 and 2, BMI subgroups of 20 to #25 and 25 to #30 should be corrected to
20 to ,25 and 25 to ,30, respectively.

¨tjohann D, von
Bergmann K, Plat J, Mensink RP (2007). Customary use of plant sterol and plant stanol
enriched margarine is associated with changes in serum plant sterol and stanol
concentrations in humans. J Nutr. 137:1301­6.
An error occurred on page 1303, in the paragraph on serum plant sterols. The first
sentence of the paragraph that describes decreased concentrations in plant sterol­
enriched margarine users, including percentages and P-values, is incorrect. The
concentrations in plant sterol­enriched margarine users increased. This error does not
affect other parts of the paper: the numbers and percentages presented in the Abstract
and in Table 2 are correct.
The corrected paragraph on serum plant sterols should read as follows:
Serum plant sterols. In users of plant sterol­enriched margarine, cholesterol-
standardized sitosterol concentrations increased by 22% (P , 0.0001) and the
cholesterol-standardized campesterol concentrations increased by 103% (P , 0.0001)
between baseline and 5-y follow-up, resulting in greater changes in concentration than in
all nonusers (P , 0.05) (Table 2). In users of plant stanol­enriched margarine, the
cholesterol-standardized sitosterol concentration tended to decrease during the 5 y
(18%, P ¼ 0.06) and the cholesterol-standardized campesterol concentration tended to
decrease by 11% (P ¼ 0.11); these changes did not differ from those of all nonusers.
