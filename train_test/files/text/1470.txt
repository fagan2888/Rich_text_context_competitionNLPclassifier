Abstract
Food insecurity refers to the inability to afford enough food for an active, healthy life. Numerous studies have shown
associations between food insecurity and adverse health outcomes among children. Studies of the health effects of food
insecurity among adults are more limited and generally focus on the association between food insecurity and self-reported
disease. We therefore examined the association between food insecurity and clinical evidence of diet-sensitive chronic
disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Our population-based sample included 5094 poor adults
aged 18­65 y participating in the NHANES (1999­2004 waves). We estimated the association between food insecurity
(assessed by the Food Security Survey Module) and self-reported or laboratory/examination evidence of diet-sensitive
chronic disease using Poisson regression. We adjusted the models to account for differences in age, gender, race,
educational attainment, and income. Food insecurity was associated with self-reported hypertension [adjusted relative risk
(ARR) 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04­1.38] and hyperlipidemia (ARR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09­1.55), but not diabetes (ARR 1.19; 95% CI,
0.89­1.58). Food insecurity was associated with laboratory or examination evidence of hypertension (ARR 1.21; 95% CI,
1.04­1.41) and diabetes (ARR 1.48; 95% CI, 0.94­2.32). The association with laboratory evidence of diabetes did not reach
significance in the fully adjusted model unless we used a stricter definition of food insecurity (ARR 2.42; 95% CI, 1.44­
4.08). These data show that food insecurity is associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Health policy discussions should
focus increased attention on ability to afford high-quality foods for adults with or at risk for chronic disease. J. Nutr. 140:

Introduction
Food insecurity refers to the inability to afford nutritionally
adequate and safe foods (1). In 2008, more than 14% of all U.S.
households, 49 million people, were food insecure (2). Most
adults living in food-insecure households report being unable to
afford balanced meals, worrying about the adequacy of their
food supply, running out of food, and cutting the size of meals or
skipping meals. At the most severe levels of food insecurity,
many adults report being hungry because there was not enough
money for food and not eating for an entire day (2). Each
episode of food insecurity is generally short in duration.
However, the dietary changes associated with food insecurity
may persist over extended periods, because food-insecure
households often experience repeated food budget shortages.
On average, households that report being food insecure at some
time during the year are food insecure for 7 mo during the year
(2).
Common household responses to inadequate food supplies
include food budget adjustments, reduced food intake, and
alterations in types of food served (3­6). Dietary variety
decreases and consumption of energy-dense foods increases.
These energy-dense foods, including refined grains, added
sugars, and added saturated/trans fats, tend to be of poor
nutritional quality and less expensive calorie-for-calorie than
alternatives (7,8). U.S. adults living in food-insecure households
consume fewer weekly servings of fruits, vegetables, and dairy
and lower levels of micronutrients, including the B complex
vitamins, magnesium, iron, zinc, and calcium (5,9,10). These
dietary patterns are linked to the development of chronic
disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes
(11,12).
There have been many studies suggesting that food insecurity
among children has adverse health effects, including increased
rates of iron-deficiency anemia, acute infection, chronic illness,
and developmental and mental health problems (13­19). A

number of studies have demonstrated associations between food
insecurity and overweight/obesity among children and adult
women using both self-reported and objective measures of BMI
(20), although results among children have been inconsistent
(21­23).
However, there have been few studies evaluating the associ-
ation between food insecurity and chronic disease among adults.
What studies have been done generally rely on self-reported
measures without confirmation of the association using objec-
tive measures of chronic disease. Using clinical evidence of
disease is important in low-income populations, because delays
in medical care may preferentially reduce disease diagnosis
among the most financially vulnerable, biasing results toward an
underestimate of the association between food insecurity and
chronic disease (24).
In this study, we used a population-based sample to evaluate
associations between food insecurity and objectively measured
cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipid-
emia, and diabetes. Because we used examination and labora-
tory data to assess the presence of chronic disease, we were able
to quantify both the prevalence and severity of these conditions
among adults living in food-insecure households.
Methods
Sample. The NHANES is a cross-sectional, nationally representative
survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population (25). Details
of recruitment have been published previously (26). We combined data
from the 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004 waves of NHANES.
We restricted our analysis to adults aged 18­65 y reporting household
incomes #200% of the federal poverty level (FPL).4 We excluded
children because of the low prevalence of the chronic diseases in which
we were interested; the elderly because of the high prevalence of the
chronic diseases in which we were interested (suggesting alternative
disease pathways) and because of differences in access to health care
between poor elderly and poor nonelderly adults; pregnant women
because pregnancy affects the clinical variables in which we were
interested; and individuals living in households reporting incomes
.200% of the FPL because the prevalence of food insecurity in these
households is ,4% (27). The FPL is a number updated annually by the
Census Bureau to reflect the household income at which a family is
considered to be in poverty. The FPL varies according to household size
and age composition; e.g. the FPL for a family of 2 adults and 2 children
in 2008 was $21,834.
Data collection. All NHANES participants completed an English or
Spanish version of an interviewer-administered questionnaire in their
own home. Participants then attended a specially equipped mobile
examination center where they underwent a standardized physical
(including height, weight, and blood pressure measurements) and
laboratory examination (28). A random subset of participants under-
went a fasting laboratory examination.
Food security. More than 99% of the eligible sample participated in the
Food Security Survey Module, which is a well-validated questionnaire
developed by the USDA to measure household food security over the
prior 12 mo (6,29). Because we were interested in adult health outcomes,
we used responses to only the 10 household and adult items in the 18-
item scale. (The remaining 8 items refer to household children.) Using
validated cutpoints, we considered an adult to be food secure if #2 items
in the scale were answered affirmatively (often referred to as high and
marginal food security) and food insecure if $3 items were answered
affirmatively (often referred to as low and very low food security) (6). In
a sensitivity analysis, we also dichotomized the scale as #5 affirmative
responses (high, marginal, and low food security) and $6 affirmative
responses (very low food security). The Chronbach's a for the scale
ranges from 0.74 to 0.93 (30).
Clinical variables. We evaluated as dependent variables both a self-
reported and a clinical diagnosis of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
diabetes. Self-reported disease was identified by affirmative answers to
the question "Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you
(that you had hypertension, also called high blood pressure) (that your
blood cholesterol level was high) (that you have diabetes or sugar
diabetes)?" Either of 2 criteria was used to define participants with
clinical disease: out-of-range laboratory/examination measures or med-
ication use. Using this method, we included as having clinical disease
those who had undiagnosed disease (out-of-range laboratory/examina-
tion measures) as well as those with diagnosed disease who were being
successfully treated such that their laboratory/examination measures
were now in the normal range (medication use). That is, we considered
clinical evidence of hypertension to be either a measured systolic blood
pressure (SBP) .140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) .90 mm
Hg, consistent with current Joint National Committee guidelines (31), or
self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. We considered clinical
evidence of hyperlipidemia to be either a total cholesterol concentration
$240 mg/dL (6.22 mmol/L) or a fasting LDL cholesterol concentration
$160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L), consistent with current Adult Treatment
Panel-III guidelines (32), or self-reported use of lipid-lowering therapy.
We considered clinical evidence of diabetes to be either a fasting plasma
glucose $126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L), consistent with American Diabetes
Association and WHO guidelines (33,34), or self-reported use of insulin
or oral hypoglycemic medication.
Our covariates included sociodemographic factors known to be
associated with chronic disease and/or food insecurity, including age,
gender, race/ethnicity (self-reported non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic
Black, Hispanic, or other/multiple), education (less than high school,
high school degree, or more than high school degree), and household
income. To fully adjust for income, we included income as both
continuous and categorical (0­50, 50.1­100, 100.1­150, or
150.1­200% of the FPL) variables.
Statistical analysis. Results were weighted to represent the noninsti-
tutionalized U.S. population aged 18­65 y. We used the complex survey
commands in Stata 9.2 (2007) to obtain weighted estimates, SE, and
P-values that correctly reflected the stratification and clustering of
observations induced by NHANES' design. We used 6-y interview
weights for self-reported variables and mobile examination center
weights for laboratory and examination data. We considered all
P-values , 0.05 as significant.
We compared differences in baseline characteristics using the design-
based F statistic. We estimated the association between food insecurity
and disease prevalence using Poisson regression with robust SE and
estimated probabilities directly from the regression models. We report an
unadjusted prevalence, a crude relative risk (CRR; adjusting for age,
gender, and race/ethnicity), and an adjusted relative risk (ARR; adjusting
for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income). For participants
with more than 1 diagnosis (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes),
we evaluated each condition independently.
To determine whether self-management capacity among those with
chronic disease was limited by food insecurity, we evaluated the subset of
adults who self-reported a disease diagnosis for inadequate control. We
defined control as adherence to current treatment goals, because we were
interested in whether food-insecure adults were at increased risk of long-
term complications related to chronic disease. For hypertension, we
defined inadequate control as blood pressure .140/90 mm Hg, for
hyperlipidemia a total cholesterol concentration $200 mg/dL (5.18
mmol/L) or LDL cholesterol $140 mg/dL (3.63 mmol/L) (35), and for
diabetes a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) .7% (36). Where significant
associations between food insecurity and inadequate disease control
were found, we used linear regression to estimate the association with
continuous outcomes.

We performed 3 sensitivity analyses. In the first, we defined food
insecurity using all 18 items of the Food Security Survey Module,
including the 8 items referring to the food security status of children in
the household that were not included in the main analysis. Second, we
used a more severe definition of food insecurity ($6 affirmative
responses rather than $3 affirmative responses). Finally, we included
BMI (calculated in kg/m2 from measured height and weight) in the
adjusted models to determine the extent to which food insecurity might
independently contribute to the development of cardiovascular risk
factors.
The available sample size varies for the dependent variables because
of skip patterns and the way in which NHANES participants are chosen
to undergo the fasting laboratory evaluation. For example, all adults had
total cholesterol level data as part of the laboratory evaluation (n =
4559), but only adults reporting they had had their cholesterol checked
in the past were asked if they had been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia
(n = 1930). Because weighting accounts for differential sampling
probabilities, we used the entire available sample for each analysis
rather than restricting the analysis to the subset of adults for whom we
had access to complete data. The sample sizes available for each analysis
are indicated in the tables. This secondary data analysis was approved by
the Committee of Human Research at the University of California San
Francisco.
Results
NHANES 1999­2004 included 31,126 individuals. We re-
stricted from the analysis pregnant women (n = 679), youth
(,18 y of age) (n = 14,047), and the elderly (.65 y of age) (n =
4099). We excluded another 7162 participants because of a
household income .200% of the FPL and 45 participants
because they did not respond to the Food Security Survey
Module. These exclusions resulted in 5094 participants. Of
these participants, 95.6% of those from food-secure households
and 98.5% of those from food-insecure households also
participated in the mobile examination/laboratory evaluation
(n = 4908).
Latino households were more likely to be food insecure than
White households (P , 0.001). Household food insecurity was
also associated with low educational attainment, low house-
hold income, lack of health insurance, and tobacco use (Table
1). Consistent with previous studies, we observed an associa-
tion between food insecurity and a higher BMI among women
only.
We combined results for men and women because stratifica-
tion by gender yielded similar risk estimates for men and
women. Among adults from food-secure households, 18.6% had
clinical evidence of hypertension compared with 22.4% of
adults from food-insecure households (Table 2). In adjusted
analyses, adults from food-insecure households had a 21%
(95% CI, 4­41%) higher risk of clinical hypertension than
adults from food-secure households (P = 0.02). Mean SBP and
DBP did not differ by food security status (data not shown). The
association between household food insecurity and clinical
evidence of hyperlipidemia was not significant (P = 0.4).
There was clinical evidence of diabetes among 7.4% of adults
living in food-secure households and 10.2% of adults living in
food-insecure households. The risk of clinical diabetes was
~50% higher among adults living in food-insecure households
compared with adults living in food-secure households (crude
P = 0.03; adjusted P = 0.09).
Among adults already diagnosed with disease, food insecu-
rity was associated with inadequate control of diabetes (ARR
1.35; 95% CI, 1.05­1.74) but not hypertension or hyperlipid-
emia (Table 3). Mean HbA1c among adults with a self-reported
diagnosis of diabetes (n = 428) was 7.4% among adults living in
food-secure households and 8.1% among adults living in food-
insecure households (crude P = 0.09, adjusted P = 0.1).
When we dichotomized food security at $6 affirmative
responses (instead of $3 affirmative responses), indicating more
severe food insecurity, the association between food insecurity
and hypertension was no longer significant, although the
prevalence was similar, suggesting an insufficient sample size.

The association between food insecurity and both self-reported
and clinical diabetes was highly significant. The unadjusted
prevalence of self-reported diabetes was 6.7% among adults in
food-secure households compared with 10.6% among those in
food-insecure households (CRR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.07­2.24; ARR
1.52; 95% CI, 1.04­2.25). Unadjusted prevalence of clinical
diabetes was 7.0% among adults in food-secure households
compared with 15.9% among those in food-insecure households
(CRR 2.52; 95% CI, 1.61­3.94; ARR 2.42; 95% CI, 1.44­
4.08). The risk of clinical diabetes among those who did not self-
report a diagnosis of diabetes (suggesting undiagnosed disease)
appeared higher among adults living in food-insecure house-
holds than in food-secure households; however, this difference
remained significant in the crude analysis only (CRR 2.73; 95%
CI, 1.34­5.58; ARR 1.22; 95% CI, 0.55­2.72).
Our results were unchanged if we used the full 18-item scale to
assess food insecurity rather than only the 10 items that reference
adults in the household. Adding BMI as a covariate to the adjusted
models did not change the association between food insecurity and
hypertension or hyperlipidemia but made the association between
food insecurity and clinical diabetes significant (CRR 1.63; 95%
CI, 1.08­2.45; ARR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.02­2.65).
Discussion
Among nonelderly adults with household incomes ,200% of
the FPL, food insecurity is associated with clinical evidence of
hypertension and diabetes. Evidence for an association between
food insecurity and hyperlipidemia is weak and not significant.
We previously reported an association between food insecurity
and a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes (37). This study
confirms these findings with clinical evidence of disease and
suggests that adults living in food-insecure households may be
more likely to underreport a diagnosis of diabetes.
A number of studies have reported cross-sectional associa-
tions between food insecurity and self-reported chronic disease,
including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and general
health status (5,11,12,38). In a sample of .2500 adults
recruited from community sites in rural Ohio, Holben et al.
(39) found no relationship between food insecurity and clinical
indicators of disease, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
and hyperglycemia, except for higher mean HbA1c levels among
women. Our work in a population-based sample suggests that
food insecurity may in fact be a risk factor for hypertension and
diabetes among nonelderly adults.
Controlling for BMI did not attenuate the association
between food insecurity and chronic disease, suggesting that
these associations cannot be entirely attributed to an increased
prevalence of obesity among food-insecure women. However,
hypotheses to explain the association between food insecurity
and obesity among women might also explain associations
between food insecurity and the diet-sensitive chronic diseases
we evaluated in this study (11,12,39). These hypotheses include
food substitutions that emphasize relatively inexpensive but

energy-dense foods (3,9,40), overconsumption during food
plenty in expectation of future food shortages (41,42), and the
"thrifty gene hypothesis," which suggests that it is adaptive to
more efficiently accumulate fat when food is unpredictable (43).
For example, the high sodium and low potassium content of
highly processed foods, common in the diets of food-insecure
adults, may increase risk of developing hypertension (44,45). We
are aware of no studies demonstrating a pattern of increased
sodium and decreased potassium intake associated with food
insecurity (9,10), although qualitative work has suggested that
food-insecure adults have difficulty affording low-sodium food
alternatives (46).
Food insecurity also appears to be more strongly associated
with diabetes than with hypertension, particularly at the most
severe levels of food insecurity. There are a number of reasons
why this stronger association may exist. First, diabetes may be
more highly sensitive to diet, whereas hypertension and hyper-
lipidemia may be more highly sensitive to medication adherence.
Second, an extension of the thrifty gene hypothesis suggests that
peripheral insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes, may be
adaptive in association with food insecurity insofar as it allows
for the preservation of muscle tissue during food restriction (47).
Third, food insecurity is a highly stressful state, both emotion-
ally and physiologically (48). The elevated cortisol associated
with such stress is frequently linked to adiposity, particularly the
visceral adiposity that is a strong risk factor for diabetes. Finally,
replacement of dietary fruits and vegetables with relatively
inexpensive carbohydrates, such as refined starches, increases
dietary glycemic load and may increase the risk of developing
diabetes in predisposed individuals (49­51).
We also showed an association between food insecurity and
inadequate glycemic control among adults diagnosed with
diabetes. This result might also be explained by the highly diet-
sensitive nature of diabetes. In addition, self-management
capacity may be limited by difficulty affording prescription
medications in the face of extreme financial hardship. The
depression, fatigue, and poor self-efficacy that often accompany
food insecurity may exert additional effects (52). These self-
management barriers may establish a cycle in which higher health
care expenditures reduce food budgets; in turn, reduced food
budgets decrease self-management capacity and poor self-man-
agement further increases medication needs, complication rates,
and health care expenditures (53). This cycle may be exacerbated
by the relative dearth of full-service grocery stores in many low-
income, and particularly African-American, neighborhoods
across the US (54,55). While healthy adults may be able to access
transportation outside of the neighborhood, those with chronic
disease may rely more heavily on corner stores and convenience
stores for food purchases. Food available from corner and
convenience stores tends to be of lower nutritional quality and
more expensive, further limiting healthy food purchases (56).
There are 2 mechanisms whereby diabetes may increase the
risk of food insecurity. First, the out-of-pocket health care
expenditures associated with chronic disease may force adults
into food insecurity (57). Second, health education provided to
patients with chronic disease may increase awareness of dietary
intake and ability to afford healthy foods, causing a perception
of food insecurity that may not have been otherwise noted.
These potential explanations for an effect-cause relationship
deserve further study.
Our study was limited by small sample sizes for some
variables, in particular for inadequate disease control among
adults with self-reported disease. The Food Security Survey
Module assesses food security at the household level, which may
misclassify some individuals as food insecure if other household
members are food insecure. However, most adults in a house-
hold are food insecure when the household is food insecure (6)
and any misclassification biases our results toward the null
hypothesis. A single blood pressure or blood sugar measurement
is generally not adequate for a diagnosis of hypertension or
diabetes. This misclassification is also likely to bias our results
toward the null hypothesis. Differential rates of nonparticipa-
tion may have biased study results. We limited our sample to
households with incomes ,200% of the FPL. This sample
restriction limits the generalizability of our findings to the U.S.
population as a whole but provides important new information
about the population generally at risk for food insecurity and
increases the homogeneity of our sample with respect to
unmeasured potential confounders (such as neighborhood
environment). Finally, we used a self-reported measure of food
insecurity, because no objective measures of food insecurity (as it
is currently conceptualized) exist. However, use of a self-
reported measure is appropriate because many of the effects of
food insecurity may be mediated by an individual perception of
the degree to which food budgets are inadequate. Despite these
limitations, this study adds important population-based data to
our understanding of the association between food insecurity
and chronic disease.
A number of interventions designed to reduce the financial
burden associated with healthy dietary intake have been
successful at improving dietary intake. In 1 study, breast-feeding
mothers receiving Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children benefits, a public health program
providing food subsidies to pregnant and postpartum women
and their children, were offered 10-dollar vouchers for fresh
fruits and vegetables. Voucher redemption rates were ~90% and
fruit/vegetable consumption increased (58,59). In another study,
delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables to low-income, home-
bound elders, some of whom reported an inability to afford
fruits and vegetables, effectively increased fruit and vegetable
consumption (60,61). The long-term health implications of these
interventions are unclear.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly
the Food Stamp Program) has a well-established and highly
successful infrastructure to reduce rates of food insecurity
across the US. To the extent to which SNAP can encourage
shifts in dietary intake toward healthy food alternatives, it
might also have the potential to prevent the development of
diet-sensitive chronic disease and improve health outcomes.
Ongoing and planned modifications to the Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program attempt to encourage these
dietary shifts. Using physiologic measures to rigorously eval-
uate the health implications of these modifications will help
determine the extent to which these programs may improve the
health of the population by reducing the prevalence of
hypertension and diabetes.
