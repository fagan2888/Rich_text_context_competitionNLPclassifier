OBJECTIVEdThe possible interaction of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and obe-
sity in regard to type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance has not been well studied. To explore the
effect modification of obesity on the association between 25(OH)D and insulin resistance/type 2
diabetes, data were examined from a nationally representative sample.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdThe analytic sample for the type 2 diabetes
analysis (n = 12,900) was limited to participants from the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES) 2001­2006 over 20 years of age. Participants .20 years of age
assigned to the morning session and free of diabetes were limited to the insulin resistance analysis
(n = 5,806). Multiplicative interaction was assessed through a cross-product interaction term in a
multiple logistic regression model. The presence of additive interaction between insufficient
25(OH)D and obesity (indicated by BMI or waist circumference) was evaluated by calculation of
the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and attributable proportion due to interaction (AP).
RESULTSdThere wasnomultiplicativeinteraction of insufficient 25(OH)Dand obesity on type 2
diabetes or insulin resistance. Furthermore, none of the RERI or AP values were statistically
significant in the diabetes analysis. However, there was strong additive interaction between
abdominal obesity and insufficient 25(OH)D (RERI 6.45 [95% CI 1.03­11.52]) in regard to
insulin resistance. In addition, 47% of the increased odds of insulin resistance can be explained
by interaction between insufficient 25(OH)D and high BMI (AP 0.47 [95% CI 0.08­0.87]).
CONCLUSIONSdWithin a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample, abdominal obe-
sity and insufficient 25(OH)D interact to synergistically influence the risk of insulin resistance.

Recent meta-analyses and systematic
reviewstudiesindicatethathighserum
25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
concentration may be associated with
lower risk of insulin resistance and type
2 diabetes (1­4). Vitamin D is thought to
impact type 2 diabetes through various
mechanisms, including impaired pancre-
atic b-cell function and insulin resistance
(5,6). Many of these pathways are biolog-
ically relevant to obesity as well, given that
obesity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes
(7­9), insulin resistance (10­12), and low
serum 25(OH)D (13­16).
Although the association between
25(OH)D and insulin resistance is consis-
tentlyobserved across multiplestudies,this
association may vary by obesity status.
Serum 25(OH)D concentration was not
associated with insulin sensitivity in obese
Caucasian women either before bariatric
surgery or 10 years postsurgery (17). Obe-
sity may modify the association between
25(OH)D concentration and risk of type
2 diabetes. It has been demonstrated that
the association between serum 25(OH)D
concentration and A1C was stronger in
BritishadultsthathadahighBMIcompared
with adults that had a low BMI after full
covariate adjustment (15).
Because of decreased bioavailability of
vitamin D due to excess storage in body fat
compartments, obesity may interact with
vitamin D to synergistically influence risk of
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (18).
However,thepossibleinteractionofvitamin
D and obesity with regard to type 2 diabetes
and insulin resistance has not been well
studied. In a recently published study, the
association of serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tion with insulin sensitivity was found to be
stronger in overweight individuals than in
normal-weight individuals (19). Although
suggestive, this study was limited in that it
featured a small sample of younger adults
from a university campus with limited
racial/ethnic groups. To further explore
the effect modification of obesity on the
association between 25(OH)D and insulin
resistance/type 2 diabetes, we examined
datafromtheNationalHealth and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), a large,
nationally representative sample from
across the U.S.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODSdNHANES are nationally
representative surveys conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS), part of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Survey participants
from the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian
population were selected using a stratified
multistage probability sample design. In
order toincrease the reliabilityandprecision
of estimates, participant recruitment in-
cluded oversampling of adolescents, elderly
persons, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican
Americans, and low-income, non-Hispanic
whites. Survey participants were inter-
viewed and invited for a clinical examina-
tion. Physical examinations and collection
of blood samples were conducted in a
mobile examination clinic (MEC). After
collection from participants, serum speci-
mens were processed, stored, and shipped
to the Division of Laboratory Sciences at
the National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention, for analysis. The NCHS ethics
review board approved the survey, and
participants provided informed consent
prior to participation.
Data were analyzed from NHANES
2001­2006, and the analytic sample was
limited to participants .20 years of age.
Survey questions that assess smoking be-
havior were only asked to participants .20
years of age. The unweighted response
rates for the years 2001­2006 were be-
tween 79 and 84% for the interviewed
sample and between 76 and 80% for the
MEC-examined sample.
Serum 25(OH)D concentration
In NHANES 2001­2006, serum 25(OH)D
concentration was measured using a radio-
immunoassay kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater,
MN) (20). The coefficient of variation for
the instrument for the years 2001­2006
was between 10 and 13%, and the sensitiv-
ity for the assay was 1.5 ng/mL (21). Serum
25(OH)D data files were updated in No-
vember 2010, and these data were used
because NCHS has recommended that
the adjusted data rather than the previously
available, unadjusted data be used for all
analyses of serum 25(OH)D concentration
for NHANES 2001­2006 (22).
25(OH)D concentration is generally
understood to reflect total intake of vitamin
D from cutaneous synthesis and dietary
intake (23). The Institute of Medicine
released a report in November 2010 on vi-
tamin Dstatuscategorizingserum25(OH)D:
risk of deficiency, ,12 ng/mL; risk of inad-
equacy, 12­19 ng/mL; sufficiency, 20­50
ng/mL; and possible harm, .50 ng/mL
(3). For multiple regression analysis, vita-
min D status will be reported as sufficient
(20­50 ng/mL) or insufficient (,20 ng/mL).
Few (;1%) participants are at risk for pos-
sible harm due to high serum 25(OH)D
concentration.
Outcomes
Casedefinition oftype2 diabetes was based
on fulfillment of the American Diabetes
Association criteria (24) for diabetes diag-
nosis (fasting plasma glucose concentration
$126 mg/dL, 2-h plasma glucose $200
mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance
test, or A1C $6.5%) or an answer of
"yes" to any of the following questions.
1) Other than during pregnancy, have
you ever been told by a doctor or other
health professional that you have diabe-
tes or sugar diabetes? 2) Are you taking
insulin now? 3) Are you taking diabetes
pills to lower your blood glucose?
Insulin resistance was estimated using
the homeostatic model assessment for in-
sulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by the following
formula: (fasting serum insulin [mU/mL] 3
fasting plasma glucose [mg/dL])/405
(25). HOMA-IR correlates well with data
using the hyperglycemic clamp technique
(25,26), which is recognized to be the gold
standard for measuring insulin resistance.
Insulin sensitivity has been defined by the
World Health Organization (WHO) as
values below the highest quartile of the
HOMA-IR index, as measured in subjects
without diabetes (27). For this analysis,
subjects in the highest quartile will be
categorized as insulin resistant.
A fasting blood glucose test was per-
formed on eligible participants who were
examined in the morning session after a 9-h
fast. Since an oral glucose tolerance test was
added to the laboratory protocol in
NHANES 2005­2006, the 2-h postload
values (after a dose of 75 g of glucose)
will be included in this analysis. Plasma
glucose was measured using an enzyme
hexokinase method for NHANES 2001­
2006 surveys, and the 2005­2006 values
(Hitachi 911) were corrected to the 2003­
2004 values using the Roche Cobas Mira
method. There were changes to the equip-
ment and laboratory from NHANES
2003­2004. For NHANES 2005­2006,
glucose and insulin measurements were
performed by the Fairview Medical Center
Laboratory at the University of Minnesota
(Minneapolis, MN), and for NHANES
2003­2004, glucose and insulin measure-
ments were performed by the Diabetes Di-
agnostic Laboratory at the University of
Missouri (Columbia, MO). Insulin was
measured using the Tosoh AIA-PACK
IRI immunoenzymometric assay in
NHANES 2003­2004 and the Merocodia
Insulin ELISA immunoassay in NHANES
2005­2006. A1C measurements were ob-
tained using a high-performance liquid
chromatography system. The Boronate
Affinity high-performance liquid chro-
matography system determines total
glycohemoglobin by measuring the 1,2-cis
diol group found in A1C.
Covariates
Age, race/ethnicity, sex, education, season
of examination, physical activity, and
smoking were obtained by self-report. Sea-
son was assigned as winter if the period of
examination was between 1 November and
30 April or summer if between 1 May and
31 October. The average level of physical
activity was reported on a scale of 1­4 (least
vigorous to most vigorous). Participants
were asked whether they had smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in their entire life to clas-
sify their smoking status. Those who an-
swered "yes" were asked whether they
now smoke cigarettes every day, some
days, or not at all. Current smokers were
those who had smoked at least 100 ciga-
rettes during their lifetime and, at the time
of the interview, reported smoking either
every day or some days. Former smokers
were those who reported smoking at least
100 cigarettes during their lifetime but cur-
rently did not smoke. Never smokers were
those who reported never having smoked
100 cigarettes during their lifetime. Data on
anthropometric measurements were ob-
tained by health staff (28). BMI was calcu-
lated from measured weight and height
according to a standardized protocol. For
adults aged 20 years or older, normal
weight was defined as a BMI of 18.5­
24.99 kg/m2, overweight was defined as a
BMI of 25.0­29.99 kg/m2, and obesity as a
BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 or higher. These defini-
tions are consistent with those of the Na-
tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and
the WHO (29,30). For multiple regression
analysis, underweight adults will not be in-
cluded because they comprise a small pro-
portion of the sample (;2%). Waist
circumference (WC) may correlate better
with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes
because it is a better measure of body fat.
Abdominal obesity was defined as WC
$102 cm for men and $88 cm for women
(31). WC was measured at a point imme-
diately above the iliac crest on the midaxil-
lary line at minimal respiration to the
nearest 0.1 cm (32).
Inclusion criteria
A small number of participants (n = 900,
6.2%) .20 years of age who were inter-
viewed and examined in a MEC did not
have data on serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tion. Among the adults in this sample, all
were eligible for the type 2 diabetes analysis,
butonly the participantsrandomly assigned
to the morning session (n = 7,068, 51.8%)
after an overnight fast were included in the
insulin resistance analysis. The sample for
the diabetes analysis had missing informa-
tion for physical activity (n = 15, 0.11%),
smoking status (n = 15, 0.12%), education
(n = 17, 0.12%), BMI (n = 401, 2.9%), and
WC (n = 590, 4.3%). However, the sample
for the insulin resistance analysis was
smaller and had missing information for
physical activity (n = 10, 0.15%), smoking
status (n = 8, 0.12%), education (n = 9,
0.14%), BMI (n = 170, 2.5%), and WC
(n = 253, 3.9%). After excluding persons

with missing information for covariates, the
sample for the diabetes analysis comprised
n = 12,900 individuals, and the sample for
theinsulinresistance analysis comprised n =
5,806 individuals. The flowchart of the ex-
cluded participants along with the reason is
summarized in Fig. 1.
Statistical analysis
SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used
for all calculations and analyses. Given the
complex, stratified, multistage probability
cluster sampling structure used in the
NHANES survey design, data were ana-
lyzed using the SAS survey procedures.
These include weight, cluster, and strata
statements, which allow for the calculation
of unbiased population-based estimates
that reflect the unequal probability of
selection, nonresponse adjustment, and
adjustment to independent population con-
trols. Since data from NHANES 2001­
2006 were used for this analysis, 6-year
sample weights were used to produce
statistically reliable estimates, taking into
account the complex survey design.
Differences in continuous variables
were tested using a Student t test, and
differences in categorical variables were
assessed using a Pearson x2 test. The
reported means, standard errors, and pro-
portions take into account NHANES design
methodology. The association between
25(OH)D status (sufficient [20­50 ng/mL]
or insufficient [,20 ng/mL]) and type 2 di-
abetes or insulin resistance was determined
using multiple logistic regression. The re-
sults were stratified by BMI (overweight
and obese versus normal, obese versus nor-
mal, or overweight versus normal) or WC
(abdominally obese vs. not abdominally
obese) and adjusted for age (continuous),
sex (male or female), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexi-
can American, or other), education level
(lessthanhighschool,high schooldiploma,
or some college education), seasonofexam-
ination (winter or summer), physical
activity (continuous), and smoking status
(never smoker, former smoker, or current
smoker). Furthermore, the reference group
in all models was sufficient 25(OH)D
(20­50 ng/mL) and normal weight
(BMI = 18.5­24.99 kg/m2) or not abdom-
inally obese (WC ,102 cm for men and
,88 cm for women). A cross-product in-
teraction term was included in the logistic
regression model to assess multiplicative
interaction. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
CIs were calculated using the contrast
statement in SAS 9.2. Variance was calcu-
lated using the Taylor series linearization
method, which leads to an asymptotically
unbiased estimate.
The expected interaction on the multi-
plicative and additive scale was also calcu-
lated. It has been argued that interaction on
the additive scale better reflects biologic
interaction (33). To assess additive interac-
tion, the relative excess risk due to interac-
tion(RERI) and attributable proportiondue
to interaction (AP) were calculated (34). In

Effects of obesity and vitamin D on glucose homeostasis
the absence of additive interaction, RERI
and AP are equal to 0 (33).
RESULTSdTable 1 displays the charac-
teristics of the participants .20 years of age
from NHANES 2001­2006 in the analytic
sample separated by diabetes and insulin
resistance status. Individuals with diabetes
or insulin resistance were more likely to be
overweight or obese compared with those
without diabetes or insulin-sensitive indi-
viduals. The proportion of 25(OH)D suffi-
ciency was higher for individuals without
diabetes and insulin-sensitive individuals.
Smoking status was marginally different
across the insulin-sensitive and insulin-
resistant groups but was retained in the
multiple regression models for adjust-
ment. Individuals with diabetes and insu-
lin resistance were more likely to be older,
male, non-Hispanic black and Mexican
American, a former smoker, less educated,
and less physically active than participants
without diabetes.
Insulin resistance
Results from the multiple logistic regression
models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity,
education level, season of examination,
physical activity, and smoking status are
shown in Table 2. The results are presented
to assess interaction using a joint effects
method, with the P value of the interaction
term indicating statistical significance of
multiplicative interaction. Obese individu-
als with insufficient vitamin D had a signif-
icantly increased risk of insulin resistance
compared with normal-weight individuals
with sufficient vitamin D (OR 32.13 [95%
CI 22.49­45.89]). In addition, overweight,
overweight and obese, and abdominally
obese individuals had a significantly higher
risk of insulin resistance compared with the
reference group. However, there was no ev-
idence of multiplicative interaction of

25(OH)D and general obesity on increasing
the risk of insulin resistance (P = 0.44).
RERI and AP were calculated as mea-
sures of additive interaction and presented
in Table 3. There is strong additive interac-
tion between abdominal obesity and insuf-
ficient 25(OH)D (RERI 6.45 [95% CI
1.03­11.52]). In other words, the OR of
being insulin resistant in abdominally
obese adults who have insufficient
25(OH)D is 6.45 times higher as a result
of the additive interaction between obesity
and insufficient 25(OH)D.
Type 2 diabetes
Obese individuals with insufficient vitamin
D had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
compared with the reference group (OR
6.78 [95% CI 4.54­10.12]). In addition,
overweight, overweight and obese, and ab-
dominally obese individuals had a signifi-
cantly higher risk of type 2 diabetes
compared with the reference group. There
was no evidence of multiplicative interac-
tion of insufficient 25(OH)D and general
obesity on increasing the risk of type 2
diabetes (P = 0.65).
RERIs derived from the relation with
type 2 diabetes were significantly lower
than those derived from the relation with
insulinresistance.ThehighestRERIfortype2
diabetes was observed for obesity and
vitamin D insufficiency. None of the RERI
or AP values were statistically significant in
the type 2 diabetes analysis. In addition, AP
was lower in the diabetes analysis as com-
pared with the insulin resistance analysis.
CONCLUSIONSdIn a large, nation-
ally representative sample of adults .20
years of age, we found evidence that being
overweight or obese modified the associa-
tions of 25(OH)D with insulin resistance.
The magnitude of the effect modification
was large; for example, obese individuals
with low 25(OH)D had 32.13 times the
risk for insulin resistance, which was still
much higher than the 19.97-fold increase
among obese individuals with sufficient
25(OH)D. No statistically significant ad-
ditive interaction was found in regard

Effects of obesity and vitamin D on glucose homeostasis
to diabetes. The stronger interaction
of 25(OH)D with obesity in regard to in-
sulin resistance as compared with diabetes
may be related to the direct impact of
vitamin D deficiency on insulin resistance.
Animal and in vitro studies provide
evidence that vitamin D indirectly im-
pacts diabetes through insulin resistance,
which may explain the weaker additive
interaction (4).
We believe that our results are biolog-
ically plausible. Evidence for deposition of
fat-soluble vitamin D in adipose tissues
(14,18) may explain the joint effect of vita-
min D insufficiency and obesity on increas-
ing risk of insulin resistance. Abdominal
obesity is more highly correlated with the
presence of adipose tissue than general
obesity, which provides a rationale for the
differences in additive interaction. The
storage of vitamin D in fat tissues can result
in lower vitamin D bioavailability for influ-
encingpancreaticb-cell function oractivat-
ing vitamin D receptors, thereby increasing
the risk of adverse glycemic outcomes (5).
In addition, the presence of a vitamin D
response element in the insulin gene pro-
moter is another potential mechanism for
the observed interaction (35).
Although our study features a large,
nationally representative sample that en-
hances generalizability, a limitation of this
study is its cross-sectional nature. Informa-
tion on vitamin D, obesity, insulin resis-
tance, and diabetes was collected at the
same point in time, so temporality is not
assured. However, cohort studies with
longitudinal follow-up have shown that
obesity is a risk factor for low 25(OH)D
concentration (16) and insulin resistance/
diabetes (1,2,4), which supports a tempo-
ral link for the observed interaction. Al-
though not adjusting for geographic
region may be a potential limitation in
this study, because data are collected in
the south during the winter and north dur-
ing the summer, adjustment for season
would also take into account some of the
geographic variation. On a separate note,
use of the OR may overestimate the risk
ratio when assessing additive interaction
for an outcome as common as type 2 di-
abetes. But a simulation study has shown
that AP is the most robust to direct substi-
tution of the OR for risk ratio (36). Finally,
a sensitivity analysis was conducted with
undiagnosed cases so that participants
who were under treatment with pharma-
cological agents (insulin or oral antidia-
betes pills) and physician-diagnosed cases
of diabetes were excluded, but the overall
results were similar.
The results of this study are consistent
with those reported by two other studies.
Hyppönen and Power (15) found that
among obese participants, there was a
stronger association between serum
25(OH)D concentration and A1C com-
pared with normal-weight patients. Ou
et al. (19) reported a stronger association
between serum 25(OH)D concentration
and insulin sensitivity in overweight indi-
viduals compared with normal-weight indi-
viduals. However, it is difficult to generalize
the results of Ou et al. due to the limited age
range and racial diversity and the fact that
the participants in the study were not obese.
Furthermore, Ou et al. defined obesity with
different cut points than what is conven-
tionally accepted. In contrast, the current
study used standard definitions of weight
categories (using both BMI and WC cut
points) (30,31), vitamin D status based on
serum 25(OH)D concentration (3), insulin
resistance (27), and type 2 diabetes diag-
nosis (24) based on laboratory reports.
Although our study is a cross-sectional
observational study, we believe that our
results have large public health significance.
In fully adjusted models, we estimated that
47% of the cases of insulin resistance can be
explained by interaction between low
25(OH)D and high BMI. This statistical
evidence supports the notion that the
burden of insulin resistance in obese in-
dividuals may be reduced by making
improvements in serum 25(OH)D concen-
tration. Given the difficulty in management
of overweight or obese status in certain
individuals (37), recommendations to im-
prove vitamin D status may be an inexpen-
sive and practical means of reducing the
burden of diabetes. Indeed, it was found
in a meta-analysis that vitamin D supple-
mentation reduced the risk of type 2 diabe-
tes (2) and improved insulin resistance
(38,39) to a small extent. Future random-
ized, controlled trials should focus on the
impact of vitamin D supplementation
among obese individuals. If results are pos-
itive, vitamin D may be an avenue for obese
individualstoimproveglucosehomeostasis.
