Summary
Genetic data collected during the second phase of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) enable us to investigate the association of a wide variety of health factors with regard to genetic variation.
The classic question when looking into the genetic variations in a population is whether the population is in the state
of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Our objective was to develop test procedures using family data from complex
surveys such as NHANES III. We developed six Pearson 2 based tests for a diallelic locus of autosomal genes. The finite
sample properties of the proposed test procedures were evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation studies and the Rao-Scott
first order corrected test was recommended. Test procedures were applied to three loci from NHANES III genetic
databases, i.e., ADRB2, TGFB1, and VDR. HWE was shown to hold at 0.05 level for all three loci when only families
with genotypic information available for two parents and for one or more children were used in the analysis.

Introduction
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), conducted periodically since 1960 by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has pro-
vided national estimates of the health and nutritional status
of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population. The
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) began in the fall of 1988 and ended in the
fall of 1994. During the second phase of NHANES III (from
October, 1991 to October, 1994), blood lymphocytes were
collected from 7159 participants aged 12 years and older in
anticipation of advances in genetic research. Linkage of the
NHANES III phenotype data with this genetic information
provides the opportunity to investigate the association of a
wide variety of health factors with regard to genetic varia-
tions (NCHS, 2007).

National surveys like NHANES III employ a complex,
multistage, probability sampling design to select participants
representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US popu-
lation. At the first stage of the sampling, the target population
is partitioned into primary sampling units (PSU), e.g., coun-
ties. The PSUs are then grouped into strata. Within each
stratum, PSUs are sampled often with probability propor-
tional to the population size. At the next stage,the sampled
PSUs are subdivided into smaller geographic units, such as
city blocks, and a random sample of these units are selected.
Additional stages of sampling may be used where smaller units
are sampled from the sampled units at the second stage. At
the last stage of sampling, individuals are sampled from the
sampled units. For each individual, the inverse of the product
of the selection probabilities across all of the stages of sampling
is their sample weight.
A complex sampling plan adds at least two complexities to
the data analyses. First, cluster sampling may induce correla-
tion between individual observations within sampled clusters.
The standard errors can be underestimated if this correlation is
ignored. Second, varying selection probabilities used to sam-
ple individuals produce different sample weights for surveyed
subjects. If these sample weights are correlated with the ob-
servations then an analysis that does not take this into account

can be biased (Korn & Graubard, 1999). Test procedures de-
veloped for simple random samples are generally unsuitable
for the analysis of data from these complex sample designs.
The classic question when looking into the genetic varia-
tions in a population is whether the population is in the state
of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), which has been a
powerful research tool ever since its discovery in the early
1900s (e.g., Haseman & Elston, 1972; Crow, 1988; Neilsen
et al., 1999; Xu et al., 2002; Lee, 2003). Various tests for
departure from HWE have been proposed under different
settings (e.g., Li, 1955; Hern´
andez & Weir, 1989; Olson &
Foley, 1996; Chen & Thomson, 1999; Neilsen et al., 1999;
Lee, 2003; Weinberg & Morris, 2003; Bourgain et al., 2004;
Schaid et al., 2006; Li & Li, 2008).
The analysis of family data for HWE has been proposed
by Bourgain et al. (2004) in the setting of random samples.
Li & Graubard proposed using Wald-like tests for HWE in
a complex survey setting assuming that all individuals were
independent (Li & Graubard, 2008). Our objective was to
develop procedures for testing departure from HWE using
family data in a complex survey setting. Our methods differ
from that of Bourgain et al. (2004) in that our methods were
developed for complex survey samples while Bourgain et al.
developed their method for random samples, though both of
the methods deal with family data. The family structure was
ignored by Li and Graubard (2008), which was taken into
consideration when we developed our test procedures.
Methods
Surveys with a complex sampling plan, such as NHANES III,
often have a multi-stage design. At the first stage of the sam-
pling, the target population is partitioned into primary sampling
units (PSU). The PSUs are then grouped into strata. Within each
stratum, some numbers of PSUs are sampled. Later, individuals
or households with different weights are sampled from PSUs. Li
pointed out that the effect of pooling random mating subgroups
with different allele frequencies is equivalent to that of inbreed-
ing in the total population (Li, 1969). Therefore, for stratified
sampling data, the first step of testing HWE is to test the homo-
geneity across all stratified subgroups. Our work is restricted to
the situation that all stratified subgroups are homogeneous, i.e.,
no population substructure exists.
In a simple random sampling setting, assuming a diallelic locus
(i.e., A and a) of autosomal genes, there are 27 possible genotype
combinations among father, mother, and child. When the mating
orders of father and mother do not need to be distinguished,
these 27 combinations reduce to ten possibilities. Let p be the
frequency of allele A and q = 1-p be the frequency of allele a.
Assuming HWE, the joint genotype distribution of parents-child
triads are given in Table 1.
We consider K families with two parents and one child and
assume families are independent of each other. Let n = (n1, n2, n3,
n4, n5, n6, n7, n8, n9, n10)T be the vector denoting the number of

i=1
ni is the total number
of families. The null hypothesis of interest, denoted by H0, is
that HWE holds in the population. If H0 holds, then n has a
multinomial distribution with parameter vector (K; (p)), where
(p) = (p4, 2p3q, 2p3q, 2p2q2, p2q2, 2p2q2, p2q2, 2pq3, 2pq3, q4).
Departure from HWE can be tested using Pearson chi-square
test statistics given by:
2

p)(n, ^
p),
where ^
p = (4n1

(n, ^
p) = (n - ( ^

ilies minus the estimated expected number of families in each
category, and

Graubard, 2008).
Simulation Studies
The type I error rate and power of all proposed test procedures
under complex multistage sampling frames were evaluated via
Monte Carlo simulations with a nominal level of 0.05. The fol-
lowing parameters were controlled in the same manner used by
Li and Graubard (2008): 1) H, the number of strata; 2) L, the
number of sampled PSUs per stratum; 3) m, the number of sam-
pled parents-child triads per PSU per stratum; and 4) w, the
weight assigned to each parent-child triad. In addition to these
parameters, we also controlled 1) F, the inbreeding coefficient
for population substructure or cryptic relatedness; and 2) p, the
frequency of allele A.
We set H to 23 and L to 2, which reflect the design of the
second phase of NHANES III, for all simulation studies. The
type I error rate and power were evaluated at three different m
levels (60, 120, and 180) with allele A frequency of 0.1, 0.3,
or 0.5. Two different sets of sample weights are considered, i.e.,
no weighting, where wr 's are equal to one or wr 's are randomly
assigned the values {1,3,5}, in our simulations. The weight of
each family was the average weight of each parents-child triad.
The inbreeding coefficient was set to 0, 0.01, 0.02, or 0.05.
Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium was induced by the
parental allele correlation among each stratum per PSU
(Devlin & Roeder, 1999; Zheng et al., 2005). Genotype data for
each parents-child triad can be generated using a two-step proce-
dure. In step 1, the allele A frequency pA was generated from the
Beta distribution Beta((1-F)p/F, (1-F)(1-p)/F) when F = 0.
When F = 0, pA takes p. In step 2, for each parent, two alleles
were drawn at random from the binomial distribution Bin(2, pA).
Given parental genotypes, the genotype of a child was randomly
generated according to Mendelian law.
Results
Simulation Studies
The type I error rates and power of all proposed test proce-
dures were estimated from the simulations by the proportion
of rejections of the null hypothesis at the nominal level of
0.05 in 1000 independent replications.
The type I error rates at three different m levels, i.e., 60,
120, and 180, were similar, so only the results for m = 60
were presented in Table 2. The first order corrected test (with
test statistic 2
A,W
(1)) has type I error rates closest to the
nominal one, which vary from 0.048 to 0.066. The other
two corrections (with test statistics 2
A,W
(2) and F2
A,W
(2))
are conservative, and they have type I error rates uniformly
lower than the first order corrected test. Applying the methods
proposed by Li and Graubard (2008) to the simulated data, we
find that the F-version of the Wald test has type I error rates
closest to the nominal level but is slightly anti-conservative
for p = 0.1 and sample weights from {1,3,5} with p-value

test performed best in the simulation situations.
We evaluated the power properties of the proposed methods
at three different m levels (60, 120, and 180) for each F. The
larger m was, the greater power was achieved. However, only
the power for m = 60 is given in Table 3. The 2
A,W
(1) test
achieved very little power for F = 0.01. When F increased
from 0.01 to 0.02, the power achieved by the 2
A,W
(1) test
was more than doubled. When F was set to 0.05, the power
achieved by the 2
A,W
(1) test was more than 90%. The F-
version of the Wald test proposed by Li and Graubard (2008)
achieves powers similar to those of the 2
A,W
(1) test.
Real Data Analysis
To illustrate our methods, we have analyzed three candidate
loci from the NHANES III genetic data base. The three
loci are ADRB2 (rs1042713), TGFB1 (rs1982073), and VDR
(rs2239185). Variances are estimated using pseudo-strata and
pseudo-PSUs supplied by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
NHANES III does not provide sample weight for each family.
Instead, it supplies sample weight for each participant. Sample
weight of each family is computed as the average sample
weight of individuals from the family. For example, for a
family of three members, the sample weight for that family
would be the sum of sample weights of the three family
members divided by three.
A total of 7159 individuals aged 12 years and older partic-
ipated in the second phase of NHANES III in anticipation
of advances in genetic research. Out of the 7159 partici-
pants, 6930 individuals have genotype information available
for ADRB2, 6920 for TGFB1, and 6794 for VDR. The num-
bers of families with parental genotypic information available
for ADRB2, TGFB1, and VDR are 900, 901, and 861 respec-
tively. Of these, only 138 families have genotypic information
available for at least one child for ADRB2, 145 families for
TGFB1, and 128 families for VDR.
The first analysis was restricted to families with genotypic
information available for two parents and for at least one child.
For families with more than one child, we randomly selected
one child for the analysis. In addition, we did a sensitivity anal-
ysis by using all families with genotypic information available
for two parents. For those families without genotypic infor-
mation for any children, we randomly generated one child
per family based on the parental genotypes using Mendelian
law. The above analyses were replicated 1000 times to get the
mean p-values for each proposed method.
Table 4 gives the p-values of all proposed tests for HWE
for each of the three loci. HWE holds for all three loci if we
restricted the analysis to families with genotypic information
available for two parents and at least one child. When all
families with genotypic information available for two parents

Discussion and Conclusion
We developed six test procedures based on the Pearson 2
statistic for complex sampling settings. The six Pearson 2
statistic based test statistics are 1) the weighted version of
chi-square test statistic 2
A,W
; 2) the Rao-Scott first order
adjusted test statistic 2
A,W
(1); 3) the Satterthwaite second
order adjusted test statistic 2
A,W
(2); 4) the F-version statistic
F2
A,W
(2) of 2
A,W
(2); 5) the Wald test statistic 2
A,Wald
; and
6) the F-version statistic F A,Wald of 2
A,Wald
.
Properties of proposed test procedures were evaluated via
Monte Carlo simulations. The first order corrected test main-
tained type I error rates closest to the nominal level for all three
chosen allele A frequencies. It achieved little power when F,
the inbreeding coefficient, was 0.01. The power achieved
by the first order corrected test exceeded 90% when F was
set 0.05. Among all the tests developed by Li and Graubard
(2008), which assumed that all individuals were independent
of each other, the F-version of the Wald test had type I er-
ror rates closest to the nominal level but could be slightly
anti-conservative.
Under the null hypothesis, father and mother are indepen-
dent so the methods developed by Li and Graubard (2008) are
valid for parental data. Our simulation results (not presented
in this paper) show that the F-version of the Wald test had
well-controlled type I error rates while other tests had inflated
type I error rates for some occasions. In this analysis, the F-
version of the Wald test achieved uniformly less power than
our proposed 2
A,W
(1) test applied to parents-child triads.
The proposed method is based on the data of parents-child
triads. It can be extended to the situation when data for more
than one offspring per family are available. The key is to find
the joint genotype distribution of parents and children, which
is much more complicated and deserves further investigation,
and to apply the same principle as described in this paper.
The proposed test procedures were applied to NHANES
III data and the results presented here are applicable to the U.S.
civilian, non-institutionalized population of age 12 and older,
from which the data were collected. The analysis showed that
HWE held at the 0.05 level for all three loci if the analyses
were restricted to those families with genotypic information
available for both two parents and at least one child. When all
families with genotypic information available for two parents
were used for the analyses, we randomly generated a child
genotype using Mendelian law for those families who did not
have a child genotype but did have parental genotypes. In this
situation, HWE only holds for ADRB2 and TGFB1 (nominal
level is 0.05).
Results relating to VDR from the two analyses do not agree
with each other for two possible reasons. First, in the studied
data, the number of families with genotypes for both parents
and at least one child is relatively small compared with the
total family number. For example, there are 861 families with
genotypic information about VDR available for two parents,
of which only 128 families have genotypic information about
VDR for at least one child. Secondly, the distributions of
parental genotypes of families with children are quite different
from those of families without children. For example, for
VDR, 3.9% of families with children have parental genotype
of `CC-CC' while 9.4% of families without children have
this parental genotype; this would result in different joint
distributions of three genotypes from parents-child triads and
contribute at least partially to the different results from the
analyses.
In summary, we recommend the use of the Rao-Scott first
order corrected test in surveys like NHANES III.
