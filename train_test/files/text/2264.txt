The price of access: capitalization of
neighborhood contextual factors
Henry Shelton Brown III1* and Lisa M Yarnell2
Abstract
Background: Studies of neighborhood context on health behavior have not considered that the health benefits of
context may be `capitalized' into, or included in, higher housing values. This study examines the associations of better
neighborhood context with neighborhood housing values.
Methods: We use the third wave of Add Health (2000-2001) to estimate the association of neighborhood contextual
variables and housing values first across then within income types. This is a census block group-level analysis.
Results: We find that neighborhood context, especially access to fruit and vegetable outlets, is capitalized into, or
associated with, higher housing values. Fast food and convenience store access are associated with lower housing
values. Capitalization differs by income quartile of the neighborhood. Even those in the poorest neighborhoods value
access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and those in the wealthier neighborhoods value activity resources. All
neighborhood incomes types place negative value on fast food access and convenience store access.
Conclusions: Access to health-related contextual attributes is capitalized into higher housing prices. Access to fresh
fruits and vegetables is valued in neighborhoods of all income levels. Modeling these associations by neighborhood
income levels helps explain the mixed results in the literature on the built environment in terms of linking health
outcomes to access.
Background
Neighborhood context, defined as the physical and social
attributes of a neighborhood, is correlated with health [1].
For instance, better relative access to healthy food and
physical activity (PA) resources within a neighborhood
is associated with lower body weight at the individual
level. This is likely because better access lowers the time
required to access healthy food and PA [2-6]. However
in most neighborhood context studies, the association
between health effects and context are estimated assum-
ing that locational decisions by individuals are random,
which leads to bias [7,8]. An important and helpful theory
from urban economics has been ignored in this literature:
the possibility that the health benefits of local access to
healthy food/PA, and of better neighborhoods generally,
may be capitalized into, or included in, higher hous-
ing values. Likewise, proximity to health-compromising

features, such as fast food outlets, may be negatively
capitalized, or discounted in terms of housing values
or rent.
Capitalization can be thought of as evidence of pref-
erence, at the aggregate level, for a given neighborhood
and its attributes as compared to alternative neighbor-
hoods. Housing price models are bid models. For instance,
if a neighborhood acquires an attribute, like a redevel-
oped waterfront, its increased desirability will encourage
higher bids for the homes in that neighborhood, leading to
higher costs for buyers to live there. With capitalization,
`premiums,' or the portion of the housing price which is
attributable to that locational feature, may be required for
access. Homes can also be `discounted' (receive a negative
premium) for features negatively related to health, indicat-
ing underlying preferences for health by those willing to
pay for access.
It is acknowledged that income and health are highly
correlated [1]. The paradox is that if access to "better"
neighborhood contextual factors is capitalized, income,
net of housing costs, will be reduced, which might lower

health outcomes. Therefore, the overall effects of con-
textual factors on health is ambiguous. Further, if neigh-
borhood contextual factors are shown to be capitalized,
this demonstrates the extent to which locational decisions
are not random. Neither issue has been given sufficient
attention in the contextual factor literature.
Two economic theories suggest that housing markets
capitalize the benefits of neighborhood features. First, von
Thünen theorized in the early 19th century that land val-
ues are a function of the local area's attributes, particularly,
access to the center of the city, rather than the intrinsic
value of the property in isolation [9]. Second, the Tiebout
model of the 1950's asserted that people sort themselves
among localities in order to find their utility-maximizing
mix of government services, many of which affect health,
and local taxes [10]. Thus, people with similar tastes and
similar norms, including `like-mindedness' over health
issues, are likely to sort together.
Empirically, `hedonic' price models have been used to
estimate the level of capitalization of local attributes and
amenities. For example, if two identical houses on two
identical lots in different areas of town are priced differ-
ently, differential local contextual factors, like schools or
crime level, may explain the difference in price or capital-
ization. Hedonic models have been used to estimate the
capitalization of better local schools [11], of relative crime
avoidance [12], and of relative environmental advantages
such as clean air [13]. However, studies of capitalization in
the neighborhood context literature do not exist.
We address this gap in the literature by estimating
the association of neighborhood contextual variables­
particularly, health-related neighborhood contextual
variables­and housing values, using the third wave of
data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health), reflecting the years 2000-2001. In
our hedonic regressions of housing values by income
quartile, we demonstrate that health-related attributes
such as supermarket density are capitalized.
Neighborhood context and health
Health-related neighborhood attributes have received
particular attention in sociological and economic litera-
ture as correlates of health, yet, as mentioned, have not
been investigated explicitly in models of housing capi-
talization. For instance, access to healthy food has been
linked to better diets and lower obesity rates. There is
extensive literature documenting that poorer and ethnic
minority neighborhoods have fewer supermarkets per
household [14-23]. Supermarkets often provide higher
quality food products and offer lower food prices than
other food outlets [22,24]. Increased availability of chain
supermarkets is significantly associated with lower ado-
lescent BMI and overweight, while greater availability of
convenience stores is significantly associated with higher
adolescent BMI and overweight [23]. According to Powell
et al. (2007), the link between supermarket availability and
weight is often indirect, with studies often simply demon-
strating that availability is associated with consumption
[25], or that availability is associated with diet quality [26].
There is also extensive literature documenting that par-
ticular physical environments are positively associated
with PA levels [4-6]. Neighborhoods with higher income
and lower poverty have more of certain PA outlets, includ-
ing parks and bike path lanes (though not more public
pools or beaches) [27]. Lower income individuals are more
likely to perceive limitations to PA in their neighborhoods,
including safety, gangs, traffic, and affordability [27,28].
Regular PA, in turn, is associated with reduced obesity
[27,29].
The bid model
The von Thünen bid model can be illustrated as follows.
Suppose everyone living in the urban space must travel
downtown for work. Commute times vary by location of
residence, and people place different values on time, and
that value is correlated with wages. Suppose that a person
values time at $10 an hour, and would save 20 hours per
month commuting downtown for work by moving from
his current location to location X. What would he bid for
the move? He would bid up to $200 ($10 times 20 hours)
more than his current location. This may be enough to
displace the person currently at location X, who may place
a lower value on time. Alternatively, the person at location
X may match the higher bid. According to the bid model,
people bid and sort until an equilibrium emerges, where
no one is induced to outbid people at other locations.
Note that not everyone must move for the equilibrium to
emerge.
All else equal, land rents or prices tend to increase
towards the center of the city because of lowered com-
mute time costs.1 This equilibrium pattern of rental and
land prices is called a rental gradient. Rental gradients
can also shift up or down because of characteristics other
than time needed to travel to a nearby location. These
include local area crime, pollution, school quality, etc. For
instance, if crime avoidance is valued by the potential
mover in the previous paragraph, he would bid less than
$200 if location X has higher crime than his current loca-
tion. If crime is lower at location X, he would bid more
than $200. Note that the process of valuation is subjec-
tive, such as with the perceived threat of crime. Note also
that rents and prices for homes are highly correlated, spa-
tially; there are few places with high housing rents and low
housing prices.
Note that income limits the ability to bid, regardless of
preference for a local attribute. For instance, low-income
people may highly value education for their children, but
not be able to afford to live in areas with the very best
Brown and Yarnell International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2013, 10:95 Page 3 of 11

schools. However, qualities such as crime level and school
quality are reflected by a range of levels, rather than in
binary variables. Therefore, low-income families may be
willing, and able, to pay more to live in a location with
average schools rather than living in an area with worse
schools.
In this paper, we apply von Thünen's bid model by test-
ing whether access to local food and PA amenities that are
positively related to health are shown to be valued pos-
itively in terms of housing prices, i.e., whether they are
associated with an upward shift in the gradient, and by
how much; and whether amenities negatively related to
health are valued negatively in terms of housing prices.
Because poorer people are likely to be outbid for access to
locations with the absolute best access to healthy food and
PA amenities, we stratify our analysis by income level of
the neighborhood.
Methods
Data
Our data are from the third wave of data from the Add
Health data set, a longitudinal study based on a nationally
representative sample of adolescents in the United States,
initially drawn in the 1994-1995 school year. In our study,
we utilize data from Wave III of Add Health, in which
a majority (73.13%) of the original Wave I respondents
were re-interviewed between August 2001 and April 2002,
when these participants were between 18 and 26 years old
[30]. We would have liked to have taken advantage of the
full panel of Add Health data. However, our capitalization
and neighborhood context measures were only available
at Wave III.
We chose the Add Health data set for this analysis
for several reasons. Most important, the neighborhood
amenities in the Add Health data are counted with respect
to a distance, either straight line or street network, from
an individual's residence, at one of four levels: block
group, tract, county, or state. We chose the block group
level (keeping only one observation, randomly chosen, per
block group); and used the street network distance, based
on an 8 kilometer search, for the counts. A block group is
defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census as a "subdivision
of a census tract . . . [and] the smallest geographic unit for
which the census bureau tabulates sample data. A block
group consists of all the blocks within a census tract with
the same beginning number" [31]. Block groups average
about 1,000 inhabitants.
U.S. Census data also counts amenities such as super-
markets and fast food outlets at the block group level.
However, it does not base its counts on street network
distances from each individual's residence, but rather
presents counts in summative fashion for the block group
as a whole, regardless of the location of individual's res-
idences within that block group. Hence, the Add Health
data, while used here at the neighborhood level only, is
inherently individual-focused. Measuring counts based on
travelable streets ties in directly with the von Thünen bid
model, reflecting the time and effort a resident would
practically spend to reach the desired neighborhood
amenity, such as a supermarket. In analyzing neighbor-
hoods or block groups rather than persons, we specified
school ID as the primary sampling unit, and specified
region as the strata variable, as indicated in Add Health
weighting instructions. We used Stata's subpopulation
weighting techniques when estimating models separately
by income quartile.
We also found that the Add Health data have good rep-
resentativeness in terms of sampling. Add Health's con-
textual data sample included low-population, rural areas
with as few as 1900 persons per county at Wave III. For
comparison, the American Community Survey (a yearly
counterpart to the decennial U.S. Census) is less repre-
sentative in terms of places represented in the data, being
based on a more restrictive standard of 20,000 or more
persons in a given area [31]. Additionally, the Add Health
data contain health outcome variables that, in a next stage
of this research, can be easily linked with the home values
and neighborhood amenities, to determine the influence
of these on health.
Finally, we chose to analyze data from earlier in the
2000s because this reflected a period just before the hous-
ing bubble, and then the subsequent housing crash [32].
Either event could bias attempts to correlate attributes
with housing values.
The use of the data has been approved by the Commit-
tee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University
of Texas Health Science Center.
Measures
Density
We based population density on a Wave III contextual
data item marking persons per square kilometer at the
block group level. This variable should be correlated with
distance to the urban center, making it essential in deter-
mining housing value in the von Thünen sense [9].
Per capita income
We based per capita income on a Wave III contextual data
item marking per capita income at the block group level.
In Tiebout models, similar people sort together [10], so
we would expect wealthier people to pay a premium to
live near other wealthy people. In addition to using this
item as a predictor of median housing value and rent, we
also used it to divide our sample into quartiles based on
block group per capita income. This was done using the
PROC RANK procedure in SAS. Dummy variables cre-
ated from this procedure (named `first' for the poorest,
`second', `third' and `fourth' for the wealthiest) were used
Brown and Yarnell International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2013, 10:95 Page 4 of 11
http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/10/1/95
as subpopulation markers for Stata's subpopulation com-
mand, which allowed us to estimate models separately by
income quartile group.
Median year built for housing units
We based median year that housing units in each block
group were built on a Wave III contextual data item rang-
ing from 1939 (reflecting a build year of 1939 or earlier) to
1999.
Median home value
We based median home value on a Wave III contextual
data item marking median home value of owner-occupied
housing units at the block group level, based on Census
2000 data. Medians were preferable because this value was
most representative of each block group, without undue
influence by markedly higher or lower home values for
a small number of blocks in the group. Utilizing values
for owner-occupied homes excluded homes for which the
owner would not be using its nearby amenities, such as
rental units, vacation homes, or seasonal residences.
In the original Add Health data, 95% of the home values
ranged from $16,700 to $935,700. A small number of cases
had values of less than $10,000 or greater than $1,000,000.
We eliminated cases that fell into these lower and higher
categories due to their extremity and the crude group-
ing of these cases in the Add Health data. This provided
us with a representative range of values without exces-
sive extremes, and with relatively precise measurement.
Finally, we divided these home values by 1,000 to yield a
variable with a scale that was reasonably matched with the
predictors, allowing for interpretable beta weights.
Densities of food and activity resources
We based Wave III densities of supermarkets, fast food
chain outlets, cooperative natural/health food stores,
convenience stores, fruit/vegetable markets, and activity
outlets on Wave III neighborhood resource data items
marking counts of these resources within eight-kilometer
network search units. Activity outlets included instruc-
tional facilities, membership facilities, outdoor facilities,
public fee facilities, parks, public facilities (such as
beaches and pools), schools, YMCAs, and youth organi-
zations (such as boy and girl scout organizations). These
resources had been categorized by Add Health staff
according to Dun and Bradstreet's 2001 primary Stan-
dard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and keyword
searches within the company name and trade style fields.
While the Dun & Bradstreet data have had their accuracy
questioned, recent literature has shown that the predic-
tive validity of the D&B food resource data is "good" and
comparable to competitor data such as from InfoUSA and
Department of Health and Environmental Control data
[33,34].
To convert counts into densities, we divided the counts
by Census tract population (a tract being a small, relatively
homogeneous subdivision of a county, larger than a block
group) [31]. To put the density values on a scale similar
to other variables in our models, we then multiplied these
values by 1,000.
Total crime
We based total crime on a Wave III item giving an index
of total crimes reported (as opposed to arrests made) per
100,000, at the county level.
Proportion college educated
We based proportion of persons with a college education
on a Wave III variable marking the proportion of persons
at the block group level who are 25 years or older and have
a bachelor's degree or more. In Tiebout models, similar
people sort together [10], so, as with income, we would
expect college-educated people to pay a premium to live
near similar people.
Region
Because real estate varies by region, we included dummy
variables (1=yes, 0=no) for whether the block group was
in the West, the Midwest or the South, with the Northeast
as the omitted variable.
Activity by crime interaction
Research has shown that in high-crime areas, parents are
more apprehensive about using parks and trails [35], and
value access less because they are seen as hosting criminal
activity [12]. Prior to modeling, we also created a Crime by
Activity Resource Density interaction term, having cen-
tered the Total Crime and Activity Resource Density vari-
ables prior to cross-multiplication. The interaction term
was included in all specifications of our model, along with
the centered versions of the component terms.
Analysis
Our initial sample consisted of 7,870 unique block groups.
Prior to analysis, we performed natural log transforma-
tions on the population density, activity density, and five
food outlet density variables in order to account for
the highly skewed nature of these variables. After these
transformations, all variables showed reasonable skew
statistics.
Next, we checked our data for outliers on the variables
to be used in our regression models. We applied a con-
servative 6.0 standard deviation cutoff for the removal of
outliers from our sample. Removal of cases with absolute
values of greater than 6.0 standard deviations from the
mean on one of more predictors reduced the sample to
N = 7,845, and removal of additional cases with extreme
values for home prices reduced the sample to its final size
of N = 7,817.

Our hedonic price model is of the form
Yb
= XHbb
+ XNb + ub, (1)
where Yb is the housing value for census block b, XHb are
health-related attributes of that location, including access
to food, etc., XNb are non-health-related attributes of that
location, including access to the center of the city (density)
and age of the housing stock. Finally, ub is the error term.
We estimated this model first across all block groups,
then separately by income quartile. As noted, we included
Median Income as a predictor in the model even when
running models separately by income quartile. Our rea-
soning is that even among income quartiles, there is still
significant variation on the Median Income variable. We
also ran models both with and without the natural/health
food and fruit/vegetable market density variables, rea-
soning that these variables could be collinear with the
supermarket density variable.
Results
Table 1 shows the means and proportions employed in our
analysis.
Table 2 shows the results for the hedonic regression
model for housing values estimated across all income
quartiles. As expected, block group level income is cor-
related with housing price, as is percentage of adults
aged 25 and older and with college education. This is in
accordance with predictions of the Tiebout model, where
wealthier people pay a premium to sort together.2 This
would as be predicted if there is a premium for prestige in
a neighborhood, or hard to observe benefits that accrue
from living near wealthier, educated people. All else equal,
housing costs more in the West and less in the South and
Midwest. Also as expected, the crime rate is negatively
associated with housing value, and block group level den-
sity is positively related to housing value. As mentioned
earlier, population density is a proxy measure for distance
to the center of the urban space in the von Thünen sense
[9]. The greater the density, the greater the housing price
because, typically, this is closer to the central city relative
to less dense areas, thus affording greater access.
In terms of health-related neighborhood contextual fac-
tors, most of the signs are as expected. Estimates for
fruit/vegetable market density (positive), fast food den-
sity (negative), and convenience store density (negative)
are significantly different from zero. Thus, neighborhood
contextual factors are capitalized. Elasticities are useful
in interpreting these coefficient estimates, particularly
when both the dependent and independent variables are
continuous. Elasticities measure the percentage change
in the dependent variable associated with a percentage
change in an independent variable. In the first model

model, 10 percent rise in the density of fruit and veg-
etable stores is associated with $2,907 higher home values
($3884 in 2012 dollars). On the other hand, people pay
a premium to the avoid convenience stores and fast food
chains. A 10 percent rise in the density of fast food
chains is associated with $625 lower home values ($824 in
2012 dollars).
Activity resource densities are not significantly related
to housing values in the first model. As mentioned,
research has shown that in high-crime areas, parks and
trails are not valued because they are seen as host sites
for criminal activity [12]. Therefore, we examined the
interaction between crime rate and activity resource den-
sity. However, the interaction term was not significantly
related to housing values in the first model.
In order to determine if supermarket density is posi-
tively associated with housing values when specialty food
stores are not controlled for, the model on the right in
Table 2 excludes natural food and fruit and vegetable store
densities. Supermarket density is significantly associated
with housing values when natural food and fruit and veg-
etable store densities are excluded. In this model, a 10
percent rise in the density of supermarkets is associated
with $792 higher home values ($1,059 in 2012 dollars).
Activity density is also significant when natural food and
fruit and vegetable store densities are excluded. A 10 per-
cent rise in activity densities is associated with $441 higher
home values ($590 in 2012 dollars).
Results by income quartile
Because tastes and preferences for access may differ by
income, we also estimated our hedonic regression model
separately by income quartile, with results shown in
Table 3. Supermarket density is valued amongst block
groups in the 1st (lowest) quartile of income when natural
food and fruit and vegetable store densities are excluded.
A 10 percent increase in supermarket density is asso-
ciated with $1,128 increased housing values in the 1st
quartile ($1,477 in 2012 dollars). People living in neigh-
borhoods in the 1st income quartile in terms of income
also value access to fruits and vegetable outlets, paying a
hefty premium to have access. A 10 percent increase in
fruit and vegetable store density is associated with $2,572
in increased housing values ($3,436 in 2012 dollars).
People living in neighborhoods in the 1st and 2nd quar-
tiles of income are willing to pay a small premium to avoid
fast food outlets. Results from the first model for quartile
two show that a 10 percent increase in access to fast food
restaurants (density) is associated with housing values that
are $358 lower ($479 in 2012 dollars).

Although people pay a premium to avoid crime in neigh-
borhoods in the 1st and 2nd quartiles of income, they are
not willing to pay a premium for access to PA resources.
As noted earlier, this may be due to the fact that in low-
income areas, parks are perceived as places for criminal
activity [12].
The lower half of Table 3 shows the results for cen-
sus blocks with incomes in the 3rd and 4th quartiles,
revealing some differences in comparison to the esti-
mates in the upper half of Table 3. Supermarket den-
sity is associated with housing price for the 4th quartile
of income when natural food and fruit and vegetable
store densities are excluded. A 10 percent increase in
supermarket density is associated with $1,473 ($1,966
in 2012 dollars). In the 3rd quartile, a 10 percent
increase in fruit and vegetable store density is associ-
ated with $2,789 higher housing costs ($3,727 in 2012
dollars).
The premium for avoiding convenience stores is incon-
sistent across neighborhoods by income quartile, but
there is a premium to avoid fast food in all models. For
instance, in the first specification of the 4th quartile model,
a 10 percent increase in access to fast food is associ-
ated with $1,302 in lower housing values ($1,740 in 2012
dollars).
Finally, wealthier neighborhoods also pay a higher pre-
mium for access to PA resources. In the full model for the
4th quartile, housing values are $1,635 higher ($2,184 in
2012 dollars) when activity resource density increases by
10 percent.
Discussion
That the price of nearly identical dwellings in differ-
ent neighborhoods can differ so dramatically reveals
disparities in locational attributes. Our analysis reveals
that physical attributes related to health are capital-
ized into higher housing values, i.e., it costs more to
live in those areas. Because the hedonic price model is
essentially a bid model, capitalization can be thought of
as evidence of preference, at the aggregate level, for a
given neighborhood and its attributes versus alternative
neighborhoods.
We found that access to fruit and vegetable stores
are highly capitalized. For instance, a 10 percent rise in
the density of fruit and vegetable stores, which could
be one store opening, is associated with $2,907 higher
home values ($3,884 in 2012 dollars). This result was
consistent across neighborhoods with different income
levels. Supermarket access was capitalized when vari-
ables for the densities of fruit and vegetable and natural
food stores were excluded. However, fruit and vegetable
store access always dominated supermarket access over-
all and across neighborhoods with different income
levels.
In some cases, attributes which are detrimental to health
are negatively capitalized, meaning housing values are dis-
counted in those areas. In our study, people valued the
avoidance of convenience stores and fast food chains. We
found that a 10 percent rise in the density of fast food
chains is associated with $625 lower home values ($884 in
2012 dollars).
We also found that capitalization varied by neigh-
borhood income levels. Wealthier neighborhoods pay a
higher premium for access to PA resources. Among neigh-
borhoods in the 4th quartile, housing values are $1,635
higher ($2,184 in 2012 dollars) when activity resource
density increases by 10 percent. Although people valued
PA resources overall, activity resources are not consis-
tently valued, especially among those with lower income.
This implies that projects to improve access to parks and
trails in a poor area may lead to wealthier people bidding
up the value of nearby houses and apartments.
All neighborhood types paid a premium to avoid fast
food, but the distaste premium increased by neighbor-
hood income level. A 10 percent increase in access to fast
food is associated with $1,302 ($1,740 in 2012 dollars)
in lower housing values among neighborhoods in the 4th
income quartile. The distaste premium for convenience
store access also increased by neighborhood income level.
Our results suggest that differential spatial access to
health-related amenities is associated with capitaliza-
tion. Capitalization has equity concerns in a bid model
because wealthier persons will inevitably be able to outbid
lower income people. Policies should encourage ubiqui-
tous access to healthy food and PA opportunities, because
without differential access, capitalization will not occur.
Some policies exist to spread access, such as enterprise
zones offering advantageous tax policies for supermar-
kets. Our results show that access to small fruit and
vegetable markets are more valued than supermarkets, so
subsidies to convenience stores, which themselves have
negative valuation, to sell healthier foods would help
equalize access. In terms of PA, smaller parks in several
locations would be preferred to a single large park (or a
few large parks). This is because access to a single large
park is easier to capitalize.
While capitalization has equity concerns, our results
offer a heretofore unavailed of method to reveal the value
persons place on access to health-related amenities. The
preference for access, particularly access for healthy food,
extends to neighborhoods of all income levels.
Our hope is that in future research efforts, we will be
able to use capitalization to control for selection, revealing
the true health effects of the built environment.
Limitations
One critical caveat to our findings is that they are rela-
tional, but not necessarily causal. For instance, an increase
Brown and Yarnell International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2013, 10:95 Page 10 of 11
http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/10/1/95
in the health-related amenities near a location can result
in increased prices because the amenities make the loca-
tion of the property more valuable. Even announced or
prospective changes in an area's amenities can affect hous-
ing pricing far before these additional amenities exist.
For example, houses in a neighborhood may increase in
value at the announcement of potential plans for build-
ing a neighborhood park, since this reflects the interest
of developers in the area's growth and improvement. Both
are examples of increased amenities, actual or planned,
driving housing prices.
However, directionality may also work in the opposite
direction. For instance, in the scenario of owned condo-
miniums or gated communities, the building of a new
walking or exercise area may depend on whether there
has been an increase in the buying value of these homes.
The additional income generated by the upscaled prices
may be part of a development plan for the condominium
or gated community to improve the value of the group
of homes, which will in turn, increase prices even fur-
ther. Thus, it is likely that in some scenarios, amenities
and prices affect each other reciprocally. Our data were
from a single wave, but future research considering multi-
ple waves of data on amenities and home prices may help
distinguish directions of causality.
Additionally, our data reflect a particular historical
period in the U.S. housing market, the early 2000s, which
we chose because of the relative absence of bubbles and
busts [32].
Conclusions
In this study, we addressed a gap in the literature by link-
ing research on the contextual factors that facilitate or
impede a healthy lifestyle with the hedonic price frame-
work, allowing us to estimate the degree to which these
factors are capitalized into housing prices. Although the
non-randomness of location is generally acknowledged in
the health economics literature, our results highlight the
extent and magnitude of the non-randomness. Our results
show that, even among people in the lowest income quar-
tile, access to better food comes at a premium. It is
acknowledged that income and health are highly corre-
lated, and our results show that the health benefits of
better access to food among the poor comes at the cost
of reduced income, net of housing costs. This perhaps
explains the mixed results in the literature.
Endnotes
1Note, however, that there can also be high-income
neighborhoods away from the city, since some prefer to
build larger houses on several acres. However, buying the
same house on the same number of acres, holding crime,
schools, etc., constant, closer to the center of the city
would cost more. For example, Victorian homes in
Manhattan were eventually sold due to the increasing
importance of New York City.
2Note that the Tiebout model is more concerned with
efficient taxation than capitalization [10].
