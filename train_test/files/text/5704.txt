Introduction
Scheier and Carver (1985) described optimism as a general-
ized tendency to expect positive outcomes even in the face of
obstacles. Optimists are individuals who expect good things
to happen to them; conversely, pessimists are those who
expect bad things to happen to them (Carver, Scheier, &
Segerstrom, 2010).
Dispositional optimism accompanies a number of adap-
tive psychological qualities (Segerstrom, 2010). People who
are more optimistic have less psychological distress, even
when things do not coincide with their expectations (Carver
et al., 2010). These individuals deal with stressors more
actively and more adaptively, using problem-focused strate-
gies when likely to be effective (i.e., in controllable situa-
tions such as academic challenges) and emotion-focused
strategies when likely to be effective (i.e., in uncontrollable
situations such as trauma; Solberg Nes & Segerstrom, 2006).
In prospective studies, people who were more optimistic had
more academic and professional success (Segerstrom, 2007;
Solberg Nes, Evans, & Segerstrom, 2009). Individuals who
are more optimistic also have more successful social rela-
tionships (e.g., Srivastava, McGonigal, Richards, Butler, &
Gross, 2006).
Optimism can therefore be considered a predictor of
behavior (Armor & Taylor, 1998), and has been linked to the
study of motivation and self-regulation (e.g., Bandura, 1986,
1997; Scheier & Carver, 1988). Optimists seem to employ
more problem-focused coping strategies and more effective
ways of emotional regulation, both of which contribute to
better functioning (S. E. Taylor & Armor, 1996).
Furthermore, several studies have targeted events that
might be viewed as challenging. At least two studies have
examined the role of optimism among students starting their
college experience (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1992; Brissette,
Scheier, & Carver, 2002). Optimism and other variables
were assessed upon the students' arrival on campus, and
measures of well-being were obtained at the end of the
semester. Higher optimism predicted less distress at the end
of the semester. Early studies examined student reports of
situational coping responses and general coping styles (e.g.,
Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 2001), finding that optimists
generally appear to be approach copers whereas pessimists
appear to be avoidant copers. Results dealing with like con-
cepts have repeatedly followed (Carver et al., 2010).
The rationale for relating optimism to decision making is
drawn from the idea that positive expectancies guide individ-
uals to an effective way of making decisions as they feel able
to implement adequate strategies and to sustain efforts to cope

Dispositional Optimism as a Correlate of
Decision-Making Styles in Adolescence
Paola Magnano1, Anna Paolillo2, and Barbara Giacominelli2
Abstract
Despite the numerous psychological areas in which optimism has been studied, including career planning, only a small amount
of research has been done to investigate the relationship between optimism and decision-making styles. Consequently, we
have investigated the role of dispositional optimism as a correlate of different decision-making styles, in particular, positive
for effective styles and negative for ineffective ones (doubtfulness, procrastination, and delegation). Data were gathered
through questionnaires administered to 803 Italian adolescents in their last 2 years of high schools with different fields of
study, each at the beginning stages of planning for their professional future. A paper questionnaire was completed containing
measures of dispositional optimism and career-related decision styles, during a vocational guidance intervention conducted at
school. Data were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression. Results supported the proposed model by showing optimism
to be a strong correlate of decision-making styles, thereby offering important intervention guidelines aimed at modifying
unrealistically negative expectations regarding their future and helping students learn adaptive decision-making skills.

withadversities(Scheier,Carver,&Bridges,1994).Moreover,
optimism has not only been found to predict adaptive career
planning strategies (Creed, Patton, & Bartrum, 2002); career
optimistic individuals also appear to strive higher academi-
cally, report greater comfort with their educational and career-
related plans, and engage in activities that enhance their
career insight (Rottinghaus, Day, & Borgen, 2005).
Optimism can therefore be associated with coping strate-
gies, emotional regulation, academic and professional suc-
cess, making it possible to hypothesize that the
decision-making process in vocational guidance--which is
related with all previously mentioned variables, as will be
highlighted later in the text--could be affected by optimism.
In fact, despite the important relationship between optimism
and many areas linked with scholastic well-being and suc-
cess, only a small amount of research has investigated the
relationship between optimism and career planning.
Moreover, recent models in vocational guidance have applied
positive psychology principles to school education
(Seligman, Ernst, Gillham, Reivich, & Linkins, 2009) and to
vocational counseling (Soresi & Nota, 2014), with the aim of
helping individuals develop personal resources such as hope,
optimism, and resilience, which thus enable them to face
uncertainty and challenges in career planning.
So, even though optimism performs a self-regulatory
function in determining whether an individual will initiate or
maintain working toward desired goals, a small number of
studies have investigated optimism as it pertains to career
choice (Creed et al., 2002; Petrone, 2000; Powell & Luzzo,
1998). Career development can be considered an adapta-
tional process, requiring individuals to evaluate their situa-
tion, consider their personal interests, values, and beliefs
when they make decisions about careers, and subsequently
manage this ongoing process. Optimism is referred to as an
appraisal style within this framework as this predisposition
can influence the way an individual thinks, feels, and acts in
a particular situation. An individual, for example, who tends
to expect that positive outcomes will occur is likely to par-
ticipate in career-related activities, to set vocationally ori-
ented goals, and to respond with positive affect (Patton,
Bartrum, & Creed, 2004).
Creed and colleagues (2002) found that students who
endorsed higher levels of optimism showed greater career
planning and exploration, were more decided about their
career and had more career goals, whereas those with high
levels of pessimism reported a lower awareness and knowl-
edge with regard to career choice, were more indecisive, and
performed more poorly academically. In this field, career
decision making is strongly involved due to the fact that the
choices influence life directions and outcomes. Creed,
Patton, and Bartrum (2004) pointed out that career issues are
particularly salient for adolescent populations where young
people need to be informed, skilled, and confident about set-
ting future goals and making career-related decisions. In the
broad sense, career maturity refers then to the individual's
readiness to make informed, age-appropriate career deci-
sions and cope with career development tasks (Savickas,
1989). Definitions include the individual's ability to make
appropriate career choices, including awareness of what is
required for making informed decisions regarding one's
career and the degree to which one's choices are both realis-
tic and consistent over time (Levinson, Ohler, Caswell, &
Kiewra, 1998). Finally, Patton et al. (2004) have suggested
that optimism performs a key role in motivating the develop-
ment of career goals and expectations and in encouraging the
student to remain engaged in these activities, despite adversi-
ties that may arise. Having a positive outlook on life appears
to perform a conducive and regulatory role for males and
females in the career development process. An analysis of
this short review, despite the fact that that many career-
related variables have been investigated, reveals that there
are no studies that directly link optimism with decision-mak-
ing styles in vocational guidance.
Decision-Making Styles
The decision-making style can be defined as the tendency to
deal with choices according to personal tendencies.
Individuals, responding to specific situations, tend to use a
personal style more frequently than others, and thus show a
predominant style.
Miller and Byrnes (2001) have defined decision making
as the process of choosing between different alternatives
while in the midst of pursuing one's goal. Concerning the
relationship between personality and decision making, many
studies have suggested the existence of different typologies
of decision-making styles (Brew, Hesketh, & Taylor, 2001;
Franken & Muris, 2005). Driver, Brousseau, and Hunsaker
(1990) postulated that individuals have a primary decision-
making style and a secondary style thus providing them with
a range of strategies to choose from, which they can use for
different decisions (R. Singh & Greenhaus, 2004). In short,
although an individual's approach to a given decisional task
may be characterized by one predominant style, elements of
other styles can be present (Harren, 1979). As Gati, Gadassi,
and Mashiah-Cohen (2012) have highlighted, there has been
an increased criticism of the single-most-dominant-trait
approach to career decision-making styles. Researchers have
argued that individuals in fact have more than one style
(Driver et al., 1990) and that they have a range of strategies
to choose from, which can be used for different decisions (R.
Singh & Greenhaus, 2004). Indeed, studies have shown that
the single-dominant-trait approach only partially accounts
for individual differences in decision making (Shiloh, Salton,
& Sharabi, 2002). We agree with Scott and Bruce (1995),
that referred to career decision-making style as a "learned
habitual response pattern exhibited by an individual when
confronted with a decision situation. It is not a personality
trait, but a habit-based propensity to react in a certain way in
a specific decision context" (p. 820); so we are convinced
Magnano et al. 3
that, even though many external (e.g., involvement in deci-
sion, time necessary for good decision making) and internal
(motivation, self-esteem, self-determination, perceived
resources) variables affect the decision-making process,
whenever a choice is perceived as important for the future,
individuals tend to use an habitual response pattern.
Starting from some traditional classifications (Arroba,
1977; Harren, 1979; Mann, Burnett, Radford, & Ford, 1997),
which have categorized individuals into groups according to
a single dominant decision-making style, Di Nuovo and
Magnano (2013), using statistical classification techniques,
found four decision-making styles:
1. Doubtfulness, which refers to emotional interference
such as worry and anxiety regarding choices. It refers
to negative emotionality, uncertainty.
2. Delegation, which includes the tendency to attribute
to others (significant or not) the responsibility of
choice. It is similar to Harren's (1979) dependent
style and very close to avoidance in Mann et al.'s
(1997) classification. It is related to an external locus
of control.
3. Procrastination, which refers to the tendency to avoid
or delay beginning or advancing through the career
decision-making process.
4. No problem, which is similar to the rational style
(Harren, 1979), logic (Arroba, 1977), and vigilance
(Mann et al., 1997); it includes the ability to define
objectives, to plan actions, to seek information, and
to evaluate alternatives carefully.
The choice of the authors to adopt this classification, as
well as the resulting scale, derives from the necessity to cre-
ate a concise instrument that, along with other scales, is easy
to apply in vocational guidance interventions in school/aca-
demic contexts. Previous research (Di Nuovo, Magnano,
Paolillo, & Taibi, 2011; Magnano, 2013) have already used
the present decision-making classification and the related
measurement instrument in association with measures of
vocational guidance variables (such as professional interests,
self-image, decisional self-efficacy, attributional styles),
showing to be good predictors of effective career choice.
Although Harren (1979) suggested that the most effective
approach to decision making is the use of a rational style,
studies show conflicting results. As Mau (2000) has pointed
out, a rational decision-making style has been found to be
associated with career maturity (Blustein, 1987), career deci-
siveness (Mau, 1995), problem-solving efficacy (Heppner,
1978; Phillips, Pazienza, & Ferrin, 1984). In contrast, a non-
rational decision-making style tends to be inversely related
to progress in resolving various career tasks (Mau & Jepsen,
1992; Osipow & Reed, 1985). Although a rational decision-
making style is generally postulated as an ideal style, some
research (Chartrand, Rose, Elliott, Marmarosh, & Caldwell,
1993; Mau, 1995; Phillips, Pazienza, & Walsh, 1984; Phillips
& Strohmer, 1982; Rubinton, 1980) has indicated that it is
neither significantly nor necessarily associated with progress
in career-related tasks.
According to Klaczynski, Byrnes, and Jacobs (2001), the
decisions and the processes by which these decisions are
made differ according to the level of motivation and self-
involvement for the particular individual (Klaczynski &
Fauth, 1997) and may vary across problem contexts as a
function of personal relevance (Finken & Jacobs, 1996).
However, despite widening interest in these issues, there are
still relatively few developmental studies of motivational
and affective (e.g., mood) influences on decision making.
Individual differences in psychosocial and social cognitive
dispositions, and their relationships to decision-making
processes, have also received sparse attention in develop-
mental decision-making literature (Moshman, 1999; Perkins,
Jay, & Tishman, 1993; Steinberg & Cauffman, 1996).
Correlations between relatively stable personality charac-
teristics, such as impulsivity and sensation seeking, and
aspects of decision making have been demonstrated (see
Byrnes, 1998). Moreover, in a study done by Jin, Watkins,
and Yuen (2009), it was pointed out that conscientiousness,
extroversion, and low neuroticism are the prominent person-
ality traits that consistently relate to increased career infor-
mation seeking and decidedness (Lounsbury, Hutchens, &
Loveland, 2005; Reed, Bruch, & Hasse, 2004), whereas low
openness is strongly correlated with high-identity foreclo-
sure (Clancy & Dollinger, 1993).
Conversely, Saka and Gati (2007) posited that numerous
studies have examined the relations between these various
personality and behavioral characteristics on one hand, and
career indecision and indecisiveness on the other (e.g., Kelly
& Lee, 2005; Leong & Chervinko, 1996; Slaney, 1988). The
variables studied include self-esteem and self-confidence
(Kishor, 1981), self-efficacy (K. M. Taylor & Betz, 1983),
locus of control (K. M. Taylor, 1982), anxiety (Fuqua,
Seaworth, & Newman, 1987), and personal and vocational
identity (C. R. Cohen, Chartrand, & Jowdy, 1995). Finally,
effective decision making is positively related with general-
ized self-efficacy and with global self-esteem (Betz & Klein,
1996).
Therefore, if we consider that optimism and pessimism
may play a functional role in the development of career-
related variables (Creed et al., 2004) and that the decision-
making process is related to numerous psychological
variables such as self-esteem, self-efficacy, locus of control,
and other personality characteristics described above, we can
then hypothesize that optimism also plays a role in the effec-
tiveness of decision making, specifically in the area of career
planning.
Gender Differences
Literature regarding gender differences in optimism and
decision making (career planning) is not definitive. Petrone
4 SAGE Open
(2000), testing the construct of career maturity against the
criterion measures of vocational identity, optimism for the
future, and level of intelligence, found that females had
higher scores on measures of competency for career decision
making than males, whereas males scored higher on mea-
sures of vocational identity states and possessed a greater
sense of optimism for the future. Conversely, Loo (2000)
found no significant gender differences on decision-making
styles.
Moreover, other recent studies have revealed significant
gender differences in career decision making; women tend to
invest more effort in the decision-making process and to con-
sult more with others whereas men tend to make quicker
final decisions (Gati et al., 2010); girls tend to invest more
effort in the process, consult more with others, depend less
on others, and be more inclined to please others. Boys, how-
ever, tend to make final decisions faster than girls. Girls also
have higher scores than boys in information gathering and
internal locus of control, all of which can affect the time
needed to make a choice (Ginevra, Nota, Soresi, & Gati,
2012). Women reported a greater willingness to consult with
others about the decision-making process and reported them-
selves to be slower in making the final decision than did men
(Gadassi, Gati, & Dayan, 2012).
An analysis of these unclear results derived from the lit-
erature suggests that gender could play a role in the choice
and application of a specific decision-making style; for this
reason, in the present study it will be considered as a control
variable.
Aim of the Study
In a very recent study, Tolentino et al. (2014) highlighted that
a solid body of research has shown the benefits of optimism
on health-related adjustment (e.g., better quality of life and
subjective well-being in Scheier & Carver, 1992; less psy-
chological distress in Carver et al., 2005; Fitzgerald, Tennen,
Affleck, & Pransky, 1993; Trunzo & Pinto, 2003) as well as
on academic adjustment and satisfaction (Aspinwall &
Taylor, 1992; McIlveen, Beccaria, & Burton, 2013).
Furthermore, optimism has not only been found to predict
adaptive career planning strategies (Creed et al., 2002),
career optimistic individuals have also been reported to
strive higher academically, report greater comfort with their
educational and career-related plans, and engage in activities
that enhance their career insight (Rottinghaus et al., 2005).
Optimists also tend to be confident and persistent in the
face of diverse life challenges, leading them to differ from
pessimists in the manner in which they cope with stressful
situations (Brissette et al., 2002; Solberg Nes & Segerstrom,
2006), such as the potentially stressful decision of deciding
upon a career.
In addition, the positive effects of dispositional optimism
have largely been understood in terms of Carver and Scheier's
(1981, 1982) and Scheier and Carver's (1988) cybernetic
model of self-regulation. According to this model, goal-
directed behaviors are strongly influenced by people's
expectations about what the outcomes of their behaviors will
be (Bandura, 1986; Seligman, 1975); in particular, these
behaviors are affected by the level of confidence regarding
whether a particular goal can be reached or not. Doubts
regarding the attainment of a particular goal may lead an
individual to stop pursuing the goal prematurely or prevent
theindividualfromtakingactioninthefirstplace.Conversely,
if one expects to successfully reach a goal, behavior will be
initiated (Armor & Taylor, 1998; Carver et al., 2010).
In the same way, the career-decision process can be seen
as an example of goal-directed behavior, in which the indi-
vidual's level of confidence regarding goal achievement can
determine success or failure. Thus, the career-decision pro-
cess (and, in particular, the "preferred" personal decision
style) can be affected from the internal and generalized ten-
dency to expect positive or negative outcomes.
In light of this, whereas optimists'expectations could pro-
mote perseverance in the face of challenges, pessimists may
procrastinate or give up when confronted with challenges
due to their expectation that outcomes will be unfavorable
(e.g., Scheier & Carver, 1999; Seligman, 1991).
It is perhaps due to their higher level of confidence regard-
ing the future that optimists utilize a number of active coping
methods when confronted with challenges (Jackson, Weiss,
& Lundquist, 2000); in contrast, pessimists have more doubts
concerning future events and may therefore rely on strategies
associated with avoidance and escape from adversity (Carver
& Scheier, 2014). Research has demonstrated that optimists
generally depend more on strategies such as modifying con-
trollable aspects of stressors (Scheier, Weintraub, & Carver,
1986), seeking information (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1992),
planning (Scheier et al., 1989), and positive reframing (Park,
Moore, Turner, & Adler, 1997), aspects which are related to
adequate and no-problematic decision-making styles (Di
Nuovo & Magnano, 2013).
Hence, we hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 1: Dispositional optimism will be positively
related to effective decision-making styles after control-
ling for gender of participants.
In conjunction with this, research has demonstrated that
pessimists tend to employ strategies similar to procrastina-
tion such as cognitive or behavioral avoidance (Stanton &
Snider, 1993)--a strategy typically associated with the pro-
crastination style--and escape (e.g., Carver, Scheier, &
Weintraub, 1989), and consequently wind up delegating their
choice to others. Several studies have found negative rela-
tionships between optimism and anxiety (Bagana, Raciu, &
Lupu, 2011; I. Singh & Jha, 2013), and negative emotional-
ity (S. E. Taylor & Armor, 1996), which can be considered
components of the doubtfulness style. In addition, optimism
is related to the effective management of uncertainty
Magnano et al. 5
(Aspinwall, Richter, & Hoffman, 2001), which is an ability
that is lacking in the doubtfulness style. Consequently, we
hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 2: Dispositional optimism will be negatively
related to doubtfulness, after controlling for gender of
participants.
Hypothesis 3: Dispositional optimism will be negatively
related to procrastination, after controlling for gender of
participants.
Hypothesis 4: Dispositional optimism will be negatively
related to delegation, after controlling for gender of
participants.
To sum up, optimists expect to be able to make decisions
successfully regarding desired states of actions and thus use
positive decision-making styles. In fact, optimists are less
likely to expect to fail in choosing their own careers and are
thus less likely to use dysfunctional decision-making styles
to procrastinate decisions or to delegate to others whom they
perceive as being more competent than themselves.
Method
Design and Procedure
The cross-sectional study presented was born within a voca-
tional guidance intervention conducted in classroom groups at
the end of their high school career, because they were about to
embark on a decision-making process. The participation of the
students was completely voluntary. Managed through princi-
pals of the schools, parents of admitted participants signed an
informed consent form. Tests were administrated collectively
in classroom groups without the presence of teachers. This
survey was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Commission
of Kore University and the University of Verona. The research
protocol included the two surveys presented in the following
paragraph; the order of the surveys was counterbalanced.
Measures
1. Life Orientation Test­Revised (LOT-R; Scheier et al.,
1994; Italian adaptation, Anolli, 2005) measures dispo-
sitional optimism by a 10-item scale, with 4 filler items
and 6 scale items. LOT-R Total scores are calculated by
adding the 3 positively worded and 3 negatively worded
items (these are reverse coded). Respondents are asked
to indicate their level of agreement with each of the
items on a 4-point scale (from strongly agree to strongly
disagree). This gives a possible score range of 6 to 24,
with higher scores indicating a higher level of optimism.
Anolli reports an internal reliability coefficient of .82.
Cronbach's alpha calculation on the sample of the study
is .86. Sample items include "In uncertain times, I usu-
ally expect the best," "If something can go wrong for
me, it will" (items reverse scored). Scheier and Carver
(1985) considered optimism to be a unidimensional
construct, putting optimism and pessimism as polar
opposites, suggesting that an individual can be optimis-
tic or pessimistic but cannot be both.
The choice of this instrument was due to the lack of spe-
cific tests for the assessment of optimism in the realm of
vocational guidance adapted to fit the Italian context.
Moreover LOT-R has been used together with measures of
career maturity, career decision making, career goals and
well-being in a study which involved 504 high school stu-
dents (Creed et al., 2002), showing Cronbach's  = .60.
2. Decision-Making Styles (DMS; Di Nuovo &
Magnano, 2013) is a 15-item test, with 5-point Likert-
type scale (1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree);
DMS measures four decision-making styles, three of
which are considered ineffective (doubtfulness, pro-
crastination, delegation) and one, namely "no prob-
lem" considered effective. Cronbach's alpha for each
subscale has been calculated on the sample of the
study, giving the following values: doubtfulness,  =
.79; procrastination,  = .82; delegation,  = .83; no
problem,  = .77. Sample items included, When I
have to make a decision or a choice that is important
for me . . . "I feel worried and I try to put off the
choice" (doubtfulness), "I'm afraid of making mis-
takes and ask my parents to decide in my place" (del-
egation), "I feel worried and I try to defer the choice"
(procrastination), "I already have clear ideas and I am
sure what to choose" (no problem).
This instrument was created and validated for the Italian
population to assess decision-making styles in vocational
guidance. Predictive validity has been tested through the
measurement of the effectiveness of the choices in the transi-
tion from middle to high school.
Participants
Data were collected through convenience sampling. The par-
ticipants were 803 Italian adolescents (males = 381, 47.45%;
females = 422, 52.55%; 2 = 2.09, df = 1, p = .15), aged 16 to
22 years (M = 17.73 years, SD = 0.87 years), coming from
the last 2 years (fourth class = 451, fifth class = 352) of dif-
ferent types of high schools.
Data Analysis
All the analytical tools utilized for the present study were
implemented by using SPSS 21.0.
First of all, descriptives and correlations between studied
variables were analyzed; then, a series of stepwise multiple
regressions was performed.

As previous research has suggested that gender may affect
decision-making style (Gadassi et al., 2012; Ginevra et al.,
2012; Petrone, 2000), a decision was made to use this socio-
demographic variable as a covariate for each hypothesis.
Therefore, each covariate was monitored by entering "gen-
der variable" in the first step of the regression equation, fol-
lowed by "optimism" entered stepwise.
Results
Descriptives and Correlations
Table 1 provides an overview of the means, SDs, and correla-
tions between variables. All correlations (Pearson's r coeffi-
cient) are statistically significant.
Hypothesis 1
Hypothesis 1: Dispositional optimism would be posi-
tively related to effective decision-making styles, after
controlling for gender of participants.
"Gender" was entered in the first step, followed by "opti-
mism" entered stepwise. In the final equation, gender was not
associated with "no problem" decision style whereas, as dis-
played in Table 2, optimism significantly accounted for this
effective decision-making style ( = .33, R2 = .11, p < .001).
Thus, Hypothesis 1 was supported.
Hypothesis 2
Hypothesis 2: Dispositional optimism would be nega-
tively related to doubtfulness, after controlling for gender
of participants.
Gender was entered in the first step, followed by optimism
entered stepwise. In the final equation, gender was not asso-
ciated with doubtfulness whereas, as displayed in Table 3,
optimism significantly accounted for this decision-making
style ( = -.34, R2 = .12, p < .001).
Therefore, Hypothesis 2 was supported.
Hypothesis 3
Hypothesis 3: Dispositional optimism would be nega-
tively related to procrastination, after controlling for gen-
der of participants.
Gender was entered in the first step, followed by optimism
entered stepwise. In the final equation, gender was not asso-
ciated with procrastination whereas, as displayed in Table 4,
optimism significantly accounted for it ( = -.26,
R2 = .07, p < .001). Thus, Hypothesis 3 was supported.
Hypothesis 4
Hypothesis 4: Dispositional optimism would be nega-
tively related to delegation, after controlling for gender of
participants.

Gender was entered in the first step, followed by optimism
entered stepwise. As displayed in Table 5, gender signifi-
cantly accounted for delegation ( = -.24, t = 6.54, p < .001)
as males reported higher scores than females (M = 1.75 vs.
M = 1.46). Moreover, optimism was found to be negatively
related to delegation as well ( = -0.12, R2 = .02, p < .001),
thereby supporting Hypothesis 4.
Table 6 shows gender differences for all the decision-
making styles with relative Cohen's d, which indicates more
accurately the effect size of the differences, not depending on
the sample size (as it is for the t test; nevertheless, its signifi-
cance is reported on the last column). J. Cohen (1988)
defined effect sizes as "small, d = .2," "medium, d = .5," and
"large, d = .8" (p. 25); as it is shown in Table 6, the effect size
for the gender differences in delegation style can be consid-
ered as moderated (d = .46), whereas the effect sizes for all
the other decision-making styles are small (d < .2).
Discussion
The aim of the study was to verify if dispositional optimism
was positively related to effective decision-making styles
and negatively related to doubtfulness, procrastination, and
delegation, after having controlled for gender. Data analysis
supported the hypothesis, showing the following results:
There is a positive relationship between optimism and the
effective decision-making style--referred to as "no prob-
lem"; the three ineffective decision-making styles--doubt-
fulness, procrastination, and delegation--have a negative
relationship with the optimism. About gender differences,
there is a significance difference between males and females
in the delegation style, which shows higher scores in males'
subsample. The literature (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1992; Creed
et al., 2002; McIlveen et al., 2013; Rottinghaus et al., 2005)
posits that optimists tend to manage change and uncertainty
favorably because they are able to demonstrate flexibility
when appraising and responding to new situations (Tolentino
et al., 2014); Patton et al. (2004) have concluded that opti-
mism encourages the student to persevere toward career
goals, despite adversities that may arise: "Having a positive
outlook on life appears to perform a conducive and regula-
tory role for males and females in the career development
process" (p. 205). The results of our study, confirming our
hypotheses, suggest that optimism could perform a key role
in decisional situations. As underlined in the literature
review, optimistic expectations have been found to promote
persistence and to facilitate performance on tasks (Armor &
Taylor, 1998); optimists appear generally to be approach
copers (Carver et al., 2010): these can be considered the most
important characteristics of no-problematic decision-making
styles (Di Nuovo & Magnano, 2013). On the contrary, lower
levels of optimism are associated to avoidance coping strate-
gies (Carver et al., 2010), which is one of the principal com-
ponents of procrastination style; moreover, the negative
relationship between optimism, anxiety, and negative emo-
tions, highlighted in previous studies (Bagana et al., 2011;
Ringeisen & Buchwald, 2010) could explain the negative
relationship between optimism and doubtfulness decision-
making style; then, dependent decision-making style is
marked by pessimistic views of the decisional process
(Brown et al., 2012), as delegation style in our results.
Surprisingly, there were significant differences in terms
of gender regarding delegation; similar differences do not
emerge in the validation study of the DMS (Di Nuovo &
Magnano, 2013), in which the mean scores of the male's sub-
sample in this area are not significantly higher than females'.
Other studies, indeed, have shown women's scores to be
higher than men's in terms of effort invested, which can be
considered the opposite of delegation, a decision-making
style we have referred to as the tendency to attribute to others
(significant or not) the responsibility of choice (Gati et al.,
2010). Another recent study (Ginevra et al., 2012) has high-
lighted that Italian girls also have higher scores than boys in
information gathering and internal locus of control. If we
consider that delegation is related with external locus of con-
trol, as stated above, the literature seems to confirm our
results.
The results of our study could make a contribution toward
an intervention in vocational and educational guidance. As
optimism is also associated with other important school out-
comes, for example, it is negatively correlated to exam anxi-
ety (Bagana et al., 2011) and positively related to social
competence in children (Deptula, Cohen, Phillipsen, & Ey,
2006), positive education (Seligman et al., 2009)--a school
intervention based on Positive Psychology--could represent
an effective approach to improve important skills. As
Seligman et al. (2009, p.294-295) has highlighted,
positive mood produces broader attention (Bolte, Goschke, &
Kuhl, 2003; Fredrickson, 1998; Fredrickson & Branigan, 2005;

Rowe, Hirsh, Anderson, & Smith, 2007), more creative thinking
(Estrada, Isen, & Young, 1994; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki,
1987), and more holistic thinking (Isen, Rosenzweig, & Young,
1991; Kuhl, 1983, 2000) . . . Were it possible, well-being should
be taught in school on three grounds: as an antidote to depression,
as a vehicle for increasing life satisfaction, and as an aid to better
learning and more creative thinking. Because most young people
attend school, schools provide the opportunity to reach them and
enhance their well-being on a wide scale.
A positive education reduces hopelessness (Brunwasser &
Gillham, 2008) and prevents anxiety (Seligman et al., 2009),
which can be related with ineffective decision-making
styles.
Applying these principles to vocational guidance, the new
paradigm of Life Design (Savickas et al., 2009) focuses on
intervention to increase career adaptability, which includes
the tendency to consider life within a time perspective
anchored in hope and optimism. In a very recent work, Soresi
and Nota (2014) collected a series of studies and interven-
tions' proposals, which use the constructs of positive psy-
chology--including optimism--to develop life skills in
many different contexts (school, university, organizations)
and for different kinds of people (children, adolescent, work-
ers, immigrants, disabled).
To conclude, the results of this study could be used by
school counselors and advisors in developing programs
aimed at increasing students' optimism as development in
this area could improve overall well-being, self-efficacy,
academic achievement, and, moreover, effective decision
making; in fact, in most circumstances, optimism appears to
be the best strategy, because it allows individuals to acquire
resources to pursue goals, be persistent, and be open to
opportunities (if they are realistically available; Forgeard &
Seligman, 2012). At last, optimistic students are more adapt-
able given their confident future orientation and focus on
strengths amid adversity (Tolentino et al., 2014); optimists'
positive expectancies enable them to demonstrate flexibility,
a necessary attribute for adaptation when appraising and
responding to new and uncertain situations (Aspinwall et al.,
2001), helping to guide students toward a better career adapt-
ability (Savickas et al., 2009).
Limitations and Conclusions
Obviously, the study presents some weaknesses. First of all,
study variables were measured from the same source (stu-
dents) thus creating a single-source bias. It would be more
beneficial to control for this effect at the research design
stage; for example, future research should collect the ratings
at different times and from separate sources (if this is logisti-
cally possible).
A further limitation of the study is the cross-sectional
measurement. It was not possible to test the causal relation-
ships proposed in the theoretical framework. It is important
to note that there may be a reverse causal relationship to the
one hypothesized in the current study. That is, decision-mak-
ing styles may be an antecedent of optimism rather than its
outcome (i.e., maladaptive decision-making style creates
negative outcomes and develops pessimism). This reasoning
can be extended to suggest that optimism and decision-mak-
ing styles could both depend on higher level variables, or that
optimism may be only one factor among many others that
relate to decision-making styles (e.g., cognitive styles, per-
sonality traits, self-efficacy). It is therefore suggested that
future longitudinal research on optimism and decision-mak-
ing styles, together with other variables, is required to better
understand their relationship.
Moreover, we cannot consider the sample of our study as
representative, considering the fact that we used a conve-
nience sampling.
Despite the above limitations, ours is one of the first stud-
ies that has empirically tested the relationship between opti-
mism and decision-making styles; its significant results
suggest that further research should be undertaken to repli-
cate these findings.
