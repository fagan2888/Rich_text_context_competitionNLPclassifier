Physician Career Satisfaction Across Specialties
J. Paul Leigh, PhD; Richard L. Kravitz, MD, MSPH; Mike Schembri, MS;
Steven J. Samuels, PhD; Shanaz Mobley, BS
Background: The career satisfaction and dissatisfac-
tion physicians experience likely influence the quality of
medical care.
Objective: To compare career satisfaction across spe-
cialties among US physicians.
Methods: We analyzed data from the Community Track-
ing Study of 12474 physicians (response rate, 65%) for
the late 1990s. Data are cross-sectional. Two satisfac-
tion variables were created: very satisfied and dissatis-
fied. Thirty-three specialty categories were analyzed.
Results: After adjusting for control variables, the follow-
ing specialties are significantly more likely than family
medicine to be very satisfying: geriatric internal medi-
cine (odds ratio [OR], 2.04); neonatal-perinatal medi-
cine (OR, 1.89); dermatology (OR, 1.48); and pediatrics
(OR,1.36).Thefollowingaresignificantlymorelikelythan
family medicine to be dissatisfying: otolaryngology (OR,
1.78); obstetrics-gynecology (OR, 1.61); ophthalmology
(OR, 1.51); orthopedics (OR, 1.36); and internal medi-
cine(OR,1.22).Amongthecontrolvariables,wealsofound
nonlinear relations between age and satisfaction; high sat-
isfaction among physicians in the west north Central and
New England states and high dissatisfaction in the south
Atlantic, west south Central, Mountain, and Pacific states;
positive associations between income and satisfaction; and
no differences between women and men.
Conclusions: Career satisfaction and dissatisfaction vary
across specialty as well as age, income, and region. These
variations are likely to be of interest to residency direc-
tors, managed care administrators, students selecting a
specialty, and physicians in the groups with high satis-
faction and dissatisfaction.

reasonsforthisattention.First,
physicians who are satisfied
with their careers are likely to provide bet-
terhealthcarethandissatisfiedphysicians.
Physician satisfaction has been found to
stronglycorrelatewithpatientsatisfaction.7
Second, high physician satisfaction is also
likely to result from good outcomes with
patients.8 Satisfaction,therefore,maybean
indirect measure of patient outcomes.
Dissatisfactionisalsoofconcern.First,

satisfaction,ifprolonged,mayresultinhealth
problems for the physicians themselves.10
Third, dissatisfied physicians may be more
inclined to unionize11 and strike.12
There are several possible sources of
variation in physician satisfaction. Studies

rayetal1 foundthatwomenhada60%greater
chance than men of reporting "burnout."
Frank et al2 found that women physicians
were generally satisfied with their careers.
Haas et al3 found that younger physicians

RESULTS
Table 1 presents cross-tabulations for the control vari-
ables and specialties, on the one hand, with dependent
variables--very satisfied and dissatisfied--on the other.
The mean age is 48 years. Roughly, 79% of the sample
are board certified, 20% are graduates of foreign medi-
cal schools, and 20% are women. The income category
with the highest percentage is $100000 to $149999.
Roughly, 35% are full owners of their practices; 23% are
part owners. These physicians spend an average of 54.6
hours per week working.
Table 1 also lists specialties ranked by the number
of respondents. The greatest number of physicians are
in family medicine followed by internal medicine and then
pediatrics.
Specialties that are consistently at the extremes and
consistently statistically different from all specialties
combined (P.05, 2 test) are geriatric internal medi-
cine, dermatology, pediatrics, internal medicine, and ob-
stetrics-gynecology. But these 2 tests in Table 1 do not
adjust for confounders.
Thedistributionofsatisfactionneednotbeuniformfor
any given specialty. The distribution might be bimodal.
METHODS
DATA
Data were drawn from the Community Tracking Physician
Survey (CTS) for 1996-1997. The survey was given to a rep-
resentative sample of physicians not employed by the fed-
eral government, who reside in the continental United States
andwhoprovidedirectpatientcareatleast20hoursperweek.
The survey followed a complex design with 60 sites and a
small independently drawn national sample.20 Some special-
ists such as radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists
as well as all residents and fellows were excluded from the
sample. Primary care physicians were oversampled. Physi-
cians were randomly selected within sites as well as physi-
cian strata.20 The overall response rate was 65%. Response
rates by physician specialty were not available. However, the
CTS data gatherers maintain that the data are representative
of the physicians within the nation.20 Moreover, to enhance
the integrity of our findings, we analyzed only specialties for
which we had data on at least 40 physicians.
The CTS had data on 12528 physicians. However, 25
physicians did not have useful answers for the satisfaction
question, and 29 physicians had missing data on 1 or more
ofthecontrolvariables.Oursamplesize,therefore,was12474.
DEPENDENT VARIABLES
Twodependentvariablesindicatedwhetherthephysicianis
verysatisfiedordissatisfied.Theywerebothcreatedfroman-
swerstothefollowingquestion:"Thinkingverygenerallyabout
yoursatisfactionwithyouroverallcareerinmedicine,would
yousaythatyouarecurrentlyverysatisfied(n=5273),some-
what satisfied (n=4794), somewhat dissatisfied (n=1677),
very dissatisfied (n=518), neither satisfied nor dissatisfied
(n=212),don'tknow(n=16),refusetoanswer(n=9)?"Ifthe
physician responded "very satisfied," then our very satisfied
variable equaled 1; our very satisfied variable equaled 0 for
allotherresponses.Thedissatisfiedvariablecombinedresponses
in the "somewhat dissatisfied" (n=1679) with the "very dis-
satisfied" (n=519) categories. Our very satisfied and dissat-
isfied variables were intended to capture the extremes. We
didnotclassify"somewhatsatisfied"or"neithersatisfiednor
dissatisfied"ateitherextreme.Personsresponding"don'tknow"
or "refuse to answer" were excluded.
CONTROL VARIABLES
Control variables were not arbitrarily selected. We used the
mostpopularcontrolvariablesidentifiedintheliteraturethat,
in turn, rely on the Eisenberg model.21,22 These are most use-
fully classified as physician characteristics, experience with
managed care, community factors, and type of practice.
Physician characteristics included age, sex, whether
board certified, and whether a graduate of foreign medical
school. The physician's "experience with managed care" was
captured by the variable "percentage of revenue from man-
aged care." One community factor was whether the physi-
cian resides in a town or area with a population less than
200000 (roughly 8.6% of our sample resided in these towns
and areas). We intended for this variable to capture the
"rural and small town" effect. Other community factors
included 9 regions of the country: New England (Maine,
New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
and Connecticut); mid Atlantic (New York, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania); east north Central (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, and Wisconsin); west north Central (Minnesota,
Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and
Kansas); south Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, District of
Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, and Florida); east south Central (Ken-
tucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi); west south
Central (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas); Moun-
tain (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,
Arizona, Utah, and Nevada); and Pacific (Washington, Or-
egon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii).
Considerable information on type of practice was avail-
able in the CTS. Annual income was included in the fol-
lowing broad categories: under $50000; $50000 to $99999;
$100000 to $149999; $150000 to $199999; $200000 to
$249999; $250000 to $299999; and over $300000. Infor-
mation was also available on ownership of practice. We cre-
ated 2 variables: whether the physician is full owner (sole
proprietor) or part owner (partner). Finally, we also con-
sidered average weekly work hours as a control variable.
Specialties are classified in 33 categories (Table 1).

Orthopedic surgery is above the mean for both "very satis-
fied"and"dissatisfied."Thissuggeststhatorthopedistsare
sharply divided. However, the distribution might be bell
shaped,withfewresponsesattheextremes.Specialistswithin
physicalmedicineandrehabilitationarelesslikelythanother
physicianstobe"satisfied"butalsolesslikelytobe"dissat-
isfied." This suggests that few specialists in physical medi-
cinehaveextremesentimentsregardingcareersatisfaction.
A logistic regression was run for which log of the
odds of being very satisfied was the dependent variable
(Table 2 and Table 3), and another was run for being
dissatisfied (Table 4 and Table 5). That is, only 1 re-
gression generated the results in both Tables 2 and 3,
whereas a separate regression generated results in both
Tables 4 and 5. Results on the control variables appear
in Tables 2 and 4. Results on the 33 specialties appear in
Tables 3 and 5.
First, consider Table 2 (for which the dependent vari-
able is being very satisfied). Age younger than 35 years,
65 to 74 years, and 75 and older are all positively asso-
ciated with being very satisfied. The Figure suggests a
U-shaped curve and describes the relation between age
and being very satisfied. Being board certified, rural or
town residence, living in New England or the west north
Central, and higher income are positively and strongly
statistically associated with being very satisfied. The larg-
est odds ratio in this "positive association" group be-
longs to income between $250000 and $299999. Per-
sons in this earnings bracket are 98% more likely to report
being very satisfied than persons in the $100000 to
$149999 bracket.
Having graduated from a foreign medical school,
being a full owner of a practice, income between $50000
and $99999, and greater involvement in managed care
are strongly and negatively associated with being very sat-
isfied. Within this "negative association" group, being a

foreign medical school graduate, and being a full owner
generate the lowest odds ratios.
Incomes below $100000 generate odds ratios below
1.0. Incomes above $150000 generate odds ratios above
1.0. The general pattern is for these odds ratios to rise with
higherincome.Moreover,upperandlowerconfidencelim-
its tend to be either below 1.0 for low income or above
1.0 for high income. These results suggest that, after con-
trolling for work hours, income is among the most im-
portant predictors of being very satisfied.
Table 4 presents results for dissatisfied, again, among
control variables. Residing outside a city with a popula-
tiongreaterthan200000(therural/townvariable)andhigh
income are negatively and strongly statistically significant
in their associations with being dissatisfied. Within the
"negativeassociation"group,incomebetween$250000and
$299999 generates the lowest odds ratio. Persons in that
income bracket are 40% less likely than persons in the
$100000to$149999brackettoreportdissatisfaction.Posi-
tive and statistically significant associations are found for
being a foreign medical school graduate; living in the south
Atlantic, west south Central, Mountain, and Pacific states;
being either a full owner or a partner; receiving a higher
percentage of revenue from managed care; and increased
weekly work hours. Within this positive association group,
beingafullowner,followedbylivingintheMountainstates,
generate the largest odds ratios.
Dissatisfaction tends to rise with age, but levels off
at age 65 years. Increased work hours are associated with
more dissatisfaction.
We turn now to results on the specialties (Tables 3
and 5). Table 3 presents the ranking of specialties for being
very satisfied. The highest statistically significant odds ra-
tios in Table 3 belong to geriatric internal medicine, neo-
natal-perinatal medicine, dermatology, pediatrics, and "all
other" specialties. Persons in these specialties are 104%,

COMMENT
More than 70% of US physicians reported being satis-
fied or very satisfied with their careers in medicine. These
high satisfaction levels among most physicians, despite
the many challenges of our changing health care sys-
tem, are testaments to the enduring rewards of the sci-
ence and practice of medicine. However, only about 2
out of 5 physicians are very satisfied with their careers,
and nearly 1 in 5 are dissatisfied. These somewhat mixed
results are disappointing given the enormous indi-
vidual and societal investments required to prepare a fully-
trained physician.
In this discussion, we first consider the results on
the specialty variables and on the control variables. Then
we compare these results with the literature and con-
sider the implications of our results and limitations of
our study. Finally, we draw a conclusion.
RESULTS OF INTERSPECIALTY
AND OTHER COMPARISONS
Theinterspecialtycomparisonsincludesomeexpectedand
some unexpected results. Obstetrics-gynecology special-
ists report high dissatisfaction, perhaps related to rising
expectations for perfect birth outcomes and high medi-
colegal risks.24 At the other end of the spectrum, derma-
tology has consistently been viewed as one of the most at-
tractive specialties by graduating medical students owing
toitscontrollablelifestyle,relativelynarrowfocus,andbur-
geoning scientific knowledge base.14
More surprising is the relatively high proportion of
dissatisfiedphysiciansamongthosepracticingcertain"pro-
cedural" specialties (eg, ophthalmology, pulmonary medi-
cine, otolaryngology, and orthopedic surgery). In con-
trast,physicianspracticingsome"cognitive"specialties(eg,
infectious diseases, geriatrics, and pediatrics) were un-
likely to be dissatisfied. This is puzzling, especially given
the high income and prestige associated with the "proce-
dural" specialties. But it may not be the historical income
and prestige levels that are relevant but rather the change
in these levels that has occurred in recent years that is rel-
evant. There has been considerable loss of income, au-
tonomy, and job openings for procedural specialties over
thepast15yearswiththeadvanceofmanagedcare.25 Sharp
declines in job-opening advertisements from 1990 to 1996
occurred for most of the procedural specialties.26 Small de-
clines and some increases (family medicine) occurred
among the cognitive specialties.26 The surgical subspe-
cialties in particular have been among the hardest hit by
Medicare payment reform and managed care.27 Other CTS
results suggest that procedural specialties are more likely
to perceive problems in providing high quality care un-
der various managed care arrangements than are primary
care physicians.28 Although we enter covariates reflect-
ing $50000 increments of income and percentage of rev-
enue from managed care into the equation, these covari-
ates are not likely to capture all of the subtle influences of
income and managed care. Moreover, we do not attempt
to control for any direct measure of autonomy.
Some of the interspecialty differences in satisfaction
may be explained by self-selection. For example, Fried-
man and Slatt29 found personality differences in introver-
sionandextroversionacrossstudentschoosingprimarycare,
obstetrics-gynecology, and surgical specialties. The broad
concept of "personality," therefore, could confound the re-
lation between specialty and satisfaction.
We turn now to the control variables. The age re-
sults suggest a nonlinear relation. A high percentage of
young physicians are very satisfied and an even higher
percentage of physicians aged 65 and older report being
very satisfied (Figure). This may be owing to the enthu-
siasm and idealism of youth and self-selection among the
elderly. Physicians who dislike their careers probably re-
tire by age 65 years. Physicians who do not retire by age
65 years probably derive considerable satisfaction from
their jobs.

sociatedwithdissatisfaction.Itisstatisticallyinsignificant
initsassociationwithbeingverysatisfied.Theseresultsun-
derscore the point that being very satisfied is not just the
oppositeofbeingdissatisfied.Theresultscouldbeexplained
by the marginal utility theory of work in economics. This
theory holds that leisure is preferred to work, in general,
andthatincreasedworkhoursgenerateincreased"disutil-
ity"(unhappiness)atanincreasingrate.30 The"increasing
rate" more likely occurs during a major shift from some-
what satisfied to dissatisfied as opposed to the minor shift
from very satisfied to somewhat satisfied.

Results for foreign medical school graduates are
strong and consistent; they are much less likely to re-
port being very satisfied and much more likely to report
being dissatisfied than US graduates. These results are
consistent with the reported high rates of attrition among
foreign medical school graduates in US residency pro-
grams, the reported clash of cultures between immi-
grants and US citizens, and possible discrimination.31
Higher income is associated with increased likeli-
hood of being very satisfied and a decreased likelihood
of being dissatisfied. The income odds ratios also tend
to rise or fall monotonically and generate relatively nar-
row confidence intervals compared with all other covar-
iates. These results are consistent with the view that feel-
ing adequately rewarded in financial terms is an important
part of overall career satisfaction.
COMPARISON WITH LITERATURE
McMurray et al1 analyzed 5704 male and female physi-
cians in the Physician Work Life Study, with a concern
for sex differences. They found that women were more
likely than men to be dissatisfied. We found women to
be neither more nor less likely than men to report being
very satisfied or dissatisfied. McMurray et al1 did not dis-
cuss associations between either satisfaction or burnout
on one hand and specialty on the other.
Schulz et al5 reported results on 545 physicians in
Dane County, Wisconsin. They created only 14 spe-
cialty categories (eg, general surgery, general internal
medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, and family practice).
After adjusting for control variables such as age, sex,
employment in a health maintenance organization, and
solo practice, they found only 1 statistically significant
difference: psychiatrists reported less career satisfaction
than surgeons. But there are limitations to the study by
Schulz et al.5 They surveyed physicians in only 1 county
in Wisconsin, and the data were from 1986. They did not
control for as many variables as we did. Finally, they con-
sidered 14 specialties. We considered 33.
Frank et al2 analyzed a nationally representative
sample of 4501 US female physicians. They considered
18 specialties. Frank et al2 did not seek to produce a rank-
ing of specialties as we did. In multivariate regressions
that included a number of covariates (age, work hours,
number of children in family), no statistically signifi-
cant differences across specialties were found. How-
ever, age was found to be positively and statistically sig-
nificant in its association with high satisfaction. Marital
status was not found to be statistically significant. They
found that 31% of female physicians had seriously con-
sidered leaving medicine.
IMPLICATIONS
Our results might be useful to medical students making
career decisions. Presumably, students would want a spe-
cialty for which a high percentage of incumbents are very
satisfied and/or a low percentage are dissatisfied, other
things being equal.
These results will also be of interest to specialty soci-
etiesconcernedwithboththewellbeingoftheirmembers
and the attractiveness of their specialty to future genera-
tionsofstudents.Somespecialtiesalreadyconductdetailed
surveys of practitioner satisfaction and have used the re-
sults to help plan interventions at the individual, organi-
zational,andpoliticallevels.2,6 Totheextentthatpervasive
discontent may be associated with adverse organizational
and patient outcomes, these results should be of interest
to managers, policy makers, and residence training direc-
tors. For example, if discontent continues within some
specialties,notonlywillfewerstudentschoosethatspecialty,
but some incumbents will exit it. In the language of

forebecomesevenmoreimportantinmedicinethanother

ers to take note of trends in specialty satisfaction and de-
signinterventionstoensureequilibriumbetweendemand
and supply.
The experience of anesthesiologists during the 1990s,
when this specialty lost some of its appeal, should serve
as a warning. It is generally acknowledged that a miscal-
culation of demand within an influential study, loss of
job autonomy, and income left students fearful of select-
ing this specialty.32,33
Another implication involves the future mix of spe-
cialists in the United States.9 If specialties that register high
on dissatisfaction are likely to shrink, our results are im-
portant for forecasting the future mix of specialists.
Finally, of particular interest is the potential effect
on quality of care that results when a high percentage of
physicians in otolaryngology, obstetrics-gynecology, oph-
thalmology, orthopedic surgery, and internal medicine
are dissatisfied. The health of the public, in general, may
worsen.
LIMITATIONS AND STRENGTHS
We begin with limitations. First, the data are self-
reported. However, this is true for all survey data sets.
Moreover, only the physician knows his or her level of
satisfaction.
Second, the data are cross-sectional so that causal
relations are subject to interpretation. For example, the
rural/town variable is consistent and strongly statisti-
cally significant in its positive correlation with very sat-
isfied. We cannot determine, however, whether it is work
in rural areas that improves satisfaction or whether it is
the type of physician (already satisfied) who chooses to
live in a rural area. Similar problems plague the inter-
pretation of the strongly statistically significant correla-
tions for the board-certified, foreign medical school gradu-
ate, geographic region, and full owner variables. These
correlations, again, could reflect self-selection. Never-
theless, a number of authors have assigned a casual in-
terpretation to the correlation between being a full owner
and dissatisfaction. According to these authors, it is being
a full owner in the age of managed care that leads to lower
satisfaction.21
But our focus is not on rural residence, region, sole
proprietorship, or managed care. We enter each of these

as control variables in our analyses. We are interested in
producing the first ranking of specialties according to sat-
isfaction using the CTS data. Future researchers may im-
prove on these rankings with longitudinal data or more
sophisticated statistical models.
Third, the data are limited in that some variables are
not available. Physician demographic characteristics such
as race, marital status, and number of children in the fam-
ily have been shown to correlate with satisfaction and
are standard covariates in economic studies of labor
markets.2,30 Finally, income is recorded in crude $50000
increments in the CTS.
Fourth, response rates may differ across specialty. But
this is true for any covariate. The CTS administrators
maintain that these data are representative of physicians
in the nation.20 Finally, we do not analyze specialties
with fewer than 40 incumbents.
Fifth, little solid evidence exists regarding why any
specialty would rank high or low. But the CTS data are
highly regarded, and the results on the control variables
are believable (eg, experience with managed care, being
a foreign graduate, and increased work hours are asso-
ciated with dissatisfaction, whereas higher income and
being young are associated with high satisfaction). We
conclude that whereas the reasons for given specialties
being high or low on the list may not be clear, the list is
likely to be accurate and will generate future research into
discovering those reasons.
There are also strengths of this study. First, the CTS
data set is large and designed to represent the nation. The
sample size of the CTS is larger than any previous data
set used to analyze physician career satisfaction. Sec-
ond, we control for most of the variables identified in the
literature. Third, we consider more specialties than any
prior study. Fourth, our findings (with respect to pedi-
atrics and obstetrics-gynecology, for example) are con-
sistent with contemporary impressions of satisfaction
across specialties, thus leading credibility to our study.
Finally, the data set is highly regarded and has been pro-
ductively analyzed within other rigorous studies.21,28
CONCLUSIONS
We used a large, nationally representative sample of phy-
sicians to assess differences in career satisfaction across
33 specialties. Considerable variations were found; phy-
sicians were not equally satisfied. These results may serve
to bring greater research and policy attention to why some
specialists derive considerably more satisfaction from their
work than others.
