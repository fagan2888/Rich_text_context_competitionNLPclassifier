Abstract
Background: Multimorbidity defined as the "the coexistence of two or more chronic diseases" in one individual, is
increasing in prevalence globally. The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of multimorbidity across low
and middle-income countries (LMICs), and to investigate patterns by age and education, as a proxy for socio-economic
status (SES).
Methods: Chronic disease data from 28 countries of the World Health Survey (2003) were extracted and inter-country
socio-economic differences were examined by gross domestic product (GDP). Regression analyses were applied to
examine associations of education with multimorbidity by region adjusted for age and sex distributions.
Results: The mean world standardized multimorbidity prevalence for LMICs was 7.8 % (95 % CI, 7.79 % - 7.83 %). In all
countries, multimorbidity increased significantly with age. A positive but non­linear relationship was found between
country GDP and multimorbidity prevalence. Trend analyses of multimorbidity by education suggest that there are
intergenerational differences, with a more inverse education gradient for younger adults compared to older adults.
Higher education was significantly associated with a decreased risk of multimorbidity in the all-region analyses.
Conclusions: Multimorbidity is a global phenomenon, not just affecting older adults in HICs. Policy makers worldwide
need to address these health inequalities, and support the complex service needs of a growing multimorbid population.
Keywords: Multimorbidity, Ageing, Health inequalities, Epidemiological transition, Adult health
Background
The theory of epidemiological transition is grounded on
the observed shift of disease burden from communicable
to non-communicable disease (NCD) causes [1]. Whilst
the debate about the role of population ageing in epi-
demiological transition continues, the demographic tran-
sition to older populations is also occurring across all
regions, albeit with different patterns, determinants and
rapidity. It has been shown that the ageing of popula-
tions is ongoing in both developed and developing coun-
tries although, the growth rate of older adults in low- and
middle-income countries will remain significantly higher
than in most high-income countries (HICs) for many
decades [2]. Multimorbidity is usually defined as the pres-
ence of two or more chronic diseases within an individual
[3]. Although chronic disease factors are considered
drivers of multimorbidity, the observed increase in multi-
morbidity is also related to both the demographic and epi-
demiologic transition. As the global population continues
to grow in size, and becomes increasingly aged, there is an
expectant increase in multimorbidity prevalence. Tackling
multimorbidity as part of NCD burden remains one of the
key challenges faced by the global community. In particu-
lar, health systems need to examine its socio-economic de-
terminants in order to provide the most equitable health
care to their populations and to drive NCD prevention.
Despite the growing recognition of the prevalence of
multimorbidity amongst older adults, global prevalence
studies have largely remained single-disease focused [4].

Few studies have reported national level estimates.
Population prevalence studies in Spain and Germany
suggest that multimorbidity prevalence is approximately
60 % for people aged 65 years and above [5, 6]. While the
focus on older adults is common, multimorbidity also af-
fects younger adults [7]. A study in Australia reported a
multimorbidity prevalence of approximately 4 % in adults
aged 20­39 years, 15 % in the 40­59 age group, and 39 %
in those aged 60 and older [8]. There are also contrasting
associations by age and sex. Multimorbidity in HICs is re-
portedly more prevalent for individuals of higher ages, fe-
male sex, low income, and low education [9­11]. The
outcomes of multimorbidity have been well documented in
HICs, with multimorbidity being associated with reduced
quality of life, decreased functional capacity, and reduced
survival [12­14]. Studies have also shown the burden of
multimorbidity and its relation to rising healthcare utilisa-
tion, cost and expenditure [15, 16]. A comparison of the
relationship between multimorbidity and socio-economic
status (SES) show contrasting results for high, middle and
low income countries. In Scotland, a high income country,
multimorbidity has been found to be associated with lower
SES [17]. In Bangladesh, a low income country - however,
the wealthiest quintile of the population had an increased
prevalence of multimorbidity [18]. And in studies examin-
ing its association with education, multimorbidity was
more prevalent in those with lower educational levels in
Canada (a HIC) [11]; while multimorbidity was less com-
mon among educated and employed persons in South
Africa (an upper-middle income country) [19].
There have been no studies examining the age and so-
cioeconomic distribution of multimorbidity (MM) in
LMICs. The present study aims to establish the prevalence
of MM in a range of LMICs, and to examine the varia-
tions of MM by age and education (as a proxy for SES).
Methods
Study samples
Publically available data from the WHO World Health
Survey (WHS) was used, which is publicly available from
the WHO. The World Health Surveys consists of cross-
sectional national studies, each of which follow a multi-
stage clustering design to draw nationally representative
samples of adults aged 18 years and older. The details of
the survey procedures are described elsewhere [20, 21].
Seventy-one countries participated in the WHS between
2001 and 2004. Sample sizes varied between countries
depending on feasibility and cost. Individual participants
aged 18 years or above were randomly selected for inter-
view. All surveys were implemented as face-to-face in-
terviews; except for two countries, which used phone
and mail-in interviews.
Of the seventy-one countries that participated in the
WHS, eighteen countries were excluded from the analyses,
as they did not complete the long version of the question-
naire covering chronic condition status; these were mostly
countries from Western Europe. Countries were also ex-
cluded if the response rate to the chronic health questions
was less than 90 % (eleven countries) or if they did not in-
clude post-stratification weights (six countries). A mini-
mum of four countries were randomly selected from each
region for further analysis, resulting in a total of twenty-
eight of the remaining thirty-seven countries. Since the re-
search questions aimed to address the differences between
LMICs the majority of countries sampled were LMICs.
Due to low response rates in certain regions, such as
Africa, countries from Eastern Europe & Central Asia were
oversampled. We included one high income countries for
comparison. In total, six countries were randomly selected
from Africa; five countries from South-East Asia; four from
South Asia; eight from Eastern Europe & Central Asia; four
from Central & South America; and, one from Western
Europe. Sampling weights were applied, as well as post-
stratification weights to account for non-response.
Measures and variables
In the WHS, chronic disease morbidity was defined by
self-report, based on a set of six doctor diagnosed condi-
tions. The self-reported conditions were assessed based
on responses to the question, "Have you ever been diag-
nosed with...?" Previous studies have used different oper-
ational definitions of multimorbidity. Methodological
differences, such as the number of chronic conditions to
include in the count, result in a wide variability in preva-
lence estimates [7]. To prevent further discordance, mul-
timorbidity is defined here as the presence of two or
more chronic diseases, which is the most commonly
used definition in prevalence studies [22]. A binary vari-
able for multimorbidity was created on the presence of
two or more of the six conditions: arthritis, angina or
angina pectoris (a heart disease), asthma, depression,
schizophrenia or psychosis, and diabetes.
The individual level socio-demographic variables of
interest were age, sex and highest level of education
completed. The residence of the individual, defined as
living in either an `urban' or `rural' area, was also used in
the description of the country characteristics. Two dif-
ferent age groupings were generated for different ana-
lyses: first, three age groupings for those 18­49 years,
50­64 years and 65+ years; and then by two groups for
those younger than 55 (18­54 years) and those aged
55 years or older. The former was done to examine
stratum specific differences, and the latter to examine
generational differences. To examine generational differ-
ences, 55 years was taken as a cut point, representing a
mid-way point within the WHS study population.
Level of education was used as a measure of country-
level socioeconomic status (SES). `Highest education level

obtained' was collapsed from seven to four categories: (1)
university or any higher education; (2) secondary school;
(3) primary school; and, (4) less than primary school (in-
cluding no formal education).
Inter-country socioeconomic differences were examined
by using country estimates for GDP per capita. These
were obtained from the United Nations Statistical Division
records for 2003. Countries were then grouped according
to the cut-offs for low- middle- and high-income based on
the World Bank classification figures in 2003 [23].
Statistical analysis
Survey estimates were used to calculate prevalence mea-
sures and extract nationally representative samples, ac-
counting for non-response. To obtain valid comparisons
across the countries, age-standardised multimorbidity
prevalence rates were calculated using the direct method
with the WHO Standard Population (2000­2025) [24].
For the descriptive analyses, mean percentages were
taken as an average across populations and normality of
the distributions was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
We used non-parametric regression to produce a line of
best fit, when comparing national estimates of multimor-
bidity with GDP. Individual countries were weighted by
the survey size to produce regional estimates for com-
parisons of multimorbidity by age and education. Signifi-
cance testing of the comparisons among independent
samples was done by t-test or ANOVA while for those
whose distributions deviated from the normal one - by
the Wilcoxon rank-sum (for two variables) and

`Prevalence ratios' of multimorbidity by education were
calculated with the reference category being primary
school education completion. Univariable models were
fitted to analyse the association of both sex and age
with multimorbidity. For the multivariable analyses,
data were pooled at regional level. A random effects lo-
gistic regression model was fitted for the regional ana-
lysis, to account for the hierarchical nature of the data
within countries and regions. Odds ratios (OR) and
95 % confidence intervals (CI) are presented, with p <
0.05 taken as statistically significant, unless stated
otherwise. All analyses were done using Stata version
12. Confidence intervals have been calculated based on
recommendations for crude and age-specific rates [25].
Results
Individual country characteristics are described in Table 1.
Socio-demographic characteristics, including age and sex
distributions are shown. Population age structures differed
across the countries (p < 0.05), with a mean percentage
of 9.0 % (95 % CI, 7.1 ­ 11.0) in those aged 65+ com-
pared to 72.0 % (95 % CI, 68.4 ­ 75.7) in those aged
18­49. Age-standardisation of rates were calculated to
account for these population distribution differences.
The mean percentage of those living in rural areas was
49.2 % (95 % CI, 41.3 -57.1) compared to 50.8 % in
urban areas (95 % CI, 42.9 -58.7), although the difference
was not significant. Countries in Central Asia & Eastern
Europe region had a higher proportion of individuals in
the 65+ age category (mean = 14.6 %; 95 % CI, 12.5­ 16.7)

compared to the African region (mean = 5.3 %; 95 % CI,
4.1 ­ 6.4; p < 0.05).
Individual morbidity estimates suggest that arthritis is
the most common condition across the WHS countries,
with mean prevalence of 12.0 % (95 % CI, 11.8 - 12.2).
The mean prevalence for depression, angina, asthma,
diabetes and schizophrenia, respectively, were 6.7 %,
7.5 %, 5.0 %, 4.0 % and 0.9 % [see Additional file 1]. Mul-
timorbidity prevalences by country are shown in Table 2.
Both age-specific prevalences and age standardized
prevalence are shown for each country. The mean world
standardized prevalence for LMICs was 7.8 % (95 % CI,
6.5 ­ 9.1) and the range was 1.7 % (95 % CI, 1.4-2.0) to
15.2 % (14.3 ­ 16.0). The mean multimorbidity preva-
lence significantly increased with age in all countries
(p < 0.05); 3.8 % (95 % CI, 3.0 ­ 4.6) for age 18­49,
12.8 % (95 % CI, 10.5 ­ 15.2) for 50­64; and 21.3 %
(95 % CI, 17.1 ­ 25.5) for 65 + .
Figure 1 shows national levels of multimorbidity by
country GDP per capita. There was a positive association
between multimorbidity prevalence and GDP per capita
(from GDP per capita of $200 ­ $10,000). Above
$10,000 the line flattens: Spain had a relatively low mul-
timorbidity prevalence given their high GDP per capita.
Figure 2 shows the prevalence ratios of multimorbidity
across socioeconomic groups, stratified into younger and
older adults. Amongst the younger adults, across all re-
gions, there was a distinct negative socioeconomic gradi-
ent, with the highest burden on the least educated. In
Western Europe there appeared to be a wider variation
between SES categories, compared to SE Asia and Africa.
Amongst older adults, there was less variation between
SES categories, compared to the younger adults. However,
there was still a distinct negative gradient in Western
Europe, with the highest burden on the least educated.
South-East Asia on the other hand has a positive gradient,
with the highest burden on the most educated.
Both univariable and multivariable analyses are shown
in Tables 3 and 4. Univariable and multivariable analyses
at the country level are shown in Table 3, showing the
sociodemographic correlates of age, sex and education.
Age was significantly associated with multimorbidity in

all countries. Sex was significantly associated with multi-
morbidity in all but seven countries. Multimorbidity was
associated with education in the univariable analyses,
but was not significant when adjusted for both age and
sex, except for certain education categories in
Bangladesh, Brazil, Hungary, Mauritius, Namibia and
Spain; which were all consistent with an inverse
relationship.
Similar to the country level, age and sex were both sig-
nificantly associated with multimorbidity in all regions
(Table 4). When adjusted for age and sex, the lowest
education category was significantly associated with a
higher risk of multimorbidity in Africa and Western
Europe; and higher education categories were signifi-
cantly associated with a decreased risk of multimorbidity
in South Asia and Western Europe. Adjusted for age,
sex, country and region, the `all region' model suggests
an overall negative education gradient.
Discussion
The subject of multimorbidity is of growing interest, in
part, due to the ageing of all populations. Internationally,
there is still limited evidence on the prevalence and
social determinants of multimorbidity, particularly in
LMICs. This is the first study to describe global patterns
of multimorbidity and to compare prevalence across
different countries including LMICs. There are a few
notable findings. Firstly, despite the variation in multi-
morbidity prevalence the mean world standard preva-
lence for LMICs was 7.8 % (95 % CI, 6.5 ­ 9.1), so even
in LMICs the multimorbidity prevalence was quite
high. Secondly, multimorbidity prevalence was posi-
tively associated with country GDP per capita. There
was however a non-linear relationship; our one HIC -
Spain had a low multimorbidity relative to per capita
GDP. These results suggest an influence of other factors
which may include, but are not limited to, more freedom
to make better lifestyle choices and better social condi-
tions [26]. In comparison to Spain, the Eastern European
countries have relatively high multimorbidity preva-
lence. Historically, Eastern Europe has had poorer
population health outcomes relative to their western
counterparts following the fall of communism in 1990.
Such health outcomes were markedly influenced by ex-
posure to risk factors, such as tobacco smoking and al-
cohol consumption [27­29]. Thirdly, multimorbidity

was significantly associated with age across all countries
including LMICs. This finding has been found consist-
ently across several studies [9, 17, 30­34]. Fourthly,
multimorbidity as defined here, is also not limited to
older adults, but affects younger adults in LMICs. This
association of multimorbidity with age, however, might
reflect the type of condition included in the disease
count and their age of onset [35]. Fifthly, trend analyses
of multimorbidity and education suggest a transgenera-
tional difference: with a transition to a more negative
education gradient is observed for younger adults com-
pared to older adults in LMICs. Our `all region' model
also suggests an inverse relationship between multimor-
bidity and education. These findings are consistent with
what has been found in other studies in HICs [17, 32].
Finally, there are notable gender differences in multi-
morbidity: the female sex being associated with higher
multimorbidity. This is a common observation in mor-
bidity studies, often attributed to greater use of health
services and disease diagnosis [33]. Though other
studies also suggest the role of other factors, including
behavioural and psychosocial [34, 36]. Other studies
suggest that clustering patterns of multimorbidity differ
for male and females; for example, the cardiometabolic
cluster was reportedly more common in males. This
occurrence could be due to known differences in physi-
ology, such as the protective effect of female hormones
on CVD [37].

One of the study aims was to examine the variations
of multimorbidity by SES here with education as a
proxy. Our descriptive analyses of education show that
both regional differences and generational differences
exist for adults with multimorbidity. In Western Europe
and Eastern Europe & Central Asia, there was wider
variation in prevalence ratios between SES categories,
compared to other regions. And for adults aged
<55 years, the gradient was always negative, with one ex-
ception of older adults in South-East Asia. This suggests
that in South-East Asia there might have been an inter-
generational reversal in the socioeconomic gradient of
multimorbidity. Such results have also been found in
studies on obesity where transitional economies are ex-
periencing a reversal in socioeconomic gradient thus
resulting in a similar gradient to HICs [38].
The global-level multivariable analyses show a negative
association of multimorbidity with education. Results
from Western Europe (Spain) suggest a significantly
negative education gradient of multimorbidity in HICs.
In Africa, there is also a significantly negative education
gradient in multimorbidity. The education gradient in
Africa, despite most countries in this region being
LMICs, is similar to the Western Europe region. These
results are contrary to the Bangladesh study, which sam-
pled 850 individuals (60 years and above) in a rural area
and reported a direct association of multimorbidity with
SES [18]. The SES index in their study, however, was
based on household assets. Alternative measures of SES
may lead to different results. One study in rural Uganda
reports maternal education to be a better predictor of
health; whereas other studies explore the use of perman-
ent income [39, 40].
Strengths and limitations
This study provides novel data on multimorbidity preva-
lence in nationally representative population samples using
a consistent set of methods measures across multiple
countries. Being the first of its kind, one of its major
strengths is the availability and comparability of the data
across all a wide range of countries using the World Health
Surveys which were developed for this reason.
The study has few limitations which, even if not
undermining its contributions and potential impact,
should be also mentioned. Firstly, prevalence estimates
were based on a limited set of conditions [7]. The
chronic conditions included in the WHS were chosen to
reflect health system coverage [41]. The conditions had
to be amenable to self-report and reflect a known bur-
den or prevalence globally. The choice of conditions
should correspond to those with greater prevalence in
older populations (prevalence for asthma, for instance,
is more typically higher in older children and younger
adulthood). Secondly, the study presents cross-
sectional data from 2003. Further investigations should
use current or recent data, as well as longitudinal data,
to ascertain changing patterns over time. Thirdly, only
countries with a greater than 90 % response rate to
health status questions on chronic disease were sam-
pled, which meant that a number of lower income
countries, where response rates were low, were ex-
cluded from the analyses. There was also low represen-
tation from HICs, as these countries largely did not
complete the chronic disease questions. As such the
use of Spain only ­ to represent Western Europe ­
was a limitation. Fourthly, these results were based on
self-reported measures, which may result in disease
underreporting and potential bias [42­44]. One study
notes that self-reporting leads to underreporting, par-
ticularly amongst the poor, which dampen the gradi-
ents [45]. It may be that health literacy and service
access impact prevalence based on self-report for
countries at different levels of economic development.
Self-reported diagnosis can be further validated by

auxiliary symptom-reporting questions included in the
survey, such as the Rose questionnaire used for angina,
or through clinical assessment [46]. National GDP is
generally correlated with healthcare system investment
and potentially healthcare access, which might affect
the interpretation of the results. Spain, however, had
low multimorbidity relative to national GDP despite
having a relatively good healthcare system access. In
order to understand the relationship between a coun-
try's development and multimorbidity as an appropri-
ate health outcome, further studies are needed: with a
fuller accounting of confounding, modifying and medi-
ating elements. Finally the use of education as a proxy
for SES has been debated despite its wide use in popu-
lation health research [47, 48]. There is evidence to
suggest that after conditioning for the effect of socio-
economic status, measured by household income or
assets, education has an independent and substantial
effect on health outcomes [49].
Conclusion
Multimorbidity is common in LMICs and significantly
associated with age. There is an inverse country associ-
ation of multimorbidity with education, which indicates
an inequity of disease burden. The negative gradient of
multimorbidity with education is already occurring and
more marked in the younger generation. It may reflect
the proliferation of several key risk factors for these
chronic conditions including unhealthy behaviours. The
recent UN World Summit addressed the common risk
factors of NCDs to be tackled with urgent priority;
namely tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alco-
hol and physical inactivity [50]. Weak health systems
and governance will not be able to support the care
needs resulting from the complexities of a multimorbid
population. Better coordination and support through in-
formed policy and planning of health care systems is
needed to support the transition required for health sys-
tems to address future care needs. Furthermore, there is
a need to increase activities and expand measures to re-
duce the modifiable risk factors that are driving multi-
morbidity prevalence.
