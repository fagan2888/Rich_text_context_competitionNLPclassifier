Older Parents' Expectations
of Moving Closer to Their Children

Research shows that older parents engage in return migration in order to live closer to childrenfrom whom they re-
ceive care. However, less is known about how characteristics of adult children influence this process. Data for this
analysis are from 5,382 older parents participating in the 1993/4 AHEAD national survey of adults aged 70 years
old and older. Findings demonstrate that elderly parents who expect to move closer to adult children tend to be
older, female, and have at least one child who is better-off financially than they are. Living alone magnifies the ef-
fect ofpoor self-rated health on expecting to move closer to a child. Random effects modeling of children's charac-
teristics reveals that parents are more likely to expect to move closer to a daughter than to a son. Greater parental
functional impairment was found to further depress the selection of sons. Overall, the findings suggest that older
parents expect to move closer to adult children out of need and tend to select a target child with greater potential to
provide support.
OVER the last decade considerable attention has been
devoted to understanding the role that geographic dis-
tance plays in the maintenance of intergenerational ex-
changes in the older family. Research has shown that inter-
action and transfers of assistance across generations are
very sensitive to the geographic distance between older
parents and their adult children. For instance, Litwak and
Kulis (1987) found that the proportion of parents receiving
instrumental assistance dropped from 70% to 30% when
the primary helper went from being ten blocks away to
being just 30 minutes away. Research demonstrates that
older parents who live closer to their children also have
more contact with them (Bengtson & Roberts, 1991; DeWit
& Frankel, 1988), have greater affection for them (Lawton,
Silverstein, & Bengtson, 1994), and tend to be more in-
volved with their grandchildren (Cherlin & Furstenberg,
1986). Thus, geographic proximity is a key variable in
structuring opportunities for intergenerational exchange,
interaction, and cohesion in the older family. Yet we know
relatively little about the dynamic nature of geographic
distance between intergenerational family members and
the mechanisms by which intergenerational proximity is
achieved. In this article, we use nationally representative
data to examine the factors that shape the expectations of
older parents of moving closer to their adult children and to
better understand how the child-selection process is guided
by both parents' and children's characteristics.
Geographic Mobility and Intergenerational Distance
Geographic separation of adult generations and residen-
tial independence of elderly adults have been taken by some
scholars as evidence that the intergenerational family is in
decline, and therefore unable to ensure the well-being of its
members (Popenoe, 1993). Indeed, over the last century
older parents have become increasingly more likely to live
independently of their children (Thornton & Freedman,
1985), and there is some evidence of decline (between 1962
and 1984) in the proportion of elderly parents who live near
their adult children (Crimmins & Ingegneri, 1990). How-
ever, an alternative perspective posits that the family is re-
silient to earlier geographic dispersion by reconstituting it-
self in reaction to (or in anticipation of) the vulnerabilities
of its older relatives (Litwak, 1985). This phenomenon of
"return" migration (geographic mobility of older adults to
communities where relatives reside) has been demonstrated
in studies of migration streams which show that older peo-
ple who move from the Sunbelt to the Frostbelt are less
healthy than those moving in the reverse direction (Litwak
& Longino, 1988; Serrow & Charity, 1988).
The theoretical underpinnings of return migration are de-
veloped by Litwak and colleagues, who propose that dis-
abled elderly persons require frequent instrumental services
that only proximate informal care providers, most often
spouses and adult children, can provide most effectively
and efficiently (see Litwak & Kulis, 1987). Thus, return
migration typically occurs when disability in conjunction
with widowhood motivates older people to move to com-
munities where their children or other relatives can care for
them. Evidence from a variety of demographic and family
studies demonstrates that elderly adults are able to adapt
their residential circumstances to meet the needs of chang-
ing physical and social conditions. Findings from several
longitudinal studies of household dynamics of elderly peo-
ple demonstrate that diminished functional capacity and
being either unmarried or a recent widow, or living alone
increases the likelihood of moving from an independent
household to a shared residence with adult children or
other adults (Speare, Avery, & Lawton, 1991; Spitze, Lo-
gan, & Robinson, 1992; Worobey & Angel, 1990). In addi-
tion, studies examining geographic distance between gener-
ations over time have found older parents in poor and
declining health to be more likely to converge with adult
children, suggesting that increases in proximity are also
motivated by parents' needs for assistance (Clark & Wolf,
S153
S154 SILVERSTEIN AND ANGELELLI
1992; Silverstein, 1995). However, DeJong and colleagues
(1995), in examining retrospective attributions for mobility
behavior among older persons age 70 and older, found that
a substantial proportion of elderly migrants moved in order
to live closer to (and affiliate more frequently with) family
members, but not necessarily to receive assistance with a
health-related dependency. Their findings suggest that fac-
tors other than physical health play roles in motivating
return migration.
In this analysis we advance understanding of the dynam-
ics of elderly return migration in several ways. First, unlike
other studies, we examine characteristics of older parents as
well as those of their children to assess mobility decisions
in later life. Whereas most research on return migration has
focused on the needs and resources of the elderly persons
(i.e., "push" factors), much less attention has been paid to
the social characteristics of children who are the targets of
return migration (i.e., "pull" factors). Children's character-
istics are important to consider as they reflect the benefits
parents anticipate through geographic convergence with
their adult offspring. For instance, frail older parents may
perceive daughters and those children with greater financial
and housing resources as better equipped to meet their
needs for care and supervision.
Second, we conceptualize the process of geographic con-
vergence with children as comprising three implicit deci-
sions made by older parents: (1) deciding whether to move,
(2) deciding whether to move toward a child, and (3) decid-
ing which child or children to move toward (among those
with two or more children). Although these three decisions
are made virtually together in practice, we treat them as
distinct because each may be guided by unique motivations
(for a related discussion, see Petersen, 1988). For example,
we predict that good health enhances the geographic mobil-
ity of older parents, but we also hypothesize that among
those parents who expect to move, poor health enhances
their desire to move closer to adult children. With respect to
the third decision, we predict that the availability of "suit-
able" children will form the basis for choosing those with
whom proximity is preferred.
A third innovation of this analysis is that we consider all
adult children in modeling which of their characteristics are
associated with their parents' expectations for greater prox-
imity. We use procedures that have desirable statistical
properties in the analysis of data structures where children
are nested hierarchically within families. Such approaches
produce parameter estimates that explicitly model how par-
ent-based choice strategies are dependent on their chil-
dren's characteristics and how parents' characteristics pro-
duce variations in those choice strategies.
In this research we examine the future expectations of
older parents to move closer to, or in with, their adult chil-
dren. It is important to note that while stated expectations
reflect current states of mind with respect to residential
mobility, it is almost axiomatic that they will correlate im-
perfectly with actual mobility. Subsequent behavior may
deviate from expectations in several ways. First, current cir-
cumstances of parents and of children may change over
time--unexpectedly blocking or triggering geographic mo-
bility. Second, expectations of moving closer to children
are colored by subjective appraisals and values such as
norms of familism (the degree to which family obligation is
considered important), preferences for autonomy/depen-
dency in intergenerational relations, self-assessment of
future needs, and anticipation that alternatives to adult chil-
dren will or will not be available. We suggest that expec-
tations are important to study, not only because of their
ability to predict future mobility, but because they are infor-
mative about the perceived salience of adult children as po-
tential or preferred resources--even if those expectations
go unfulfilled in the immediate future.
There are several issues with respect to our operational-
ization of return migration that deserve discussion. Return
migration has been operationalized variously in the empiri-
cal literature as interstate migration, residential mobility,
changing household composition, and convergence of el-
derly adults with family members. The phenomenon is
interpreted less frequently as the literal return to a home
community than as the restoration of earlier social arrange-
ments. In our study, we take this broader view by consider-
ing return migration as the geographic convergence of
elderly parents with their children, which revives or ap-
proximates an earlier nuclear family arrangement.
Given our focus on intergenerational geographic conver-
gence as a manifestation of return migration, we think it
important to acknowledge that the mobility intentions of
older parents, but not of their adult children, are observed
in the present study. Because parental expectations for the
mobility of children may blunt their desire to move closer
to children, we are likely to underestimate the strength with
which these parents are predisposed to living closer to chil-
dren. Although we are able to compensate for the conse-
quences of past mobility by controlling for baseline dis-
tances from children, we cannot account for parents who
desire greater proximity through the mobility of their chil-
dren. Therefore, our measure of intended geographic con-
vergence will be underestimated to the extent that parents
expect their children to move closer to them.
In our analysis, we address three general research ques-
tions: (1) How do physical and cognitive impairments in
conjunction with living arrangements influence the expecta-
tions of older people to move closer to or in with their chil-
dren? (2) How do the social and economic characteristics of
individual adult children influence which one(s) their par-
ents expect to move closer to or in with? (3) How do par-
ents' characteristics influence the criteria they use to select
which child(ren) they expect to move closer to or in with?
METHOD
Sample
The data used in this analysis are drawn from the Asset
and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD), a na-
tional probability sample of 8,223 noninstitutionalized
household residents at least 70 years of age and their
spouses. Fielded in 1993-94 with a response rate of 80%,
the survey consists of telephone interviews (72% of those
participants age 80 and older) and personal interviews
(70% of those participants ages 70-79). The sample in-
cludes supplemental oversamples of Blacks, Hispanics, and
EXPECTATIONS OF MOVING CLOSER TO CHILDREN S155
residents of Florida. The content of the survey principally
focused on the domains of health, financial well-being, and
family relations of the elderly participants.
Because this analysis focuses on the older parents' ex-
pectations of moving closer to their children, we selected
an analytic sample of 4,655 respondents who had at least
one surviving child and who did not live with a child at the
time of the survey. We omitted parents who coresided with
a child because they had no opportunity to achieve addi-
tional geographic proximity. Spouses of household mem-
bers who were under 70 years of age and proxy respondents
were also dropped from our analysis.
Characteristics of the analytic sample and distributions of
key study variables are found in Table 1. Normalized
weights provided by AHEAD are applied in order to com-
pensate for the oversampling and to ensure that the analytic
sample reflects a nationally representative profile. Three out
of five parents in our analytic sample (61%) are female, and
slightly more than one quarter (28%) are at least 80 years
old (average age is 78 years). Seven percent are African
American and 3% are Hispanic, and 63% graduated from
high school. Forty-three percent live alone and 69% own
their homes. In terms of health status, almost one quarter
(24%) of the sample have difficulty with one or more activ-
ities of daily living (ADL), and 31% rate their health as fair
or poor. The distribution of a performance-based measure
of cognitive impairment, ranging from 0 to 25, reveals that
13.3% of respondents answered more than half the test
items incorrectly (average number incorrect is 8.2). Aggre-
gate characteristics of children are also shown in Table 1.
Half of the parents (50%) have only one or two living chil-
dren, 79% have at least one daughter, 57% live within 10
miles of at least one child, and 72% have at least one child
who is better-off financially than they are.
Dependent Variables
As discussed earlier, we conceptualize the decision to
move closer to adult children as comprising three distinct
and hierarchical sets of expectations. Respondents were
first asked to rate the certainty of their expectations for
moving in the next 5 years on a scale of 0 to 100%, with
higher values indicating greater certainty. Those who rated
their certainty as 20% or higher were considered to be
at risk of moving and were asked follow-up questions
concerning their expected moves. Thus, we used the 20%
threshold to create a binary variable for the expectation to
move. By this criterion threshold, 26.6% of our sample of
older parents expected to move in the next 5 years.
The second stage of the analysis (conditional on having
expressed at least 20% expectation of moving) predicts
whether older parents expect to move closer to or in with a
child; we determined that 51% have such an expectation.
The third stage of the analysis (conditional on expecting to
move closer to a child) predicts which child or children par-
ents would choose as those they expect to move closer to or
in with.
It should be noted that our choice of 20% as a threshold for
assessing the certainty of moving was based on survey proto-
cols; therefore follow-up questions about expected moves
were asked only of respondents who were above this crite-

rion value. Nevertheless, we were cautious in applying this
threshold and performed additional tests to detect possible bi-
ases that might be related to its use. These include (1) per-
forming comparable analyses using a 50% threshold and (2)
including the raw percentage as a control variable in second-
and third-stage equations. Our results indicated that estimated
equations and their interpretations were little changed by
these modifications. Therefore, we used a 20% cutoff in order
to maximize the information available for our analyses.
Independent variables.--The following demographic
and socioeconomic characteristics of older parents were
tested as independent variables in predicting mobility ex-
pectations (reference categories in parentheses): female
(male), living alone (living with others), African American
and Hispanic (White non-Hispanic), age, number of chil-
dren, home ownership (renting), the log of household in-
come, and years of formal education. Health variables in-
clude instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),
activities of daily living (ADLs), self-rated health, and cog-
nitive impairment. IADL is measured as the total number of
the following activities reported as difficult to perform:
meal preparation, shopping, using the telephone, managing
money, and taking medication. ADL is measured as the
total number of the following activities reported as difficult
to perform: bathing, toileting, dressing, eating, walking,
and bed transferring. Self-rated health is measured on a
scale ranging from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Cognitive im-
pairment is measured as a composite index consisting of
tests of memory and other forms of performance-based
mental functioning; possible scores range from 0-25, with
higher scores indicating greater impairment.
Other independent variables are specific to the equation
being estimated. In predicting the expectation of moving in
the next five years, we included three indicators of housing
and neighborhood characteristics: perceived condition of
current housing (scored 1-5, with 1 = excellent and 5 =
very poor); perceived neighborhood safety (scored 1-5,
with 1 = very safe and 5 = very unsafe); and length of time
in current housing (scored dichotomously, with 0 = less
than 10 years and 1 = 10 years or more).
We also included summary characteristics of adult chil-
dren as predictors of whether parents expect to move closer
to or in with their children. These variables, which indicate
the availability of particular types of children, include the
following dichotomously scored items (reference groups in
parentheses): having at least one child who is perceived as
being better-off financially than the parent (not having such
a child); having at least one daughter (having no daugh-
ters); and having at least one child who lives within 10
miles of the parent (not having such a child). The last vari-
able is especially important because it controls for the
effects of any prior residential mobility that resulted in
greater proximity to children.
In the equation testing the effects of an individual child's
characterisitics on his or her likelihood of being chosen by
a parent, the following variables are included as predictors
(reference groups in parentheses): age in years, being a
daughter (son), being married (unmarried), having income
above $30,000 (under $30,000), owning a home (renting),
having a child (no children), being better-off financially
than the parent (not being better-off financially than par-
ent), living within 10 miles of the parent (living 10 miles or
farther), and being a stepchild (being a biological or
adopted child).
Statistical method.--Because the three dependent vari-
ables were represented as binary outcomes, we used logis-
tic and probit regression models in each of the three stages
of the analysis. First, we estimated a logistic regression
equation to predict the expectation of moving. Next, we es-
timated a second logistic regression equation to predict
whether those parents who expected to move also expected
to move closer to a child. In this equation we adjusted for
possible sources of sample selection bias by including an
instrumental variable (A.) calculated as the predicted proba-
bility (from the first equation) that respondents did not ex-
pect to move (Berk, 1983; Heckman, 1979). This correction
is useful in analyses where the sample selection criterion
restricts the distribution of the dependent variable within
the contingent sample. Although it is difficult to identify a
specific mechanism by which the selection of "potential
movers" might produce such a restriction in our second
equation, we nevertheless used the instrumental variable
approach as a precaution against the possibility of selection
bias. In addition, normalized sample weights were applied
in the first two stages of the analysis so that the parameter
estimates were based on a sample that reflected a nationally
representative profile.
Finally, in the third stage of the analysis we examined
how the characteristics of children affect their likelihood of
being chosen by parents who already expect to move closer
to children. Because the outcome for each child was binary
(chosen or not) and the sampling units (children) were hier-
archically nested within parents, we employed random ef-
fects probit and logit estimation procedures. We used ran-
dom effects modeling in several ways. First, we performed
a random effects probit analysis based on all available in-
tergenerational dyads. This application provides a straight-
forward statistical test of whether there is significant with-
in-parent residual variation in the dependent variable
(measured as p, the proportion of the total error variance
that occurs within parental contexts). If p is not statistically
significant, then the random effects specification does not
hold, signifying that there are no unobserved family effects
and that the results are comparable to those obtained in or-
dinary probit analysis.
Next, we used hierarchical linear modeling with random
effects to identify within-parent variations in choice of chil-
dren based on their gender and the sources of those varia-
tions between parents. In this method, choice is treated as a
parent-specific decision that weighs between competing al-
ternatives (son vs daughter), and variations in such choices
are examined as a function of parental characteristics. Thus,
in this part of the analysis we included only those parents
who had at least one child of each gender. Specifically, ran-
dom effects modeling with a logit link function is used to
estimate coefficients at both the within-parent level of anal-
ysis (1) and the between-parent level of analysis (2). The
equation at Level 1 has the following form in the simple bi-

ing that the child is a daughter (Bryk & Raudenbush,
1992):

ent;),
bij is the predicted value of the marginal change in y.j
when Xij = 1 (daughters of parent j), and
ry is the error term for yy.
At Level 2, the equations have the following form, where

RESULTS
Expectation to move.--In the first stage of the analysis
we examined whether older parents expected (with 20% or
greater certainty) to move in the next 5 years. The logistic
regression equation shown in Table 2 reveals that housing
and neighborhood characteristics play a role in the expecta-
tion to move in the next 5 years. Those parents who do not
own homes, those who are relatively short-term residents in
their current housing, those who perceive their neighbor-
hoods as less safe, and those who consider the physical
conditions of their homes to be poorer are more likely to
expect to move. In addition, several sociodemographic
characteristics are associated with the expectation to move:
being White non-Hispanic (compared to Blacks), living
alone, having no children living closer than 10 miles, hav-
ing more education, and having a higher income are associ-
ated with having greater expectations to move. Also, having
better health--self-rated, cognitive, and functional
(IADL)--is associated with greater expectations of residen-
tial mobility.
Predictors of mobility can be classified into three under-

lying conceptual categories: (1) perceived inadequacy of
current housing/community, (2) enabling resources (health
and income), and (3) factors associated with weak attach-
ment to current housing/community (living alone, having
no children living nearby, short-term residency, renting).
That African Americans are less likely to expect to move
than are White non-Hispanics may result from greater inte-
gration of the former with kin and community institutions
or, alternatively, from racially segregated housing markets
that limit their access to housing alternatives.
Expectation of moving closer to children.--Next, we ex-
amine the factors that predict whether older parents who
expected to move in the next 5 years also expected to move
closer to or in with their children. This analysis is based on
1,240 parents who expected to move. We focused both on
parental characteristics and aggregate offspring characteris-
tics, including the availability of at least one daughter, the
availability of at least one child who is better-off financially
than the parent, and the availability of at least one child
who lives less than 10 miles from the parent.
The first logistic regression equation in Table 3 shows the
main effects on expectations of moving closer to or in with
a child. This equation reveals that age is a significant pre-
dictor. Older parents are more likely than younger parents to
expect that their moves will bring them geographically
closer to a child. Parents more advanced in age may per-
ceive their relatively short life expectancies as motivation to
become closer to their adult children. As we anticipated,
mothers were more likely than fathers to expect that their
moves would result in greater proximity to a child, a clear
affirmation that mothers maintain closer relationships with
their children throughout the life course. Thus, while moth-
ers and fathers were equally likely to expect to move (for
any reason), among those who did expect to move, mothers
preferred the communities or households of their adult chil-
dren as destinations for their intended mobility. Neither so-

cioeconomic nor health characteristics of parents were asso-
ciated with their expectations of moving closer to children.
Turning to aggregate characteristics of children, we
found that the number of children was positively associated
with expectations for greater proximity, signifying that hav-
ing more children increases the likelihood that there will be
at least one suitable child toward whom parents may expect
to move closer. Also, parents who had at least one child
who they perceived as having a stronger economic situation
than they did had greater expectations of moving closer to a
child than did parents without such a child. It is interesting
that parents who had at least one daughter were no more
likely to expect to move closer to a child than were parents
without a daughter. The absence of a gender effect for chil-
dren is quite surprising given the literature about the active
role played by daughters in the support systems of older
parents. However, the possibility remains that child-gender
effects are masked by parents whose choices are con-
strained by having only one child or same-sex children.
Next, we tested the proposition that the effect of parental
health problems on the expectation of moving closer to chil-
dren is magnified by living alone. In the second equation of
Table 3, we tested interaction terms between living arrange-
ments and each of IADL, self-rated health, and cognitive
impairment. Of the three health interactions, only self-rated
health significantly interacted with living arrangements,
such that poorer self-ratings of health were more strongly
associated with expectations of moving closer to children
among parents who lived alone than among those who lived
with others. A reasonable interpretation of this interaction is
that living alone heightens the vulnerability experienced by
parents with poorer subjective health, thereby elevating their
perceived need to be closer to their children.
Choice of child to move toward.--In the last stage of our
analysis, we examined whether parents chose to move
closer to children with particular characteristics. This model
required that we consider a data structure consisting of all
children of parents who expected to move closer to a child.
We present in Table 4 the characteristics of 2,118 such adult
children. More than half of these children (51%) are daugh-
ters, almost three quarters (71%) are between 40 and 59
years of age, three quarters (74%) are married, and about
8% are stepchildren. Slightly more than three quarters
(77%) own their homes, 82% are employed for pay, and
58% are rated as better-off financially than their parents.
The random effects logistic regression equation in Table
5 shows the effects of a child's characteristics on whether
that child is chosen by his or her parent as a target of return
migration. Gender of the child is a significant predictor, as
parents are more likely to choose daughters than sons. This
finding corresponds to known gender differences in the
strength of intergenerational relations.
Children who own their homes are also more likely to be
chosen as target children. Because homeowners' residences
are more stable than are those of renters, older parents may
feel more comfortable moving toward a child who has
greater potential for long-term residency. In addition, the
greater availability of space in a private home would be at-
tractive to parents who intend to move in with that child.
Older parents are also more inclined to move toward chil-
dren who live within 10 miles of them. Local children are
likely those with whom the parent already interacts most
frequently and with whom the most intimacy is shared. In
addition, a move within a radius of 10 miles is less disrup-
tive than a longer move, as it enables parents to maintain
existing social networks and familiar community surround-

targets of return migration.
Finally, we note that p, the test of the random effects as-
sumption, is not statistically significant. This means that
most of the variation in choosing which child will be the
destination of convergent mobility occurs between parents;
there is relatively little within-paient discrimination among
children.
Choosing sons versus daughters.--In this section we
focus on gender as a key variable that structures which chil-
dren older parents prefer to move toward. Indeed, quite
a large empirical literature documents the unique role
that daughters play as primary caregivers to older parents
and the strong cohesion between mothers and daughters
throughout the life course (Mancini & Blieszner, 1989;
Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Spitze & Logan, 1990; Walker &
Pratt, 1991). Because we are concerned with estimating a
model based on each parent's ability to choose among sons
and daughters, we limited this part of the analysis to a
subsample of 419 parents with at least one son and one

daughter, who taken together had a total of 1645 surviving
children. Further, we are interested in how parental charac-
teristics, such as gender, influence the strength of child gen-
der preferences. In order to describe such cross-level ef-
fects, we employed hierarchical linear modeling (HLM)
with random effects to formally test whether, and under
what conditions, parents choose daughters over sons as
targets of return migration. In this approach parents are
considered contexts within which children are embedded.
Specifically, we used HLM to estimate (1) whether there
are within-parent preferences for daughters, and (2) how
between-parent differences in gender, health, and living ar-
rangements influence these preferences.
We used the logistic regression capabilities of HLM to
estimate parameters at two levels. At the first level, esti-
mated intercepts and slopes predict for each parent the log
odds of choosing to move closer to a daughter compared to
a son (tests of whether these parameters randomly vary are
also provided). These parent-specific intercepts and slopes
serve as dependent variables at the second level (or fixed
portion) of analysis where the variation in each is predicted
by parental characteristics.
The HLM equations are presented in Table 6. In this ap-
plication of HLM, it should be noted that the "intercept-
only" specification of the fixed equations predicts the aver-
age log odds of choosing a son (in the random-intercept
model) and the difference in the log odds of choosing a
daughter over choosing a son (in the random-slope model).
When parental characteristics are added as predictors in the
fixed equations, the resulting coefficients estimate linear re-
lationships between those characteristics and the strength of
each random effect. The first set of equations in Table 6
shows the results from the intercept-only model for each
random variable. The first equation indicates that the log
odds of choosing a son is significantly greater than zero.
More importantly, the second equation reveals that parents
are significantly more likely to choose a daughter than a
son as the target of return migration. Further, tests of the
error term for each random effect, shown at the bottom of
Table 6, reveal that each effect has significant variation.
This suggests that there is sufficient heterogeneity in the
S160 SILVERSTEIN AND ANGELELLI
random effects to justify including parental characteristics
as predictors of their variation.
In the second set of equations in Table 6, we include
parental characteristics as predictors of each random effect.
Due to high correlations among the four measures of health
and functioning (IADL, ADL, self-rated health, and cogni-
tion) each measure was tested individually as a fixed effect
on the two random variables (not shown). Only IADL pro-
duced significant results, so we present the model using this
health variable in addition to gender and living arrange-
ments. Parents' IADL problems are negatively related to
the log odds of choosing sons and positively related to
choosing daughters over sons. These results signify that
parents in worse functional health are less likely than
healthier parents to choose sons, and their preference for
daughters over sons magnifies with worsening health.
The estimated coefficients for parents' gender are also
statistically significant. The equation for the random inter-
cept reveals that mothers are less likely than fathers to
choose sons. Gender of parent also predicts the random
slope; mothers are more likely than fathers to prefer daugh-
ters over sons. These results provide some evidence of
same-sex gender matching between parents and chosen
children, an interaction effect that was not observed in the
random effects probit equation (not shown). The fact that
same-sex pairing emerges only among parents who have
the opportunity to chose between children of both genders
suggests that parents without daughters may be inclined to
rely on their sons.
In order to make the interpretation of health and gender
effects more clear, we present predicted probabilities of
choosing sons and daughters based on estimated coeffi-
cients in the two random effects equations. Mean probabili-
ties (transformed from predicted log-odds) are presented for
mothers and fathers at minimum and maximum values of
functional health in Figure 1. Three trends are noteworthy
in this figure. First, daughters are generally preferred to
sons by both fathers and mothers. Second, sons are pre-
ferred more by fathers than by mothers, and daughters are
preferred more by mothers than by fathers. Third and most
interesting, Figure 1 shows that functionally impaired par-
ents are more likely than healthier parents to prefer daugh-
ters over sons not because daughters are chosen more often
by the more impaired, but because sons are chosen less
often by them. Sons may be viewed as less reliable or less
willing providers of services required by functionally im-
paired parents. In contrast, functionally impaired parents are
as likely as healthy parents to choose daughters, suggesting
that the preference for daughters is tied to factors other than
need. The net effect of these results is that the daughter-son
differential grows with increasing disability, almost tripling
in favor of daughters. Fathers and mothers with no disabil-
ity are, respectively, 1.2 and 2 times more likely to favor
daughters over sons, whereas those with the worst disability
are 3.5 and 6 times more likely to prefer daughters.
DISCUSSION
In this analysis we have investigated the factors that pre-
dispose older parents to move closer to or in with their
adult children. We have operationalized the process as a se-
ries of hierarchical choices related to mobility, mobility to-
ward children, and choice of children. As expected, greater
personal resources of health and wealth and poorer environ-
mental conditions in terms of neighborhood safety and
housing quality predispose older parents to move. Inade-
quate environmental conditions provide incentives for resi-
dential mobility, and better physical and financial capabili-
ties enable the respondent to meet the demands and costs of
mobility better.
None of the health variables influenced the expectation
of achieving greater geographic proximity with adult chil-
dren. However, living alone elevated the importance of poor
self-rated health in predisposing older parents to move
closer to or in with children. This finding suggests the im-
portance of considering living arrangements when assess-
ing the impact of physical impairment on mobility. That the
availability of a household partner buffers the need of vul-
nerable parents for proximate children suggests that adult
children function as a "second line" of support. This is con-
sistent with the notion that adult children serve as latent re-
sources in the support system of older parents, emerging
mostly when the need is greatest.
There is evidence as well that older parents desire greater
proximity with their children when at least one child is
more affluent than they are. This suggests that late-life re-
turn migration is guided more by self-interest than by altru-
ism toward less prosperous children. This principle stands
as a mirror image to that of the return migration of econom-

ically distressed children to the homes of their parents.
However, the effect of relative affluence does not emerge
when child-specific characteristics are considered. Among
those who express expectations of moving closer to chil-
dren, there is no discrimination based on differences in eco-
nomic well-being among children. In other words, the influ-
ence of the perceived economic well-being of adult
children appears to be an effect of the propensity of parents
to have more affluent children.
It is interesting that parents who have at least one child
who owns a home are no more likely to expect to move
closer to or in with children than are parents with no such
children; however, those parents who expect to move closer
to or in with children are influenced in their choice by
which children are homeowners. That parents discriminate
among their children based on their home ownership sug-
gests that this factor is an important characteristic in select-
ing the target child for return migration. The space, re-
sources, and residential stability associated with owning a
home may make the home-owning child a more attractive
choice for geographic convergence, especially when coresi-
dence is the intended goal.
Older parents, especially those in poor functional health,
are more likely to choose proximity to daughters over prox-
imity to sons. However, the perceived utility of geographic
convergence with daughters is not heightened when care-
giving needs of parents are most probable. Child gender
preferences under conditions of physical need may have
more to do with the avoidance of sons as less likely sources
of instrumental support. This reflects both the closer rela-
tionships that parents generally have with daughters and the
expectation that daughters may be more willing than sons
to provide many forms of support. Our results from the
HLM model suggest that impaired older parents are less in-
clined than healthier parents to view sons as desirable tar-
gets for return migration. Daughters are generally pre-
ferred, regardless of parental impairment.
Self-rated health in conjunction with living arrange-
ments--but not ADL, IADL, or cognitive health--predicts
older parents' expectations of moving closer to their children.
That self-appraisals are more important than more objective
aspects of health in predisposing parents to seek proximity to
children suggests a subjective basis for the predisposition of
older parents to return to the communities and households of
their children. However, it remains the task for future re-
searchers to determine whether subjective measures of health
predict subsequent mobility behavior as strongly as they do
mobility expectations. The finding that functional ability
(IADL) differentiates whether daughters or sons are chosen
suggests that objective health may emerge as a more impor-
tant factor in assistance-related mobility when the potential
targets of return migration are less abstract and their (per-
ceived) qualifications are more personified.
There are several limitations in our analyses that merit
discussion. First, our measure of expectations blurs the dis-
tinction between moving closer to a child and moving to
the household of a child. Although less is known about
attitudes toward intergenerational proximity, research on
coresidence has shown that older people do not necessarily
expect adult children to house their aging parents (Logan &
S162 SILVERSTEIN AND ANGELELLI
Spitze, 1995). In terms of actual geographic mobility, con-
vergence between older parents and their children that does
not result in coresidence is more common than convergence
that results in a shared household. One study found that the
proportion of older adults increasing proximity to a child
was three times that of those making a transition to coresi-
dence with a child (Silverstein, 1995), yet that research also
revealed that the same process of vulnerability (poor health
and widowhood) governed intergenerational convergence
as it did intergenerational coresidence. Nevertheless, be-
cause unmeasured factors related to norms, values, and per-
sonality may differentially influence the propensity of par-
ents to move closer to children and their propensity to
move in with children, we advise caution in the interpreta-
tion of the effects of variables likely to be correlated with
these unobserved factors.
This study has advanced our understanding of elderly re-
turn migration by explicitly examining the role of intergen-
erational processes in late-life mobility decisions. Notably,
half of the parents who expected to move also expected to
move closer to or in with their children, suggesting their im-
portance in the migration considerations of older parents.
We stress that mobility models continue to focus on both
personal characteristics of the potential migrant, as well as
the constraints and opportunities offered by members of the
greater social environment--especially those of children
when caregiving to the parent is at stake. For example, by
considering characteristics of adult children we have pro-
vided a nuanced perspective on the importance of proximity
to daughters over sons. Disabled parents are disinclined to
seek proximity to sons, but prefer proximity to daughters at
the same higher rates as healthier parents. Our results have
relevance, as well, to the influence of sociohistorical change
on intergenerational relations in aging families of the future.
One implication of our finding regarding stepchildren is re-
lated to the proliferation of blended families starting with
the baby boomers: As a result of divorce and remarriage,
this cohort may reach old age with more stepchildren and
fewer opportunities to engage in return migration.
Overall, our results suggest that adult children are impor-
tant--but contingent--resources for older parents. Adult
children are perceived as potential sources of support when
their parents live alone and rate their health as poor, a
model of intergenerational relations that is consistent with
the concept of the "latent kin matrix" (Riley, 1983). How-
ever, it is not possible to determine from these data if the
children who are chosen are themselves in favor of geo-
graphic convergence with their parents. Whether parents'
expectations for greater proximity are mirrored by their
children is undoubtedly related to the validity of the as-
sumptions on which their expectations are based. In addi-
tion, children's characteristics, especially those related to
nonnormative events (e.g., unemployment and divorce),
may be more important factors in child-initiated conver-
gence with parents. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that
adult children are important pull factors in the return migra-
tion decisions of older parents, implying that parents' antic-
ipated mobility is constrained to some degree by the type of
children they have. Future research examining how expec-
tations for mobility match with actual mobility and how ex-
pected target children match with actual target children will
shed light on the process linking subjective and objective
dimensions of solidarity between generations in the older
family.
