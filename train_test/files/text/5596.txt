Beyond Occupational
Differences: The
Importance of Cross-
cutting Demographics
and Dyadic Toolkits for
Collaboration in a U.S.
Hospital
Julia DiBenigno1 and Katherine C. Kellogg1
Abstract
We use data from a 12-month ethnographic study of two medical-surgical units
in a U.S. hospital to examine how members from different occupations can col-
laborate with one another in their daily work despite differences in status,
shared meanings, and expertise across occupational groups, which previous
work has shown to create difficulties. In our study, nurses and patient care
technicians (PCTs) on both hospital units faced these same occupational differ-
ences, served the same patient population, worked under the same manage-
ment and organizational structure, and had the same pressures, goals, and
organizational collaboration tools available to them. But nurses and PCTs on
one unit successfully collaborated while those on the other did not. We demon-
strate that a social structure characterized by cross-cutting demographics
between occupational groups--in which occupational membership is uncorre-
lated with demographic group membership--can loosen attachment to the
occupational identity and status order. This allows members of cross-
occupational dyads, in our case nurses and PCTs, to draw on other shared
social identities, such as shared race, age, or immigration status, in their inter-
actions. Drawing on a shared social identity at the dyad level provided mem-
bers with a ``dyadic toolkit'' of alternative, non-occupational expertise, shared
meanings, status rules, and emotional scripts that facilitated collaboration
across occupational differences and improved patient care.

Scholars of work and occupations have demonstrated that because different
occupations have different status, shared meanings, and expertise, it is difficult
for people to collaborate with one another across occupational boundaries
(Barley and Tolbert, 1991; Carlile 2004; Faraj and Xiao, 2006; O'Mahony and
Bechky, 2008). Difficulties from status differences can occur because an occupa-
tional group's prestige, authority, and autonomy result from occupation members
hiving off lower-status dirty work to subordinate occupation members and pro-
tecting occupational boundaries rather than collaborating with members of differ-
ent occupations (e.g., Abbott, 1988; Bechky, 2003a; Anteby, 2010; Ranganathan,
2013). Difficulties over meanings can occur because occupation-specific identities
and beliefs often make it hard for members of different occupations to under-
stand and appreciate each other's actions (Perlow and Weeks, 2002; Bechky,
2003b; Bailyn, 2006; Anteby, 2008). And difficulties around expertise can occur
because incompatible codes, routines, or protocols often make it challenging for
members of an occupation to share knowledge with non-members (Barley, 1986;
Carlile, 2002; Bailey, Leonardi, and Chong, 2010; Huising, 2014).
But scholars have also found that, despite these difficulties, when organiza-
tions provide certain tools to foster collaboration, cross-occupational collabora-
tion can be successful (see Okhuysen and Bechky, 2009, for a review). Rules
and routines can improve collaboration by bringing interdependent groups and
individuals together and specifying responsibility for tasks (e.g., Feldman, 2000;
Heimer, 2001; Feldman and Pentland, 2003). Boundary objects--objects used
by multiple occupational groups to coordinate their work--can support the
translation of meanings and the negotiation of status across occupational
boundaries (e.g., Star and Griesemer, 1989; Bechky, 2003b; Carlile, 2004;
Levina and Vaast, 2005). Also, common spaces can help promote communica-
tion and camaraderie among team members (e.g., Bechky, 2003b; Kellogg,
Orlikowski, and Yates, 2006). What they have not explained well, however, is
why such tools are not always effective in fostering cross-occupational colla-
boration. In this paper, we demonstrate that the answer may lie in demo-
graphic differences, which are important determinants of intergroup relations.
Despite the long history of work on the impact of demography in single
occupations in the sociology of work and occupations literature (e.g., Blair-Loy,
2001; Vallas, 2003; Turco, 2010; Cech et al., 2011), to our knowledge no stud-
ies have investigated the impact of demography on collaboration between
members of different occupational groups. Cross-occupational collaboration
scholars typically do not report or theorize about demographic information,
even though demography may have shaped the collaboration (or lack of it) that
they observed. For example, we are never told the demographic characteristics
of occupational groups in the cross-occupational collaboration between Barley's
(1986) radiologists and technicians or among Faraj and Xiao's (2006) trauma
team members. And though Kellogg, Orlikowski, and Yates (2006) and Bechky
(2003a) referred to the demographic differences among members of the differ-
ent occupations they studied, they did not investigate the implications of these
demographic differences for cross-occupational collaboration.
Scholars of demography and intergroup relations have found that it is not
always the overall diversity of a social system that explains how different groups
interact with one another but, rather, the extent to which the social structure is
characterized by ``cross-cutting'' demographics (e.g., Blau and Schwartz, 1984;
Lau and Murnighan, 1998). In social structures with cross-cutting demographics,
376 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
positional characteristics, such as occupation, and nominal characteristics, such
as race, are uncorrelated so that people who share a high-status characteristic
on one dimension do not also always share high-status characteristics on other
dimensions (e.g., race, age, and immigration status).
Cross-cutting demographics promote three kinds of intergroup dynamics.
First, members with traditionally devalued social identities are relatively equally
distributed among members in higher-status and lower-status positions. This
leads members to view traditionally devalued identities more positively and to
use them to build relationships. For example, Ely (1994, 1995) demonstrated
that in sex-integrated firms, the proportional representation of low-status group
members (women) in senior positions can signal to low-status group members
at lower levels that positions of power are attainable by members of their
group. This greater integration at senior levels creates conditions for more posi-
tive identification experiences and more constructive relationships between
junior and senior members of traditionally devalued groups.
Second, according to Blau and Schwartz (1984: 83­84), cross-cutting demo-
graphics put ``individuals at the intersection of a web of group affiliations that exert
diverse and often counteracting pressures, weakening the hold any one group has
on its members, widening the options of individuals, and increasing their free-
dom.'' Scholars have shown that individuals who identify with a social group adopt
its norms and values and act according to the group's prescriptions (Turner, 1987;
Hogg and Terry, 2000). In settings with cross-cutting demographics, members are
influenced not only by ties to one group (e.g., occupation), but also by ties to other
groups with whom they identify (e.g., Haitians). This reduces the control that any
single group has on members' thoughts, actions, and loyalties.
Third, cross-cutting demographics facilitate intergroup liking and trust via the
direct and indirect effects of homophilous cross-group interactions. Because
group members tend to associate informally with colleagues who share salient
demographic characteristics (e.g., McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook, 2001),
when many members from one group have some demographic similarity with
members of the other group, there is a higher degree of intergroup contact
that, under particular conditions such as sharing a superordinate goal and the
support of authorities (e.g., Allport, 1954), can lead to liking and comfort. The
direct effect of this is liking and attraction between members of the two groups
who share demographic characteristics (e.g., Byrne, 1971; Tsui and O'Reilly,
1989; Reagans, 2005). The indirect effect is increased feelings of comfort and
liking, even between members of the two groups who do not share at least
one demographic characteristic, because of members' enhanced knowledge
about the other group, reduced anxiety about intergroup contact, and increased
empathy and ability to take the perspective of the other group (e.g., Pettigrew
and Tropp, 2006; Pettigrew et al., 2011).
We find that by promoting these three dynamics, cross-cutting demo-
graphics can loosen attachment to identity and status distinctions, readying the
way for actors from different groups to interact with one another. Drawing on a
wide array of social identities (e.g., immigrant, young person), rather than on
one dominant identity such as occupation, can provide cross-occupational
dyads with an expanded ``cultural toolkit'' (Swidler, 1986) of shared resources
to guide their interactions. While cultural theorists demonstrate that people
draw on the cultural tools afforded by their social identities to shape their
actions (Swidler, 1986), symbolic interactionists remind us that our actions also
DiBenigno and Kellogg 377
depend on the specific interaction partners with whom we deal. People take
the point of view of the other person involved in the interaction and modify what
they are doing to fit in more or less easily with what their interaction partner is
likely to do (Goffman, 1959; Blumer, 1969; Van Maanen, 2010). Thus members
of different occupations have access not only to the cultural toolkits provided by
their occupational identities and the organizational toolkits provided by top man-
agers, but also to what we call ``dyadic toolkits'' provided by the non-
occupational social identities they share at the dyad level (e.g., shared race, age,
immigration status, motherhood, etc.). By drawing on these shared social identi-
ties, cross-occupational dyads gain access to an alternative, non-occupational
toolkit of expertise, shared meanings, status rules, and emotional scripts they
can use to work successfully with one another across occupational differences.
METHODS
We conducted a 12-month ethnographic study of collaboration between nurses
and patient-care technicians (PCTs) on two different units at Huron Hospital (all
names are pseudonyms). Nurses and PCTs on both units faced similar chal-
lenges in collaboration due to differences in occupational status, meanings, and
expertise and had similar organizational tools available to them.
The first author interviewed and observed nurses and PCTs for two- to
three-and-a-half-hour sessions. This author dressed in scrubs and accompanied
nurses and PCTs while they went about their work and also conducted ``real-
time'' interviews (Barley and Kunda, 2001) during moments of privacy in supply
rooms, medication rooms, the kitchenette, and break room. During the first
month of observation, we noticed interesting dynamics occurring on the night
shift, which led us to focus observations on this shift; cross-occupational colla-
boration is particularly valuable on the night shift because patients have no visi-
tors to monitor them. The first author conducted 42 observations of nurses and
PCTs working on two medical-surgical units (Units A and B) during the night
shift. The observations were conducted across all days of the week and all
times of the night. In addition, the first author conducted 42 background inter-
views with nurses and PCTs. These interviews averaged between 30 and 45
minutes and were conducted at various times during the observational session,
typically when the nurse or PCT had a period of downtime.
The units were well matched on factors shown to affect cross-occupational
collaboration (see Okhuysen and Bechky, 2009, for a review). Because they
were part of the same hospital, they shared the same management and organi-
zational structure, were subject to the same pressures and goals, and had the
same procedures, protocols, and collaboration tools, as shown in table 1. The
units also served the same patient populations--medical-surgical patients--and
both units ran at full capacity. Unit A had fewer patient beds than Unit B (24 vs.
36 beds), but the units were staffed according to hospital-wide staffing guide-
lines so that patient-to-staff ratios were the same on each unit.
We used interviews to triangulate our observations with occupation mem-
bers' own interpretations of the cross-occupational interactions in which they
had recently participated to reduce possible researcher bias in interpreting
nurse­PCT interactions. Interviews that did not focus on members' own inter-
pretations of recent nurse­PCT interactions centered on four main themes:
background and career histories and goals, including what collaboration had
378 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
been like when the member first joined the unit; the beliefs of each occupa-
tional group about what constitutes good patient care; how members decided
who performed each task, particularly when one member of the nurse­PCT
dyad was busy; and how their unit compared with other units they had
``floated'' on (worked on temporarily when another unit was short-staffed). The
first author took extensive notes during observations and interviews, which
were typed up within 24 hours.
Nurse and PCT pairings were made in the same way on both units each eve-
ning by the resource nurse--a shared, rotating position held by a different nurse
each night on each unit. The assignment of nurses and PCTs was to patients,
however, and not to specific nurse­PCT dyads, as every effort was made to
ensure that nurses and PCTs were assigned to patients to whom they had been
assigned on previous nights to facilitate continuity of care. Because patients
stayed on the unit an average of 36 hours, in this assignment system, all nurses
worked with all PCTs regularly; there were no consistent nurse­PCT dyads.
The first author observed 137 unique nurse­PCT dyads working together: 56
on Unit A and 81 on Unit B. We used a sampling spreadsheet to select for
observation of an equal number of nurses and PCTs on each unit for an equal
number of days of the week, weekdays vs. weekends, and times of the night,
11 P.M.­2 A.M., 2 A.M.­5 A.M., and 4 A.M.­7 A.M. We did not know ahead of time
which nurses and PCTs would be working, except for the nurses and PCTs
who had steady schedules. When the first author arrived, the resource nurse
selected the nurse or PCT to be observed, typically by asking the closest nurse
or PCT if she was willing to be ``shadowed.'' Nurses and PCTs at Huron were
used to being followed around by trainees, and they were usually quite willing
to be shadowed. There were only a handful of times when the first author did
not shadow the randomly selected nurse or PCT, and this occurred when the
nurse or PCT selected had already been observed recently. This sampling led
us to observe 74 of the 137 dyads in depth--31 on Unit A and 43 on Unit B--
by which we mean that we shadowed one or both parties of the dyad one on
one while they were working together and collected enough data to reach
saturation on the dyad's typical social and work interactions. All staff on both
units were female except for three male nurses on Unit A, and one on Unit B.

The demographic characteristics of the dyads sampled on each unit were rep-
resentative of the demographic makeup of that unit.
Our data collection proceeded in three phases. In the first two months, we
focused on understanding the PCT and nursing occupations and the nature of
the cross-occupational collaboration of nurses and PCTs at Huron. Collaboration
between nurses and PCTs is imperative for delivering high-quality patient care
because many tasks require more than one person to complete. For example,
bedridden patients need to be repositioned at least every two to four hours, a
task that requires more than one person. In addition, the high workload on
medical-surgical units and the unpredictability of patients' demands make it dif-
ficult for any one nurse or PCT to provide good care to all assigned patients
independently. Because nurses or PCTs can easily get stuck in patients' rooms
responding to unanticipated problems, they need to cover one another's
assigned patients when this happens. In addition, PCTs have higher patient
loads than nurses (1 PCT to 12 patients vs. 1 nurse to 6 patients), and when
PCTs are busy, nurses are expected to pitch in and help with PCTs' tasks.
Next, we took a month to code our data for preliminary themes and pat-
terns. We analyzed all instances of nurse­PCT collaboration. We saw clear dif-
ferences in the collaboration practices on the two units studied, with
successful cross-occupational collaboration occurring among many nurse­PCT
dyads on Unit A and not on Unit B. We re-read in detail the literature on cross-
occupational collaboration, which highlighted that the failed collaboration on
Unit B was expected because of occupational differences in expertise, shared
meanings, and status, while the successful collaboration on Unit A was
unusual.
We used the second phase of data collection (five months) to understand
how and when successful versus unsuccessful cross-occupational collaboration
occurred on the two units. In the final phase of data collection (four months),
we more closely followed the work and social interactions of nurse­PCT dyads
on Unit A to understand why most dyads collaborated well. In this phase, we
also used in-situ interview questions to test our emerging understanding of
how successful cross-occupational collaboration was occurring.
When we determined that high levels of collaboration were occurring on
Unit A but not Unit B, we contrasted the two cases to identify practices associ-
ated with successful cross-occupational collaboration. Our inductive analysis
(Glaser and Strauss, 1967) consisted of multiple readings of field notes and
interview notes, writing analytical memos, and tracking patterned activities and
issues related to collaboration in ATLAS/ti, a qualitative data analysis program.
To understand why many dyads on Unit A successfully collaborated while
those on Unit B did not, we analyzed each nurse­PCT dyad's social and work
interactions. Online Appendix A (http://asq.sagepub.com/supplemental) pro-
vides descriptions of the characteristics of the dyads we studied on both units,
their occupational and social identities, and whether they made use of shared
social identities in their work interactions.
CROSS-OCCUPATIONAL COLLABORATION
Our analysis showed that Unit A was characterized by cross-cutting demo-
graphics at the unit level that loosened attachment to occupational identity and
status distinctions and created space for nurse­PCT dyads to connect around a
380 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
shared social identity. Even though most dyads on Unit A differed on at least
one visible demographic characteristic, most identified at least one shared iden-
tity that provided them with a non-occupational toolkit at the dyad level that
they used to overcome occupational differences and collaborate to provide
patient care. In contrast, on Unit B, collaboration failed. What makes the differ-
ence in collaboration on the two units interesting is that they were so similar in
terms of barriers previously shown to make cross-occupational collaboration
difficult. On both units, nurses and PCTs needed to overcome occupational dif-
ferences in status, emotional scripts, shared meanings, and expertise in order
to successfully collaborate with one another, as shown in table 2.
Cross-occupational Differences in Status
We observed that because occupational members maintain their status, in part,
through the tasks they do in everyday work and through the communication
rules they use with one another (see Sauder, 2005, for a review), asking nurses
to help with ``PCT work'' was problematic on both units. Nurses primarily per-
formed higher-status cerebral work associated with patient management, while
PCTs spent most of their shifts engaged in low-status, physically taxing work
that put them in close contact with patients with contagious infections and dis-
eases. But delivering responsive care sometimes required nurses to perform
``PCT tasks,'' such as helping patients with toileting needs, changing linens,
and bathing, feeding, and repositioning patients, which violated the nurses' jur-
isdiction. This was problematic because nurses had hived off hands-on care
work to PCTs years earlier in response to pressures for cost-cutting (Weiss and
Lonnquist, 2000; Weinberg, 2003). This hiving off allowed nurses to focus on
more abstract issues associated with patient management, such as conducting
documentation activities and coordinating care activities among various hospital

workers. In part because of this more abstract work, the nursing occupation is
considered more prestigious than the PCT occupation; in the U.S., for example,
in 2012 the median annual nursing salary was $65,470 compared with $24,400
for PCTs (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014a, 2014b), and while the majority of
nurses had four-year college degrees, the majority of PCTs had only a high
school education and a six-week PCT training course. Some nurses in our study
felt that doing PCT work was not a good use of their time given their more
advanced skill sets and education.
Nurses and PCTs also had different occupational rules for communication
that reflected and maintained status differences between groups. We observed
nurses give direct commands to PCTs, speak more frequently when interacting
with PCTs, and often sit down during ``report''--a time each night when nurses
updated PCTs on their shared patients. The PCTs we observed frequently took
orders or gave orders only indirectly, for example, ``51 is requesting his nurse''
instead of ``go to 51.'' PCTs usually spoke less than nurses, stood up during
report, and were more attentive to nurses than nurses were to them.
Cross-occupational Differences in Emotion Rules
Nurses and PCTs on both units also faced challenges due to differences in
occupational feeling rules for expressing emotions with other staff. When
nurses were upset with PCTs, we saw nurses confront PCTs directly and often
publicly. We also observed nurses openly express negative emotions, including
stress (``Tonight is crazy. It's a full house!'') and frustration (``We're short on
staff `cause someone on [another unit] was sick so they took one of ours''), to
both fellow nurses and PCTs. In contrast, when PCTs were upset with a nurse,
we often observed them suppress these negative emotions and not confront
the nurse. In addition, PCTs typically responded to nurses' expressions of anxi-
ety by appearing calm, for example, when told they would have an increased
patient load due to short-staffing. We typically saw PCTs express negative
emotions privately only to other PCTs. These differences in occupational feeling
rules for expressing negative emotions between staff members often made it
difficult for nurses and PCTs to relate to one another effectively, particularly
when dealing with conflict or when mistakes were made.
Nurses and PCTs also differed in how they expressed positive emotions.
We frequently observed nurses publicly express positive emotions, such as
gratitude and pride, and share patient triumphs with other nurses but not with
PCTs. For example, we often saw nurses go out of their way to find and per-
sonally thank other nurses who had done something to help them out without
being asked during the shift, such as changing another nurse's patient's IV bag.
But nurses did not typically demonstrate the same level of gratitude toward
PCTs when PCTs helped out unasked. PCTs were less publicly expressive than
nurses about positive emotions, and when they did express those emotions,
such as feeling proud because of compliments patients had given them, they
typically oriented them toward other PCTs rather than toward nurses. Perhaps
because positive emotions such as gratitude and pride were most often
directed toward members of one's own occupational group, nurses and PCTs
had no available occupational scripts for showing appreciation to or sharing
their triumphs with one another.
382 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
Cross-occupational Differences in Meanings
Cross-occupational collaboration was also difficult because nurses and PCTs
drew on occupation-specific beliefs, values, and demeanors that often led them
to judge the actions of members of the other group as unnecessary or even
inappropriate. Nurses and PCTs on both units had different occupational beliefs
and values. Nurses reported that the best nurses were the ones who easily
engaged in the critical thinking needed to analyze lab results and who demon-
strated accuracy and precision when documenting, filling, and administering
medications. Common sayings by nurses on both units included ``Always dou-
ble check your books''; ``Cross your T's and dot your I's''; and ``Being OCD
[obsessive compulsive] is a good thing.'' In contrast, PCTs valued providing
responsive, hands-on care to patients by physically helping them, and they con-
sidered the best PCTs to be those who won the affection of patients and
treated patients with dignity and respect, especially when patients were in
embarrassing situations: ``You have to do your work with heart, with love'';
``Give the kind of care you'd want your mother to receive''; ``It's a heartfelt
thing''; and ``You know when it's genuine and they know too--the patients can
tell.'' Differences in occupational values and beliefs often led nurses and PCTs
at Huron each to perceive the other to be providing inappropriate care; nurses
often referred to PCTs as ``overly familiar'' with patients, while PCTs often
referred to nurses as ``cold.''
Nurses and PCTs on both units also displayed different occupational demea-
nors in their interactions with patients. Nurses often acted assertively with
patients and used humor to speed up or avoid potentially emotionally laden
interactions for which nurses felt they did not have time given their many time-
sensitive responsibilities (e.g., all patients had to have their medications admi-
nistered within the same two-hour window). PCTs, in contrast, were reserved
and quiet when interacting with nurses or in the presence of a physician, and
they often gave patients physical support and affection by holding their hand,
stroking their hair, or touching them gently on the hand or arm when talking to
them. These differences in occupational demeanor sometimes made it difficult
for nurses and PCTs to understand and appreciate each other's actions. Nurses
on both units sometimes described PCTs as getting ``walked all over'' by
patients and were often impatient when PCTs were unavailable to help
because they were spending ``excessive'' time in patients' rooms; PCTs on
both units often described nurses as being ``too short'' with patients.
Cross-occupational Differences in Expertise
Finally, nurses and PCTs at Huron faced challenges due to differences in occu-
pational expertise. Nurses and PCTs on both units drew on occupation-specific
bodies of knowledge, sources of information, and patient-care skills, and this
often made it difficult for them to share their expertise with one another. We
often saw nurses draw on the deep clinical knowledge of anatomy, medica-
tions, and medical tests and procedures they had gained from their formal edu-
cation. In contrast, the PCTs we observed usually diagnosed patients'
problems using informal, concrete rules-of-thumb grounded in everyday prac-
tice, such as comparing a patient's current state to the same patient's state on
prior shifts on which these PCTs had worked. Because nurses privileged
DiBenigno and Kellogg 383
abstract, formal knowledge of diseases, medications, and lab results in guiding
their decision making, they often considered PCTs' knowledge to be irrelevant.
PCTs often noted that nurses did not take seriously their concrete knowledge
of subtle changes in patients' states and patients' idiosyncratic needs.
Regarding occupational skills and information, we saw nurses use computer
skills and computerized information to track patients' detailed medical histories,
test results, current medications, and overall care plans. In contrast, we saw
PCTs rely primarily on sensory skills and information gained from directly inter-
acting with patients in the patients' rooms. Nurses and PCTs often appeared to
be unaware of the unique skills and information possessed by the other occu-
pational group. The routine of ``report'' was in place so that nurses would
update PCTs at the beginning of the shift to ensure that they had the basic care
information they needed to begin taking vital signs. But nurses frequently
ignored this routine, and PCTs often told us that waiting for nurses to give
them report at the beginning of the shift slowed them down.
Hospital Tools to Facilitate Cross-occupational Collaboration
The hospital provided several tools to facilitate collaboration between nurses
and PCTs despite occupational differences. First, rules and routines were in
place on both units that governed the order and timing at which certain patient
care tasks needed to occur. Report was one of those routines. In addition, vital
signs were expected to be taken on both units between 11 P.M. and 1 A.M.,
medications were expected to be given at midnight, vital signs of those on
heart monitors were expected to be done at 4 A.M., and documentation of
patient input and output was expected to be conducted by 6 A.M. These rou-
tines were designed so nurses and PCTs could understand when the other
group's workload was heavy so they could offer assistance during these times
in order to meet ongoing deadlines.
Second, boundary objects existed to facilitate collaboration between nurses
and PCTs. Patient charts, templates assigning patients to nurses and PCTs,
electronic patient records, call-light phone technology, pagers and the paging
system, and whiteboards in patients' rooms were available on both units. Such
boundary objects were designed so nurses and PCTs could be aware of when
the other required help. The hospital also did not require nurses and PCTs to
dress differently, which minimized status differences.
Finally, common spaces existed for collaboration. On both units, there was a
reception desk containing the call-light phone monitor and one computer termi-
nal followed by rows of computer terminals with enough seating for all nurses
and PCTs. Both units also contained similar enclosed spaces for use by both
nurses and PCTs, including a locker room and break room, small kitchenette,
two medication rooms, and a main supply room. These common spaces
allowed for informal information sharing between nurses and PCTs.
Cross-occupational Collaboration Outcomes
Despite similar barriers to and tools for cross-occupational collaboration on
units A and B, collaboration largely succeeded on Unit A and failed on Unit B.
These differences in cross-occupational collaboration had a real impact on
patient care. A vignette is helpful in describing what successful versus failed
384 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
collaboration looked like in practice. One night on Unit A, Mr. Smith, a patient,
lost control of his bladder and saturated his sheets with urine. Because Huron
required visitors to leave each day at 8 P.M., no family member or friend was
there to help him. When Jessica, the assigned nurse, came into his room a few
minutes later to assess his wounds, she began right away to clean Mr. Smith.
When Jessica realized that she could not do it on her own, she asked Anna, the
PCT, for help. Anna said yes and came in as soon as she was done assisting
another patient. Mr. Smith was cleaned within 10 minutes by Jessica and Anna.
Contrast this with a similar situation on Unit B with a different patient,
Mr. Johnson. He similarly lost control of his bladder. Jill, the nurse assigned to
Mr. Johnson, came into his room a few minutes later to deliver medications.
She cursed under her breath and said defiantly, ``I am not cleaning this up.
Someone will get to it later.'' Cara, the PCT assigned to Mr. Johnson, came in
soon after and realized that helping Mr. Johnson was a two-person job. She
asked Jill for help. Jill said yes but then ignored her. An hour later, another nurse
told Jill that the patient was calling again and requesting to be changed. Cara
was busy just then, and Jill refused to start without Cara. Mr. Johnson ended
up lying in his own urine for an hour and a half before he was finally cleaned by
Jill and Cara.
Incidents such as these occurred regularly on the respective units. On Unit
A, there were more instances in which nurses helped with PCT tasks when
PCTs were busy, fewer ignored patient calls, fewer ignored heart monitor
alarms, and fewer patient complaints than on Unit B, as shown in table 3. The
outcomes in table 3 were selected because they directly or indirectly resulted
from the quality of nurse­PCT collaboration. Totals were calculated using data
collected from all 42 observational sessions. Responding promptly to a
patient's call is defined as a nurse or PCT answering the nursing station call-
light phone and speaking to the calling patient to find out what he or she needs

within the first few minutes of it ringing vs. ignoring the call and letting it ring
for extended periods of time, until a PCT (or nurse) is free to answer it. Total
patient calls include some patients who called multiple times when their calls
were ignored. Promptly attending to telemetry (heart monitor) alarms is defined
as a nurse or PCT responding to the alarm within the first few minutes. On
Unit B, there were many sessions in which telemetry alarms sounded for
nearly the entire observational session.
Cross-cutting Demographics in a Unit's Social Structure
Our analysis suggests that the high degree of cross-cutting demographics within
the social structure of Unit A, but not Unit B, shaped the difference in cross-
occupational collaboration outcomes. On the Unit A night shift, nurses and PCTs
differed along occupational lines but were mixed in terms of the immediately
visible identities of race, age, and immigration status, which was visible because
of accented speech. On Unit B, as well as on most other hospital units at Huron
and other shift times on Unit A, the demographic composition of the nursing and
PCT groups was consolidated in terms of race, age, and immigration status,
meaning that occupational differences between nurses and PCTs coincided with
other demographic differences. As table 4 illustrates, most nurses on Unit B
were white, mid-20-year-olds who grew up in the U.S., while most PCTs on Unit
B were minorities, older (in their 40s to 50s), and non-U.S.-born.
It was not simply occupational group membership aligning (or not) with
demographic characteristics that shaped differences in the intergroup dynamics
on the two units; it was also, more importantly, the extent to which demo-
graphic characteristics were associated with status differences that loosened
attachment to the occupational identity and status order on Unit A and rein-
forced it on Unit B. On Unit A, the higher-status nursing group had many mem-
bers with traditionally devalued social identities in this context--non-white,
older, and non-U.S.-born--while the lower-status PCT group had many mem-
bers with traditionally valued social identities in this context--white, younger,
and U.S.-born.1 The mismatch in status between occupational identities and

1 In this context, members considered being younger (20s and 30s) more valuable than being older
(over 40), particularly on medical-surgical units like Units A and B where computer literacy and
speed, quick reaction time, and physical fitness and stamina--all traits associated with the young--
were prized among nurses and PCTs.

other readily apparent social identities loosened attachment to the occupational
identity and status order on Unit A.2 On Unit B, in contrast, most members
who had higher-status occupational characteristics also had higher-status
demographic characteristics--nurses were nearly all in their 20s and 30s,
white, and U.S.-born, while PCTs were nearly all older, non-white, and non-
U.S.-born--which reinforced the occupational identity and status order.
The cross-cutting demographics of Unit A promoted three kinds of inter-
group dynamics between nurses and PCTs that created space for nurse­PCT
dyads to draw on a shared, non-occupational social identity to guide their inter-
actions with one another: (1) the valuing of traditionally devalued identities and
the building of relationships around them because of the presence of members
in higher-status positions with traditionally devalued identities (e.g., black
nurses), (2) low occupational in-group pressure resulting from a high degree of
intersecting group affiliations that exerted diverse and often counteracting iden-
tity pressures on nurses and PCTs, and (3) feelings of comfort and liking even
between nurses and PCTs who did not share demographic characteristics
resulting from a high degree of homophilous cross-occupational contact.
Valuing of traditionally devalued identities. Ely (1994, 1995) has shown
that when traditionally devalued social identities are relatively equally distribu-
ted among the higher- and lower-status groups, they are often viewed posi-
tively. On Unit A, where the higher-status nursing group had many members
with traditionally devalued social identities, members fondly referred to their
shift as the ``United Nations,'' and nearly all noted that they viewed the diver-
sity in age, race, and immigration status in a positive light. For example, a
young, white, U.S.-born Unit A nurse related:
I like the diversity. We have older nurses and people from different nationalities and I
like it better. When I float to other floors, it's all white women in their 20s and 30s.
It's weird. We get patients here from all different countries so it helps that so many
of our nurses and PCTs can speak another language.
On Unit A, the positive view of traditionally devalued social identities allowed
nurses and PCTs to draw on these and other shared identities without fear of
status loss. For example, a nurse on Unit A explained how she tried to over-
come her traditionally devalued social identities when floating on other units
but did not need to do so on Unit A:
When I float, I will sometimes name drop that I went to [a good college near the hos-
pital that many nurses attended] so they [the nurses] don't think I'm off the boat [a
recent immigrant] `cause I'm black and have an accent. Here, I don't need to do stuff
like that, since like half of us [nurses] are black and have an accent.
2 The loosening attachment to the occupational identity and status order on Unit A did not lead to
contestation over the general prestige and status ranking of the nursing versus PCT occupation on
the unit. Members do not contest and protect the status order unless they believe that lower-status
members have the opportunity to move into the higher-status group (e.g., Bendersky and Hays,
2012; George, Chattopadhyay, and Zhang, 2012). Here, PCTs had no opportunity to move into the
nursing ranks without leaving Huron and going back to school for four years to train as nurses.
DiBenigno and Kellogg 387
In contrast, on Unit B, the immediately visible association between occupa-
tional position and race, age, and immigration status activated the use of com-
mon negative stereotypes about traditionally devalued social identities. We
often heard Unit B nurses use common stereotypes about non-whites, older
people, and members of certain immigrant groups to describe PCTs (e.g.,
``slow,''``lazy,''``incompetent,'' and ``can't be trusted''), even though we
observed the PCTs on Unit B to be just as industrious as those on Unit A. For
example, a young, white, U.S.-born nurse on Unit B related, ``You can't count
on them [PCTs]. Most are lazy and try to do the bare minimum so you really
can't trust them . . . they'll take forever to do something that you ask.'' And, in
contrast to the nurses on Unit A who valued staff who could speak another lan-
guage, the Unit B nurses had little patience for PCTs' accented speech. One
noted, ``Language is an issue here since some [PCTs] aren't fully versed in
English and don't feel comfortable. That always disturbs me because I think if
you get to a certain position and you can't speak English . . . I just don't get it.''
Despite such seemingly racist comments, our data suggest there was no dif-
ference in racial attitudes among nurses prior to joining their respective units.
We address this issue in Online Appendix B.
Occupational in-group pressure. Cross-cutting demographics on Unit A
also put nurses and PCTs at the intersection of many different group affiliations
that exerted diverse and counteracting pressures, increasing their freedom by
weakening the power any one particular group affiliation had over their
thoughts, actions, and loyalties. For example, nurses and PCTs on Unit A were
less beholden to the occupational dress norms typical of most other units and
other shift times on Unit A. While nurses and PCTs on Unit B dressed in a way
that distinguished them from one another, with most nurses wearing plain blue
or subdued monochromatic scrubs and most PCTs wearing bright, colorful,
matching patterned and cartooned scrubs, on Unit A they did not. On Unit A,
nurses and PCTs wore a mixture of dress styles, and individual nurses and
PCTs often mixed up their dress styles from night to night. In addition, on Unit
B, nurses and PCTs sat in separate locations in the nursing station, with nurses
forming a circle with their workstations in the center of the nursing station
while PCTs sat along the periphery. On Unit A, in contrast, nurses and PCTs
sat interspersed in the nursing station.
The conversational topics of the Unit A nursing group were also highly
accessible to people with diverse age, racial, national, and class backgrounds;
Unit A nurses talked about the weather, work schedules, cleaning, vacations,
and hospital or unit-related events. PCTs were included in these discussions as
respected members of the team, and gossip about other staff was rare. On
Unit A, the low occupational in-group pressure also allowed nurses and PCTs
to interact with one another without sanction in ways that conformed to the
norms of shared social identities, such as immigrant or mother, rather than just
to the norms of their occupational identities. As one first-generation Haitian
nurse in her 30s explained:
Different shifts have different dynamics. It's nice here that I have people like [PCT5A]
and [PCT10A] here [both of Haitian descent]. . . . And it's no big deal if I want to sit
388 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
with [PCT5A] and talk about the earthquake [that devastated Haiti] or anyone [PCT or
nurse] for that matter--no one's going to blink an eye.
On Unit B, socializing was highly segregated by occupational group. Here
the nurses primarily talked about topics that aligned with their age, racial,
national, and class backgrounds as young, white, Northeastern middle-class
women. Their conversations revolved around dating, marriage proposals, wed-
ding planning, pregnancy and getting pregnant, baby showers, vacation plans
to places like Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod, and music, movies, and televi-
sion shows featuring primarily all-white, American artists and casts. PCTs on
Unit B socialized only with other PCTs.
In addition, we noted in our field notes several situations on Unit B in which
nurses or PCTs attempted to act outside of the bounds of occupational norms
and were reproached by their occupational group members. For example, one
evening, Nurse23B on Unit B fielded a few calls for a busy PCT and was made
fun of by the other nurses for acting like a PCT: ``Nurse23B hangs up the call
light phone and Nurse14B calls out loudly, `So you're the new secretary now,
huh?' She and the other nurses nearby laugh and Nurse23B looks embarrassed
and makes a joke of it. Nurse23B does not pick up any more calls that night.''
During the course of the study, only one nurse moved between units.
Nurse16, who was young, white, and U.S.-born and had recently graduated
from a local nursing school near the hospital, worked on Unit A for a few
months before switching to Unit B. On Unit A, she collaborated well with most
of the PCTs she worked with. We observed her make the transition from Unit
A to Unit B. During her first week on Unit B, she wore colorful and festive
scrub outfits typical of those worn by both nurses and PCTs on Unit A but only
by PCTs on Unit B. During this week, we also observed her attempt to find
commonalities with the PCTs she worked with, talking with one of the younger
PCTs about a popular musical group. We saw her openly praise and thank one
of the PCTs in front of the other nurses. Unfortunately for Nurse16, her actions
were condemned by the other nurses on Unit B. We saw the other nurses on
Unit B gossip about her ``inappropriate'' behavior, and we saw them avoid help-
ing her in several situations even though they went out of their way to help
other nurses. When Nurse16 had to deal with a patient with an unexplained
high heart rate at the same time that one of her other patients was bleeding,
none of the Unit B nurses assisted her, even though this was their common
practice with other nurses. During this first week, she sat alone on the periph-
ery of the nursing station, and the other nurses did not include her in social
conversations.
Over the course of several shifts on Unit B, we saw Nurse16 distance her-
self socially from the PCTs. She also started conforming to the norms of her
Unit B occupational group and began exclusively wearing plain blue scrubs like
the other nurses. When we left the field, she was demonstrating occupation-
ally prescribed behavior and had gained acceptance from her fellow nurses on
Unit B.
Feelings of comfort and liking between groups. Finally, on Unit A, many
nurses and PCTs shared at least one demographic attribute with members in
the other occupational group, leading to higher levels of homophilous
DiBenigno and Kellogg 389
interaction and liking across groups. For example, 80 percent of observed
nurse­PCT dyads on Unit A shared at least one visible social identity in terms
of race (white, black/African-American, Hispanic, or Asian), age (within 10 years
in age), or immigration status (U.S.-born or non-U.S.-born), compared with only
19 percent on Unit B. And more than half of the observed dyads on Unit A (52
percent) shared at least two visible identities, while none of the observed
nurse­PCT dyads on Unit B shared two or more visible social identities.
Because nurses and PCTs on both units had a superordinate goal of provid-
ing patient care, and hospital authorities supported collaborative nurse­PCT
relations, this high degree of homophilous intergroup contact on Unit A had
both a direct, interpersonal effect and an indirect, intergroup effect on the
dynamics of Unit A. The direct, interpersonal effect was that, for members of
the nursing and PCT groups who shared at least one demographic characteris-
tic, positive affect and liking stemmed from having a meaningful social identity
in common. For example, Nurse7A and PCT12A were both middle-aged,
Hispanic immigrants who frequently communicated in Spanish with one
another and expressed interpersonal liking:
Nurse7A steps out into the hallway and PCT12A comes over. . . . Nurse7A says, ``His
vitals are done, okay? 62 is done, 64, 66, 68 also done, okay?'' PCT12A replies,
``Okay.'' They then start speaking in Spanish, and Nurse7A is beaming as she puts
her arm around PCT12A and hugs her.
The indirect effect was enhancing nurses' and PCTs' knowledge about the
other group, reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and increasing empathy
and perspective taking across groups. This, in turn, led to increased feelings of
comfort and liking even among members of the two groups who did not share
any demographic characteristics. For example, many nurses on Unit A were
empathetic to the working conditions of the PCTs with whom they worked,
which led to good relationships even when nurses and PCTs did not share a
visible demographic attribute. One young, white, U.S.-born nurse related:
PCTs, they have a heavy, heavy job. They need our help, just like we need it from
them. . . . It's definitely a give and take as they have a hard enough job. . . . I've got-
ten to know some [PCTs] pretty well and honestly, their job is more exhausting and
they are paid almost nothing. Some work two jobs.
In contrast, on Unit B, few nurses and PCTs shared visible social identity
characteristics. The consolidation of social identity characteristics with occupa-
tion led to intergroup dislike, discomfort, and anxiety, and it reduced empathy
and perspective taking during cross-occupational social and work interactions.3
Many PCTs on Unit B told us they felt uncomfortable approaching the nursing
group in the nursing station, even when they had important questions, and
3 Gender was not used by nurse­PCT dyads as a shared social identity to draw on in these two
feminized occupations. Because nearly all the nurses and PCTs at Huron were women, gender was
not a salient social identity relative to other social identities in which there was variation, such as
race, age, and immigration status. Gender alone may also have been too broad an identity to pro-
vide a platform as a meaningful commonality. For example, some white women may want to con-
nect on gender, but some women of color resist because they feel their experiences are distinctive
(Cole, 1986; hooks, 1984). But many of the shared social identities drawn upon on Unit A had fem-
inized elements, such as motherhood.
390 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
multiple PCTs commented on the poor interpersonal relations between nurses
and PCTs. One stated, ``No nurse is going to be your friend here. . . . They
don't care about me or love me.'' Another stated, ``PCTs and nurses are not so
close . . . we only have love for our own.'' In addition, nurses on Unit B, unlike
Unit A, rarely greeted PCTs when seeing them for the first time during their
shift. As one PCT said, ``[Nurses] won't even say hi to you. They pretend you're
not there or they come up to you and just give you an order or tell you some-
thing, being all business you know, without asking how you're doing.''
Use of Dyadic Toolkits
On Unit A, the use of non-occupational social identities in interactions broa-
dened the set of status rules, emotional scripts, meanings, and expertise avail-
able to nurse­PCT dyads and allowed them to work with one another in non-
traditional ways across occupational boundaries. In contrast, the consolidated
demographics of Unit B inhibited nurses' and PCTs' use of non-occupational
social identities in interactions. Even the nurses and PCTs who shared social
identities did not draw on them to help them collaborate. In addition, the many
salient differences in social identities between nurses and PCTs on Unit B exa-
cerbated collaboration challenges that stemmed from occupational differences,
and collaboration on Unit B failed.
Collaboration across different occupational status. The cross-cutting
demographics on Unit A allowed nurses and PCTs to draw on shared social
identities and successfully negotiate tasks and communicate across occupa-
tional differences in status. For example, Nurse17A and PCT6A differed in
occupation and race--Nurse17A identified as white while PCT6A identified as
African-American--but were both older and U.S.-born. In their social interac-
tions, they often drew on their common status position as older people to act
according to prescriptions of older, hard workers even though doing so ran
counter to occupational status rules. Nurse17A told PCT6A, ``Once [a manager
Nurse17A had in the past] wrote me up for being too conscientious, like it was
a negative thing. . . . I think there is just a different work ethic with this new
generation and I'm old school.'' And PCT6A said to us:
I like a nurse who works as hard as we [PCTs] do and pulls their weight equally
around here. If they have the same idea as me and want to come here and work hard
and get the job done, I like that. That's just how I was raised--my generation is like
that you know. [Nurse17A] is just like me in that way.
Nurse17A often emptied bedpans for patients when working with PCT6A
even though this was considered to be PCT work, but the occupational order
was by no means overturned. Our field notes show that when they were both
free, PCT6A did the PCT work, but when PCT6A was busy, Nurse17A often
helped by performing this lower-status work.
In addition to drawing on shared social identities to perform tasks across jur-
isdictional boundaries, nurses and PCTs used the broadened dyadic toolkit pro-
vided by these shared social identities to communicate in non-traditional ways.
For example, Nurse44A and PCT10A differed in occupation, but they shared a
common identity as young, French-Creole-speaking women from families of
DiBenigno and Kellogg 391
Haitian immigrants. In social interactions, they frequently spoke in French-
Creole and talked about their relatives still in Haiti. They also followed egalitar-
ian communication rules when socializing. For example, PCT10A initiated joking
and socializing with Nurse44A, and they frequently touched each other on the
shoulders or arms when they spoke, as is customary in Haiti. When they com-
municated with one another during work interactions, they drew on the social
identity of two equal-in-status Haitians rather than drawing on the social identi-
ties of a higher-status nurse and a lower-status PCT. Our field notes show, for
example, that contrary to occupational communication rules, one evening when
PCT10A was with a patient in a ``contaminated'' room, she initiated an order to
Nurse44A, because if PCT10A had left the room, she would have needed to
put on new gear to reenter the room:
PCT10A, who is dressed in full contact precaution attire [a disposable one-time-use
yellow gown, gloves, and facemask], sticks her head out of a patient room. She calls
out to Nurse44A, who is a little bit further down the hallway, ``[Nurse44A], can you
get me some more towels?'' Nurse44A replies, ``Sure,'' and runs to grab PCT10A
some towels and brings them to her.
In contrast, in Unit B's consolidated social structure, nurse­PCT dyads
did not draw on shared social identities in interactions. For example, PCT3B
and Nurse1B differed in occupation, race, and immigration status, but both
were older. Nurse1B did not help PCT3B with her work because she felt
constrained by occupational in-group pressure. She said, ``I'm from a genera-
tion that was trained in the old school way of doing everything for the patient--
toileting, bathing, feeding--stuff the PCTs do now. Sometimes I miss doing
that stuff because you get more time at the bedside, but it doesn't go over well
with the girls here.'' The in-group pressure on Unit B was so strong that, on
occasions when Unit B nurses did perform PCT tasks such as toileting, many
demonstrated they knew this was counter-normative behavior by gagging,
swatting the air in front of their faces, and plugging their noses.
The consolidated demographics on Unit B also meant that most nurses
and PCTs at the dyad level did not share any visible social identities. In these
dyads, status differences in race, age, and immigration status frequently exa-
cerbated occupational status differences. For example, Nurse7B and PCT4B
differed not only in occupation but also in terms of race, age, and immigration
status--Nurse7B identified as white and was young and U.S.-born, while
PCT4B identified as black and was an older Jamaican immigrant. One eve-
ning, PCT4B informed Nurse7B about a bleeding patient. Nurse7B listened to
PCT4B but did not go check on the patient. Later that evening, PCT4B
attempted to handle this issue on her own, even though it was a matter that
required assessment by a nurse. She said that she did not feel comfortable
speaking up to challenge Nurse7B's judgment. As we recorded in field
notes:
``I told [Nurse7B], and she said it's not very much [blood], but she didn't even come
look. But look--it's a lot of blood!'' She pulls up his Johnny [gown] and there is a
large amount of dried blood on his leg as well as a trickle of bright red blood coming
from his stomach. PCT4B takes a wash cloth and dries the blood up and finds the
392 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
source on his stomach saying, ``It's still bleeding--fresh blood. I'm gonna need to
tape on some gauze.''
Collaboration across different occupational emotion rules. Drawing on
shared social identities helped nurses and PCTs on Unit A relate effectively
despite differences in prescribed occupational emotional rules and scripts, such
as by helping them to disagree constructively with one another. For example,
Nurse14A and PCT12A differed in occupation and age--Nurse14A was young,
while PCT12A was older--but they shared the identity of black immigrants,
though from different countries. They frequently chatted about planning long-
awaited vacations home to visit their families and expressed frustration over
their limited number of vacation days and rules about how much vacation they
could take at once. They also challenged one another's judgment about strate-
gies for asking their manager for large chunks of time off and contested one
another's ideas in a playful manner by jokingly hitting one another when they
disagreed. Our field notes show that when Nurse14A and PCT12A worked
together, they drew on this broadened dyadic toolkit of feeling rules for expres-
sing disagreement:
Nurse14A stops us in the hallway, touches PCT12A on the shoulder and says, ``You
know, we picked up two people in 45.'' PCT12A seems confused and says, ``What
time? 11? It's not on the paper.'' She checks her notes and playfully pushes
Nurse14A away, saying, ``I don't have them; they're not on my paper!'' Nurse14A
smiles and pushes PCT12A back saying, ``No I put them on at 11. You have 45. It's on
the schedule.'' PCT12A playfully flicks her wrist and lightly hits Nurse14A on the arm
and says, ``No you didn't.'' Nurse14A smiles and laughs, ``Yes, it's on the schedule.''
Nurses and PCTs on Unit A also drew on shared social identities to forgive
one another for mistakes. For example, Nurse45A and PCT6A differed in occu-
pation and race--Nurse45A identified as white, while PCT6A identified as
African-American--but they were both older and U.S.-born. They often drew on
a broadened set of emotional scripts related to their shared identity as grand-
mothers who were thrifty shoppers to express emotions such as empathy
toward one another in social interactions. For example, they frequently sat next
to one another in the nursing station clipping coupons during downtime while
listening to each other's problems, particularly related to their grandchildren
and to feeling extremely busy with home responsibilities. During these ses-
sions, they provided one another with emotional support and advice. They
drew on this broadened set of emotional scripts in work interactions with one
another. For example, even though nurses were often quick to express nega-
tive emotions toward PCTs when PCTs made mistakes, we observed
Nurse45A being empathetic and forgiving with PCT6A one evening when
PCT6A forgot to take a needed sample:
Nurse45A says to PCT6A, ``Remember, we need to guaiac him too [take a sample].''
PCT6A sighs and says, ``Sorry, next time I will. There was just so much.'' Nurse45A
laughs and PCT6A laughs as well. Nurse45A says, ``Don't worry about it! Oh, and I
did signs on 40 at 10 [took vital signs at 10 P.M.], so don't worry about that.'' PCT6A
smiles and replies, ``Thanks!''
DiBenigno and Kellogg 393
In contrast, the consolidated demographics on Unit B did not facilitate
nurses and PCTs relating effectively with one another. Perhaps because of the
strict enforcement of occupational norms on Unit B, even when Unit B nurse­
PCT dyads did share a common identity, such as mothers or older workers, we
did not observe them drawing on this shared social identity in social or work
interactions. For example, PCT2B and Nurse4B differed in occupation, race,
immigration status, and age, but PCT2B was a mother of three, and Nurse4B
was visibly pregnant with her first child. One evening we observed PCT2B
attempt to relate with Nurse4B by talking about her own experience with preg-
nancy. Nurse4B rejected PCT2B's attempts with short, one-word answers:
PCT2B says to Nurse4B, who is seven months pregnant with her first child: ``My first
used to kick me all the time at work. Does yours do that?'' Nurse4B replies, ``What?
No.'' Nurse4B quickly changes the subject and asks PCT2B whether a patient's blood
sugar has been taken yet.
Though Nurse4B did not talk with PCT2B about her pregnancy, we observed
her talking at length to other nurses about it.
In addition to promoting negative dynamics between nurses and PCTs who
shared social identities, the consolidated demographics on Unit B also meant
that most nurse­PCT dyads shared no obvious social identities. In these dyads,
the differences in emotion rules stemming from different non-occupational
social identities exacerbated differences stemming from occupational identi-
ties. For example, Nurse37B and PCT18B differed in race, age, and immigration
status. In addition to drawing on different occupational feeling rules, Nurse37B
and PCT18B also drew on different feeling rules related to their non-
occupational social identities. One evening PCT18B shared with us that, a few
nights earlier, Nurse37B had left her midway through cleaning a patient right
before the shift change so that PCT18B had to stay late to finish on her own.
PCT18B explained that she hadn't expressed her annoyance to Nurse37B, in
part, because she was concerned about being labeled as having an ``attitude''
(a term associated with negative racial stereotypes for blacks) and being reta-
liated against: ``You know me, I cooperate. I act like nothing happened. I never
let her know. I didn't tell her because that would lead to more issues. She'd
say I have an `attitude' if I tried fighting back.''
Collaboration across different occupational meanings. Many nurses and
PCTs on Unit A were able to collaborate successfully with one another by
drawing on a broader cultural toolkit of shared meanings afforded by a common
social identity at the dyad level. Drawing on these shared social identities
helped nurses and PCTs respect one another's beliefs and values. For example,
Nurse9A and PCT21A were similar in age but differed in occupation, race, and
immigration status--Nurse9A was an Indian immigrant, while PCT21A was
U.S.-born and white. But they had found the nonvisible identity of mother to
help frame their interactions with one another. They frequently talked about
their children, and they often shared parenting philosophies, such as the impor-
tance of doing reading and writing exercises with their children at home in addi-
tion to sending them to preschool. Their demonstrated appreciation of one
another's beliefs and values about parenting sometimes spilled over into their
394 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
work interactions, where we saw them indulge and appreciate one another's
occupation-related beliefs and values. For example, one evening, PCT21A
explained her belief about speaking kindly to a comatose patient to Nurse9A,
and Nurse9A, though initially not understanding, proceeded to go along with
PCT21A, changing her interaction with the patient to suit PCT21A's preferred
style:
Nurse9A and PCT21A head over to their patient's room. PCT21A brightly greets the
patient and says, ``Hi Christopher!'' Nurse9A looks at PCT21A quizzically and says,
``He doesn't respond. He's completely dependent--a veggie.'' PCT21A replies confi-
dently, ``I know but I like to say hi anyway.'' PCT21A continues [to the patient],
``We're gonna reposition you now.'' Nurse9A begins to copy PCT21A's interaction
style and says softly and sincerely, ``Hi Christopher! I'll clean your mouth, ok?''
PCT21A and Nurse9A continue to talk to the patient as if he were sentient while they
clean and change him.
Drawing on shared social identities also helped nurses and PCTs on Unit A
adjust their demeanor to suit one another's preferred patient interaction style.
For example, Nurse72A and PCT26A were members of different occupations,
but they were both young, white locals. In their social interactions with one
another, they often shared stories of their weekend escapades and drew on
the common demeanor of young partiers as they assertively joked with one
another. When interacting with Nurse72A, PCT26A often acted counter to the
occupationally prescribed reserved and quiet PCT demeanor:
Nurse72A asks PCT26A, ``How was your weekend? Did you end up going to that
party?'' PCT26A replies, ``My weekend was good. I ended up staying out last night
way later than I wanted to. . . .'' Nurse72A laughs and then holds up in the air a plas-
tic bag containing three pairs of underwear that a discharged patient left behind in
her room. She gestures toward PCT26A and jokes, ``Are those yours? Do you want
some new underwear?'' PCT26A jokes back, ``No, you should take them since you're
probably not wearing any.'' They both laugh.
When they worked together, they drew on this broadened set of demeanors
to act assertively toward patients. For example, while the PCT occupational
demeanor prescribed being reserved with patients when in front of nurses, we
saw PCT26A openly joke with patients in Nurse72A's presence:
We head into the room of a new admission to take vital signs. Nurse72A is in the
room introducing herself to the patient saying, ``My name is [Nurse72A] and I'll be
your nurse . . . [she sees PCT26A come in] and this is [PCT26A]. She's working with
me.'' PCT26A greets the patient warmly saying, ``How are you tonight?'' The patient
replies, ``I'm great, thanks.'' PCT26A jokes back saying, ``Then why are you here?''
Nurse72A laughs and the patient replies, ``Well I guess I could be better.'' Everyone
laughs.
The situation on Unit B differed greatly. For example, PCT18B and Nurse23B
differed in occupation, race, and immigration status, but both were older. While
we observed many nurse­PCT dyads on Unit A draw on a shared social identity
like age to judge the actions of members of the other group as appropriate
even though doing so ran counter to traditional occupational meanings, we did
DiBenigno and Kellogg 395
not observe PCT18B and Nurse23B do this. Being older was a devalued iden-
tity in this context and, on Unit B, the immediately visible association between
occupational position and race, age, and immigration status activated the use
of common negative stereotypes about traditionally devalued social identities.
Perhaps for this reason, Nurse23B did not connect with PCT18B over this
shared identity:
Nurse23B stands at the outside of the nursing station and stretches her back.
PCT18B notices her and says, ``My back hurts too. Guess we're just getting old!''
Nurse23B appears caught off guard, and as the other nurses turn to look at her,
Nurse23B replies curtly, ``My back is fine. You're only as old as you feel.''
On Unit B, occupational meaning differences were also intensified by differ-
ences in cultural beliefs and values and identity-appropriate demeanors that
stemmed from differences in visible social identities. For example, Nurse8B
and PCT4B differed not only in occupation but also in race, age, and immigra-
tion status. Nurse8B had grown up in the Northeast where the ethic of a fast-
paced life oriented around efficiency was the norm, while PCT4B had spent
more of her life in Jamaica, which she described as having a slower pace of life
and as valuing relationships. PCT4B often interpreted Nurse8B's quick pace as
typical of ``work-obsessed'' Americans, and said she refused to let herself be
rushed when Nurse8B was working rapidly to accomplish certain tasks:
``People here [in the U.S.] don't know how to relax. Where I come from, it's
not like that. You know I work hard. But there's no need to act like that'' (she
points to Nurse8B who just ran by us, sighing and calling out behind her to
another nurse). Nurse8B likewise had difficulty appreciating PCT4B's
``Jamaican'' demeanor at work: ``Nurse8B says to me, `I'm gonna page PCT4B.
It will probably take her like 10 minutes to get in there' (she rolls her eyes as
she speaks). She goes over to the call-light computer and sends her a text page
that reads, `New admit in 9. Can you do [vital] signs?'''
Collaboration across different occupational expertise. Finally, many of
the nurse­PCT dyads on Unit A drew on broader sets of expertise afforded by
a shared social identity, despite the fact that nurses relied primarily on compu-
terized information while PCTs relied primarily on sensory information to do
their work. For example, Nurse17A and PCT2A differed in race and age--
Nurse17A identified as white and was older, while PCT2A identified as black
and was younger. But both were born in the U.S., and they shared social identi-
ties as locals who were raised in the surrounding area and were avid fans of
their city's sports teams. In their social interactions with one another, they
often discussed highlights from recent games and shared player statistics and
their own feel for their team's chances of beating rival teams and advancing to
the playoffs. During these exchanges, they often went to the computer for
game updates. PCT2A acted outside of the bounds of PCT occupational norms
by using the computer, but the cross-cutting demographics on Unit A wea-
kened occupational in-group pressure, and they appeared unconcerned about
being sanctioned for their behavior; they were quite vocal in front of other
nurses and PCTs about going to the computer to check scores.
396 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
When they engaged in work interactions, they drew on the same routines
they used for sharing information about player statistics and how their teams
were performing. For example, one evening, Nurse17A asked for PCT2A's sen-
sory information about how a patient had been breathing the evening before,
and Nurse17A shared with PCT2A some computerized nursing information and
explained the medical reasoning around a care decision:
Nurse17A and PCT2A roll the patient so Nurse17A can assess his skin. . . . The
patient begins to wheeze violently. Nurse17A looks concerned and asks PCT2A, ``Did
he get like this yesterday?'' PCT2A, ``Yes, he was just like this.'' Nurse17A tries to
soothe the patient and listens again to his throat with the stethoscope. Nurse17A
then says to PCT2A, ``I think I'm going to get a humidifier for him, to help loosen the
secretions in his throat.'' PCT2A replies, ``I think that's a good idea.'' Nurse17A adds,
``And I checked the computer earlier, and he is at risk for a seizure, so he should have
a green pad.''
Nurses and PCTs on Unit A also drew on common social identities to share
expertise despite differences in occupational knowledge bases. For example,
Nurse24A and PCT12A differed in race, age, and immigration status, but we
saw them use their common, nonvisible identity of working mother to help
frame their interactions. Nurse24A was a new mother, and PCT12A was the
mother of two older boys. In their social interactions with one another,
Nurse24A often asked for advice about taking care of a newborn, and PCT12A
often provided her with advice about being a working mother. In these interac-
tions, they discussed both abstract expertise (e.g., different theories of mother-
ing) and idiosyncratic, child-specific expertise, such as how to help this
particular baby sleep.
Because nurses privilege abstract, formal knowledge of diseases, medica-
tions, and lab results in guiding their decision making, they often consider
PCTs' knowledge to be irrelevant. But Nurse24A and PCT12A's expertise-
sharing routines around being working mothers carried over into work interac-
tions in which Nurse24A expressed interest in PCT12A's occupational knowl-
edge and expertise. For example, one evening, Nurse24A asked for PCT12A's
patient-specific expertise around a patient PCT12A had just attended to. And
Nurse24A shared with PCT12A her abstract expertise on interpreting this
patient's unusual behavior, even though most nurses did not spend time teach-
ing PCTs the medical rationale behind their work:
Nurse24A and I leave the room and pass PCT12A, who had just attended to the bed
alarm on a shared patient. Nurse24A says to PCT12A, ``How is he? Is he acting up?''
PCT12A says, ``He's confusing me. He says he wants to eat. So I ask him what he
wants to eat and he says he wants a sandwich but now he's saying no to a sandwich
and he said he lost $50 and has to go get it.'' Nurse24A replies sympathetically,
``Well he came in drunk. The most dangerous thing having to do with withdrawal is
withdrawing from alcohol, that's why we have to keep watching him.''
In contrast, the consolidated social structure on Unit B prevented nurses
and PCTs from drawing on non-occupational social identities to share expertise
with one another across occupation-specific bodies of knowledge, sources of
information, and patient-care skills. For example, PCT22B and Nurse11B dif-
fered in occupation, race, age, and immigration status. Based on private
DiBenigno and Kellogg 397
conversations with them, we knew they shared a common social identity as
mothers of two boys, but to our knowledge they never discovered this com-
monality, perhaps because of the strong levels of dislike between occupational
groups on Unit B. For example, one night Nurse11B asked every nurse what
type of frozen yogurt they wanted to order in but did not ask PCT22B or any of
the other PCTs working nearby.
The lack of cross-cutting demographics on Unit B not only promoted nega-
tive dynamics among nurses and PCTs at the unit level but also meant that
nurses and PCTs at the dyad level rarely shared visible social identities.
Differences in occupational expertise were magnified by differences in cultural
knowledge, proficiency with information technology, and assumptions about
skills that stemmed from differences in race, immigration status, and age, in
addition to differences in occupation. For example, Nurse39B and PCT3B dif-
fered not only in occupation but also in race, age, and immigration status. Their
occupational differences in fluency with computerized information were exacer-
bated by differences in life experience with computers, which stemmed from
their other differing non-occupational social identities. As a young, upper-
middle-class woman, Nurse39B had grown up with computers, owned a
personal computer, and was extremely adept at using computers for work and
leisure. In contrast, PCT3B had come from a farming family in Liberia before
immigrating to the U.S. and had never owned a computer.
One evening, Nurse39B related to us that she did not see the value in meet-
ing to share information with PCT3B because ``[PCT3B] can just check the
computer.'' Later that evening, we saw PCT3B trying to access Huron's elec-
tronic patient management portal to review the basic care information on her
patients, but she had difficulty doing so (in part because the portal underwent
multiple major updates during the 12 months we observed). Giving up on
accessing the computer to find out a new patient's restrictions on taking blood
pressure, she went to see the patient and asked him to tell her the arm on
which he preferred to have his blood pressure taken. He said the left arm, and
she began checking his blood pressure. Nurse39B came in, gasped, and said in
an annoyed tone of voice, ``[PCT3B]! Can you use the other arm? The IV is in
this one.'' PCT3B replied calmly, ``I know, but he told me this arm and I listen
to them.'' Nurse39B's eyes got big, and she huffed out a puff of air. Ignoring
PCT3B, she turned to the patient and said, ``[PCT3B] will take your blood pres-
sure and I'll be back.''
Possible Alternative Explanations
Though our analysis showed that cross-cutting demographics between occupa-
tional groups on Unit A generated intergroup dynamics that allowed members
of cross-occupational dyads to collaborate successfully by drawing on a shared
social identity in their interactions with one another, there are two important
alternative explanations for the successful cross-occupational collaboration we
observed, as well as others that we address in Online Appendix B. First, can
the successful cross-occupational collaboration on Unit A and its failure on Unit
B be explained by unit-wide differences in culture or selection and retention
processes? If this were so, we would have expected to see all nurse­PCT
dyads on Unit A engage in successful cross-occupational collaboration, and
we did not. Even though Unit A's social structure was characterized by
398 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
cross-cutting demographics, there were a handful of nurse­PCT dyads on the
unit that did not collaborate well because they did not share or discover a social
identity that enabled sufficiently strong identification to overcome their other
differences. Two of these six dyads had no visible common social identity in
race, age, or immigration status; their life experiences stemming from their
other social identities were extremely different and did not provide any com-
mon platforms for shared identification. The other four dyads on Unit A that did
not collaborate well with one another did share at least one visible common
social identity. One shared an immigrant identity (but differed in age and race),
one shared an age identity (but differed in race and immigration status), one
shared a racial identity (but differed in age and immigration status), and one
shared both age and racial identities (but differed in immigration status). In each
case, the dyads either did not experience their common identities as truly
shared or there were too many other differences to overcome for the common-
ality to create a sufficient bridge (e.g., they also differed in marital status, ethni-
city, motherhood status, and/or country of origin). For example, in one dyad,
both members were black but had different ethnicities--one was African and
one was African-American--and they experienced their racial identities
differently.
Second, was it individual personality characteristics that drove the uncolla-
borative interactions between the nurses and PCTs? Our data suggest this is
not the case. We observed members of each of these six Unit A dyads have
successful social and working relationships with other nurses and PCTs with
whom they drew on shared non-occupational social identities. For example,
PCT2A and Nurse7A did not share or discover a common social identity and did
not collaborate well with one another. But they were each able to collaborate
well with other staff with whom they had identified a shared social identity.
DISCUSSION
Differences in occupational status rules, emotional scripts, meanings, and
expertise can make it difficult for members of different occupations to collabo-
rate with one another even when the organization provides collaboration tools.
We found that these differences can be overcome in social structures where
cross-cutting demographics facilitate cross-occupational dyads' use of shared,
non-occupational social identities in their interactions with one another. Using
shared social identities expands their dyadic toolkit of available status rules,
meanings, emotional scripts, and expertise, guides their interactions, and
allows them to work successfully with one another across occupational differ-
ences, as figure 1 illustrates.
In our study, Unit A was characterized by a social structure in which occupa-
tional status was uncorrelated with demographic characteristics, meaning that
those who occupied a high-level position in the occupational hierarchy (nurses)
frequently did not possess only high-status social identities, and members who
occupied a low-level position in the occupational hierarchy (PCTs) frequently did
not possess only low-status social identities. The cross-cutting demographics
on Unit A promoted three kinds of intergroup dynamics between nurses and
PCTs: (1) the valuing of traditionally devalued identities, (2) low occupational in-
group pressure, and (3) feelings of intergroup comfort and liking even among
members who did not share visible demographic characteristics. These

intergroup dynamics loosened the occupational identity and status order on
Unit A, allowing nurse­PCT dyads to draw on a shared social identity to guide
their interactions with one another. Even though most dyads on Unit A differed
on at least one visible demographic characteristic, most of these dyads drew
on a shared identity in their interactions with one another. This shared identity
afforded them a dyadic toolkit of shared non-occupational status rules, mean-
ings, emotional scripts, and expertise that they used to collaborate successfully
with one another across occupational differences.
On Unit B, in contrast, the consolidated demographics activated the use of
common negative stereotypes about traditionally devalued identities, led to
strong occupational in-group pressure, and fostered discomfort and disliking
between occupational groups. This social structure inhibited nurses' and PCTs'
use of shared social identities in interactions. Even the nurses and PCTs who
shared social identities did not draw on them to help them collaborate. In addi-
tion, the many salient differences in social identities between nurses and PCTs
on Unit B exacerbated collaboration challenges that stemmed from occupa-
tional differences, and collaboration on Unit B failed. These findings about
cross-cutting demographics and dyadic toolkits contribute to both the literature
on cross-occupational collaboration and the literature on demography and inter-
group relations.
Cross-occupational Collaboration
We make three contributions to the literature on cross-occupational collabora-
tion. First, in terms of barriers to successful cross-occupational collaboration,
prior studies have shown that differences in occupational status, shared mean-
ings, and expertise make it challenging for members of different occupations
to collaborate (e.g., Carlile, 2004; Kaplan, 2008). Our findings demonstrate that
cross-occupational collaboration difficulties can stem not only from occupa-
tional differences but also from demographic differences and suggest that the
current literature may be overstating the occupational character of cross-
occupational collaboration difficulties and understating their demographic char-
acter. Our findings suggest that previous studies may be attributing more to
occupational differences than justified. We find that, in consolidated social
structures, which occur frequently given strong occupational clustering by race,
gender, age, and immigration status, dyad-level differences in status rules,
emotion rules, meanings, and expertise stemming from different non-
occupational social identities can exacerbate occupational differences and lead
to failed collaboration.
Second, in terms of when successful cross-occupational collaboration can
occur, the current literature demonstrates that it can occur when members
have access to organizational tools provided by top managers such as rules and
routines, boundary objects, and common spaces (see Okhuysen and Bechky,
2009, for a review). Even when such tools are available, however, collaboration
often fails, as members of higher-status occupations use these very tools to
enforce occupational boundaries to protect their privilege (Bechky, 2003a).
Because nurses and PCTs on both units had access to the same rules and rou-
tines, boundary objects, and common spaces but collaborated differently, our
research shows that the use of such collaboration tools to overcome or rein-
force boundaries can be shaped by the degree of cross-cutting demographics
DiBenigno and Kellogg 401
in the social structure. Cross-cutting demographics at the unit level promote
particular intergroup dynamics that loosen attachments to the occupational
identity and status order and allow members of different occupational groups
to draw on a shared social identity at the dyad level that enables collaboration.
Third, in terms of how successful cross-occupational collaboration occurs,
the current literature shows that it occurs when members use organizational
tools to facilitate the negotiation of status, translation of meanings, and com-
munication of expertise across occupational boundaries (e.g., Bechky, 2003b;
Kellogg, Orlikowski, and Yates, 2006). Our findings show that successful colla-
boration can also occur when members of different occupational groups draw
on a shared non-occupational social identity that broadens their dyadic toolkit.
This dyadic toolkit provides them with alternative status rules that allow them
to successfully negotiate tasks and communicate across occupational differ-
ences in status, alternative emotional scripts that allow them to express dis-
agreement and forgiveness with one another, alternative beliefs, values, and
demeanors that allow them to understand and appreciate one another's
actions, and alternative bodies of knowledge, information, and skills that allow
them to share occupation-specific expertise. In some ways, our finding about
the importance of a shared social identity is akin to Bechky's (2003b) finding
about the importance of ``common ground'' to cross-occupational collaboration.
But Bechky's design engineers, technicians, and assemblers found common
ground by coming into one another's physical work spaces, and our nurses and
PCTs found common ground by drawing on a shared, non-occupational identity
in interactions.
Demography and Intergroup Relations
This paper also makes several contributions to our understanding of demogra-
phy and intergroup relations. First, scholars have shown that occupational
demography matters for individual outcomes such as members' experience,
access to advancement, and equity with regard to pay and other privileges
(e.g., Tomaskovic-Devey, 1993; Fernandez and Fernandez-Mateo, 2006). We
demonstrate that it also matters for organizational outcomes such as cross-
occupational collaboration. Cross-cutting demographics promote positive inter-
group identification experiences that provide dyads with an expanded toolkit of
status rules, emotional scripts, meanings, and expertise to help them over-
come differences and collaborate successfully.
Second, scholars have shown that cross-cutting demographics facilitate
three psychological processes that promote positive intergroup relations: the
valuing of traditionally devalued identities because of the proportional represen-
tation of low-status group members in high-status positions (Ely, 1994, 1995),
low in-group pressure because of a high degree of intersecting group affilia-
tions that exert diverse and often counteracting identity pressures (e.g., Blau
and Schwartz, 1984), and intergroup liking and trust via direct and indirect
effects of homophilous cross-group interactions (e.g., Pettigrew and Tropp,
2006; Pettigrew et al., 2011). We find that these psychological processes
loosen attachment to the dominant identity and status order and allow inter-
group dyads to discover a shared identity that can serve as a source of connec-
tion, identification, and collaboration. These findings also help explain the
mechanism underlying what other scholars refer to as ``weak faultlines'' (e.g.,
402 Administrative Science Quarterly 59 (2014)
Lau and Murnighan, 1998). Previous scholarship in the faultlines tradition has
attributed positive outcomes from weak faultlines to the absence of polarizing,
strong faultlines. We specify a mechanism that suggests how weak faultlines
may lead to better intergroup relations and outcomes: the loosening of attach-
ment to the dominant identity and status order enables intergroup dyads to
connect around other shared social identities and improves intergroup relations
and collaboration.
Third, the current literature suggests that intergroup contact facilitates posi-
tive intergroup relations under a particular set of conditions: when the two
groups are equal in status, when authorities support interaction between the
two groups (Pettigrew et al., 2011), when the groups share a superordinate
goal (Allport, 1954), when the teams' learning environment is seen as suppor-
tive (Foldy, Rivard, and Buckley, 2009; Ely, Padavic, and Thomas, 2012), or
when cultural differences are valued (Ely and Thomas, 2001; Apfelbaum,
Norton, and Sommers, 2012). Our findings demonstrate that positive inter-
group dynamics can result even when the two groups are unequal in status
(e.g., occupation) as long as there are cross-cutting demographics so that other
status-laden characteristics are equally distributed across groups. Our findings
also suggest that organizations responding to calls to ``increase diversity'' need
to attend to issues of status and hierarchy. And that means ensuring diversity
across all levels of the occupational hierarchy within the organization.
Future Research
These findings raise several questions for future research. First, we have
advanced a model of how cross-occupational dyads can use the dyadic toolkits
provided by their shared social identities to collaborate successfully with one
another, but we were not able to model the process by which dyads come to
find these shared social identities. On Unit A, even dyads with no visible, com-
mon demographic characteristic often used a shared, nonvisible identity to help
guide their interactions. Future research could gather data on cross-
occupational dyads from when they first encounter one another to map the pro-
cess by which dyads discover shared social identities.
Second, we show that cross-occupational dyads may fail to collaborate suc-
cessfully even when they both work in a social structure with cross-cutting
demographics and share a visible social identity. We suggest this happens
when the dyads do not experience their common identities as truly shared or
because there are too many other differences to overcome for the commonal-
ity to create a sufficient bridge. This is consistent with research on intersection-
ality, which shows that it is imperative to examine all the ways different social
identities interact. For example, important variation is missed when scholars
lump together all black people without considering how their other social identi-
ties, such as age, nationality, gender, or immigration status, affect cognition
and action (Collins, 1998; Acker, 2006; Holvino, 2010; Vallas and Cummins,
2013). Because we observed only a handful of these cases of failed cross-
occupational collaboration among dyads working in a social structure with
cross-cutting demographics who share a visible social identity, we were not
able to fully explore the mechanisms associated with their failure. For example,
with our data, we cannot rule out the possibility that these dyads failed to colla-
borate because of interpersonal issues or conflict within the dyad rather than
DiBenigno and Kellogg 403
because of identity differences. Future research could investigate these
mechanisms. What our study has shown, however, is that demography and
shared social identities are critical to increasing our understanding of how peo-
ple can move beyond occupational differences to work effectively together.
