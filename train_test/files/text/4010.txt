Abstract
The significance, mechanisms and consequences of coronary microvascular dysfunction associated
with diabetes mellitus are topics into which we have insufficient insight at this time. It is widely
recognized that endothelial dysfunction that is caused by diabetes in various vascular beds
contributes to a wide range of complications and exerts unfavorable effects on microcirculatory
regulation. The coronary microcirculation is precisely regulated through a number of intercon-
nected physiological processes with the purpose of matching local blood flow to myocardial
metabolic demands. Dysregulation of this network might contribute to varying degrees of
pathological consequences. This review discusses the most important findings regarding coronary
microvascular dysfunction in diabetes from pre-clinical and clinical perspectives.

Coronary microcirculation dysfunction
associated with diabetes, although explored
extensively in recent years,3 still represents a
poorly understood phenomenon in the clin-
ical setting. Endothelial dysfunction, with its
unfavorable consequences in various vascu-
lar beds, has been widely recognized to be a
result of pathophysiological processes in
diabetes,4­6 with less information available
in the context of the coronary microvascu-
lature. Functional changes precede morpho-
logical changes,3 and therefore timely
recognition of this problem and identifica-
tion of appropriate action strategies will be
crucial in successful future care of patients.
The purpose of this review is to discuss the
most important findings regarding coronary
microvascular dysfunction in diabetes, from
pre-clinical and clinical perspectives,
because this topic has become of greater
interest to researchers and clinicians in
recent years. This field of research is espe-
cially relevant when considering the increas-
ing morbidity, as well as the relatively high
mortality, as discussed later. Additional
knowledge and a greater awareness of the
issue among professionals in a wide range of
fields are needed to facilitate earlier diagno-
sis and development of effective treatment
strategies. Thus, a review of the most essen-
tial information is useful.
Endothelial dysfunction
in diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular
disease
In individuals with type 2 diabetes, there is
accelerated development and an increased
incidence of atherosclerotic vascular lesions.
Furthermore, cardiovascular disease, such
as myocardial infarction and stroke, is 2 to 4
times more prevalent in patients with type 2
diabetes than in non-diabetic individuals.
Even with impaired glucose tolerance only,
there is an increased risk of
atherosclerosis.7­9
Diabetic complications affect many
organs and are responsible for most
illnesses and deaths associated with diabetes.
They can be categorized as vascular or
non-vascular complications. Vascular com-
plications can be microvascular (microangio-
pathy), such as retinopathy or nephropathy,
or macrovascular (macroangiopathy),
including cerebrovascular disease, coronary
artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular
disease. Non-vascular complications include
forms of chronic neuropathy. In addition to
hyperglycaemia, other factors, including
hypertension, dyslipidemia, genetic factors,
glucose oscillations, hypoglycaemia, obesity,
coagulopathy and smoking, contribute to the
development of chronic complications.7,10­12
The leading cause of death in people with
diabetes is heart and blood vessel disease
(70­80%). The risk of heart and blood vessel
disease is 8 times higher in people with
diabetes. Patients with diabetes without
previous heart attacks are at higher risk of
a heart attack as compared with non-
diabetic patients who have previously had
a heart attack. Diabetes is the most common
risk factor for stroke, especially in women
(5.4 times higher risk). Diabetic retinopathy
is a significant cause of blindness, nephro-
pathy is the most important cause of kidney
failure, and diabetic foot is the primary
cause of lower extremity amputations and
the most important cause of disability in
patients.7­11,13,14
Endothelial dysfunction
Normal cells can adapt to changes in the
environment in multiple ways, such as
through changes in the amount and effect-
iveness of enzymes, receptors and other
proteins, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, atrophy
and metaplasia. However, when the capacity
of cells to adapt is exceeded and homeostasis
1902 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
is disturbed, there is damage that can ini-
tially manifest as dysfunction and later as
morphological changes. Cell dysfunction
can become evident as an increase, a reduc-
tion or an interruption of normal function in
a tissue. Irreversible disorders can cause cell
death (necrosis or apoptosis).15,16
The endothelium is the monolayer of cells
that covers the inner vascular wall. It serves
multiple functions that are indispensable for
the maintenance of vascular homeostasis,
including regulation of vessel integrity, vas-
cular tone and blood flow, vascular growth
and remodeling, cell adhesion, angiogenesis,
tissue growth and metabolism, immune
responses, hemostasis and vascular perme-
ability.17 Damage to endothelial cell func-
tion, or ``endothelial dysfunction,'' leads to
leukocyte adhesion and migration and loss
of endothelial antiaggregation properties,
resulting in platelet aggregation and prevail-
ing of vasoconstrictive substances.
Inflammatory mediators, including tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-1
(IL-1) and endotoxin, modify and activate
endothelial cell functions. This leads to
adhesion molecule expression on the surface
of endothelial cells (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-
selectin and P-selectin), cytokine and che-
mokine secretion and reactive oxygen spe-
cies production, which causes LDL-
cholesterol oxidation in the subendothelial
layer. Inflammatory stimuli reinforce the
otherwise minimal connection between
leukocytes and endothelial cells, and this
process is regulated by membrane expres-
sion of adhesion molecules. Thus, the endo-
thelium actively participates in various
stages of the inflammatory response.18­24
Damaged endothelium produces less
nitric oxide (NO) with a consequently
reduced or paradoxical effect of vasodila-
tors, enhanced activity of vasoconstrictors
and increased platelet aggregation.
Endothelial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus
leads to reduced NO production through
decreased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)
expression, eNOS uncoupling (a process
where eNOS is converted from an NO-
producing enzyme to one generating super-
oxide anions) as a result of oxidative stress
and accelerated NO breakdown (mostly
caused by reactive oxygen species).17 In
addition to the reduced NO bioavailability,
endothelial dysfunction in diabetes also
manifests through a number of other mech-
anisms, including decreased endothelial
prostacyclin secretion, altered endothelium-
dependent hyperpolarizing factor-mediated
responses, impaired fibrinolytic ability,
increased procoagulant activity, overpro-
duction of growth factors and extracellular
matrix proteins, increased endothelial per-
meability and increased oxidative stress.17,25
The described mechanisms are also involved
in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic car-
diovascular disease.26­28 Table 1 summar-
izes the primary endothelial dysfunction
traits.
The effect of hyperglycaemia
An important consequence of hypergly-
caemia is increased non-enzymatic protein
glycation. Through a series of reactions,
stable glycated proteins form within the cell,
on the cell surface, in the extracellular
matrix and in the blood stream. The conse-
quences are changes in enzyme activity,
regulatory molecule binding, protein cross
linking, proteolysis susceptibility, macro-
molecular recognition, endocytosis and
immunogenicity, resulting in alterations in
different physiological processes and the
development of chronic diabetic complica-
tions. Haemoglobin glycation is the earliest
and best-studied example of protein glyca-
tion. Determination of haemoglobin glyca-
tion has practical applications, because it
indicates the degree of chronic hypergly-
caemia.11,20,29,30 In addition to augmented
formation of advanced glycation end prod-
ucts, hyperglycaemia leads to vascular
damage in various cells of the vessel wall.
Kibel et al. 1903
This is mediated through mechanisms,
including increased flux of glucose and
other sugars through the polyol pathway,
elevated expression of the receptor for
advanced glycation end products and its
activating ligands, protein kinase C isoform
activation, hexosamine pathway overactiva-
tion and increased reactive oxygen species
production.17
Insulin and vascular dysfunction
Insulin resistance, the defining mechanism
underlying type 2 diabetes, exists when insu-
lin levels are higher than expected relative to
glucose levels. Thus, in vivo insulin resistance
is tethered to hyperinsulinaemia.31 Insulin
leads to increased eNOS activation (and NO
production) through the phosphatidylinosi-
tol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Insulin
resistance in diabetes attenuates this physio-
logical process and suppresses normal NO
secretion.5 Insulin infusion in healthy human
subjects stimulates vasodilation and increases
peripheral tissue blood flow, whereas this
effect is blunted in patients with diabetes and
insulin resistance.4 Furthermore, insulin acti-
vates the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase pathway and promotes endothelin-1
expression and cellular proliferation.32
Under physiological conditions, the PI3K/
Akt pathway prevails in vasomotor regula-
tion. Under insulin resistant conditions, there
is a selective deficiency in this pathway
(leading to endothelial dysfunction), while

MAPK pathway signaling is unaffected,
leading to unfavorable effects, including fur-
ther promotion of hyperinsulinaemia and
atherogenesis.17,32 The hyperinsulinaemic
state is associated with a number of import-
ant pathophysiological processes, such as
elevated free fatty acid and pro-inflammatory
mediator levels.31 The link between endothe-
lial dysfunction and insulin resistance is also
evident in intervention studies that demon-
strate improved endothelial function follow-
ing treatments that improve insulin
sensitivity. For example, metformin, rosigli-
tazone, troglitazone and pioglitazone treat-
ment have been demonstrated to improve
endothelial dysfunction in various vascular
beds.4
Blood glucose control and vascular
complications
Several large epidemiological studies have
attempted to examine the connection
between diabetes management and the
emergence of a number of diabetic compli-
cations.33­35 For example, the Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial, a large
multicenter investigation conducted in 1,400
patients with type 1 diabetes, determined
that improved glycaemic control reduced
nonproliferative and proliferative retinop-
athy by 47%, microalbuminuria by 39%,
clinical nephropathy by 54% and neur-
opathy by 60%. The improvement in gly-
caemic control also slowed the deterioration
of existing complications. The study results
indicated no significant changes in macro-
vascular complications. Similar to the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
study, the United Kingdom Prospective
Diabetes Study, which was conducted in
more than 5,000 patients with type 2 dia-
betes and lasted more than 10 years, sug-
gested an interrelation between glycaemic
control and the development of diabetic
complications. Although no statistically sig-
nificant effect of blood glucose levels on
cardiovascular complications was demon-
strated, there was a 16% reduction in myo-
cardial infarctions. Improved blood glucose
control did not consequently reduce nor
increase mortality from macrovascular com-
plications. Similar results regarding reduced
microvascular complication risk were also
determined in a small study on thin Japanese
patients with type 2 diabetes (Kumamoto
study).33­35 Firm evidence that improved
glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus
can reverse or prevent cardiovascular dis-
ease remains incomplete and requires large,
long-term clinical trials in patients with
diabetes at low risk utilizing modern treat-
ment strategies.36
Physiology of coronary
microcirculation
Coronary microvascular networks are cru-
cial for matching local blood flow to tissue
metabolic demands by precise regulation of
smooth muscle tone, vessel diameter and
substance transport.37,38 Although coronary
microvessels can broadly be divided into
``arterial microvessels'' (through which
blood flows towards capillaries) and
``venous microvessels'' or ``venules'' (those
that drain blood from capillaries), there are
no uniform term definitions for the designa-
tion of microvascular segments, such as
small arteries, arterioles and venules.39
Classification of microvessels based on
structural characteristics is somewhat arbi-
trary, with no abrupt demarcation in the
transition between small artery and arteri-
ole. Some studies define ``microvessels'' as
vessels <300 mm in internal diameter.37,39
Figure 1 illustrates the different microvessel
categories.
Oxygen extraction is almost maximal in
the coronary circulation, and therefore
blood flow must increase proportionally to
increased oxygen demand. Myocardial
oxygen consumption increases by up to
four times during severe exercise compared
Kibel et al. 1905
with consumption at rest.40 When oxygen
consumption is kept constant, coronary
blood flow is constant and independent of
coronary artery pressure variations. In con-
trast, when pressure is kept constant, vari-
ations in oxygen consumption lead to linear
flow variations.40 However, when tissue
regions smaller than 1 g are considered,
flow distribution is heterogenous.40 Precise
regulation of functionally distinct micro-
vascular categories (for example, capillaries
and venules where water and solute are
primarily exchanged, or arterioles where
vascular resistance is predominantly
adjusted) is achieved with specialized mech-
anisms.41 Neurogenic, hormonal, metabolic,
myogenic and flow (shear stress-induced)
endothelial mechanisms control coronary
vascular resistance at specific microvascular
sites.40­42 Segments most sensitive to flow
are coronary arterioles with diameters of
120­150 mm. The greatest myogenic respon-
siveness was observed in small arterioles
with diameters of 30­60 mm. Arterioles
<30 mm appear to be most sensitive to
metabolic stimuli. Flow-induced dilatation
is also a regulating mechanism in isolated
coronary venules and could be important
during arteriolar dilatation, when it would
limit the rise in capillary pressure that occurs
with decreased arteriolar resistance.41
Integration of multiple mechanisms could
hypothetically form a system matching cor-
onary blood flow to myocardial metabolic
demands. However, there are many
unknown or incompletely understood fac-
tors involved, including unclear precise
mediators of the metabolic mechanisms
that have traditionally been attributed as
important in this system.40,41 Reactive
Figure 1. Overview of different microvessel categories in the heart.
Arterial microvessels consist of a thin tunica intima, a thick tunica media composed of one to several layers of
smooth muscle cells (``arterioles'' possess 1­4 layers and are typically defined as <100­150 mm in diameter,
whereas ``large arterial microvessels'' possess 4­6 layers, can be >100­150 mm in diameter and can also be
called ``small arteries'') and a tunica adventitia.39 Venous microvessels have thinner vascular walls compared
with those of arterial microvessels, with venules <50 mm in diameter and not possessing smooth muscle cell
layers. Smaller venules possess only endothelial cells and pericytes.39 From epicardial conduit arteries,
numerous arterial branches arise that contribute to perfusion of the outer two-thirds of the myocardium.
Penetrating arteries pass through the outer myocardial layers without branching. Ultimately, in the inner one-
third of the myocardium, small branches arise from penetrating arteries to form the arterial plexus that
perfuses the subendocardium.39
1906 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
oxygen species, which are metabolites pro-
duced in proportion to oxidative metabol-
ism, may also control coronary blood
flow,42 a phenomenon that is incompletely
understood.
In addition to adaptation to acute
physiological stresses, such as increased
myocardial metabolism, the coronary
microcirculation can also adapt to chronic
stresses. For example, exercise training
induces numerous adaptive changes that
may be responsible for a reduction in cor-
onary heart disease.41 Exercise leads to
increased blood flow capacity and transvas-
cular exchange capacity, possibly because of
remodeling of the coronary vascular bed and
alterations in vascular control. Exercise can
alter microvascular responses to mechanical
stimuli, such as stretch and flow, increase
NO synthase levels in the coronary micro-
vasculature and possibly alter coronary
vascular permeability regulation.41
Structural remodeling and angiogenesis are
important vascular regulatory mechanisms
in the coronary microcirculation,42 with
structural changes ultimately affecting
function.
It should be noted that the coronary
vascular system is also impacted by cardiac
contraction forces. The average coronary
per beat blood volume is not only dependent
on perfusion conditions, such as the level of
vasodilation and perfusion pressure, but it
also depends on changes due to cardiac
contraction and is lower in systole compared
with diastole. Because coronary inflow
occurs primarily in diastole, time-averaged
intramural blood volume lessens with
increasing heart rate (which causes shorten-
ing of diastole).40 The contraction process
dynamics include consequent variations in
compressive forces, coronary artery pressure
and intramural blood volume. Furthermore,
vessels are stretched and shortened during
the heart cycle, and the diameter of the
elastic vessels changes as a function of the
transmural pressure difference across the
vascular wall. This makes the coronary
vascular system very complex40 and analyses
of functional regulation of the microcircu-
lation more challenging.
Pathophysiologic mechanisms (schemat-
ically illustrated in Figure 2) possibly impli-
cated in coronary microvascular function
disorders include: 1. endothelial dysfunction
(reduced bioavailability of NO, increased
oxidative stress and increased endothelial
release of endothelin, thromboxane A2
and
prostaglandin H2
), 2. smooth muscle cell
dysfunction (primary impairment of smooth
muscle cell relaxation), 3. microvascular
spasm/sympathetic dysfunction (augmented
responses to a-adrenoceptor activation) and
4. altered microvascular remodelling.
Additional pathophysiological hypotheses
include vascular rarefaction, extramural
compression, vascular wall infiltration,
luminal obstruction, degraded endothelial
surface layer (for instance through damage
caused by reactive oxygen species, ischemia,
inflammation or altered plasma compos-
ition), compromised conduction of signals
along the vessel wall and impaired metabolic
feedback.37
Basic aspects of diabetic coronary
microvascular dysfunction
NO and arachidonic acid metabolites in
diabetic coronary microvascular
dysfunction
Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodila-
tation has been demonstrated in various
microvascular beds in animal models43 and
in the microcirculation of humans with
diabetes.44 Diabetes mellitus is associated
with coronary microvascular dysfunction,
attenuated vasodilation to various agonists
and reduced coronary venous pO2
.45
In humans with type 2 diabetes mellitus,
reduced NO production, increased reactive
oxygen species generation and enhanced
vasoconstrictor tone were related to
Kibel et al. 1907
impaired endothelium-dependent vasodila-
tion.46 Although baseline myogenic tone
and resting membrane potential of coronary
arterioles were not affected by diabetes
mellitus, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes
mellitus impair human coronary arteriolar
dilation to KATP
opening, leading to
reduced dilation to hypoxia.47 Several
models of genetically altered mice have
been utilized to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying altered endothelium-dependent
vasodilation of coronary microcirculation.
The majority of the studies pointed to a role
for reactive oxygen species and their inter-
action with vascular cell dilatory pathways.
For example, recovered acetylcholine-
stimulated coronary artery vasodilation,
increased manganese-dependent superoxide
dismutase expression and decreased nitro-
tyrosine levels in hearts have been observed
in diabetic db/db mice that were moderately
exercised. These observations suggest that
increased reactive oxygen species produc-
tion and nitrotyrosine levels in the heart are
associated with impaired endothelium-
dependent coronary artery vasodilation.48
Attenuated dilation to acetylcholine in type
2 diabetic Lepr(db) mice appears to occur
because of the interaction between Nuclear
factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and TNF-a signal-
ing, which induces inhibitor of nuclear
factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta
(IKK-b) activation and increases oxidative
stress.43 Similarly, in coronary microvessels
from diabetic dogs, bradykinin and acetyl-
choline caused lesser increases in NO pro-
duction than that in non-diabetic dogs.49

indicated coronary microvascular dysfunc-
tion, including impaired bradykinin-induced
vasodilatation because of NO loss and
reduced vasoconstriction to endothelin-1
because of decreased endothelin ETA
recep-
tor dominance.50
Although NO is the most important
vasodilatory metabolite in the coronary
circulation, NO loss or reduction has been
shown to be associated with increased activ-
ity of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing
factors, such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-
mediated production of vasoactive prosta-
glandins. This may present an adaptive
mechanism for reduction of the debilitating
effects of diabetes on coronary blood flow,
as demonstrated in human coronary arteri-
oles.45 However, impaired endothelium-
dependent dilation in diabetes might also
be related to the release of vasoconstrictor
mediators, such as increased 20-hydroxyei-
cosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) production.
This may lead to the activation of reactive
oxygen species through an NADPH-depen-
dent pathway,51 increased oxidative stress
and overexpression of both COX-1 and
COX-2,52 TXA2
-mediated contraction in
diabetic arteries53 and low-grade inflamma-
tion.45 Hyperglycaemia increases COX-2
expression,54 arachidonic acid release and
prostanoid production, all of which may
modify vasomotor tone.55
Peroxisome proliferator-activated recep-
tor-g, a regulator of lipid and glucose
metabolism, may play a role in diabetic
coronary microvascular dysfunction.3 It was
demonstrated that treatment of type 2 dia-
betic mice with rosiglitazone (peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-g activator)
increased NO-mediated flow-dependent
dilations of coronary arterioles by reducing
vascular superoxide production. These
changes were associated with a favorable
alteration of oxidant/antioxidant enzyme
activities.3
Diabetes upregulates cytochrome P450
(CYP) 4A isoforms and leads to elevated
20-HETE levels,56 while the 20-HETE
inhibitor HET0016 attenuates the develop-
ment of vascular dysfunction induced by
diabetes.57 In addition, recent findings sug-
gest that insulin-stimulated vasodilator
effects that are mediated by the insulin
receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/PI3K/Akt/
eNOS pathway are impaired by 20-
HETE.57 Elevated CYP-derived 20-HETE
levels in patients with diabetes and cardiac
ischemia are associated with dysfunction of
circulating endothelial progenitor cells and
angiogenic capacity.58 In a glucose intoler-
ance model, elevated soluble epoxide hydro-
lase expression might contribute to
endothelial dysfunction through increased
degradation of epoxeicosatrienoic acids.59
Data from a diabetic model reveal a differ-
ent mechanism, specifically a shift in the
balance between 20-HETE and epoxeicosa-
trienoic acid production caused by changes
in CYP4A3 and CYP2J4 expression.59­61
Reactive oxygen species and transient
receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1)
receptor­mediated responses
The toxic effect of a chronic hyperglycaemic
state, as in diabetes mellitus, is a well-known
generator of oxidative stress in all vascular
beds. A number of animal studies have
demonstrated deleterious effects of diabetes
mellitus related to a hyperoxidative status
on cardiac endothelial function.62­64 While
the role of different potassium channels in
vascular tone regulation in the coronary
vasculature is well known,62,65,66 the roles of
other pathways, including the TRPV1 recep-
tor-activated pathway, are under investiga-
tion. The TRPV1 protein is highly expressed
in canine coronary arteries.67
To elucidate whether TRPV1 expression
and/or function is altered by metabolic
syndrome, Bratz et al. used coronary arteries
from lean and obese Ossabaw miniature
swine. Capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, caused
dose-dependent relaxation, which was
Kibel et al. 1909
inhibited by capsazepine (a TRPV1 antag-
onist), endothelial denudation, potassium
channel inhibitors and NOS inhibition.
The capsaicin effect was blunted in pigs
with metabolic syndrome. TRPV1 expres-
sion and capsaicin-mediated divalent cation
influx was significantly higher in the lean
swine group. This observation suggests that
TRPV1 channels are functionally expressed
in the coronary circulation and mediate
endothelium-dependent vasodilation with
mechanisms that include NO and potassium
channels.68
In db/db diabetic mice, capsaicin-
mediated increased coronary blood flow
was attenuated, while control C57BKS/J
mice displayed an increased vasodilator
response in a capsaicin dose-dependent
manner. Mice lacking TRPV1 [TRPV1(-/-)]
did not display changes in coronary flow.
Capsazepine and the NOS inhibitor L-
NAME blocked the response in control
mice. In addition, pH changes (from pH
7.6 to pH 6.0) caused relaxation of previ-
ously contracted coronary arteries with a
thromboxane mimetic, but this effect was
significantly less in the TRPV1(-/-) and db/
db groups. The TRPV1 inhibitor SB366791
l-NAME and the large conductance cal-
cium-sensitive potassium channel inhibitor
iberiotoxin inhibited capsaicin-dependent
relaxation in pressurized coronary vascula-
ture. This observation indicates that TRPV1
couples metabolic needs of the myocardium
with coronary blood flow via large conduct-
ance calcium-sensitive potassium channels
and the NO pathway.69
DelloStritto et al.70 analyzed the role of
TRPV1 in coronary vascular reactivity in an
H2
O2
-regulated environment in a mouse
model of diabetes. The wild type C57BKS/
J (WT) mice responded with coronary blood
flow vasodilatation in an H2
O2
dose-depen-
dent manner, while this response was
blocked by the TRPV1 antagonist
SB366791. In TRPV1(-/-) and db/db dia-
betic mice, H2
O2
vasodilative responses
were significantly inhibited. WT, but not
db/db or TRPV1(-/-), mice displayed
TRPV1 agonist SB366791-sensitive dilation
in the presence of H2
O2
. Acute H2
O2
expos-
ure potentiated capsaicin-mediated vasodi-
lative responses in WT mice, while extended
H2
O2
exposure attenuated this effect.
Electrophysiological experiments that
included bovine aortic cells and isolated
mouse coronary endothelial cells con-
firmed the role of TRPV1 in coronary
microcirculation. Considering the results of
this study, it appears that prolonged H2
O2
exposure impairs TRPV1-dependent coron-
ary vascular signaling and can be related
to coronary endothelial dysfunction in
diabetes.
Based on these studies, it is apparent that
hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes,
which occur combined in metabolic syn-
drome, can underlie pathologic changes in
the coronary circulation.
Clinical aspects of coronary
microvascular changes in patients
with diabetes
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease with
rapidly increasing prevalence. Sedentary
lifestyle, ageing, overfeeding and obesity
lead to diabetes mellitus and result in over
80% of cardiovascular deaths among these
patients.71 Clinical and experimental studies
have demonstrated compromised cardiac
function as a result of altered myocardial
metabolism caused by diabetes, with a mis-
match of myocardial supply and demand.72
Cardiovascular consequences of diabetes are
atherosclerotic epicardial CAD and cardio-
myocyte and myocardium changes.
Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease, independent of age, hyper-
tension, obesity and hyperlipidemia.73 The
term diabetes-associated cardiovascular dys-
function includes a number of myocardial
changes, including functional, metabolic
and structural changes.74,75

Subclinical level of disease
The subclinical level of diabetes-induced
myocardial changes can be categorized as
atherosclerotic changes of epicardial coron-
ary arteries or microvascular coronary
endothelial dysfunction with cardiomyocyte
changes (schematically illustrated in
Figure 3). The endothelium is a central
regulator of vascular homeostasis. This
includes hormone transport and distribu-
tion, metabolic waste product disposal and
regulation of regional blood flow by synthe-
sis and release of different mediators with
opposing vascular properties (NO, prosta-
cyclin and endothelial-derived hyperpolariz-
ing factor are balanced by Endothelin 1 (ET-
1), angiotensin II and thromboxane A2
to
assure maintenance of nutrient and oxygen
delivery to tissues by controlling vascular
tone, vascular permeability and hemosta-
sis).76 The key pathophysiologic process of
diabetes-induced coronary microvascular
dysfunction is impaired coronary arteriole

vasomotion, including impaired endothelial-
mediated vasodilation, hypoxia-induced
vasodilation and myogenic response.72
Vasomotor dysfunction, affecting both
smooth muscle- and endothelium-mediated
mechanisms, is an early change, with long-
term structural changes and diabetic micro-
angiopathy development. Hyperglycaemia,
as a primary pathogenic mechanism
together with insulin resistance, hyperinsu-
linaemia, TNF-a overexpression and inflam-
mation, supresses flow-mediated
endothelial-dependent vasodilatation via
decreased NO levels and increased ET-1
levels, causing acute intracellular
changes.72,76,77
One of the primary physiological stimuli
involved in local regulation of arterial diam-
eter is intraluminal blood flow, predomin-
antly via NO endothelium-dependent
vasodilation. NO production and vasodila-
tion is reduced in diabetic animals and
patients with diabetes, with reduced
response to pharmacological and mechan-
ical stimuli.72,78 Structural changes in micro-
vessels are a sign of chronicity, manifested as
a thickened capillary basement membrane,
microaneurisms, spiral deformation, medial
arteriole thickening, perivascular fibrosis
and constriction, reduced vascular density
as a result of vascular endothelial cell
growth factor disturbances, reduced angio-
genesis and perivascular fibrosis.79­81
Additional mechanisms of diabetes-related
cardiomyocyte changes in contractility and
stiffness include: altered Ca2þ handling with
decreased myofilament function; increased
mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial react-
ive oxygen species formation and impaired
antioxidant defenses that contribute to oxi-
dative stress in type 1 and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (with increased DNA damage and
loss of activity DNA repair pathways pro-
moting abnormal cardiac remodeling and
cell death); decreased mitochondrial dys-
function as a result of functional and struc-
tural changes with reduced ATP production
and contractility; decreased glucose oxida-
tion and increased fatty acid oxidation;
increased lipotoxicity; accumulation of cer-
amides; increased renin-angiotensin-aldos-
terone system activation with oxidative
stress damage; endothelial/cardiomyocyte
cell apoptosis and necrosis; and myocardial
fibrosis, collagen formation, increased
thrombosis, decreased fibrinolysis and auto-
nomic dysfunction with sympathetic
overdrive.72,77,82­84
Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms
underlying endothelial physiology is crucial
for a better understanding of the patho-
physiology involved in endothelial dysfunc-
tion during diabetes. Diabetic endothelial
dysfunction involves a complex set of
changes that includes metabolic and func-
tional alterations, microvascular and neuro-
hormonal disturbances and autonomic
dysfunction. A better understanding of
these processes may help in the development
of novel approaches for early detection of
resulting cardiovascular complications and
eventual diabetic cardiomyopathy
(DMCMP).76,84
Coronary microvascular disease diagno-
sis requires the exclusion of abnormalities
and significant stenosis of major epicardial
vessels by coronary angiography. In patients
with suspected coronary microvascular dis-
ease, attempts should not be made to rely
on this exclusion, but rather to obtain
objective evidence of coronary microvascu-
lar disease.
Non-invasive diagnostic methods
Microvascular disease should be suspected
when chest pain persists after physical effort
and shows slow or no response to short-
acting nitrates.85,86 Transthoracic Doppler
echocardiography (TTDE) is an initial
screening method to detect significant
microcirculation impairment. It allows the
measurement of coronary blood flow (CBF)
velocity in the left anterior descending
1912 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
artery. With this method, coronary micro-
vascular dilatator function is calculated as
the ratio of diastolic CBF velocity at peak
vasodilatation to CBF velocity at rest.87 A
ratio < 2.0 in response to adenosine or
dipyridamole strongly suggests coronary
microvascular dysfunction. Mild coronary
microvascular dysfunction may not be iden-
tified by TTDE, and microvascular dysfunc-
tion can be assessed only in the left anterior
descending artery perfusion area, because
other coronary arteries are not well
visualized.87
Contrast stress echocardiography is pro-
mising for coronary microvascular disease
detection and may be used when TTDE
results are inconclusive or unreliable.87
Yag
 mur et al.88 demonstrated impaired lon-
gitudinal systolic strain on speckle tracking
echocardiography despite normal systolic
parameters. 2-D-speckle tracking echocardi-
ography is a feasible technique that allows
the evaluation of left ventricular regional
systolic function in patients with micro-
vascular dysfunction. This study contributed
to our understanding of the relationship
between fiber architecture, myocardial func-
tion and coronary microvascular disease.
Leung et al.89 demonstrated that left ven-
tricle contractile reserve with low dose
dobutamine echocardiography can be used
to non-invasively estimate the index of
microcirculatory resistance. Impaired con-
tractile reserve in this study indicated coron-
ary microvascular dysfunction.
Regional left ventricle myocardial perfu-
sion reserve (ratio between maximal hyper-
emic and basal myocardial blood flow) can
be estimated in patients with diabetes with
single photon technology, which is broadly
available. Myocardial blood flow index
can be determined from gated Single-
photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) images using 99 mTc-labelled
tracers by measuring first transit counts
in the pulmonary artery and myocardial
count rate.90
Coronary magnetic resonance imaging,
with a pharmacological stress test and gado-
linium as a flow tracer, is a relatively new
noninvasive method to detect microvascular
angina. Currently, this is still a complex,
expensive and time-consuming technique for
widespread utilization.91,92 Positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) allows measure-
ment of CBF per gram of myocardial
tissue and can be used to identify coronary
microvascular dysfunction.93 However, cor-
onary flow reserve (ratio of maximal hyper-
emic to basal CBF) may be preserved in mild
forms of coronary microvascular disease.
PET can also detect coronary vasomotor
abnormalities caused by microvascular dis-
ease.94,95 Recent studies suggest that 82Rb
PET/CT is emerging as an important as well
as rapid non-invasive assessment method of
microvascular function and structure in
asymptomatic patients with type 2 dia-
betes.96 Some authors consider PET as the
gold standard for myocardial flow reserve
measurements and myocardial viability
assessments.97
The objective documentation of myocar-
dial ischemia in patients with microvascular
dysfunction can be obtained with the use of
specific tests. For example, the assessment of
lipid peroxidation products in the coronary
sinus after stress tests represents a sensitive
method to detect myocardial ischemia in
patients with microvascular dysfunction.87
Unfortunately, this method is invasive and
cannot be proposed for routine application.
Coronary magnetic resonance spectroscopy
may detect phosphorus metabolism
abnormalities after a stress test,98 but this
method is very expensive and can only detect
anterior heart wall defects.
Invasive diagnostic methods
In patients with unstable microvascular
angina, a standard ECG record can detect
newly developing abnormalities, including
ST depression, T-wave inversion and
Kibel et al. 1913
elevation of cardio-sensitive markers, espe-
cially troponin. Unstable microvascular
angina diagnosis requires exclusion of cor-
onary spasm and coronary thrombosis.
Patients with coronary spasm typically
have chest pain after physical effort and
display ST elevation in an ECG.
Thrombosis is unlikely when there is no
evidence of atherosclerosis or coronary
abnormalities, but some conditions can be
associated with thrombus formation in ves-
sels without atherosclerosis.99 Coronary
microvascular disease diagnosis can be con-
firmed with vasoconstrictor agents, such as
ergonovine and acetylcholine, and should be
performed during coronary angiography.
An induction of angina and ST changes
without epicardial vasoconstriction would
be diagnostic for coronary microvascular
disease.
Coronary angiography allows us to assess
and analyze coronary microvascular function
with several different methods. Some of these
methods include thermodilution, the gas
washout method and intracoronary Doppler
wire flow. All of these methods allow CBF
and coronary flow reserve quantification.
Intravascular Doppler ultrasonography
(IVUS) allows us to visualize the state of
arterial walls and to detect atherosclerotic
plaques that cannot be adequately observed
on angiograms. IVUS is a method that is
primarily applied in the intracoronary rec-
ording of CBF using Doppler and pressure
wires and allows exact measurement of CBF
velocity. Using intracoronary Doppler and
pressure sensors we can determine the index
of microvascular resistance. This is defined as
the distal coronary pressure multiplied by the
exact transit time of reactive hyperemia.100
It should not be forgotten that a
``normal'' coronary angiogram does not
necessarily rule out an atherosclerotic
plaque. With IVUS we can detect non-
obstructive atherosclerotic plaques in cor-
onary arteries. Often in diffuse CAD, the
wall thickens outward without forming
notches in the lumen. In patients who have
diffuse epicardial artery disease but without
significant proximal stenosis, fractional flow
reserve analysis can be performed.
Fractional flow reserve is the ratio between
the distal coronary pressure and the aortic
pressure during maximal coronary vasodila-
tation. A value <0.8 is suggestive of hemo-
dynamically significant plaques that are
perhaps not yet obstructive. Thus, we can
avoid erroneously attributing patients'
symptoms to microvascular dysfunction.101
Coronary angiography allows indirect
evaluation of microvascular function by
measurement of angiographic indexes.
Myocardial blush is the myocardial opacifi-
cation that results from injection of dye into
the coronary circulation. We can determine
the myocardial blush grade by counting the
number of heart cycles required for the dye
to fade out, which depends on the microcir-
culatory resistance to contrast passage and
venous drainage efficiency.100,102 The total
myocardial blush score is the sum of the
myocardial blush grade of each coronary
territory and defines the overall microvascu-
lar functionality.102
The TIMI frame count (TFC) can be
calculated according to the number of
frames that are required for contrast to
reach the standardized distal coronary
artery landmark and using a correction
factor that depends on vessel length. TFC
is related to the velocity of the contrast
filling the epicardial vessel and the micro-
vascular district resistance index.103 TFC,
similar to total myocardial blush score,
represents the sum of three major epicardial
artery scores and is useful for coronary
microcirculation assessment.104
Studies linking diabetes to coronary
microvascular dysfunction
in human patients
There is a high prevalence of coronary
microvascular dysfunction in patients with
1914 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
type 2 diabetes who are free of overt
cardiovascular disease.96 Von Scholten
et al. measured coronary flow reserve with
cardiac 82Rb PET/computed tomography in
a cross-sectional study. Reduced coronary
flow reserve was significantly more common
in patients with diabetes, particularly those
with concomitant albuminuria, than in con-
trol subjects, suggesting that a common
microvascular impairment is occurring in
multiple microvascular beds. Di Carli and
coworkers measured myocardial blood flow
(using PET with N-13 ammonia as the flow
tracer) at rest during adenosine-induced
hyperaemia and in response to a cold pres-
sor test in healthy control subjects and
patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes
who were free of overt cardiovascular com-
plications. They confirmed markedly
reduced endothelium-dependent (adeno-
sine-induced hyperaemia) and -independent
(cold pressor test) coronary vasodilator
function in subjects with diabetes, which
were similarly reduced in both type 1 and
type 2 diabetes. The differences compared
with control subjects persisted after adjust-
ing for diabetes mellitus duration, insulin
treatment, metabolic abnormalities and
autonomic neuropathy. The data suggest
an important pathogenetic role of chronic
hyperglycaemia in diabetic vascular dys-
function.105 An impaired vasodilator
response of coronary resistance vessels to
increased sympathetic stimulation was asso-
ciated with diabetic autonomic neuropathy
and related to the degree of sympathetic
nerve dysfunction.106 Separate studies in
young patients with type 1 diabetes without
coronary heart disease suggested impair-
ment of coronary vascular reactivity, as
determined by PET and H2
O measurements
of myocardial blood flow at rest and after
dipyridamole administration.107 In patients
with type 2 diabetes, similar measurements
(but using PET and N-13 ammonia)
revealed reduced myocardial flow reserve.108
Myocardial blood flow at rest was
comparable between healthy controls and
patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas myo-
cardial blood flow after dipyridamole
administration was significantly lower in
patients with diabetes.108 Moreover, myo-
cardial flow reserve was inversely correlated
with average haemoglobin A1C for 5 years
and fasting plasma glucose levels, implying
that glycaemic control is related to coronary
microvascular function.108 In patients with
type 2 diabetes, application of the SPECT
method also documented the presence of
microvascular dysfunction, which was
homogeneously distributed throughout the
walls of the left ventricle and most fre-
quently not associated with reversible per-
fusion defects.90 Invasive studies in patients
with diabetes with angiographically normal
coronary arteries and normal left ventricular
systolic function demonstrated impaired
coronary vascular reserve (measured by
intracoronary Doppler with an intracoron-
ary maximally vasodilating dose of papa-
verine) and acetylcholine-induced coronary
vasodilation.109 These coronary microcircu-
latory alterations in diabetes may contribute
to progressive myocardial deterioration and
DMCMP pathogenesis.109
DMCMP
DMCMP is a multifactorial disease and a
result of complex pathophysiologic pro-
cesses.74 The impact of diabetes on athero-
sclerotic vascular disease has been well
established, but non-ischemic heart failure
in patients with diabetes has received less
attention.81 DMCMP is defined as struc-
tural and functional abnormalities of the
myocardium in patients with diabetes who
have no coronary disease or
hypertension.110
From a histological perspective,
DMCMP is characterised by the loss of
normal microvessels, extracellular matrix
remodelling, capillary basement membrane
thickening, interstitial and perivascular
Kibel et al. 1915
fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy inde-
pendent of hypertension and cardiomyocyte
atrophy.81,111 The Strong Heart Study
reported that both men and women with
type 2 diabetes mellitus have increased left
ventricle mass and wall thickness,112 because
hyperinsulinaemia as a result of insulin
resistance can act as a growth factor.75
Obesity is an additional risk factor in type
2 diabetes mellitus, where increased intra-
myocardial lipid levels act as lipotoxic
deposits that can contribute to cell death
via as of yet unexplained mechanisms and,
from a clinical point of view, lead to dia-
stolic dysfunction.113,114
After myocardial infarction, the diabetic
myocardium possesses reduced compensa-
tory mechanisms to restore cardiac function
because of a complex set of intra- and extra-
myocardial factors.115 From a clinical per-
spective, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus
differ in aetiology, clinical presentation and
metabolic profiles with adverse clinical pres-
entation. However, the two types share
many features of cardiomyopathy.81
Systolic dysfunction is usually predominant
in type 1 diabetes, where autoimmunity
predisposes to a dilative phenotype and
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction,
or is related to atherosclerotic coronary and
chronic ischemic heart diseases.116 Coronary
microvascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes
is predominantly the result of hypergly-
caemia, lipotoxicity and hyperinsulinaemia.
This occurs independently or in combin-
ation with other risk factors and leads
primarily to diastolic dysfunction, concen-
tric left ventricle remodelling and clinical
presentation of heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction. Furthermore, there is a
progressive problem manifesting in myocar-
dial stiffness (impaired relaxation and pas-
sive filling) and restrictive pattern
development, with or without subclinical
levels of depressed left ventricle systolic
function.71,116­118 Both types of diabetes
have the same myocardial results, including
coronary microvascular rarefaction and
advanced glycation end-product
depositions.116
DMCMP is highly prevalent in asymp-
tomatic patients with type 2 diabetes.
Screening and early detection of myocardial
changes may be crucial for slowing heart
failure development and progression. Thus,
early determination of myocardial manifest-
ations can have major implications for
prognosis in patients with diabetes. The
most sensitive test for cardiac systolic and
diastolic function is transthoracic echocar-
diography.119 Schwanell and coworkers
demonstrated that diastolic left ventricular
dysfunction is a first sign of myocardial
changes even in younger patients with
normal systolic function detected by trans-
thoracic echocardiography.120 Poirer and
coworkers confirmed this finding in male
patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes.
The authors used the Valsava manoeuvre
and pulmonary venous recordings, together
with a standard echocardiographic transmi-
tral left ventricular filling pattern of abnor-
mal relaxation and/or pseudonormal filling,
to unmask pseudonormal patterns of ven-
tricular filling.121 Tissue Doppler imaging,
which can measure myocardial tissue velo-
cities in the longitudinal direction, is more
sensitive for the detection of left ventricular
dysfunction. The peak early diastolic myo-
cardial velocity reflects global left ventricu-
lar diastolic dysfunction.81 Additional
echocardiographic tools include strain echo-
cardiography, in which measurement of
global longitudinal strain can detect myo-
cardial abnormalities before left ventricular
ejection fraction declines.122
Prognosis
A clear strategy for prevention or treatment
of diabetes-induced/related cardiomyopathy
and, consequently, a prognosis have not yet
been established.81 The increasing number
of both basic research and clinical studies,
1916 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
particularly those that develop novel ima-
ging techniques, are promising for detection
of early microvascular functional changes
and early changes in the myocardium in
diabetes. Interestingly, there is evidence that
patients with diabetes with a preserved
coronary flow reserve have cardiac event
rates similar to those of non-diabetic
patients.\123 Additionally, among diabetic
patients without evident CAD, individuals
with impaired coronary flow reserve (below
the median) have mortality rates compar-
able to non-diabetic patients with prior
CAD (cardiac death rate 2.8 vs. 2.0% per
year).123 This strongly implies that it is
crucial to focus on the development and
utilization of therapeutic strategies that will
preserve normal coronary microvascular
function in patients with diabetes.
Cortigani et al.124 demonstrated that coron-
ary microvascular dysfunction before the
occurrence of coronary artery involvement
is an independent and strong predictor of
adverse outcomes in patients with type 2
diabetes. They investigated Doppler-derived
coronary flow velocity reserve of the left
anterior descending coronary artery in 144
patients with type 2 diabetes who had chest
pain or angina-like symptoms, with pre-
served left ventricular systolic function and
without flow-limiting stenoses on angiog-
raphy. During 29 months of follow-up, 17
hard events (five deaths and twelve nonfatal
myocardial infarctions) occurred, with a
13.9% annual hard-event rate in patients
with a reduced coronary flow velocity
reserve and 2.0% in patients with a higher
coronary flow velocity reserve. This finding
illustrated the adverse effect of microvascu-
lar dysfunction on prognosis, while nonob-
structive CAD was not an independent
predictor.124 Impaired coronary micro-
vascular function was also implicated in a
poor prognosis in the setting of acute myo-
cardial infarction, where patients with dia-
betes have higher mortality rates.125 The
lack of microvascular reperfusion following
revascularization in patients with diabetes
with myocardial infarction appears to be
one mechanism underlying a poor clinical
outcome with major adverse cardiac events
(death, reinfarction and congestive heart
failure) that occurs more frequently in
patients with a lack of microvascular reper-
fusion (30.8% vs. 15.9%).126
Early detection of diastolic dysfunction in
young patients with diabetes is also useful
for detecting increased arrhythmia risk.120
Subclinical levels of left ventricular dysfunc-
tion, detected by strain echo and global
longitudinal strain, is another important
parameter in asymptomatic patients with
diabetes, because it is associated with
adverse outcomes122 and correlated with cor-
onary microvascular dysfunction.127 A
DMCMP diagnosis requires impaired glu-
cose metabolism as well as the exclusion of
coronary, congenital, familial, infiltrative,
viral, valvular and hypertensive heart dis-
ease.116 It should be clarified that heart
failure in patients with diabetes is not
simply an advanced stage of DMCMP but
results from a constellation of pathophysio-
logic processes.128 Many unanswered ques-
tions need to be resolved, such as the issue of
pathophysiologic and clinical differences
between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus
and the lack of any pathognomonic histo-
logic changes or imaging characteristics
associated with the diagnosis.128
Additionally, explanations of clinical mani-
festations of diabetes with respect to ath-
erosclerotic coronary disease development
or diabetic coronary microangiopathy/car-
diomyopathy development are required.
The big challenge in DMCMP diagnosis is
how to exclude hypertension/hypertensive
heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes
and metabolic syndrome.
Patients with comorbid heart failure and
diabetes mellitus represent a growing patient
population. Future clinical studies in both
heart failure and diabetes are encouraged to
refocus and differentially investigate the
Kibel et al. 1917
efficacy, safety and outcomes in patients
with heart failure and concomitant diabetes
mellitus.84
Treatment options
There is a little research evaluating treat-
ment options in patients with microvascular
dysfunction. All patients should achieve
optimal coronary risk factor control.
Treatment options are empirical and arise
from the experiences obtained from treat-
ment of ``classical'' CAD.
Angiotensin is a potent vasoconstrictor.
Inhibition of its action, by angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or angio-
tensin receptor 1 (AT1
) receptor blockade,
counteracts its influence and promotes vessel
dilation. Pauly et al.129, in their study
investigating quinapril in women with chest
pain without obstructive coronary disease
and reduced coronary flow reserve <2.5,
identified significant changes in coronary
flow reserve measured by intra IC Doppler.
Other authors found similar results in their
studies, demonstrating improved stress test
parameters and coronary flow reserve.130,131
Combination of eplerenone with angiotensin
II inhibition did not improve endothelial
dysfunction in a study by Bavry on women
with signs and symptoms of ischemia in the
setting of nonobstructive CAD.132 However,
investigation of microvascular dysfunction in
patients with diabetes revealed that mineralo-
corticoid receptors might indeed be an
appealing target to treat microvascular cor-
onary dysfunction in diabetes.133 It was
demonstrated that interruption of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system with the use
of ACE inhibitors improved coronary flow
reserve (measured by quantitative PET) in
patients with diabetes without ischemic heart
disease. This effect was further enhanced by
spironolactone.133,134
Calcium channel blockade decreases
microvascular spasm and tone, potentially
improving coronary flow reserve in patients
with coronary microvascular dysfunc-
tion.135 Verapamil, nifedipine and lidofla-
zine have been demonstrated to improve
exercise stress parameters.136,137 Su
¨ tsch and
colleagues did not determine that diltiazem
improves coronary flow reserve.138
Statins have anti-inflammatory and anti-
atherogenic effects. Zhang et al.139 demon-
strated an improvement in coronary flow
reserve and symptoms following fluvastatin
treatment. Eshtehardi et al.140 revealed
improved coronary flow reserve in patients
treated with atorvastatin. Additionally,
some studies have indicated that an inability
to reach target cholesterol values with statin
therapy is associated with impaired coron-
ary flow reserve and a worse prognosis.141
NO is a crucial player in endothelium-
dependent mediation of coronary microvas-
culature tone.142 In one study, the authors
evaluated the role of sildenafil in symptom-
atic patients with coronary flow reserve <2.5
compared with patients with coronary flow
reserve >2.5. Patients with reduced coron-
ary flow reserve displayed a significant
increase in coronary flow reserve.143
Considering the fact that L-arginine is a
precursor of NO, Bottcher et al.101 analysed
a one-time infusion of L-arginine in 25
patients with chest pain without obstructive
CAD or coronary microvascular dysfunc-
tion by PET. They noted no improvement in
symptoms after infusion. In contrast,
Egashira and Gellman noticed improved
coronary flow reserve after a single L-
arginine infusion.144,145 However, Lerman
identified improved symptoms but no
change in coronary flow reserve after
6 months of supplementation.146
Alpha-blockers reduce sympathetic activity
and can thus potentially decrease microvascu-
lar tone. Botker, in his double-blind, placebo-
controlled, crossover study, did not observe a
change in exercise duration, time to angina
onset or exercise time to> 0.1 mV ST segment
depression between patients administered
doxazosin and those receiving a placebo.147
1918 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
It has been theorized that an oestrogen
deficiency could play a role in microvascular
dysfunction. Bairey Merz et al.148 demon-
strated an improvement in anginal symp-
toms but without improvements in
myocardial ischemia or brachial artery
flow-mediated dilatation. In contrast,
Knuuti et al.149 revealed improved aver-
age myocardial perfusion reserve after oes-
trogen use.
Spinal cord stimulation modulates
pain-related nerve signals and increases
myocardial blood flow. Jessurun et al.150
demonstrated an improvement in symptoms
after the use of transcutaneous spinal cord
stimulator therapy. Some other studies
revealed similar results with angina symp-
tom relief as well as improved coronary flow
reserve.151
Beta-blockers are the gold standard for
the treatment of stable angina and CAD.
They reduce myocardial oxygen demand
and increase diastolic perfusion. However,
there do not appear to be any studies
investigating beta-blocker treatment in
patients with diabetic microvascular dys-
function.152 The first and second generation
of beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol,
metoprolol and bisoprolol) reduce coronary
flow at rest, but their action on hyperaemic
coronary flow is controversial and variable.
Third generation beta-blockers (carvedilol
and nebivolol) have vasodilatatory effects
through NO synthesis and alpha-adrenergic
receptor blockade, ameliorating maximal
hyperaemia of CBF.153
Fukomoto and coworkers investigated
the effect of the rho-kinase inhibitor, fasudil.
Intracoronary fasudil (300 mg) administra-
tion reduced coronary sinus lactate produc-
tion and improved myocardial ischemia
parameters (ST segment changes and
angina symptoms).152
There are several types of antianginal
drugs (ivabradine, ranolazine, mibefradil,
nicorandil and trimetazidine) that have
been investigated in patients with
microvascular dysfunction. These drugs
work through several different mechanisms
to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and
ischemia. Ranolazine has been extensively
studied and was confirmed to improve
myocardial perfusion reserve, as well as
other symptomatic and stress test met-
rics.155,156 Several studies have examined
the role of nitrates in chest pain without
obstructive CAD and have found no bene-
fits. Russo et al.157 observed no significant
changes in stress test parameters following
isosorbide dinitrate use, and some authors
have observed worsened angina and reduced
CBF with rapid atrial pacing.158
Teophilline, an adenosine receptor
blocker, was assessed in several small
studies. The majority of these reports
demonstrated improved exercise cap-
acity.152 Six-week exercise training versus a
low cholesterol diet and relaxation tech-
niques were also analysed. An improvement
in coronary flow reserve in the exercise
group was observed.159 Some psychiatric
therapy, such as the tricyclic antidepressant
imipramine, can also improve symptoms.
Selective intracoronary endothelin A-
receptor blockade (with the selective blocker
BQ123) reversed the coronary microvascu-
lar dysfunction that is present during cor-
onary stenting in patients with type 2
diabetes. Thus, therapeutic targeting of the
endothelin system might be useful in pro-
tecting the myocardium against ischemic
events during elective percutaneous coron-
ary intervention in patients with diabetes.160
Jadhav et al. compared metformin treat-
ment (500 mg twice a day; n ¼ 16) with
placebo administration (n ¼ 17) in women
with normal results from a coronary angio-
gram, with two consecutive positive ergo-
metry tests (positive defined as ST-segment
depression ! 1 mm). Metformin treatment
was associated with a significant reduction
in weight and in homeostatic model assess-
ment of insulin resistance.161 Metformin
treatment also improved the microvascular

There is no consensus or specific clinical guidelines for diabetic coronary microvascular dysfunction, because
studies are limited and known information is scarce. Therapeutic strategies can, at this point, be based on
preventive measures, treatment of diabetes (although intensive glycaemic control has not been proven to
improve coronary microvascular dysfunction, it is important for preventing diabetic complications) and
treatment of microvascular angina and/or cardiomyopathy/heart failure. Early detection/diagnosis and
monitoring of disease progression are advisable and can contribute to timely initiation of therapeutic

endothelial-dependent response to acetyl-
choline using laser Doppler devices, while a
positive response was absent in the placebo
group. Maximum ischemic ST denivelation,
Duke score and reduced chest pain were also
present in the metformin-treated group
compared with those receiving the pla-
cebo.161 Metformin has been demonstrated
to have direct vascular effects. Treatment
improves vascular function and dramatic-
ally reduces cardiovascular end points and
mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus in large-scale clinical trials, but with
incompletely elucidated mechanisms.
Recently, it was determined that metformin
treatment leads to increased NO production,
which is induced by AMP protein kinase
activation.162
However, it is inconclusive whether gly-
caemic control can contribute to prevention
or reversal of diabetic coronary microvascu-
lar dysfunction. Valenzuela-Garcia et al.
analysed 100 patients with type 2 diabetes
and 214 patients without diabetes and
observed a lack of correlation between
optimal glycaemic control and coronary
microvascular dysfunction.163
Furthermore, more intensive glycaemic con-
trol in patients with type 2 diabetes did not
reduce the occurrence of heart failure.164
A proposed diagnostic-therapeutic algo-
rithm, based on the information provided
earlier, is displayed in Figure 4. The first steps
are widely known preventive measures for
type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetic coron-
ary microvascular dysfunction should min-
imize risk factors. It is recommended that all
patients receive secondary prevention ther-
apy, including aspirin and statins. Beta-
blockers are recommended as a first-line
therapy, and calcium channel blockers are
recommended if beta-blockers do not achieve
sufficient symptom control or are not toler-
ated. Other therapy options have lower level
of recommendation. In patients with micro-
vascular angina, the therapeutic response is
highly variable and challenging, even without
concomitant diabetes mellitus. Treatment
often requires a combination of medications
to control symptoms. There is still a lack of
research evaluating therapies to relieve
angina symptoms and reduce risk in popula-
tions suffering from microvascular dysfunc-
tion and, in particular, effective therapies
targeting coronary microvascular dysfunc-
tion in diabetes. Future research should be
focused on symptom improvement, improve-
ment in quality of life and on the use of drugs
that act directly on the pathophysiological
processes.
Conclusion
The coronary microcirculation is a tightly
regulated network, with several interrelated
physiological processes acting to match
myocardial perfusion to metabolic
demands. Dysfunction of this important
system occurs in the context of diabetes
mellitus, as a result of complex metabolic
disorders and pathophysiological mechan-
isms, as determined in animal models and
in human diabetic patients using non-inva-
sive and invasive diagnostic and research
procedures. A reduced coronary flow
reserve, consequent to a number of dam-
ages to normal endothelium-dependent and
endothelium-independent vasomotion, in
response to metabolic, hemodynamic,
neural, hormonal and other stimuli, is a
hallmark of diabetes-induced microvascular
dysfunction. Failure of a normally func-
tioning microvasculature, which precedes
morphological changes, significantly
increases mortality. It ultimately culminates
in the development of DMCMP and asso-
ciated consequences. Unfortunately, our
present therapeutic strategies for treatment
of coronary microvascular dysfunction
induced by diabetes are very limited.
Additional research in this area will provide
us with more effective treatment approaches
and thereby lead to improved care of
patients with diabetes.
