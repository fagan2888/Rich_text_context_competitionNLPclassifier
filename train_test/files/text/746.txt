Diabetes is one of the most common
chronic diseases in the U.S., having a
prevalence of 7.5% among people
aged 20 years (1). Diabetes prevalence
rates vary widely in different regions of the
world. In some traditional communities,
such as those of the Mapuche Indians and
Melanesians, diabetes is rare or absent,
whereas high prevalence rates are observed
in some Arab, Asian Indian, Chinese, and
Hispanic American populations (2). In the
U.S., diabetes is more common in African-
Americans, Mexican Americans, Japanese
Americans, and Native Americans than in
non-Hispanic Caucasians (1).
Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95% of all
diabetes. Although both insulin resistance
and -cell dysfunction are well docu-
mented, the molecular basis of type 2 dia-
betes is poorly understood (3,4). It has
long been considered a disorder resulting
from both genetic and nongenetic influ-
ences (5). The current understanding of the
genetic basis of diabetes is largely restricted
to a few distinct monogenic forms of the
disease with clear Mendelian modes of
inheritance (3,4); there has been limited
progress in identifying specific genetic
defects responsible for the most common
form(s) of type 2 diabetes, which is likely to
be heterogeneous and polygenic.
The Amish Family Diabetes Study was
initiated in 1995 with the goal of identify-
ing the genetic determinants of type 2 dia-
betes and related traits through positional
cloning approaches. The Amish, named
after their original leader Jacob Ammann,
immigrated from western Europe (mainly
Switzerland) to the U.S. to escape religious
persecution over a 50-year period begin-
ning in 1727 (6). The earliest immigrants
settled in Pennsylvania. Later groups settled
in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. There are no
longer any Amish living in Europe.
Approximately 200 of these families settled
in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and can
be considered the founders of today's Lan-
caster Amish community (7). Today's
Amish population in the Lancaster area
exceeds 30,000 (8).
All Amish are ruralites, and most earn
their living by farming. They are resistant to

Diabetes in the Old Order Amish
Characterization and heritability analysis of the Amish Family
Diabetes Study
O R I G I N A L A R T I C L E
OBJECTIVE -- The Old Order Amish (OOA) are a genetically well-defined closed Caucasian
founder population. The Amish Family Diabetes Study was initiated to identify susceptibility
genes for type 2 diabetes. This article describes the genetic epidemiology of type 2 diabetes and
related traits in this unique population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The study cohort comprised Amish
probands with diabetes who were diagnosed between 35 and 65 years of age and their
extended adult family members. We recruited 953 adults who represented 45 multigenerational
families. Phenotypic characterization included anthropometry, blood pressure, diabetes status,
lipid profile, and leptin levels.
RESULTS -- The mean age of study participants was 46 years, and the mean BMI was 26.9
kg/m2. Subjects with type 2 diabetes were older, more obese, and had higher insulin levels. The
prevalence of diabetes in the OOA was approximately half that of the Caucasian individuals who
participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (95% CI 0.23­0.84).
The prevalence of diabetes in the siblings of the diabetic probands was 26.5% compared with a
prevalence of 7.0% in spouses (
s
= 3.28, 95% CI 1.58­6.80). The heritability of diabetes-related
quantitative traits was substantial (13­70% for obesity-related traits, 10­42% for glucose levels,
and 11­24% for insulin levels during the oral glucose tolerance test; P = 0.01 to 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS -- Type 2 diabetes in the Amish has similar phenotypic features to that of
the overall Caucasian population, although the prevalence in the Amish community is lower
than that of the Caucasian population. There is significant familial clustering of type 2 diabetes
and related traits. This unique family collection will be an excellent resource for investigating
the genetic underpinnings of type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes in the Amish
assimilation into the surrounding dominant
culture and are widely known for their old-
fashioned social and technological practices
and characteristic dress. They do not pros-
elytize and do not allow outsiders to marry
into the sect. They represent both a religious
and a genetic isolate (6). There is a high
degree of consanguinity in the Old Order
Amish (OOA). Although first-cousin mar-
riages are not permitted, on average, OOA
married couples are more closely related
than second cousins once removed but less
related than second cousins (9). Other fea-
tures of this population include low reloca-
tion rates, a relatively high standard of
living, large family sizes (average sibship
size 6­7), and essentially complete genealo-
gies dating back to the early 1700s (12­14
generations). All of these characteristics
facilitate the collection of large families and
extended pedigrees for genetic studies.
In this initial report, we describe the
design of the Amish Family Diabetes Study,
the genetic epidemiology of diabetes, and
the heritability of diabetes-related traits in
this unique founder population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study recruitment
Subject recruitment for the Amish Family
Diabetes Study began in February 1995.
The protocol was approved by the Institu-
tional Review Board of the University of
Maryland. Informed consent, including
permission to contact relatives, was
obtained before participation. Individuals
with adult-onset diabetes were identified
by door-to-door interviews and by word-
of-mouth. Probands were defined as indi-
viduals with previously diagnosed diabetes
with age at diagnosis between 35 and 65
years. The diabetic probands' first- and sec-
ond-degree family members aged 18
years were recruited. If another diabetic
individual was identified in the family (e.g.,
an aunt or uncle), then the family was
expanded further to include that person's
first- and second-degree relatives aged 18
years. The efficiency of this type of sequen-
tial sampling strategy for genetic linkage
studies has been previously described (10).
Phenotypic characterization
Study subjects were examined either at the
Amish Diabetes Research Clinic in Stras-
burg, Pennsylvania, or at their homes.
Height and weight were measured using a
stadiometer and calibrated scale with shoes
removed and in light clothing. Waist cir-
cumference was measured at the level of
the umbilicus, and hip circumference was
measured at the widest protuberance across
the pelvis. Skinfold thickness was mea-
sured with calipers in triplicate at 2 sites,
the subscapular and triceps. The ratios of
waist-to-hip circumference (WHR) and
subscapular-to-triceps skinfold thickness
(STR) were calculated as indexes of abdom-
inal and central adipose distributions. Sys-
tolic (first phase) and diastolic (fifth phase)
blood pressure were obtained in duplicate
by use of a standard sphygmomanometer
with the subject sitting for at least 5 min
and was recorded to the nearest 1 mmHg.
After an overnight fast, an indwelling
angiocatheter was placed in an antecubital
vein. After acquisition of a fasting blood
sample, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT) was administered. Blood samples
were then drawn for determination of glu-
cose and insulin values at 30-min intervals
for 3 h during the OGTT. Glucose concen-
trations were assayed with a Beckman glu-
cose analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
CA) using the glucose oxidase method
(interassay coefficient of variation = 1.52%)
(11). Insulin and leptin levels were deter-
mined by radioimmunoassay (Linco, St.
Louis, MO) (interassay coefficients of varia-
tion = 4.42 and 4.25%, respectively). The
total glucose and insulin areas under the
curve (AUCs) during the 3-h OGTT were
determined with the trapezoid method.
HbA
1c
levels were measured by high-
pressure liquid chromatography (interassay
coefficient of variation = 4.3% for low stan-
dard and 2.5% for high standard), and the
fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, and triglyceride levels) was
assayed by Quest Diagnostics (Baltimore,
MD) (interassay coefficient of variation =
1.6% for total cholesterol, 5.0% for HDL
cholesterol, and 1.6% for triglycerides).
Levels of antibodies to GAD, a marker of
immune destruction of pancreatic -cells,
were measured by radioligand-binding
assay (12) in a subset of 455 subjects (48
subjects with diabetes).
Previously known diabetes was deter-
mined by a self-report of diabetes and any
of the following: 1) a single fasting venous
plasma glucose level 7 mmol/l or a 2-h
OGTT venous plasma glucose level 11.1
mmol/l; 2) current treatment with insulin
or oral hypoglycemic agents; or 3) con-
firmed diagnosis by a physician. Newly
defined diabetes was determined by the
lack of diabetes history by self-report and
positive OGTT results (either a fasting
venous plasma glucose level 7 mmol/l or
a 2-h OGTT venous plasma glucose level
11.1 mmol/l). Impaired glucose toler-
ance (IGT) was defined as a 2-h OGTT
venous plasma glucose level 7.8 mmol/l
but 11.1 mmol/l, and impaired fasting
glucose (IFG) was defined as a fasting
plasma glucose level 6.1 mmol/l but 7
mmol/l. The definitions of IGT and IFG
excluded subjects with diabetes.
Statistical methods
To obtain descriptive details of the collec-
tion, clinical characteristics of study sub-
jects were computed as unadjusted means
± SD. Means were compared using analysis
of variance (ANOVA) (SYSTAT 8.0; SPSS,
Chicago); P values were adjusted for age
and sex, and, where appropriate, BMI. To
obtain unbiased estimates of the prevalence
of diabetes and IGT in the overall OOA
population, we compared age-specific
prevalence rates in spouses of OOA dia-
betic probands and their family members.
We compared diabetes and IGT prevalence
in the OOA with corresponding rates from
the general U.S. Caucasian population, as
estimated from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) (1). Using the indirect
method of age adjustment (13), we applied
prevalence rates obtained from the
NHANES III to determine the expected
number of diabetes cases in the OOA.
Direct comparisons of diabetes prevalence
between OOA and the NHANES III were
then obtained by comparing the number of
cases observed in the OOA with the num-
ber expected if the OOA had the same age-
specific prevalence rates as the NHANES
III. The confidence interval for the ratio of
observed-to-expected was also calculated
(13). The 
s
was estimated by comparing
the prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes
between siblings of diabetic probands and
spouses of OOA diabetic probands and
their family members, adjusting for age
with the Mantel-Haenszel procedure (14).
The heritabilities of diabetes- and obe-
sity-related traits were computed using
standard quantitative genetic methods (15).
Heritability was defined in the narrow sense
as the proportion of total phenotypic vari-
ance that could be attributed to the additive
effects of genes. It was estimated as a func-
tion of the covariance among all possible
relationship pairs in the pedigree. We simul-
taneously adjusted for the effects of age,
age2, and sex. Parameter estimates were
obtained using maximal likelihood proce-
dures, as implemented in the SOLAR soft-
ware package (Southwest Foundation for
Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX)
(16). Although it is possible to combine all
of the study participants into a single 11-
generation pedigree (17), it was not com-
putationally feasible to perform heritability
analysis with such a complex pedigree
structure. Therefore, we combined families
with overlapping individuals so that the
original 45 families were reduced to 8 pedi-
grees ranging in size from 3 to 844 individ-
uals. Subjects with unknown diabetes status
due to missing data (n = 25) were excluded
from all analyses, and subjects with diabetes
(n = 109) were excluded from heritability
analysis of insulin. Similarly, subjects cur-
rently taking antihypertensive medications
were excluded from heritability analysis of
blood pressure. Data on HbA
1c
, insulin, lep-
tin, and triglycerides were transformed by
their natural logarithms to normalize the
data distributions.
RESULTS -- The Amish Family Dia-
betes Study was well received by the OOA
community, and the participation rate was
excellent (80%). Of those who did not
participate, the most common reasons
given were 1) lived over 60 miles from the
clinic, 2) personal reasons, and 3) debili-
tating illnesses that precluded their partic-
ipation. By the end of March 1998, 953
adults aged 18 years from 45 multigen-
erational families were studied. The mean
sibship size was 4.5 (range 1­16). The 8
extended pedigrees formed by combining
these 45 families provided a very large
number of relationship pairs for our genetic
analyses (Table 1).
Overall, 53% of the study subjects were
women. The overall frequency of diabetes in
this study population ascertained through a
diabetic proband was 11.7%. Diabetes was
significantly more common in women
(13.5%) than men (9.7%) (P = 0.02),
although after removing probands from the
sample, the prevalence in men and women
was approximately similar (10.5% in
women, 7.3% in men, P = 0.1). Clinical
characteristics of OOA subjects with dia-
betes and IGT and/or IFG were similar to
those observed in other Caucasian popula-
tions (Table 2) (18,19). Compared with
euglycemic subjects, those with diabetes or
IGT and/or IFG were older, more obese,
and had higher blood pressure and triglyc-
eride levels. Amish individuals with diabetes
and impaired glucose tolerance also had
higher insulin levels than euglycemic indi-
viduals, suggesting insulin resistance.
Table 3 compares the age-specific
prevalence rates of diabetes and IGT
between spouses of OOA diabetic
probands and their family members and
Caucasians from NHANES III (1). For the
sake of comparison, diabetes status was
defined by World Health Organization cri-
teria (20) for both the OOA and NHANES
III. As in NHANES III Caucasians, the
prevalence of diabetes increased with age in
the OOA. Diabetes prevalence was lower in
the OOA across all age groups than in the
general U.S. Caucasian population. The
overall prevalence of diabetes in the OOA
was 5.0% (14 of 280 subjects). A total of
22.4 cases would be expected among sub-
jects aged 40­74 years if the OOA experi-
enced the same prevalence rates as the
NHANES III. Thus, the diabetes prevalence
in the OOA was only 0.54 times that of the
national rate for U.S. Caucasians (95% CI
0.23­0.84). In contrast, the prevalence of
IGT in the OOA was 1.38 times that of
NHANES III Caucasians (95% CI
0.93­1.83). The mean BMI in all of the age
groups was comparable with those of
NHANES III (data not shown) (21).
Diabetes was diagnosed in a total of
109 OOA individuals. Characteristics of
these diabetic subjects are summarized in
Table 4. Of those individuals, 57% were
newly diagnosed at our research clinic.

More than half of all previously known
cases were on insulin (53.2%), whereas
only 6.4% of previously known cases did
not take any medications for diabetes.
The prevalence of GAD antibody pos-
itivity in diabetic subjects whose age at
diagnosis was 35 years was 10.0%. This
rate did not differ significantly from that in
subjects with either normal glucose toler-
ance (6.6%) or IGT (5.6%). In contrast, the
prevalence of GAD antibody positivity was
50% in diabetic subjects with an age at
diagnosis 35 years, which is significantly
higher than that in nondiabetic subjects
(P  0.001). These results are in accor-
dance with the hypothesis that a large pro-
portion of diabetes cases with an age at
diagnosis 35 years may have autoim-
mune type 1 diabetes or latent autoim-
mune diabetes of adults (LADA) (22), and,
therefore, we excluded subjects with age of
diagnosis 35 years (n = 17) from further
analyses of type 2 diabetes­related traits.
To determine the magnitude of familial
aggregation of type 2 diabetes in the OOA,
we compared prevalence rates of diabetes
(age at diagnosis 35 years) between sib-
lings of diabetic probands and the spouses
of probands and their family members. The
prevalence of type 2 diabetes was signifi-
cantly higher in the probands' siblings aged
35 years (9 of 34 [26.5%]) than in the
spouse group (13 of 187 [7.0%]). The sib-
ling relative risk (
s
) adjusted for age by the
Mantel-Haenszel procedure was 3.28 (95%
CI 1.58­6.80). In contrast, the prevalence
of IGT was similar between the 2 groups
(23.5% among diabetic probands' siblings
vs. 20.9% in the spouse group).
Heritability estimates for obesity, blood
pressure, lipids, HbA
1c
, glucose, and
insulin in the Amish Family Diabetes Study
are shown in Table 5. Heritability of both
BMI and leptin was 42%. Heritability of the
body composition measures were 37% for
waist circumference, 13% for WHR, and
70% for STR (P  0.001 for all). Concen-
trations of lipids were also highly heritable,
with familiality accounting for 35, 50, and
54% of variation in triglycerides, HDL-cho-
lesterol, and total cholesterol, respectively
(P  0.0001 for all). Familiality accounted
for 18 and 24% of the variation in systolic
and diastolic blood pressure (P  0.0001),
31% of the variation in HbA
1c
values (P =
0.002), 10­42% of the variation in glucose
levels (P  0.0001), and 11­24% of the
variation in insulin levels during the OGTT
(P = 0.014 for fasting insulin and P 
0.0001 for insulin at 120 min).
Among adult subjects, the majority of
men made their living as farmers (40%)
and laborers (33%), and the majority of
women identified their occupations as
housewives (64%), farmers' wives (10%),
or shopkeepers, teachers, or craft makers
(e.g., quilting) (21%). Of our respondents,
87% said they had no leisure physical activ-
ity, and for those who did, such activities
were mostly walking and playing ball
(baseball, volleyball, or table tennis).
Approximately 42% of men reported they
had ever smoked cigarettes, compared with
only 1.4% of women. Among ever-smok-
ing men, most started smoking cigarettes
between ages 16 and 20 years, but then
stopped smoking in their early 20s. Less
than 3% of all OOA subjects reported that
they currently smoked.
CONCLUSIONS -- The Amish Fam-
ily Diabetes Study was designed to elucidate
the genetic epidemiology of type 2 diabetes
in a genetically well-defined founder popu-
lation. The study population included 5%
of the total adult OOA population in the
Lancaster area. Participation rates for the
study were high, resulting in the enroll-
ment of large families. We were further able
to reconstruct the complex pedigree struc-

ture of the study population through exten-
sive interviews with participating subjects
and by record linkage with the extensive
genealogical database previously compiled
for the Lancaster County OOA population
(17). The mean kinship coefficient in this
population is 0.037, indicating that the
average degree of relatedness between any
two random individuals was less than that
of first-cousins but greater than that of sec-
ond-cousins (23).
The phenotypic characteristics of adult-
onset diabetes in the OOA are similar to typ-
ical type 2 diabetes and, thus, atypical
and/or monogenic forms of diabetes (e.g.,
maturity onset diabetes of the young, mater-
nally-inherited diabetes and deafness, and
type A syndrome of extreme insulin resis-
tance) are uncommon in the Amish. Based
on the association between age of diabetes
diagnosis and GAD antibody prevalence, it is
likely that both types 1 and 2 diabetes exist
in this population. To minimize the possi-
bility that probands for our study had type 1
diabetes, we required that age of diabetes
onset in the proband be at least 35 years.
An unexpected result obtained from this
study was the lower prevalence of diabetes
observed among the OOA compared with
the general U.S. Caucasian population. The
observed prevalence of diabetes among
spouses of probands and their family mem-
bers was only 0.54 as high as that expected
if these individuals had experienced the
same diabetes risk as in the general U.S.
Caucasian population. Interestingly, the
prevalence of IGT in the OOA was similar to
or slightly higher in spouse control subjects,
as compared with the general U.S. Cau-
casian population. This raises the interesting
hypothesis that the OOA may not be pro-
tected against glucose intolerance, but fewer
individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
eventually develop overt diabetes. By virtue
of their predominantly agrarian lifestyle, the
OOA may be more physically active than the
general U.S. Caucasian population. One
speculation is that this relatively active
lifestyle provides partial protection against
conversion from IGT to type 2 diabetes.
Several studies have reported beneficial
effects of physical activity on insulin sensi-
tivity and glucose tolerance (24,25).
Diabetes aggregates in families in the
OOA as it does in other populations
(26,27). In this study, the prevalence of dia-
betes was 3.28 times as high in the siblings
of diabetic probands than in the spouse
control group, a finding similar to that
observed in other Caucasian populations
(28­30). By contrast, there was no familial
aggregation of IGT in the OOA. These find-
ings suggest that genes may be important
determinants of progression of IGT to dia-
betes in the Amish.
To define type 2 diabetes genes, there
may be value in dissecting the type 2 dia-
betes phenotype into genetically less com-
plex traits that may be more proximal to the
underlying pathophysiology. We observed
moderate heritabilities for many of these
quantitatively distributed traits, including
glucose, insulin, obesity, blood pressure,
and lipid levels. The heritability estimates
we obtained from the Amish are in the
range of those reported for other popula-
tions (Table 5).
The OOA (41,42) and other founder
populations (43,44) have been used suc-
cessfully to map genes for simple Mendelian
diseases, especially those characterized by
recessive transmission. More recently,
founder populations have been used to map
genes for complex diseases (45,46), includ-
ing diabetes and related quantitative traits
(47,48). To understand further the genetic
contribution to type 2 diabetes, we have ini-
tiated additional studies of the OOA,
including a genome scan. Because of their
unique ancestral history, there may be
advantages to trying to identify diabetes
susceptibility genes in this population. First,
because of the relatively small number of
founders, it is possible that a complex
genetic disease like type 2 diabetes will have
equally strong genetic determinants in this
population, as compared with the general
Caucasian population, but will be attributed
to a smaller number of genes, which should
facilitate their identification and characteri-
zation. Second, diabetes susceptibility genes
present in the Amish are likely to be a sub-
set of those that are relevant to the general
Caucasian population. Third, the large fam-
ily structure characteristic of the OOA and
the large number of individuals for which
quantitative trait information has been
obtained lead to greater power because of
the very large number of relative pairs that
are present. Fourth, uniformity of lifestyle
may minimize potential confounding effects
of variable phenotypic expression of sus-
ceptibility genes, which would further
enhance our ability to identify these genes.
However, the use of founder populations to
map genes for complex disease poses spe-
cial challenges. For example, the complex
pedigree structures can greatly complicate
the estimation of allele-sharing among pedi-
gree members. In addition, once linkage is
observed, fine mapping may be difficult if
linkage disequilibrium extends over large
regions of the chromosome. Furthermore,
the genetic defects identified in these pop-
ulations will need to be verified in other
populations to evaluate their implication in
public health.
In summary, the OOA are a genetically
and socioculturally well-defined founder
population. Type 2 diabetes in the OOA is

Caucasian population, although its preva-
lence is lower. There is substantial familial
aggregation of the disease, and diabetes-
related quantitative traits are heritable.
These results provide the rationale for a
genome-wide search, which is currently in
progress, for type 2 diabetes susceptibility
genes in this unique population.
