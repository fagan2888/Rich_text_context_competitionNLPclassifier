Abstract
Objective: The use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to identify right-sided infective
endocarditis (RSIE) vegetation is controversial. Data are scarce for patients with no history of
intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) or cardiac device insertion. This study analysed the consistency of
presurgical echocardiographic results with surgical findings for vegetation identification, and the
factors that influence accuracy of echocardiography.
Methods: This retrospective trial divided infective endocarditis (IE) patients into three subgroups
according to the results of their presurgical TTE: left-sided native IE (LSNIE), left-sided prosthetic
valve IE (LSPIE) and RSIE. The accuracy of TTE was tested by comparing vegetation (number and
location), detected presurgery by TTE, with actual findings during surgery.
Results: In total, 416 patients were analysed, 322 with LSNIE, 31 with LSPIE and 63 with RSIE.
Consistency between TTE findings and surgical results was lower in the RSIE group compared with
the LSPIE and LSNIE groups. Consistency was lowered by the presence of vegetation in multiple
locations and atypical distribution ­ both of which were increased in the RSIE group. The chance of
vegetation in both sides of the heart rose with increased numbers of vegetation locations in RSIE
patients. A high proportion of RSIE patients had congenital heart defects, mostly ventricular septal
defects.
Conclusions: TTE may be unsuitable for RSIE patients with no history of IVDA or cardiac device
insertion, because multifocal and atypically distributed vegetation may influence detection
accuracy.

Introduction
Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threaten-
ing disease associated with a high mortality
rate.1­3 Anatomically, IE is characterized by
a combination of vegetative, destructive
lesions and abscess formation.4 Vegetative
lesions are the hallmark lesions of IE, and
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the
best technique for noninvasive visualization
of such lesions, although the results of this
technique are not always accurate.4 The
diagnostic value of TTE in detecting vegeta-
tion is influenced by factors including image
quality, echogenicity, vegetation size, vege-
tation location, previous valvular disease or
valvular prosthesis, experience and skill of
the examiner, and pretest probability of
endocarditis.5 Typically, vegetation presents
as an oscillating mass attached to a valvular
structure, which moves independently to the
valve. The sensitivity of TTE may be reduced
for very small vegetative lesions and there
may be difficulties in identifying vegetation
in the presence of pre-existent severe lesions
(such as mitral valve prolapse, degenerative
lesions and prosthetic valves).6 The identifi-
cation of vegetation may also be difficult
when the lesions are nonoscillating and/or
atypically distributed.4 Conversely, false
diagnosis of IE may occur due to difficulty
differentiating between vegetation and
thrombi, prolapsed cusps, cardiac tumours,
myxomatous changes, Lambl's excrescences,
strands or noninfective vegetations (mar-
antic endocarditis).4,7
Compared with left-sided IE (LSIE), the
incidence of right-sided IE (RSIE) is much
lower, accounting for 5­10% of cases of
IE.8,9 RSIE is most frequently observed in
those with a history of intravenous drug
abuse (IVDA).10­12 The value of TTE as a
method for discovering vegetation is con-
troversial,8,13­15 although TTE allows satis-
factory assessment of large vegetations and
of valvular involvement because of the
anterior location of the tricuspid valve.8,14
San Roman et al. have shown that even the
use of transoesophageal echocardiography
(TEE) did not increase the accuracy of TTE
for the detection of vegetation in tricuspid
endocarditis.15 However, most of these data
were obtained from patients with a history
of IVDA or from those who had received
cardiac devices, with little data presented for
RSIE patients without either of these
histories.
The reported incidence of IE in patients
with congenital heart disease (CHD) is many
times higher than that in the general popu-
lation,16­18 and is particularly high for
RSIE.17 With economic and technological
developments, survival rates have improved
in patients with complicated CHD, but this
has resulted in the emergence of complex
cases of IE.19
The present study retrospectively ana-
lysed patients who received surgery to treat
IE (and any concomitant structural abnor-
mality, if present), and compared the con-
sistency of echocardiographic findings with
surgical findings of vegetation (and
abscesses). This study also compared the
consistency rates between LSIE and RSIE
patients, and analysed factors that influ-
enced the accuracy of TTE judgements for
vegetation in RSIE patients with no history
of IVDA or cardiac device insertion. The
aims of the study were to provide meaningful
information on the diagnosis of RSIE for
echocardiographic experts and clinicians,
and to promote the accuracy of
838 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
identification by highlighting important
issues that are frequently ignored or mis-
understood in clinical work. Such issues are
particularly relevant in the treatment of
patients with CHD.
Methods
Patients
Sequential patients with IE, admitted to
Beijing Anzhen Hospital between January
2002 and May 2012, were enrolled. All
patients included in the study underwent
surgery for at least one of the following:
removing vegetation and/or abscesses; repair-
ing or replacing valves; correcting CHDs. The
patients had received TTE on one of the 0­30
days before the operation. For those who
underwent more than one operation during
the study period, only the results from the
first operation were used in the present ana-
lyses. Patients who were not treated with
surgery, or who were treated with a procedure
that did not require the heart to be opened
(for example coronary artery bypass graft or
pericardial surgery) were not included in the
study. Also excluded were those who did not
receive TTE in the Anzhen Hospital, or those
in whom TTE was not completed 30 days
prior to surgery. Patients with RSIE who
received a cardiac device during their surgery
were also excluded from the study. All
patients were interviewed about their medical
history and were evaluated carefully on
admission and before surgery. The character-
istics of all patients conformed to the Duke
criteria for IE.20
This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Beijing
Anzhen Hospital. All patients (or parents
of patients) provided written informed con-
sent for participation in the study.
Ultrasound assessment
The TTE was performed by highly experi-
enced cardiologists to evaluate the presence,
location and size of vegetations, to provide
systematic evaluation of all the valves in
multiple acquisition angles, and to calculate
cardiac chamber size and ejection fraction.
During TTE, possible vegetations that were
hardly differentiated from a pre-existing
lesion with thickened or calcified leaflets
were regarded as vegetation during analysis.
Interval points were calculated as the time
between the last echocardiography and the
day of surgery, and were then classified into
five groups: 1, 0­3 days; 2, 4­6 days; 3, 7­10
days; 4 , 11­20 days; 5, < 20 days. The
regurgitation point of affected valves had
four degrees of classification: 0, no regurgi-
tation; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. If
patients had an echocardiographic examin-
ation more than once with different results,
the final one prior to surgery was used for
this study. According to TTE, patients were
classified into three subgroups: left-sided
native IE (LSNIE); left-sided prosthetic
valve IE (LSPIE); RSIE. Patients with con-
comitant left- and right-sided IE and CHD
were regarded as RSIE during statistical
analysis.
Transoesophageal echocardiography was
performed on patients at the discretion of
the treating clinician and when results of the
TTE were questionable.
Surgical assessment
Standard blood cultures were taken for
every patient. All patients received anti-
biotics for 4­8 weeks, dosed according to
body weight and creatinine clearance values.
The following regimens were used: penicillin
alone; penicillin in combination with other
antibiotics; cephalosporin in combination
with other antibiotics; vancomycin in com-
bination with other antibiotics. Antifungals
were prescribed for those whose symptoms
were suggestive of a fungal infection.
Duration point refers to the time between
symptom onset and day of surgery, and was
classified into three subgroups for statistical
Xie et al. 839
purposes: 1, 1­30 days; 2, 31­60 days;
3, < 60 days. According to surgical findings,
lesions on the mitral and aortic valves of the
left heart and the tricuspid and pulmonary
valves of the right heart were defined as
typically distributed anatomical vegetation.
Atypical anatomical vegetation included
lesions in the ventricle, atrium, aorta, pul-
monary artery, ductus arteriosus, etc. If no
vegetation was found in the right hearts of
LSNIE and LSPIE patients without struc-
tural heart disease by ultrasound, patients
were not explored surgically and were clas-
sified as having negative findings. If vegeta-
tion was not found during surgery, the TEE
result was considered to be a false positive.
Some patients, therefore, failed to meet the
major and minor Duke criteria for IE diag-
nosis, but were still regarded as IE patients
for this study because of their clinical char-
acteristics, which included fever and severely
damaged valves.
Statistical analyses
Numeric values were reported as
mean Æ SD; age, left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF), heart function, regurgita-
tion point and duration point were com-
pared by analysis of variance. Categorical
variables were compared with 2-test.
Statistical calculations were performed
using SPSSÕ version 16.0 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, IL, USA) and a P-value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. A
sensitivity analysis of patients with or with-
out CHD was also undertaken.
Results
This study analysed 416 IE patients (290
male; 126 female), age range 1­78 years
(median 39.0 years), who conformed to the
Duke criteria for IE.20 Fifteen patients with
concomitant left and right IE and CHD
were regarded as RSIE during statistical
analysis. TEE was performed on 23 (5.5%)
patients, and only 163 (39.2%) had a mean-
ingful positive blood-culture report.
Penicillin alone was prescribed for 25
(6.0%) patients, penicillin in combination
with any other antibiotics for 189 (45.4%),
cephalosporin in combination with any
other antibiotics for 151 (36.3%) and vanco-
mycin in combination with any other anti-
biotics for 50 (12.0%); 78 (18.8%) patients
received antifungal agents, with some
patients receiving antifungal therapy con-
comitantly with antibiotics.
Vegetation was not found during surgery
in 93 patients; the presurgery TTE result was
therefore considered a false positive in 66
patients.
Compared with LSNIE and LSPIE
groups, patients from the RSIE group were
younger, had better LVEF and were less
likely to be male (Table 1). Patients with
LSPIE had the poorest heart function of the
three groups, while RSIE patients had the
best. Regurgitation tended to be milder in
the LSPIE patients compared with the other
groups. In the LSPIE group (n ¼ 31) only
one (3.2%) patient had CHD; 23 (74.2%)
had undergone mechanical valve implant-
ation before IE and the remaining patients
had received biovalves. In the LSNIE group
(n ¼ 322), 77 (23.9%) patients had CHD,
including 12 (3.7%) with ventricular septal
defects (VSD), five (1.6%) with atrial septal
defects (ASD) and 36 with malformations of
the aortic leaf (11.2%); 70 (21.7%) of the
patients were diagnosed with rheumatic
valvular disease but none had received
valvular treatment; the remaining 175
patients had no basic heart disease. There
were 63 RSIE patients, of whom 53 (84.1%)
had CHD: 32 (50.8%) patients had isolated
VSD, three (4.8%) had concomitant VSD
and ASD, 11 (17.5%) had patent ductus
arteriosus, three (4.8%) patients had tetral-
ogy of Fallot, four (6.3%) had very rare
structural abnormalities. One patient (1.6%)
had rheumatic valvular disease. There were
no differences between the groups in terms
840 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
of the duration point or the interval point.
The consistency of the TTE results with the
subsequent surgical findings regarding vege-
tation was much lower in the RSIE group
than in the other groups. Consistency
showed no obvious variability across the
entire study period.
The LSPIE, LSNIE and RSIE groups
were considered to be separate entities in
order to calculate the consistency of TTE
with surgical findings of vegetation. There
were no significant differences between con-
sistency values across the three groups
(Table 2).
The consistency of TTE with surgical
findings for patients with surgically-con-
firmed vegetation is shown in Figure 1A.
Patients with multifocal vegetation (at least
two locations) had significantly lower con-
sistency between TTE results and surgical
findings than patients with vegetation in no
or one location (P ¼ 0.003; 2 ¼ 13.7). After
removing all patients found during surgery
to be free of vegetation (n ¼ 93), patients
with surgically-confirmed atypically
distributed (multifocal) vegetation (n ¼ 32)
had much lower rates of consistency
between TTE and surgical findings than
those with typically distributed vegetation
(n ¼ 291; 37.5% versus 63.0%, P ¼ 0.002)
(Figure 1B).
The RSIE group had a significantly
higher rate of surgically-confirmed multi-
focal vegetation than the LSNIE and LSPIE
groups (38.1%, 22.4%, 0%, P < 0.001;
Figure 2): patients without vegetation find-
ings during surgery were excluded from the
calculation. Of the 32 patients with surgi-
cally-confirmed atypical vegetation, 68.8%,
31.2% and 0% had RSIE, LSNIE and
LSPIE respectively.
Tricuspid IE was the most common site
for vegetation in patients with RSIE, and
was found in 17 (63.0%) of all patients with
vegetation in one location (Table 3). The
chance of concomitant left-sided vegetation
increased as the number of locations with
vegetation increased. The five RSIE
patients who had vegetation in more than
two locations all had CHD, with four of

Although the age range of patients in this
study was wide (1­78 years), there was no
significant difference in terms of consistency
of results between those aged 39 years
(62.0%) and those aged > 39 years (68.1%).
Sensitivity analysis of the 63 patients with
RSIE with or without CHD showed that,
despite low numbers of patients, the pres-
ence of CHD did not influence the
consistency of results for RSIE patients
(consistency for CHD, 28/52 (53.8%), con-

Of 32 patients with surgically-confirmed
vegetation, 14 patients were admitted by
the end of 2007, and the other 18 were
admitted after 2007. Eight-one patients were
surgically-confirmed to have multifocal
vegetation, while 57 were admitted after
2007.

Discussion
Transthoracic echocardiography is regarded
as a useful method for diagnosing RSIE
because it allows easy and correct diagnosis
of tricuspid vegetations.5,21 This is the
commonest affected location in RSIE, and
the majority of patients with endocarditis
are young people with IVDA, who have
large vegetations.8,11 However, in our study,
patients were not IVDA and 53 (84.1%) of
the RSIE patients had CHD. These RSIE
patients were younger, with better heart
function and a more complicated intracar-
diac structure compared with patients with
LSPIE or LSNIE, which may have made
identification of vegetation more difficult in
RSIE patients than in those without struc-
tural heart abnormalities. Compared with
patients with LSNIE or LSPIE, the consist-
ency of echocardiographic identification of
vegetation with actual surgical findings was
lower in the RSIE group. Therefore, the
identification of RSIE by TTE may not be
suitable for patients who have no history of
Figure 2. Patients with infective endocarditis (n ¼ 416) were divided into those with left-sided prosthetic
valve infective endocarditis (LSPIE), left-sided native infective endocarditis (LSNIE) and right-sided infective
endocarditis (RSIE). R rates of consistency between transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and surgical
findings, multifocal locations of vegetations and the proportion of patients with atypically distributed
vegetation were compared.

IVDA or cardiac device insertion, but who
do have structural abnormalities.
Vegetations are typically attached to the
low-pressure side of heart valves including
the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, aortic
valve, and (less frequently) the pulmonary
valve. For these areas, echocardiograpic
images are good. Vegetation may be located
anywhere on the components of the valvular
and subvalvular apparatus, as well as on the
mural endocardium of the cardiac chambers
or the ascending aorta.6 In the present study,
surgery confirmed that atypically distributed
vegetation was present in 32 (7.7%) of all IE
patients, including vegetation in the aorta,
pulmonary artery, left ventricle, right
ventricle and other positions of the left and
right heart. Compared with IE patients with
typically-distributed vegetation, patients
with atypically distributed vegetation had
reduced consistency (by 28.0%) between
TTE and surgical findings. This phenom-
enon was even more striking among RSIE
patients. RSIE vegetation may not only be
entrapped in the tricuspid and chordal
apparatus, but also in mural and atrial or
ventricular defect areas, and sometimes may
present as embolized vegetation floating free
in the right ventricle or pulmonary
artery.4,22,23 In the present study, VSD was
the dominant type of congenital abnormal-
ity for RSIE patients, and the chances of
atypically distributed vegetation were higher
for these patients than for those with LSNIE
and LSPIE. In addition, we found a much
lower consistency between TTE and surgical
identification of vegetation among RSIE
patients than among LSIE patients, which
differs from a case report confirming TTE
validity for diagnosing atypically distributed
RSIE vegetation.24 In our opinion, TTE
may not be adequate for diagnosing sus-
pected IE patients with CHD and/or atyp-
ically distributed vegetation because of its
poor accuracy, especially for RSIE patients.
Although the need for routine TEE in RSIE
remains questionable, it may be useful in
detecting unusual localizations of RSIE,
such as infection on the Eustachian valve
or on the Chiari network;25,26 in addition,
TEE is more sensitive than TTE in the
detection of pulmonary vegetation and
abscesses (particularly those adjacent to
the membranous septum), and associated
left-sided involvement.27 When necessary,
X-ray or computed tomography should also
be considered, to exclude pulmonary
embolism.
In the present study, the consistency rate
of TTE with surgical findings was only
45.7% when multifocal vegetations were
verified during surgery. For RSIE patients,
24 (38.1%) had more than two vegetation
involved locations, which may be related to

the high proportion of structural abnormal-
ities in the hearts of these patients. For RSIE
patients with no history of IVDA or cardiac
device insertion, attention is needed to
identify widely distributed vegetation, espe-
cially those lesions that are atypically
located. According to some reports, TEE is
useful for identifying multifocal IE affecting
valves, mural areas within atria and ven-
tricles, and arteries.28­30
In our study the tricuspid was the most
commonly affected valve in the right heart,
and most patients with multifocal vegetation
had CHD. Although some RSIE patients
presented with left heart vegetation, only
three (4.8%) patients had cyanotic CHD (all
tetralogy of Fallot) and very few had trivial
right-to-left shunt. In our opinion, this
means that patients with CHD may have a
higher risk of concomitant RSIE and LSIE
even at an early disease stage, before a severe
haemodynamic disorder. It seems VSD
patients with associated valvular regurgita-
tion have higher incidences of IE,31 but it
remains unclear whether the rectification of
a structural abnormality reduces the risk of
LSIE for patients who already have tricus-
pid regurgitation due to VSD or an ASD.
Whether or not left-to-right shunts are pre-
sent for RSIE patients with CHD, especially
VSD, we consider that special attention is
needed to investigate multifocal as well as
concomitant left-sided vegetation, which
seems to be more dangerous than isolated
RSIE vegetation and should always be
treated more aggressively by surgery. TEE
is also recommended for CHD patients with
suspicions of concomitant RSIE and
LSIE.29,30
Several shortcomings with the present
study should be mentioned. First, as a
retrospective study, data were as good as
were available, and were not always per-
fect. For example, although the complete
study consistency (TTE results and surgi-
cal findings) was > 80% in our analysis,
very few people received TEE (which
should be considered in patients with
poor image quality with TTE, and in
those who have a negative TTE result
despite a moderate or high level of clinical
suspicion of IE).32 The decision to operate
on patients without a TEE was taken
because most of the IE patients in this
study had concomitant CHD and surgery
was already necessary to correct a con-
genital abnormality. Secondly, the diag-
nosis of IE may be difficult at an early
disease stage, when vegetative lesions are
not yet present or are too small to be
identified.33 In this study, a few patients
presenting with complicated pathologies
had different TTE findings by the same
cardiologist over a period of several days,
so the final one (before surgery) was used
in order to fulfil the study objective.
Thirdly, with rapid development of the
hospital facilities over recent decades, the
echocardiographic equipment has greatly
improved, which was difficult to take into
consideration in our study. However, the
accuracy of echocardiographic identifica-
tion appeared to be similar year on year,
despite improvements in equipment.
Noticeably, 18 (56.6%) of patients with
atypically distributed vegetation and 57
(70.4%) with multifocal vegetation were
admitted after 2007 rather than in the first
half of the study, which made the diagnosis
of IE more challenging for doctors in the
latter half of the study, even with better
apparatus, and can to some extent explain
the similar accuracy of TTE over the
decade. No literature is available to com-
pare the accuracy between the old and the
more advanced echocardiographic appar-
atus in terms of RSIE, but careful selection
of transducers (sometimes higher fre-
quency transducers may improve spatial
resolution), the use of the `zoom function',
and paying attention to the adjustment of
sector width, depth and focus settings are
recommended for accurate identification
of vegetation in the right heart.4
Xie et al. 845
The time delay between the last echocar-
diography and surgery may influence the
accuracy of vegetation identification, but
was similar between the groups and there-
fore unlikely to influence the results of this
study. Ideally, echocardiography should
occur 1­3 days before surgery, considering
the instability of vegetative lesions in the
heart.
This study recorded a very low rate of
positive blood cultures. This is likely due to
the fact that Beijing Anzhen Hospital is a
tertiary referral centre, receiving patients
with IE from around the country, most of
whom had received antibiotics in their local
hospital prior to transfer.
The experiences of other developed coun-
tries in the treatment of patients with IE may
not translate well to Chinese society because
of different social and health backgrounds.
For example, the incidence of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is
higher in China than in western nations,
partly because of higher rates of smoking
and pollution in China.34 Patients with
COPD with barrel chests may have a lower
rate of accuracy of vegetation identification
in the right heart (where blood velocity is
slower than in the left side) with TTE,
compared with patients without COPD.35
Our results are applicable to patients world-
wide. Further research to investigate the
accuracy of echocardiography for diagnos-
ing IE without IVDA, but with CHD and
other diseases, is worthwhile.
In conclusion, the objective findings from
surgery in this retrospective study have
shown that TTE may not be ideal for
investigating vegetation in RSIE patients
with no history of IVDA or cardiac device
insertion. To promote accurate rates of TTE
identification, doctors should be very alert
to multifocal and atypically distributed
vegetative lesions. For RSIE patients com-
plicated with CHD, special caution is
needed to exclude the potential presence of
concomitant left-sided vegetation.
