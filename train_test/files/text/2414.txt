Association of Sibling Aggression With Child and
Adolescent Mental Health
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Popular press and research
show that sibling aggression is common. Too often, however, it
is dismissed as benign, and other forms of child aggression,
such as peer aggression, are considered more serious. Peer
aggression is linked to poorer mental health.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Using a national probability sample, we
show that the nature and severity of sibling aggression have
negative links to children's and adolescents' mental health. We
demonstrate that sibling and peer aggression are comparable
their links to symptoms of distress.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: Sibling aggression is common but often dismissed as
benign. We examine whether being a victim of various forms of sibling
aggression is associated with children's and adolescents' mental
health distress. We also contrast the consequences of sibling versus
peer aggression for children's and adolescents' mental health.
METHODS: We analyzed a national probability sample (n = 3599) that
included telephone interviews about past year victimizations con-
ducted with youth aged 10 to 17 or an adult caregiver concerning
children aged 0 to 9.
RESULTS: Children ages 0 to 9 and youth ages 10 to 17 who experienced
sibling aggression in the past year (ie, psychological, property, mild or
severe physical assault), reported greater mental health distress. Chil-
dren ages 0 to 9 showed greater mental health distress than did youth
aged 10 to 17 in the case of mild physical assault, but they did not differ
for the other types of sibling aggression. Comparison of sibling versus
peer aggression generally showed that sibling and peer aggression
independently and uniquely predicted worsened mental health.
CONCLUSIONS: The possible importance of sibling aggression for
children's and adolescents' mental health should not be dismissed.
The mobilization to prevent and stop peer victimization and bullying
should expand to encompass sibling aggression as well. Pediatrics

ARTICLE
Parents and others often minimize the
frequency and severity of aggressive
behavior among siblings. Such a re-
sponse reflects the historical accep-
tance by researchers and the general
public of sibling aggression as benign
and normal1 and even beneficial for
their children's social development and
their ability to handle aggression in
other relationships.2 As such, sibling
aggression remains an unrecognized
form of violence,3 even though similar
aggressive behavior among peers is
perceived as problematic.4,5 Victims of
peer aggression report poorer mental
health, including greater depression
and anxiety.6,7 Findings from the few
small studies of sibling aggression,
which are typically conducted with
convenience samples and limited to
the assessment of physical assault,
also show its occurrence is linked with
poorer mental health.8,9
In the current study, using a national
probabilitysample,weexaminedwhether
being a victim of sibling aggression is
associated with children's and adoles-
cents' mental health. In doing so, we
provide a comprehensive picture of the
links between sibling aggression and
mental health through our examination
of 3 subtypes of sibling aggression:
physical assault, property victimiza-
tion, and psychological aggression by
a sibling. Our analyses also addressed
the importance of severity and fre-
quency of sibling aggression for men-
tal health. We compared levels of
distress symptoms for those who did
or did not experience more mild forms
of physical assault (without a weapon
or resulting injury), as well as for those
who did and did not report being the
victim of more severe forms of physical
assault: those involving a weapon or
causing injury. We also compared the
mental health of children and adoles-
cents who experienced either none, 1,
or 2 or more types of sibling aggres-
sion. We hypothesized that child and
adolescent victims of each type of sib-
ling aggression would report greater
mental distress than those who did not
experience sibling victimization. Also,
we expected that experiencing more
types of sibling victimization would be
linked to greater mental health dis-
tress.
The rate of sibling aggression is at
its height before adolescence,10,11 but
the severity of sibling aggression
peaks in adolescence when the highest
rates of injury and weapon use are
reported.11,12 It is unknown, however,
if the linksbetween sibling aggression
and mentalhealth differ for children
versus adolescents despite variation in
the frequency and severity of sibling
aggression. Finally, to address the as-
sumption that sibling aggression is less
serious than peer aggression,13 we
compared sibling versus peer aggres-
sion links to children's and adolescents'
mental health, expecting that sibling
aggression would have unique and
similar associations with mental health,
because in both cases, the experience
involves child-to-child aggression.12
METHODS
ThedataarefromTheNationalSurveyof
Children's Exposure to Violence, which
was designed to obtain incidence and
prevalence estimates of a wide range
of childhood victimizations.14 A nation-
wide sampling frame of residential
telephone numbers from which a sam-
ple of telephone households was
drawn by random digit dialing was
created. To ensure that the study in-
cluded a sizeable proportion of mi-
norities and low-income respondents
for more accurate subgroup analyses,
there was an oversampling of US tele-
phone exchanges that had a population
of 70% or more of African American,
Hispanic, or low-income households.
The current research focuses on 3599
children aged 1 month to 17 years who
had at least 1 sibling younger than 18
living in the household at the time
of the interview. The interviews with
parents and youth were conducted
over the phone by the employees of a
survey research firm. Telephone inter-
views are commonly used to gather
information about violence and vic-
timizations (eg, US Department of
Justice's National Crime Victimization
Survey) and have been shown to be
comparably reliable and valid to in-
person interviews.15
Sample weights were applied to adjust
for differential probability of selection
because of study design, demographic
variations in nonresponse, and varia-
tions in within-household eligibility. The
sample was approximately evenly di-
vided across gender (51% male) and
age. In terms of ethnicity, 63% of the
children and youth were white and non-
Hispanic followed by 18% Hispanic, any
race; 13% black, non-Hispanic; and 6%
other race, non-Hispanic. Most of the
sample was from 2-parent households
(69%) or single-parent families (20%).
Forty-six percent of parents had a
bachelor's degree (versus 27% with
some college and 27% with a high
school degree or less).
Theadultcaregiver(usuallyaparent)in
each household provided family de-
mographic information. One child was
randomly selected from all eligible chil-
dren living in a household by selecting
the child with the most recent birthday.
Selected children aged 10 to 17 years
completed the telephone interview via
self-report. For selected children youn-
ger than 10, the caregiver who "is most
familiar with the child's daily routine and
experiences" completed the interview. A
safety protocol was implemented to en-
sure confidentiality of responses and
privacy during the interview.
Respondents were paid $20 for their
participation. The interviews were
conducted in both English and Spanish
and averaged 45 minutes in length. Al-
mostalloftheadolescentsaged10to17
80 TUCKER et al
were interviewed in English. Respond-
ents who disclosed a situation of seri-
ous threat or ongoing victimization
were recontacted by a research team
clinical member trained in telephone
crisis counseling whose responsibility
was to stay in contact with the re-
spondent until the situation was re-
solved. Respondents who refused to
participate (or could not be reached),
but for whom parent screener in-
formation was obtained, were not sys-
tematically different from respondents
on victimization risk.
Sibling and Peer Aggression
Sibling and peer aggression were
assessed via items from an enhanced
version of the Juvenile Victimization
Questionnaire (JVQ).16 The enhanced
JVQ obtained reports on 48 types of
youth victimization covering 5 general
areas of interest: conventional crime,
maltreatment, victimization by peers
and siblings, sexual victimization, and
witnessing and indirect victimization.17
Follow-up questions gathered addi-
tional information about each victimi-
zation, including characteristics of the
perpetrator, whether the event oc-
curred in the past year, and whether
a weapon was used or injury resulted.
Reports by caregivers versus children
younger than 10 for this measure have
shown to be comparable.16
We constructed measures to capture
the range and extent of sibling-
perpetrated aggression. The constructed
measures count only those experiences
that occurred in the past year and that
were perpetrated by a juvenile sibling
residing in the same household as
the interviewed child. Two of the di-
chotomous measures pertain to physi-
cal aggression by a sibling: physical
assault with no object/weapon or injury
and physical assault involving an object/
weapon or causing injury. One dichot-
omous measure assesses sibling prop-
erty aggression (force used to take
somethingaway from childthat the child
was carrying or wearing; something
stolen from child and never given back;
and child's things broken or ruined on
purpose). Another dichotomous mea-
sure captured whether the child had
experienced psychological aggression
by a sibling (child felt bad or scared
because a sibling was "calling him/her
names, saying mean things, or saying
they didn't want him/her around"). The
questions for property and psychologi-
cal victimization were asked only of
children aged 2 years and older. Addi-
tional variables were created based on
the combination of the above variables
to assess the extent of experiencing
different types of sibling aggression. To
do so, we created variables based on
a count of the number of sibling victim-
ization types experienced by children
and adolescents over the past year. Al-
though we were unable to assess the
frequency with which each type of sib-
ling victimization occurred over the
past year with the available data, we
believe our data are likely to provide
unique and perhaps more reliable in-
formation than the typical retrospective
measures of frequency of episodes.12
These variables included (1) sibling
physical aggression (if the child or ad-
olescent experienced either of the 2
subtypes of sibling physical aggression
(a dichotomous variable); (2) total types
of sibling aggression, which is summed
across the 4 types of sibling aggression
(a continuous variable); (3) None versus
1 experience of sibling aggression
summed across the 4 types (a di-
chotomous variable); and (4) 1 versus 2
or more experiences of sibling aggres-
sion summed across the 4 types (a di-
chotomous variable). Measures were
also constructed for past-year victim-
izations perpetrated by nonsibling peers
using the same process and criteria: (1)
peer physical aggression (includes
whether the child was hit, beaten, or
attacked with or without an object and
whether injury resulted); (2) peer
property aggression; (3) peer psycho-
logical aggression; and (4) total types of
peer aggression.
Mental Health
Children's and adolescents' mental
health was assessed by 2 closely re-
lated measures: the Trauma Symptom
Checklist for Young Children,18 which
was used in the caregiver interviews
for children 9 years and younger, and
the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for
Children,19 which was used with the
10- to 17-year-old adolescents' self-
report interviews. Reporters indicated
how often they (or their children) ex-
perienced items in the anger, depres-
sion, and anxiety scales from each
measure in the past month on a 4-point
scale (0 = not at all to 4 = very often).
Cronbach's a for the Trauma Symptom
Checklist for Young Children was 0.86
(28 items) and for the Trauma Symp-
toms Checklist for Children was 0.93
(25 items). Because these measures
are often and generally used in their
entirety,20­23 and we were interested
only in global mental health, we cre-
ated a total mental health distress
score. The item wording, however, dif-
fered for the 2 measures so the total
score for the sample was created by
summing the anger, depression, and
anxiety scales of each measure and
then standardizing and merging the
standardized mental health scores for
each age group. Higher scores indicate
greater mental health distress.
Demographic Characteristics
Demographic measures included in
these analyses were the following:
child's gender; child's age (coded into 2
groups: 0­9 vs 10­17 years of age);
child's race/ethnicity (coded into 4
groups: white non-Hispanic; Hispanic
any race; black non-Hispanic; and other
race, non-Hispanic); and parent ed-
ucation for parent with the most edu-
cation (high school or less, some

college, or college graduate). Finally,
a variable was constructed to indicate
whether the parent interview was
conducted in Spanish (0 = no; 1 = yes).
RESULTS
Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were
conducted to assess whether there are
distress symptom score differences for
children and adolescents who did ver-
sus did not experience each type of
sibling aggression in the past year. The
ANCOVAs controlled for parent educa-
tion level, ethnicity, language of the in-
terview, and child gender. Also, to limit
any confounds because of the impact
of other types of victimizations,24 we
controlled for participants' past year
experiences of nonsibling assault, non-
sibling property victimization, nonsib-
ling psychological victimization child
maltreatment,sexualvictimization,school
and Internet victimization, and witness-
ing family and community violence
collected as part of the JVQ measure.
Because of developmental differences
in the frequency of sibling aggression11
and to test if there were age differ-
ences in the links between sibling
aggression and mental health, an in-
teraction term between sibling aggres-
sion type and age (childhood versus
adolescence) was included in each of
the models.
The ANCOVA models for the 2 sibling
physical assault variables were signif-
icant (F16,2583
= 62.80, P , .001, for
sibling physical assault with a weapon
or resulting injury; F16,2583
= 63.53, P ,
.001 for sibling physical assault with
no weapon or resulting injury). Main
effects in each model showed that
children and adolescents who experi-
enced a sibling assault of either type
(with or without a weapon and/or
resulting injury) reported higher dis-
tress symptom scores (see Fig 1) than
those who did not experience any
sibling assault. In the model that
included physical assault with no
weapon or resulting injury, the age in-
teraction was significant (F1,2583
= 8.44,
P = 0.01), indicating that mental
health differences between those who
reported experiencing this type of sib-
ling aggression and those who did not
was greater in children than in ado-
lescents (M = 0.43 versus M = 0.12 for
children; M = ­0.02 versus M = ­0.10
for adolescents). The interaction be-
tween age and physical assault with
a weapon/injury was nonsignificant.
The overall models for sibling property
and sibling psychological aggression
also were significant (F16,2583
= 61.78,
P , .001; F16,2583
= 48.84, P , .001,
respectively), showing significant
main effects for property aggression
(F1,2583
= 9.82, P , .001) and psycho-
logical aggression (F1,2583
= 16.80, P ,
.001). The results revealed that chil-
dren and adolescent sibling victims
reported greater distress than those
children and adolescents who were not
victims of property or psychological
aggression (see Table 1). The inter-
action terms with age were non-
significant. In sum, all types of sibling
aggression, both mild and severe, were
associated with significantly higher
distress symptom scores for both chil-
dren and adolescents.
Next,weexploredwhetherexperiencing
multipletypesofsiblingaggressionwas
associated with increased distress
scores. Thirty-two percent (n = 1033) of
children and adolescents reported ex-
periencing 1 type of sibling victimiza-
tion in the past year; 8% (n = 286)
reported being the victim of 2 or more
types. ANCOVAs were conducted that

82 TUCKER et al
included the same control variables
and an interaction term with age as
in the previous analyses. The overall
model comparing 1 versus no types of
sibling aggression was significant
(F16,2581
= 54.28, P , .001) and a main
effect for this variable (F1,2381
= 35.92,
P , .001) showed that experiencing
just 1 type of sibling aggression over
the past year was associated with
greater mental health distress (M =
­0.05 versus M = 0.19) than experi-
encing none. The model comparing 1
versus 2 or more types was also sig-
nificant (F16,1026
= 25.79, P , .001), re-
vealing that children and adolescents
who experienced a greater number of
sibling aggression types reported
greater mental health distress (M =
0.30 versus M = 0.54).
To assess whether sibling and peer
aggression made unique contributions
to children's and adolescents' mental
health, ANCOVAs were conducted sep-
arately for 3 types of aggression:
physical, property, and psychological.
The 2 subcategories of sibling physical
aggression were combined for effi-
ciency of presentation and due to
similarity of findings. Multiple re-
gression was used to analyze total
types of sibling aggression types and
total types of peer aggression types as
predictor variables. ANCOVAs and mul-
tiple regression analyses controlled
for parent education level; ethnicity;
language of the interview; child age;
child gender; participants' past year
experiences of child maltreatment;
sexual, school, and Internet victimiza-
tion; and witnessing family and com-
munity violence, and included Sibling 3
Peer interaction terms for each type of
aggression to test whether children's
and adolescents' mental health varied
depending on whether they experi-
enced sibling and peer aggression
singly or in combination. All 3 ANCOVA
models were significant with sibling and
peer aggression, making independent
and unique contributions to children's
and adolescents' mental health in 2 of
the models. The model for property
aggression was the 1 exception in
which peer but not sibling aggression
was a significant predictor. Also, there
was a significant Sibling 3 Peer phys-
ical aggression interaction term, and
follow-up Tukey tests showed signifi-
cant differences across all possible
combinations. This meant that children
and adolescents who had experienced
both sibling and peer physical ag-
gression in the past year reported
higher levels of distress than those
who experienced peer aggression or
sibling aggression alone (see Table 2).
The interaction terms for the models
exploring property and psychological
aggression were not significant. The
regression model examining the rela-
tive effects of total types of sibling ag-
gression and total types of peer
aggression was significant (F17,2638
=
55.81, P , .001) and 2 main effects
revealed that those children and ado-
lescents who were the victims of
a greater number of sibling and peer
aggression types had greater mental
health distress. The interaction term
was nonsignificant, suggesting that
children's and adolescents' mental
health did not differ depending on
whether they experienced total types of
sibling and peeraggression singly or in
combination.
DISCUSSION
Using a national probability sample, we
showed that past-year sibling aggres-
sion was associated with significantly
worse children's and adolescents'
mental health. This connection was
evident for both mild and severe forms
of sibling aggression and for those who
had experienced just 1 as well as
multiple types of sibling aggression in
the past year. Although mental health
distress was greater for children than
for adolescents who experienced mild
sibling physical assault, children and
adolescents were similarly affected by
other forms of sibling aggression. Al-
though peer aggression is generally
perceived as being more serious than
sibling aggression,13 our analyses
showed that sibling and peer physical
and psychological aggression had in-
dependent effects on mental health
and that the mental health of those
experiencing sibling versus peer
property and psychological aggression
did not differ. Our work adds to the
limited literature on sibling aggression
generally characterized by small, non-
representative samples.8,9 Our nation-
ally representative study also removed
the confounding influence of other
kinds of victimization exposure and to
assess the effects of multiple types of
sibling aggression. Thus, we were able

to show the damaging effects of sev-
eral forms of sibling aggression,
independent of other co-occurring vic-
timizations. Another important strength
of our study is that it included in-
formation about sibling aggression
from early childhood through late ad-
olescence. Although many national
studies do not include young children
because they may not be able to ef-
fectively answer questions, our proxy
interviews with caregivers of children
younger than 10 years provide data
otherwise unattainable. A possible
limitation of such data, however, is that
younger children's information may be
incomplete because caregivers may
not be able to provide a full inventory
of sibling aggression exposures. How-
ever, caregiver and children's reports
on our measure of victimization have
been shown to be comparable.16 An-
other limitation of our work is that we
were unable to determine the direction
of effects between aggression and
mental health.
CONCLUSIONS
Taken together, our study shows that
sibling aggression is not benign for
childrenandadolescents,regardlessof
how severe or frequent. An implication
of our work is that parents, pedia-
tricians, and the public should treat
sibling aggression as potentially
harmful and something not to be
dismissed as normal, minor, or even
beneficial. Besides communicating
this message directly to parents
during pediatric visits, another ave-
nue to disseminate this message
would be to have popular parent ed-
ucation programs (eg, Triple P Posi-
tive Parenting Program) to include
a greater focus on sibling aggression
and successful mediation of sibling
conflicts.25 An important next step is
to gather longitudinal data to further
examine the implications of various
patterns of sibling aggression experi-
ences for mental health and whether
these patterns vary by birth order and
gender.
