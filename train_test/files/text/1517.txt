ABSTRACT
There is a high prevalence of chronic hyponatremia in the elderly, frequently owing to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone secretion (SIADH). Recent reports have shown that even mild hyponatremia is associated with impaired gait stability and
increased falls. An increased risk of falls among elderly hyponatremic patients represents a risk factor for fractures, which would be
further amplified if hyponatremia also contributed metabolically to bone loss. To evaluate this possibility, we studied a rat model of
SIADH and analyzed data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). In rats, dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) analysis of excised femurs established that hyponatremia for 3 months significantly reduced bone mineral density
by approximately 30% compared with normonatremic control rats. Moreover, micro-computed tomography (mCT) and histomorpho-
metric analyses indicated that hyponatremia markedly reduced both trabecular and cortical bone via increased bone resorption and
decreased bone formation. Analysis of data from adults in NHANES III by linear regression models showed that mild hyponatremia is
associated with increased odds of osteoporosis (T-score ­2.5 or less) at the hip [odds ratio (OR) ¼ 2.85; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03­
7.86; p < .01]; all models were adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, history of diuretic use, history of
smoking, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. Our results represent the first demonstration that chronic hyponatremia
causes a substantial reduction of bone mass. Cross-sectional human data showing that hyponatremia is associated with significantly
increased odds of osteoporosis are consistent with the experimental data in rodents. Our combined results suggest that bone quality
should be assessed in all patients with chronic hyponatremia. ß 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Introduction
Hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium concentration [Naþ]
of less than 135 mmol/L, is the most frequently encountered
metabolic disorder in clinical practice.(1) It is especially common
in elderly individuals, with reported incidences from 7% to 53%
in ambulatory and institutionalized geriatric patients, respec-
tively.(2­6) Approximately 50% of chronic hyponatremia is due to
the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
(SIADH).(7,8) Other causes include medications (e.g., diuretics),
hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hepatic cirrhosis, renal
disease, and congestive heart failure.(9­11) Although chronic
hyponatremia historically has been difficult to treat, the recent
development of oral antagonists to the renal vasopressin V2
receptor offers the likelihood that both acute and chronic
hyponatremia will be correctable in the near future.(12,13) Thus
this represents a opportune time to evaluate the adverse effects
of chronic hyponatremia.
Chronic hyponatremia is often described as ``asymptomatic''
as a result of volume regulatory processes,(14) but potential long-
term adverse effects have not been carefully evaluated in
controlled studies. Recent reports have suggested that chronic
hyponatremia may not be a benign condition.(15­18) Even mild
hyponatremia (serum [Naþ] ¼ 126 to 134 mmol/L) has been
shown to have significant effects on cognitive function and gait
stability and has been associated with a 67-fold increased odds

ratio for falling compared with normonatremic control indivi-
duals.(19) Although an increased risk of falls among elderly
hyponatremic patients clearly represents a risk factor for
fractures, the risk of fracture would be further amplified if
hyponatremia also contributed to bone loss in the elderly.
Radioisotope measurements demonstrated that approxi-
mately one-third of total-body sodium is stored in bone and
that the release of this sodium from bone during prolonged
deprivation requires the resorption of bone matrix, similar to the
release of stored calcium to compensate for calcium depriva-
tion.(20­23) Despite indications from these classic studies of the
importance of bone in sodium homeostasis, the effects of
hyponatremia on bone resorption and bone mineralization have
not been studied. We therefore initiated these studies to
evaluate the possibility that hyponatremia may cause increased
bone resorption in an attempt to release body stores of
exchangeable sodium. Using an animal model of the human
hyponatremic disease SIADH,(24) we monitored changes in
trabecular and cortical bone mineral content, histomorpho-
metric parameters of bone resorption and formation, and serum
parameters of calcium homeostasis and calcium regulating
hormones. We assessed the clinical relevance of our findings by
analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) to test the hypothesis that
hyponatremia is independently associated with increased odds
of low bone mineral density in a representative sample of US
adults aged 50 years and older.
Materials and Methods
Animal model of chronic hyponatremia
All experimental procedures were accomplished according to
the guidelines in the ``Care and Use of Animals,'' available at
www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn¼0309053773. The Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee of Georgetown University
approved all animal experimentation according to federal and
institutional policies and regulations. To produce hyponatremia,
male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old, 250 to 300 g;
Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA) were infused with
desmopressin (DDAVP, Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) at a rate
of 5 ng/h via a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump
(Alzet Model 2004; Durect Co., Cupertino, CA, USA) and were fed
70 mL/d of a nutritionally balanced rodent liquid formula
(F1268SP, BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ, USA) at a caloric density of
1.0 kcal/mL.(24) At typical daily intakes, this supplied 30 IU/d of
vitamin D3
and 155 mg/d of calcium (5.16 g/kg). Liquid diet was
administered via liquid diet feeding tubes (No. 9010, BioServ).
Rats were housed intermittently in metabolic cages (No. 650-
0100, Nalgene) for 24 hour urine collections. In experiment 1, the
control group received a solid diet identical to the liquid diet in
composition (AIN-76) and were infused with DDAVP. In
experiment 2, one group of control rats received a solid AIN-
76 diet and another group the liquid diet without DDAVP. In both
experiments, the hyponatremic groups received DDAVP and the
liquid diet. Rats in one of the hyponatremic groups and rats on
the solid AIN-76 diet in experiment 2 also received biweekly
intramuscular injections of 50,000 U/kg vitamin D3
(GeroVita-
mins, Zalmoxian Products, London, UK). Body weight was
measured biweekly. The osmotic minipumps were replaced
monthly to maintain constant desmopressin levels. Serum or
plasma sodium levels were monitored monthly and remained
stable over the duration of the 3 month experiments. Survival
blood (2 mL) was collected by tail vein venipuncture under
inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane (3% in oxygen at 0.5 L/min).
Nonsurvival blood was collected by cardiac puncture, also under
isoflurane anesthesia; after blood collection, isoflurane dose was
increased until the lack of heart contraction and respiration
indicated death. Urine samples were collected over 24 hrs at the
end of each month, both with and without preservative. Nine rats
per group were studied in experiment 1 and six rats per group in
experiment 2.
Evaluation of excised bones
Bone mineral density (BMD) of excised femora was measured using
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a small-animal DXA
scanner (Piximus II, Lunar GE, Madison, WI, USA) equipped with
high-resolution scanning software (Version 2.10). Densitometer
stability was tested daily before measurements by scanning a
phantom provided by the company. Over the past year, stability
was characterized by a coefficient of variation of 0.466% from the
last 17 measurements. Additionally, femora were preserved in
ethanol and placed on a Delrin block supplied with the scanner.
Three measurements were taken from each bone. The coefficient
of variation of this measurement was 0.7%.
Micro-computed tomographic (mCT) imaging of ethanol-
preserved femora was performed at the University of Connecti-
cut Health Center by Dr Douglas Adams. Trabecular and cortical
compartments of femora were quantified using a cone beam
microfocus X-ray instrument (mCT40, Scanco Medical AG,
Bru
¨ttisellen, Switzerland). Serial tomographic images were
acquired at 55 kV and 145 mA, collecting 1000 projections per
rotation at 300 ms integration time. 3D images were
reconstructed using standard convolution backprojection algo-
rithms with Shepp and Logan filtering and rendered within a
16.4 mm field of view at a discrete density of 244,140 voxels/mm3
(isometric 16 mm voxels). Segmentation of bone from marrow
and soft tissue was performed in conjunction with a constrained
Gaussian filter to reduce noise, applying density thresholds of
710 and 595 mg/cm3 for the cortical and trabecular compart-
ments of the femur, respectively. Volumetric regions for
trabecular analysis were selected within the endosteal borders
of the distal femoral metaphysis to include the secondary
spongiosa located 1.6 mm ($4% of length) from the growth
plate and extending 3.2 mm proximally. Trabecular morphome-
try included the bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular
thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular
spacing (Tb.Sp), and these were measured directly without
imposing a structural model (e.g., rod or plate).(25) For cortical
morphometry, 100 serial cross sections (1.6 mm) extending
distally from the diaphyseal midpoint between proximal and
distal growth plates were obtained. Cortical measurements
included average cortical thickness, cross-sectional area of
cortical bone, and subperiosteal cross-sectional area. Instrument
and operator precision were quantified by repeated measure-

ments of the same bones and expressed as individual
coefficients of variation for each parameter of trabecular
morphology, yielding values of less than 3% for nearly all
parameters, and typically less than 1%.
Bone histology and histomorphometry were done on femora
and tibiae in experiment 1 and on femora, tibiae, and lumbar
spine in experiment 2. To obtain dynamic histomorphometric
parameters, rats were injected intraperitoneally at the end of
experiment 2 with calcein (15 mg/kg) 14 days before euthanasia
and with xylenol orange (90 mg/kg) 3 days before euthanasia.
Excised femora and tibiae from experiment 1 were fixed in 70%
ethanol, dehydrated in 95% ethanol, and stored in 100% ethanol.
Sample preparation and staining were carried out at the Armed
Forces Institute of Pathology, Department of Scientific Labora-
tory (Washington, DC). The distal parts of femora were
embedded in methyl methacrylate resin without prior decalci-
fication. Consecutive 5 mm thick longitudinal sections were
stained according to Von Kossa and Goldner's Masson-trichrome
methods. In addition, the proximal halves of the tibiae were
preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin, decalcified using
formic acid solution, embedded in paraffin, and stained for
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using the acid
phosphatase reagents and the recommended procedure from
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA. Similarly, excised tibiae from
experiment 2 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phos-
phate-buffered formalin (pH 7.4) at 48C for 7 days. Sample
preparation, staining, and histomorphometric analysis were
carried out by the laboratory of Dr Gloria Gronowicz (Bone
Histomorphometry Center, University of Connecticut Health
Center, Farmington, CT, USA). The proximal halves of tibiae were
decalcified in EDTA/NH3
OH, dehydrated in progressive concen-
trations of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin.
The embedded bones were sectioned longitudinally and stained
for TRAP and counterstained with hematoxylin. In addition, we
carried out analysis on the lumbar vertebrae from experiment 2.
Bones were frozen using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled heat extractor
(Gentle Jane, Instrumedics, Inc., Hackensack, NJ, USA) and Cryo-
Gel preservative (Instrumedics) on a metal grid. Longitudinal
5 mm thick frozen sections were cut using a cryostat (Leica
CM3050) and tungsten carbide knife. Sections were transferred
to adhesive-coated slides using the CryoJane tape-transfer
system (Instrumedics) and postfixed in paraformaldehyde.
Consecutive 5 mm thick longitudinal sections were stained with
5% silver nitrate according to the von Kossa method and
according to Goldner's trichrome method (protocol from
Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and for TRAP.
From all sections, histomorphometric measurements were
taken from the secondary spongiosa and restricted to a 4 mm2
area 400 mm distal to the growth plate­metaphyseal junction,
according to standard procedures.(26) Histomorphometric
measurements were made in a blinded, nonbiased manner
using the BioQuant computerized image analysis system
(BioQuant, R&M Biometrics, Nashville, TN, USA) interfaced with
a Zeiss 410 inverted microscope. Static histomorphometric
parameters were obtained from both experiments. Multi-
nucleated TRAP-positive cells in close proximity to trabecular
surfaces were counted as osteoclasts. Dynamic histompho-
metric parameters were obtained from 5 mm undecalcified
sections using fluorescence microscopy and a dual excitation
filter from Chroma Technology (Bellows Falls, VT, USA).
Chemistry
Serum glucose, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium,
potassium, bicarbonate, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and
albumin were measured using a microanalyzer. Corrected serum
calcium levels were calculated according to the following
formula: Corrected calcium ¼ measured serum calcium þ [(4 ­
serum albumin) Â 0.8]. Plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (RIA, rat-specific reagents
from NIDDK National Hormone and Pituitary Program), insulin-
like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (rat RIA, Diagnostic Systems
Laboratories, Inc.), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2
D] (RIA, DiaSorin),
17b-estradiol (RIA, MP Biomedicals), intact rat parathyroid
hormone (PTH) (two-site IRMA), osteocalcin (rat IRMA kit), and
total and free testosterone (EIA kits, ALPCO Diagnostics) were
determined by AnyLytics, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Urine pH,
sodium, potassium, glucose, creatinine, total ketone bodies,
calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and albumin were measured
using standard protocols of AnyLytics, Inc.
NHANES III data analysis
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) is a cross-sectional survey that yields nationally
representative health information on the civilian, noninstitutio-
nalized US population.(27,28) Owing to the increasing prevalence
of hyponatremia and osteoporosis with age and the demon-
strated ability of T-scores to predict fractures in persons over 50
years of age, we focused our analyses on NHANES III participants
aged 50 years and older. Subjects with hypo-and hypercalcemia
(<8 or >10.5 mg/dL), hypo-albuminuria (<3.0 g/dL), and ele-
vated serum creatinine (>4.0 mg/dL) were excluded from
analyses owing to the possibility that these characteristics
may have been related to an underlying comorbidity that might
affect bone density. We also excluded participants with
hypernatremia ([Naþ] > 145 mmol/L) because our interest was
in comparing hyponatremic subjects ([Naþ] < 135 mmol/L) with
those with normal [Naþ] values (135 > [Naþ] < 145 mmol/L).
Multiple linear regression models were created to determine if
there were linear associations between bone mineral density
(BMD) and serum [Naþ] between hyponatremic and normona-
tremic subjects. To test the null hypothesis that the odds of
having osteoporosis were the same in persons with normona-
tremia and hyponatremia, we also created two logistic regression
models, one for the total hip and one for the femoral neck. The
binary dependent variable represented the presence or absence
of osteoporosis based on the World Health Organization (WHO)
definition (site-specific T-score below ­2.5 SD), and the binary
independent variable of interest was the presence or absence of
hyponatremia. All models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass
index (BMI), physical activity, history of diuretic use, and serum
25(OH)D levels. Diuretics were used by 11.1% and 6.8% of
persons with hyponatremia and normonatremia, respectively. Of
these, thiazide diuretics were used by 10.5% and 4.7% of persons
with hyponatremia and normonatremia, respectively. Accord-
556 Journal of Bone and Mineral Research VERBALIS ET AL.
ingly, three ``dummy'' variables were created to adjust for use of
thiazide and nonthiazide diuretics relative to persons using no
diuretics. Dummy variables also were created to adjust for the
known effects of ethnicity on bone density (black versus white,
Mexican American versus white, and other versus white). The
final models indicated no difference in adjusted odds of
osteoporosis across categories of ethnicity or by smoking
history. Therefore, race and smoking were excluded from the
final models. There were no participants taking either selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephr-
ine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) in the hyponatremic subgroup,
and there were only 6 of 5598 participants (0.11%) in the
normonatremic subgroup. Alcohol use was not included in the
models because one-quarter of the sample was missing data for
this variable.
Statistical analysis
Rat study results are expressed as the mean Æ SEM. Statistical
significance was determined by analysis using Student's t test for
two-group comparison. Results from experiment 2 with four
groups were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by the Holme-Sidak test for multiple pairwise group
comparisons and for comparisons of multiple groups against a
control group when results of multiple comparisons displayed a
normal distribution and equal variance. When data were not
normally distributed (e.g., serum vitamin D metabolite concen-
trations), Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks
was used for evaluation, followed by multiple comparisons
against a control group using Dunn's method.
The NHANES III data were weighted to the civilian
noninstitutionalized population of the United States aged 50
years and older. Sample weights were used to adjust for unequal
probabilities of selection, oversampling, and nonresponse.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.1.3,
SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN (Version 9.0.1,
Research Triangle Institute) software.
Results
Hyponatremia reduces bone mass in rats
The animal model of SIADH developed in our laboratory (24)
employs administration of the vasopressin V2 receptor agonist
desmopressin to rats fed a liquid diet to induce water retention
and a dilutional hyponatremia. Previous results show that the
hyponatremia is maintained as long as the desmopressin
infusions and liquid diet feedings are continued.(29) Using this
protocol, plasma or serum [Naþ] levels were suppressed
equivalently at the end of 3 months in both experiments
(Table 1). Chronic hyponatremia did not cause observable
changes in the behavior and locomotive activity of the rats. There
were no significant differences in the weight gain or the final
weights between rats on solid and liquid diets and between
normonatremic and hyponatremic rats (Table 2).
We assessed long-term effects of hyponatremia on BMD,
trabecular and cortical bone volume, static and dynamic
histomorphometric parameters, and the serum and urinary
parameters of mineral metabolism and calcium regulating
hormones after 3 months of hyponatremia in two separate
experiments. The first experiment was designed to establish the
effect of sustained hyponatremia on bone mass, and the second
experiment was designed to reveal the effects of hyponatremia
separate from any potential effects on calcium metabolism.
Analyses of excised femurs using dual-energy X-ray absorp-
tiometry (DXA) from experiment 1 established that hypona-
tremia for 3 months significantly reduced BMD by approximately
30% (p < .001) compared with normonatremic rats receiving
desmopressin and the same diet in a solid form (Fig. 1A). This
finding was reproduced in experiment 2 relative to additional
control rats fed the liquid diet alone (see Fig. 1B).
More detailed analyses of bone architecture using mCT
measurements of excised femora also showed markedly
reduced bone mass in the hyponatremic groups, including
decline of both trabecular and cortical bone parameters
(Fig. 2A, B). Similarly, histology indicated that hyponatremia
reduced both trabecular and cortical bone contents (see
representative images of von Kossa­stained sections in Fig. 3).
Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that sections from
the femur, tibia, and spine of hyponatremic rats had reduced
BV/TV by 30% to 70%, trabecular number by 60% to 80%,
cortical thickness by 40­60% (p < .001 for each parameter),
and an approximately threefold increase in trabecular
separation compared with sections from normonatremic
control animals (p < .01). However, there were no differences
in the width of the growth plates, osteoid thickness, or osteoid
volume (data not shown).
The most striking histologic finding was that hyponatremia
increased the number of osteoclasts per bone area, defined as
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)­positive multinu-
cleated cells, by fivefold compared with normonatremic controls

(p < .001) in experiment 1 (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in experiment 2,
both osteoclast numbers per bone area and osteoclast surface
per bone surface were increased in both hyponatremic groups
compared with normonatremic controls (both p < .01; see
Fig. 4B). Indexes of bone formation did not show statistically
significant differences between groups, although there was
a tendency toward lower mineral apposition rate (MAR) and
bone-formation rate per trabecular bone surface (BFR/BS) in
hyponatremic rats compared with control groups (MAR: control
rats on solid diet with vitamin D treatment 1.27 Æ 0.21 mm/day
and on liquid diet 1.23 Æ 0.04 mm/day versus hyponatremic rats
0.64 Æ 0.3 mm/day; BFR/BS: control rats on solid diet with vitamin
D treatment 0.3 Æ 0.03 mm/day and on liquid diet
0.25 Æ 0.07 mm/day versus hyponatremic rats 0.17 Æ 0.09
m3/m2 per day). Mineralizing surface per bone surface in the
dynamic histomorphometry and osteoblast surface per bone
surface in the static histomorphometry did not show differences
between the control and hyponatremic groups.
Analyses of serum and urinary markers of renal and liver
functions and acid balance failed to reveal any consistent
abnormalities. All the rats on liquid diet had low levels of serum
vitamin D metabolites (both normal and hyponatremic)
(Table 2); these levels were more reduced in hyponatremic
than in normonatremic rats. Consistent with the reduced
serum 1,25(OH)2
D3
concentrations in hyponatremic rats, serum
calcium concentrations also were reduced in hyponatremic
rats in experiment 1 (9.8 Æ 0.2 mg/dL in hyponatremic versus
11.3 Æ 0.5 mg/dL in normonatremic; p < .001). However, these
reduced serum vitamin D metabolite levels did not increase
PTH levels in either experiment 1 or experiment 2 or
cause mineralization defects recognizable by bone histology.
Moreover, the difference in serum calcium concentrations in
experiment 2 were not statistically significant, the mean values
remained within normal ranges, and the urinary calcium
excretion was unaffected (see Table 2). Therefore, it appeared
to be unlikely that vitamin D deficiency was a significant factor
in the hyponatremia-induced reductions in bone mass.
Accordingly, treatment with vitamin D in experiment 2
increased serum 25(OH)D levels, urinary calcium excretion
also showed a trend to increase (but not statistically
significant), and serum PTH levels showed a trend to decrease
(but not statistically significant) in both the control and
hyponatremic animals and slightly reduced the degree of
reduction of bone mass (p < .05; see Fig. 1B).
The hyponatremic rats were found to have lower testosterone
and slightly elevated LH and FSH levels compared with
normonatremic controls in experiment 1 (free testoster-
one: control ¼ 13.1Æ 3.3pg/mL, hyponatremic ¼ 3.5Æ 0.8pg/mL,

(2.6 Æ 0.8 ng/mL) compared with normonatremic controls
(4.5 Æ 0.6 ng/mL) in experiment 2 (p < .05). This difference in
osteocalcin concentrations remained significant even in rats
treated with high doses of vitamin D (hyponatre-
mic ¼ 3.4 Æ 0.6 ng/mL; control ¼ 5.3 Æ 0.4 ng/mL; p < .05). Taken
together, the results indicate that hyponatremia increased bone
resorption and decreased bone formation, representing an
uncoupling of these two processes.

To address the potential clinical relevance of these findings from
animal studies, we analyzed human data from NHANES III. Along

with other parameters, NHANES III provides information on
sodium concentrations and BMD of the hip in a nationally
representative sample of US adults. The mean serum sodium
concentration of the hyponatremic cohort of NHANES III was in
the mildly hyponatremic range (133.0 Æ 0.2 mmol/L), in contrast
to our rat studies, in which the serum sodium levels were much
lower. The mean serum sodium concentration in the normona-
tremic subgroup was 141.4 Æ 0.1 mmol/L; the difference from the
hyponatremic group was statistically significant (p < .001).
Among NHANES III participants 50 years of age or older, a
statistically significant positive linear association between serum
[Naþ] and femoral neck BMD was observed in hyponatremic
subjects (p < .01) but not in normonatremic subjects (p ¼ .99).
Among hyponatremic subjects, serum [Naþ] explained 14.7% of
the variation in total hip BMD, and total hip BMD decreased by
0.037 g/cm2 for every 1 mmol/L decrease in serum [Naþ]. Similar
results were found for femoral neck BMD. The adjusted odds of
osteoporosis (BMD T-scores below ­2.5) were significantly higher
among participants with hyponatremia than among those with
normonatremia. At the femoral neck, the adjusted odds of
osteoporosis was 2.87 times higher among hyponatremic adults
[95% confidence interval (CI) ¼ 1.41­5.81; p ¼ .003]. A similar
association between hyponatremia and osteoporosis was noted
for total hip [odds ratio (OR) ¼ 2.85; 95% CI ¼ 1.03­0.86; p ¼ .043)
(Fig. 5).
There were no differences between the hyponatremic and
normonatremic subjects in mean age (hyponatremic
65.43 Æ 1.87 years, normonatremic 64.44 Æ 0.34 years;
p ¼ .6124), nutritional status (BMI: normonatremic 27.08 Æ 0.62,
hyponatremic 27.31 Æ 0.11; p ¼ .7157), serum 25(OH)D concen-
trations (hyponatremic 28.38 Æ 2.24 ng/mL, normonatremic
28.22 Æ 0.25 ng/mL; p ¼ .9443), or calcium concentrations (nor-
monatremic 9.24 Æ 0.07 mg/dL, hyponatremic 9.26 Æ 0.02 mg/
dL; p ¼ .8852).

Discussion
The studies presented here demonstrate that chronic hypona-
tremia significantly diminishes bone mass in an animal model of
the human disease of SIADH. It is particularly striking that the
30% reduction in BMD found in the hyponatremic rats is
approximately twice that reported in various well-established rat
osteoporosis models over similar periods of time using similar
densitometry methods, for example, 12­17% after ovariectomy
in female rats,(30,31) 6% after oophorectomy in male rats,(32) and
12% with vitamin D deficiency.(30) Thus chronic hyponatremia
represents a robust new animal model for the study of bone
mineral metabolism and osteoporosis.
Previous studies using the animal model of SIADH developed
in our laboratory have indicated that after several days of
sustained hyponatremia, cellular volume regulation is completed
in the brain,(14) after which longer-term compensatory mechan-
isms predominate. Owing to these compensatory mechanisms,
chronic hyponatremia in humans often remains clinically
``asymptomatic.'' This may explain why potential long-term
adverse effects have not been carefully evaluated in controlled
studies. However, recent reports have suggested that chronic
hyponatremia is associated with significant adverse neurologic
effects on cognitive function and gait stability and results in
higher frequency of falls.(33) A recent study from Belgian found
that mild asymptomatic hyponatremia was associated with
increased bone fracture incidence in ambulatory elderly
(adjusted OR ¼ 4.16; 95% CI 2.24­7.71),(34) but information on
BMD changes or potential metabolic consequences of hypona-
tremia have yet to be described. Our studies therefore represent
the first demonstration that chronic hyponatremia also causes
substantial metabolic effects in organs other than the brain.
Although several factors may contribute to the induced bone
loss seen with hyponatremia, the most notable is a marked
activation of osteoclastic bone resorption. This effect is
consistent with previous reports indicating that release of
stored sodium from bone requires resorptive activity. The
mechanisms of sodium sensing and sodium-concentration-
dependent activation of osteoclasts are not known and warrant
further studies. Another potential factor that may contribute to
the activation of osteoclastic bone resorption is hypogonadism.
Recent reports indicated that the increased FSH, although mild,
could contribute to increased bone resorption and bone loss to
some extent.(35) However, serum estradiol levels, which are felt to
represent the major factor associated with bone loss in
hypogonadal males,(36,37) were not significantly different
between the hyponatremic and control rats, and the decreased
bone-formation indexes argue against a high-turnover type of
osteopenia.
Mild vitamin D deficiency potentially would be consistent with
the decreased bone formation in this model. While vitamin D
levels are reduced in this model, replacement of vitamin D only
slightly decreased the hyponatremia-induced reductions in bone
mass in experiment 2. The lack of undermineralization by
histology supports the notion that vitamin D deficiency is not a
major mechanism responsible for the hyponatremia-induced
decline in BMD. Nonetheless, each of these factors will need to
be explored via further studies to fully understand the degree to
which they might contribute to the markedly reduced bone
density found with chronic hyponatremia.
Bone resorption is carried out by osteoclasts, a process that is
subject to regulation by hormones and cytokines. These factors
influence the number and activities of osteoclasts in concert with
activation of bone formation by osteoblasts. It is well known that
hormonal and metabolic changes can uncouple bone resorption
and formation, leading to bone loss and increased fragility.(38)
Accelerated osteoclastic bone resorption has a central role in the
pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis, a leading cause
of morbidity in individuals over the age of 60 years.(39) Correction
of hormonal abnormalities, calcium and vitamin D replacement,
and antiresorptive therapy can reduce bone loss and fracture risk
in over 50% of cases,(40) indicating the importance of identifying
and treating secondary causes of osteoporosis. If hyponatremia
represents an additional unrecognized risk factor for osteo-
porosis in humans, appropriate preventive and therapeutic
measures therefore would be warranted.
Cross-sectional data from NHANES III showing that hypona-
tremia is associated with significantly increased odds of
osteoporosis in humans support the experimental data in
rodents and suggest direct clinical implications for these
findings. However, it should be noted that the NHANES data
are cross-sectional, a design consideration that precludes our
findings from being interpreted in a causal framework. None-
theless, the NHANES data clearly show strong, consistent
associations between hyponatremia and osteoporosis at the
femoral neck and total hip. These results were adjusted for a
number of factors that are known to be strongly and causally
associated with osteoporosis, further suggesting an independent
role for hyponatremia in osteoporosis. Our results apply only to
adults aged 50 years and older without hyper- or hypocalcemia
and without elevated serum creatinine because these were
selection criteria for inclusion in the analysis sample. Although
these exclusions reduce the generalizability of results to a certain
degree, our exclusion criteria represent acceptable tradeoffs with
respect to identifying a clinically relevant age group for studies of
novel risk factors for osteoporosis and to ensuring exclusion of
persons with clinical profiles that could be consistent with
underlying comorbidities affecting bone density. Despite these
exclusions, the consistent associations between hyponatremia
and osteoporosis in the NHANES analysis are not only
noteworthy, but they are also generalizeable to adults nation-
wide who share clinical characteristics similar to those examined
in this report.
Although hyponatremia may engage common pathways as
other causes of osteoporosis, hyponatremia-induced bone
resorption and osteoporosis are unique in that they represent
attempts of the body to preserve sodium homeostasis at the
expense of bone structural integrity. It is of interest that a
decreased extracellular sodium concentration may represent the
signal to mobilize bone stores of sodium via bone matrix
resorption. This would explain previous data that low-sodium
diets are not associated with osteoporosis (41) because serum
sodium concentrations generally are maintained within normal
ranges despite wide variations in sodium intake. Consequently,
our results suggest that hyponatremia, rather than dietary
sodium intake, represents a significant, previously unrecognized
HYPONATREMIA-INDUCED OSTEOPOROSIS Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 561
risk factor for the development of osteoporosis. Based on these
findings in rats in association with our analysis of human data
from NHANES III, we recommend that bone quality should be
assessed in all patients with chronic hyponatremia and
appropriate treatment initiated where indicated.
While the incidence of osteoporosis solely owing to
hyponatremia is likely relatively small, its true clinical significance
lies in the likelihood that even mild chronic hyponatremia might
act additively or synergistically with other causes of bone loss
that occur commonly with aging, thereby contributing to
morbidity and mortality in this increasing segment of the
population. Whether activation of similar metabolic pathways in
other cells and tissues might explain the well-known association
between hyponatremia and poor clinical outcome across a wide
variety of different disease processes,(1) and potentially even
accelerate the aging process itself, remains intriguing possibi-
lities for future research.
