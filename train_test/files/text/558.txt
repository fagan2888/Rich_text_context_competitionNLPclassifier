Importance: Animal studies have suggested that pre-
natal cocaine exposure (PCE) deleteriously influences the
developing nervous system, in part attributable to its site
of action in blocking the function of monoamine reup-
take transporters, increasing synaptic levels of seroto-
nin and dopamine.
Objective: To examine the brain morphologic features
and associated impulsive behaviors in adolescents fol-
lowing prenatal exposure to cocaine and/or tobacco.
Design: Magnetic resonance imaging data and behav-
ioral measures were collected from adolescents fol-
lowed up longitudinally in the Maternal Lifestyle Study.
Setting: A hospital-based research center.
Participants: A total of 40 adolescent participants aged
13 to 15 years were recruited, 20 without PCE and 20
with PCE; a subset of each group additionally had to-
bacco exposure. Participants were selected and matched
based on head circumference at birth, gestational age, ma-
ternal alcohol use, age, sex, race/ethnicity, IQ, family pov-
erty, and socioeconomic status.
Main Outcome Measures: Subcortical volumetric mea-
sures of the thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hip-
pocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens; cortical
thickness measures of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
and ventral medial prefrontal cortex; and impulsivity as-
sessed by Conners' Continuous Performance Test and the
Sensation Seeking Scale for Children.
Results: After controlling for covariates, cortical thick-
ness of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was sig-
nificantly thinner in adolescents following PCE (P=.03),
whereas the pallidum volume was smaller in adolescents
following prenatal tobacco exposure (P=.03). Impulsiv-
ity was correlated with thalamic volume following either
PCE (P=.05) or prenatal tobacco exposure (P=.04).
Conclusions and Relevance: Prenatal cocaine or to-
bacco exposure can differentially affect structural brain
maturation during adolescence and underlie enhanced
susceptibility to impulsivity. Additional studies with larger
sample sizes are warranted.

ANIMAL STUDIES HAVE SUG-
gested that prenatal co-
caine exposure (PCE) ex-
erts deleterious influences
on the developing ner-
vous system, in part attributable to its site
of action in blocking the function of mono-
amine reuptake transporters, increasing
synaptic levels of serotonin and dopa-
mine. Nonhuman primate models have
shown harmful effects of PCE on neuro-
nal proliferation, migration, maturation,
and synaptogenesis, leading to disrup-
tions of cortical lamination and signifi-
cant neuron loss in exposed offspring.1,2
Human structural magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) studies have begun to iden-
tify possible anatomic deficits following
PCE. Decreased head circumference, cor-
tical gray matter, and total parenchymal
volume were found in 10-year-old to 14-
year-old children following PCE.3 Avants
et al4 noted that the caudate nucleus, a re-
gion rich in dopaminergic innervation, ex-
hibited diminished volume bilaterally in
adolescents following PCE. Preliminary re-
sults from the Maternal Lifestyle Study
(MLS) have shown volumetric decreases
in the cortical gray matter, thalamus, and
putamen following PCE.5

One confounding factor in the study of PCE is that
most PCE offspring are subject to gestational exposure
to other substances of abuse, most notably tobacco.6 Stud-
ies have demonstrated that prenatal tobacco exposure
(PTE) might independently contribute to abnormalities
in brain structures and impairments in brain growth.7,8
Nicotine, the psychoactive ingredient in tobacco, binds
to nicotinic receptors in the brain, which, like cocaine,
enhances synaptic levels of dopamine. However, the site
and mechanism of action of these addictive drugs are dis-
tinct. Thinner cortex has been reported in the orbitofron-
tal and middle frontal cortical areas in adolescents follow-
ing PTE.9 In a cohort of children exposed to cocaine and
tobacco, an association was observed between PTE vs PCE
contributing to reduced cortical gray matter volume, un-
derlying the importance of distinguishing the indepen-
dent and, in many cases, combined PCE/PTE effects.3
Prenatal cocaine exposure/PTE has been found to be
associated with a wide spectrum of behavioral problems
characterized by deficits in impulsivity, inhibitory con-
trol, and self-regulation. Dennis et al10 reported that co-
caine-exposed boys, who were studied at an average age
of 4.5 years, were more likely to express frustration and
had more difficulty in controlling their frustration in a
problem-solving task. In one study of 6-year-old chil-
dren, those with PCE experienced increased symptoms
of oppositional defiant disorder and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, consistent with the report of more
behavioral problems from caregivers.11 Results from the
MLS indicate that PCE increases the prevalence of ex-
ternalizing behavioral problems from age 7 years through
periadolescence, and affected children are more likely to
require special education services at ages 7 and 11 years.12
However, there has been little information regarding
the long-term effects of prenatal drug exposure on brain/
behavior changes during adolescence. A major concern
stems from whether an enduring effect of prenatal drug
exposure would compromise adolescent brain develop-
ment, as the latter represents an additional critical period
of neural plasticity, particularly for the frontal lobe devel-
opment.13 Mostsubcorticalandmanycorticalregionsreach
their peak growth periods during the first decade, and they
experience volumetric reductions and decreases in corti-
cal thickness during adolescence, leading to an inverted
U-shaped curve characterizing progressive followed by re-
gressivebraingrowth.14,15 However,structuralmaturation
of the frontal lobe peaks during the second decade, and it
is thought to underlie the maturation of associated behav-
iors subserved by that region.16,17 Specifically, the transi-
tionthroughadolescenceencompassesmultipleadaptations

and risk taking are evident in a variety of species.18-20 Most
importantly,withstructuralremodelingoffrontallobecir-
cuitry during adolescence, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is

tative role of PFC­basal ganglia systems in mediating be-
havioral regulation, synchronization between subcortical
basalgangliaregionsandthePFCarepresumedtosubstan-
tially influence the evolution of adolescent behaviors.21
Based on the fact that the highest concentration of
dopamine in the cortex is in the frontal lobe and sub-
cortically in the basal ganglia, we would expect struc-
tural deficits in PCE adolescents to be observed in the
PFC­basal ganglia system. Our hypothesis was that PCE
would be related to smaller volumes of subcortical re-
gions and a thinner prefrontal cortex. We hypothesized
that PTE would impair brain growth of a similar, al-
though nonidentical, set of brain structures and cir-
cuits. We also hypothesized that structural deficits in PCE
and PTE adolescents would be related to more impul-
sivity based on behavioral measures of poor inhibitory
control.
METHODS
SUBJECTS
Adolescents (aged 13-15 years) were recruited from the Provi-
dence site of the MLS, which is an ongoing longitudinal study
of children with PCE; recruitment criteria have been de-
scribed elsewhere.22 Prenatal cocaine exposure was deter-
mined by self-report of cocaine use during pregnancy and/or a
positive meconium assay result for cocaine metabolites. Twenty
participants with PCE and 20 with no PCE (NPCE) were se-
lected and matched based on head circumference at birth, ges-
tational age, maternal alcohol use, age, sex, race/ethnicity, IQ,
family poverty, and socioeconomic status. Additional exclu-
sion criteria included (1) intrauterine exposure to opiates or
marijuana, (2) gestational age less than 33 weeks, (3) IQ scores
less than 70 at 10 years of age, and (4) females with a positive
pregnancy test result. Institutional review board­approved con-
sent forms were obtained in the study.
STRUCTURAL IMAGING ACQUISITION
AND ANALYSIS
Structural MRI data were acquired using the volumetric mag-
netization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) T1-
weighted sequence run on a 3-T Siemens TIM Trio scanner (Sie-
mens Medical Solutions). The parameters for the MPRAGE pulse
sequence were repetition time of 2250 milliseconds, echo time
of 2.98 milliseconds, inversion time of 900 milliseconds, flip
angle of 9, field of view of 256256 mm2, slice thickness of 1
mm, and resolution of 111 mm.
To reconstruct brain morphologic features, the 3-dimen-
sional MPRAGE data were processed via the Freesurfer soft-
ware package version 4.0.5 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard
.edu) using an automated pipeline custom developed for an
XNAT-based DICOM server hosted at Weill Cornell Medical
College of Cornell University (https://ped-birn.med.cornell
.edu/xnat/). Details of the Freesurfer image analysis algo-
rithms have been described in prior publications.23,24 In brief,
after implementation of motion correction, white matter vox-
els were first identified to establish the gray-white matter in-
terface as the starting point for cortical segmentation. Subse-
quently, a deformable surface algorithm was applied to construct
the pial surface with submillimeter precision.24 Segmentation
required the use of a set of priors in the form of an atlas, which
guided the identification of specific brain structures based on
location, tissue type, and local spatial configuration.25 The out-
put was visually reviewed and topologic inaccuracies were manu-
ally corrected. Each reconstructed brain was registered to a com-
mon spherical representation coordinate system to align sulcal
and gyral characteristics across subjects.26 Parcellation of spe-
cific cortical areas was based on the scheme developed by Desi-
kan et al23 and allowed for calculations of the mean thickness.
For each point on the gray-white matter boundary, the short-

est distance to the pial surface was calculated. In the same way,
the shortest distance from every point on the pial surface to
the gray-white matter boundary was also measured. Cortical
thickness estimates were defined as the average of these 2 dis-
tances.24 Freesurfer's segmentation and parcellation approach
has been shown to be robust to intensity overlap between dif-
ferent cortical structures and comparable with manual label-
ing in accuracy.23,27,28 We have extended that comparison by
demonstrating the enhanced validity of using a set of manu-
ally edited pediatric priors for developmental studies.29
BEHAVIORAL DATA
Conners' Continuous Performance Test II is a computerized
task administered at the 13-year visit and used to evaluate im-
pulsivity. The stimuli of bold-faced letters were presented uni-
formly for 250 milliseconds on a computer screen, while in-
terstimulus interval varied at 1, 2, and 4 seconds at random
intervals. Participants were required to respond to the appear-
ance of any letter other than the target letter X by clicking a
mouse button or pushing the space bar and to withdraw the
response when an X was displayed. The commission error,
defined as "a ratio of the subject's incorrect response to non-
targets as to the actual number of non-targets presented mi-
nus the number of anticipatory responses towards non-
targets,"30 was the raw score measure of impulsivity, which was
then transformed to a T score based on a nonclinical norm.31
The Sensation Seeking Scale for Children collected at the
10-year visit is a 28-item self-report scale measuring motiva-
tion for irregularity and adventure.32,33 Each question de-
scribed a real-life situation and participants had to choose a sen-
sation-seeking­oriented response or not. A higher summary
score suggested stronger inclination for impulsivity.34
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Stata version 10.0 (StataCorp) was used for statistical analy-
sis. Independent t test, 2 test, or Fisher exact test was used, as
appropriate, to examine group differences of demographic char-
acteristics. Morphometric data derived from Freesurfer analy-
ses for which most values were more than 2 standard devia-
tions from the mean were considered outliers and such data
were eliminated from further analyses. For subcortical mor-
phometric analyses, volumes were highly correlated between
the 2 hemispheres. Therefore, the average of each subcortical
structure was calculated and used for subsequent analyses, in-
cluding the thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocam-
pus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. Subcortical volumes
of PCE subjects were compared with those of NPCE subjects
after controlling for intracranial volume (ICV) and PTE. In ad-
dition, to examine PTE effects, a similar analysis was con-
ducted between PTE and non-PTE (NPTE), while controlling
for the ICV and PCE. Based on a priori hypothesis, cortical thick-
ness measures from the set of regions comprising the frontal
lobe, including the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC, rostral middle
frontal cortex) and ventral medial PFC (VMPFC, medial orbi-
tofrontal cortex), known to be typically involved in behav-
ioral regulation,35 were extracted from the full data set. To test
the unique effect of PCE on cortical thickness, analysis of co-
variance was applied to detect regional thickness differences
of DLPFC and VMPFC between PCE and NPCE after adjust-
ing for average cortical thickness and PTE. To examine PTE
effects, a similar analysis was conducted between PTE and NPTE
while controlling for average cortical thickness and PCE. In ad-
dition, linear regression (Pearson r) was used to evaluate the
association between specific brain morphologic measures and
behavioral performance on both Conners' Continuous Perfor-
mance Test and the Sensation Seeking Scale for Children.
RESULTS
PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS
Among the 20 PCE subjects, 15 also had PTE; there were
8 with PTE among the 20 NPCE subjects. Demographic
information for both the PCE and PTE cohorts (Table 1)
showed that the exposed and corresponding compari-
son subjects were comparable with respect to all demo-
graphic variables analyzed.

markedly abnormal values, and was eliminated from all
subsequent analyses. After adjustment for both ICV and
PTE (Table 2), pallidum approached statistical signifi-
cance, with PCE subjects showing relatively larger vol-
umes (P = .06). After controlling for ICV and PCE, PTE
subjects exhibited significantly smaller pallidum (P = .03).
The cortical thickness estimate for the right DLPFC was
significantly reduced in PCE compared with NPCE sub-
jects (mean [SD], 2.18 [0.15] mm vs 2.30 [0.14] mm;
P = .03), an effect that was not evident in the left hemi-
sphere (Figure 1). Both DLPFC and VMPFC did not
demonstrate a significant effect of PTE on cortical thick-
ness (DLPFC: right hemisphere, P = .80, left hemi-
sphere, P = .66; VMPFC: right hemisphere, P = .14, left
hemisphere, P = .40).
BRAIN/BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS
On the Sensation Seeking Scale for Children, more im-
pulsivity was related to a larger thalamus in exposed sub-
jects in both the PCE (PCE: r = 0.47, P = .05; NPCE:
r = 0.35, P = .14) and PTE (PTE: r = 0.44, P = .04; NPTE:
r = 0.22, P = .41) groups (Figure 2 and Figure 3, re-
spectively). Correlations between Conners' Continuous
Performance Test commission errors and caudate vol-
ume were of borderline significance in the PCE group
(PCE: r = 0.44, P = .06; control: r = 0.10, P = .68).
COMMENT
We found thinning of the right DLPFC in adolescents
with PCE and a decrease in the volume of pallidum in
children with PTE. In addition, in both PCE and PTE, a
larger thalamus was related to behavioral impulsivity.
Surprisingly, our finding of a lack of overall volumet-
ric differences in subcortical regions in 13-year-old to 15-
year-old PCE adolescents is not consistent with prior re-
ports of smaller caudate, putamen, and thalamus in studies
of 8-year-old to 10-year-old PCE children.4,5 These dif-
ferences could be attributable to differences in imaging
parameters and, in some reports, a consequence of not
controlling for prenatal exposures to other substances.
However, the discrepancy between preadolescence and
adolescence could result from a supranormal adoles-
cent brain growth spurt and delayed pruning of redun-

dant neuronal connections independently or together.
It remains to be determined whether narrowing volu-
metric difference results from full catch-up brain
growth or is a new feature of diverted development
unique to adolescence. Our results support the concept
that prenatal drug exposure changes brain development
trajectories in a structure-specific pattern that plays out
differentially during the second decade, a hypothesis
that requires confirmation via future studies with itera-
tive image acquisitions.
To our knowledge, this is the first study of cortical
thinning in cocaine-exposed offspring. This result re-
mained significant after further adjustment for age or sex.
Our result is consistent with neuroimaging data docu-
menting sustained changes in the brain, including the
DLPFC, in adults following chronic cocaine abuse. Ana-
tomically, evidence has shown reduced cortical volume
and gray matter density in the DLPFC of cocaine-
dependent subjects.36,37 In addition, reduced cerebral glu-
cose metabolism, N-acetylaspartate level, and cerebral hy-
poperfusion have been noted in the brains of adult cocaine
addicts.38-40 As for the right DLPFC, positron-emission
tomography studies have shown that active cocaine us-
ers have reduced activation of this area in both the Stroop
and the Iowa Gambling tasks.41,42 Of note, one func-
tional MRI study of an overlapping subset of the MLS sub-
jects, albeit 3 years younger, illustrated elevated brain ac-
tivation in the right frontal cortex in the PCE group when
executing a go/no go task.43 Taken together, the combi-
nation of structural and functional imaging data pointed
to the DLPFC as one cortical region selectively vulner-
able to the effects of repeated cocaine exposure. How-
ever, in adult drug addicts, it is not known whether this
is a preexisting cortical alteration in the DLPFC or whether
changes are the consequences of cocaine addiction. There-
fore, we cannot identify whether the thinner right DLPFC
evident in the PCE group is a biomarker for adolescents
at greater risk for drug experimentation or addiction.
The finding of smaller pallidum in PTE adolescents
matches decreased striatal volume from previous to-
bacco studies.3,44 While both drugs have numerous sites
and mechanisms of action, PTE effects have been pre-
sumed to originate from diversified compositions of nico-
tinic cholinergic receptor systems in the regionally hetero-
geneous distribution pattern.45 In addition, multiple
neurotransmitter systems, including noradrenergic,
gamma-aminobutyric acidergic, and serotonergic signal-
ing, are likely involved in PTE effects as well.46 There-
fore, the nicotine-mediated dopamine release in the
striatum, individually or in concert with other neurotrans-
mitter systems, might mediate PTE effects on subcorti-
cal structures. We did not find PTE-related thickness
changes in the frontal cortical areas we studied. Toro and
colleagues9 reported thinner lateral orbitofrontal and cau-
dal middle frontal cortex in female adolescents with PTE.
Toro and colleagues' study had a much larger sample size
than ours but no information regarding cocaine history
was specified or controlled for.
The association between adolescent impulsivity and
alterations in brain structures has rarely been exam-
ined. We found positive correlations of volumetric mea-
sures and impulsivity in the thalamus for both the PCE
and PTE groups. Closely interconnected with the PFC
and basal ganglia, the thalamus is the relay center in
integrating and gating sensory information, guiding at-
tentional control, and coordinating behavioral re-
sponses.47,48 Prior evidence has shown decreased resting-
state cerebral blood flow in the thalamus of adolescents
with PCE.49 The association between thalamic volume
and impulsivity can suggest one liability for compro-
mised top-down control over impulsivity. Future stud-
ies are needed to examine the relationship between im-
pulsivity and specific thalamic subnuclei. On the other
hand, no significant correlation was observed between
cortical thickness and behavioral impulsivity. Because par-
ticipants were in early adolescence, it was uncertain to
what extent the maturation of cortical circuitry had been
completed, creating the possibility that a more robust as-
sociation might surface during late adolescence when the
PFC is taking on a leading role of executive function.

One strength of our design was dissecting the impact
of prenatal drug exposure from other confounding vari-
ables by matching exposed and comparison subjects on
potential confounding variables in advance. Still, our re-
sults should be interpreted with caution. First, our con-
clusions are based on a modest sample size of affected
adolescents. Replications in future studies with larger
sample sizes are warranted. Second, the MR-based brain
imaging methods we used solely assessed brain volume,
and they were not reflective of the cellular makeup of the
brain structures we studied. Third, dichotomized indi-
ces of prenatal drug exposure preclude any dose-
response analyses in brain morphometry. Fourth, our find-
ings become less pronounced after accounting for multiple
comparisons, especially in subcortical regions. It raises
another viable possibility that brain morphometry was
indeed comparable between exposed and unexposed ado-
lescents. Deficits observed at early stages presumably di-
minished along with brain development. There may still
be subtle deficits, but at a functional level, in the ab-
sence of overt morphometric deficits. While most PCE/
PTE studies have focused on brain or behavioral altera-
tions in infants and preschoolers, the potential enduring
effects on adolescence should be addressed in future stud-
ies in light of our current findings.
