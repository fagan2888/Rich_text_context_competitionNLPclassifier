Objective: To characterize national trends in non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injury rates for persons
aged 19 years or younger in relation to trends in non-fatal and fatal firearm related injury rates and
discuss these trends in light of injury prevention and violence prevention efforts.
Setting: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) includes approximately 100 hos-
pitals with at least six beds that provide emergency services. These hospitals comprise a stratified prob-
ability sample of all US hospitals with emergency departments. The National Vital Statistics System
(NVSS) is a complete census of all death certificates filed by states and is compiled annually.
Methods: National data on BB/pellet gun related injuries and injury rates were examined along with
fatal and non-fatal firearm related injuries and injury rates. Non-fatal injury data for all BB/pellet gun
related injury cases from 1985 through 1999, and firearm related injury cases from 1993 through
1999 were obtained from hospital emergency department records using the NEISS. Firearm related
deaths from 1985 through 1999 were obtained from the NVSS.
Results: BB/pellet gun related injury rates increased from age 3 years to a peak at age 13 years and
declined thereafter. In contrast, firearm related injury and death rates increased gradually until age 13
and then increased sharply until age 18 years. For persons aged 19 years and younger, BB/pellet gun
related injury rates increased from the late 1980s until the early 1990s and then declined until 1999;
these injury rates per 100 000 population were 24.0 in 1988, 32.8 in 1992, and 18.3 in 1999. This
trend was similar to those for fatal and non-fatal firearm related injury rates per 100 000 which were
4.5 in 1985, 7.8 in 1993, and 4.3 in 1999 (fatal) and 38.6 in 1993 and 16.3 in 1999 (non-fatal).
In 1999, an estimated 14 313 (95% confidence interval (CI) 12 025 to 16 601) cases with non-fatal
BB/pellet gun injuries and an estimated 12 748 (95% CI 7881­17 615) cases with non-fatal firearm
related injuries among persons aged 19 years and younger were treated in US hospital emergency
departments.
Conclusions: BB/pellet gun related and firearm related injury rates show similar declines since the
early 1990s. These declines coincide with a growing number of prevention efforts aimed at reducing
injuries to children from unsupervised access to guns and from youth violence. Evaluations at the state
and local level are needed to determine true associations.
BB and pellet gun related injuries represent an important
public health concern in the US,especially for children and
teenagers. A previous study reported that children and
teenagers account for about 80% of all non-fatal BB/pellet gun
related injuries.1 In the early 1990s,an estimated 23 500 persons
aged 19 years or younger were treated annually for non-fatal
BB/pellet gun related injuries in US hospital emergency
departments.2 Although a majority of these injuries in children
and teenagers resulted from unintentional shootings, at least
10% of them were from interpersonal or self directed
violence.2 This is in contrast to fatal and non-fatal firearm
related injuries which are predominantly violence related.3 4
An estimated 3.2 million BB/pellet guns are sold in the US
each year. Eighty per cent of these guns have muzzle velocities
greater than 350 feet per second (fps) and 50% have velocities
between 500 fps and 930 fps.2 5 At close range, BBs and pellets
fired from these air powered guns, especially those with
velocities >350 fps, can cause tissue damage similar to that
inflicted by powder charged bullets fired from small caliber
handguns.6 Numerous studies have documented the poten-
tially severe or lethal nature of penetrating injuries from
BB/pellet gunshots, especially those to the abdomen, chest,
eye, and head of children. These studies indicate that
unsupervised access to these guns by children is a major risk
factor for injury.5 7­10 To reduce the risk of disability and death
of patients inflicted with such wounds, some hospitals and
doctors have modified their trauma care protocols to account
for potentially severe, penetrating injuries from these com-
pressed air powered guns.10­12
This study presents nationally representative data on trends
in non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injury rates for persons aged
19 years and younger and compares these trends with national
trends in fatal and non-fatal firearm related injury rates.
National data are used to examine trends in gun related injury
and death rates from 1985 through 1999, and to characterize
these injuries by age, sex, race/ethnicity, intent of injury, and
disposition at emergency department discharge. National data
on BB/pellet gun related deaths were not included in our
analysis because these deaths are coded in "other specified"
categories and, therefore, cannot be uniquely identified using
the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9),
external cause of injury coding system.13
METHODS
Data on non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries and non-fatal
firearm related injuries were obtained using National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) operated by the US

Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Data from 1985
through 1992 on BB/pellet gun injuries were collected as part of
CPSC's routine surveillance of consumer product related injuries
using NEISS. Data from 1993 through 1999 on non-fatal
BB/pellet gun related injuries and non-fatal firearm related inju-
ries were collected through a "special study" using NEISS.14 This
special study was implemented through an interagency agree-
ment between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and CPSC to collect more detailed information about the
circumstances of all gun related injury incidents.14
A BB/pellet gun related injury was defined as a gunshot
wound from a pistol or rifle that uses compressed air to fire a
metal BB or pellet. These guns can operate through a spring or
pump action mechanism or a carbon dioxide cartridge.15 A fire-
arm related injury was defined as a gunshot wound from a pis-
tol, revolver, or rifle that uses a powder charge to fire a projectile.
The NEISS is comprised of approximately 100 hospitals
selected as a stratified probability sample of the approximately
5000 hospitals with emergency departments located through-
out the US.16 17 The system includes very large inner city hospi-
tals with trauma centers, as well as urban, suburban, rural, and
children's hospitals. Data obtained from these NEISS hospitals
were weighted by the inverse of the probability of selection to
provide national estimates of injuries treated in hospital emer-
gency departments in the US and its territories.17 NEISS on-site
personnel at each hospital were trained to identify all gun
related cases treated in the emergency department by reviewing
emergency department logs, trauma registries (when avail-
able), and emergency department charts. Based on information
written in the medical record, on-site personnel classified gun
related injuries by type of weapon (BB/pellet gun or firearm).
For each BB/pellet gun related case from 1985 through 1992,
coders abstracted information from the medical record on age
and sex of the patient, nature of the injury, primary body part
injured, disposition at discharge from the emergency depart-
ment. For each special study gun related case treated from 1993
through 1999, coders abstracted those routine NEISS variables
plus race/ethnicity of the patient, method of transport to the
emergency department, type of firearm used, victim-offender
relationship, intent of injury (for example, unintentional,
suspected and confirmed assault, suspected and confirmed sui-
cide attempt, law enforcement related), and other selected fac-
tors. A narrative taken verbatim from the medical record was
also captured to provide more details about the injury
circumstances. Further details of the system, abstraction meth-
ods, and evaluations of case ascertainment and completeness
and accuracy of coding are provided elsewhere.18­20
In 1997, the sampling frame of NEISS was updated and a
stratum was added for children's hospitals increasing the
number of NEISS hospitals from 91 to 101.17 During an eight
month overlap in 1997, gunshot cases were collected from
both the old and new NEISS samples. Analysis of the
weighted data indicated that differences in national estimates
of non-fatal firearm related injuries based on these two sam-
ples were minimal (that is, <1%). However, differences in
national estimates of non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries
were relatively high (that is, <15%) and depended on age. To
account for this, a SAS program developed by CPSC was used
to calculate ratios for adjusting both firearm related and
BB/pellet gun related injuries. These ratios were then applied
to sample weights for NEISS cases before 1997 to ensure com-
parability of national estimates over time.
In cases before 1993, there was no way of distinguishing
non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries associated with
gunshot wounds from those induced by other causes (for
example, lacerating or pinching finger on trigger after a fall).
In the special study cases treated from 1993 through 1999, 4%
were determined to be non-gunshot wounds. Accordingly,
rates calculated for the earlier years were adjusted downward
by 4% to account for non-gunshot wound cases.
Race and ethnicity data for persons treated for non-fatal
gun related injuries were obtained from NEISS hospital emer-
gency department records. The majority of cases were reported
as either white, black, Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian*.
Those reported as black Hispanic were classified as black, and
those reported as any other race and Hispanic were classified
as Hispanic.3 Because of the small numbers of cases,

Information about fatal firearm related injuries from 1985
through 1999 was obtained from the National Vital Statistics
System (NVSS) of Center for Disease Control and Prevention's
National Center for Health Statistics. The NVSS provides a
complete enumeration of all deaths in the US.21 For this study,
all firearm related deaths of residents of the US with an ICD-9
underlying cause of death code of E922.0­E922.9, E955.0­
E955.4, E965.0­E965.4, E985.0­E985.4, or E970 were
included.13 Annual population estimates of the resident popu-
lation, used to calculate injury and death rates per 100 000
population, are from the US Census Bureau.
The 95% confidence intervals (CI) around national esti-
mates of numbers and rates were calculated using a direct
variance estimation procedure that accounts for sample
weights and the stratified sample design.16 Linear regression
was used to calculate the percentage decline in fatal and non-
fatal gun related rates from the early 1990s through 1999. The
95% CI calculated for these percentage declines also accounted
for the sample weights and stratified sample design.
RESULTS
From 1993 through 1999, an estimated 122 068 persons (95%
CI 105 275 to 138 861) aged 19 years or younger with
non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries were treated in US
hospital emergency departments. This represents an annual
average of 17 438 persons ranging from 22 598 in 1993 to
14 313 in 1999. These estimates were based on data obtained

from 3076 sample persons using NEISS. The non-fatal
BB/pellet gun related injury rate was highest for persons
10­14 years of age (table 1). Among this age group, the non-
fatal BB/pellet gun related injury rate was 3.8 times the non-
fatal firearm related injury rate and 17.3 times the fatal fire-
arm related injury rate (48.4 v 12.6 and 2.8 per 100 000).
Similar to firearm related injuries and deaths, non-fatal
BB/pellet gun related injuries predominantly occurred among
males (86.7%; 95% CI 74.5% to 98.9%). The non-fatal
BB/pellet gun related injury rate was similar for non-Hispanic
whites and blacks, 24.1 and 28.4 per 100 000, in contrast to
firearm related injury and death rates which were much
higher among black than white persons, 94.8 and 8.3 per
100 000 for injuries and 16.7 and 3.4 per 100 000 for deaths.
The BB/pellet gun related injury rate for Hispanics (9.0 per
100 000) was about one third of the rate for non-Hispanic
whites and blacks.
The age distributions differed for BB/pellet gun related
injury rates and firearm related injury and death rates (fig 1).
BB/pellet gun related injury rates increased sharply after age 7
years, peaked at age 13 years, and then declined thereafter.
Firearm related injury and death rates increased gradually
until age 13 years and then increased sharply until age 18
years.
Comparisons of non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries
with firearm related injuries and deaths for selected charac-
teristics also showed notable differences (table 2). While a
majority of non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries were
unintentional (65.8%; 95% CI 56.0% to 75.7%), firearm
related injuries and deaths were mostly assaults (64.3%; 95%
CI 35.5% to 93.1% for injuries and 61.5%; 95% CI 61.0% to
62.0% for deaths). Although the number of violence related
injuries associated with BB/pellet guns, including assaults
and suicide attempts, was relatively small, the percentage of
violence related injuries increased with age (fig 2). This find-
ing was consistent with an increase in the percentage of vio-
lence related firearm related injuries and deaths by age (fig
2).
When compared with non-fatal firearm related injuries
(table 2), non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries were 12
times less likely to result in hospitalization (3.8%; 95% CI 2.7%
to 5.0% compared with 46.2%; 95% CI 23.1% to 69.3%). Com-
pared with those who survived a firearm injury to the facial
area and were treated in a hospital emergency department,
non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries occurred three times
more often to the face (15.4%; 95% CI 12.6% to 18.1%
compared with 5.2%; 95% CI 3.5% to 7.0%) and almost 12
times more likely to involve an eye (5.9%; 95% CI 4.6% to 7.3%
compared with 0.5%; 95% CI 0.2% to 0.7%).
Comparison of trends in BB/pellet gun related injury rates
with firearm related injury and death rates showed similar
patterns over the 12 year period from 1988 through 1999 (fig
3). BB/pellet gun injury rates increased from 1988 through
1992 and then declined thereafter; the predicted per cent
change from 1992 through 1999 was -38.8% (95% CI -48.0%
to -29.5%). Non-fatal firearm related injury rates declined
steadily from 1993 through 1999; the predicted per cent
change from 1993 through 1999 was -55.0% (95% CI -60.1%
to -49.8%). Firearm related death rates increased from 1985
through 1993 and then declined steadily after 1994; the
predicted per cent change from 1994 through 1999 was
-45.2% (95% CI -48.2% to -42.1%) .
DISCUSSION
BB/pellet gun related injuries and their potentially harmful
and lethal effects have been well documented in the medical
literature since the early 1980s.6 12 14­23 BB/pellet gunshot
wounds, particularly those inflicted at close range, can
penetrate the abdomen, chest, head, and eye, and cause
permanent damage and death.10 24­26 Most of these injuries
occurred in children and teenagers aged 19 years or younger.
Based on NEISS data for the most current year available, 1999,
almost 76% of 18 911 all persons with BB/pellet gun related
injuries treated in US hospital emergency departments were
19 years of age or younger.
Trend analyses indicated that BB/pellet gun related
injury rates for persons aged 19 years or younger declined

39% from 1992 through 1999. In 1999, an estimated 14 313
(95% CI 12 025 to 16 601) children and teenagers with
BB/pellet gun related injuries compared with an estimated
12 748 (95% CI 7881 to 17 615) cases with non-fatal firearm
related injuries were treated in US hospital emergency
departments. NVSS data for 1999 indicated that 3385 persons
19 years of age or younger died from firearm related injuries,
second only to motor vehicle traffic related injuries (7476
persons) as the leading cause of death in this age range in the
US.
The ICD, the classification system used by the NVSS to code
deaths, does not have external cause of injury codes to
specifically identify BB/pellet gun related deaths.13 However,
CPSC has an extensive consumer product related injury
tracking system for use in identifying BB/pellet gun related
deaths that occur each year. CPSC's system documented 57
deaths of persons aged 17 years or younger (or 3.8 deaths per
year) from 1985 through 1999 (unpublished data from
CPSC's In-Depth Investigation, Injury or Potential Injury
Incident, and NEISS files). The highest number of deaths

occurred in 1989, 1990, and 1991 (seven, 12, and seven
deaths); the number of deaths ranged from one to four in
other years (fig 4).
The decline in BB/pellet gun related injury rates was similar
to the declines in firearm related injury rates and death rates
among children and teenagers. This similarity is intriguing
and could be potentially the result of legislative and
educational efforts to prevent unsupervised access to guns by
children. More research is needed to investigate the potential
role of these efforts in explaining the decline in BB/pellet gun
related injury rates. Most BB/pellet gun related injuries
occurred among younger males, were unintentional shoot-
ings, and were either self inflicted or inflicted by a relative or
friend.2 Public awareness and concern about this issue has
increased since the early 1990s, as evidenced by increased leg-
islation. In 1981, a survey by CPSC found that 12 states had
laws that restricted possession or use of BB/pellet guns by
minors and furnishing or selling these guns to children.27
According to a search using LexisNexis (Reed Elsevier, Inc,
Dayton, Ohio), a database that provides full text access to state
laws pertaining to firearms, that number increased to 14 states
by 1994 and 28 states by 1996.1 15 Our research for the year
2000 found that 43 states currently have laws (table 3).28
Eleven states now have laws that define BB/pellet guns as
either firearms or dangerous weapons.28 Nineteen states have
enacted laws that hold parents or guardians legally responsi-
ble for injuries or deaths resulting from minors using their
firearms and 10 states have laws requiring parents or
guardians to protect minors by properly storing their
firearms.28 Safe storage laws intended to make firearms less
accessible to children have been linked to a 23% reduction in
unintentional shooting deaths of children aged 15 years or
younger.29 Also, the number of unintentional firearm related
injury deaths for children aged 19 years and younger in the US
was relatively constant from 1985 through 1993 and then
declined from 526 deaths in 1993 to 214 deaths in 1999.30
Another factor that might have contributed to the recent
decline in BB/pellet gun related injury rates is the increase in
prevention programs aimed at reducing gun violence among
children and youth. Although BB/pellet gun related injuries
were mostly unintentional, about 13% of BB/pellet gun related
injuries among persons aged 15­19 years were assaults. Fatal
and non-fatal firearm related injuries are predominantly vio-
lence related. Since the early 1990s firearm related injury and
death rates have declined substantially in the US.3 Efforts
supported by public health, criminal justice, and educational
agencies and organizations may have contributed to the
decline in BB/pellet gun related injuries, especially those asso-
ciated with interpersonal violence. These efforts promote the
adoption of youth violence prevention programs shown to be
effective in reducing violent behavior and associated injuries
and target parents, children, and teenagers.31 32 In the year
2000, 63% of all elementary and middle/junior high schools
participated in programs to prevent bullying and 46.4% of all
schools participated in a program in which family or commu-
nity members serve as role models or mentor students, such as
the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. Most schools (96.1%)
also have a policy that prohibits student weapon possession or
use.33 Prevention messages aimed specifically at reducing fire-
arm related injuries among children have focused on increas-
ing parent/guardian awareness of the increased risk of injury
associated with unsupervised access to firearms, promoting
safe gun storage and practices for gun owners and users, and
educating policy makers about those at risk of injury.
Limitations of our data exist because our national estimates
of non-fatal BB/pellet gun related injuries include only those
that were treated in hospital emergency departments.
BB/pellet gun related injuries that were not medically treated
or were treated in outpatient clinics or doctors' offices were not
included. We could not examine trends in BB/pellet gun
related injuries treated in these outpatient settings because no
national data exist. NEISS provides nationally representative
estimates, but does not accommodate state or local estimates.
Additionally, NEISS is a probability sample of US hospitals
and estimates are subject to sampling error. Nevertheless, the
coefficients of variation for national estimates of BB/pellet gun
related injuries have remained relatively small, approximately
7% overall for persons aged 19 years and younger, and have
been stable over time. Also, adjustments were made for a
NEISS sampling frame change that occurred in 1997 so that
our trend analyses would be statistically valid.17 Trend analysis
with or without these statistical adjustments lead to similar
conclusions for this study.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PREVENTION
Prevention efforts have focused on informing gun owners that
BB/pellet guns can be dangerous, even lethal, and need to be
properly stored, locked and unloaded, so that children will not
be tempted to play with them or use them without adult
supervision.34 These prevention messages remind parents or
guardians about their role in ensuring the safety of their chil-
dren around guns. Parents or guardians should also be
informed that injuries can occur to their children at a friend's
home where a loaded, BB/pellet gun may be readily available.8
Parents need to take steps to ensure that their children, espe-
cially boys, are not exposed to BB/pellet guns in various places
that they go and play. Boys have been found to choose
handling a gun, if they find one, regardless of their parents'
beliefs about their children's perceived interest in guns.35
Our study suggests that growing prevention efforts aimed
at reducing unsupervised access to guns by children and
reducing youth violence coincide with the decline in national
BB/pellet gun related injury rates and firearm related injury
and death rates in the US. A carefully designed evaluation at
the state and local levels of prevention efforts aimed at reduc-
ing both BB/pellet gun related and firearm related injuries is
warranted. These prevention efforts should be combined with
other efforts, such as improving the design and safety features
of guns; increasing the number of states with laws that restrict
unsupervised access to powder and non-powder guns by
minors; using stricter sentencing guidelines for crimes
committed with guns36; and improving law enforcement
practices.36 Together, these efforts could potentially help to
reduce the risk of gun related injuries and improve the safety
of our children.
Key points
· Tracking BB/pellet gun and firearm related injury rates
simultaneously can be an informative injury surveillance
tool.
· For persons aged 19 years and younger, non-fatal
BB/pellet gun related injuries have been declining along
with fatal and non-fatal firearm related injuries from the
early 1990s through 1999.
· Prevention efforts aimed at reducing unsupervised access to
guns by children and reducing youth violence coincide with
declines in BB/pellet gun related injury rates and firearm
related injury and death rates for persons aged 19 years
and younger in the US.
· A carefully designed evaluation of the effectiveness of pre-
vention efforts in reducing both BB/pellet gun and firearm
related injuries at the state and local levels is warranted.
· Prevention messages should continue to remind parents and
guardians that BB/pellet guns are not harmless toys. Not
only can their children hurt themselves seriously from
improper use of these guns, but they may also inflict injuries
on others.
· Prevention efforts, including legislation and law enforce-
ment, education, programs, and improved gun safety
design, working collectively could potentially help to reduce
the risk of gun related injuries and improve the safety of our
children.
