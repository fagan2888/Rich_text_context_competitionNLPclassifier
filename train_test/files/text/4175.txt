A central strand of contemporary research on emotions is the
study of nonverbal expressions. To date, most studies of emo-
tional communication treat positive emotion as a unitary cate-
gory, that is, "joy" or "happiness." However, in recent years
researchers are increasingly examining expressions of a range
of diverse positive emotional states. This article provides an
overview of that work, focusing on the study of adults (for a
recent developmental review, see Sauter, McDonald, Gangi, &
Messinger, 2014). This review is structured using an emotion
family approach, organising the research on nonverbal signals
of positive emotions into epistemological, prosocial, savour-
ing, and agency-approach positive emotions. Epistemological
emotions entail a change in one's knowledge state, prosocial
emotions emphasise a focus on others' wellbeing, savouring
emotions relate to enjoying physiologically pleasurable stim-
uli, and agency-approach emotions involve a tendency to
approach potentially rewarding stimuli. In the final section,
general conclusions and limitations are noted and some propos-
als for future research are outlined. In order to provide an over-
view, Table 1 provides a summary of the nonverbal facial,
vocal, and bodily cues that have been found to occur in the
communication of each of the 13 positive emotions reviewed in
the current article. Table 2 gives a summary of studies that have
examined nonverbal communication of specific positive emo-
tions, with information about the channel of communication
examined, whether the focus was on perception, production, or
both, as well as the cultures included.
Mapping Emotions to Expressions
One feature of the investigation of nonverbal expressions of
emotions is the use of objective cues like acoustic information
and analyses of facial and bodily muscle movements. In map-
ping emotional states onto physical cues, researchers attempt to
establish links between emotion and behaviour without relying
on subjective self-report as a primary measure. Emotions are
typically either inferred from antecedent events or known
in advance when expressions are posed. A complementary
approach to measuring objective cues employs perceptual
measures such as ratings or classification tasks, to establish how
perceivers judge others' emotional expressions. The majority of
studies to date have examined the perception, rather than pro-
duction, of emotional expressions. The logic is that perceivers
can only consistently map an emotional state to an observed
nonverbal expression if there is a link between an emotional
state and that expression in the expresser. For example, if

Abstract
This review provides an overview of the research on nonverbal expressions of positive emotions, organised into emotion families,
that is, clusters sharing common characteristics. Epistemological positive emotions (amusement, relief, awe, and interest) are
found to have distinct, recognisable displays via vocal or facial cues, while the agency-approach positive emotions (elation and
pride) appear to be associated with recognisable visual, but not auditory, cues. Evidence is less strong for the prosocial emotions
(love, compassion, gratitude, and admiration) in any modality other than touch, and there is little support for distinct recognisable
signals of the savouring positive emotions (contentment, sensory pleasure, and desire). In closing, some limitations of extant work
are noted and some proposals for future research are outlined.

observers consistently infer that a person who is laughing is
amused, that is taken to demonstrate a link between laughter and
amusement, which is assumed to exist not only in the observer
but also in the expresser.
Though a wealth of empirical evidence points to consistent
mappings between nonverbal expressions and subjective emo-
tional states for a limited set of emotions (see Lench, Flores, &
Bench, 2011, for a meta-analysis) considerable variability has
also been noted (Scarantino, 2015). Emotional expressions do
not always occur when an emotional state is experienced, and
conversely, some configurations of nonverbal behaviours occur
despite an individual not experiencing the emotional state that
the expression supposedly maps onto. Recent accounts claiming
links between emotional states and nonverbal signals have

emphasised the probabilistic nature of these associations (see
Levenson, 2011; Roseman, 2011). Only when unlearned trig-
gers occur would the link to behaviour (including nonverbal
expressions) be rigid (Ekman, 2007). For example, experienc-
ing a sudden loss of physical support would be linked to fear
behaviours, and tasting a strong bitter flavour would elicit dis-
gust behaviours. For positive emotions, unlearned triggers may
include gentle touch and sweet tastes. The probability of a fixed
association between subjective state and nonverbal behaviour is
thought to depend on the prototypicality of the antecedent event,
and relatedly, on the intensity of the emotional experience
(Scarantino, 2015). Importantly for the current discussion, how-
ever, a claim of an association between a nonverbal behaviour
and a subjective emotional state does not depend on a perfect
one-to-one mapping between the two.
Emotion Families
How best to conceptualise the structure of human emotions is an
issue on which views range widely. Nevertheless, most theorists
would agree that each emotional state is not equally similar to
all other emotional states. One way to operationalise these simi-
larities is the notion of "emotion families" proposed by Ekman
(1992), that is, groups of emotional states sharing common
characteristics. Such clustering could be done on the basis of
features such as antecedent events, nonverbal expressions, or
patterns of appraisals or action tendencies.
Most research to date has presumably examined only a sin-
gle positive emotion ("happiness") because all positive emo-
tions have been considered part of a single emotion family, as
positive emotions are all characterised by positive valence.
Some accounts have posited shared mechanisms of positive
emotions, such as facilitating approach (Davidson & Irwin,
1999) or increasing one's repertoire of thoughts and actions
(Fredrickson, 1998). An alternative possibility is that positive
emotion space is comprised of multiple emotion families that
share additional characteristics. An analysis of the English emo-
tion lexicon has lent support to this kind of structure: words
cluster together around multiple positive emotional concepts
(Shaver, Schwartz, Kirson, & O'Connor, 1987), and there is
some preliminary evidence suggesting that nonverbal behav-
iours may also cluster into conceptually meaningful positive
emotion families (App, McIntosh, Reed, & Hertenstein, 2011;
Simon-Thomas, Keltner, Sauter, Sinicropi-Yao, & Abramson,
2009). Building on this work, the current review is organised in
sections of possible families of positive emotions (Simon-
Thomas et al., 2009), discussing nonverbal expressions of epis-
temological, prosocial, savouring, and agency-approach
positive emotions in turn. However, given the scarcity of
proposed classifications of positive emotions, this division is
226 Emotion Review Vol. 9 No. 3
necessarily preliminary. This is true both in terms of whether
specific emotion categories are best classified into one or the
other superordinate category, and in terms of whether this struc-
ture is useful for establishing commonalities across subsets of
positive emotions. In addition to providing an overview of
extant research, one aim of the current review is to evaluate
whether this proposed classification fits the available evidence
on nonverbal communication of emotions.
Epistemological Positive Emotions
Some positive emotional states involve a change in the indi-
vidual's understanding of, or knowledge about, the world.
These emotions can be considered epistemological positive
emotions. They can, for example, involve the seeking out of
new information (i.e., interest), or the realisation that an
expected negative event will not occur (i.e., relief). The new
information need not in itself be positive, but the change in
knowledge results in a positive emotional state. The episte-
mological positive emotions include interest, relief, amuse-
ment, and awe.
Amusement
Amusement, the feeling of finding something funny, is a posi-
tive subjective state that can result from a resolution of incon-
gruity (Carroll, 2013). In recent years, the nonverbal behaviour
of amusement has been the focus of a considerable body of
research, both in studies examining auditory and visual com-
munication. This research has primarily examined laughter, a
vocal and facial suite of behaviours associated with amusement
(for reviews on laughter see Owren & Amoss, 2014; Ruch &
Ekman, 2001). Experimental work has established that amuse-
ment induction (e.g., funny movies) reliably induces laughter
(e.g., Ruch, 1995), though most research has focused on whether
observers infer amusement from others' laughter. In a recent
study using a multimodal corpus of emotional expressions,
amusement was found to be the best recognised of all 12 emo-
tions studied across modalities (Bänziger, Mortillaro, & Scherer,
2012). The demonstration by Bänziger and colleagues that
laughter can be recognised from visual cues alone extends ear-
lier findings that have described the facial movements associ-
ated with amusement without directly linking production and
perception. Several studies have noted that amusement is linked
to Duchenne smiles, that is, smiles co-occurring with raised
cheeks (Campos, Shiota, Keltner, Gonzaga, & Goetz, 2013;
Hess, Beaupré, & Cheung, 2002; Shiota, Campos, & Keltner,
2003). In particular, spontaneous amusement has been linked to
intense smiles with open jaws, and perceivers also judge smiles
with those characteristics as expressing amusement (Ambadar,
Cohn, & Reed, 2009). Notably, this configuration of cues has
been found to communicate amusement across several cultures
(Haidt & Keltner, 1999).
A small body of research has examined full-body cues
associated with emotions, with recent findings suggesting
that bodily cues can under some conditions convey affective
information more clearly than facial expressions (Aviezer,
Trope, & Todorov, 2012). Data is lacking for most positive
emotions, but a recent study examined the bodily configuration
associated with amusement as well as a few additional positive
emotions (Dael, Mortillaro, & Scherer, 2012). Employing dis-
criminant analyses of body movements, configurations of
movements expressing amusement were accurately classified,
and evidence for a prototypical response pattern was estab-
lished. Specifically, discontinuous touching and a straight
head position was found to be characteristic of amusement,
and the authors suggested that this likely reflects a laughter
response pattern involving the entire body.
Laughter has also been found to communicate amusement
via auditory perception alone (see Owren & Amoss, 2014, for a
review) via both nonverbal vocalisations and speech inflection
(e.g., Cowie & Cornelius, 2003; Sauter, Eisner, Calder, & Scott,
2010; Simon-Thomas et al., 2009). Notably, this pattern is con-
sistent across cultures (Cordaro, Keltner, Tshering, Wangchuk,
& Flynn, 2016; Laukka et al., 2013; Sauter, Eisner, Ekman, &
Scott, 2010; Sauter & Scott, 2007). In sum, amusement can be
clearly communicated using either visual or auditory cues of
laughter across cultures. Laughter has been linked to emo-
tional states other than amusement, including schadenfreude
(Szameitat et al., 2009), and is part of the response to the tactile
stimulation of being tickled, which may or may not be accom-
panied by an emotional state (see Harris & Alvarado, 2005).
Nevertheless, the link between the emotional state of amuse-
ment and nonverbal signals of laughter appears to be robust
across modalities and cultural groups.
Awe
There is growing interest from emotion researchers in awe, the
feeling of being in the presence of something greater than one-
self (see Stellar et al., 2017; Valdesolo et al., 2017). Awe, which
is often elicited by views of nature, has been suggested to
involve a need for cognitive accommodation, that is, the adjust-
ment of one's ideas of what is possible in the world (Keltner &
Haidt, 2002). However, only a few studies have investigated the
nonverbal communication of awe, though there has been con-
siderable consistency across those studies. Examinations of
facial expressions of awe have shown that smiling rarely occurs,
but rather, awe is associated with head movements forward and
up, widened eyes, an open mouth with a slightly dropped jaw,
and raised inner eyebrows (Campos et al., 2013; Shiota et al.,
2003). These facial changes may in part facilitate the hypothe-
sised function of awe, that is, the enhanced processing of infor-
mation to aid the cognitive accommodation sought during
experiences of awe. However, no study to date has examined the
recognition of facial signals of awe, though one study has found
high levels of recognition across two cultural groups for Indian
dance segments expressing the closely related state wonder
(Hejmadi, Davidson, & Rozin, 2000).
Participants posing awe expressions also frequently pro-
duced visible inhalations (Shiota et al., 2003), and awe has
also been associated with voiced exhalations (Simon-Thomas
Sauter The Nonverbal Communication of Positive Emotions 227
et al., 2009). Such prototypical vocal awe displays are well
recognised by naive listeners (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009).
This suggests that awe is reliably communicated via auditory
signals, in addition to having a consistent configuration of
facial cues. It is also worth noting that awe has been linked to
goosebumps, which have been posited to serve a signalling
function for profound positive experiences (Maruskin,
Thrash, & Elliot, 2012); that positive emotion can be inferred
from perceiving goosebumps may be an interesting hypothe-
sis for further study.
Interest
Interest, the feeling of wanting to learn more about something,
functions to motivate exploration and has been proposed to be a
primary affect (Tomkins, 1995). However, results on the non-
verbal communication of interest are conflicting. For example,
interest being associated with an open mouth (Mortillaro, Mehu,
& Scherer, 2011) is contradicted by results linking interest to lip
presses (Campos et al., 2013). Furthermore, in Bänziger et al.'s
(2012) multimodal study, interest was overall the worst recog-
nised positive emotion out of the six included in the study, with
speech intonation even less well recognised than facial displays.
This contrasts with earlier findings that have found high levels
of recognition for interested speech prosody, characterised by
fast rate of speech and a great vocal frequency range (Banse &
Scherer, 1996). There is more consistency in the results of stud-
ies of nonverbal vocalisations, with exclamations of interest
recognisable (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009) even across cultural
boundaries (Laukka et al., 2013).
In terms of full body movements, interest is characterised by
facing straight ahead and leaning forward, likely linked to the
motivation to approach associated with interest (Dael et al.,
2012; see also de Meijer, 1989). However, this bodily configu-
ration is not unique to interest and expressions are sometimes
misclassified as pride.
It has been suggested that awe and interest may be best
explained as variations of a single emotion, as both involve
some degree of cognitive accommodation, though interest is
thought to be less intense (Campos et al., 2013). However, the
only recognition study to date to include both awe and interest
found low rates of confusion between the two for nonverbal
vocalisations (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009). Could it be that
there is more overlap between the facial than vocal configura-
tions of awe and interest? Facial expressions of interest, like
those of awe, do not typically involve smiling, but rather an
open mouth (Mortillaro et al., 2011; Reeve, 1993). However, the
eye configuration often seen in awe with wide open eyes stands
in contrast to the mild squinting or eye closure associated with
interest (Mortillaro et al., 2011; Reeve, 1993). This suggests
some differentiation, but at present, it is not known whether per-
ceivers can differentiate between facial expressions of awe and
interest. In sum, there is evidence for recognisable nonverbal
vocalisations of interest, but evidence on facial expressions is
less clear-cut, in particular with regard to the relationship
between awe and interest configurations.
Relief
Relief is a positive emotional experience that occurs when an
unpleasant emotional experience ceases. If the unpleasant expe-
rience is ongoing, relief is elicited when it ends, or upon learn-
ing that it will end sooner than expected. If the negative
experience is anticipated to occur in the future, relief results
from finding out that the negative experience will not occur.
Relief can also be the result of a negative experience being less
bad than had been expected. Multiple studies of nonverbal
vocalisations have established that relief can be very reliably
inferred from sighs. For example, Schröder (2003) found that
relief was recognised at near-ceiling levels by listeners. This
finding has since been replicated (Sauter, Eisner, Calder, et al.,
2010; Simon-Thomas et al., 2009) and extended to show that
relief elicits sighs across cultures (Laukka et al., 2013; Sauter,
Eisner, Ekman, et al., 2010).
Relief can also be recognised from visual cues alone
(Bänziger et al., 2012), though no work has yet tested whether
visual cues of relief are consistent across cultures. Facially, pro-
totypical relief expressions are characterised by a low-intensity
smile, preceded by mouth opening, eye closure, and the head
moving up (Krumhuber & Scherer, 2011). In terms of global
body movements, only one study to date has included relief
(Dael et al., 2012). A statistical classifier could accurately clas-
sify relief expressions and differentiate them from other (posi-
tive) emotions, but the only distinguishing feature of the relief
expressions was that of retiring one's hands in one's pockets.
Summary: Epistemological Positive Emotions
To summarise, there is clear support that all of the epistemo-
logical positive emotions examined to date (amusement, relief,
awe, and interest) have distinct, recognisable displays via
vocal or facial cues. These, together with pride (see section
below) arguably constitute the strongest candidates for posi-
tive emotions associated with specific, identifiable nonverbal
expressions.
Prosocial Positive Emotions
Positive emotions can serve the function of orienting people
towards the welfare of others and to foster profound social rela-
tionships. It has been argued that increased concern for others is
a central aspect of many positive emotions, though it is particu-
larly pronounced for certain emotions (Keltner, 2009). The
prosocial positive emotions include love, compassion (some-
times called sympathy), gratitude, and admiration. These emo-
tions stand in contrast to positive emotions that enhance the
individual experiencing the emotion, such as pride.
Love
A consensus definition of love is lacking in the literature, and
both whether it is an emotion and whether it is positive have
been questioned (Lamy, 2016). Nevertheless, love is typically
228 Emotion Review Vol. 9 No. 3
conceptualised as a positive emotion that stimulates com-
mitment to intimate relationships (Campos et al., 2013).
Nonverbal signals of love may reward prosocial behaviour
and signal prosocial intent (Hertenstein, Keltner, App, Bulleit,
& Jaskolka, 2006).
Several studies have established an association between bod-
ily movements and love. One study examined couples in roman-
tic relationships as they interacted with each other in a series of
semistructured discussions. Self-reported feelings of love cor-
related with head nods, Duchenne smiles, and forward leans
(Gonzaga, Keltner, Londahl, & Smith, 2001). Consistent with
these results, a study examining posed expressions found that
love was associated with Duchenne smiles, mutual gaze, affili-
ative hand gestures, open posture, and forward leans (Campos
et al., 2013). It is notable that these studies have highlighted
movements beyond the face, such as postural shifts and hand
gestures. However, love may in fact be preferentially communi-
cated via a completely different type of signal, namely touch
(App et al., 2011). App and colleagues found that, when given
an unrestricted choice of expression modality between touch,
face, or body, touch was preferred to bodily or facial cues
for expressing love, and signals of love were identified more
accurately from observed touch than from facial or bodily
movement. This corroborates studies showing that love can be
reliably communicated from touch, typically using hugging or
stroking movements (Hertenstein, Holmes, McCullough, &
Keltner, 2009), in both North American and Spanish partici-
pants (Hertenstein et al., 2006).
In contrast, the evidence that love can be communicated via
vocal signals is less strong. A meta-analysis of vocal communi-
cation of emotion grouped positive emotions into "happiness"
and "love-tenderness" (Juslin & Laukka, 2003). Speech
inflected with love was characterised by slow speech rate, low
voice intensity, low pitch level, and little pitch variability, but
had the lowest decoding levels of all the emotions examined.
This aligns with findings from the communication of emotions
via nonverbal vocalisations, where only modest recognition
rates have been found for vocalisations of love (affection), both
within and across cultures (Laukka et al., 2013). The authors
concluded that love may lack a distinct type of vocalisation.
Furthermore, affection vocalisations were commonly confused
with interest, an epistemological rather than prosocial emotion.
Frequent misclassifications of speech intonation pattern of ten-
derness have also been found in a study with a statistical classi-
fier model using acoustic information (Hammerschmidt &
Jürgens, 2007). Speech expressing tenderness was specifically
misclassified as expressing sensual satisfaction, which could be
considered a savouring positive emotion. Thus, there is evi-
dence that love is communicated via touch and full-body move-
ment, but it does not appear to be associated with unique, clearly
recognisable vocal cues.
Compassion
Compassion, sometimes referred to as sympathy, is a desire to
help in response to perceiving another's suffering (see Stellar
et al., 2017). It is differentiated from empathy, which is the
vicarious experiencing of another's suffering, because feeling
compassion does not necessarily involve suffering and theorists
have conceptualised it as a positive emotional experience
(Goetz, Keltner, & Simon-Thomas, 2010). Several studies have
shown that compassion is marked by some facial features of
sadness, combined with approach behaviours such as forward
leans (Eisenberg et al., 1989; see also de Meijer, 1989). This
differs from facial displays of love because of the absence of
smiling, and differs from sadness due to the signals of approach
in compassion. However, visual expressions of compassion are
poorly recognised and often mistaken for sadness (e.g., Haidt &
Keltner, 1999).
Consistent with the pattern of results for visual displays, the
study of vocal expressions has found low levels of accuracy for
recognition of nonverbal vocalisations of compassion (Simon-
Thomas et al., 2009). An analysis of classification errors
revealed that love and gratitude vocalisations were often identi-
fied as expressions of compassion, suggesting that vocalisations
of all of those emotions may be used to communicate a general
prosocial state of affiliation.
The strongest evidence for signals of compassion comes
from the study of touch, with patting and stroking movements
recognised as expressions of compassion across two cultural
groups (Hertenstein et al., 2006). This is supported by a direct
comparison across channels of communication, where partici-
pants favoured touch over face and body for expressing com-
passion (App et al., 2011). Naive participants were also more
accurate in identifying compassion from observed touch as
compared to facial and bodily displays, and in line with findings
from studies of recognition from vocal cues, errors classifying
touch tended to occur between compassion and love. In sum,
evidence for a distinct, recognisable display of compassion
from visual or auditory cues is weak, but rather, compassion
appears to be preferentially signalled via touch.
Gratitude
Gratitude is what we feel when someone lends us a helping
hand. It has been conceptualised as a positive emotional state
caused by appreciating benefits perceived to be intentionally
bestowed upon oneself, and it is thought to be important for
promoting social relationships (Algoe & Haidt, 2009; see also
Armenta et al., 2017; Stellar et al., 2017). Though gratitude is
marked by behavioural tendencies, such as reciprocating
(Algoe & Haidt, 2009), little research has examined nonverbal
expressions of this prosocial emotion and results to date are
weak.
Gratitude has been found to lack a reliable visual expressive
display (Campos et al., 2013) and to be poorly recognised
from nonverbal vocalisations (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009). In
contrast, touch has been shown to communicate gratitude
(Hertenstein et al., 2009; Hertenstein et al., 2006), but the most
frequent way to express gratitude was a handshake, suggesting
a conventionalised signal that may not generalise beyond par-
ticular cultural groups.
Sauter The Nonverbal Communication of Positive Emotions 229
Admiration
The experience of admiration is triggered by the perception of
another's extraordinary achievement (Algoe & Haidt, 2009).
We may feel admiration when learning of someone having a
brilliant insight, or when experiencing an exceptional artistic
accomplishment, such as a virtuoso musical performance.
Said achievement should be outside of the moral domain, as
witnessing moral virtue triggers elevation (Algoe & Haidt,
2009), which has not yet been studied in the context of nonver-
bal communication. Admiration is a positive emotion that has
received little attention from researchers of nonverbal com-
munication, and the available evidence holds only limited
promise for the notion that admiration may be signalled via
nonverbal expressions.
In a study of nonverbal vocalisations, Schröder (2003) found
that recognition levels were nearly at ceiling for expressions of
admiration. However, this was also the case when only segmen-
tal information was provided (i.e., transcriptions such as
"wow"), suggesting that these exclamations may be conven-
tionalised emblems, rather than fully nonverbal vocalisations
like sighs and screams.
In a more recent study by Bänziger et al. (2012), moderate
levels of recognition were found from both visual and auditory
signals of admiration when presented alone, but there was a
marked advantage for audiovisual presentation. This may sug-
gest that there is relatively little redundancy in expressions of
admiration, such that visual and auditory cues complement each
other. Notably, expressions of admiration were frequently mis-
taken for surprise, which likely reflects the conceptual overlap
between these two emotions, as both involve an unexpected
event (Algoe & Haidt, 2009).
Summary: Prosocial Positive Emotions
Current evidence indicates that the prosocial emotions (love,
compassion, gratitude, and admiration) are not reliably commu-
nicated in any modality other than touch. This is clear support
for the proposal that the most effective mode of communication
of an emotion may depend in part on the emotion's social func-
tion (App et al., 2011), with prosocial emotions playing a par-
ticularly important role in intimate social relationships.
Savouring positive emotions
An obvious way that positive emotions are triggered is from
thinking about or experiencing enjoyable stimuli such as food or
sex. Such savouring positive emotions include contentment,
sensory pleasure, and sexual desire. The roots of savouring
emotions are likely linked to unconditioned stimuli like food
and touch, that fulfil basic needs.
Contentment
Contentment has been defined as an emotion accompanying
satisfaction of one's basic needs. Sometimes called satisfaction,
it is the feeling of enjoying a quiet rest after completing
a good day's work. The central appraisal features that charac-
terise contentment do not differentiate it well from other
positive emotions (Campos et al., 2013). Conflation between
contentment and other positive emotional states has also been
found in the study of vocal signals. Specifically, nonverbal
vocalisations of contentment were often confused with (sen-
sual) pleasure across several studies (Sauter, Eisner, Calder,
et al., 2010; Sauter & Scott, 2007). It is not clear whether visual
cues of contentment are specific to that emotion; posed dis-
plays have been shown to primarily feature smiling (Campos
et al., 2013). Specifically, Duchenne smiles and smiles with
the lips pressed together occurred frequently in expressions
of contentment, but given the ubiquity of smiling in positive
emotions it remains to be established whether facial expres-
sions of contentment can be recognised.
Sensory Pleasure
Sensory pleasure is the enjoyment of a physical stimulus, such
as food or sex. Sensory pleasure can be elicited from uncondi-
tional stimuli such as pleasant touch, but also through learned
associations. For example, one can experience pleasure from
tasting flavours that are at first exposure not typically judged to
be pleasant (e.g., coffee, wine). Although pleasure has been
included in a number of studies of nonverbal behaviour, results
to date do not clearly point to a unique, recognisable signal for
this emotional state.
As noted, vocal signals of pleasure are frequently confused
with contentment (e.g., Sauter & Scott, 2007), and though rec-
ognition rates for pleasure are relatively high within culture,
they appear to be culturally variable (Sauter, Eisner, Ekman,
et al., 2010). However, given that posed expressions of pleasure
are perceived as inauthentic (Bänziger et al., 2012), it remains to
be tested whether genuine-sounding vocalisations of pleasure
are shared across cultural boundaries.
In terms of bodily movements, pleasure has been found to be
associated with a prototypical response pattern consisting of
tilting the head upwards and away, accompanied by asymmetri-
cal arm movements (Dael et al., 2012). However, no study to
date has examined whether observers can infer pleasure from
others' bodily movements.
Examining facial cues of positive emotions, Ricci-Bitti,
Caterina, and Garotti (1996) described the facial changes asso-
ciated with pleasure as closed eyes in combination with a
Duchenne smile. This was corroborated by a more recent study
(Mortillaro et al., 2011), which found that facial expressions of
pleasure were characterised by smiling, eye closure, and mouth
opening. Complementing this work, there is some evidence sug-
gesting that perceivers can recognise pleasure from facial cues.
However, this seems to be the case primarily for pleasure
expressions of high intensity (Wehrle, Kaiser, Schmidt, &
Scherer, 2000) and for audiovisual displays (Bänziger et al.,
2012). It is worth noting that confusion patterns for pleasure
expressions are highly variable; they have been interpreted
primarily as love/tenderness (Bänziger et al., 2012), interest
230 Emotion Review Vol. 9 No. 3
(Mortillaro et al., 2011), and pride (Wehrle et al., 2000). The
variation in emotion stimuli used in these studies renders these
inconsistencies difficult to interpret, and highlight the need for
consistency in studies in this area. One contributing factor, how-
ever, may be that the emotion most closely related to pleasure,
at least for facial expressions, is not another positive emotion,
but rather pain. Detailed analysis of facial movements during
pleasure and pain have supported the notion that there is overlap
between the facial configurations of these two states (Fernandez-
Dols, Carrera, & Crivelli, 2011), though observers are able to
distinguish these expressions at greater than chance levels in the
absence of contextual cues (Hughes & Nicholson, 2008).
However, the studies examining overlap in facial expressions
between pleasure and pain have specifically focused on sexual
pleasure; sexual enjoyment may differ from other forms of sen-
sory pleasure, both in terms of facial configurations and on
other features, such as action tendencies.
Sexual Desire
Desire is a state that leads a person to seek out opportunities for
sexual activity (Gonzaga, Turner, Keltner, Campos, & Altemus,
2006). It differs from sensory pleasure, which may also contain
a sexual element, in that the contact has not yet occurred. Only
a few studies have examined the nonverbal expressions of sex-
ual desire.
Just a single study to date has examined the visual cues of
desire (Gonzaga et al., 2006). It showed that self-reported feelings
of desire in a semistructured interaction correlated with lip licks,
bites, and puckering during interactions with a romantic, sexual
partner. These sexual displays were also correlated with the part-
ner's self-reported sexual desire, but whether these displays are
explicitly recognised as signalling desire has not yet been tested.
Evidence on vocal signals of desire is mixed. One study
found that nonverbal vocalisations of desire were poorly recog-
nised, with errors distributed across many other response alter-
natives, possibly due to large variability among the desire
expressions (Simon-Thomas et al., 2009). In contrast, Laukka
et al. (2013) found that lust was one of the best recognised
vocalisation types of the nine positive emotions in their study.
Recognition levels were however still moderate, because sounds
were frequently conflated with relief, serenity, and positive sur-
prise. It may be that the inconsistency between these studies can
be accounted for by differences between desire and lust, but it
cannot currently be concluded that desire is associated with a
nonverbal signal in any modality.
Summary: Savouring Positive Emotions
There is currently little support for distinct recognisable signals
of the savouring positive emotions (contentment, sensory pleas-
ure, and desire). The overlap between them in terms of confu-
sion errors may be an indication that these do not constitute
states with distinct signals; the extent to which other criteria do
differentiate these emotional states will be a worthwhile ques-
tion for future research.
Agency-Approach Positive Emotions
Though not all positive emotions facilitate approach towards
reward-related actions (e.g., Gable & Harmon-Jones, 2008),
some, including elation and pride, are characterised by approach
tendencies. These emotions are more individual than many of
the other positive emotions, that is, they do not primarily involve
a positive interaction with another person: they may not require
the involvement of a social partner at all (i.e., elation) or they
may involve others only for social comparison (i.e., pride).
Elation
Elation is a highly aroused positive emotional state caused by an
unexpected positive event (Mortillaro et al., 2011), such as win-
ning the lottery. Closely related states are enthusiasm, triumph,
and excitement; these are discussed together here as there is cur-
rently little theoretical differentiation made between these
states. Elation is however differentiated from joy (sometimes
called happiness), which typically refers to a positive emotional
state in a more general sense. Elation is distinct from joy both in
terms of the specificity of the target state, and in terms of levels
of arousal, since elation is characterised by particularly high
arousal.
In a study of emotional speech prosody comparing segments
differing in arousal, most emotion pairs (e.g., panic and anxiety)
were found to frequently be confused (Banse & Scherer, 1996).
However, elation and joy were rarely mistaken for each other,
suggesting that they may have distinct prosodic contours,
although recognition levels for both were moderate.
Several studies have demonstrated that nonverbal vocalisa-
tions of enthusiasm and triumph are not well recognised, and it
has been suggested that this emotional state may lack a clear
vocal nonverbal signature (Schröder, 2003). Consistent with
this notion, Bänziger et al. (2012) found that vocal signals of
elated joy were poorly recognised, and frequently confused with
amusement. Simon-Thomas et al. (2009) found that elation in
the form of triumph was poorly recognised from nonverbal
vocalisations, while enthusiasm was recognised with moderate
levels of accuracy. Notably, enthusiasm and triumph were fre-
quently mistaken for each other, underscoring the overlap
between these two states.
Facial expressions of elation are marked by smiles accompa-
nied by widened eye aperture (Ricci-Bitti et al., 1996) or
Duchenne smile together with raised eyebrows (Mortillaro
et al., 2011). In terms of recognition, judges can differentiate
elated facial expressions well from related states such as pleas-
ure and happiness, especially when viewing high-intensity,
dynamic expressions (Wehrle et al., 2000; see also Fujimura &
Suzuki, 2010, for a similar finding).
Several studies have examined full-body cues associated
with elation. Wallbott (1998) found that elation was charac-
terised by high movement activity and fast and expansive
movements (see also de Meijer, 1989, for a similar result).
Specifically, the arms were stretched out and the head was
tilted up and back. A discriminant analysis yielded high levels
Sauter The Nonverbal Communication of Positive Emotions 231
of accuracy for elevated joy expressions. Consistent with
these findings, a more recent study found high accuracy for
full-body cues submitted to a discriminant analysis, though
the specific movements for elated joy were repetitive vertical
movement of the arms and knees (Dael et al., 2012). However,
recognition data from full-body cues associated with elated
joy is currently missing.
In sum, elation is linked to reliable patterns of facial and
bodily movements, but not to a type of nonverbal vocalisation.
Pride
Pride is a positive, self-conscious emotion triggered by the com-
pletion of a goal; it is thought to play a role in enhancing the
individual's social status (Tracy & Robins, 2007). We feel proud
when accomplishing a challenging goal, be it academic, ath-
letic, or personal. Pride is the positive emotion whose nonverbal
communication has been studied most extensively (see Tracy,
Weidman, Cheng, & Martens, 2014, for a review).
Evidence for consistent and recognisable visual displays of
pride is strong. Prototypical displays are characterised by a
combination of bodily and facial changes, specifically expanded
posture, a head tilt back, and a small smile (Tracy et al., 2014).
This expression is produced spontaneously in pride-eliciting
situations and communicates pride also across cultural bounda-
ries (Tracy & Matsumoto, 2008; Tracy & Robins, 2008).
Notably, facial cues alone are insufficient for perceivers to dif-
ferentiate pride from joy (App et al., 2011; Mortillaro et al.,
2011; Wehrle et al., 2000) and conversely, pride is frequently
misclassified as elation when bodily cues of pride are judged in
the absence of facial information (Dael et al., 2012; Wallbott,
1998).
In contrast, several studies have shown that pride is not well
recognised from auditory signals, with classification errors dis-
tributed across both positive and negative emotions (Bänziger
et al., 2012; Simon-Thomas et al., 2009).
To summarise, pride is communicated via a combination of
postural and bodily cues, but not from vocalisations or facial
expressions alone.
Summary: Agency-Approach Positive Emotions
The findings available to date suggest that agency-approach
positive emotions (elation and pride) are associated with recog-
nisable visual, but not auditory, cues. The consistency seen for
the emotions in this emotion family may point to positive emo-
tions characterised by a strong approach motivation being pref-
erentially communicated via visual signals.
Conclusions, Limitations, and a Look to the
Future
This article has provided an overview of the literature on the
nonverbal communication of positive emotions. This research
provides support for three main conclusions. Firstly, this
work shows that there are a range of expressions that com-
municate positive emotions. The study of a wide range of
nonverbal cues is crucial, as many emotions are only reliably
communicated via one channel of communication or a combi-
nation of channels. Secondly, the reviewed results demon-
strate that there are a number of positive emotions that are
associated with unique, recognisable signals. Specifically, the
fact that many of the studies reviewed have found evidence of
recognition of positive emotions, when examining them in the
context of other positive emotions, attests to the signal clarity
of these expressions (see Table 2). Thirdly, the available find-
ings indicate that the notion of emotion families may be use-
ful as a way to distinguish between positive emotions, based
on the associated nonverbal behaviour (see Ellsworth &
Smith, 1988, for evidence based on appraisal profiles). The
epistemological positive emotions (amusement, relief, awe,
and interest) have distinct, recognisable displays via vocal or
facial cues. The recognisability of these signals suggests that
the nonverbal communication of these emotional states may
be adaptive in an evolutionary sense. They may, together with
pride, be the most likely candidates for potentially basic posi-
tive emotions, equivalent to the set of negative emotions that
are reliably communicated via nonverbal signals (e.g., fear,
disgust, anger). The agency-approach positive emotions (ela-
tion and pride) appear to be associated with recognisable
visual, but not auditory, cues. This could indicate that these
emotions are primarily communicated with others in rela-
tively close proximity, since auditory cues (e.g., screams)
may travel further than visual ones (e.g., eyebrow raising).
However, the relatively conspicuous bodily cues associated
with both elation and pride are indicative of signals that could
be inferred from others from a distance. Furthermore, there is
limited data on the production of vocal cues associated with
elation and pride; hopefully future studies will explore this
issue. Evidence is less strong for clear signals of the prosocial
emotions (love, compassion, gratitude, and admiration) in
any modality other than touch. This is consistent with previ-
ous findings that have highlighted the preferential communi-
cation of prosocial emotions via touch and is thought to
reflect the fact that these emotions primarily occur in intimate
relationships (App et al., 2011). Finally, there is little support
for distinct recognisable signals of the savouring positive
emotions (contentment, sensory pleasure, and desire), which
may suggest that these emotions are not associated with com-
municative functions, though they may nevertheless serve
adaptive functions for the individual who is experiencing
them.
The suggestion of some consistencies in patterns of results
within the proposed emotion families is not intended to
imply that these categories are necessarily the best possible
conceptualisation of positive emotion space. Nevertheless,
current evidence points to possible superordinate classes of
positive emotions, in addition to underlining the differentia-
tion between specific positive emotional states. It is also
worth noting that a number of positive emotions have not
been studied at all yet in the context of nonverbal behaviour;
232 Emotion Review Vol. 9 No. 3
future work may for example examine the communication of
ecstasy, devotion, and hope.
These findings overturn some previous assumptions about
the nonverbal communication of positive emotions. Specifi-
cally, all positive emotions were once thought to share a nonver-
bal signal in the form of a smile (e.g., Ekman, 1992). It is well
established that smiling does not always provide a direct read-
out of felt enjoyment (e.g., Kraut & Johnston, 1979), but the
findings reviewed here go beyond this point to reveal that some
positive emotions, like interest, are reliably expressed and rec-
ognised by facial cues other than smiling. In addition, some
positive emotional states are reliably communicated via nonfa-
cial signals. Smiling may nevertheless provide a signal of gen-
eral positive emotion or prosocial orientation, but the available
data suggests that more detailed characterisations of configura-
tions of cues are likely more informative than using single,
global descriptive categories such as smiling.
The present review included only studies with adult par-
ticipants, but it is worth considering how this work connects to
the developmental literature (reviewed in Sauter et al., 2014).
It is well established that already very early in development,
infants are sensitive to nonverbal signals of positive emotion
from others and also that they produce such signals them-
selves. There is, for example, evidence that infants produce
laughter in response to playful physical games. Notably, simi-
larities between developmental and adult samples have been
found across multiple modalities. Even very young infants
show differentiation between different kinds of smiles in both
perception and production, but little work focusing on early
development has included comparisons between multiple
kinds of positive emotions. Research on emotion perception in
older children has in some cases included several positive
emotions and shown considerable differentiation, but data on
many aspects of the development of nonverbal communication
of specific positive emotions are lacking. Addressing this gap
in the research literature will be a worthwhile challenge for
future research.
It is worth noting some limitations of the extant data, particu-
larly as this may inform further research pursuits in this field.
There is a great need for more cross-cultural research in the
study of nonverbal communication of positive emotions. With
the exception of a handful of studies noted in the relevant sec-
tions, the displays of most positive emotions have not been
tested across cultures for any channel of communication. It is
well established that cultures vary in their orientations to differ-
ent types of positive affect (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006), but
the extent to which culture shapes emotional signals varies
greatly across positive emotions (e.g., Sauter, Eisner, Ekman,
et al., 2010). More research in this area is thus needed, particu-
larly given the importance of cross-cultural findings for evolu-
tionary arguments on emotions.
A number of studies have demonstrated a communication
advantage for multimodal expressions (e.g., Bänziger et al.,
2012). The vast majority of studies to date have focused on
expressions within a single modality. Research on unimodal
communication can provide a tough test of emotion recognition,
but including multimodal expressions will be an important next
step to increasing ecological validity. Relatedly, it is an obvious
limitation that so much of this research relies on posed emo-
tional expressions; here the study of positive emotions has an
advantage compared to that of negative emotions in that there
are generally fewer ethical concerns with inducing intense emo-
tional experiences in the laboratory.
Finally, there is enormous variability in terms of the meas-
ures, target emotions, and paradigms in the studies conducted to
date. Although open exploration is crucial for discovery, hope-
fully the maturation of this field of research will begin to yield
greater convergence on methods and emotions over the coming
years.
