Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the effect of parecoxib on preventing postoperative shivering.
Methods: Main outcomes were the relative risk (odds ratio, OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)
relative to the incidence of shivering.
Results: Fourteen trials with 1,175 patients were analyzed. The pooled evidence suggested that
parecoxib sodium, given before anesthesia or postoperatively (only 4 cases), had the potential to
prevent postoperative shivering (OR ¼ 0.21, 95% CI, 0.16, 0.29). Compared with the placebo,
parecoxib sodium significantly lowered the incidence of postoperative shivering as follows: mild
shivering [OR ¼ 0.51, 95% CI (0.35, 0.74)]; moderate shivering [OR ¼ 0.28, 95% CI (0.18, 0.45)];
severe shivering [OR ¼ 0.18, 95% CI (0.10, 0.33)]. Compared with placebo, there was no significant
association of parecoxib sodium with restlessness [OR ¼ 0.95, 95% CI (0.59, 1.52)] or nausea/
vomiting [OR ¼ 0.24, 95% CI (0.09, 0.66)]. In addition, pethidine rescue was used significantly more
often in the control group than in the parecoxib sodium group [OR ¼ 0.22, 95% CI (0.09, 0.53)].
Conclusions: Parecoxib sodium may be an effective strategy for preventing postoperative
shivering.

Background
Postoperative shivering is common. At least
10%, and as many as 66%, of surgical
patients shiver during the course of recov-
ery.1 Shivering is defined as irregular, spon-
taneous, continuous constriction of muscle
activities for >15 min. It is a physiological
response that can increase the metabolic rate
and maintain normal body temperature to
ensure the continuation of physiological

functions.2 Shivering, however, may incur
severe adverse effects, such as increasing
oxygen consumption and burdening cardio-
pulmonary function.2 It can also elevate
intracranial and intraocular pressures and
increase the risk of myocardial ischemia.2
Thus, shivering is a common complication,
causing patient severe pain and discomfort.
It could have an adverse effect on patients'
physiology and psychology and even
influence the postoperative prognosis.2
In addition, it could also cause the patient
to interfere with the wound, causing
worse pain, and to interrupt monitoring
equipment.1
Burned patients are more likely to shiver.
The mechanism of perioperative shivering is
unclear, but shivering after being burned
may be due primarily to hypothermia,3 a
common complication of severe burns. The
lack of the skin's protection and the high
metabolite rate in burned patients can lower
body temperature by disrupting the evapor-
ation and convection that takes place on
skin.3 Increased heat loss from the skin and
body surfaces increases the risk of lowering
the core body temperature.
Multimodal pain therapy has been
used recently to address postoperative
pain. It involves the use of non-opioid
analgesics, opioids, and co-analgesics.4
Opioids are frequently used to treat pre-
operative and postoperative pain, although
with many severe adverse effects. In con-
trast, non-opioids, such as nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can be
administered to reduce postoperative pain,
with opioid doses given as an adjuvant.4
Parecoxib, the first cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-
2)-selective agent, can be administered intra-
venously or intramuscularly, providing an
advantage for patients experiencing post-
operative nausea and vomiting.4 Unlike
opioids, it does not influence platelet aggre-
gation or lead to gastrointestinal ulceration.
Its few severe side effects include respiratory
depression and excessive sedation.4
Prostaglandin E2
(PGE2
), which plays a
key role in thermoregulatory pathways, has
been shown to affect body temperature and
shivering in animal models. It has also been
reported that overexpression of COX-2 in the
mouse brain intensified the febrile response.1
Thus, parecoxib, being a selective COX-2
inhibitor, may affect perioperative thermo-
regulation by allowing the body to avoid a
shivering response. The mechanism of shiver-
ing is unclear. Shivering after general anes-
thesia may be influenced by low body
temperature, although pain and uncomfort-
able sensations may also be related to post-
operative shivering.1 Parecoxib transforms
into valdecoxib immediately after intramus-
cular injection, which releases its precise,
powerful analgesic effects.1 Hence, shivering
prevention by parecoxib may be related to its
analgesic effects.
Methods
Search strategy and trials selection
The randomized controlled trials included in
this analysis were sought from the following
databases: PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, China National Knowledge
Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Google
Scholar, and Web of Science (January 1985
to October 2016). The following search
terms were included in the search: ``pare-
coxib'', ``parecoxib sodium'', or ``selective
cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor'', and ``shiver''.
References of selected studies were reviewed
for additional trials. Publication languages
were not limited.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were
as follows: (1) the comparison was between
parecoxib and placebo or other drugs in
regard to shivering after neuraxial anesthe-
sia and general anesthesia; (2) the research
objects were humans of any sex and age; (3)
4 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
there were no restrictions on dosing regi-
mens or the route of administration of
parecoxib; (4) the available outcome data
were provided; (5) the experimental group
was given parecoxib, and the controlled
group was given saline; (6) the experimental
group was given parecoxib by intravenous
injection before anesthesia.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
reports were abstracts, duplicate publica-
tions, reviews; (2) they did not report specific
results of the comparison between parecoxib
and placebo.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers independently extracted data
from the included studies. We tabulated the
studies and systematically assessed them for
homogeneity. If any heterogeneity between
the studies did not have justified pooling of
the assessed outcome parameters, it was
settled by discussion with a third review
author. The two reviewers solved any dis-
agreement on included studies, quality
assessment, data extraction, and outcome
parameters through discussion until total
agreement was conceded. They recorded
each study's authors, publication year,
number of patients, intervention measures,
age and sex of the patients, number of
withdrawals, outcome parameters, study
methodology, and anesthetic type onto a
customized data extraction form described
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions. If necessary, we
contacted the corresponding authors for
further information.
The group allocation was concealed
by using a random number generator.
The results were placed in consecutively
sealed numbered envelopes by a third party
not involved in the trial. Two authors and
a third author independently assessed the
risk of bias for each research according
to the four items of the Oxford scale,
which include the reporting and adequacy
of randomization (0­2 points), allocation
concealment (0­1 point), double blinding
(0­2 points), and description of dropouts (0­
2 points). The items were then summed, with
the summary scores varying from 0 to 7.

Statistical analysis
The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical
software (RevMan 5.0) was used to assess
the quantitative data during the statistical
analysis. Classification results were assessed
with the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI). For continuous outcome data,
the weighted mean difference or standardized
mean difference was estimated by means
and standard deviations. For dichotomous
outcomes, the Peto OR was estimated.

The Cochran Q-Statistics 2 test and incon-
sistency index (I2) were applied to estimate
statistical heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was
assessed with the I2 test. If the outcome data
had low heterogeneity (I2 < 50%), a fixed-
effects model was chosen. If the outcome data
had high heterogeneity (I2 > 50%), a
random-effects model was used to analyze
it. A value P < 0.05 was considered to indi-
cate statistical significance.
Results
We found 1274 potential studies from the
databases. The detailed screening flow is
shown in Figure 1. After screening the titles
and abstracts and after full-text screening,
14 studies were selected from our database
(Figure 1). The detailed characteristics of
14 articles5­18 in this meta-analysis are
shown in Table 1.
In all, 1175 patients were involved in the
14 included trials. Among them, 602 were
given parecoxib sodium, 573 a placebo, and
90 tramadol. The parecoxib sodium dose,
which was 40 mg in each case, was given to
almost all the subjects before anesthesia.
Only four patients received it at the end of
the surgery.
The pooled evidence suggested that par-
ecoxib sodium had the potential to prevent
postoperative shivering (OR ¼ 0.21, 95%
CI, 0.16, 0.29) (Figure 2). No heterogeneity
(P ¼ 0.47, I2 ¼ 0%) was found.
In all RCTs (n ¼ 1175 patients), all
patients reported on the presence of mild
shivering. As no statistical heterogeneity
(P ¼ 0.62, I2 ¼ 0%) was found among the
studies, a fixed-effects model was employed
for the meta-analysis. The results showed
that there was a distinctive difference
[OR ¼ 0.51, 95% CI (0.35, 0.74), P ¼
0.0004] between the parecoxib sodium
group and the control group regarding the
incidence of mild shivering (Table 2).
In all RCTs (n ¼ 1175 patients), all
patients reported on the presence of moder-
ate shivering. As no statistical heterogeneity
(P ¼ 0.97, I2 ¼ 0%) was found among the
studies, a fixed-effects model was employed
for the meta-analysis. The results showed
that there was a distinctive difference

[OR ¼ 0.28 ,95% CI (0.18, 0.45),
P < 0.00001] between the parecoxib sodium
group and the controls regarding the inci-
dence of moderate shivering (Table 2).
In all RCTs (n ¼ 1175 patients), all
patients reported on the presence of severe
shivering. As no statistical heterogeneity
(P ¼ 1.00, I2 ¼ 0%) was found among the
studies, a fixed-effects model was employed
for the meta-analysis. The results showed

P < 0.00001] between the parecoxib sodium
group and the controls regarding the inci-
dence of severe shivering (Table 2).
The appearance of adverse reactions in
regard to the use of parecoxib sodium versus
tramadol was analyzed with a limited test
power. Compared with placebo, there was
no significant association of parecoxib
sodium with avoidance of nausea/vomiting
[OR ¼ 0.95, 95% CI (0.59, 1.52), P ¼ 0.83]
Table 2 or restlessness [OR ¼ 0.24 , 95% CI
(0.09, 0.66), P ¼ 0.006] (Table 2). Compared
with placebo, however, the results showed
that there were distinctive differences
[OR ¼ 0.22, 95% CI (0.09, 0.53),
P < 0.0009] between the parecoxib sodium
group and the controls regarding the
number of patients who required pethidine
rescue (Table 2).
Discussion and conclusion
Based on our results, paracoxib sodium
decreased the incidence of post-operative
shivering. In addition, compared with the
placebo group, there was no significant
association of parecoxib sodium with alle-
viation of restlessness or nausea/vomiting.
In contrast, however, significantly more
patients in the control group required peth-
idine rescue than did those in the parecoxib
sodium group.
This meta-analysis suggested that para-
coxib is significantly effective in reducing
postoperative shivering with fewer side
effects (e.g., sedation, nausea/vomiting).
Studies of prophylactic use of paracoxib
have been reported.19,20 A feasible mechan-
ism for the effect of paracoxib on shivering
may be its inhibition of COX-2 and the
synthesis of prostagladins. COX-2 and
PGE2
play important roles in the hypothal-
amus in regard to mediating fever.21 Thus,
COX-2 specific inhibitors could lower the
threshold of the thermoregulatory system
located in the anterior hypothalamus.
Accordingly, paracoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor,
may affect perioperative thermoregulation
and shivering.
There have been no previously reported
studies of prophylactic administration of

paracoxib to prevent shivering in burned
patients. It is reported that, other than
skin, the lungs, liver, and intestines are
affected by inflammation after a burn.22
In the context of the gut, burn injuries
may cause mesenteric vasoconstriction and
induce hypoxia.23 Studies have shown that
paracoxib exhibits gastroprotective effect-
iveness with low cardiovascular risk.24 Burn
injuries give rise to the release of pro-
inflammatory mediators, which cause local
and systematic inflammation. Secondary
to systematic inflammatory, severe burns
may cause serious adverse reactions, such
as multiple organ dysfunction, especially
of the lung, the first organ to fail.25 It has
been suggested that inhibition of COX-2
decreases acute lung injury and inhibits
PGE2
found in the plasma of seriously
burned patients, which can significantly
increase immune system dysfunction after
a burn injury.26
The potential limitations of this study
should be taken into consideration. First,
the small sample size may influence the
results to some degree. Second, many of
the included studies did not include infor-
mation on simultaneous adverse reactions
with their presentation data.
