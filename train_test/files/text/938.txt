Self-Insured Employer Health Plans: Prevalence, Profile,
Provisions, And Premiums
by Gregory Acs, Stephen H. Long, M. Susan Marquis, and Pamela
Farley Short
Abstract: Data from three recent surveys indicate that about 40 percent of workers with employment-
based health insurance are enrolled in plans that their employers self-insure. Despite the considerable
differences between federal regulation of these self-insured plans and state regulation of employer
plans purchased from an insurance company, we find striking similarities in the populations they serve,
the benefits they offer, and their premium costs. Implications for health policy are discussed.
Responsibility for regulating employer-sponsored health benefit plans
is divided between state and federal governments. Traditionally, state
governments had the authority to regulate the insurance business.
Since its passage in 1974, however, the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) preempts state laws affecting self-insured employer
plans. Hence, these self-insured plans are subject only to federal oversight
by the Department of Labor. State insurance commissioners continue to
regulate insurance companies, thereby affecting employer-sponsored plans
that are purchased from insurers.
Although the division of responsibility is clear in theory, the states, the
Department of Labor, the courts, and Congress have struggled to define it
in practice. For example, because some avowedly self-insured employers
shift much of their risk onto others through reinsurance and capitation
arrangements, the definition of self-insurance is an issue. Whether certain
state laws have enough of an effect on employee benefits to trigger the
ERISA preemption also has been a question.
The state and federal regulatory regimes are quite different. State govern-
ments impose reserve requirements on health insurers to minimize the risk
of insolvency; they impose premium taxes to finance state guaranty funds to
pay the claims of insolvent plans and, in some states, to establish high-risk
pools to cover the uninsurable; and they mandate certain types of benefits
in plans marketed in their state. Some states also regulate rating and

underwriting practices in the small-group market. In contrast, ERISA re-
quirements on health plans are far more limited. They deal with reporting
requirements, the disclosure of information to employees, and the regula-
tory interpretation of the fiduciary responsibility of plan administrators.
The ERISA preemption is very controversial. Proponents argue that it
has permitted employers to develop innovative solutions to containing
health care costs.1 They assert that employers have led the way in negotiat-
ing with provider networks, developing plan performance measures, and
developing new risk-based payment arrangements to provide financial in-
centives to providers to hold down costs. They believe that employers
would not have had the flexibility to adopt these strategies without the
ERISA preemption. They are particularly concerned that large employers,
which often are the source of innovations, would be handicapped by a
proliferation of state-specific requirements, because large employers tend to
operate in many different states. Furthermore, ERISA proponents contend
that permitting states to include self-insured employers in their rating
reforms--thereby forcing them to pool their claims costs with others--
would weaken employers' financial incentives to reduce costs.
On the other hand, opponents of ERISA view it as an obstacle to
enacting comprehensive health care reform at the state level.2 The law
limits many of the health care financing and cost containment initiatives
that states have considered and encourages legal challenges to these initia-
tives.3 Because self-insured plans do not have to comply with state-
mandated benefits, ERISA prevents states from legislating a minimum
benefit package for all of their residents. Opponents also are concerned that
ERISA does not provide adequate consumer protection, ranging from
methods of dispute resolution to solvency requirements.
Despite these strong views about the implications of the ERISA preemp-
tion, there is little information about firms that self-insure and the differ-
ences between self-insured and fully insured health plans. What shares of
the market are now under federal versus state jurisdiction? What distin-
guishes firms that self-insure from those that purchase insurance? Have the
two regulatory regimes fostered two different systems of employer-sponsored
insurance, with different benefit provisions and different premiums?
Virtually any reform proposal affecting the private employment-based
health insurance market must deal with the issue of continuing or modify-
ing the current regulatory distinction between self-insured and purchased
plans. For example, during the recent national health care reform debate
there was considerable discussion of whether or not to include multistate,
self-insured employers in proposed health insurance purchasing alliances,
on either a mandatory or a voluntary basis. Analysts on both sides of the
debate were uncertain about the number of employees in self-insured plans,

their distribution by size of firm, and the likely demographic and health
profile of alliances formed voluntarily. As the impetus for reform has shifted
from the national to the state level, and the scope of legislative proposals
from universal to incremental, the unanswered questions remain much the
same. This paper addresses these questions.
Methods
We tabulate data from three recent surveys with information about
self-insured plans: the 1991 Health Insurance Association of America
(HIAA) survey, the 1993 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Em-
ployer Health Insurance Survey, and the 1987 National Medical Expendi-
ture Survey (NMES). The first two sources are surveys of employers, while
the third is a survey of households.
The HIAA survey contains the responses of 3,323 firms nationwide that
responded to a telephone interview; the survey response rate was 71 per-
cent.4 The RWJF survey, part of the foundation's State Initiatives in Health
Care Reform program, permits state-specific estimates for ten states.5 Tele-
phone interviews with approximately 2,000 establishments--about three-
fourths with fifty or fewer employees--were completed in each state, for a
total of 22,347 interviews. The response rate was 71 percent.6
Both employer surveys collected data about the number and charac-
teristics of the persons employed by the business and about the insurance
plans offered. The survey respondent was asked to report whether each plan
was self-insured or fully insured.7 We use these data to make estimates of the
number and characteristics of employees in businesses that offered a self-
insured plan. We refer to these as "self-insured employers," although many
of them also offered a fully insured plan. We also use the employer surveys
to estimate the share of employees enrolled in self-insured and fully insured
plans, and to compare the benefits and premiums for workers in self-insured
plans with those in fully insured plans.8
For information about the characteristics of employees who actually
enroll in self-insured or fully insured plans, we use NMES, sponsored by the
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research in the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services. Approximately 15,000 households were inter-
viewed about every four months to collect information about their health
insurance during 1987. NMES contacted employers, unions, and insurance
companies that provided insurance for household members to verify enroll-
ment, determine premiums and payment sources, and obtain information
about the plan, including whether or not it was self-insured. We base our
estimates on 6,489 policyholders in the household and follow-up surveys.9
Among the households completing all rounds of household interviewing,

the response rate for the follow-up survey was 62 percent.
All three surveys provide information about the health insurance spon-
sored by private employers of all sizes. We exclude self-employed persons
with no employees.10 The NMES data include all public employers; the
HIAA survey includes only state and local government employers; and
public employers are excluded from the RWJF tabulations reported here.
The RWJF and NMES data include union-sponsored plans, but they are not
included in the HIAA data.
Results
Prevalence of self-insurance. The three surveys indicate that 32-42
percent of workers who enroll for employer-sponsored health benefits are in
a self-insured plan (Exhibit l).11 This rate varies greatly with firm size.
Fewer than one in six insured employees in smaller firms (100 employees or
fewer) are enrolled in a self-insured plan, whereas about 60 percent of
insured workers in the largest firms are in a self-insured plan. While the
majority of insured workers in large firms are in self-insured plans, even in
large firms a substantial share of insured workers are in fully insured plans.
Moreover, most workers in self-insured plans are in a plan whose risk has
been limited by the employer through a reinsurance arrangement.
The concentration of self-insured plans in large firms also is evident from
the distribution of enrollees in self-insured plans by size of firm (Exhibit 2).
The surveys indicate that 60-75 percent of employees in self-insured plans
are in firms with more than 500 employees. In contrast, almost half of

employees in fully insured plans work for firms with 100 or fewer employees;
fewer than one-third work for the largest firms.
All three data sources suggest that there are geographic differences in the
extent of self-insurance. The two national surveys show regional variation.
There are more workers in self-insured plans in the Midwest and South
than in the Northeast and West (Exhibit 3). However, looking at the
state-specific results from the RWJF survey, we find that differences be-
tween states within a region are as large as or larger than differences across
regions. Others have shown that interstate differences in insurance regula-
tion were a factor leading firms to self-insure in the early and mid-1980s.12
Choice among plans. Many workers in firms with a self-insured plan
("self-insured businesses" in Exhibit 4) can choose among multiple plans
offered. Between 50 and 65 percent work for employers with more than one
health insurance option. Because self-insurance and choice are both com-
mon among large employers, those who work for self-insured employers
have more health plan choices than those who work for employers with
only fully insured plans. However, when we look at large employers only, we
see similar proportions of employees in firms with self-insured plans and
with only fully insured plans who are offered multiple options.
Forty percent of workers in self-insured firms also are offered a fully
insured plan. The most common option is a health maintenance organiza-
tion (HMO). About 30 percent of workers in firms that offer a self-insured
plan have a choice between it and an HMO, and about 9 percent are
offered both an HMO and a fully insured indemnity or preferred provider
organization (PPO) plan in addition to the self-insured plan.

Profile of employees. Next, we consider whether there are differences
between workers in self-insured businesses or plans and those in fully
insured businesses or plans. From the two employer surveys (RWJF and
HIAA), we compare characteristics of all workers in businesses offering a
self-insured plan with those of workers in fully insured businesses, whether
or not the workers enroll in a plan. This comparison provides information
about differences in the workforces of employers that make different deci-
sions about self-insuring. From NMES, we compare the workers who enroll
in a self-insured plan with workers who enroll in a fully insured plan. This
comparison provides information about differences in the populations
served by self-insured and fully insured plans.
Exhibit 5 shows few differences between employees in businesses that do
and do not offer a self-insured plan and between enrollees in self-insured
plans and fully insured plans. All three surveys indicate that employees in
self-insured businesses or in self-insured plans have higher earnings, but
these differences are small. Differences in other demographic characteristics
are also slight and do not show a consistent pattern across the surveys.13
Employees who work for businesses that offer a self-insured plan are more
likely than those in other businesses are to be union members; hence,
employees in self-insured plans are more likely to be union members. This
occurs because large firms are more likely to offer a self-insured plan and
more likely to have union workers.

Provisions and premiums. The benefits available to workers in self-
insured plans are quite similar to those available to workers in fully insured
indemnity or PPO plans (Exhibit 6). The employer surveys indicate that
the benefits held by those in self-insured plans are somewhat broader and
deeper than those held by employees in fully insured indemnity and PPO
plans.14 However, the NMES estimates suggest that these differences are
small when translated into actuarial value, expressed as the average share of
health care spending that a plan covers. Workers in fully insured HMO
plans have more generous coverage than workers in self-insured plans or
other fully insured plans have, when judged by this actuarial value measure.
All of our sources also show that the average monthly premiums for
workers in self-insured and fully insured indemnity or PPO plans are similar
(Exhibit 7). The difference between self-insured and fully insured premi-
ums for single coverage ranges between 3 percent and 13 percent ($5-$20

the self-insured primarily work for large employers, and administrative costs

Discussion
Nationwide, about 60 percent of employees are covered under health
insurance plans that are fully insured and fall under state regulation; the
other 40 percent are covered under self-insured plans that are subject to
federal oversight. There is considerable variation in this proportion among
states, with federal regulation governing more than half of the market in
some states. There is also variation by firm size. About 85 percent of insured
workers in firms with fewer than 100 employees are in plans under state
jurisdiction, whereas states regulate plans covering only about 40 percent of
insured workers in firms with more than 500 employees.
Despite the marked contrast between the state and federal regulatory
regimes, we find a great deal of similarity between self-insured and fully
insured plans. They serve similar populations, offer similar benefits, and
have similar premium costs.
Several factors may account for these similarities. The demographic

similarities between enrollees may reflect the insurance industry's reliance
on experience rating for large employers that buy traditional insurance.
With experience rating, a firm's premium is based on the health risks of its
own employees, even if it is fully insured. It does not have to self-insure to
avoid pooling claims with firms whose workers have less favorable demo-
graphics that might raise premiums.
The similarities in benefit design may suggest that employers' choices
with respect to plan design are constrained by the preferences of employees,
regardless of whether or not the plan is self-insured. Our analysis shows that
employees in fully insured and self-insured plans are similar in many char-
acteristics that are related to the demand for insurance; hence, one would
expect the plan benefits to be similar as well. The broad coverage standards
set by the HMO Act of 1973 for federally qualified HMOs may serve to
constrain the range of options as well, if consumers or employers view them
as a federal statement of the minimum necessary coverage.
The similarities between the different types of plans may also indicate
that fully insured and self-insured plans continue to compete with each
other to a significant extent, despite playing under different rules. As noted
above, a sizable share of policies in large firms--which are in the best
position to self-insure--remain fully insured.
Some critics of the dual regulatory regime express concern about the lack
of solvency standards for plans under federal regulation. Our results suggest
that workers in self-insured plans may not be at greater risk than workers in
fully insured plans, at least with respect to financing the uncommon event
of one or more extremely high cost cases. Most self-insured plans include a
reinsurance mechanism. In addition, most self-insured plans are sponsored
by large employers and therefore enjoy the benefit of pooling risks over
many covered lives. Our data, however, do not permit us to address a second
dimension of solvency--the adequacy of reserves.
The similarities among the self-insured and fully insured plans have a
number of implications for state and national health policy. First, the
similarity in benefits indicates that past state policies related to mandated
benefits have not driven firms to self-insure in order to escape the cost of
providing these benefits. Similarly, Gail Jensen and colleagues found that
although state mandates may have been a factor leading to the decision to
self-insure in the early 1980s, they have not been a major factor encourag-
ing self-insurance in more recent years.16 Moreover, the trend to self-
funding among large firms may have leveled off in recent years as these
employers have turned to managed care plans--still primarily purchased--
to contain costs.
Second, there are few differences in premiums and demographic charac-
teristics, suggesting that self-insured plans do not enroll a more favorable

selection of health risks than fully insured plans enroll Thus, premiums in
state or national health alliances and purchasing cooperatives are unlikely
to be affected by decisions to include or exclude self-insured plans.
The similarities between the different types of plans also may make it
easier to contemplate unified reforms that would apply to both types of
plans. There do not appear to be major differences between the two types of
plans that would justify special treatment for one or the other.
Finally, our findings suggest that ERISA may not present significant
obstacles to effective implementation of many of the current state initia-
tives that focus on insurance rating, underwriting, and purchasing reforms
for small businesses. Although ERISA has led to a division in the employer-
sponsored insurance market between plans governed by state regulation
and those operated under federal rules, our data show that this division is
largely related to firm size. Most policies offered by small businesses are fully
insured and, therefore, are under the purview of state regulators. Although
this suggests that state efforts to reform the small-group market are not
limited at present, the picture could change if small businesses claim to
self-fund by buying low-deductible reinsurance.

for this differential nonresponse. The unit interviewed was the establishment; however,
here we classify employers and workers by the size of the firm, not the establishment,
for comparison with the HIAA and NMES results.
7. The respondent's report was used to classify plans as self-insured or fully insured.
Reinsurance and its extent was not taken into account. For example, a reinsurance
policy that pays when claims exceed $1,000 may be called "self-insured with reinsur-
ance" by a business that seeks exemption from state regulation under ERISA, while
state regulators would view the reinsurance policy as primary coverage.
8. The HIAA survey limited questions about plan characteristics to the largest plan
offered among four different types (conventional, HMO, PPO, and point-of-service).
Thus, if the self-insured plan was not the largest of its type, we might undercount the
number of employees in self-insured firms. On the other hand, we may overstate
enrollment in other firms. We attribute all of the enrollment for a particular type of
plan to the largest plan of that type. Thus, enrollment in a self-insured plan would be
overstated if the employer offered a smaller but fully insured plan of the same type.

10. NMES estimates show this population at 5.4 million. Only 11 percent hold an
employment-based policy, so their omission will have little effect on our estimates. See

Does Differential Taxation Make a Difference?" Inquiry (Fall 1993): 293-305.
11. Dependents and retirees account for a somewhat higher proportion of the total
enrollment in self-insured plans than in fully insured plans, based on NMES tabulations
not shown here. Thus, self-insured plans encompass a larger share of the covered lives
in employer-sponsored plans (47 percent) than their share of active workers.
12. For example, see G.A. Jensen, K.D. Cotter, and M.A. Morrisey, "State Insurance
Regulation and Employers' Decisions to Self-Insure,"Journal ofRisk and Insurance (June
1995): 185-213.
13. The similarity of demographic characteristics extends to all enrollees--active workers,
dependents, and former workers--based on NMES tabulations not shown here.
14. Deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for employees in self-insured plans are lower
than those for workers in fully insured indemnity and PPO plans. Those in self-insured
plans are more likely to have coverage for special services such as prescription drugs
and dental care. Our survey data do not reveal differences in administrative practices
that deny coverage under special circumstances. In cases of dispute, consumers have
recourse to state insurance regulatory processes when covered by a fully insured plan,
but there is no corresponding relief under self-insured plans.
15. "Premiums" for self-insured plans are difficult to measure because there is not an
observed transaction between the employer and the insurer. Surveys use different
approaches to measure these premiums. The RWJF survey asked respondents to report
a premium equivalent. The premium equivalent includes administrative costs. The
administrative cost is imputed for self-insured plans that report a premium equivalent
that reflects only claims payment. The HIAA premiums for self-insured plans are based
on the subset of plans for which employers regularly put aside monthly allotments.
Administrative costs are included if they are part of this allotment. The NMES
premiums were imputed from the total funding (including administrative costs) of
self-insured plans that provided this information.
