OBJECTIVE -- The purpose of this study was to examine whether glycemic control has
improved in recent years among individuals with diagnosed diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We examined trends in A1C levels for adults
with diagnosed diabetes using three consecutive waves of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES): 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004. We estimated mean
A1C levels and the proportion with A1C 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0%. We used multivariate regres-
sion to test whether A1C levels differed by NHANES wave after controlling for other factors.
Multivariate dichotomous logistic regression and predictive margins were used to test whether
the percentages of individuals with diabetes in selected A1C intervals differed by NHANES wave.
RESULTS -- Mean A1C levels among individuals with diagnosed diabetes declined from
7.82% in 1999­2000 to 7.47 and 7.18% in 2001­2002 and 2003­2004, respectively. After
controlling for demographics and diabetes duration, A1C levels were 0.308 (P  0.20) and 0.511
(P  0.03) percentage points lower in 2001­2002 and 2003­2004, respectively, than in 1999­
2000. The logistic results indicated corresponding improvements over time: the predictive
margin for having A1C 7.0% increased from 37.0% in 1999­2000 to 49.7% in 2001­2002
and to 55.7% in 2003­2004.
CONCLUSIONS -- Glycemic control improved between 1999 and 2004. This trend may
represent an important improvement in diabetes care and is encouraging for future reduction of
diabetes-related complications.
Diabetes Care 31:81­86, 2008
Major randomized controlled trials
conducted during the 1990s
demonstrated the importance of
tightly and consistently managing A1C
levels among type 1 and type 2 diabetic
patients (1,2). A follow-up of the Diabetes
Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)
reaffirmed the value of glycemic control
because microvascular complications re-
mained lower among intervention partic-
ipants 7 years after the trial concluded (3).
These and other studies highlighted the
central role of glycemic control in the
management of diabetes. Accordingly,
professional associations, including the
American Association of Clinical Endocri-
nologists (AACE), the American Diabetes
Association (ADA), and the European As-
sociation for the Study of Diabetes
(EASD), established clinical guidelines in
the range of 6.5­7.0% to motivate health
professionals and patients to consistently
manage blood glucose levels (4,5). The
National Diabetes Quality Improvement
Alliance, a private-public entity, devel-
oped national performance measures to
monitor glycemic control and other dia-
betes care processes and outcomes.
Despite the emphasis on glycemic
control, evidence of improvement in A1C
control over time remains scant. In a re-
cent study comparing nationally repre-
sentative data from 1999 ­2002 with
comparable data from 1988­1994, the
mean A1C level declined from 7.8 to
7.7% (not significant at the 5% level)
among adults with self-reported diabetes
(6). The study found some evidence sug-
gesting an improvement in poorly con-
trolled A1C; the percentage of patients
with A1C 9.0% decreased from 24.5 to
20.6%, but this decline was not signifi-
cant at the 5% level. Other studies have
also shown little or no time trend in A1C
levels (7,8); one study (8) reported that
the rate of glycemic control (A1C 7.0%)
fell from 44.5% in 1988­1994 to 35.8%
in 1999­2000. Given the attention on
glycemic control in clinical disease man-
agement and public health programs dur-
ing the past decade, these observations
are both concerning and surprising. In
this study, we examined recent national
trends in glycemic control among adults
with diagnosed diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- We examined data
from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), the
same data source used in the previous
studies (6­8). NHANES is a nationally
representative, population-based survey
designed to collect information on the
health and nutrition of the U.S. civilian
noninstitutionalized population.
NHANES is now an ongoing survey, with
results released in 2-year waves. Survey
details are described elsewhere (9­11).
Participants answer a household inter-
view, and most complete clinical exami-
nations in a mobile examination center.
We focused on the 1999 ­2000,
2001­2002, and 2003­2004 NHANES
waves. This focus allowed us to use the
most recent data to examine recent trends
in glycemic control. We limited our anal-
ysis to adults (aged 18 years) who re-
ported a previous diagnosis of diabetes by
a health care professional and who re-
ceived an A1C measurement.
Blood specimens were processed,
stored, and shipped to the Diabetes Diag-
nostic Laboratory at the University of Mis-

souri­Columbia for analysis of A1C,
using Primus CLC330 and Primus
CLC385. The system was standardized to
the reference method used in the DCCT.
We included data from 403, 448, and 482
individuals in, respectively, the 1999­
2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004
waves.
We estimated mean A1C levels for in-
dividuals reporting diagnosed diabetes
for each of three NHANES data waves, as
well as the percentages of the population
with A1C 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0%. We
applied multivariate regression to test
whether A1C levels differed among
NHANES waves after controlling for age,
sex, race/ethnicity, education, BMI, insur-
ance status, income, and duration of dia-
betes. We estimated a second
specification that also included treatment
variables (diabetes pills only, insulin only,
and both pills and insulin; the omitted
treatment variable was diet only).
We used multivariate dichotomous
logistic regression to test whether the per-
centage of individuals with A1C 7.0,
8.0, and 9.0% differed significantly in
the 2001­2002 and 2003­2004 waves
relative to the 1999­2000 wave. These
cutoffs can be interpreted as different
benchmarks for glycemic control. We
also used multivariate logistic regression
analyses to compute predictive margins
(12). The predictive margin for a wave
represents the average predicted response
if the entire sample (i.e., everyone in the
1999 ­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­
2004 waves) had been in that wave. Re-
sults were judged to be significant if P 
0.05. We conducted statistical analyses
using Stata 9.2 and SAS-callable SUDAAN
(version 9.0.1) in Linux (version 9.1.3) to
produce point estimates and standard er-
rors that used sampling weights to ac-
count for the complex survey sampling
design.
RESULTS -- The characteristics of in-
dividuals reporting diabetes and receiving
an A1C measurement were relatively con-
sistent among the NHANES waves (Table
1). Education was the only characteristic
with significant changes between 1999­
2000 and the last two waves.
Mean A1C levels among study partic-
ipants with diagnosed diabetes were
7.82% in 1999­2000, 7.47% in 2001­
2002, and 7.18% in 2003­2004 (Table
2). Improvements in mean A1C levels
were observed for most subgroups of the
population during the later waves, with
significant univariate reductions for indi-
viduals aged 65 years, women, all ra-
cial/ethnic groups except Hispanic, those
with more than a high school education,
those with BMI 30 and BMI 30 kg/m2,
those of both income levels, those with
insurance, those with diabetes duration
5 years and between 5 and 14 years,
those who formerly or never smoked, and
those treated with diabetes pills only or
diet only. Only Hispanics had a higher
mean A1C in 2003­2004 than in 1999­
2000.
The A1C interval data show a corre-
sponding shift to the left (Table 2 and Fig.
1). The percentage of the overall popula-
tion with A1C 7.0% increased from
36.9% in 1999­2000 to 49.4% in 2001­
2002 and to 56.8% in 2003­2004. Im-
provements were observed for every
subgroup of the population shown in Ta-
ble 2; many but not all of the subgroup
improvements reached statistical signifi-
cance in 2003­2004. The distribution by
A1C interval in Fig. 1 shows that the per-
centage of individuals with A1C 6% in-
creased from 12.9% in 1999­2000 to
21.8% in 2003­2004. In addition, poor
glycemic control (A1C 9.0%) was lower
in 2003­2004 than in previous waves
(12.4 vs. 21.0% in 1999 ­2000 and
17.8% in 2001­2002).

dicate that mean A1C levels were 0.308
percentage points (P  0.20) lower in
2001­2002 and 0.511 percentage points
(P  0.03) lower in 2003­2004 than in
1999­2000 (Table 3; no treatment vari-
ables included). After controls for other
factors, the differences in waves were less
than those in univariate means. However,
the mean A1C level for the 2003­2004
wave was still significantly lower than that
for the 1999­2000 waves. The coeffi-
cients for 2001­2002 and 2003­2004
were virtually unchanged when treatment
variables were included in the regression.
The treatment effects were associated
with higher A1C levels, probably because
the treatments were prescribed when A1C
was not controlled by diet only.
The multivariate logistic results indi-
cate corresponding improvements over
time in the benchmarks for glycemic con-
trol (Table 4). The odds ratios (ORs) for
2001­2002 and 2003­2004 were always
1.0, and both the difference between
the 2001­2002 and 1999­2000 waves
(P  0.04) and the difference between the
2003­2004 and 1999­2000 waves (P 
0.002) were significant for A1C 7.0%.
The difference between the 2003­2004
wave and the 1999­2000 wave was also
significant for A1C 8.0% (P  0.004).
The OR for the 2003­2004 wave for A1C
9.0% was not significant (P  0.12),
possibly because the 1999­2000 predic-
tive margin was already high. The predic-
tive margins convey the scale of the
changes across NHANES waves; for all in-
dividuals in the sample and with no treat-
ment variables included, the predictive

margin for having A1C 7.0% increased
from 37.0% in 1999­2000 to 49.7% in
2001­2002 and to 55.7% in 2003­2004.

fect on the ORs and predictive margins.
CONCLUSIONS -- A previous re-
port using NHANES data indicated that
processes of diabetes care improved be-
tween 1988­1994 and 1999­2002 (6).
Much smaller changes in intermediate
outcomes, such as A1C and blood pres-
sure, accompanied these improvements;
reported changes in A1C were small and
not significant. Harris et al. (13) reported
a mean A1C of 7.6% for NHANES III
(1988­1994), and Saaddine et al. (6), us-
ing a slightly different data cut, reported
that mean A1C fell from 7.8% in
NHANES III to 7.7% in NHANES 1999­
2002. Another study reported that the
percentage of individuals achieving opti-
mal control fell between NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2000 (8). From a public
health and clinical perspective, these
findings were disappointing because gly-
cemic control had long been emphasized
as a key tenet in diabetes care.
In this context, our finding that A1C
levels decreased significantly between
1999­2000 and 2003­2004 may indi-
cate that diabetes care improved dramat-
ically between 1999 and 2004. Several
factors could explain the decrease in A1C
levels in recent years. After publication of
the DCCT and UK Prospective Diabetes
Study (UKPDS) results, clinical guide-
lines for diabetes care were strengthened,
with adoption of lower goals for A1C.
Health plans embraced multifaceted dis-
ease management programs to improve
care and reduce A1C levels. These plans
were targeted to health systems and pro-
viders as well as to patients with diabetes.
National public health awareness pro-
grams, including those promoted by the
National Diabetes Education Program,
the National Diabetes Quality Improve-
ment Alliance, and several professional
organizations (ADA, EASD, and AACE),
emphasized improved glycemic control
along with cardiovascular risk factor con-
trol. Improved measurement and report-
ing of diabetes care in health plans may
have further motivated glycemic control
efforts. At the same time, new drugs be-
came available in the U.S., including met-
formin (available by brand name since
1995 and as a generic drug since 2002)
and the thiazolidinediones (available in
current brands since 1999). Patient ad-
herence to therapy may have increased,
possibly due to improved diabetes educa-
tion and/or fewer side effects from medi-

cation. Medicare also increased coverage
for diabetes-related supplies during this
period. Whether these or other factors
can explain the decrease in mean A1C lev-
els is a topic for future research.
Our findings will be strengthened if
they are confirmed by analyses of other
datasets and future NHANES waves.
Nonetheless, our analysis has certain
strengths. The NHANES sample is nation-
ally representative and has a sufficient
sample size to detect differences between
time periods. Uniform methods were
used for the diabetes section of NHANES,
and A1C values were assessed by a single
laboratory with close attention to quality
of control and measurement. Our results
are significant even after we controlled for
demographic variables in the multivariate
analysis. The fact that mean A1C was
lower in 2001­2002 than in 1999­2000
and then lower still in 2003­2004, both
for the entire sample and for most demo-
graphic groups (Table 2), further suggests
that there was a real trend in A1C levels.
Our analysis has at least two potential
limitations. First, diabetes status was self-
reported and, in the absence of a clinical
patient history, some individuals in the
sample might not have had diabetes and
would thus be expected to have A1C lev-
els near normal. However, previous stud-
ies have suggested that the self-reported
diabetes variable has high reproducibility
and validity (14,15), and there is little rea-
son to believe that errors in self-reporting
would increase over time. Second, al-
though respondents reported time since
diagnosis of diabetes, information on di-
abetes onset is not available. It is possible
that earlier detection of diabetes in recent
years could bias the results toward lower
mean A1C. On the other hand, we found
a time trend toward lower A1C levels for
all categories of years of diagnosed dura-
tion, and the percentage of individuals
with duration of diagnosed diabetes 5
years changed little among NHANES
waves. We also controlled for time since
diagnosis in the regression analyses.
However, these results do not fully re-
solve the issue of whether diagnosis has
been occurring closer to onset.
Our findings are encouraging for the
long-term outcomes of patients with dia-
betes. Hazard model estimates based on
10-year outcomes observed in UKPDS
data suggest that a mean 0.511 percentage
point decrease in glycemic level would, if
maintained, produce a 10.7% reduction
in diabetes complications (16) and an im-
portant improvement in diabetes morbid-
ity with accompanying reductions in
complication costs. However, these re-
sults should not breed complacency
about the need for further efforts to
achieve glycemic control. Although aver-
ages are improving, many individuals still
are not meeting the optimal control tar-
gets, and A1C levels and rates of subopti-
mal control are especially high in some
demographic groups. Moreover, our esti-
mated reduction in A1C is only about half
of the average 0.9 percentage point reduc-
tion achieved by intensive glycemic con-
trol in the UKPDS relative to conventional
control (2), suggesting that more im-
provement is possible. Perhaps the best
response to our results is a continuing ef-
fort to make even more progress in the
future both for A1C and for other risk
factors for diabetes complications.
