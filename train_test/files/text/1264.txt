Objective: We hypothesized that low serum selenium was associated with anemia in humans.
Subjects: A total of 2092 adults aged 65 and older, in the third National Nutrition Examination Survey, Phase 2 (1991­1994)
(NHANES III).
Methods: Examination of the relationship between serum selenium and hematological indices in NHANES III.
Results: Anemia, defined by World Health Organization criteria, was present in 12.9%. Mean serum selenium among
non-anemic and anemic adults was 1.60 and 1.51 mmol lÀ1 (P ¼ 0.0003). The prevalence of anemia among adults in the lowest
to highest quartiles of serum selenium was 18.3, 9.5, 9.7 and 6.9%, respectively (P ¼ 0.0005). The proportion of adults in the
lowest quartile of selenium among those who were non-anemic or who had anemia due to nutritional causes, chronic
inflammation, renal disease or unexplained anemia was 9.9, 27.5, 17.5, 24.0 and 15.4%, respectively. An increase in loge
selenium was associated with a reduced risk of anemia (odds ratio per one standard deviation increase 0.75, 95% confidence
interval 0.58­0.97, P ¼ 0.03), adjusting for age, race, education, body mass index and chronic diseases.
Conclusion: Low serum selenium is independently associated with anemia among older men and women in the United States.

Introduction
Anemia is common in older adults, and the prevalence of
anemia increases with advancing age (Beghe
´ et al., 2004;
Woodman et al., 2005). Among older adults, anemia has
been associated with a wide spectrum of adverse outcomes
(Lipschitz, 2003), including reduced quality of life (Thomas,
1998; Valderrabano, 2000), decreased muscle strength
(Cesari et al., 2004), increased disability (Penninx et al.,
2004), higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (Beard et al., 1997)
and increased all-cause mortality among nursing home
residents (Kikuchi et al., 2001), and among moderately to
severely disabled women living in the community (Chaves
et al., 2004). Anemia has also been linked with congestive
heart failure (Silverberg et al., 2000) and impaired cognitive
function (Nissenson, 1992). The reduction of oxygen-
carrying capacity of the blood that occurs with anemia
may account for fatigue, cardiovascular complications and
impaired physical performance (Lipschitz, 2003). Anemia
among older adults is caused by renal failure, chronic
inflammation and nutritional deficiencies, and about
one-third of the anemia is unexplained (Guralnik et al., 2004).
Selenium is an essential trace element and a normal
constituent of the diet. Selenium is a component of
selenoproteins, including selenoenzymes such as glu-
tathione peroxidase, selenoprotein-P and thioredoxin
reductase (Zimmermann and Ko
¨hrle, 2002; Moghadaszadeh
and Beggs, 2006). Serum selenium concentrations seem to
decrease with age (Savarino et al., 2001; Bates et al., 2002)
and are lower in persons with chronic diseases (Bates et al.,
2002). Low serum selenium concentrations have been
associated with increased mortality from cancer (Kok et al.,
1987; Kornitzer et al., 2004) and all-cause mortality among
older women living in the community (Ray et al., 2006). Low
activity of glutathione peroxidase, a major selenoenzyme,
was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular
events among adults with suspected coronary artery disease
(Blankenberg et al., 2003).

Animal and human studies suggest that there is a link
between selenium deficiency and anemia. Among animals,
selenium deficiency is associated with anemia in hens
(Latshaw et al., 1977) and cattle (Morris et al., 1984), but
not rats (Hu et al., 1984). In humans, selenium deficiency
may contribute to anemia among dialysis patients (Hampel
et al., 1985), adults with pulmonary tuberculosis (van Lettow
et al., 2005), adults in Vietnam (Van Nhien et al., 2006) and
disabled older women living in the community (Semba et al.,
2006). However, no information is currently available on
serum selenium concentrations and the risk of anemia in the
older population. We hypothesized that low serum selenium
levels are associated with low hemoglobin among older
adults. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized serum
selenium and hemoglobin among older adults in the
third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1988­1994) (NHANES III).
Methods
The study population consisted of men and women who
participated in phase 2 of NHANES III (1991­1994). Subjects
were sampled using a stratified, multistage probability design
that was representative of a national probability sample of
the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United
States (National Center for Health Statistics, 1994). A full
assessment in NHANES III included a home interview and
examination, including phlebotomy in a mobile examina-
tion center. Some people were unable to come to the mobile
examination center and underwent a modified home
examination that included phlebotomy.
Laboratory methods for NHANES III have been described
in detail elsewhere (Gunter et al., 1996) and are briefly
summarized. Hemoglobin was measured using a Coulter-S-
Plus Jr electronic counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL,
USA). Serum iron was measured colorimetrically (Alpkem
RFA Analyzer, Clackamas, OR, USA). Serum ferritin was
measured using the Quantimmune Ferritin IRMA kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Folate and
vitamin B12
were measured using the Quantaphase Folate
radioassay kit (Bio-Rad). Serum creatinine was measured by
the Jaffe reaction using a Hitachi model 737 multichannel
analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN, USA), and creatinine clearance was computed using the
Cockroft­Gault equation: creatinine clearance (ml minÀ1) ¼
((140Àage) Â kg body weight)/(mgdlÀ1 plasma creatinineÂ 72).
A 15% reduction was given for women (Cockcroft and
Gault, 1976). Serum selenium was measured using a graphite
furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer,
Shelton, CT, USA) with Zeeman background correction
(Niskar et al., 2003).
Anemia was defined as hemoglobin o12 g dlÀ1 for women
and o13 g dlÀ1 for men (World Health Organization, 1968).
Different pathophysiological types of anemia were distin-
guished according to the criteria already used by Guralnik
et al. (2004) in the same study population. Anemia was
divided into types of anemia to gain insight into serum
selenium concentrations within each type of anemia that
was previously described (Guralnik et al., 2004). Among
anemic adults, iron-deficiency anemia was defined as having
two or three of the following criteria: transferrin saturation
rate less than 15%, serum ferritin concentration o12 ng mlÀ1
and erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration greater than
1.24 mM (Looker et al., 1997), folate-deficiency anemia was
defined as red blood cell folate o232.49 nmol lÀ1 or serum
folate o5.89 nmol lÀ1, and anemia due to vitamin B12
deficiency was defined as serum B12
o200 pg mlÀ1. Red
blood cell folate was used for those who were seen in the
mobile examination center, and serum folate was used as the
indicator of folate status for those in the modified home
examination with phlebotomy, since red blood cell folate
was not measured in the home visits. Nutritional anemia was
defined as anemia due to either iron deficiency, folate
deficiency or deficiency in vitamin B12
. Among anemic
adults, the anemia due to chronic inflammation was
defined as serum iron o60 mg dlÀ1, creatinine clearance
X30 ml minÀ1 and no evidence of iron deficiency. Anemia
due to renal disease was defined in the presence of creatinine
clearance o30 ml minÀ1. Unexplained anemia was defined
as anemia that was not due to iron, folate or vitamin B12
deficiencies or due to the anemia of chronic inflammation or
renal disease. The quartiles of selenium were based upon all
participants aged 65 or greater and were defined with cutoffs
of p1.33, 41.33; p1.49, 41.49 and p1.65, 41.65 mmol lÀ1.
The National Center for Health Statistics was the source for
the original data files used in this analysis (US Department of
Health and Human Services, 1996). Prevalence rates and
distributions were estimated for the US population using
probability weights specific to NHANES III. Descriptive
statistics were used to characterize the study population,
provide information on the distribution of biochemical
measurements of micronutrients and calculate the preva-
lence of deficiencies. w2- and trend tests were used to
examine the associations between anemia and dichotomized
covariates. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
was used to examine the relationship between selenium
and anemia, with sequential models adjusting for demo-
graphic, chronic disease, nutritional and inflammation
variables that were significant (Po0.05) in univariate
analyses. Selenium was transformed by loge
to achieve a
normal distribution. To assess the relative strength of
associations between selenium and anemia, odds ratios and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with one standard
deviation increase in loge
selenium were reported. Simple
and multiple linear regression was used to examine the
relationship of selenium and other risk factors with hemo-
globin. Variables that were associated with hemoglobin at a
level of Po0.05 were included as covariates in final multi-
variate linear regression models. Standardized b's were
also reported for each predictor to show the strength of
the associations.

Results
There were 2092 adults (934 men and 1158 women) in phase
2 of NHANES III who had measurements of hemoglobin,
serum selenium and other blood tests to characterize the
causes of anemia. Overall, 270 (12.9%) of the participants
were anemic. The main characteristics of study participants
are shown in Table 1 according to anemia status. Compared
to participants who were not anemic, those anemic were
older (P ¼ 0.007), more likely to have education o12 years
(P ¼ 0.01), to be black (Po0.001) and more often affected by
osteoarthritis (P ¼ 0.01), diabetes (P ¼ 0.003) and renal
disease (Po0.0001). Serum selenium levels were lower in
anemic compared with non-anemic adults (P ¼ 0.0003).
There were borderline differences in body mass index (BMI)
between anemic and non-anemic adults (P ¼ 0.09), and no
significant differences in the prevalence of smoking, hyper-
tension, congestive heart failure, stroke, angina, cancer,
myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease. The pre-
valence of anemia was highest in the lowest quartile and
lowest in the highest quartile of serum selenium (Figure 1).
Multivariate logistic regression models were used to
examine the relationship between different risk factors and
anemia (Table 2). Selenium was strongly and independently
associated with anemia in models adjusted for demographic
factors (model 2) and demographic factors and chronic
diseases (model 3). Multiple linear regression models
were also used to examine the relationship between
serum selenium and hemoglobin (Table 3). Selenium was
significantly associated with hemoglobin in a model
that was adjusted for demographic factors (model 2). In
model 2, for example, each one-unit increase in loge
selenium was associated with an increase of 7.39 g lÀ1
hemoglobin, and male was associated with a 10.09 g lÀ1
increase in hemoglobin. A level of education o12 years was
associated with a decrease of 0.98 g lÀ1 of hemoglobin.
Selenium was related to hemoglobin in a final model
(model 3) (P ¼ 0.06) that was adjusted for demographic
factors, BMI and chronic diseases.
Among the 270 anemic participants, the proportion of
anemia due to nutritional causes, chronic inflammation,
renal disease and unexplained anemia was 35.9, 20.4, 16.3
and 27.4%, respectively. The characteristics of participants
who were non-anemic and who had various types of anemia

renal disease tended to be the oldest (P ¼ 0.0003) and had the
highest proportion with BMI o18.5 kg mÀ2 (P ¼ 0.007).
Mean selenium concentrations were lowest among those
with anemia due to nutritional causes and anemia of chronic
inflammation and highest among those who were non-
anemic (P ¼ 0.009). The prevalence of hypertension was
highest among participants who had anemia of chronic
inflammation (P ¼ 0.02), and the prevalence of diabetes was
highest among those with anemia of chronic inflammation
or unexplained anemia (P ¼ 0.02). The proportion of adults
who were in the lowest quartile of serum selenium in the
categories of non-anemic and anemia due to nutritional
causes, chronic inflammation and/or renal disease, and
unexplained anemia are shown in Figure 2. The highest
proportion of participants with low selenium was in those
with anemia due to nutritional causes and anemia due to
renal disease.
Discussion
This study shows that low serum selenium is an independent
risk factor for anemia among older men and women living in
the community in the United States. Low selenium has not
usually been considered as a possible cause of anemia in
older adults (Balducci, 2003; Guralnik et al., 2004) and has
only been previously implicated in anemia among patients
on hemodialysis (Hampel et al., 1985) or with pulmonary
tuberculosis (van Lettow et al., 2005). However, a correlation
between low plasma selenium concentrations and low
hemoglobin had already been noted in the British National
Diet and Nutrition Survey among 1134 men and women
aged 65 years and older (Bates et al., 2002), and more
recently low serum selenium was found to be associated with
anemia among older disabled women living in the commu-
nity (Semba et al., 2006).
A potential biological mechanism by which low selenium
could contribute to anemia is through maintenance of an
optimal concentration of glutathione peroxidase, a key
antioxidant selenoenzyme, in erythrocytes (Chow and
Chen, 1980). Glutathione peroxidase protects hemoglobin
against oxidation in erythrocytes (Nagababu et al., 2003).
Although there is little direct evidence that serum selenium
is related to erythrocyte and hemoglobin stability in hu-
mans, there is a possible relevant example of erythrocyte
damage due to increased oxidative stress in animals (McPhail
and Sibbald, 1992) with protection by selenium. Livestock
that forage on Brassica (mustard, rape) are susceptible to
brassica anemia in which oxidative stress causes excessive
erythrocyte damage (Prache, 1994), and selenium supple-
mentation has been shown to protect animals against
erythrocyte damage (Rotruck et al., 1972; Gutzwiller, 1991,
1998). If low serum selenium levels are associated with
reduced lifespan of erythrocytes in humans, then it would be
anticipated that selenium deficiency would be associated

with an increased reticulocyte count and high-erythro-
poietin levels. Studies in selenium-deficient pigs suggest that
selenium deficiency limits erythropoiesis but does not affect
red cell half-life (Fontaine et al., 1977). Further studies are
needed to examine this issue.
Another mechanism by which selenium could potentially
contribute to anemia is through modulation of inflamma-
tion. Low serum selenium concentrations were found in
adults with anemia of chronic inflammation. Low serum
selenium concentrations among disabled older women
living in the community were predictive of subsequent rises
in interleukin (IL)-6 (Walston et al., 2006). Thus, selenium
could potentially play a role in the anemia of chronic
inflammation through its relationship with the upregulation
of IL-6 through the redox-sensitive transcription factor
nuclear factor-kB. In turn, IL-6 has been implicated in the
upregulation of hepcidin, the iron regulatory hormone that
blocks iron absorption in the gut and iron release from
macrophages and the liver (Roy and Andrews, 2005). The
role of hepcidin in the anemia of chronic inflammation is
not well understood, and little is known is about the
relationship between selenium levels, hepcidin and anemia.
Another possible mechanism by which selenium could be
involved in the pathogenesis of anemia is through heme
oxygenase-1. Low selenium status can upregulate the activity
of hepatic heme oxygenase-1, which catalyzes the initial step
of heme catabolism and reduces heme to biliverdin, carbon
monoxide and free divalent iron (Mostert et al., 2003; Tron
et al., 2005). Whether upregulation of heme oxygenase-1

plays a role in the relationship of low serum selenium to
anemia is not known.
Given that the study design of NHANES III is cross-
sectional, the direction of the association between low serum
selenium levels and anemia cannot be absolutely deter-
mined. It is possible that anemia causes low serum selenium
concentrations through some uncharacterized mechanism,
but there is less evidence to support such a biological
explanation. The data from animal studies suggest that
selenium deficiency causes anemia (Rotruck et al., 1972;
Latshaw et al., 1977; Morris et al., 1984; Gutzwiller, 1991,
1998), but whether the same biological mechanism is found
in humans would need to be determined by well-designed
controlled clinical trials.
In this study, low levels of serum selenium occurred across
all types of anemia. Anemia in older adults is multifactorial,
and according to one hypothesized mechanism, a reduced
half-life of erythrocytes related to low selenium could
predispose in a general way to anemia. The association
between low serum selenium and anemia may reflect the
complex multisystem decline that occurs with aging and
may possibly be caused by diverse biological mechanisms
rather than the specific mechanisms described above.
The dietary intake of selenium varies widely worldwide, as
selenium concentrations in plant-based foods reflect the
concentrations of selenium in the soil where the plants were
grown. The selenium concentrations in animal sources of
food, in turn, depend upon the selenium content of the
plants used for forage, or whether animal feed was fortified
with selenium. Clinical selenium deficiency is rare and is
seen in Keshan disease, an endemic cardiomyopathy found
in low-selenium areas of China where affected persons may
have serum selenium o0.25 mmol lÀ1 (20 mg lÀ1) (Food and
Nutrition Board, 2000). The current dietary requirements
for selenium by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute
of Medicine are based in part upon maintenance of optimal
levels of selenoproteins in blood, especially plasma
glutathione peroxidase (Food and Nutrition Board, 2000).
The selenium requirement for prevention of chronic
disease has not yet been definitively determined (Thomson,
2004). In addition, the selenium requirements for older
adults are largely extrapolations from the middle-aged
population (Thomson, 2004). The activity of glutathione
peroxidase appears to be optimal when serum selenium
concentrations are at least 1.27 mmol lÀ1 (100 mg lÀ1) or
greater (Food and Nutrition Board, 2000). The baseline
serum selenium concentrations at which there appeared to
be a protective effect of selenium supplementation against
cancer in two US trials were 1.34­1.54 mmol lÀ1 (Thomson,
2004). It is notable that in the present study, the highest
prevalence of anemia was found among older subjects from
NHANES III who were in the lowest quartile of serum
selenium, which was o1.33 mmol lÀ1 and would be consid-
ered in the suboptimal range. It has been previously reported
that 13.8% of NHANES III participants were taking supple-
ments that contained selenium, but that serum selenium
values were not significantly associated with taking a
supplement that contained selenium (Niskar et al., 2003).
Except for overt clinical selenium deficiency, the health
consequences of an inadequate selenium intake are incom-
pletely understood, and further work is needed to define
optimal selenium status in the elderly population.
In conclusion, low serum selenium was independently
associated with anemia among older men and women living
in the community. This study raises a potentially important
public health question: has selenium deficiency been over-
looked as a cause of anemia among older adults? This study
may represent a first important step toward determining
whether selenium deficiency is a potential cause of anemia
among older adults. To our knowledge, it is not known
whether improving dietary selenium intake will increase
hemoglobin concentrations among older adults with
low serum selenium concentrations. Further work is needed
to corroborate these findings in other populations, provide
evidence for longitudinal causal associations, identify
underlying biological mechanisms and determine whether
improving selenium status has an impact upon anemia in
older adults.
This study was sponsored by National Institute on Aging,
National Institutes of Health (R01 AG027012, R01 AG029148
and Intramural Research Branch).
