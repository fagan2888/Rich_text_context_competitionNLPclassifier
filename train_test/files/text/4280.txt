Introduction
Pancreatitis is the most common disorder of the exocrine
pancreas in cats and is clinically important in this spe-
cies.1,2 Despite that fact, the pathophysiology is poorly
understood and its aetiology remains unknown in the
majority of cases.3 Furthermore, clinical signs are often
non-specific hence its diagnosis remains challenging.2,4
Strictly speaking, pancreatitis refers to inflammation
(ie, infiltration with inflammatory cells) of the exocrine
pancreas. However, the term pancreatitis is commonly
expanded to also include diseases of the exocrine pan-
creas characterised mainly by necrosis (necrotising

Abstract
Objectives Pancreatitis is a frequent disease in cats for which the ante-mortem diagnosis remains challenging.
Feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPLI) has been reported to have a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of
pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to compare the rapid in-house test SNAP fPL with the standard test Spec fPL
and to evaluate the use of SNAP fPL to diagnose pancreatitis in an emergency setting.
Methods fPLI of 111 cats with a clinical suspicion of pancreatitis was measured with both SNAP fPL and Spec fPL.
Furthermore, clinical signs, haematological and biochemical changes, and abdominal ultrasound findings were
recorded.
Results Seventy-eight of 111 cats (70.3%) were tested below the cut-off level for pancreatitis with SNAP, as well
as Spec fPL, whereas 21/111 (18.9%) were tested with values above the cut-off level with both tests. In 12/111
(10.8%) cats the results were discordant. The comparison of both tests revealed an agreement of 78/80 (97.5%)
when Spec fPL was 3.5 g/l (negative) and 18/20 (90%) when Spec fPL was 5.4 g/l (positive). The most
common clinical signs in cats with suspected pancreatitis (n = 21) were lethargy (95.2%), reduced appetite and
vomiting (90.5% each), dehydration (81.0%), diarrhoea (57.1%), abdominal pain and weight loss (47.6% each).
Hyperglycaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia (85.7% each), increased aspartate transaminase (76.2%) and alanine
transaminase (47.6%), leucocytosis (61.9%), lymphopenia (57.1%), decreased sodium and chloride (57.1% each),
and increased urea (52.4%) were the most common abnormalities in blood work.
Conclusions and relevanceClinical signs, as well as routine blood-work changes, were non-specific and thus
proved to be insufficient to diagnose pancreatitis. The combination of SNAP fPL and subsequent Spec fPL, if
indicated, provided the opportunity to rule out or to diagnose pancreatitis with a higher certainty than previously
known test methods. This study proved SNAP fPL to be a valuable tool to exclude or include pancreatitis in an
emergency setting.

pancreatitis) or irreversible structural changes such as
fibrosis (chronic pancreatitis [CP]), sometimes with only
minimal inflammatory component.4 CP lesions in cats
resemble CP in people, with fibrosis being more promi-
nent than inflammatory changes.1 Cystic degeneration
gradually increases as other lesions of CP become more
prominent. Histologically, acute pancreatitis (AP) con-
sists of neutrophilic inflammation associated with inter-
stitial oedema and necrosis of mesenteric fat. In the cat,
there is often some overlap between the acute and
chronic forms of feline pancreatitis.1,2 In 115 cats pre-
sented for necropsy, irrespective of the cause of death,1
an overall prevalence of 67% of pancreatic changes was
identified (45% in clinically normal animals). CP was
found in 60% of the pancreases (50% CP only), with a
significant correlation between age and occurrence of
CP. AP was present in 16% (6% AP only).
Diagnosing feline pancreatitis ante-mortem remains
a challenge for the clinician.2,4 This difficulty has multi-
ple origins, which include the undefined aetiology,
often mild and non-specific clinical signs,1,5 poor sensi-
tivity and specificity of most of the imaging or clinico-
pathological findings,6,7 frequent concomitant disorders
and difficulty in obtaining or interpreting biopsy sam-
ples.2 In addition, sensitive and specific tests for the
diagnosis of feline pancreatitis were, until recently, not
available. Serum amylase and serum lipase activities
have been evaluated in both experimental and sponta-
neous feline pancreatitis showing non-specific increases
associated with liver,8,9 renal or other gastrointestinal
diseases. Results of clinical studies suggest that these
two traditional tests, which are not specific for pancreas,
are of no clinical value in cats and should not be used
for the diagnosis of feline pancreatitis.3,6 However, mod-
erate-to-good sensitivity and specificity of lipase has
been reported for the diagnosis of feline pancreatitis
using the 1,2-o-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid-(6'-
methylresorufin) ester (or DGGR-lipase) assay.10
Feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPLI) is a
species-specific immunoassay that became available
some years ago.11 In contrast to the traditional catalytic
assays for serum lipase activity, which indiscriminately
measure the activity of lipases of any origin (eg, pancre-
atic, gastric, duodenal), fPLI specifically measures pan-
creatic lipase and thus it is specific for pancreatic disease.
Studies in cats with spontaneous and experimental pan-
creatitis have shown that fPLI is very sensitive for mod-
erate to severe pancreatitis,12,13 being superior to the
sensitivities of feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity
(fTLI) and abdominal ultrasound. IDEXX provides two
different tests to measure fPLI. Spec fPL is a quantitative
test performed in reference laboratories. Based on the
same concept, SNAP fPL is a semi-quantitative rapid in-
house test available for practitioners and reveals a `nor-
mal' (3.5 g/l) or `abnormal' (>3.5 µg/l) test result.
The aim of this study was to compare the rapid in-
house test SNAP fPL with the standard test Spec fPL and
to evaluate the use of the SNAP fPL to diagnose pancrea-
titis in an emergency setting.
Materials and methods
Animals
All cats with a clinical suspicion of pancreatitis admitted to
theVeterinary Teaching HospitaloftheUniversity ofLeipzig
between June 2011 and March 2012 entered the study. The
prospective study protocol included signalment (sex, breed
and age) as well as body weight at time of presentation, his-
tory and physical examination, blood work, abdominal
ultrasound, SNAP fPL and Spec fPL, and follow-up.
History and physical examination
Investigated clinical signs included diarrhoea, vomiting,
reduced appetite, lethargy, abdominal pain, dehydra-
tion, jaundice, fever or hypothermia and weight loss.
Furthermore, historic or present co-occurring diseases
were evaluated.
Blood work
Blood samples were taken for all patients mostly at pres-
entation, but always within 24 h. We would like to note
that data presentation and discussion is limited to cats
with diagnosed pancreatitis. A complete blood count
(CBC) with differential was performed. The analysis
included haematocrit, number of leukocytes, neutro-
philic granulocytes (with potential left shift), eosino-
philic granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and
thrombocytes. The measurements were performed on
the following machines: ProCyte (IDEXX Vet Med
Labor), pocH-100 iv Diff (Sysmex) or Vet abc (Scil), and
were manually checked in most cases.
The chemistry profile included the following param-
eters: total protein and albumin, glucose, urea, creati-
nine, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase (ALT),
aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin and electro-
lytes (Na, K, Ca, P). These measurements were per-
formed on a Fuji Dri Chem 3500i (Scil).
SNAP fPL and Spec fPL
The serum concentration of fPLI of all cats was measured
with SNAP fPL in-house and with Spec fPL at IDEXX.
Both values were measured within 24 h of presentation
and within the same blood sample. The semi-quantitative
SNAP fPL can only distinguish between normal and
abnormal results, whereas Spec fPL differentiates
between negative (3.5 g/l), increased (3.6­5.3 g/l)
and positive (5.4 g/l) values.
Abdominal ultrasound
Abdominal ultrasound was performed within 24 h on a
Logiq E9 (GE Healthcare) if possible. In some cases
(emergency situation, no specialist in house, etc)
Schnauß et al 3
ultrasound was performed at a later stage; however,
these results (>24 h after presentation) were not consid-
ered owing to the possible influence of symptomatic
therapy. The following parameters were considered
indicative for pancreatitis: enlargement of the pancreas,
peripancreatic fluid accumulation, heterogenicity with
increased (fibrosis) or decreased (necrosis) echogenicity
and increased echogenicity in the surrounding mesen-
tery (adiponecrosis).
Retrospective classification
Depending on their history, physical examination, clini-
cal signs, blood work, abdominal ultrasound and follow-
up, the cats were retrospectively assigned to four different
groups with regard to the probability of having pancrea-
titis, as described previously.14 Group I included cats
with negative SNAP and Spec fPL results and no evi-
dence for pancreatitis otherwise (eg, in abdominal ultra-
sound). Group II included cats with clinical signs similar
to pancreatitis, but suspicion was not confirmed by SNAP
and/or Spec fPL, abdominal ultrasound and/or follow-
up. Group III included cats with clinical signs fitting to
pancreatitis and confirmed by SNAP fPL and/or Spec
fPL, abdominal ultrasound and/or follow-up (minimum
three points indicating pancreatitis). Group IV included
cats with conflicting results, where diagnosis was unclear
(eg, pancreatitis possible owing to clinical signs and/or
ultrasound, but SNAP and Spec fPL negative).
Statistical analysis
Agreement of SNAP fPL and Spec fPL was calculated
with Cohen's kappa ().
Results
Animals
A total of 111 cats with an initial suspicion of pancreatitis
were entered in the study. Most cats were domestic short-
hairs (n = 92; 82.9%). Furthermore, six Persians, four cross-
breeds, three Maine Coons, two Birmans and one each of
Chartreux, British Shorthair, Thai and Siberian Forest Cat
completed the study population. Male cats were over-
represented[72(64.9%;54castrated,18intact)],whereasonly
39 females (35.1% [26 castrated, 13 intact]) were included.
Age ranged from 4 months to 17.6 years (median 7.25 years).
SNAP fPL and Spec fPL
Seventy-eight of 111 cats (70.3%) were tested as normal
with SNAP fPL, as well as Spec fPL, whereas 21/111
(18.9%) were tested as elevated with both tests. In 12/111
(10.8%) of the cats, results of the two tests were discordant
(Figure 1). The comparison of both tests revealed an agree-
ment of 78/80 (97.5%) when Spec fPL was 3.5 g/l (neg-
ative) and 18/20 (90%) when Spec fPL was 5.4 g/l
(positive) (Table 1). In the cases where the Spec fPL level
was 3.6­5.3 g/l, only 3/11 (27.3%) had an abnormal
SNAP fPL result, whereas 8/11 (72.7%) were tested nor-
mal. Evaluating both abnormal Spec fPLintervals together
(3.6 g/l), only 21/31 (67.7%) showed an abnormal
SNAP fPL. The calculation of Cohen's  revealed a high
accordance of the two tests with a value of 0.6524.
Retrospective classification: group I
Twelve cats (10.8%) were negative with SNAPas well as Spec
fPL, and displayed generally no evidence for pancreatitis
(group I). In two of these cases abdominal ultrasound was

performed. Owing to their low probability of pancreatitis,
cats in this group were not investigated further.
Retrospective classification: group II
Seventy-four cats (66.7%) were assigned to group II, with
clinical signs similar to pancreatitis, but suspicion was
not confirmed by SNAP and Spec fPL, abdominal ultra-
sound (12 cats) or follow-up (Figure 2). Most cats in this
group were domestic shorthairs (n = 62 [83.8%]).
Furthermore, four Persians, three crossbreeds and one
each of Maine Coon, Birman, Chartreux, British Shorthair
and Thai completed this group. Forty-five (60.8%) were
male (36 castrated, nine intact) and 29 were female (39.2%;
19 spayed and 10 intact). The median age in this group
was 7.7 years (range 4 months to 15 years) with a median
body weight of 5.0 kg (range 1.9­11.2 kg). For 62/74
(83.8%) cats, SNAP fPL and Spec fPL yielded normal
results (Figure 2). The remaining 12/74 (16.2%) cats had
discordant results with normal SNAP fPL but elevated
Spec fPL between 3.6 and 5.3 µg/l, making up for most of
these discordant results (n = 8/12).
Retrospective classification: group III
According to their history, physical examination, clinical
signs, blood work, abdominal ultrasound (13 cats) and
follow-up, 21 cats (18.9%) were retrospectively assigned
to group III with a very high probability of having pan-
creatitis (Figure 2). Besides two Maine Coons and one
Persian, all cats in this group were domestic shorthairs (n
= 18 [85.7%]). Seventeen (81.0%) were male (13 castrated,
four intact) and four were female (19.0%; three spayed
and one intact). The median age in this group was 9.4
years (range 2 months to 17.6 years) with a median body
weight of 4.9 kg (range 2.5­8.4 kg). For 20/21 (95.2%)
cats, SNAP fPL and Spec fPL yielded abnormal results
3.6 g/l (Figure 2). Only one cat yielded a normal
SNAP fPL but an elevated Spec fPL 5.4 g/l.
Clinical signs in group III
Typical clinical signs in the cats with a high suspicion of
having pancreatitis (group III; out of history and physi-
cal examination) were lethargy (95.2%), reduced appe-
tite and vomiting (90.5% each) and dehydration (81.0%).
The results are summarised in Table 2.
Blood work in group III
The most important changes found in the CBCs of the
cats in group III were leucocytosis (13/21 [61.9%]) and
lymphopenia (12/21 [57.1%]).
With regard to the chemistry profile, the most promi-
nent abnormalities in the cats of group III were hyper-
glycaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia (18/21 [85.7%
each]), increased AST (16/21 [76.2%]) and ALT (10/21
[47.6%]), hyponatraemia and hypochloraemia (12/21
[57.1% each]), as well as increased urea (11/21 [52.4%]).
The results are summarised in Table 3.

Abdominal ultrasound in group III
In 13 patients an abdominal ultrasound was performed
leading to an ultrasonographic diagnosis of pancreatitis
in seven cats (53.8%). Decreased echogenicity of the pan-
creatic tissue, enlargement of the pancreas and increased
echogenicity of the surrounding mesentery (adiponecro-
sis) were the most prominent findings. In five cats, there
was nothing abnormal detected in ultrasonography and
one pancreas could not be evaluated sufficiently.
Furthermore, additional cholecystitis was found in two
and cholestasis of the cystic duct and choledochus in one
cat. Two cats had ascites.
Retrospective classification: group IV
In four cats (3.6%), pancreatitis could not be excluded
due to clinical signs and ultrasound (four cases), but
SNAP and Spec fPL were negative. Therefore, they were
assigned to group IV with an unclear diagnosis. Owing
to this, they were excluded from the study.
Discussion
Feline pancreatitis is a common disorder with a rather
non-specific clinical, haematological and biochemical
manifestation. Abdominal ultrasound is the preferred
imaging method to diagnose pancreatitis,3,11 although its
sensitivity has been reported to be low in the range of
11­67%.7,11­13
Neither the traditional serum amylase/serum lipase
activity2,6,14­16 nor fTLI13,17,18 are sufficient for the diagno-
sis of feline pancreatitis. SNAP fPL is supposed to enable
general practitioners to diagnose pancreatitis more rap-
idly. In this study, 78/111 cats (70.3%) revealed normal
test results in both tests, whereas 21/111 (18.9%) were
tested abnormal in SNAP fPL as well as Spec fPL. SNAP
fPL and Spec fPL yielded discordant results in only
12/111 (10.8%) cases. Thus, the overall correlation of
both tests was 99/111 (89.2%). SNAP fPL correlated best
with Spec fPL when results were 3.5 g/l (97.5%) or
5.4 g/l (90.0%). These findings correspond approxi-
mately to statements of the IDEXX Vet Med Labor (92%
and 96%, respectively).19 For a Spec fPL between 3.6 and
5.3 g/l 8/11 (72.7%) cats revealed normal results in
SNAP fPL. Where Spec fPL was increased (3.6­5.3 g/l)
and consequently pancreatitis was possible (but not
proven), only 3/11 (27.3%) of SNAP fPL results were
abnormal. Feasible reasons are that SNAP fPL shows a
deficiency when measuring a slight increase or that the
colour change is subjectively misjudged. However, not
every cat with an increased Spec fPL concentration (3.6­
5.3 g/l) had a strong suspicion of pancreatitis. With
regard to the cases with a strong suspicion of pancreatitis
(group III), only one cat (4.8%) had a false-negative
SNAP fPL result (Spec fPL was 6.0 g/l). An abnormal
SNAP fPL result was recorded for 20/21 cats (95.2%)
with pancreatitis. Therefore, although the Spec fPL
results in the range of 3.6­5.3 g/l cannot be used as a
reliable indicator for pancreatitis, SNAP fPL meets the
demand for a reliable and easily performable in-house
test. SNAP fPLI revealed an abnormal test result in 100%
of the cases with a Spec fPL 7.9 g/l. Furthermore, in
this study a single SNAP fPL Test was considered nor-
mal with a Spec fP above the cut-off of 5.4 µg/l (7.4 µg/l).
This highlights the advantage of SNAP fPL in severe
cases with high Spec fPL.
For the four cases with positive abdominal ultra-
sound but double-negative SNAP fPL and Spec fPL
results (group IV), we were unable to determine whether
both fPLI tests were false negative or the ultrasound
false positive without histological analysis. Reasons for
the mismatch of the commercial tests and ultrasono-
graphic statements can be an indisposition of the pan-
creas not involving an increase of fPLI (eg, neoplasia,
hyperplastic nodules, oedema).3,13 Furthermore, a
trauma such as high-rise syndrome can cause ultrasono-
graphic alterations, which persist longer than an increase
of the fPLI level.20 Additionally, other gastrointestinal
diseases can develop ultrasonographic evidence consist-
ent with pancreatitis.3,13 Moreover, ultrasonographic
aberrances can be a consequence of CP (eg, atrophy,
fibrosis) without acute inflammation and release of fPLI
at the time of taking blood samples. These deviations
support the argument that the sensitivity of fPLI is lower
for CP.3 But even if these cats are considered false nega-
tive in SNAP fPL, this study still shows 80.0% (20/25)
sensitivity, which is higher than any other single test pub-
lished to date.
According to the manufacturer, the SNAP fPL is
designed to rule out pancreatitis. In our study, 83/86
cats (96.5%) allocated to groups I and II (no pancreatitis)
were correctly tested as negative. For 9/74 cats (12.2%)
in group II, Spec fPL results between 3.6 and 5.3 g/l
were recorded. According to the manufacturer, a slightly
increased Spec fPL simply indicates that pancreatitis is
possible.21 Another potential explanation is that other
diseases cause clinical signs and a co-occurring mild
pancreatitis leading to a misclassification into group II.
Additionally, cats might have a naturally occurring

inter-individual variability of their normal fPLI concen-
tration above the reference interval. However, there is
still the possibility of false-negative SNAP fPL results.
For the 86 cats within groups I and II (no pancreatitis),
SNAP fPL was only false positive in three cats (3.5%).
Two of these results were negative in Spec fPL
(3.5 g/l), whereas pancreatitis in one of these cats
could not be excluded by Spec fPL.
This cat (Spec fPL: 4.7 g/l; SNAP: abnormal) suffered
from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertension,
which was treated successfully. Subsequently, SNAP fPL
and Spec fPL tests were repeated, later yielding normal
results. The cat with an abnormal Spec fpL (7.4 g/l;
SNAP fPL normal) was euthanased at the owner's
request. It was considered a false positive because nec-
ropsy revealed a normal pancreas but a perforated gut.

If practitioners receive an unexpected SNAP fPL
result, it is recommended that this measurement is con-
firmed with Spec fPL and preferably backed up with
abdominal ultrasound evaluation. This approach is sup-
ported by the data from group II, where three abnormal
SNAP fPL test results were corrected by Spec fPL, as well
as in group III, where the only SNAP-normal cat was
proven to have a pancreatitis with a Spec fPL value 5.4
µg/l. In emergency situations it is recommended that
cats are treated symptomatically with infusion, antiemet-
ics and analgesics, etc, until the diagnosis is clear and the
treatment can be specifically adapted.
The major shortcoming of our study is that the diag-
nosis of pancreatitis was almost exclusively based on
non-invasive methods and expert opinion.15 Histological
biopsies ­ the gold standard to diagnose pancreatitis ­
are needed to evaluate these tests with a higher cer-
tainty, but would require extensive clinical studies and
owners willing to take biopsies in an already diseased
animal. This is, at least in our environment, very diffi-
cult to get.
As known from other studies, it is impossible to diag-
nose feline pancreatitis on the basis of clinical signs, CBC
and blood chemistry without any further investiga-
tions,6,7,10 as they are very unspecific. The percentages of
unspecific lethargy (95.2%) and reduced appetite and
vomiting (90.5% each) are even higher than results from
another study.11 Furthermore, dehydration was seen reg-
ularly (81.0%) compared with other studies (eg, 92% and
39%11).6,11 Diarrhoea (57.1%) was less common than other
clinical signs, which has been shown in previous stud-
ies.6,10,11 Abdominal pain was detected in 47.6% of the
cats ­ a value that is higher than in older studies but
similar to newer ones.6,10,11 Nevertheless, cats either con-
ceal their pain or pancreatitis is less painful for cats than
for dogs and humans. Additionally, the detection of
abdominal pain is not only subjective, but also variable
owing to different veterinarians on emergency duty see-
ing the cats.
Similar to other surveys, predispositions concerning
breedandbodyweightwerenotperceived.1,6Additionally,
the average age of group III (9.4 years) was slightly higher
than in group II (7.7 years), which is compatible with
older animals that suffer more often from pancreatitis.20 A
higher ratio of males was noticed in the group of cats with
pancreatitis (81%); however, the proportion of males was
higher in the whole study population (64.7%).
The most common haematological changes associated
with pancreatitis were leucocytosis (61.9%) and lymphope-
nia (57.1%). An increased incidence of hyperglycaemia and
hyperbilirubinaemia (85.7% each) and an increase in hepatic
enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) were conspicu-
ous, as in previous studies.6,11 Only 19% of the cats had an
increased creatinine; therefore, it is unlikely that kidney dis-
ease had an influence on serum lipase level. Electrolyte
imbalances (hyponatraemia and hypochloraemia, 57.1%
each) were most likely induced by vomiting and anorexia.
However, various instruments with various reference inter-
vals were applied owing to cases coming in as emergencies
or during day shifts. However, these parameters proved to
be rather unspecific to diagnose pancreatitis.
Conclusions
As there is no ante-mortem gold standard to diagnose
feline pancreatitis, a combination of history, clinical
signs, measurement of pancreatic lipase immunoreactiv-
ity and ultrasonography is the most reliable non-invasive
procedure to diagnose feline pancreatitis. Clinical signs,
as well as routine blood-work changes, were non-spe-
cific and thus proved to be insufficient to diagnose pan-
creatitis. SNAP fPL and Spec fPL have a good agreement,
especially when Spec fPL is 3.5 or 5.4 g/l. The com-
bination of SNAP fPL and subsequent Spec fPL, if indi-
cated, provided the opportunity to rule out or to diagnose
pancreatitis with a higher certainty than previously
known test methods. This study proved SNAP fPL to be
a reliable tool to exclude or include pancreatitis in an
emergency setting in-house.
