Abstract
Our objective in this study was to estimate calcium intakes from food, water, dietary supplements, and antacids for U.S.
citizens aged $1 y using NHANES 2003­2006 data and the Dietary Reference Intake panel age groupings. Similar
estimates were calculated for vitamin D intake from food and dietary supplements using NHANES 2005­2006. Diet was
assessed with 2 24-h recalls; dietary supplement and antacid use were determined by questionnaire. The National Cancer
Institute method was used to estimate usual nutrient intake from dietary sources. The mean daily nutrient intake from
supplemental sources was added to the adjusted dietary intake estimates to produce total usual nutrient intakes for
calcium and vitamin D. A total of 53% of the U.S. population reported using any dietary supplement (2003­2006), 43%
used calcium (2003­2006), and 37% used vitamin D (2005­2006). For users, dietary supplements provided the adequate
intake (AI) recommendation for calcium intake for ~12% of those $71 y. Males and females aged 1­3 y had the highest
prevalence of meeting the AI from dietary and total calcium intakes. For total vitamin D intake, males and females $71,
and females 14­18 y had the lowest prevalence of meeting the AI. Dietary supplement use is associated with higher
prevalence of groups meeting the AI for calcium and vitamin D. Monitoring usual total nutrient intake is necessary to
adequately characterize and evaluate the population's nutritional status and adherence to recommendations for nutrient
intake. J. Nutr. 140: 817­822, 2010.
Introduction
Calcium is one of the major mineral components of the skeletal
system and is also an essential nutrient required for nerve
conduction, muscle contraction, hormone and enzyme secretion,
and blood clotting. Adequate calcium intake is essential for
normal growth and development of the skeleton and teeth and
for adequate bone mineralization. Optimizing bone mass
accretion in youth and adolescence is critical to attaining peak
bone mass in adulthood (1). In adulthood, low calcium intake
has been associated with increased risk for osteoporosis (2),
bone fractures, and falls (3,4). Monitoring of calcium intake is
necessary to evaluate one of the goals for Healthy People 2010,
which is to increase the proportion of people aged $2 y who
meet the dietary recommendations for calcium (5). Only 32% of
U.S. adults met the adequate intake (AI)8 for calcium through
diet in 1999­2004 (6); however, that report did not include all
sources of intake, which is necessary for the accurate and precise
estimation of total usual calcium intake. Data from the
NHANES provide information on intakes of calcium from all
sources, the diet, water, dietary supplement use, and antacid
consumption, and permits estimation of total calcium intake.
Vitamin D works to aid calcium absorption and its role in
bone health has been well characterized (7). An accumulating
body of evidence suggests that it may have other roles in human
health and that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to certain
chronic diseases (8). Vitamin D occurs naturally in only a few
foods and is also available in fortified foods (milk and milk
products, margarines, some juices, and breakfast cereals).
Fortified foods constitute the major food sources of vitamin D
in the United States (9). Data on dietary intakes of vitamin D
were not available in the continuous NHANES (1999­2004)
because of incomplete values for the nutrient in survey food
composition tables. Recently, the NHANES 2005­2006 vitamin D

intake data from the diet were released (10). Estimates of usual
vitamin D and calcium intake are necessary for setting the
Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) intake levels (11). We analyzed
recent NHANES survey data to provide national estimates of
total usual intake of calcium and vitamin D from all sources by
gender and age groups and compared them to the appropriate
DRI recommendations.
Materials and Methods
The NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey that
samples noninstitutionalized, civilian U.S. residents using a complex,
stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling design (12). The
NHANES data are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics
of the CDC. Written informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants or proxies and the survey protocol was approved by the Research
Ethics Review Board at the National Center for Health Statistics.
NHANES participants are asked to complete an in-person household
interview and a health examination in a mobile examination center that
includes an in-person 24-h dietary recall. A second 24-h dietary recall is
collected via telephone ~3­10 d after the mobile examination center
exam. Both 24-h recalls were collected using USDA's Automated
Multiple-Pass method (13,14). For both 24-h recalls, proxy respondents
report for children who are 5 y and younger and proxy-assisted
interviews are conducted with children 6­11 y of age (15). Dietary
supplement use information was collected during the household inter-
view as part of the Dietary Supplement Questionnaire. Information
included the participant's use of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other
dietary supplements over the past 30 d. Detailed information about type,
consumption frequency, duration, and amount taken was also collected
for each reported dietary supplement. The average daily intake of
nutrients from dietary supplements was calculated for individuals using
the number of days supplement use was reported, the reported amount
taken per day, and the serving size unit from the product label. Calcium
from antacids was collected as part of the NHANES nonprescription
drug questionnaire that participants self-completed at the home inter-
view. For this analysis, calcium was standardized to the elemental form
in milligrams and vitamin D was standardized to the microgram metric
for comparison to the DRI recommendations.
The unweighted examination response rate for all participants,
calculated as the number of participants per component divided by the
total number selected into the sample, was 79% for the interview
component and 76% for the exam component in NHANES 2003­2004
and 80% for the interview component and 77% for the exam component
in NHANES 2005­2006. Survey years 2003­2004 (n = 10,122) were
combined with 2005­2006 (n = 10,348) for the calcium analysis. The
vitamin D analysis is only for 2005­2006, because dietary data are only
available for this NHANES wave at this time. Exclusions were made in
the following sequence: individuals under the age of 1 y (n = 477 in
2003­4, n = 526 in 2005­6) or who were pregnant (n = 477 in 2003­4,
n = 526 in 2005­6) or lactating (n = 44 in 2003­4, n = 46 in 2005­6) and
those who did not complete or who had incomplete dietary recall data
(n = 1050 in 2003­4, n = 957 in 2005­6).
Usual total nutrient intake. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)
method (16) was used to produce usual nutrient intake estimates
utilizing the amount-only part of the NCI method. The first step in the
NCI method for nutrients (assumed to be consumed every day by every
member of the population) replaces reported zero intakes with one-half
of the minimum nonzero value reported in the data set (this was
necessary for ,1% of the data and only for the vitamin D analyses). The
second step in the NCI method models Box-Cox­transformed 24-h recall
observations as a function of observed fixed-effect covariates, unob-
served individual-level random effects, and within-individual error. For
these analyses, the covariates were: 1) sequence of the 24-h recall; 2) day
of the week the 24-h recall was collected, dichotomized as weekend
(Friday­Sunday) or weekday (Monday­Thursday); and 3) dietary
supplement use. The amount of calcium provided from dietary supple-
ments and antacids (0­100, 101­400, .400 mg/d) and the amount of
vitamin D from dietary supplements (0­2.5, 2.5­5, 5­10, and .10 mg/d)
was used in the model. The first 2 covariates (sequence and weekend) are
examples of "nuisance effects" that are explicitly adjusted for in the
estimation of usual intake, as described below. The Box-Cox transfor-
mation is chosen such that the differences ("residuals") between
transformed observations and their predictions based on the fixed-effect
parameter estimates are separable into normally distributed random
effects (representing between-individual differences not explained by
covariates) and normally distributed within-person errors. Within- and
between-individual variance components of the residuals are estimated
in the transformed scale.
The estimated distribution of usual dietary intake is constructed to
reflect only between-person variability; the within-person variability is
eliminated because it does not reflect usual intake. For the model under
consideration, between-person variation in usual intake arises from
differences in measured covariate values across individuals and from the
random effects. Within-individual variation is also partly due to
measured covariate values (interview sequence and weekend effects).
The first step in constructing the usual dietary intake distribution is to
obtain a set of representative values whose empirical distribution
approximates the assumed distribution of between-individual random
effects. The NCI method as described in Tooze et al. (16) uses a Monte
Carlo simulation method to obtain a large set (by default, 100/
individual) of such values assuming the random effects are exactly
normally distributed. An alternative approach that is more robust to the
normality assumption at the expense of some efficiency applies the
procedure of Dodd et al. (17) to the individual's mean residual to
construct a smaller set (one per individual) of representative values
"shrunk" to the group mean of the residuals. Using either method, the
empirical distribution of these initial representative values reflects
between-individual variation that is not explained by covariates. Next,
the covariate information in the data set is used to calculate 2 fixed effect
predictions for each individual. The first of the 2 predictions is computed
as if it were a first interview on a weekend day, the second is computed as
it if were the first interview on a weekday. Other values of the covariates
are held at their observed values for the individual. Corresponding
representative value from the first step are added to each individual's 2
predictions and the resulting quantities are each back-transformed to the
original scale using the procedure described by Dodd et al. (17). Next,
the 2 original-scale predictions are combined in a weighted average
giving weight 3/7 to the weekend prediction and 4/7 to the weekday
prediction. The empirical distribution function of the resulting quanti-
ties, weighted according to the survey sampling weights, is an estimate of
the usual dietary intake distribution. Finally, each individual's reported
daily intake of the nutrient from supplement sources is added to his or
her corresponding value(s) computed from the previous step, and the
empirical distribution of these final sums, weighted according to the
survey sampling weights, is an estimate of the usual total intake
distribution.
This construction of the distribution estimator accounts for both
kinds of between-individual variation mentioned above and explicitly
adjusts for the nuisance effects of interview sequence and weekend/
weekday differences. Choosing to compute fixed effect predictions as if
for a first recall implicitly assumes that the first recall for an individual is
the most accurate. The weighted averaging of back-transformed week-
end and weekday predictions assumes that the desired usual intake in the
original scale is an average over many weeks, where weekends and
weekdays occur with frequencies 3 and 4 of 7, respectively. Finally, using
categorized supplement intake as a covariate allows groups of individ-
uals with different levels of supplemental intake to have a different mean
usual intake from food sources.
Complete details of the NCI method and the SAS macros necessary to
fit this model and to perform the Monte Carlo-based estimation of usual
intake distributions can be found at the NCI Web site (18). Custom SAS
macros were created to estimate usual dietary and total intake
distributions using the shrinkage technique and to perform Fay's
(19,20) Modified Balanced Repeated Replication variance calculations.
The shrinkage technique produced estimates of usual dietary intake that
were practically identical to the ones produced by the Monte Carlo
technique. In the results that follow, distributions of dietary intake are

based on the Monte Carlo technique supported by the official NCI
macros. However, distributions of total nutrient intake are based on the
shrinkage technique. Because the shrinkage technique operates on
person-specific residuals, it was thought to be more robust in case the
relationship between individual dietary intake and individual supple-
ment intake was not adequately modeled simply by inclusion of the
supplement-use covariates.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS
(version 9, SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 9,
Research Triangle Institute) software. Sample weights were used to
account for differential nonresponse and noncoverage and to adjust for
planned oversampling of some groups. For statistical procedures not
specifically designed to analyze survey data, the sample weights were
treated as counts of individuals with identical data. SE for all statistics of
interest were approximated by the Balanced Repeated Replication
technique (19,20) using 32 sets of replicate weights (for 2003­2006) and
16 sets of replicate weights (for 2005­2006) constructed with an initial
perturbation factor of 0.7. Each set of replicate weights was poststratified
to control totals computed from the initial sample weights.
The prevalence of use and mean contribution of calcium and vitamin
D from supplemental sources was calculated. Mean calcium and vitamin
D intake were calculated from the estimated usual intake distributions
(dietary and total). Each adjusted intake was compared with the AI and
tolerable upper intake level (UL) (21) appropriate to the individual, and
the fraction of individuals above the cutoffs was used as the estimate of
the proportion of the population that is meeting the DRI recommenda-
tions. We tabulated statistics for 16 DRI age and gender groups. Each
gender/age group was analyzed independently of the others.
Rather than making all possible pairwise comparisons, we used Hsu's
(22) procedure to determine (within gender) which age groups had the
highest and lowest population value(s) for: 1) calcium/vitamin D dietary
supplement use prevalence; 2) mean calcium/vitamin D intake from
dietary supplements; 3) proportions meeting DRI recommendations for
calcium/vitamin D from dietary sources only; and 4) proportions meet-
ing DRI recommendations calcium/vitamin D from all sources. The
procedure also allows construction of simultaneous CI for differences
between each age group's population value and that of the largest/
smallest population value. This procedure controls the experiment-wise
Type I error rate in a manner more appropriate for this purpose than the
classic Bonferroni approach. Hsu's (22) procedure, with an a of 0.025,
was performed twice per gender for each of the 4 types of outcomes; once
to find the largest and once to find the smallest population values(s).
Thus, the experiment-wise error rate is held at an a # 0.05, where an
"experiment" refers to pinpointing age groups with the highest and age
groups with the lowest population values for a given outcome/gender
combination.
Results
Dietary supplement use. Over one-half (53.4%) of NHANES
2003­2006 participants reported use of any dietary supplement
over the last 30 d and 43% of the U.S. population over the age of
1 y used supplemental calcium. Among supplement users, the
overall mean intake of calcium from supplemental sources was
331 mg/d (Table 1); dietary supplements provided the AI level of
calcium for 8 6 1% of the population. Taking calcium
supplements was reported by 62 6 2% among those aged
$71 y when genders were combined. For males, mean calcium
intake from supplemental sources was significantly higher in the
$71-y age group than all others. Similarly, females aged $71 y
had a significantly higher prevalence of use of and a higher mean
calcium intake from supplemental sources than every other age
group with the exception of those 51­70 y. Among users of
dietary supplements, ~17% of females $71 y met the AI simply
through their use of dietary supplements.
In 2005­2006, 37% of the U.S. population used a dietary
supplement containing vitamin D (Table 2); fewer males (33 6
1%) then females (40 6 1%) reported use. Males 14­18 y and
females 19­30 y had the lowest prevalence of use of vitamin D
dietary supplements, whereas individuals $71 y had the highest
reported use regardless of gender. For bother genders, those $51
y had the highest mean intakes of vitamin D provided by
supplemental sources.

Dietary and total nutrient intakes. Males and females aged
1­3 y had the highest proportion meeting the AI for dietary and
total intake of calcium across all age groups (Table 3). The
prevalence of intake above the UL was higher for total calcium
intake compared with calcium intake from diet only, but the
prevalence of excessive intake (i.e. above the UL) was still very
small (,2%) except among males aged 14­18 y (4% SE 6 1),
females 51­70 y (4% SE 6 1), and females $71 y (4% SE 6 1)
(data not shown). However, very high calcium total intakes were
observed in the 99th percentile for both males and females of all
ages (Supplemental Table 1).
For males, the highest prevalence of meeting the vitamin D AI
from dietary sources alone was among 1- to 3-y and 4- to 8-y
olds. Among females, age groups 1­3, 4­8, and 9­13 y had the
highest prevalence of meeting the AI from the diet (Table 4). Less
than 7% of males and females over the age of 51 y met the AI for
vitamin D through the diet. When dietary supplement use was
included, the prevalence of those meeting the AI was higher for
all age groups, but most dramatically for those aged 51 y and
older. For total vitamin D intake, males and females $71 y and
females 14­18 y had the lowest prevalence of meeting the AI. As
a group, ,1% exceeded the UL through diet or when total
vitamin D intake was examined (data not shown).
Discussion
This report is the first, to our knowledge, to present national
estimates of usual calcium and vitamin D intake from all sources
for the U.S. population using the most recently available data
from NHANES. More than one-half of the U.S. population uses
dietary supplements; our data indicate some individuals meet the
AI from dietary supplement use alone. Thus, nutrient intakes
from dietary supplements must be included to accurately
characterize total exposure to nutrients and to estimate the
distribution of total usual nutrient intake. Without the inclusion
of supplemental nutrients, mean nutrient intakes are under-
estimated, the prevalence of inadequate intakes is overestimated,
and the prevalence of excessive intakes is underestimated (23).
In public health nutrition research, the distribution of usual
total nutrient intake is a necessary cornerstone (24). The
estimates and the distributions presented in this paper were
adjusted to reflect usual nutrient intake using the NCI method.
The NCI model we employed for the dietary intakes removes the
effect of within-person variability and adjusts for the effects of
known covariates: sequence of 24-h dietary recall, day of the
week that the data were collected, and the amount of the
nutrient provided from supplemental sources. The amount of
the nutrients supplied from supplemental sources is an impor-
tant covariate; previous reports suggest that dietary supplement
users tend to have high dietary intakes of nutrients (23,25).
Thus, the relationship between nutrient intakes from food and
from dietary supplements are complex and should be addressed
(26). The model we developed addressed this covariate statis-
tically by allowing those who used dietary supplements to have a
different group mean nutrient intake from the diet compared
with those who did not use supplements; this allowed for a more
accurate estimation of total usual nutrient intakes. Another
strength of this study is that it provides independently estimated
tabulations of usual intake means, percentiles, and proportions
meeting recommendations for all of the DRI gender/age groups.
Therefore, researchers and policy makers can make pairwise
comparisons between as many DRI age groups as they desire,
although care should be taken to control the Type I error rate
when making many such comparisons. We chose to use Hsu's
(22) procedure to statistically assess selected a priori hypotheses
but recognize that additional comparisons might be of interest.
Some limitations should also be addressed. First, all estimates of
dietary intake assume that reported nutrient intake from food
sources on the 24-h recalls are unbiased and that the self-
reported dietary supplement intake reflects true long-term

supplement intake. Second, estimates of nutrients from dietary
supplements depend largely on label declarations rather than
analytical values. Recent analytical data on dietary supplements
suggest that actual levels exceed the labeled values for many
vitamins and minerals (27,28). For calcium, the average devi-
ation from the label is 14% (29); information on vitamin D
deviation from label is not known at this time. Thus, the data
presented in this manuscript should be interpreted with these
caveats.
Our results indicate that some age and gender groups have
low calcium intake. Whereas very few infants and toddlers had
low calcium intake, only 15% of 9- to 13-y-old females and
#10% of females aged 14­18, 51­70, and $71 y met the AI for
calcium from diet alone. However, when total intake was
examined, dietary supplements increased the prevalence of
meeting the AI in the older age groups. Nevertheless, considering
dietary supplement use, only 15% of 9- to 13-y-old and 13% of
14- to 18-y-old females met the AI for calcium.
Previous NHANES (1999­2004) estimates of the proportion
of population subgroups above the AI of calcium intake from
food sources are similar to those presented in this updated report
(2003­2006) (6). Our data do, however, suggest a decrease in
the prevalence of meeting the AI for 4- to 8-y-old females. One
potential explanation for this discrepancy could be the methods
used to adjust the data; the Iowa State method (30) was used for
the 1999­2004 estimates. However, recent simulation studies
with calcium indicate that the statistical methods employed to
adjust the dietary intakes of calcium using NHANES data do not
produce very different prevalence estimates or mean calcium
intakes (31). The survey years 1999­2002 have only one 24-h
dietary recall, which may influence the usual intake estimates as
well. Nevertheless, these findings may indicate a decline in
calcium intakes among females 4­8 y of age. The USDA Food
Availability Report indicates an increase in the availability of
dairy products over this time period (32). Interestingly, an
increase in the prevalence of meeting the AI was observed for
both 31- to 50-y-old males and females compared with the
earlier report.
Gahche et al. (33) found that use of vitamin D supplements
has increased over time for U.S. adults (ages 14 y and older) with
26% reporting use in NHANES III, 35% reporting use in
NHANES 1999­2002, and 37% in 2003­2006. Our 2005­
2006 data on vitamin D supplement use in children were almost
identical to an earlier report by Picciano et al. (34) from 1999­
2002 indicating that the prevalence of use among U.S. children
was 33% in children aged 1­3 y, 36% in children 4- to 8-y olds,
23% in those aged 9­13 y, and 16% in 14- to 18-y olds when
genders were combined. Our later data are consistent: 32% use
in children aged 1­3 y, 37% in those aged 4­8 y, 23% in those
aged 9­13 y, and 17% in those aged 14­18 y. Thus, although use
of vitamin D supplements has increased over time in adult
populations (33), the use in children and adolescents appears to
be stable. Whereas younger Americans tend to have the most
favorable total vitamin D intake, a large percentage of older
adults in NHANES fail to meet the recommendations from
diet alone and only improve marginally with the use of dietary
supplements. This may be in part due to the higher AI level in
these age groups: 51­70 y (10 mg/d) and $71 y (15 mg/d).
Regardless, this is of concern given the role of vitamin D in bone
health, falls, and fracture risk in these age groups (35).
Dietary supplements constitute an important source of nutri-
ents for large segments of the population. About 43% of the U.S.
population and almost 70% of older females report supplemental
calcium use. Our data and that of others (36) indicate that dietary
supplement use is associated with a higher prevalence of meeting
the AI for calcium. Recent media attention on the role of vitamin
D in various chronic disease states has dramatically increased sales
of this dietary supplement (37). The distributions of usual total
