DESIGN
Randomized trials of alcohol-use interventions
with college students and their parents: lessons
from the Transitions Project
AC Fernandez, MD Wood, R Laforge and JT Black
Background Matriculation from high school to college is typified by an increase in
alcohol use and related harm for many students. Therefore, this transition period is
an ideal time for preventive interventions to target alcohol use and related
problems.
Purpose The purpose of this report is to describe the design and methods used in
the Transitions Project, a randomized controlled trial of two interventions designed
to prevent and reduce heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related negative
consequences among incoming college students.
Methods This study used a 2 Â 2 factorial design to investigate the effects of a
two-session brief motivational intervention delivered to students and a handbook-
based parent intervention. Interventions were administered to students and
parents. Follow-up assessment took place at 10- and 22-months post-baseline.
Results The Transitions Project successfully recruited and retained participants
across a major transition period (i.e., entering college), administered and compared
two distinct but complementary interventions, and collected and analyzed highly
skewed data. The application of a factorial design and two-part latent growth curve
modeling allowed us to examine main and interactive intervention effects in terms
of both initiation and growth in heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems.
Limitations While we conducted successful tests of our primary and secondary
study hypotheses over a lengthy follow-up period, our study design did not permit
full interpretation of null findings. We suggest that researchers carefully consider
assessment timing, tests of assessment reactivity, and ensure objective tests of
intervention efficacy when conducting clinical trials of motivational interventions.
Conclusions The lessons we learned while conducting this trial have the potential
to assist other researchers designing and conducting future preventive interventions
targeting parents and college students. The data analytic procedures presented can
also help guide trials that plan to analyze zero-inflated non-normal outcome
data. Clinical Trials 2011; 8: 205­213. http://ctj.sagepub.com
Background
The Transitions Project was a randomized
controlled trial designed to examine the unique
and combined effects of two preventive interven-
tions to reduce heavy episodic drinking (HED) and
related-harm among incoming college students.
The purpose of this report is to describe the
methodology of this trial and share the lessons
learned in terms of recruiting and retaining a large
sample across a major transition period (i.e., enter-
ing college), administering and comparing two
complementary interventions, and collecting and
analyzing zero-inflated non-normal data using a
novel data-analytic technique. The reduction of
HED among college students is a national priority
[1,2]. Over 70% of college students report using
alcohol, and approximately 40% report HED

(typically defined as five drinks in a row for men
and four for women) [3]. While alcohol use is
common among late adolescents, the passage from
high school to college is typified by an increase in
alcohol consumption and associated negative
consequences [4­6]. Thus, the transition from
high school to college represents a period of critical
importance with respect to preventing and reduc-
ing heavy drinking and alcohol-related negative
consequences.
Brief motivational interventions are one-on-one
counseling sessions that utilize motivational inter-
viewing and personalized feedback to facilitate
change in health-related behaviors. They are the
most empirically supported individual-level inter-
vention for reducing alcohol use and problems
among heavy drinking college students [7­13].
We expanded on past research by administering
the brief motivational intervention to college
students with heterogeneous drinking experiences
and extending assessment periods beyond 1 year.
Parent-based interventions are an emerging
approach to prevent college student drinking.
These interventions target parents and promote
parenting strategies associated with lower levels of
alcohol use and problems in adolescence; they
build on research indicating that parents exert a
continued influence throughout the college years
[14­17]. However, the potential beneficial role of
parental influence on college student drinking has
not been widely investigated [18­22], despite a
substantial body of research documenting the
efficacy of family and parent-based substance use
interventions for younger adolescents [23­26].
This study
The Transitions Project was designed to simulta-
neously examine a brief motivational and parent-
based intervention as a means to reduce the onset
and growth of college student HED and alcohol-
related consequences. A factorial design was chosen
to examine complementary influences on college
student drinking (parent and peer factors) [27] and
to attempt to increase effect sizes and reduce cost
by combining interventions in one stand-alone
trial [10,28].
Method
The Transitions Project used a 2 Â 2 Â 3 design
with two dichotomous between-subjects factors,
brief motivational intervention (yes, no) and
parent-based intervention (yes, no), and one
within-subjects factor (Time; pre-matriculation,
10 months, 22 months). It was hypothesized that
relative to an assessment only control arm, the
study interventions would reduce the initiation
and growth of HED and consequences among
incoming college students, and the intervention
effect would be multiplicative; (i.e., combined
intervention effects greater than the sum of the
individual effects). Secondary aims of this study
included tests of intervention mediators such as
changes in descriptive norms, for the brief motiva-
tional intervention, and changes in parental
monitoring, for the parent-based intervention.
Recruitment and retention
Eligible students and their parents were recruited
from two successive cohorts of incoming students
at a mid-sized northeastern public university in the
United States. All procedures were approved and
monitored by the university Institutional Review
Board (IRB).
Eligibility criteria
The target population for this research trial was
matriculating first year students ages 17­21 and
their parents. Non-traditional students (e.g., older,
married, returning, and transfer students) were not
eligible to participate because of the emphasis on
parent communication within the home. Biological
parents, stepparents, and legal guardians were
eligible to participate as long as they were living
with the student during the recruitment period.
Recruitment and consent
Recruitment took place by telephone in the
summer prior to college matriculation. Prior to
the first telephone contact, a detailed consent form
and introductory letter were mailed to potential
participants. For students who were under 18 years
of age during the recruitment phase, an assent form
as well as a parental permission letter was sent in
lieu of the standard consent form. Upon telephone
contact, interested parents and students (ages
18 and older) were asked to provide oral consent
and complete the baseline assessment over the
telephone. Students who were 17 years old were
required to provide oral assent and parental
consent over the telephone. In-person consent
was waived because recruitment took place before
the students arrived on campus. IRB approval for
oral consent was obtained in accordance with
206 AC Fernandez et al.

Given the power differential between parent and
child, we chose to recruit students prior to parents
to minimize intentional or unintentional parental
pressure. All participants were informed that their
participation was voluntary, and students were paid
for their baseline participation regardless of parent
recruitment. Confidentiality procedures did not
guarantee complete anonymity for study participa-
tion due to recruitment of family members within
the same household.
In an effort to recruit a gender-balanced parent
sample, a mother or father was randomly chosen as
the initial recruitment target. If the pre-determined
parent was unwilling or unavailable, another
parent was accepted for recruitment (regardless of
gender). We took this approach because fathers
have been under-represented in parent-based
alcohol interventions with college students
[14,27,29,30]. All data were collected through a
professional survey center which utilized compu-
ter-assisted telephone interviewing. Interviewers
were trained, certified, and monitored periodically
in the proper application of standardized inter-
viewing procedures and study protocols [31].
Interviewers were blind to study arms.
Randomization and retention
Student­parent dyads were randomized to treat-
ment arms after consenting and completing the
baseline assessment. Our trial used standard proto-
cols for subject tracking and multiple attempts to
contact participants in each follow-up period
regardless of university enrollment status or partic-
ipation in previous assessments [32]. Home and
local contact information was collected at baseline
and confirmed at all time points. Two supplemen-
tary contacts, i.e., people who would know the
participants' whereabouts at all times, were
collected at each time point.
Incentives
Students received $30 for completing the baseline
interview, $40 for completing the 10-month
follow-up procedures, and $50 after completing
the 22-month follow-up procedures. Participants
who attended all appointments and completed
follow-up procedures on time were eligible for $10
and $20 cash bonuses at the 10- and 22-month
follow-ups, respectively. Three $200 cash prizes
were awarded annually to randomly selected
student participants. Parents were offered $40 at
each time point.
Assessments
Student follow-ups took place at 10 and 22 months
and were anchored according to the baseline
completion date. Assessment time points were
chosen to assess students while they were on
campus and capture long-term (>6 months) inter-
vention effects rarely examined in past research.
The parent follow-up took place at 12 months post-
baseline and was timed to coincide with students
return home for their first summer break in order to
adequately assess parenting behaviors. All student
assessments took place by telephone and lasted
approximately 45­60 min. Parent follow-ups took
place by mail.
Interventions
Brief motivational intervention
The brief motivational intervention used in this
study was modeled after the Brief Alcohol Screening
and Intervention for College Students (BASICS)
program [33] and included two counselor-
facilitated in-person interventions during the fresh-
man year. The initial 1-h meeting took place in the
fall, and the half-hour `booster' session took
place in the spring. Counselors (n ¼ 16) were
bachelor's- and master's-level psychology students
trained in motivational interviewing and interven-
tion content. Training and weekly group
supervision were conducted by a PhD-level
psychologist with years of experience in delivering,
supervising, and researching brief motivation
interventions [11].
A central component of the brief motivational
intervention is the delivery of `personalized
feedback' to students regarding alcohol-related
behavior and beliefs. Feedback forms were created
using assessment data gathered approximately
2 weeks prior to scheduled interventions (once in
the fall and once in the spring). Drinkers received
feedback on their current alcohol use and related-
problems as well as their drinking compared to
`average students.' Abstainers received feedback on
the safety and health benefits of abstinence, their
experiences with second-hand effects of alcohol,
and their abstinence-related self-efficacy. Booster
sessions incorporated feedback on current and past
drinking to reflect change in alcohol-related behav-
ior since the initial evaluation. Clinicians were
trained to present all feedback using an empathic

non-confrontational style and students were given
feedback forms to take home.
To monitor intervention fidelity, the clinical
supervisor randomly selected 5­10% of audio tapes
(50 for the initial fall intervention and 26 for the
spring intervention), and coded them in their
entirety using the Motivational Interviewing
Treatment Integrity scale [34]. Written feedback
was provided to counselors. Session evaluation
forms were also completed by students and coun-
selors after each session to assess the quality and
delivery of intervention components. Evaluation
forms were similar across time points.
Parent-based intervention
The parent-based intervention consisted of a
32-page parent handbook which was mailed to
parents in the summer before students matriculated
to college. The handbook itself was modified from
an original version [30] and included information
designed to raise parental awareness of college
student alcohol use and provide strategies to help
reduce student drinking and associated conse-
quences. These strategies included increasing
parent­teen alcohol-related communication and
parental monitoring, and reducing parental
permissiveness for drinking. A `booster' letter was
mailed a year later that reviewed handbook
concepts and encouraged parents to continue to
implement strategies to reduce college student
alcohol abuse.
In addition to the parent handbook, parents
received a letter explaining the intervention, and a
handbook evaluation form. The letter informed
parents that their evaluations were needed to assess
and improve the handbook [30]. We hoped that
this letter would encourage all parents to read the
materials and provide us with feedback. The eval-
uation form served as our primary measure of
intervention fidelity and assessed readability,
usefulness, and clarity of the handbook. Parents
who did not return the evaluation by mail were
contacted via telephone by the survey research
center.
Outcomes and data analysis
At all time points, students were assessed regarding:
(1) whether and how frequently they engaged in
HED; (2) whether and how often they experienced
alcohol-related negative consequences; and (3)
hypothesized intervention mediators. Because our
study was designed to enroll students with a range
of alcohol-related experiences, our data contained
a large proportion of zero values (i.e., students who
did not drink) in addition to data reflecting very
heavy drinking. To address this skew in our data
distribution, we chose to conduct our analysis
using two-part latent growth curve-modeling. This
technique is well suited to address the heterogene-
ity arising from zero-inflated data by simulta-
neously creating two correlated models from a
single outcome variable; one model for the binary
(onset) portion and one model for continuous (rate
of change) portion of the variable's distribution
[35,36]. In Part 1 (the binary portion), the outcome
variable is modeled as a random-effects logistic
growth model with the log odds of use regressed on
growth factors [37]. In Part 2 (the continuous
portion), the non-zero continuous frequency of
the outcome is modeled using the latent growth
model [38]. For this study, the binary part of the
model estimated growth in onset of HED or
consequences (coded as 0 and 1). The continuous
part of the model estimated change in the
frequency of HED or consequences for drinkers
who initially reported one or more instances of
these behaviors.
An important advantage of the two-part model
approach over the censored normal model [39] for
fitting discrete mixture models to longitudinal
zero-inflated data [39,40] is the ability to estimate
the unique effects of covariates on each of the
two parts even when they are correlated [37,38].
Two-part latent growth models, therefore, enable
the separate evaluation of intervention, mediating,
and covarying factors on onset and growth of
outcome variables. Thus, we were able to determine
whether our interventions affected mediators and
whether the mediators affected change in onset
and growth of outcome variables. We estimated the
effects of the brief motivational intervention, the
parent-based intervention, and their interaction on
all 10-month mediators regardless of an overall
intervention effect to determine whether the
intervention significantly changed the hypothe-
sized mediator(s) in the desired direction
and whether the mediator subsequently was
related to the outcome measure in the predicted
direction. This analysis is especially important for
discovering unexpected relationships that may
mask an overall intervention effect due to suppres-
sion effects [41].
Results
Successful recruitment of a representative sample of
1014 student­parent dyads was achieved across
2 cohort years with minimal refusal (Figure 1).

Interventions
Intervention delivery and fidelity
Among students randomly assigned to receive the
brief motivational intervention, 95% (n ¼ 476)
received the initial intervention (85% in-person,
and 15% by mail), and 90% (n ¼ 451) received the
booster session (90% in-person and 10% by mail).
Most students (!92%) endorsed key components of
the brief motivational intervention including high
clinician rapport, empathy, and professionalism.
Eighty-eight percent indicated feelings of enhanced
self-efficacy.
Among parents randomly assigned to receive the
parent intervention 89% (n ¼ 448) completed the
evaluation questionnaire by mail (n ¼ 368) or tele-
phone (n ¼ 80). Approximately, 89% of responding
parents reported being `very satisfied' or `mostly
satisfied' with the handbook as a whole and reading
`most' or `all' of the material. The handbook
chapters were rated as useful, interesting, and
understandable by approximately 84% of parents.
Data collection and outcomes
Student data reflected a wide range of drinking
behavior across all time points. As anticipated, data
for the primary outcomes contained a large number
of zero values (e.g., non-drinkers) and a large
proportion of students engaging in HED and/or
consequences. At baseline, 28% (n ¼ 281) of
students reported abstaining from alcohol for at
least the past year, decreasing to 17% (n ¼ 154) at
the 10-month follow-up, and 13% (n ¼ 112) at the
22-month follow-up (percentages adjusted for attri-
tion). Approximately, half of the baseline sample
(51%, n ¼ 517) reported no instances of HED in the
past month, and the mean number of conse-
quences experienced in the past 3 months was
5.39 (SD ¼ 7.67).
As reported elsewhere [42], the brief motiva-
tional intervention significantly reduced the onset
of HED and alcohol-related consequences at 10 and
22 months. However, the observed effects were
small and the parent-based intervention did not
reduce onset or growth of HED or consequences.
Evidence for the combined intervention effects was
limited to alcohol-related consequences, with no
effect observed for the combined intervention on
HED. In terms of mediation, we found a consistent
indirect brief motivational intervention effect
through descriptive norms on both onset and
growth in HED and consequences, but no evidence
in support of hypothesized parent-based interven-
tion mediators.
Limitations and lessons learned
While the Transitions Project was successful in
many respects, there are several limitations of this
trial. In attempting to evaluate potential explana-
tions for null and modest intervention effects,
several design issues initially considered in the
planning of this trial, re-emerged. Chief among
these include questions were: (1) did assessment
reactivity take place among parents and/or
students? (2) did our assessment schedule miss
critical short-term intervention effects?; and (3)
were our interventions delivered with fidelity?
We also have considered how these questions
could have been answered with alternative exper-
imental designs and study procedures.
The potential for assessment reactivity to atten-
uate or mask intervention effects is a serious and
common problem in clinical research and is espe-
cially problematic when the size of intervention
effects is modest [40,43]. We believe our assessment
protocol, which included an in-depth assessment of
process-related variables at baseline, may have
potentially masked parent-based intervention
effects by motivating control-group parents to
engage in behavior that may have reduced alcohol
use among students. Previous research has sought
to avoid this issue through the use of a post-test
only comparison design [30]. We opted for a
pre-test post-test design in order to better model
change over time. However, to disentangle inter-
vention and assessment effects, an alternative study
design is necessary, such as the Solomon Four
Group Design [44] which crosses two intervention
arms with baseline assessment (Yes/No). However,
in most large clinical trials this approach is prohib-
itively expensive and impractical. Newer, more
efficient, methods for evaluating assessment
reactivity are available which involve including
`planned missingness' in the assessment
design [45].
Another aspect of our study design that deserves
consideration is assessment timing. In the social
sciences assessment, timing is often dictated by
convenience or tradition rather than empirically
based expectations regarding intervention effect
periods [46]. We reviewed relevant research and
found that intervention efficacy was well docu-
mented through a 6-month follow-up period for
brief motivational interventions, with several
exceptions [47,48]. For this reason, we decided to
focus on longer term outcome assessments to
determine whether these interventions could
produce lasting change. The use of lengthy assess-
ments coupled with generous and increasing
participation incentives enabled strong tests of
the primary and secondary aims but used a large
210 AC Fernandez et al.
Clinical Trials 2011; 8: 205­213 http://ctj.sagepub.com
proportion of study resources, thus limiting our
ability to afford a short-term assessment. Upon
completion of this trial, we believe our null find-
ings reflect a failure to capture critical periods of
short-term intervention effects that decayed over
time. Therefore, we recommend using three follow-
up time points in combination with a baseline
assessment to detect long-term and short-term,
potentially transient, intervention effects and to
model non-linear (e.g., quadratic, piecewise)
effects.
Our lack of objective intervention fidelity
measures is an additional limitation of this trial.
Subjective measures of intervention fidelity
employed by this study indicated the interventions
were delivered as intended, but a lack of objective
measures limits the strength of our inferences.
Consistent with prior research [30], our parent
handbook evaluation asked parents whether they
read and understood the intervention materials.
Parents may have provided socially desirable
responses; the non-anonymous nature of the
assessment may have exacerbated this effect.
Similarly, participants in the brief motivational
intervention were asked about clinician qualities
and intervention components. Although their
responses were collected anonymously after
sessions, the possibility of subjective biases cannot
be ruled out. In fact, our measures of intervention
fidelity were relatively high and invariant across
all categories for both interventions suggesting
the possibility of social desirability and ceiling
effects.
Ideally, future studies should examine the qual-
ity of intervention delivery using objective means,
such as delivering the handbook online and track-
ing parent access. In terms of the brief motivational
intervention, future trials should audio or video-
record sessions and have them coded by at least two
independent reviewers. Detailed, more objective
procedures for assessing brief motivational inter-
vention fidelity are available and increasingly
expected in clinical trials [49,50]. Nonetheless, our
supervision approach and the brief motivational
intervention training we employed have been used
in previous randomized controlled trials that
obtained very good estimates of motivational
interviewing consistency [10,51,52].
Conclusions
In conclusion, the Transitions Project had many
strengths, most notably the use of a factorial design
capable of testing unique and combined effects of
two potentially complementary interventions and
the implementation of novel data-analytic tech-
niques uniquely suited to our data. Limitations
included our inability to explicate the extent to
which assessment reactivity or the length of our
follow-up interval may help explain the lack of
support for some study hypotheses.
In terms of study successes, a large sample of
students and parents were recruited prior to college
matriculation. Consistent with other research
works, the use of monetary ballooning incentives
and a highly trained survey center was likely
integral to recruitment and long-term retention
success [31,53,54]. Intervention administration and
participation were also high. Abstainers and drin-
kers were willing to attend in-person interventions
and parents were willing to read mailed interven-
tion materials and return evaluation forms. These
participation and retention rates should encourage
future researchers who attempt to use similar
techniques and study similar populations.
By including abstainers in our study, we were able
to examine intervention effects among an at-risk
but understudied group. The data complexity, the
abstainers introduced (e.g., a high-zero count) was
handled using latent growth curve modeling as an
alternative to traditional data transformation.
As published examples of two-part latent growth
curve modeling are limited, interested readers are
directed to our outcomes paper [42] and other
published studies using this technique [29,38].
In summary, the choice of experimental and
quasi-experimental designs in randomized con-
trolled trials is a complex, multi-faceted endeavor
with inevitable tradeoffs. We hope that consider-
ation of the lessons we have learned and presented
will benefit those who undertake similar research in
the future.
