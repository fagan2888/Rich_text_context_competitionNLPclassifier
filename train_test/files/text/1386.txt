Objectives: Recent evidence suggests that it is important to
consider behavioral specific sexual violence measures in assessing
women's risk behaviors. This study investigated associations of history
and types of sexual coercion on HIV risk behaviors in a nationally
representative sample of heterosexually active American women.
Methods: Analyses were based on 5857 women aged 18­44
participating in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. Types of
lifetime sexual coercion included: victim given alcohol or drugs,
verbally pressured, threatened with physical injury, and physically
injured. Associations with HIV risk behaviors were assessed using
logistic regression.
Results: Of 5857 heterosexually active women, 16.4% reported
multiple sex partners and 15.3% reported substance abuse. A coerced
first sexual intercourse experience and coerced sex after sexual debut
were independently associated with multiple sex partners and
substance abuse; the highest risk was observed for women reporting
a coerced first sexual intercourse experience. Among types of sexual
coercion, alcohol or drug use at coerced sex was independently
associated with multiple sex partners and substance abuse.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that public health strategies are
needed to address the violent components of heterosexual relation-
ships. Future research should utilize longitudinal and qualitative
research to characterize the relationship between continuums of
sexual coercion and HIV risk.

INTRODUCTION
More than 25 years into the AIDS epidemic, HIV
infection remains a significant public health problem in the
lives of women in the United States. In 2006, women
accounted for 27% of new HIV diagnoses, and high-risk
heterosexual contact was the source for 80% of these infec-
tions.1 Minority women are disproportionately affected by
HIV infection. In 2006, the HIV diagnosis rate for African
American women (56.2 per 100,000) and Hispanic women
(15.1 per 100,000) far exceeded that for white women (2.9 per
100,000).2 Within the past decade, sexual violence has been
implicated as an important risk factor for HIV infection in
women.3,4 Understanding how the dynamics of sexual vio-
lence affects HIV risk is imperative to develop comprehensive
intervention and prevention efforts to combat the epidemic.
Sexual violence, including a forced first sexual in-
tercourse, has been consistently shown to be associated with
a number of HIV risk behaviors, including sex with multiple
partners, inconsistent condom use, higher rates of sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs), unprotected anal sex, and sub-
stance abuse.5­14 However, due to the wide range of experi-
ences often grouped under the category of Ôsexual violenceÕ
in HIV research, we cannot determine whether HIV risk
behaviors are different for women based on the how they were
coerced into sex (eg, through the use of verbal coercion,
threats without injury, physical force, and/or use of alcohol or
drugs). Researchers have proposed that it is important to
consider behavioral specific types of sexual violence on
a continuum of severity in reporting prevalence estimates and

sexual violence or coercion has been documented in different
populations.15,16,18,22­24 In one of the few national stratified
random samples of college women (n = 4446), 7.7% experi-
enced sexual contact involving physical force or threats of
physical force, and 11.0% experienced unwanted sex without
force.24 Basile16 employed a continuum of sexual coercion that
included having unwanted sex after begging and pleading,
because of perceived duty, after a romantic situation, or after
the use of physical force. Among 602 adult women reporting
coerced sex by an intimate partner, variations in lifetime
prevalence estimates were observed that ranged from 12%
for women who had unwanted sex after verbal threats to 38%
for women who thought it was their duty to have sex. Of
note, 17% of women reported unwanted sex after the use of
physical force.16
The proposed mechanisms linking sexual violence to the
engagement of HIV risk behaviors include heightened sexual
behavior, easy arousal, and/or psychopathology (eg, depres-
sion, posttraumatic stress disorder, and low self-esteem)
leading to the inability to negotiate safe sexual behaviors.3,4,25
In addition, women who experience sexual coercion are more
likely to abuse alcohol and/or drugs as a coping mecha-
nism.6,26 Previous research has identified higher depression
scores, lower self-esteem, and lower self-assertiveness among
women experiencing verbally coerced sex compared with
those experiencing physically forced sex.26­28 These findings
coupled with the mediating effects of psychopathology in the
pathway between sexual violence and HIV risk behaviors
make it plausible that women who experience less severe
forms of sexual coercion (verbal coercion and threats without
injury) may have increased rates of psychopathology resulting
in increased risk of HIV risk behaviors compared with those
who experience more severe forms of sexual coercion
(physically forced sex).
Despite the significance of the intersecting epidemics of
sexual violence and HIVas public health problems, knowledge
of this association has largely been limited to convenience
samples and has used variable definitions of sexual violence.
This has hindered the ability to fully characterize this
association and generalize findings to the US population.
This study examines history and types of sexual coercion in
a nationally representative sample of heterosexually active
women aged 18­44. The objectives were to (1) examine the
association between history of sexual coercion and HIV risk
behaviors and (2) assess the strength of associations between
types of sexual coercion and HIV risk behaviors among
a subsample of women reporting sexual coercion.
METHODS
Study Population
The study population was drawn from the 2002 National
Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The NSFG is conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention to investigate topics related to
childbearing and reproductive health for US women (and for
the first time in 2002, US men). Details of the 2002 NSFG
have been published elsewhere.29 Briefly, the 2002 NSFG
includes a nationally representative sample of civilian
noninstitutionalized women (n = 7643) and men (n = 4928)
aged 15­44 years. Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, and teens
were selected with higher probability than other individuals to
produce more reliable statistics for these groups.
Data were collected through household interviews
between March 2002 and March 2003 with an overall
response rate of 80% for women. Interviews were conducted
in person using computer-assisted personal interviewing.
However, to collect sensitive information on respondents'
substance use, HIV/STD risk behaviors, and unwanted sexual
experiences, audio computer-assisted self-interviewing was
used. Participants who completed the interview received $40
for their participation.
The study population for this study was restricted to
women aged 18 years and older at the time of interview and
who reported a male sex partner in the past year. Women under
18 years of age were excluded because they were not asked
questions about their history of sexual coercion. Of 7643
women interviewed in 2002, 674 (8.8%) were under 18 years
of age. Of 6969 women aged 18 years and older, 6389 (91.7%)
reported ever having vaginal sex with a male, of whom 480
(7.5%) did not report a male sex partner in the past year.
Information regarding sexual coercion and HIV risk behavior
measures were missing from 52 women who were excluded
from the analysis. In total, 5857 women (76.6% overall) met
the inclusion criteria and form the study population for this
analysis. This secondary data analysis was considered exempt
from review by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional
Review Board.
Measures
The outcome measures were 3 HIV risk behaviors: (1)
multiple sex partners, (2) no condom use at last vaginal sex,
and (3) substance abuse. Multiple sex partners were defined as
2 or more male sex partners in the past year. No condom use at
last vaginal sex was assessed by reporting whether or not
a condom was used at last vaginal intercourse. Substance
abuse was defined as use of crack, cocaine, nonprescription
injection drugs, or 5 or more alcoholic drinks within a couple
of hours (binge drinking)30 at least once a month, all in the past
year. A summary dichotomous variable for substance abuse
was derived by combining dichotomized responses to the drug
use and binge drinking questions.
The exposure of interest was sexual violence character-
istics. Sexual violence variables included history of sexual
coercion and types of sexual coercion. History of sexual
coercion was determined by a series of questions. Participants
were first asked to assess the degree to which the first vaginal
intercourse was wanted using the following categories:
wanted, unwanted, or mixed feelings. Participants were then
asked, ``Would you say that the first vaginal intercourse was
voluntary or not voluntary, that is, did you choose to have sex
of your own free will or not?'' Participants who reported their
first vaginal intercourse as not voluntary, unwanted, or with
mixed feelings were asked additional questions on the
behavioral specific nature of the experience; those who
reported being threatened with injury, physically injured,

physically held down, or given alcohol or drugs at the time of
their first vaginal intercourse were classified as having
a coerced first sexual intercourse experience. To assess
subsequent coerced sexual intercourse experiences, partic-
ipants with a history of a coerced first sexual intercourse were
asked, ``Besides the time you already reported, have you ever
been forced by a male to have vaginal intercourse against your
will?'' Because only 287 participants (5.0%) reported both
a coerced first sexual intercourse and subsequent experience,
these women were grouped with those having only a coerced
first sexual intercourse experience. Participants who reported
a first sexual intercourse that was voluntary were asked, ``Have
you ever been forced by a male to have vaginal intercourse
against your will?'' Participants who reported a first sexual
intercourse that was voluntary and a subsequent experience
that was forced were classified as experiencing a coerced
sexual intercourse experience after sexual debut. Types of
sexual coercion consisted of the following dichotomous
groups: (1) verbally pressured, without threats of harm; (2)
threatened with physical injury; (3) physically injured or held
down; and (4) given alcohol or drugs, all assessed during
a woman's lifetime. These groups were not mutually exclusive.
Further, there was no information on the frequency of
experiencing each type of coercion.
Potential confounders included in the analysis were
demographic and first sexual relationship variables. De-
mographic variables examined were age, race/ethnicity, educa-
tion, poverty level, health insurance, marital status, and
number of children younger than 18 living in the household.
The first vaginal intercourse variables included age at first
vaginal sex, age difference of first partner, and type of
relationship with partner. Type of relationship with partner was
categorized into 2 groups: committed (``married to him,''
``engaged to him,'' ``living together in a sexual relationship,
but not engaged,'' or ``going with him or going steady'') and
less committed (``going out with him once in a while,'' ``just
friends,'' ``had just met him,'' or ``something else'').
Statistical Analysis
Weighted percents and Rao-Scott x2 test were used to
describe the relationships among the demographic, first
vaginal intercourse, sexual violence variables, and HIV risk
behavior outcomes. A series of logistic regression analyses
were conducted for the following dependent variables: (1)
multiple sex partners in the past year, (2) no condom use at last
sex, and (3) substance abuse in the past year. Factors
considered statistically significant at a P value of 0.05 or
lower in bivariate analyses or were theoretically relevant were
included in the final multivariate regression models. For each
dependent variable, 2 sets of multivariate regressions were
performed to determine the independent effects of history of
sexual coercion among the entire study sample and types of
sexual coercion among women reporting sexual coercion.
Estimates of odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were
obtained using sampling weights provided by National Center
for Health Statistics. Weighted estimates are generalizable to
the US population of women 18­44 years old. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.31
RESULTS
Characteristics of Participants
The majority of women were non-Hispanic white
(67.4%) and equal proportions were non-Hispanic black and
Hispanic. Over three-fourths were at least 25 years of age.
Approximately 90% of women had at least a high school
diploma or GED, but 44.4% were in the 300% or greater
poverty level. Even so, only 15.5% of women were medically
uninsured. Nearly two-thirds (63.3%) had at least 1 child
younger than 18 in the household, and 67.9% were married or
living with a male partner. Most women had their first vaginal
intercourse before age 20 (81.7%) with 26.9% of women
experiencing this before age 16; however, most of the
relationships were committed (78.8%). One quarter (25.5%)
of women had a partner who was of the same age or younger or
1­2 years older (37.5%), whereas 17.9% had a partner who
was at least 5 years older.
Approximately 1 in 4 women reported a lifetime coerced
sex experience, of whom 12.5% experienced a coerced first
sexual intercourse. Among 1408 women reporting sexual
coercion, 34.6% were 15 years old or younger at the time of
their first coerced sex. The largest proportion of this group of
women reported being physically injured or held down
(67.2%). The next largest group of women reported being
pressured with words but without threats of harm (57.2%).
Two fifths of women (41.0%) were threatened with injury at
the time of their coerced sex experience. Approximately, 30%
of women were given alcohol or drugs.
Prevalence of individual HIV risk behaviors varied in
the study population. Sixteen percent of women had multiple
sex partners in the past year, and 15.3% engaged in substance
abuse (Table 1). Women with multiple sex partners were more
likely to be aged 18­24, non-Hispanic black, low poverty
level, young age at first sex, have a less committed first partner,
and an older first partner. Women who reported substance
abuse were more likely to be aged 18­24, young age at first
sex, and have a less committed first partner but were less likely
to have a college degree. Because almost 70% of the sample
was married or cohabitating and having a main partner has
been shown in the literature to be associated with decreased
condom use,32 only women who reported more than 1 male sex
partner in the past year (n = 1085) were included in the
analysis for no condom use at last vaginal sex. Among 1085
women with more than 1 male sex partner in the past year,
69.0% reported no condom use at last vaginal sex. These
women were less likely to be aged 18­24 and non-Hispanic
black, but more likely to be married.
History of Sexual Coercion and HIV
Risk Behaviors
Women with history of a coerced first sexual intercourse
were 2.2, 1.4, and 2.1 times more likely to have multiple sex
partners, unprotected vaginal sex, and engage in substance
abuse, respectively, compared with women without a history
of sexual coercion (Table 2). Those with a history of sexual
coercion after sexual debut were 1.9, 1.6, and 1.6 times more
likely to have multiple sex partners, unprotected vaginal sex,
and abuse substances, respectively. After adjusting for

demographic and first sexual relationship characteristics,
history of sexual coercion was significantly associated with
multiple sex partners and substance abuse. Women who
experienced a coerced first sexual intercourse had a 1.9-fold
increase in having multiple sex partners compared with
women without a history of sexual coercion; those who
reported sexual coercion after sexual debut had a 1.7-fold
increase in risk. In addition, women who reported a coerced
first sexual intercourse had a 1.6-fold increase in engaging in
substance abuse compared with women without a history of

sexual coercion; those who experienced sexual coercion after
sexual debut had a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of engaging in
substance abuse. History of sexual coercion was not associated
with unprotected vaginal sex.
Type of Sexual Coercion and HIV
Risk Behaviors
Women who were threatened with injury at coerced sex
were more likely to have unprotected vaginal sex compared
with their counterparts (Table 3). Women who were given
alcohol or drugs at coerced sex were more likely to have
multiple sex partners and engage in substance abuse. No
associations with HIV risk behaviors were found for women
who were pressured with words but without threats or
physically injured. After adjusting for demographic and first
vaginal sex characteristics, only being given alcohol or drugs
at coerced sex was significantly associated with at least 1 HIV
risk behavior. Women who were given alcohol or drugs at
coerced sex were almost 2 times more likely to report multiple
sex partners and substance abuse compared with those not
given alcohol or drugs.
DISCUSSION
We observed a positive relationship between history of
sexual coercion and all of the measured HIV risk behaviors. In

bivariate and multivariate analyses, women reporting a coerced
first sexual intercourse experienced the highest risk for having
multiple sex partners and engaging in substance abuse,
followed by women reporting a coerced sex after sexual debut.
For unprotected vaginal sex, similar increased risks were
observed for each category of sexual coercion history.
However, in multivariate analyses, significance was not
observed for any category of sexual coercion history. These
findings are consistent with previous research addressing the
importance of coerced first sexual intercourse and life-
time coerced sex on adverse health effects, including the
engagement of high-risk behaviors.33­35 Additionally, this
demonstrates the association between a history of sexual
coercion and HIV risk behaviors in a nationally representative
sample of heterosexually active reproductive aged women,
which adds to existing research that has been limited to
convenience samples.5
Among the subsample of women reporting sexual
coercion, only being given alcohol or drugs at coerced sex was
independently and significantly associated with multiple sex
partners and substance abuse. These women may feel more
victimized than others because of lack of control due to
intoxication. Attempts to regain a sense of control may be
achieved by engaging in risk behaviors such as having sex with
multiple partners and exchanging sex for money or drugs.
Future substance abuse is also likely because it serves as
a coping mechanism.6,36 Women who are given substances at
coerced sex may have a different risk profile than their
counterparts. Certainly, further research is needed to in-
corporate the entire context of alcohol-induced or drug-
induced coerced sex events such as the location, type of
sex partner, and partner's use of substances at the time of
the incident.37,38
Being threatened with injury at coerced sex was only
significantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex in
bivariate analyses but not in multivariate analyses. This is
consistent with previous research that found verbally coerced
women more likely to have reduced self-esteem,27,28 reduced
self-assertiveness,27 and higher rates of depression28 compared
with women physically forced into sex, often linked to a lack
of condom negotiation skills. Lack of significance in the
multivariate analysis may be related to a mediated relationship
with these kinds of psychosocial variables not measured
and/or a reduction in sample size and consequent statistical
power to detect significant differences after subsetting to
women at risk for this outcome.
The large nationally representative sample of hetero-
sexually active women aged 18­44 and detailed assessment of
history and type of sexual coercion are strengths of the current
study. In particular, the data allowed for the assessment of
nonconsensual first intercourse on HIV risk behaviors, which
has been shown to influence subsequent sexual decision
making and risk behaviors. However, the study is not without
limitations. Although the response rate was high, there still
may be unmeasured bias present from women who refused to
participate. Further, women who were not sexually active and
excluded from the analyses differed from those reporting
sexual activity. However, the prevalence of women reporting
treatment for STDs in the past year in the 2002 NSFG was
3.5%--higher than both the National Health Interview Survey
(2.7%), which asked about treatment in the previous 5 years39
and the 2002 US national estimate of women treated for
chlamydia (445.0 per 100,000) and gonorrhea (122.5 per
100,000).40 This indicates that this study population effec-
tively captures the potential risk for acquiring HIV infection
given the STD prevalence.
Although HIV risk behavior outcomes were assessed in
the previous year or at last event, the cross-sectional design
limited the ability to establish relative temporality of
continuums of sexual coercion and women's HIV risk
behaviors. The data relied on self-reports from interviews,
and it is likely that history of sexual coercion and participation
in risk behaviors were underreported; however, because audio
computer-assisted self-interviewing techniques were em-
ployed to collect this information, it is likely that under-
reporting was reduced. In addition, there was no information
on HIV status, so multiple sex partners, substance abuse, and
unprotected vaginal sex were chosen as proxies for HIV risk.
Although the proxy, multiple sex partners, is one element of
the risk and does not take into account the timing and
overlapping nature of sexual partnerships, the literature on
women with a history of sexual violence indicates that the risk
of HIV is highly associated with heterosexual sex through
multiple relationships. Similarly, the proxies, substance abuse
and unprotected vaginal sex are consistent with those used in
the literature addressing the intersecting epidemics of sexual
violence and HIV/AIDS.6,7,10,25 It is important to note
however, that different patterns of relationships between drug
use and sexual coercion and alcohol abuse and sexual coercion
have been documented. Also, the available measures of sexual
coercion were not comprehensive. These questions were
limited to women aged 18 years and older, so we do not know
if similar associations exist for females aged 15­17, also
targeted and oversampled in the 2002 NSFG. For each type of
sexual coercion, there was no information on when the
incident occurred; if it occurred multiple times; and for those
experiencing more than 1 type of coerced sex experience,
whether the same male partner perpetrated each act. In
particular, assessment of women given alcohol or drugs at the
time of sexual coercion was limited because of the inability to
determine if these women were forced by their partner to use
substances or willingly accepted the offer to use substances.
Because types of sexual coercion were not mutually exclusive
events, it was difficult to determine their isolated effects on
HIV risk behaviors. The NSFG did not allow for assessment
of physical intimate partner violence, which has been shown
to co-occur with sexual intimate partner violence for some
women. The interacting effects of these 2 forms of violence,
taking into account types of sexual coercion, may result
in differential risks for engaging in HIV risk behaviors.
Despite these shortcomings, the 2002 NSFG provided
valuable information on the dynamics of sexual coercion
and its association with women's HIV risk behaviors in the
United States.
Further research is needed to replicate and expand upon
these findings. The context of the partner relationship to sexual
violence should be explored. For instance, it is possible that
some abusive male partners may use less severe tactics to

coerce women into forced sex at the beginning of a relationship
but may transition to progressively more severe tactics over
time. These cumulative effects of sexual violence may result in
different HIV risk profiles for women at different stages of
a relationship. Future research should also use behavioral-
specific sexual violence measures to examine associations
between forced anal sex and HIV risk behaviors. Longitudinal,
theory-driven research with the incorporation of depression
and posttraumatic stress disorder as potential mediators in the
pathway of continuums of sexual coercion and HIV risk
should be examined with mediation analyses. Finally, although
recognizing the utility of prior qualitative research addressing
continuums of sexual violence,15,21 additional qualitative and
mixed methods approaches are imperative to advance un-
derstanding of these intersecting epidemics.
Although preliminary in nature, these findings have
important implications for interventions targeted toward
reducing the risk of HIV infection among women. As public
health practitioners work to develop interventions designed to
simultaneously reduce HIVand partner violence and attendant
substance abuse, continuums of sexual coercion should be
addressed. HIV prevention for women coerced into sex by
their partners may require different strategies based on the
history, especially a coerced first intercourse experience, and
type of sexual coercion experienced. Future research may
assist clinicians and practitioners in how they address sexual
violence, especially with the recognition of less severe forms
of sexual violence contributing to the engagement of HIV
risk behaviors, and potential intervention opportunities at
multiple points if mental health outcomes are identified as
mediators in the relationship. A more discriminating under-
standing of the nature of sexual violence as it relates to HIV
will assist in development of structural level changes to
enforce condom use by male perpetrators, empowering women
to improve their self-esteem and self-assertiveness, and
encourage the use of female-controlled prevention methods
such as vaginal microbicides.
