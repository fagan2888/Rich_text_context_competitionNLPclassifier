Introduction to Luo Shu
In this section, the significance of Luo Shu to the Chinese
culture will be discussed so that we could understand the rea-
son why it is worth to take effort to study Luo Shu and related
applications in a more scientific manner.
According to Joseph Needham (Needham & Wang 1959),
probably the mostly renowned scientist and sinologist study-
ing the history of Chinese science, one ancient Chinese inter-
est was in combinatorial analysis, the construction of magic
figures, where numbers were arranged in such a way the
logistic operations could be performed. In the book, on page
57, two drawings were depicted, namely, He Tu (the River
Diagram) and Luo Shu (Luo River Writing). Accordingly,
these two names were mentioned in Lun Yu (Conversations
and Discourses of Confucius) written in the fifth century
BCE and then Yi Jing (Book of Changes). But there was no
detail about the two diagrams mentioned in Lun Yu, that is,
the exact arrangement of the dots on the diagram.
According to Ho (2003), in the Mingtang chapter of Dai
De's Da Dai Liji (Record of Rites by the Elder Dai), a work
dated approximately to the year 80 CE showed the arrange-
ment of numbers from "1" to "9" in three sets, that is, 2-9-4,
7-5-3, and 6-1-8. These three sets of numbers, as can be seen
in a later paragraph, resemble Luo Shu closely. Prof. Ho had
been a 40-year research associate of Prof. Needham, Head of
Department of Chinese of The University of Hong Kong
from 1981 to 1987 and later director of Needham Research
Institute at Cambridge from 1990 to 2001. The purpose of
these numbers was not explained in the Da Dai Liji, probably
associated with the nine halls at which the Zhou emperors
(1045 BCE-256 BCE) performed their ceremonial rites. It
was generally agreed that the two diagrams had dominated
Chinese thought since ancient times.
The first printed version of He Tu and Luo Shu appeared
in the Song Dynasty, written by the famous Daoist Chen
Tuan in the 10th century CE and then Cai Yuanding (1145
CE-1198 CE), disciple of the famous Confuciust, Zhu Xi
(1130 CE-1220 CE), shown in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 2 is
called the "Original Luo Shu" throughout this article. Ho
(p.20, 2003) further said that,
He Tu does not qualify as a modern magic square and has been
put aside by modern scholars studying Chinese magic squares .
. . . However, to the traditional Chinese mathematician, the two
figures are of equal importance, both mystically and
philosophically.

Luo Shu: Ancient Chinese Magic Square
on Linear Algebra
Albert Ting Pat So1,2, Eric Lee1, Kin Lun Li2,
and Dickson Koon Sing Leung2
Abstract
Feng Shui, still popularly practiced today, was closely related to philosophy, natural science, geography, environmental
science, architecture, metaphysics, and astrology in ancient China. It is basically divided into the Form School and the
Compass School. The latter deals with numerology, calculation, orientation, and time. Luo Shu [], associated with the
eight trigrams [], being an ancient Chinese magic square, forms the foundation of the Compass School. The original Luo
Shu, a 3 × 3 magic square, was not unique in ancient China but the extension of it to a total of 18 to 36 standard charts was
unique, which are still used by all Compass School Feng Shui masters. In this article, modern linear algebra, developed only
in the mid-19th century, is employed to prove that there is a strong coherence between the 36 charts if they are treated
as 36 matrices and such correspondences conscientiously agree with ancient theories of Feng Shui. This article may help to
form a scientific base for the systematic understanding, development, and further research of Luo Shu­related applications.

In this article, the discussion is focused on Luo Shu.
In his book, on pages 5 and 6, Ho discussed the impor-
tance of the three cosmic boards () to the Chinese his-
tory and pointed out two out of these three boards were
mainly concerned with the Luo Shu magic square. It is
because these boards were believed to be secretly manipu-
lated by the Astronomical Bureau to assist the emperors to
predict astronomical events as well as human actions.
The three cosmic boards are Tai Yi ( or ), Dun
Jia (), and Liu Ren (). Tai Yi was the origin of the
most popular Flying Stars method used nowadays. On page
25 of his book, Ho further discussed the principle of move-
ment within the nine palaces, known to the practitioners of
the art as feigong (flying palaces or flying stars in the modern
term). The movement could either be in a clockwise direc-
tion (shunfei, that is, forward flying) or in an anticlockwise
direction (nifei, that is, backward flying). In this way, 18
variations of the Luo Shu are produced, as detailed by Smith
(1993), shown below in Table 1.
These 18 charts, including the original Luo Shu--the first
one shaded in Table 1--are called standard charts that are
popularly used by contemporary Feng Shui masters of the
Compass School. In some schools of Qi Men Dun Jia, 18
more charts are used, resulting in a total of 36 standard
charts. But as seen in a later section of this article, 27 out of
the 36 charts could be easily produced by the 9 standard "for-
ward flying" charts developed from the original Luo Shu.
One immediate observation of the original Luo Shu is that
any three numbers along a row, a column, or a diagonal,
when added together, give a sum of "15." This fact was also
well known in the western world.
The discovery of the original Luo Shu was not unique in
ancient China. Magic squares were found in old Persia
around the 10th century CE from the manuscript of Buzjani,
a mathematician (Hogendijk & Sabra, 2003). They were also
known to Islamic mathematicians in Arabia as early as the
7th century CE. These squares are not only limited to an
order of 3, while orders of 4, 5, and higher are also available.
The 3 × 3 magic square has been a part of rituals in India
since Vedic times and is still used today; the Ganesh yantra
of ancient India is a 3 × 3 magic square. The 4 × 4 magic
square was displayed in the Parshvanath Jain temple by 10th
century CE. However, it seems that there was no special
application in terms of divination of such magic square out-
side China in the ancient times. And furthermore, as dis-
cussed in following sections, there are 35 additional
variations of Luo Shu, and all these 36 variations are useful
in Feng Shui study, though 18 of them are more popular
nowadays. Nothing on such variations was found elsewhere
except in ancient China. Once the Luo Shu is varied, the
characteristic of "added together equals 15" immediately
disappears. That may explain why variations did not draw
attention outside China.
Regarding the exact date of existence of Luo Shu, a recent
archaeological discovery in the spring of 1977 confirmed
that it existed well before 80 CE as described in Da Dai Liji.
Archaeologists discovered a tomb of the Western Han
Dynasty built around second century BCE at the City of
Fuyang in the province of Anhui, China. Inside the tomb,
several of the oldest astronomical instruments were unearthed
and Luo Shu was printed on one panel called 
 (Divination Pan of the Supreme Unity moving around
Nine Palaces), shown in Figure 3. With the mentioning of
Luo Shu in Yi Jing, we have confidence in believing that Luo
Shu existed long before 500 BCE. Then, two modern appli-
cations of Luo Shu and the extended standard charts are to be
briefly discussed.
Applications of Luo Shu and Its
Extended Charts in the Compass
School
The previous section was mainly on historical development
from a cultural perspective. For Feng Shui study and applica-
tions, readers could refer to Skinner (2006/1976) and Walters
(1991). The practice of Feng Shui could roughly be catego-
rized into two schools, namely, the Form School and the
Figure 2. Luo Shu writing.

Compass School (Mak & So, 2011, 2015; Skinner,
2006/1976). The Form School studies landscape and water
flow. Mountains and ridges are believed to be the source of
Qi, the name of energy or natural force in all schools of
Chinese studies, including medicine, martial arts, and meta-
physics. The Qi flows down from high mountains and is dis-
persed by wind and stopped by water. So, a good site,
according to the Form School, should have tall mountains at
the back and flowing river in the front. By the two sides,
there should be low ridges, called azure dragon on the left
and white tiger on the right. Air movement, but not strong, at
the site is necessary and the river should be concave to the
site with flowing water. In other words, a dead pond of water
is not favorable. The Form School deals with the form only,
and therefore, it has no temporal concern. The Compass
School concerns both space, in terms of directions, and time.
After a good site is selected, the Compass School directs
Feng Shui masters to determine the orientation or facing
direction of the building as well as the best time to erect the
building. It therefore involves the extensive use of the com-
pass, as the name tells, which is professionally called "Luo
Pan" in Feng Shui study. The whole circle of 360 is divided
into 24 sectors, called mountains. Each mountain has a span
of 15, as shown in Figure 4. Here, two applications of the
Compass School are briefly introduced.
Flying Stars method is the analysis of Qi and the subse-
quent patterns generated in accordance with the geomagnetic
Table 1. Eighteen Variations of Luo Shu.

directional patterns that affect the building structures in
which we live and work. A detailed discussion on the Flying
Stars method could be found in Skinner (2003). Although Qi
may technically be more than merely a geomagnetic force, it
is traditionally believed to be illustrated by geomagnetic and
other physical forces, like air flow patterns and so forth.
To dwell in a house, it is essential to determine the best
locations for all doors and the allocation of main rooms to
harness the beneficial distribution of Qi. The stars referred to
here are not real stars up in the sky; they are merely numbers
of Luo Shu moving around the nine, 3 × 3, palaces. Fortune
cycles, totally nine, of 20 years each are used to determine
the number placed at the central palace. The seventh Fortune
Cycle commenced on February 4, 1984 (The Year of Jia-Zi
[] in the Sexagenary cycle) and ended on February 3,
2004, to be precise. Now, we are within the eighth Fortune
Cycle, from February 4, 2004 to February 3, 2024. Based on
the sequence of numbers in the original Luo Shu, the proper
sequence of placement of stars, or the flying trajectory, is
according to a standard pattern, as shown in Figure 5. By
comparing the first chart of Table 1 and Figure 5, readers
could immediately notice the logic of this flying trajectory.
Figure 6 shows the chart for the current eighth Fortune Cycle,
which is created by putting the number or star "8" at the cen-
tral palace, and other numbers are placed according to Figure
5. This chart refers to the period of time under study, called
the Time Chart. The original Luo Shu's arrangement with
"5" at the central palace is called Earth Chart. Figure 5 shows
the forward flying trajectory while a backward flying trajec-
tory is also possible as shown in Table 1.
Then, the facing direction of a house built within the
period of time and the sitting direction (180 opposite to the
facing direction) of that house generate two more charts. The
original Luo Shu was associated with directions, with "9"
pointing south, "1" pointing north, "3" pointing east, and "7"
pointing west. It has been an established convention that
"south" is always put at the top of a chart and "north" at the
bottom, which is analogue to the emperor sitting in his palace
in northern China, say at Beijing, and looking south over his
own nation. Based on the facing or sitting directions, two
numbers at the corresponding palaces will be put at the cen-
tral palace and therefore two more charts are produced and
merged together, like the one shown in Figure 7 where there
are three stars in each palace.
Figure 7 shows the full Flying Stars chart (three charts
combined together) of a house built within the seventh
Fortune Cycle (from February 4, 1984 to February 3, 2004),
facing east. The star "5" at the eastern palace of the Time
Chart is brought to the upper right-handed corner of the cen-
tral palace, thus forming the Facing Chart, and the star "9" at
the western palace (sitting direction) of the Time Chart is
brought to the upper left-handed corner of the central palace,
thus forming the Sitting (also called Mountain) Chart. The
logic of placement (forward or backward) of other stars in
the Facing and Sitting Charts is beyond the scope of this
article. Based on these three charts, Feng Shui masters could
tell whether the house in general is auspicious or not and
could even make comments on the use of every room corre-
sponding to each of the nine palaces.
In the Flying Stars method, there are two types of charts
that are believed to be auspicious besides other concerns, as
shown in Figures 8 and 9. In Figure 8, all stars in every palace
belong to one of three configurations, namely, "1-4-7," "2-5-
8," or "3-6-9," sequence being flexible. These three configu-
rations are called "The Three Big Trigrams ."
However, this is just one version, the most popular version,
in fact, of the theory of "The Three Big Trigrams." There are
Figure 5. Placement of numbers (stars) in the nine-palace chart.
Figure 6. Time chart of eighth Fortune Cycle.
Figure 7. Final flying stars chart of a house facing east built
within the seventh Fortune Cycle.
Figure 8. Facing south-west built in eighth Fortune Cycle.

others, such as "1-2-3," "4-5-6," "7-8-9," and so forth. In
Figure 9, every star of the Time Chart when added to the
corresponding star of the Sitting Chart always gives "10,"
such configuration being called "Combined to Ten."
These two configurations are important in our further
elaboration.
This article is not on the Flying Stars method. Readers are
just reminded to pay attention to the 18 to 36 possible stan-
dard charts merged together, the special "Three Big
Trigrams," and "Combined to Ten."
Another application of Luo Shu is called Qi Men Dun Jia,
which was widely used in the war fields by generals in the
ancient times to determine the best time and bearing to attack
and retreat. In addition to the three charts in Flying Stars
method, Qi Men Dun Jia uses four charts altogether, super-
imposed on top of one another or merged together as in
Flying Stars method, called Heaven (), Earth (),
Man (), and Spirit (). All the 18 standard charts of
Flying Stars method are used while two more types are
sometimes added for every forward flying chart. That is, to
rotate the chart either +90 or -90 with the central star
unchanged as the pivot of rotation. Figure 10 shows the orig-
inal chart with say "4" at the central palace, that is, the Time
Chart of the fourth Fortune Cycle; Figure 11 shows that
rotated by +90; Figure 12 shows that rotated by -90. In this
case, 18 more charts are added, with a total of 36 standard
charts.
According to the method of Qi Men Dun Jia, every year is
divided into 4,320 sets () under 18 categories, half belong-
ing to Yin and half belonging to Yang. But the variation in
sets is slightly different year by year. Each set can be repre-
sented by four charts, chosen from the 36 standard charts
mentioned above, and Feng Shui masters refer to the charts
to give comments and divine.
Readers are once again recommended to pay attention
only to the configuration or structure of these standard charts
as the discussion on them is the key issue of this article.
These 18 to 36 standard charts have been used by Feng Shui
masters for centuries. In this article, they are treated not as
charts or grids or palaces, not as magic squares anymore, but
as matrices of modern linear algebra. Before we discuss the
results arisen from such treatment, let's have a quick review
on several characteristics of matrices, including determi-
nants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, and their geometric
meanings on a three-dimensional coordinate system.
A Review on Useful Techniques in
Linear Algebra
Introduction to Determinants
In linear algebra, a determinant is a value associated with a
square matrix, normally denoted by det(A) where A is the
square matrix. It is an important parameter if the matrix is
used to present the coefficients of a system of simultaneous
linear equations or if the matrix corresponds to a linear trans-
formation of a vector space. A geometric interpretation can
be given to the determinant of a square matrix with real
entries. The absolute value of the determinant gives the scale
factor by which area or volume (or a higher dimensional ana-
logue) is multiplied under the associated linear transforma-
tion while its sign indicates whether the transformation
preserves orientation. It is given by the following equation.

Introduction to Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
The eigenvectors and eigenvalues were developed by Cauchy
(a French mathematician) in his study in quadratic form in
1826. He found that an eigenvalue problem had resulted
from solving a quadratic problem. The eigenvectors and
eigenvalues have been widely adopted in engineering prob-
lems. It has been adopted in the design of power system
(Fereidouni, Vahidi, Mehr, & Tahmasbi, 2013), structural

engineering (Kong & Huang, 2013), medical imaging
(Hyvonen, Nandakumaran, Varma, & Vasu, 2013), fluid
mechanics (Pochyly, Malenovsky, & Pohanka, 2013), and so
forth. The eigenvectors of a square matrix have the property
that multiplying the square matrix to its eigenvectors is
equivalent to applying multiples to the eigenvectors. These
multiples are called eigenvalues.
It can be mathematically described by the equation
Av v
=  , where A is the square matrix, v is the eigenvector,
and  is the eigenvalue, which is in fact the multiple to the
eigenvector. To obtain the eigenvector of A, the above equation
can be written as A I v 0
-
( ) =
 . If the eigenvector is nonzero,
we must have det .
A I
-
( ) =
 0 By solving this equation, the
values of  representing the eigenvalues can then be obtained,
from which the corresponding eigenvectors can also be com-
puted by putting the values of  back into A I v 0
-
( ) =
 .
Readers may refer to any standard textbook on linear algebra
for the detailed study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Geometrical Interpretation of Eigenvectors and
Eigenvalues
The eigenvectors and eigenvalues have been widely used in
principal component analysis (Jolliffe, 2002). We consider a
3-by-3 matrix as the covariance matrix of a set of data scat-
tering in the three-dimensional (3D) space. It should be noted
that the covariance matrix must be a symmetric matrix. This
approach uses a 3D ellipse to fit the distribution of such data
in the 3D space. The three principal axes of the ellipse are in
fact the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The square
root of an eigenvalue represents the spread in the direction of
the corresponding eigenvector. The geometrical meanings of
the following three symmetric matrices are discussed.

Matrix (a) is a diagonal matrix of which all diagonal ele-
ments are identical. It means that the spreads of the data
along the axes of the Cartesian coordination system are the
same. Therefore, the geometry of the data spread estimated
by the eigenvalue analysis is represented by a 3D sphere.
Matrix (b) is also a diagonal matrix, but the elements on the
diagonal of the matrix are not the same. It means that the data
spread along different axes of the Cartesian coordination sys-
tem are different. Therefore, the geometry of the data spread
is represented by a 3D ellipse, but the axes of the ellipse are
parallel to the axes of the Cartesian coordination system.
Matrix (c) is similar to matrix (b) but some of the off-
diagonal elements are nonzero. However, the matrix is still
symmetric on both sides of the diagonal. The geometry of the
data spread is still a 3D ellipse, but the three principal axes of
the ellipse are no longer parallel to the axes of the Cartesian
coordination system.
The origin of the three principal axes coincides with the
origin of the coordination system but rotated around a pivot at
the origin. The above geometrical interpretation from the
eigenvectors and eigenvalues are restricted to a symmetric
matrix only. However, the eigenvalues are not necessarily
real. Sometimes, we may obtain imaginary eigenvalues as the
roots of the equation det A I
-
( ) =
 0 are not necessarily
real.
In a 3D space, the three roots (i.e., the eigenvalues of the
matrix) are either all real numbers or one real number with
two imaginary numbers, which are conjugate to each other.
The eigenvectors can still be obtained from the eigenvalues
although two of the eigenvalues may be imaginary numbers.
By taking the dot product of any two eigenvectors, the result
is not necessary to be zero. It indicates that the three princi-
pal axes are not necessary to be orthogonal to each other.
Although the geometrical interpretation of the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues with imaginary number(s) is not easy to
interpret, obtaining the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the
matrices (i.e., the standard charts) may possibly form a basis
from a mathematical perspective to analyze the relations
between the charts.
Mathematical Basis of 36 Luo Shu
Variations
Generating 17 Standard Charts From One Luo
Shu's Original Chart
By revisiting Table 1, the 17 standard charts could easily be
generated from the original Luo Shu in two simple equa-
tions. This was also mentioned in Ho's (2003) book in
plain text. One basic technique adopted by the famous
Greek philosopher, Pythagoras, has to be used here. He
reduced all higher numbers to the original 10 numerals by
successively adding the digits together until a single digit
was reached. Let's build a function, Py(x or X) here to
memorize him, x being an integer and X being a matrix
where the function applies to every element within. As an
example, the number 144,000 mentioned in Revelation
14:3 was reduced by some scholars to the number,
Py(144,000) = 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9. And according to
Pythagoreans, the number "9" refers to mankind. Let's rep-
resent any standard chart by the symbol, FS(x+) or FS(y­).
Here, FS, a function to create a matrix, means Flying Stars;
x and y are the integers placed at the central palace; + or
- means whether the flying trajectory is either forward or
backward, respectively.

Determinant of the 36 Standard Charts
As discussed in the section "A Review on Useful Techniques
in Linear Algebra" of this article, the determinant of a matrix
has a very important meaning related to the behavior of the
matrix. The determinants of the 36 standard charts are shown
in Table 2. The following symbols are valid.

It can be seen that the determinants of all FS without rota-
tion but with 1, 4, or 7 at the central palace are identical to
each other. That applies to other FS with 2, 5, or 8 and then
3, 6, or 9. The equivalence is also extensible to the two FS
with rotations, if the negative sign is ignored.
One more observation is that the result is constantly equal
to "9" when the function Py is applied to the absolute value
of the determinant of any FS. That reminds us of the discus-
sionon"TheThreeBigTrigrams"inthesection"Applications
of Luo Shu and Its Extended Charts in the Compass School,"
the Pythagorean number "9", and the implication of the fig-
ure "144,000" in the Bible. Perhaps the evaluation of deter-
minants could help to strengthen the currently most popular
theory of "The Three Big Trigrams," which should be "1-4-
7," "2-5-8," and "3-6-9."
To show that such equivalence is not generic with any
matrix similar to FS, every matrix of the first row in Table 2
is rotated merely by 45, which has not been used in any
school of Chinese metaphysics, and the determinant of each
matrix is calculated, as shown in Table 3.
Table 3 is for reference only, showing that the equivalent
and elegant values of determinants of the 36 standard Charts
do not seem to be coincident or by luck because the proper-
ties of "1-4-7," "2-5-8," "3-6-9," and "Py = 9" all disap-
peared in Table 3.
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
We would like to propose a hypothesis here. Suppose the
matrices of the standard charts represent a geometrical space
of independent vectors and coordinates, then, the eigenval-
ues and eigenvectors of all these matrices may give us some
hints. As the numbers in the 36 standard charts are not sym-
metrical, a simple conversion is proposed here. All numbers
are subtracted by "5." In other words, the original system of
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} now becomes {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2,
3, 4}. It looks more symmetrical here. However, we do not
mean that by doing so, the matrices will become symmetrical
by themselves. After all, the numbers have long been called
stars and that may mean Feng Shui masters have been treating

Table 4 shows the determinants, eigenvectors, and eigen-
values of FS(x+,0)­5; Table 5 shows the determinants, eigen-
vectors, and eigenvalues of FS(x­,0)­5; Table 6 shows the
determinants, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues of FS(x+,90)­5,
that is, forward flying but rotated clockwise. Table 7
shows the determinants, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues
of FS(x+,270)­5, that is, forward flying but rotated
anticlockwise. Most eigenvalues and eigenvectors are complex
numbers with a real part, Re, and an imaginary part, Img.
First of all, determinants are checked. It can be seen that
in all four tables, there are just three values of determinants,
much simpler than before, that is, -54, 0, and 54. Except 0,
the Py of the other two, when taken absolute, is also equal to
9. The "1-4-7," "2-5-8," and "3-6-9" equivalence is also pre-
served in and across all four tables, regarding the determi-
nants, from Tables 4 to 7.
Regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, there are
several observations.
i. In all four tables, there is an extremely high level of
similarity between these two parameters of eigenval-
ues and eigenvectors, corresponding to the following
pairs, FS(1)-FS(9), FS(2)-FS(8), FS(3)-FS(7), and
FS(4)-FS(6), within the same table. Here, the angle
of rotation and (-5) are ignored for simplicity of
explanation. Although they are not 100% identical,
the magnitudes of the eigenvectors of these pairs are
identical, the difference being the direction only, pos-
itive or negative. Readers could double check the real

similarity equally applies to "1-9," "2-8," and "3-7"
across Tables 4 and 5 as well. Furthermore, it can be
seen that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
FS(5+,0)-5 and FS(5-,0)-5 are 100% identical to
one another.
iii. By comparing Tables 6 and 7, it can be seen that the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of FS(5+,90)-5,
FS(5+,270)-5 are similar to FS(2+,90)-5,
FS(8+,90)-5, FS(2+,270)-5, FS(8+,270)-5. It
seems that "The Three Big Trigrams" theory comes
in here.
iv. Furthermore, besides the "2-5-8" similarity across
Tables 6 and 7, a more extensive similarity with all
"1-3-4-6-7-9" exists within and across the two tables.
v. Just for the purpose of illustration, the determinants,
eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of nine matrices, still
with -4 to +4 at the central palace but other eight
numbers randomly placed, are shown in Table 8. As
expected, all those behaviors of similarity disappear.
That once again demonstrates that the 18 to 36 stan-
dard charts of Luo Shu were not arbitrarily created or
produced by luck.
Conclusion
In this article, the importance and history of Luo Shu have
been briefly reviewed, with an introduction to two methods
within the Compass School of Feng Shui that heavily rely on
the operation of 18 or up to 36 variations of the Luo Shu. Then,
it is hypothesized that Luo Shu, as a magic square, could be
viewed as a 3 × 3 matrix, and such matrix could be further
extended to 18 or 36 variations. The significance of two types
of variations possessing patterns, including "The Three Big
Trigrams" and "Combined to Ten" was also highlighted.
Observations on similarity between different charts in terms of
determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors have been con-
firmed and discovered. Such similarity may find its roots in
ancient literature on the Compass School of Feng Shui. The
authors are not certain how ancient Chinese knew about that as
they would not have any knowledge on modern algebra.
The extremely high level of similarity between Tables 6 and
7 may explain why only 18 standard charts are popularly used
in contemporary Flying Stars Method while the remaining 18
are only used in some limited schools of Qi Men Dun Jia
Method. In fact, most modern Qi Men Dun Jia schools only

focus on the first 18 standard charts. That may be due to the
high degree of dependence between the additional 18 standard
charts, resulting in a lower degree of freedom for applications.
One more simple and final observation is that all nine
"backward flying" charts could be generated by the nine
"forward flying" charts merely by rotation and vice versa.
The general formulae are shown below.

Having recalled that the 36 standard charts were devel-
oped long time ago, it should not be something created just by
luck or by chance. The main contribution of this article is to
establish the mathematical basis of studying Luo Shu and its
variations. With the use of the language of modern mathemat-
ics, the research of this area of ancient Chinese philosophy
and metaphysics could be more conscientious and scientific.

Author Biographies
Albert Ting Pat So, PhD, is an electrical engineer and professor by
profession and began to study Feng Shui some twenty years ago.
Jointly with Michael Mak, he had organized a series of international
Feng Shui conferences in Hong Kong, and published three books on
scientific Feng Shui and the built environment. He founded WISE
(HK Branch) with Eric Lee and others, and Science Academy of
Chinese Culture in Hong Kong with Diskson Leung and Kin Li to
conduct cutting edge research in Feng Shui and other scientific
anomalies.
Eric Lee, PhD, is a building services engineer and professor by
profession. He has been an active founding member of the World
Institute for Scientific Exploration (Hong Kong Branch), studying
various disciplines of metaphysics with the help of modern mathe-
matics and artificial intelligence.
Kin Lun Li has been a Feng Shui master for half a century, who
adopted some esoteric knowledge on Feng Shui, in particular in the
discipline of Qi Men Dun Jia, from masters in his home village in
China. He is a regular writer of various famous magazines in Hong
Kong, contributing articles on predicting political and economic
conditions based on Qi Men Dun Jia. He is a founding member of
Science Academy of Chinese Culture.
Dickson Koon Sing Leung, BA, has been studying ancient Chinese
metaphysics, including Feng Shui and fate calculation etc. since he
was an undergraduate with the University of Hong Kong when he
was a student of the late Prof. P.Y. Ho. His late grandfather and
father were also famous Feng Shui masters in his home village in
China. He is the principal founding member of Science Academy of
Chinese Culture in Hong Kong.
