Introduction
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is an increasing problem
worldwide, and it is a major health problem, associated with
very high morbidity and mortality.1 Renal transplantation is
the best renal replacement therapy option and is superior to
dialysis in patients with ESRD.2 The specialty of kidney
transplantation has made dramatic strides over the decades,
evolving from an experimental procedure to the standard care
for the treatment of patients with ESRD.3 However, renal
allograft survival after renal transplantation is most important
for the patients with ESRD, and is an important indicator to
reflect the development of organ transplantation.
In the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene,
nearly 100 gene polymorphisms have been identified.4
Among them, the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) gene
polymorphism is found to be more frequently associated
with renal allograft survival after renal transplantation.

Abstract
Background and objective: The relationship between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion
(I/D) gene polymorphism and renal allograft survival after renal transplantation from the published reports are still
debatable. This study was performed to evaluate the relationship between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal
allograft survival after renal transplantation using meta-analysis.
Method: Eligible studies were identified from PubMed and Cochrane Library on 1 November 2014, and eligible studies
were recruited and synthesized using a meta-analysis methodology.
Results: Twelve investigations were included in this meta-analysis for the assessment of the relationship between the
ACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal allograft survival. In this meta-analysis, the ACE I/D gene polymorphism was
not associated with renal allograft survival after renal transplantation for overall populations, Caucasians, Brazilians
and Africans. Interestingly, the ACE D allele and DD genotype were associated with renal allograft survival after renal
transplantation in the Asian population.
Conclusions: ACE D allele and DD genotype were associated with renal allograft survival after renal transplantation in
the Asian population. However, more studies should be performed to confirm this association.

In past years, several studies have been performed and
have found that the ACE I/D gene polymorphism
is associated with several renal diseases.5­10 A well-
documented diagnostic approach to predict renal allo-
graft survival after renal transplantation is lacking.
Current evidence indicates that gene polymorphism of
some genes is associated with renal allograft survival
after renal transplantation.
The gene polymorphism factor is reported to be an
important factor associated with renal allograft survival
after renal transplantation. Most of the epidemiologic
investigations studying the relationship between the
ACE I/D gene polymorphism and the renal allograft sur-
vival after renal transplantation were conducted in recent
decades. However, the available evidence is weak, due
to the sparseness of data or disagreements among the
reported studies. The evidence from meta-analysis might
be powerful compared with the individual investigation.
We performed this meta-analysis to investigate whether
the ACE I/D gene polymorphism is associated with renal
allograft survival after renal transplantation.
Materials and methods
Search strategy for the assessment of
the relationship between ACE I/D gene
polymorphism and renal allograft survival
The relevant studies were searched from the electronic
databases of PubMed, and Cochrane Library on 1
November 2014. The retrieval strategy of `(renal allograft
survival) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme) AND
(polymorphism OR variant)' was entered into these data-
bases. The additional reports were identified through refer-
ences cited in recruited articles.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria
(1) The outcome had to be renal allograft survival.
(2) There had to be at least two comparison groups
(case group vs control group).
(3) Investigation should provide the data of the ACE
I/D genotype distribution.
Exclusion criteria
(1) Review articles and editorials.
(2) Case reports.
(3) Preliminary result not on the ACE I/D gene poly-
morphism or outcome.
(4) Investigating the role of ACE I/D gene expression
in disease.
(5) If multiple publications for the same data from the
same study group occurred, we only recruited the
later paper into our final analysis.
Data extraction and synthesis
The following information from each eligible investiga-
tion was extracted independently by two investigators:
first author's surname, year of publication, location of the
study performed, control source of the control group and
the number of cases and controls for ACE I/D genotypes.
The results were compared and disagreement was resolved
by discussion.
Statistical analysis
Cochrane Review Manager Version 5 (Cochrane Library,
UK) was used to calculate the available data from each
investigation. The pooled statistics were counted using
the fixed effects model, but a random effects model was
conducted when the P value of heterogeneity test was less
than 0.1.8,11 Results were expressed with odds ratios (OR)
for dichotomous data, and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were also calculated. P<0.05 was required for the pooled
OR to be statistically significant.12,13 I2 was used to test
the heterogeneity between the included studies.
Results
Study characteristics
Twelve investigations14­25 reporting the relationship
between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal allo-
graft survival were recruited into this meta-analysis
(Table 1). The data of our interest were extracted for the
meta-analysis (Table 1).
Association of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism
with renal allograft survival
In this meta-analysis, we found that the ACE D allele, DD
genotype and II genotype were not associated with renal
allograft survival (D allele: OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.90­1.24,
P=0.49; DD genotype: OR=1.12, 95% CI: 0.78­1.61,
P=0.53; II genotype: OR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.68­1.18,
P=0.45; Figure 1 and Table 2).
In the Caucasian population, the D allele, DD genotype
and II genotype were also not associated with renal allo-
graft survival (D allele: OR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.74­1.18,
P=0.56; DD genotype: OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.55­1.14,
P=0.21; II genotype: OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.61­1.40,
P=0.71; Table 2 and Figure 2).
Interestingly, the D allele, and DD genotype were found
to be associated with renal allograft survival in the Asian
population, but this association was not found for the II
genotype (D allele: OR=1.61, 95% CI: 1.07­2.42, P=0.02;
DD genotype: OR=4.03, 95% CI: 1.91­8.51, P=0.0003; II
genotype: OR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.47­1.78, P=0.80; Table 2
and Figure 3).

Discussion
In recent decades there have been some studies reporting
that the ACE I/D gene polymorphism is associated with
renal allograft survival. Misra et al.26 conducted a study to
investigatetherelationshipbetweencytotoxicT-lymphocyte
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) gene polymorphism and renal allograft
outcome, and reported that CTLA-4 variance was involved
in susceptibility to acute allograft rejection. Kloda et al.27
performed a study enrolling 269 Caucasian renal transplant
recipients who remained under observation for 5 years, and
reported that the rs5498 intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1) GG genotype was correlated with early and long-
term allograft failure, and the C allele of the rs1041163
VCAM1 gene was associated with long-term allograft fail-
ure and graft loss, as well as increased morbidity after trans-
plantation. Vu et al.28 reported that the -1195C>T in the
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) promoter and allograft inflam-
matory factor-1 (AIF-1) could be potential predictors of allo-
graft rejection in Hispanic kidney transplant recipients.
In this meta-analysis, we found that the ACE I/D gene
polymorphism was not associated with renal allograft
survival in overall populations. There were 12 included stud-
ies for this meta-analysis. There might be no association
between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal allograft
survival in the overall population, although more eligible
studies should be conducted in the future to confirm it.
Furthermore, there was also no association between the ACE
I/D gene polymorphism and renal allograft survival in
Caucasian, Brazilian or African populations. However, the
number of included studies for the Brazilian andAfrican pop-
ulations was small, and more studies should be conducted to
explore this relationship. Interestingly, the ACE D allele and
DD genotype were associated with renal allograft survival in
the Asian population, and there was no notable heterogeneity
among the included studies, and a fixed effects model was
conducted to calculate the pooled OR. However, the number
of included studies for the Asian population was small. More
studies for the association between ACE I/D gene polymor-
phism and renal allograft survival in the Asian population
should be performed in the future.
This meta-analysis was the first to study the relation-
ship between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and renal
allograft survival after renal transplantation. This investi-
gation included 12 studies using meta-analysis and
reported that the ACE D allele and DD genotype might
become valuable indicators to predict renal allograft sur-
vival in Asian populations. However, those results should

be regarded cautiously for several reasons, for example,
small sample size of the included report, heterogeneity of
enrolled cases, limited statistical power, variable study
designs and different interventions.
To sum up, the ACE D allele and DD genotype might
become valuable indicators to predict renal allograft sur-
vival in Asian populations. However, more studies are
needed to confirm this.
