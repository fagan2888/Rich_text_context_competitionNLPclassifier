Effects of Eye Images and Norm Cues on
Charitable Donation: A Field Experiment
in an Izakaya
Ryo Oda1 and Ryota Ichihashi2
Abstract
Laboratory and field experiments have shown that people are more likely to be prosocial in the presence of watching eyes images.
This ``watching eyes effect'' may be explained by the reputation-based partner choice model or a norm-compliance model sug-
gesting that eye images elicit conformity to locally specific behavioral norms. A previous laboratory study that investigated the
effects of local norms on charitable donations by using watching eye images and manipulating money visible in a collection box
found that the presence of eye images significantly increased overall donations; however, the images did not make people more
likely to conform to the apparent local norm. Here, we report the results of a field study examining the effects of watching eyes
and the amount of money in transparent collection boxes on charitable giving in an izakaya (a Japanese-style tavern) setting.
Contrary to the previous study, we found that the amount donated increased more under the large- than the small-norm
treatment. The presence of eye images increased the overall amount donated but was more salient under the small-norm
treatment. We found that participants were more likely to increase the amount of money in the box than to conform to the
local norm of a small donation when the eye images were present. The results of this study suggest that an appropriate com-
bination of eye images and normative information can alter people's behavior without changing their economic incentives.

Growing evidence from laboratory and field studies suggests
that the presence of eye images increases prosocial behavior
toward unrelated strangers, a phenomenon known as the
``watching eyes effect.'' Since the pioneering work of Haley
and Fessler (2005) and Burnham and Hare (2007), several
laboratory experiments have confirmed the observation that
individuals are more generous in economic games when the
presence of artificial eyes suggest that they are being watched
(e.g., Baillon, Selim, & van Dolder, 2013; Keller & Pfatthei-
cher, 2011; Mifune, Hashimito, & Yamagishi, 2010; Oda,
Niwa, Honma, & Hiraishi, 2011; Rigdon, Ishii, Watabe, &
Kitayama, 2009; see Nettle et al., 2013, and Sparks & Barcley,
2013, for reviews). Previous field experiments have shown that
watching eyes induce prosocial behavior in real-life situations.
In the presence of eye images, people are more likely to pay via
an honesty box (Bateson, Nettle, & Roberts, 2006), refrain
from littering (Ernest-Jones, Nettle, & Bateson, 2011), recycle
appropriately (Francey & Bergmu
¨ller, 2012), and make
charitable donations (Ekstro
¨m, 2011; Powell, Roberts, &
Nettle, 2012).
The watching eyes effect may be explained by the
``reputation-based partner choice'' model or a norm-
compliance model, suggesting that eye images elicited confor-
mity to locally specific behavioral norms. Theoretical models
and empirical studies have shown that prosocial behavior
toward unrelated strangers has evolved through reputation-

based partner choices (e.g., Barclay & Willer, 2007; Bereczkei,
Birkas, & Kerekes, 2010; Roberts, 1998), which predicts that
generosity in the presence of watching eyes is based on the
providers' expectation of a future reward. Alternatively, altru-
ism is a social norm, and humans tend to conform to social
norms and to sanction departures from these norms (Chudek &
Henrich, 2011). Thus, eye images may promote conformity by
increasing awareness of the presence of others.
The findings of several previous studies support the
reputation-based partner choice model. In a field study that
involved manipulating the amount of litter, Bateson, Callow,
Holmes, Redmond Roche, and Nettle (2013) found that images
of watching eyes posted on nearby bicycle racks did not facil-
itate norm compliance. Fathi, Bateson, and Nettle (2014) con-
ducted an experimental study in which participants were
invited to donate money earned in a previous task to a charity
and observed the amount donated under conditions of large and
small amounts of money already present in the transparent
donation jars in the presence and absence of watching eyes
images on the walls. The authors found that the local norm did
not affect overall donations and that, although the presence of
eye images significantly increased overall donations, watching
eyes did not make people more likely to conform to the appar-
ent local norm. Oda, Niwa, Honma, and Hiraishi (2011) inves-
tigated this issue through the participants' interpretations of the
situation. They conducted the dictator game in the presence and
absence of a painting of stylized eyes. The participants were
asked to complete a postexperimental questionnaire designed
to determine what they were thinking when they decided on the
amount of money to offer the recipient and how they perceived
the experimental situation. The results suggested that the
watching eyes effect was mediated by the expectation of a
reward rather than by the fear of punishment. The results of
these studies appear to support the reputation-based partner
choice model. Nevertheless, support also exists for the norm-
compliance model. Oda, Kato, and Hiraishi (2015) compared
the tendency to tell a ``prosocial lie'' in the presence and
absence of stylized eyes. Contrary to previous studies, they
found that prosocial behavior and norm compliance contra-
dicted each other. Participants tended to tell lies that benefited
others when eye images were not present, whereas the tendency
toward prosocial lying disappeared in the presence of the sty-
lized eyes, suggesting that the desire to avoid violating norms
by being honest was stronger than the desire to pursue a good
reputation by demonstrating generosity. Further studies of the
watching eyes effect in various settings are needed to settle this
issue. Moreover, several studies have found no effect of eye
images on behavior (e.g., Fehr & Schneider, 2010; Raihani &
Bshary, 2012; Tane & Takezawa, 2011; Matsugasaki, Tsuka-
moto, & Ohtsubo, 2015). Thus, replication studies are needed
to investigate the robustness of the watching eyes effect.
Here, we report the results of a field study examining the
effects of watching eyes and the amount of money in transpar-
ent collection boxes on charitable giving in an izakaya (a
Japanese-style tavern) setting. Our aim was to replicate the
findings of Fathi et al. (2014) with high ecological validity.
Based on the findings of Ekstro
¨m (2011), Powell et al.
(2012), and Fathi et al. (2014), we predicted that the presence
of watching eyes would increase charitable donations,
whereas the prosocial norm would not affect the amount
donated.
Materials and Method
Study Location
The study was conducted in an izakaya, a Japanese-style
tavern, located near a terminal station in Nagoya, Japan. The
izakaya contained 12 low tables, each of which sat 4 people, 3
low tables that sat 6, and a counter for 17 people.
Materials
We used three ready-made transparent collection boxes with a
money slot (Plasart, Inc.; 120 Â 97 Â 179 mm, W Â D Â H;
Figure 1). Cardholders were mounted on the front and back of
the boxes. We inserted a blue card (100 Â 65 mm, W Â H) on
the front of the box indicating that the donation would be sent
to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) to aid refugees. On the back, we inserted a white
card (100 Â 170 mm, W Â H) with a brief written explanation
of the refugee crisis and the watching eyes stimulus image
(50 Â 30 mm, W Â H) in the upper portion. The eyes treatment
stimulus employed the same stylized eyes image as used by
Haley and Fessler (2005). The control treatment stimulus was a
reconstructed version of the same image, in which the eyes
were not identifiable (Figure 1). Under the small-norm treat-
ment, we placed 150 coins in the box including ¥1, ¥10, ¥50,
and ¥100, amounting to a total value of 4,050 Japanese yen
(JPY). Under the large-norm treatment, the box contained 149
coins including ¥1, ¥10, ¥50, ¥100, and ¥500 and a ¥1,000
banknote amounting to a total value of 15,930 JPY (Table 1).

Procedure
The collection boxes were placed in three locations around the
izakaya: on the checkout counter, near the entrance to a room
with 11 low tables, and on a low table in a private dining room
for six. The boxes were left in place for 84 days between
November 1, 2015, and February 19, 2016. One of the four
combinations of the eyes/control and small-/large-norm treat-
ments was randomly allocated to each day during the study
period; thus, each combination was tested for a total of 21 days.
The izakaya was open between 5:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. The
collection boxes were emptied by an author or an izakaya staff
member each day during the experimental period after the
izakaya closed, and the amount donated was counted. The staff
provided the number of patrons and groups who visited the
izakaya on each experimental day.
Data Analysis
The R statistical software package (R Core Development
Team, 2011) was used to conduct the statistical tests. The dis-
tribution was highly skewed to the right because most individ-
uals donated a small amount of money, and large donations
were rare; thus, the dependent variable was modeled using the
Poisson distribution. A general linear model was used to ana-
lyze the effects of the predictor variables of eyes, norm, and
their interaction on the dependent variable (amount donated).
Results
Donations by Treatment
Donations were made on 74 of the 84 experimental days. Of the
10 days during which no money was donated, 7 were small-
norm/no-eyes condition days, and each of the other conditions
was represented on 1 no donation day, that is, 1 day was the
small-norm/with-eyes condition, 1 was the large-norm/no-eyes,
and 1 was the large-norm/with-eyes condition. The difference
was statistically significant (w2 ¼ 10.80, df ¼ 3, p ¼ .012). The
total amount donated was 10,174 JPY, and the median amount
donated per day was 90 JPY (range: 0­530). A total of 8,269
patrons visited the izakaya during the experiment, and the
median number of patrons per day was 92.5 (range: 46­176).
A Poisson regression model was fitted using the number of
patrons who visited the izakaya each day as an offset term
(Akaike information criterion [AIC] ¼ 4,866.2) because it was
correlated with the amount donated (Kendall t ¼ .61, z ¼ 8.07,
p < .001). The main effects of watching eyes and norm were
significant (eyes: B ¼ .132, SE ¼ .034, z ¼ 3.936, p < .001;
norm: B ¼ .554, SE ¼ .030, z ¼ 18.417, p <.001), but the
interaction between eyes and norm was not significant
(B ¼ À.041, SE ¼ .042, z ¼ À.986, p ¼ .324). More money
was donated under the large-norm than under the small-norm
treatment. Furthermore, the presence of watching eyes
increased the overall amount donated.
The largest donation in a day was 530 JPY, which was made
under the large-norm/no-eyes condition. We considered this
donation an outlier and excluded it from the following analyses
because the amount was 1.5 times the interquartile range (202.1
JPY) above the third quartile (178.5 JPY). A total of 8,189
patrons visited the izakaya during the remaining 83 experimen-
tal days, and the median number of patrons per day was 93
(range: 46­176). The total amount donated was 9,644 JPY.
Table 2 shows the amount donated and number of patrons
according to condition.
A Poisson regression model was fitted using the number of
patrons who visited the izakaya each day as an offset term (AIC
¼ 4,027.4) because it was correlated with the amount donated
(Kendall t¼.63, z ¼ 8.31, p < .001). The main effects of
watching eyes and norm were significant (eyes: B ¼ .132,
SE ¼ .034, z ¼ 3.936, p < .001; norm: B ¼ .414, SE ¼ .031,
z ¼ 13.328, p < .001) as was the interaction between eyes and
norm (B ¼ .099, SE ¼ .042, z ¼ 2.343, p ¼ .019). More money
was donated under the large-norm than under the small-norm
treatment. Furthermore, the presence of watching eyes
increased the overall amount donated; however, the effect of
the eye images was more salient under the small-norm than
under the large-norm treatment (Figure 2).
We quantified the frequency of coin denominations donated
under each condition to determine the effects of watching eyes,
norm, and the norm/eyes interaction on individual donations
(Table 2). We found no significant difference in coin denomi-
nations across conditions (w2 ¼ 16.25, df ¼ 12, p ¼ .180).
Changes in Donations by Treatment
To estimate the effects of patrons' consciousness of the reci-
pients and their habituation to the experimental treatments, we
plotted the amount donated per patron each day (Figure 3). The
amount donated in the small-norm/no-eyes condition tended to
decrease as the days passed (Figure 3a; Kendall t ¼ À.43,
z ¼ À2.62, p ¼ .008). However, no significant decrease in the
amount donated was detected under the other three conditions
(Figure 3b­d; Kendall t ¼ .25, .16, and .16, respectively).
Discussion
We found that both the prosocial norm and watching eyes
affected charitable donations and that the effect of the norm
was stronger than that of watching eyes. No decrease in the
amount donated was detected as a function of days elapsed
under the large-norm or with-eyes treatments. Although we
have no data on the regularity of the patrons, the results suggest

that few patrons visited the izakaya on a regular basis and that
no patron, even among the few regulars, habituated to the sti-
mulus. However, the amount donated decreased as a function
of days elapsed under the small-norm/no-eyes treatment. This
could reflect trends in the news coverage of the refugee crisis.
According to Google Trends, the search volume index for the
word ``nanmin'' (``refugee'' in Japanese) was at its peak (100)
in September 2015, and it then decreased to 32 in November
2015, when we started the experiments. The index values in
December, January, February, and March were 22, 31, 19, and
17, respectively. That is, consciousness of the refugee crisis
tended to decrease in Japan during the study period. The transi-
tion analysis suggested that the decrease in donations later in
the period was probably caused by the lack of concern about
the refugee crisis, which was prevented by the large-norm or
eye-stimulus treatments and led to differences in total dona-
tions among conditions.
Our finding that the presence of eye images increased the
overall amount donated supports those of Ekstro
¨m (2011),
Powell et al. (2012), and Fathi et al. (2014). The watching eyes
effect was more salient under the small-donation treatment
after excluding an outlier. The interaction between the eyes
and norm treatments was not significant when we included a
day in which an extreme donation was made, which raises
questions on the robustness of the interaction effect. However,
similar to Nettle et al. (2013), we found that the watching eyes
effect appeared to be driven by a change in the probability of
giving anything at all (7 days with no donations under the
control treatment vs. 1 day under the eyes treatment) under the
small-norm treatment, whereas no such tendency was observed
under the large-norm treatment (1 day with no donations under
each eye treatment). In any case, the eye image did not boost
conformity to local norms, which supports the reputation-based
partner choice model.
Contrary to the findings of Fathi et al. (2014), the partici-
pants in our study donated more money under the large-norm
than under the small-norm treatment, which supports the find-
ings of Martin and Randall (2008, 2009). Fathi et al. (2014)
reported that the median donation under the large-norm/no-
eyes treatment was zero and suggested that this was caused
by a relative excess of zero donations, suggesting that the norm
cues provided an indication of an acceptable minimum level of
prosociality. However, no donations were seen during only
2 days under the large-norm treatment of our experiments.
Several differences between these studies may account for the
disparity. First, the study settings differed: Ours was conducted
in the field, whereas that of Fathi et al. was a laboratory study.
Second, differences in the manipulation of money in the col-
lection boxes may have significantly affected local norms; for
instance, the norm cues in our experiment may have been
stronger than those used by Fathi et al. In the Fathi et al. study,
the amount of money in the large-norm jar was about twice as
much as that in the small-norm jar, whereas in our study, the
large-norm collection box contained approximately 4 times
more money than the small-norm box. Moreover, our large-
norm boxes contained banknotes. Third, cultural differences
may have contributed to the disparity between studies.
Fathi et al. recruited participants from a volunteer database
held by a university in England, whereas our subjects were
patrons of a Japanese izakaya. Japanese individuals are
more likely than Westerners to conform to norms. Studies of the
culturally construed self suggest that the East Asian cultures
adhere to the fundamental relatedness of individuals to one
another (interdependent self), whereas European and American
individuals seek to maintain their independence from others
(independent self; e.g., Markus & Kitayama, 1991).
Furthermore, the money to be donated was provided by the
experimenter as payment for the completion of a task in the
Fathi et al. (2014) study, whereas our subjects were required to

donate their own money. Participants in the Fathi et al. study
were told that their donations went to a local organization that
provided air ambulance services in the North of England,
which could be classified as an ``in-group.'' Conversely, our
participants were told that the donations were for refugees,
which could be classified as an ``out-group.'' Furthermore, the
watching eyes stimulus used by Fathi et al. was an image of
male eyes, whereas our stimulus image was Horus eyes.
Finally, alcohol intoxication may have affected behavior in
our study because most of the patrons consumed alcoholic
beverages during the evening. Any one of these factors alone
or interactions among them may account for the differences
observed between our findings and those of Fathi et al. Fur-
ther studies that control for each confounding factor are
needed for clarification.
Although the proportions of ¥50 and ¥100 coins were larger
under the large-norm treatment than under the small-norm treat-
ment, no significant difference in the type of coin denominations
was observed among the conditions. Moreover, the total number
of coins was larger under the large-norm treatment than under
the small-norm treatment. These results suggest that the larger
amount of money donated under the large-norm treatment was
not due to large individual donations. It is likely that differences
in the amount donated among the four conditions resulted from
differences in the total number of coins donated. This finding
suggests that the large amount of money in the large-norm box
served to draw more attention to the written information about
UNHCR activities than did the small amount of money. Indeed,
we included a banknote in the large-norm box, which is unusual
in charity boxes. Similarly, it may be that the presence of eye
images drew attention to the collection box, as Ernest-Jones et al.
(2011) suggested. Alternatively, it is possible that although the
frequency of coin throwing did not differ between the large- and
small-norm treatments, people who saw a large amount of
money in the boxes donated more coins at a time to conform
to the norm, leading to the same result. The use of a video
camera to confirm the number of donations made under each
condition, similar to that used by Martin and Randall (2008),
would help clarify this issue.
In conclusion, both an eye image and normative information
facilitated prosociality, and there may be some interaction
between these factors. The results of this study suggest that
an appropriate combination of eye images and normative infor-
mation can alter people's behavior without changing their eco-
nomic incentives.
