Whereas an early scholarly generation theorized that each
president's fate hinged on his personal character and politi-
cal acumen (Barber, 1972; Burns, 1965; Corwin, 1957;
Rossiter, 1956), today's researchers tend to deemphasize
what Fred Greenstein (2004) called "the presidential dif-
ference." This transformation reflects numerous studies
showing institutional rules, historical context, and partisan
allegiances mute presidents' discretion and impact--with
citizens (e.g. Canes-Wrone, 2005; Edwards, 2003; Wood,
2009), reporters (e.g. Kumar, 2007), lawmakers (Bond and
Fleisher, 1990; Lee, 2009), not to mention the political
system writ large (e.g. Edwards, 2009; Jones, 1994;
Skowronek, 1993). In the scholarly parlance, then, "presi-
dency-centered" theories of presidential behavior have
largely supplanted "president-centered" ones.
One lingering question, however, is whether presidents'
personal preferences matter more inside the West Wing.
For internal operations are not only a domain where presi-
dents' discretion is relatively broad, but it is also one where
systematic evidence is relatively thin.
On one hand, there is good reason to believe the institu-
tional presidency disciplines individual presidents. Careful
research has shown consistency in the White House's inter-
nal organization, at least since Richard Nixon ran things
(Ponder, 2000; Rudalevige, 2002; Walcott and Hult, 1995,
2005). It was Richard Nixon who insisted issues and advi-
sors reach the president per a rigid protocol, following a
clear chain-of-command, led by the president, managed by
a Chief of Staff, channeled through a cadre of advisors, and
informed by a vast array of domain-specific experts (see
especially Nathan, 1975; Reeves, 2002; Walcott and Hult,
1995, 2005). Charles Walcott and Karen Hult (2005) thus
conclude Mr Nixon forged "the standard model" for organ-
izing the modern presidency--a "model" that has endured
year-to-year, president-to-president--which buttresses
William Howell and Terry Moe's recent appraisal: "All
presidents share basically the same wiring, and they can be
counted upon to behave in the same basic ways" (2016, xvi).
On the other hand, organization is not operation, and the
latter is the place where presidents' individual preferences
should matter most. President Nixon's case, in fact, exem-
plifies the point; there have long been rumors that Nixon's
"system" was not as robust as it seemed. Tantalizing tales
of Nixon's wallowing, wandering, drinking, and mumbling
during Watergate hint that the scandal not only broke "the
man," but also "the model" he created. By August 1973,
columnist Stewart Alsop worried the President was "on the
naked edge of a nervous breakdown" (1973); Hunter S.
Thompson reported Mr Nixon was "crazy with rage and
Did Nixon quit before he resigned?

Abstract
On August 9, 1974, Richard M. Nixon formally resigned the presidency; however, folklore hints Nixon informally
quit fulfilling his duties well before then. As Watergate became less "a third rate burglary" than "high crimes and
misdemeanors," rumors of President Nixon's wallowing, wandering, drinking, and mumbling swirled. Yet evidence
for such assertions has been thin, and prevailing scholarship offers compelling reasons to believe Nixon's institutional
protocols overrode his individual proclivities. This study offers a new, systematic look at Nixon's presidency by coding his
public events and private interactions with top government officials during every day of his presidency. Contrary to our
expectations, the results corroborate the rumors: Richard Nixon effectively quit being president well before he resigned
the presidency. In fact, it turns out there was a defining moment when Nixon disengaged from his administration: on
December 6, 1973, the day Gerald Ford was confirmed as Vice President.

booze and suicidal despair" (1976). This narrative gained
notoriety when Woodward and Bernstein's Final Days
(1974) depicted a distraught Nixon roving the White House,
whispering to his predecessors' portraits, and it gained
credibility when Alexander Haig, Nixon's final Chief of
Staff, acknowledged that he had had White House physi-
cians hide the President's pills for fear he might kill himself
(Chicago Tribune, 1995). David Gergen, a speechwriter in
Nixon's White House, stated the implication: "There was a
time during the Watergate crisis when President Nixon was
nearly incapacitated" (CNN, 2010).
This study offers a new, systematic look into President
Nixon's work habits throughout his presidency--inaugura-
tion to resignation. Specifically, after coding archival
records that detail President Nixon's public events and
behind-the-scenes contacts from January 20, 1969 to
August 9, 1974, we consider which thesis--"presidency-
centered" or "president-centered"--best captures Nixon's
work habits. To our surprise, the results corroborate the
rumors: Richard Nixon abandoned his model and, in fact,
effectively quit doing the job well before he resigned the
presidency. In particular, we discover there was a specific
day when Nixon effectively disengaged from his adminis-
tration: December 6, 1973, the day Gerald Ford was sworn
in as Vice President.
Measuring the president's work
Because demands on the president's time vastly outpace
its supply, "face time" with the president is among the
capital's most precious resources. This was especially true
during Richard Nixon's years. "Paradoxically," Henry
Kissinger wrote, "Nixon's abhorrence of face-to-face
meetings enabled his administration to deal with one of
the most important challenges of modern government: to
husband the President's time--his most precious com-
modity--so as to give him the opportunity for reflection"
(2000: 74).
As Kissinger's reflections indicate, Nixon's personal
contacts with government officials constitute a particularly
good indicator of his work habits (as opposed to, say, his
social calendar). Fortunately, the Presidential Daily Diary
includes a comprehensive log of those interactions. Here is
the Richard Nixon Presidential Library & Museum's hold-
ing description:
The Daily Diary of files represents a consolidated record of
the President's activities. The Daily Diary chronicles the
activities of the President, from the time he left the private
residence until he retired for the day, including personal and
private meetings, events, social and speaking engagements,
trips, telephone calls, meals, routine tasks, and recreational
pursuits. For any given meeting, telephone call, or event, the
Daily Diary usually lists the time, location, persons involved
(or a reference to an appendix listing individuals present),
and type of event.1
To extract the relevant details from these extraordinary
records, we first distributed the Nixon Library's Daily
Diaries collection among a large team of undergraduate stu-
dents, with each getting a random selection.2 The RA
assigned a particular day would then scour the correspond-
ing Diary to tally the President's 5-plus-minute contacts--
face-to-face or by phone--with the following top
government officials: Chief of Staff; National Security
Advisor; White House Counsel; White House Press
Secretary; Treasury Secretary; Defense Secretary; Secretary
of State; Speaker of the House; House Minority Leader;
Senate Majority Leader; Senate Minority Leader. The
result, then, was original data indicating Richard Nixon's
five-plus-minute contacts with 11 key government officials
during each day of his presidency.
First term consistency
For an opening glimpse into Nixon's work habits, Figure 1
shows the President's quarterly contacts with the key offi-
cials noted above. By way of interpretation, it is useful to
distinguish various time intervals, starting with Nixon's
first term, before Watergate became "Watergate."
The initial finding is an important one: Nixon was
scarcely "alone in the White House" during his first term.
The eleven leading officials studied here (collectively)
averaged more than 65 personal contacts per week with
President Nixon throughout his first four years in office.
And while closer inspection shows his contacts varied offi-
cial-to-official and day-to-day, the overall consistency
throughout the President's first 16 quarters is remarkable:
Richard Nixon's inaugural term was characterized by fre-
quent, consistent personal contact with a myriad of top gov-
ernment officials--from the White House, the Cabinet,
and, to a lesser degree, Capitol Hill.3 Such patterns

the House; House Minority Leader; Senate Majority Leader; Senate
Minority Leader.

corroborate the presidency-centered thesis that Nixon's
"model" structured his deliberation and decision-making--
at least for his first four years.
Second term denouement
If frequency and consistency hallmarked Nixon's first-term
interactions with key officials, things clearly changed
thereafter: the President's personal contacts plummeted
during his (truncated) second term. Focusing on the same
11 key government officers, we find Nixon's personal
interactions fell from 65 contacts per week during his first
four years to 40 contacts per week in 1973, then to fewer
than 10 contacts per week into 1974. Put differently, during
his final eight months in the White House, the President's
weekly meetings with top officials were just 15% as fre-
quent as they had been throughout his first term.4
To interrogate these results in greater detail, let us home
in on President Nixon's closest advisors during the critical
period--starting with the Watergate break-in and ending
with the President's resignation. Figure 2 displays President
Nixon's five-plus-minute contacts, either face-to-face or
over-the-phone, with his Chief of Staff (H.R. Haldeman
until April 30, 1973 and Alexander Haig thereafter),
National Security Advisor (Henry Kissinger, who also
became Secretary of State on September 22, 1973), and
Press Secretary (Ron Ziegler) for each week after the
Watergate break-in. We include these officials partly
because they occupy important posts, but also because
Nixon cites them as his closest advisors even in his darkest
days (Nixon, 1978: 1078). We overlay the figure with a
timeline of Watergate's significant moments.
Several patterns stand out. First, despite the Watergate
burglars' arrest, indictment, and conviction (June 1972 to
April 1973), we find Nixon's interactions with Haldeman,
Kissinger, and Ziegler held steady into the spring of 1973.
This continuity persisted even as the trial's presiding judge,
John Sirica, openly (and effectively) pressured the Watergate
defendants to disclose their ties to the Nixon campaign and/
or administration. Indeed, Figure 2 reveals no evidence that
the burgeoning crisis had much of an impact on President
Nixon's work habits vis-à-vis his closest advisors at first.
Second, Nixon's steady work habits held through the
summer and fall of 1973. This persistence is striking when
one considers just how perilous 1973 was for Nixon: in
April, White House counsel John Dean began cooperating
with federal officials; in May, Dean gave nationally-tele-
vised testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee; in
July, Alexander Butterfield revealed Nixon had a secret
recording system; in October, reporters decried Nixon's fir-
ing of the special prosecutor over Justice Department offi-
cials'objections (the so-called "Saturday Night Massacre");
in November, White House attorneys informed Judge Sirica
that an 18½-minute section of a subpoenaed tape had been
inexplicably erased. And yet, battered by these devastating
developments (and dismal poll numbers), President Nixon
nonetheless continued to meet consistently with his Chief
of Staff, National Security Advisor, and Press Secretary.
One year into his second term, then, President Nixon's
core internal deliberations had largely proven impervious
to Watergate revelations. Though less voluminous than dur-
ing his first term, Nixon's second-term contacts with key
government officials remained frequent and consistent.
Even when H. R. Haldeman (and John Erlichman)
resigned--a loss Nixon compared to "cutting off my
arms"--the President transitioned seamlessly to working
with his new Chief of Staff, Al Haig. Returning to Figure 2
demonstrates how President Nixon's meetings with his
Chief of Staff continued unabated after Haldeman's tenure
ended and Haig's began (before and after timeline point 4).

4 Research and Politics 
A breaking point
However, after a year of relative consistency, Richard
Nixon's personal contact with key officials dropped off,
starkly and suddenly, starting in December 1973.Alexander
Haig's example is illustrative. Here are Nixon and Haig's
average weekly contacts during the summer and fall of
1973: 27 (June); 21 (July); 18 (August); 24 (September); 32
(October); 26 (November). Then comes December, when
contacts between Nixon and Haig fall to just five contacts
per week. They never rebounded. In fact, Richard Nixon
averaged just two contacts per week with his Chief of Staff
through his presidency's final eight months. The same pat-
tern held for Kissinger and Ziegler.
Drilling deeper, and to our surprise, we detected a spe-
cific day on which Richard Nixon effectively disengaged
from his administration: December 6, 1973, the day Gerald
Ford was sworn in as Vice President.5 Figure 3 displays
President Nixon's total weekly contacts with the aforemen-
tioned 11 key officials before and after Jerry Ford's confir-
mation. In the 12 weeks before that date, Nixon averaged 8
(standard deviation = 5) contacts per day with top officials;
in the 12 weeks after that date, he averaged 1 (standard
deviation = 1).6 This does not mean it was Ford's ascension
per se that devastated Nixon; rather, we suspect Ford's con-
firmation was merely the last straw--the point when Nixon
realized his hopes for surviving Watergate were dashed.
While Nixon's memoirs only briefly address Gerald
Ford's confirmation, details from Nixon's closest advisors
help explain why this was such a blow to Nixon. In the
spring of 1973, President Nixon still believed he could and
would avoid impeachment and retain power. To help ensure
as much, Nixon decided Gerald Ford would make an
acceptable Vice President not only because lawmakers
would confirm him, but also because he believed those
same lawmakers would be reticent to give Ford the presi-
dency. According to Henry Kissinger, Nixon felt Ford's
"selection would dampen desires to impeach him because
the Congress would not want to run the risk of placing a
supposedly inexperienced man in charge of foreign affairs"
(Kissinger, 1979: 514). Similarly, H. R. Haldeman said
Nixon presumed House members, knowing Ford as well as
they did, would never impeach Nixon and make Ford
President (Ambrose,1991: 238). According to one aide, the
President had been even more blunt: Charles Colson
reported that Nixon described Ford as an "insurance pol-
icy" against impeachment (Hersh, 1983: 58).
It thus appears, as historian Stephen Ambrose eluci-
dates, that "[Nixon] did not select Ford in order to make it
easier for the Democrats to impeach him. Nor did he expect
to be impeached, or forced to resign." (1991: 238) However,
"Nixon made a misjudgment" (1991: 238). The reality was
that Gerald Ford's ascension sealed Richard Nixon's
demise, as the next day's New York Times' front-page story
indicated: "But the drama of the day was heightened by the
realization of those present that with Mr Ford installed as
Vice President, sentiment for impeachment of Mr Nixon--
or pressure on him to resign--would intensify" (Hunter,
1973). Clearly, Nixon felt that "pressure."
Maintaining impressions
One question left open is whether Nixon sought to main-
tain a good public face. That is, did the President depict a
steady outward appearance, or did his public schedule
match his private one--declining before collapsing alto-
gether? To compare President Nixon's "on stage" work
habits to his "behind-the-scenes" ones, we drew on Gerhard
Peters and John T. Woolley's invaluable American
Presidency Project (2016), which consolidates "The Public
Papers of the Presidents" by date and document type.
Pulling from this database, we tallied all of President
Nixon's public events during each day of his presidency.7
Figure 4 plots President Nixon's public events by quar-
ter. Across this timespan, President Nixon averaged a pub-
lic event every other day, although the distribution of such
activities was highly variable. Most days included no pub-
lic events; on October 28, 1970, Nixon issued eight sepa-
rate public statements, his maximum. Nixon's public
activities were more frequent during his first two years in
office (five events per week in 1969, four in 1970) before
settling at an average of two or three events per week for
the years that followed.
The differences between Nixon's private and public
activities are clear. Whereas Nixon's private contacts with
top officials declined in the second term and then fell off a
cliff starting in December 1973, his public schedule

Advisor; White House Press Secretary; Treasury Secretary; Defense
Secretary; Secretary of State; Attorney General; Speaker of the House;

remained relatively consistent during his final year in
office. Even his last quarter's public schedule was busier
than it appears because the count gets cut short by his res-
ignation. In fact, Nixon's average number of public events
per day was greater in his last quarter (1974, quarter 3) than
it had been one year earlier (1973, quarter 3).
This pattern holds throughout the Watergate crisis.
Figure 5 displays President Nixon's public events by week,
starting with the break-in and ending with his resignation.
Even at this greater resolution, we see President Nixon's
public activities continued largely uninterrupted as
Watergate drew closer and more dire (the correlation
between weeks in office and public events during his sec-
ond term is .07).8 Just looking at his public activities, then,
one would find little evidence of Nixon's diminished work-
load.9 Indeed, we find President Nixon's "on stage" activi-
ties proved far more durable than his "behind-the-scenes"
meetings.
Discussion
As political scientists have eschewed "president-centered"
theories for "presidency-centered" ones, Richard Nixon's
experience presents an intriguing case. While Mr Nixon's
personality was once cited as integral to understanding his
presidency, recent research emphasizes Nixon's role in
forging the institutional presidency. That President Nixon
embodied this intrinsic tension--"man" versus "model"--
inspired us to test whether Nixon's work routines were as
robust as his model or as brittle as its creator.
To that end, we drew on an extraordinary archival
resource--the Presidential Daily Diary--to discover that
Nixon's "system" did seem to discipline his deliberations
through his first term, and even into his second. However,
we also found strong evidence that Nixon "the man" ulti-
mately discarded his "model," operating more or less in
isolation during his last eight months in office. Perhaps
most striking of all was how abruptly this change occurred,
upending White House deliberations in a single moment:
the day Gerald Ford was sworn in as Vice President.
A follow-up investigation of President Nixon's public
activities--his public addresses, remarks, and news confer-
ences--evidenced no comparable decline. Even as his work
behind-the-scenes fell to one-seventh of the level it had
been during his first term, President Nixon continued to
hold public events, even into the waning days of his
besieged presidency. We thus find Richard Nixon main-
tained the façade of working long after he quit doing the
work itself.
More valuable than clarifying the historical record on
Richard Nixon, his model, or his legacy are the broader
implications for understanding the modern presidency. The
first is a greater awareness concerns presidency research
and evidence. To date, most empirical data on presidents'

influence draw from their work outside the White House--
their relations with the citizens, reporters, lawmakers,
judges, and beyond--rather than on the chief executives'
activities inside the West Wing. There are many reasons for
this external focus--not the least of which is presidents
purposefully conceal their inner-workings--and much has
been learned about the nature of presidential influence with
others, especially its limits. Nonetheless, Nixon's experi-
ence reminds us that the place where "president-centered"
factors are likely to matter most is the very place the schol-
arly literature and empirical record is thinnest: presidents'
work behind-the-scenes, inside the White House.
That leads to a second noteworthy lesson emerging from
this study: "presidency-centered" models of presidential
behavior presume presidents are purposeful, if not fully
rational. "Rationality" is a reasonable assumption in most
cases, and it has helped presidency scholars identify the
(considerable) constraints on presidents' discretion and
influence. But as much as we have developed insightful
theories to help understand what happens when presidents
reach for the ceiling, it is important to recall just how little
we know about what happens when they fall to the floor--
because they can, as Nixon did.

Notes
1. On June 14, 1971, responsibility for compiling the Daily
Diary moved from the White House to a semi-autonomous
unit in the Office of Presidential Papers & Archives, the
National Archives & Records Administration. More back-
ground and the full set of scanned Diaries are available online
(http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8pg1sbx/).
2. To assess inter-coder reliability, research assistants (RAs)
double-coded six (randomly selected) days per year. The
overall agreement was 91% for all of Nixon's contacts, and
in cases where a RA identified at least one contact between
Nixon and an official in our study, the correlation with the
other RA's coding was 0.84. Further examination revealed
that errors almost always reflected contacts missed, not ones
assigned incorrectly, meaning our findings are marginally
biased downward.
3. Nixon's most frequent conversations during his first term
were with keyWhite House staff (averaging about 55 personal
contacts per staffer, per month), followed by key Cabinet
Secretaries ( about 10 personal contacts per Secretary, per
month), and then each party's congressional leaders (< 3
personal contacts per member, per month). These results are
detailed in Figure A.1 in the online appendix.
4. It is worth noting the tremendous decline in Nixon's number
of contacts was not matched by dramatic changes in their
distribution. Nixon's overall first-term contacts were distrib-
uted 85% to key White House officials, 11% to key Cabinet
Secretaries, and 4% to key Congressional Leaders. That was
similar to what they were in 1973, when Nixon's contact dis-
tribution was 84% White House, 10% Cabinet Secretaries,
6% congressional leaders. Even 1974 had a comparable
breakdown: 81% White House, 7% Cabinet Secretaries, 12%
congressional leaders.
5. To interrogate Nixon's work and its apparent "change point"
more systematically, we extend the analyses above with a
change point analysis (CPA) using flat priors (see Spirling,
2007; Western and Kleykamp, 2004). Results confirmed
Ford's confirmation comprised a "change point," with
the 95% confidence interval spanning just one day around
December 7, 1973 (with pre
= 8.3 and post
= 1.4).
6. The obvious worry is this "change point" reflects an archival
artifact rather than real behavioral differences. We thus con-
sulted Nixon Library archivists, asking them to help inves-
tigate this very point. After searching through the relevant
holdings and inspecting the corresponding files, they found
no indication Daily Diary procedures were modified. If any-
thing, their findings corroborated the inference that it was
Richard Nixon, not the Daily Diary, that changed.
7. Specifically, for each day, we counted results identified as
"oral addresses," "oral remarks," or "news conferences."
8. Rerunning the CPA using non-informative priors to the pub-
lic events data finds that the "change point" in Nixon's public
schedule fell between November and December of 1970, just
after the 1970 midterm election (with pre
= 0.6 and post
= 0.3).
9. Before gathering the more detailed "Public Papers" data, we
previously had RAs code the Daily Diary, indicating whether
President Nixon held an "event intended for a public audi-
ence" during each day. The findings from the two sources
yield the same results, as displayed in the online appendix,
Figure A.2, which bolsters our confidence in both the "con-
tact" findings above and the "public" results here.
