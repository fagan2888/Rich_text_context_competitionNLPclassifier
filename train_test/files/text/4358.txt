Introduction
The concept of categories has spawned a wide set of
research papers which stress the importance of members
abiding by the rules set forth by the categories of which
they are members. This line of research points to the nega-
tive impact that spanning categories have on the life chances
of the organizations (Hsu, 2006; Hsu, Hannan, & Koçak,
2009; Hsu, Negro, & Perretti, 2008; Kovacs & Hannan,
2009; Leung & Sharkey, 2009; Negro, Hannan, & Rao,
2010; Pontikes, 2010; Zuckerman, 2004). This need to
abide by social codes is confronted with the need of organi-
zations to differentiate themselves from the competitors
(Deephouse, 1999; Navis & Glynn, 2010; King & Whetten,
2008; Zuckerman, 1999, 2004).
Literature Review
One of the earliest, and most important, theoretical develop-
ments of organizational ecologists was the notion of niche
width.1 According to Freeman and Hannan (1983), "niche
width refers to a population's tolerance for changing levels
of resources, its ability to resist competitors, and its response
to other factors that inhibit growth" (p. 1118). The concept of
niche width is at the heart of the study of generalist and spe-
cialist organizations. In essence, the study of the distribution
and the dynamics of these two types of organizations is the
study of niche width (Hannan & Freeman, 1977). Subsequent
studies have compared the founding, disbanding, and sur-
vival rates of organizations that were classified into one of
these two types. In his seminal paper, Carroll (1985) studied
how the dynamics of generalists in fact led to the prolifera-
tion of specialists. The fundamental point made by that paper
was that the two types of organizations were in fact con-
nected in the resource space and that the activities of one
group had a significant effect on the dynamics of the other.
The resource partitioning theory provides a very attractive
theoretical framework for explaining real-world phenome-
non that ran counter to dominant theories that predicted

Cluster Formation as a Representation
of the Category Space: A Two-Level
Theoretical Model Tested Within the
Context of the Lebanese Newspaper
Industry (1851-1974)
Najib A. Mozahem1
Abstract
Researchers in organizational ecology have started to pay more attention to audience perceptions. Legitimacy, for example,
is no longer modeled as the number of organizations in a population. It is now thought to be dependent on how audience
members perceive these organizations. It is believed that audiences penalize organizations that span categories because they
cannot make much sense of them. This article will argue that category spanning dynamics follow the pattern proposed by
the resource partitioning theory, thereby questioning the legitimacy of the claim that category spanning is detrimental to
organization survival. Instead, the article develops a two-level model which distinguishes between category spanning and
cluster spanning. The article will argue that cluster spanning, and not category spanning, increases the mortality hazard of
organizations during all time periods. The theory is then tested within the context of the Lebanese newspaper industry
(1851-1974). The result of both cluster analysis and survival analysis supports the two-level model.

homogeneity in organizational forms within populations.
Hannan and Freeman (1993) described how three environ-
mental variables dictate what the best form of organization
is: environmental variability, grain, and dissimilarity. In a
similar manner, institutionalists posit that organizational
fields are subjected to a strong force which pushes them in
the direction of homogenization (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983;
March, 1981). If organizations are forced to become homo-
geneous due to environmental pressures, then how can we
explain the coexistence of both generalists and specialists in
a diverse set of mature industries (Carroll & Hannan, 2004)?
The resource partitioning theory provided a very plausible
explanation.
An important question that researchers were faced with
was how to determine the niche width of organizations. In
other words, how do we decide which organization was a
specialist and which was a generalist? This question is of
fundamental importance because the researcher must be able
to systematically classify the organizations into the proper
group. Previously, this question was answered using a dis-
crete mechanism. In their study of restaurants, Freeman and
Hannan (1983) grouped 33 forms into three categories: gen-
eralists, fast-food establishment, and specialists. Carroll
(1985) defined as generalists those organizations which pub-
lished one or more general interest newspapers, while clas-
sifying the rest as specialists. Carroll and Swaminathan
(1992) and Swaminathan and Carroll (1995) classified orga-
nizations in one of three forms: mass producers, microbrew-
eries, and brewpubs. Boone, Carroll, and van Witteloostuijn
(2002) considered the national newspapers which operated
in every province to be the generalists, while local newspa-
pers were taken as the specialists. Lomi (1995) divided the
banks into core national banks and rural cooperative banks.
Some studies attempted to develop more flexible mea-
sures to determine the niche width of organizations. Baum
and Singh (1994) used a measure of niche width which was
based on the age groups which centers catered to; McPherson
(1983) utilized a measure which was based on the demo-
graphic information of the members of voluntary organiza-
tions; Dobrev, Kim, and Carroll (2002) utilized the size of
the organization to create a continuum along which the larger
the organization the more "generalist" it was; Dobrev, Kim,
and Hannan (2001) measured the niche width of an automo-
bile producer as the spread of engine capacity over all mod-
els that are produced by a firm, but they only use the
maximum and minimum engine capacities; and Hsu (2006)
calculated the niche width as the number genres that each
film was classified under. With the exception of the use of
size as an indicator for the level of generalism, which is in
itself problematic (Blau & Scott, 2003; Dobrev et al., 2001),
all these measures share a basic assumption, and that is that
the organization is a full-fledged member of each area in the
resource space which it targets.
In recent years, Pólos, Hannan, and Carroll have devel-
oped a new theoretical framework which was based on the
use of nonmonotonic logic (Hannan, Pólos, & Carroll, 2007;
Pólos & Hannan, 2001, 2002).Aprimary departure from pre-
vious theoretical models is that "instead of treating catego-
ries as analytic, as products of researchers distinctions, we
assume that the members of audience segments create cate-
gories and forms" (Hannan et al., 2007, p. 33). In their view,
audience members, be they regular customers or industry
critics, tend to group similar organizations into categories to
which they assign labels.2 Organizations are no longer
thought of as being full-fledged members of the category or
not being members at all. Instead, each producer is assigned
a grade of membership3 which can take any value between,
and including, zero and one.
Using this new formulation, Hsu et al. (2009) revisited the
topic of niche width. They proposed a measure which
allowed for examining "the degrees of generalism, rather
than a binary comparison of specialists versus non-special-
ists" (Hsu et al., 2009, p. 158). The measure proposed is
Simpson's index of diversity (Simpson, 1949):
1 2
- ( )
 ( )
( )

l l m
i l
x
µ ,
where µ
i l
x
( )
( ) represents the grade of membership of the
producer in the category l. The grade of membership was
determined by the following formula:
µi l
i
x
l x
l
( ) =
( )
,
where l
x
is the total number of labels applied to the pro-
ducer x. The numerator was set to one when a certain label
was applied to the producer and to zero otherwise. The
Simpson's index can take on any value in the interval [0, 1],
with zero indicating that the producer spans only a single
category in which his grade of membership is one. The
higher the index the higher the degree of generalism. This
new conceptualization of the niche width was used in several
studies, thus replacing the old binary classification scheme.
Kovacs and Hannan (2009) took the next logical step by
proposing that the niche width of organizations needs to
account for, at least to some degree, the structure of the cat-
egory space.4 According to them, the measure of niche width
needs to include the "distance" between the categories that
an organization spans. They argued that spanning categories
that were close to one another should increase the niche
width of the organization far less than spanning categories
that had a large distance between them. The grade of mem-
bership of a certain producer was now modified so that the
magnitude of the decline in the grade of membership
depended on the distance between the labels. Next, the
authors tackle the question of how to determine the distance
between categories. This leads them to adopt the formula
based on the work of Shepard (1987) where similarity is
inversely related to distance. So the question of finding the
distance now becomes one of finding the similarity. To find
Mozahem 3
the similarity between two categories, the authors modified
the measure proposed by Jaccard (1901) so that it allowed
for asymmetry. With these new definitions of grade of mem-
bership, distance, and similarity, the authors also proposed a
new formula for the niche width. The reason for this was that
if we used Simpson's index together with the new grade of
membership formula, then the result can be negative, and
this does not make sense (Kovacs & Hannan, 2009).
Development of Research Problem
The topic of niche width is linked to the concept of catego-
ries. Organizations that have a large niche width span catego-
ries while those that have a small niche width tend to
concentrate their efforts on specific locations in the resource
space (Hsu et al., 2009). The work of Kovacs and Hannan
(2009), Hsu (2006), Hsu et al. (2009), and Hannan et al.
(2007) all point in the same direction: Spanning categories is
a hazardous act. Zuckerman (1999) and Zuckerman (2000)
have shown that critics and analysts penalize products that
do not fit in certain categories due to confusion over the
product's identity, while Zuckerman and Kim (2003) have
also shown that market boundaries severely restrict the range
of identities that economic actors can presume. Such results
have been corroborated by a large number of researchers
(Hsu, 2006; Hsu et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2008; Kovacs &
Hannan, 2009; Leung & Sharkey, 2009; Negro et al., 2010;
Pontikes, 2010; Zuckerman, 2004). Several reasons have
been proposed for such a downgrade: being a member of
several categories means abiding by different social codes at
the same time (Hsu & Hannan, 2005) which may lead to
clashes of category codes (Kovacs & Hannan, 2009); there is
an inherent trade-off between niche width and the capacity
for performance (Hsu, 2006); organizations that do not abide
by social codes lose legitimacy and hence appeal (King &
Whetten, 2008); audience members find difficulty in evalu-
ating the offerings of such organizations (Leung & Sharkey,
2009), or they simply do not view them favorably (Leung,
2010). Finally, Kovaçs and Johnson (2013) found that a
number of the above factors might be involved.
While the general findings of most of these articles are
aligned, several findings seem to suggest that the conse-
quences of category spanning are context-dependent (Hsu
et al., 2008). Pontikes (2008), for example, found that mem-
bers of "lenient"5 categories were able to span boundaries
much more easily than members of categories which were
not lenient. A similar result was obtained by Kovacs and
Hannan (2009) and Hsu et al. (2008), who found that the
effect of category spanning was contingent on the "fuzzi-
ness" of the category to which the organization belonged.
Kovacs and Hannan (2009) found that once the structure of
the space of categories is accounted for, quantitative results
would differ not only by magnitude but also by sign. Time
has also appeared to play an important role. Zuckerman,
Kim, Ukanwa, and von Rittmann (2003) found that film stars
that have many years of experience are able to straddle cat-
egories by acting in different genres, while less experienced
actors were heavily penalized for the same action. On the
contrary, Ruef and Patterson (2009) found that in the original
stages of classification systems, there were low risks of
devaluation because category heuristics were not well devel-
oped. With time, however, these heuristics developed into
strict codes that members had to abide by. Rao, Monin, and
Durand (2005) highlighted the dynamic nature of categories
when they noted that the strength of category boundary was
eroded as more and more producers crossed them. Recently,
an interesting finding has suggested that in some cases, it
might not be the properties of the categories themselves that
determine the effect of category spanning, but factors exog-
enous to the categories. Pontikes (2010) found that different
types of audiences react differently to category spanners
while Phillips and Zuckerman (2001) found that it was the
position of the producer inside the category that decided
whether conforming was good or bad. Smith (2011), on the
contrary, has found that the identity of organizations deter-
mines whether border-crossing activities are viewed posi-
tively or negatively.
While I believe that the category space needs to be
accounted for, I believe that the formulation posited by
Kovacs and Hannan (2009) could be further improved. This
can be done in two ways. First, I believe that the entire struc-
ture of the category space needs to be taken into consider-
ation, not just the distance between two specific categories.
Second, I believe that the concept of distance needs to be
accounted for not on the level of categories, but on the level
of clusters that are formed from the dynamics of categories.
Problems With the Distance-Based Measures
One issue with the distance-based measure is that the sum of
the grade of memberships of a certain producer does not
necessarily add up to one. Theoretically, this is not really a
problem because the grade of membership is not a probabi-
listic function, and therefore there is no requirement that the
sum be equal to one (Hannan, 2010). However, by con-
straining the grades-of-membership to be equal to one, or at
least equal to each other, we would be in alignment what is
referred to as the principle of allocation. Hannan (2010, p.
168) stated that "the level of total category engagement is
normally the same for all producers in a market," while
Hannan et al. (2007, p. 180) also imposed the "constant-
sum" approach.
Another problem with the distance-based measure is that
the grade of membership function is affected neither by fea-
tures of the product or producer nor by the producer's
engagement in the category. Hannan et al. (2007) stated that
"a natural step in seeking to comprehend the bases of mem-
bership in a label involves relating the feature values of the
producers/products to their grades of membership in a label"
(p. 60) and " . . . the grade of membership in a position is the
4 SAGE Open
share of (producer) x's engagement devoted to the audience
at that position" (p. 180). If the grade of membership func-
tion reflects the appeal of an offering (Hannan et al., 2007),
and engagement increases the appeal of the producer (Koçak,
Hannan, & Hsu, 2009), then surely engagement affects the
grade of membership of that producer (Hsu et al., 2009).
Most research so far has used a binary function such that if a
producer spans a category then the function is set to one and
if not then it is set to zero (Carroll, Feng, Le Mens, &
McKendrick, 2010; Hsu et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2008; Kovacs
& Hannan, 2009; Pontikes, 2008, 2010). I believe that the
grade of membership should distinguish between the levels
of commitment that the producer applies in each category.
The next issue with the distance-based niche width is
more important than all of the above. Previous studies have
shown that in many industries there comes a time when gen-
eralists take over the market. This is usually manifested as an
increase in the market concentration ratio (Dobrev et al.,
2002; Lomi, 1995; Marquis & Lounsbury, 2007). The
increase in the number of generalists means that the propor-
tion of times that categories are mentioned together will also
increase. This, in turn, will lead to a decrease in the distance
between the categories as the distance measure is based on
the similarity measure, which is based on a frequentist
approach. The decrease in the distance between the catego-
ries will lead to a decrease in the niche width of the generalist
organization. So by increasing the number of generalists,
these generalists are no longer generalists because their niche
width decreases.
One of the proposed reasons that spanning categories is
hazardous to organizations is that audience members penal-
ize nonconformity. Imagine now that there exists a category
space in which two certain categories always co-occur
together at a certain point in time. Now imagine that a new
organization comes along and decides that it wants to span
just one of these categories. This would cause a decrease in
the grade of membership of all exiting organizations, while
the new organization will have a zero niche width because it
only spans one category. Because a smaller niche width is
more favorable than a larger niche width, the original organi-
zations end up being punished while the new organization is
not penalized for ignoring the second category, even though
it is the new organization that has not conformed to the mar-
ket dynamics.
The final problem with the proposed distance-based mea-
sure is that it only takes into account the actions of organiza-
tions that span the two focal categories when it calculates the
distance between these categories. This might seem to be the
logical thing at first, but it is important here to take note of
the nature of categories. It is generally accepted that catego-
ries are socially constructed entities (Kennedy, 2005; Rosa,
Porac, Runser-Spanjol, & Saxon, 1999; White, 1981, 2000).
Therefore, the distance between categories is not an absolute
measure that is independent of the surroundings. The dis-
tance between two categories is relative due to their socially
constructed nature, so the context in which they exist must be
taken into account. Previously, researchers have posited that
the actions and resources of one population affect other pop-
ulations (Freeman & Hannan, 1983), that competition is
socially constructed (Porac, Thomas, Wilson, Paton, &
Kanfer, 1995) and that it is largely a function of relative posi-
tions in the resource space (Baum & Haveman, 1997), and
that the creation of reality in organizations is an ongoing pro-
cess (Weick, 1995). Therefore, if in a socially constructed
world (Berger & Luckmann, 1967), actions that take place in
one organizational population can affect organizations in
another population, it seems natural to argue that actions that
take place, within the same population, in one category have
an effect on other categories. In addition, if organizational
reality and competition are themselves socially constructed,
then significant shifts in the competition landscape (i.e.,
number of competitors and their average niche width) should
affect how audience members evaluate all competitors.
Dobrev et al. (2001) argued that "an organization can experi-
ence a change in its relative position without making any
changes in its own product offerings" (p. 1306).
Clusters: A Multilevel Approach
How do we incorporate the category structure in the study of
categories while overcoming the above issues? I believe that
the solution lies in dividing the analysis into two parts. The
distance-based measures proposed by Kovacs and Hannan
(2009) incorporate the concept of distance at the category
level, thus affecting the definition of grade of membership
and niche width. My solution leaves the definition of niche
width as proposed by Hsu et al. (2009) and incorporates the
category space on a second level which I refer to as clusters.
It should be noted that clusters, as formulated in this arti-
cle, are different from what Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson,
and Boyes-Braem (1976) referred to as superordinate cate-
gories. The delineation between subordinate, basic, and
superordinate categories is a question of finding the "natu-
ral" level of categorization. Clusters, which are formed from
category spanning activity, are on the contrary not natural.
Their formation is dependent on the category spanning
dynamics of organizations, and therefore they are nonnatural
objects that are dynamically formed. This difference between
superordinate categories and clusters is reflected in the fact
that the question of the level of categorization is related to
the taxonomy:
A taxonomy is a system by which categories are related to
another by means of class inclusion . . . Each category within a
taxonomy is entirely included within one other category (unless
it is the highest level category) but is not exhaustive of that more
inclusive category. (Rosch et al., 1976, p. 383)
The same cannot be said about clusters. A cluster does not
necessarily include all of a category and a certain category
Mozahem 5
can be included within more than one cluster. A cluster is not
just another level in the taxonomy. It allows us to understand
the relationship between different categories in the category
space which arises due to the activities of organizations,
hence the relationship between clusters and niche width as
discussed above.
I determine the grade of membership  of an issue in
each category as the proportion of that issue that is dedi-
cated to the category. The main advantage of this method is
that this measure takes into account the engagement of the
producer in each category. The greater the resources dedi-
cated to a certain category, the higher the grade of member-
ship. We can also see that this method allows for the sum of
the grades-of-memberships to be equal to one for all news-
papers. Now that we have a grade of membership in each
category, we follow the lead of Hannan et al. (2007) and
Hsu et al. (2009) and define the niche width using Simpson's
index of dissimilarity as
1
1
2
-
=

i
I
µ .
This measure takes values between zero and one, with a zero
indicating that the organization spans a single category.
Now that we have the grade of membership and the niche
width of the issue, we need to determine to which cluster the
issue belongs. To do this, I use the statistical method of clus-
ter analysis (Everitt, Landau, Leese, & Stahl, 2011). In the
cluster analysis presented in this article, I used as a measure
of proximity the Pearson correlation measure and used the
weighted-average linkage as the linkage method. The reason
for these two choices is as follows: First, with regard to the
proximity measure, Everitt et al. (2011) noted that the nature
of the data should determine the choice of this measure. If
the variables measure the proportion of engagement that a
producer dedicates to a certain category, then they can take
any value between 0 and 1. In such a case, it makes more
sense to talk about the correlation between the data than to
talk about the distance. The variables provide an indication
of the "relative profile" of the observation. The correlation
between observations i and j is found using the following
formula:

where x x p

/ and p is the number of variables
(Stata Corporation, 2011, p. 506). Because the correlation
takes on values in the interval [-1,1], it is converted into a
distance measure which takes on values in the interval [0,1]
using the formula 
ij ij
= -
( )
1 2
/ . Unlike the Jaccard index
mentioned previously, this measure takes into account the
engagement of each producer in each category. With regard
to the choice of the linkage method, the weighted-average
method "gives equal weights to each cluster regardless of
how many observations it contains. Such methods conse-
quently tend to work better for detecting clusters of unequal
size" (Hamilton, 2009, p. 358).
The above formulation has several desirable properties
that overcome the limitations of including a distance-based
measure on the category level. First, the grade of member-
ship is dependent on the producers'engagement, and the area
under the fitness curve is constant and equal for all produc-
ers. Second, the proximity measure utilized also depends on
the proportion of resources dedicated to categories. It is not
enough to state that a certain organization spans a certain
category in order to calculate its distance from other catego-
ries. Third, the determination of the best-fit number of clus-
ters depends on all the information present, not just on
information pertaining to certain categories. Changes in cat-
egories and organizations that take place outside the focal
categories affect the best-fit number of clusters, and hence
affect the assignments of all producer to the clusters. The
determination of the best-fit number of clusters takes into
account the differences between the category dynamics as
well as the similarities (Everitt et al., 2011); thus, all the
information is utilized to determine the number of clusters.
Fourth, we no longer have the problem that a rise in general-
ists would lead to a decrease in the niche width of the gener-
alists because we have uncoupled the concept of niche width
from the concept of distance.
Revisiting Category Spanning: Formulation of
Hypotheses
If spanning more categories leads to a decrease in the engage-
ment that the producer dedicates to each category, why do
producers seek to span more and more categories? Past
research has shown that after a population has become legiti-
mated, more and more pressure is placed on producers in
order to distinguish their offerings from those of their com-
petitors (Navis & Glynn, 2010). The result is that producers
expand to new categories. In the case where the market is
susceptible to economies of scale, this pattern is further
enhanced because in addition to distinguishing their offers,
category spanning will also drive down costs because the
more categories a producer spans, the larger the number of
audience members it attracts. This pattern will eventually
lead to the rise of generalists, and the market will become
dominated by organizations that span as many categories as
possible. In the words of Carroll (1985), "in newspaper pub-
lishing, the dominance of generalists in the market represents
the equilibrium state of a long, competitive process dictated
by economies of scale" (p. 1268). Therefore, we would
expect to see that organizations expand their offerings by
entering new categories during the period of the "rise of the
6 SAGE Open
generalists." This rise of the generalists will take place after
the industry has successfully formed, because it is after the
process of legitimation that organizations find themselves
under more and more pressure to distinguish their offerings
(Navis & Glynn, 2010).
According to the resource partitioning theory, this increase
in the number of generalist organizations will lead to a highly
competitive landscape in which only a few generalists can
exist. By expanding their offerings in order to benefit from
economies of scale and in order to attract as many audience
members as possible, these organizations will find them-
selves competing with other large organizations in the same
resource space. The abandoned edges of the resource space
will attract new organizations that tailor their offerings in
such a way that fills a small portion of the resource space. By
doing so, these new specialist organizations will avoid com-
petition with the large and established generalists, while they
would manage to service audience members who are cur-
rently being neglected by the generalists. According to
Carroll (1984), "Hawley's model predicts that the losing
competitors are transformed; the resource partitioning model
predicts that those units die and that the differentiated units
come from new sources" (pp. 1278-1279). Therefore, these
specialists organizations are mostly made up of new organi-
zations that seek to occupy a narrow niche that they have
noticed is not being properly served.
Based on the above discussion, I do not believe that we
can say "category spanning is hazardous." Category span-
ning helps organizations distinguish themselves and helps
them benefit from economies of scale. The effect of environ-
ments on organizations has long been a topic of interest and
has received much attention from organizational theorists
(Aldrich, 2008; Aldrich & Ruef, 2006; Lawrence & Lorsch,
1967; Pfeffer & Salancik, 2003). Both exogenous and endog-
enous environmental factors can cause a shift in the effect of
the niche width of organizations (Swaminathan, 1998).
Resource partitioning theory describes how endogenous
changes can cause a significant shift in the effect of the niche
width. Hannan and Freeman (1984) have argued that certain
environments clearly favor generalist organizations. Many
factors can help favor one form over the other, such as econ-
omies of scale (Dobrev et al., 2002) and network embedded-
ness (Echols & Tsai, 2005). More importantly, the timing in
the industry evolution has proved to be critical in determin-
ing the effect of niche width (Dobrev et al., 2001). Research
has shown that with time, the effect of niche width on orga-
nizational mortality and on the founding rates of different
organizational forms is reversed. Swaminathan (1998) has
shown how founding rates of specialist organizations
increase as the concentration of the industry increases, while
Dobrev et al. (2001) and Dobrev et al. (2002) showed that as
market concentration increases the effects of niche width on
the hazard rate changes from negative to positive. Therefore,
I believe that the effect of category spanning, which deter-
mines the niche width, is not uniform throughout the lifetime
of the industry. I believe that, as the resource partitioning
theory predicts, at certain stages in the industry lifetime, the
environment would favor generalists who are trying to dis-
tinguish themselves, or who are benefiting from economies
of scale. During these periods, I do not believe that spanning
categories will be hazardous to organizations.
Hypothesis 1: The effect of category spanning is time
dependent.
However, once the industry has matured, the severe com-
petition between generalists in the middle of the resource
space will make it increasingly harder for generalists to sur-
vive. It is during this period that specialist organizations start
forming. By not spanning many categories, these specialists
will avoid direct competition with the generalists. If, how-
ever, an organization enters as a generalist, then it will be
faced with severe competition from incumbent generalists,
and therefore suffer from a high mortality rate. In addition,
the intense competition for the center of the resource space
will result in the death of some generalists because only a
limited number of generalists can survive in the market
(Carroll, 1985).
Hypothesis 2: Category spanning increases the hazard of
mortality or organizations once the industry matures and
specialists start to emerge.
As explained above, cluster formation depends on the cat-
egory dynamics in all the resource space, and not just
between two focal categories or producers. It is important to
note here that cluster spanning and category spanning are
two separate things that can, in some instances, involve the
same act. It is possible for an organization to expand its con-
tents by spanning a new category. The result may be that this
organization ends up in a new cluster. However, this is not
always the case. It is also possible for an organization to span
a new cluster by decreasing the number of categories
spanned. Finally, it is possible for an organization to span a
new cluster even if the number of categories that it spans
remains the same. Specialist organizations have considerable
freedom in their choice of "location" (Dobrev et al., 2002;
Dobrev et al., 2001).
I propose that audience members are confused when pro-
ducers span clusters. I believe that the act of moving from
cluster to cluster is hazardous to the organization's health
because audience members will have difficulty in determin-
ing to which group the organization belongs. When a pro-
ducer moves to a new cluster, then it will occupy a new
position in this category space. This movement is determined
by many factors, not just by whether the producer spanned
more categories or not. Because the number of clusters is
determined by using data from all producers, it might be the
case that a producer ends up in a different cluster simply
because the majority of organizations changed their category
Mozahem 7
spanning dynamics. In such a case, the entire category space
shifts and, even though the focal producer did not change its
category spanning dynamics, it ends up in a new position.
Because audience members view the position of the producer
in relation to the position of all other producers, the end
result will be that the producer's position has changed.
Another reason that is given to explain the hazardous effect
of category spanning is that the organization that attempts to
span a new category is not conforming to the "rules of the
game." An organization that crosses boundaries must be
penalized, especially in a market in which boundaries are
clearly delineated. However, it might be the case that the
norm in the industry is to span many categories. Many stud-
ies have talked about a certain industry being crowded by
generalist organizations. In such cases, it is the specialist
organization that does not conform to the norms. Therefore,
it is the organization that does not span categories that must
be penalized for being the nonconformist. Here again, clus-
ters help capture these dynamics. Finally, the work of Kovacs
and Hannan (2009) explained that spanning distant catego-
ries is hazardous. While I follow their lead in taking into
account the resource space, I do not mix the concepts of
niche width and category distance together. Because distance
is determined by the correlation between observations in this
article, and the best-fit number of clusters is determined by
the correlation that all observations have with all other obser-
vations, two different clusters represent two different sets of
correlations, and therefore the distance between a producer
in one set and another producer in another set is greater than
the distance between two producers in the same set. This
means that spanning clusters also captures the concept of dis-
tance. Instead of saying, "spanning distant categories is haz-
ardous," my model says, "changing your category dynamics
relative to the dynamics of other producers in such a way that
warrants a shift from cluster to cluster is hazardous." This is
similar to the argument made by Ruef and Patterson (2009),
who stated that rare combinations of components would
increase the hazard faced by organizations. Here, the word
"rare" indicates a relative concept. In my model, spanning a
combination of categories that is "rare" might lead the focal
organization to end up in a completely new cluster.
Hypothesis 3: Organizations that span clusters will have
a greater hazard of failure than those that do not span clus-
ters. This negative effect is not time dependent.
This article has described how category spanning is dif-
ferent than cluster spanning. I have argued that the effect of
category spanning is time dependent, while the effect of clus-
ter spanning is uniform because it is confusing to audience
members and because it might signal nonconformity. To test
the above hypothesis, the models will control for both
dynamics at the same time. As previously stated, not all clus-
ter spanning is a result of category spanning, and not all cat-
egory spanning results in cluster spanning. This explains
why previous research has found that category spanning is
not always hazardous.
Empirical Setting and Data Collection
The theories developed in this article will be tested within
the context of the Lebanese newspaper industry. The news-
paper industry has generally been a popular empirical setting
in the past. It has been used in studies of organizational
founding (Delacroix & Carroll, 1983), organizational mor-
tality (Carroll & Delacroix, 1982), resource distributions
(Boone et al., 2002), market partitioning (Carroll, 1985),
management change (Carroll, 1984), interorganizational
linkages (Miner, Amburgey, & Stearns, 1990), and organiza-
tional change (Amburgey, Kelly, & Barnett, 1993). The
choice of industry was motivated by two reasons. First, there
has been no study concerned with the organizational ecology
model that has been tested within any Arab industry. Second,
newspapers are well suited to the study of categories due to
the nature of the product. Throughout the years, the number
of newspapers published in Lebanon has been disproportion-
ally large when compared with those published in other
Arabic countries.
In the first stage of data collection, I collected the life his-
tory data of all the Lebanese newspapers from 1851 to 1974.
The sources for this stage were Tarazi (1933), Dagher (1978),
Khoury (1990), and Illias (1997). I then used Mruwi (1961),
al-Majlis al Thaqafi al-Lubnani (1996), Khoury (1999), and
Taleb (2011) to fill in some missing information. Finally, I
conducted several interviews with industry historian Joseph
Illiyas in order to fill in some missing information. By the
end of this stage, I was able to collect information about the
starting date, ending date, format (newspaper/magazine),
and frequency of publication. A publication was considered a
magazine if there was a table of contents at the beginning of
the issue or if the page numbering was continuous, that is, if
the first page in a magazine started off where the last page of
the previous issue stopped. I was also able to record dates of
when the ownership changed hands or when the journal
changed its format.
By the end of this stage, I had collected the following
information: There are a total of 1,759 newspapers, with
1,056 being published in Lebanon and 703 outside Lebanon.
Around 81% of the publications in Lebanon were published
in Beirut, while around 35% of publications outside Lebanon
were published in Egypt. With regard to the publications in
Lebanon, there are 59 cases of missing founding dates and
427 cases of missing disbanding dates. Out of these 427
cases, there are 164 cases of censoring before the end of the
study. This means that while I did not find the ending dates
of these publications, I managed to secure dates at which I
knew that they were still in circulation. Finally, there are 119
cases of censoring due to the study ending at the end of 1974.
The next step was to identify the categories. The justifica-
tion for the choice of categories is a question which must be
8 SAGE Open
addressed. In the case of this article, the justification is of a
more practical nature than it is theoretical. While going
through the newspapers, I noted the nature of the news sto-
ries and started classifying them. Items which were of a
political nature or an economic nature were well expected in
advance, but some other items came as a surprise. For exam-
ple, I was surprised to see that many newspapers dedicated a
significant portion of their space to literary issues that related
to the Arabic language. This led me to decide to create a sep-
arate category for such items because their frequency meant
that it would not be wise to disregard them by adding them to
another more general category. During the process of going
through the newspapers, I was able to identify nine different
categories. The categories are Politics, Economics, Social
Issues (education, immigration, etc.), Knowledge (math,
physics, etc.), Literature (Arabic grammar, poetry, novels,
etc.), Sport, Art, Advertisements, and Other (any item that
could not be classified into any of the above groups was
added to this group). The final data set consisted of 2,478
entries that belonged to 293 different newspapers.
Data Analysis
The first step in the analysis is to study how the newspaper
issues spanned the different categories over the duration of
the study period. To do that, I use Simpson's index. I calcu-
lated this index for every single newspaper issue in the data
set. I then grouped the issues according to their year of pub-
lication and calculated the average of the index and its stan-
dard deviation for every year. The results are presented in
Figure 2. The vertical lines in the graph have been inserted at
the points in which the graph shows that there was some
change in the dynamics. Prior to 1875 (the first vertical line),
the graph clearly shows that both the average and the stan-
dard deviation of Simpson's index were shifting with no
clear pattern. This is partly due to the fact that before 1865
there was a maximum of two issues per year. After 1875, we
see a completely different dynamic in that the average of
Simpson's index kept increasing while the standard devia-
tion was decreasing. The only explanation to this dynamic is
that most of the newspapers were broadening their coverage.
In other words, this period witnessed the rise of generalists.
The fact that the standard deviation kept decreasing tells us
that most of the newspapers followed this strategy. However,
this dynamic was reversed after 1894 (the second line) where
we can see that the average of Simpson's index started
decreasing while the standard deviation increased. A plausi-
ble explanation to this is that some newspapers were becom-
ing more specialized, concentrating on one, or at least on a
few, categories. However, this was not a universal strategy as
illustrated by the standard deviation. Therefore, we would
expect that this period saw the rise of some specialists with
some newspapers remaining generalists. The third and fourth
lines in the graph show the start and end of the First World
War. We can see that the category spanning becomes more
erratic during this period and represents a discontinuity in the
general dynamics of Simpson's index. The same can be seen
during the Second World War (between the fifth and sixth
lines). In between the two world wars, we see that neither the
average of Simpson's index nor the standard deviation
exhibit any changes. The seventh (and last) line represents
the point when the average of Simpson's index starts decreas-
ing while the standard deviation starts increasing. The
dynamic during this period is similar to the one described
above between 1894 and the start of the First World War in
1914. However, we can see that the slopes of the lines
become more consistent and have less variation in the very
last period. Again, the only explanation with regard to the
last period is that some newspapers were more specialized
while generalists continued to exist. This explanation is con-
sistent with resource partitioning theory of Carroll (1985).
Survival Analysis
I next performed survival analysis on the entire period from
1851 to 1974 (Hosmer, Lemeshow, & May, 2011). The pri-
mary function of interest is the hazard function, which is the
instantaneous rate of failure. It represents the probability that
the event of interest occurs conditional on the subject having
survived up to the present time:

I used the proportional hazards Cox model. The results of
the models are presented in Table 1. The models were suc-
cessfully tested for the proportional hazards assumption. It
should be noted here that all standard errors reported are
robust because I used the cluster option because my data
allow for multiple deaths for each newspaper. The first model
in the table is the base model, and it includes several control
variables. The first four variables are period control vari-
ables. The first variable indicates the start of the reign of
Sultan `abd al-Hamid up to the constitution of 1908. The
next two variables were period indicators for the two world
wars. The fourth variable indicates the period after the imple-
mentation of the 1953 law which restricted the number of
new licenses. The only statistically significant period indica-
tor was the World War I variable. Figure 1 shows how the
newspaper industry was almost wiped out during that period.
Next, I added to the model some industry-specific variables.
The first two are the total number of active newspapers and
its square. Past research in organizational ecology has uncov-
ered a U-shaped relationship between mortality and organi-
zational density (Carroll & Hannan, 2004). However, our
results indicate that there is a very narrow inverted-U shape,
contrary to almost universal findings in previous research,
but only the main term is significant. I also controlled for the

total population of Lebanon. Numbers for the total popula-
tion are severely lacking because the last census performed
by the government was in 1932 and, due to religious and
political grievances, the results of that consensus are highly
questionable (Hudson, 1985). I collected the available data
from Faour (1991), Harris (1997), and Tarbuls (2007) and
used linear interpolation to fill in the missing values.
Although the coefficient is statistically significant, its value
is extremely small. The last two variables I controlled for are
the 1-year lagged number of founding and disbanding events.
Some periods saw an increase in the founding events, for
example, after the 1908 constitution, and I wanted to see
whether an increase in founding events led to an increase in
mortality due to increased competition. With regard to dis-
banding events, I wanted to see whether newspaper disband-
ing events tended to happen at the same time, that is, that an
increase in disbanding events in 1 year was following with
more disbanding events in the next. The results show that
both coefficients are significant. It seems that a high number
of disbanding events in 1 year predicted higher mortality
rates for those that survive in the next, while a high number
of founding events predicted a lower mortality rate in the fol-
lowing year.
Next, in Model 1, I included some organization-level
control variables. I added a variable which indicated whether
a publication dealt with politics or not, the number of pages,
and the type of publication. Here it should be noted that
other than newspapers and magazines, some journals where
referred to as "matboo'a" (publication) in the sources. There
were only 27 cases such as this. The model results show that
these "publications" had a statistically significant higher
hazard rate when compared with magazines but that
the difference between magazines and newspapers was not
significant. We see that after we added these organization-
level variables, the number of active newspapers, and the
lagged founding events are no longer significant. We can
clearly see that Model 1 is a much better fit than the base
model. I next added indicator variables that indicated in
which period the newspaper was founded (results are not
shown in the table) but none of them was significant and the
resulting Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) statistics were higher.
In Model 2, I added indicator variables to indicate the
period in which the issue was published. There are six period
indicators here, with Period 0 referring to the years 1851 to
1874 and Period 1 to Period 5 referring to each of the other
periods as identified in Figure 2. I used the fifth period
(1950-1974) as the reference category. The results show that
being published in any other period was more hazardous than
being published in the fifth period. All coefficients, except
the Period 4 coefficient, are statistically significant. It is also
interesting to see that the magnitude of the coefficients
decreases with each consecutive period.
Next, in Model 3, I added the variable span. It records
when a newspaper enters a new category. The reason for
including this variable is that I wanted to see whether enter-
ing new categories was statistically significant or not. It is
important to note that this variable does not capture the num-
ber of categories spanned. It only captures whether the news-
paper enters a category that it had previously not included.
The result indicates that spanning new categories increases
the mortality rate, but the result is not statistically significant.
Next, I wanted to see whether the variable span was period
dependent.6 It was mentioned above that Period 1 seems to

have witnessed a rise in generalists, while the rise in special-
ists occurred in Period 5. Perhaps spanning a new category is
hazardous in the fifth period but not so in the first period. The
result shows that spanning is hazardous in both periods. In
fact, it is more hazardous in the first period than in the fifth
period, but the result is not significant. These results indicate
that entering a new category, without taking into account
whether the number of categories spanned by the newspaper
decreases, stays the same, or increases, is not significant.
Next, I decided to see whether increasing the number of cat-
egories spanned increases mortality. To do so, I created a
variable that I named catnum. This variable is set to one
when the number of categories spanned by a certain issue is
more than the number of categories spanned by the previous
issue. Otherwise it is set to zero. The result of adding this
variable is shown under Model 5 in Table 1. We see that the
coefficient is positive but that, once again, it is not statisti-
cally significant. Next, I decided to see whether the variable
catnum interacted with any certain periods. More specifi-
cally, I once again included the interaction of this variable
with the period indicators for Period 1 and Period 5. Perhaps
spanning a greater number of categories was not hazardous
in Period 1 but was hazardous in Period 5. Model 6 shows
that the coefficient of the variable has now become negative
while both interactions are positive. However, only the inter-
action with Period 5 is significant. These results indicate that
spanning more categories is not always hazardous to the
health of the organization, thus supporting Hypothesis 1.
Statistically speaking, the model shows that spanning more
categories is only hazardous in the fifth period, which is the
period of specialization. With regard to which model is a bet-
ter fit, Model 5 or Model 6, the AIC and BIC statistic give
contradicting results with the AIC favoring Model 6 while
the BIC favoring Model 5.
I have argued in this article that cluster spanning, more
than category spanning, is what is most hazardous to organi-
zational health. So far the results indicate that spanning more
categories increases mortality only in the fifth period. But
what about cluster spanning? To see the effect of cluster span-
ning on mortality rate, I created a new variable that records
whether an issue spans a different cluster than the previous
issue. To do that, I first had to determine the best-fit number
of clusters in each period. Milligan and Cooper (1985) exam-
ined 30 rules with the conclusion that while there was no
single best rule for all situations, two seemed to work most of
the time. These are the Caliski and Harabasz (1974) pseudo-
F index and the Duda-Hart index (Duda & Hart, 1973). I used
both rules to determine the optimal number of clusters for my
data set. The results are presented in Table 2.
Next, I assigned each issue in each period to one of the
groups. An issue spanned a new cluster when it was not in the
same cluster as the previous issue. So for example, if an issue
of a newspaper was in the second cluster while the next issue
was in the first cluster, I set the cluster spanning variable to 1.
If they were in the same cluster then the variable was set to 0.
Model 7 shows the result of including this variable in addition
to the variables of Model 6. The results indicate that catnum
is negative and not significant, but that its interactions with
both the Period 1 and Period 5 indicators are positive. This
means that spanning more categories increased mortality
rates in both Periods 1 and 5. The fact that spanning catego-
ries increases the hazard of mortality in Period 5 lends
support to Hypothesis 2. What is even more important for us
is that the coefficient of the binary variable which records
cluster spanning is both positive and statistically significant
indicating that spanning clusters increases mortality rates,
thus supporting Hypothesis 3. The AIC and BIC statistics
clearly favor Model 7 above all other models. It is important
to note here that a newspaper can span a different cluster
without increasing the number of categories that it spans.
What Model 7 tells us is that in such a case when catnum is
zero, cluster spanning is hazardous to the organization's mor-
tality. In addition, if an issue increases the number of catego-
ries that it spans in Period 1 or Period 5 and, by spanning
more categories, is placed in a cluster different from the pre-
vious issue, then there are two positive coefficients that will
cause an increase in the mortality rate. In other words, cate-
gory spanning captures only one hazardous dynamic while
cluster spanning captures another. Finally, to see whether the
effect of spanning clusters was period dependent, as was the
case with category spanning, I interacted the spanning vari-
able with the different time periods (results not shown in the
table). All of the interactions proved to be statistically insig-
nificant, and the resulting model was a worse fit than Model
7. This is in line with the statement in Hypothesis 3, and that
is that cluster spanning appears to be period independent.
Categories or Features?
Hannan et al. (2007) defined "a type as a coupling of a label
and a schemata that articulates a view about what pattern of
feature values determine the applicability of the label" (p. 60).
Later they stated, "We can now define a category as a type for
which an audience segment achieves a high level of exten-
sional and intensional consensus" (Hannan et al., 2007, p. 69).
What if the "categories" that were identified by this article
were nothing more than features? This would imply that the
"clusters" which were formed were actually categories, and
thus the findings of this article would be exactly in line with
present research on the effects of categories.

I wrote a program that displayed the amount of space ded-
icated to each category during the last period (1950-1974) of
this study. This is the period that saw the rise of specialists.
Specialists tend to span few categories, but they do not nec-
essarily have few features. Therefore, if my identification of
categories were correct, I would expect to see many of the
clusters formed during this last period to be populated by
newspapers that concentrate their content on a certain cate-
gory. According to the Caliski and Harabasz measures,
eight clusters is a very good fit, but not better than six, while
according to the Duda-Hart index six clusters is not a good
fit. Therefore, I chose to divide the data into eight clusters
because both measures agree that it fits the data well. I then
calculated the average proportion dedicated to each category
in each cluster. The results are presented in Table 3. In this
article, I have used the value 0.11 as the cutoff value to deter-
mine whether a newspaper issue spanned a category or not.
We can see that, except for the category "sports," every sin-
gle category was spanned by at least one cluster. We can also
see that there was always a single cluster which dedicated
more than half of its content to that category. These results
show that most of the clusters tended to dedicate the vast
majority of their contents to a single category. They also
show that each category was the center of attention of exactly
one cluster. Next, I display the correlation matrix during that
period for all categories. If these categories were in fact fea-
tures, then we would expect to see a high correlation between
some of them, if in fact organizations do form categories by
combining features. In the words of Rosch et al. (1976),
"Subordinate categories have lower total cue validity than do
basic because they also share most attributes with contrast-
ing subordinate categories" (p. 385). The correlation matrix
is displayed in Table 4. The highest positive correlation is
0.2517, which is very weak. Again, this result shows that the
categories that I identified are not features. Another impor-
tant thing to notice in the correlation matrix is that out of the
36 correlations, 27 are negative while only 9 are positive.
Again this vindicates my choice of categories because it

Implications for Future Research
The cluster spanning theory that is developed in this article
can be tested within the context of populations other than
that of the Lebanese newspaper industry. By studying clus-
ters, we would not only be studying the effects of category
spanning, but we will also be studying how organizations
group together during different periods throughout the life-
time of the industry. I believe that cluster analysis is a very
promising direction which organizational ecologists should
direct their attention to. Researchers in the field have
always had their differences with regard to how to identify
forms. This has led to huge efforts that were mostly directed
at the study of a single organizational population. In a world
in which boundaries between organizational populations
are quickly eroding due to the rise of huge corporations, it
would be useful if organizational ecologists were able to
take into account more than one population at a time.
Because cluster analysis is a multilevel approach, I believe
that it allows researchers to do exactly that. While this arti-
cle studied how clusters formed from category dynamics,
there is no reason why the same approach cannot be used to
study other levels. For example, the researcher can replace
categories with industries. This would allow him or her to
study how clusters form from the activity of organizations
in different industries. Organizational ecologists need no
longer concentrate their efforts on single industries. On the
contrary, the researcher might choose to move downward
instead of upward, in that instead of moving from catego-
ries to industries, he or she can move from categories to
features. Categories are formed from the combination of
features. A valid research agenda is to study whether the
combination of features changes over time and how do cat-
egories emerge from these combination. Again, this can be
done using the cluster analysis approach utilized in this
article due to the fact that this approach allows for two sep-
arate but related levels. The researcher need not collect data
that are continuous because various binary measures exist
in the cluster analysis literature. Therefore, the nature of the
data collected might differ from that used in this article.
The methods used in this article can be applied to other set-
tings with different sets of data, thus enabling researchers
to test the theories in a large, and diverse, number of
settings.
Conclusion
The resource partitioning theory argued that the hazards faced
by generalists and specialists are not uniform and that they
were time dependent. I tested this same idea but instead of
relying on count models that studied the number of general-
ists and specialists, and instead of classifying organizations as
generalists or specialists, I relied on the Simpson's index to
do the work for me. Next, I argued that if it were the case that
category spanning is an aspect of the resource partitioning
theory, then we would expect that the effect of category span-
ning was in fact not uniform throughout the life period of the
industry. The survival models show that category spanning is
period dependent. From there, I argued that instead of think-
ing of category spanning we should be studying what I
referred to as "cluster spanning." Clusters are formed from
the dynamics of category spanning. I argued that the act of
spanning clusters is hazardous to organizations no matter in
which time period they were active. Some category spanning
activities lead to cluster spanning activities, but there exists
some category spanning activities that do not necessarily
result in spanning a new cluster. Even more interesting is the
fact that it is possible to span a cluster even when there is no
category spanning activity. It should be noted, however, that
even when we take into account cluster spanning in the above
models, the effects of category spanning are still hazardous in
certain periods. Ultimately, in some time periods, the highest
hazard is faced by organizations that span both categories and
cluster at the same time.

Notes
1. In the management literature, companies that have a narrow
niche width offer a narrow range of products, while companies
that have a wide niche width offer a wider variety of products.
2. "In the simplest case, audience members recognize similarities
among a cluster of producers and come to regard these similar
entities as members, to varying degrees, of a common (fuzzy) set
and agree on a label for the set" (Hsu, Hannan, & Polós, 2010).
3. The grade of membership function tells to what extent the pro-
ducer possesses the membership-defining property of a par-
ticular category (Hannan, 2010).
4. In the category space, similar categories are arrayed close
to one another and dissimilar ones stand at large distances
(Kovacs & Hannan, 2009).
5. Lenient categories have lenient labels attached to them. The
expectations associated with lenient labels are not clear.
6. An important issue here is the following: When do we consider
that a newspaper has spanned a category? In the data set, there
are instances in which one newspaper issue does not dedicate
any space to literature, but in the next issue the same news-
paper dedicates just 5% to it. Should this be considered as a
case of spanning? Probably not. So what is the lower limit that
should be accepted? Because there are nine categories in total,
I took 0.11 (1/9) as the accepted limit. Randomly speaking,
an issue would dedicate 0.11 of its space to every single cat-
egory. Therefore, when a newspaper dedicates more than that
amount to a category (which would cause the space dedicated
to another category decrease to below this limit), I considered
that it spanned that category.
