Abstract
Objectives: To determine whether age, body mass index (BMI), hand length and forearm
circumference were predictive of hand grip strength in healthy Saudi Arabian adult males.
Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study recruited healthy adult male volunteers. Their
anthropometric characteristics including age, BMI, hand length and forearm circumference were
measured using routine techniques. Hand grip strength was assessed using a JamarÕ Hydraulic
Hand Dynamometer. The data were analysed using Pearson correlation coefficient (r) as well as by
a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis.
Results: The study included 116 healthy males who satisfied the inclusion criteria. A Pearson
correlation coefficient matrix demonstrated that all the four measures, age, BMI, hand length and
forearm circumference, were significantly correlated with hand grip strength. Age had an inverse
correlation with hand grip strength. The anthropometric measures of hand length, age and forearm
circumference accounted for 44.2% (R2 0.442) of the variation of the hand grip strength.
Conclusion: Hand length, age and forearm circumference significantly impacted on hand grip
strength in Saudi Arabian healthy adult males.

Introduction
Hand grip strength estimation is imperative
in determining the efficacy of treatment
strategies and hand rehabilitation. This
strength is the result of a maximum volun-
tary forceful flexion of the fingers by an
individual under normal conditions.1 Grip
strength is crucial for the human body while
performing prehensile and precision hand
functions. The human hand is a complex
structure tailored to the functions of
manipulation, and the hand conveys sensory
information to brain about temperature,
form and texture of the objects it controls.2
Grip strength has been studied as a predictor
of general health, heart disease,3 cerebro-
vascular disease,4,5 disability,4,5 cognitive
decline,4,5 future fracture risks,6,7 and mor-
tality.8,9 Many studies have correlated grip
strength with various physical variables like
nutritional status, bone mineral content,
and muscle strength.4,10 Research suggests
that there are strong correlations between
grip strength and various anthropometric
traits, such as age,11 hand length,12 body
mass index (BMI),13 and upper arm circum-
ference.14 Such correlations have been found
to exist in studies among children, adults
and aging people.15
Previously published studies have used
regression models to understand the role of
anthropometric measures in determining
hand grip strength. For example, hand
length and hand width were positively
associated with grip strength.16,17 It has
also been shown that the dominant hand
has approximately 10% stronger grip
strength than the non-dominant hand.18
Research suggests that forearm circumfer-
ence is predictive of grip strength in men but
not in women.19 A previous study proposed
that the hand circumference could be used
for predicting hand grip strength among
undergraduate students.20 In a study of the
relationship between hand grip strength and
stature, weight, arm circumferences and
subcutaneous skin folds, males attained
greater values for anthropometric variables
and greater hand grip strength values than
their female counterparts.21 Research has
been undertaken to determine the relation-
ship between forearm circumference and
grip strength among athletes and basketball
players.22,23 To date, there are mixed opin-
ions on whether anthropometric measures
can predict maximum hand grip strength.24
Hand grip strength measurement
becomes reliable only when standardized
methods and calibrated equipment are used,
even when there are different assessors or
different brands of dynamometers.25 Hand-
held dynamometers have been used to meas-
ure muscle strength, especially muscles that
are strong enough to exert force against
gravity and tolerate resistance. The JamarÕ
Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer (Patterson
Medical [formerly Sammons Preston],
Warrenville, IL, USA) was found to give
the most accurate and acceptable measures
of grip strength.26,27
From a literature review, many studies
mention various measurements such as hand
breadth, hand length, or circumferences of
the wrist and forearm as predictors of hand
grip strength, but the evidence remains
scarce and varied. For example, some
research has investigated hand grip strength
in children and adolescents,28 while other
studies have considered differences between
the dominant and non-dominant hand.18,22

strength are scarce in the Middle East.
A study that assessed the hand grip strength
in healthy adults from 21 countries found
that men in the Middle East exhibited
intermediate hand grip strength compared
with the highest levels of hand grip strength
noted among European and North
American populations.29 Other than this
recent study, there is still a dearth of avail-
able literature on hand grip strength in the
Saudi Arabian male population. Recent
studies have suggested that hand length
and forearm circumference should be stu-
died as additional factors when measuring
hand grip strength.28,30 Previous research
using predictive analyses have confirmed
hand circumference to be the most signifi-
cant predictor of grip strength.28 There are
very few studies that have compared a wide
range of age in terms of understanding the
relationship between age and hand grip
strength.4,31 There have been varied results
in the understanding of the relationship
between BMI and hand grip strength;1,10
with BMI being shown to be insignificant in
some studies of hand grip strength.12,32
This present study aimed to determine
whether age, BMI, hand length and forearm
circumference were predictive of hand grip
strength in healthy adult Saudi Arabian
males.
Patients and methods
Study population
This cross-sectional descriptive study
enrolled healthy male subjects who were
randomly recruited during the time of stu-
dent admission to King Khalid University,
Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study
was conducted by the Department of
Medical Rehabilitation Sciences, College of
Applied Medical Sciences, King Khalid
University, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia between December2015 and April
2016. Data were collected by the
Department of Physical Therapy, King
Khalid University. Inclusion criteria were
as follows: (i) aged 20­74 years; (ii) in good
health; (iii) willing to participate in the
study. Exclusion criteria were as follows:
(i) recent hand injury or surgery; (ii) hand
deformity: (iii) any oedematous, vascular, or
inflammatory condition of the hand; (iv)
neck problems.
The study received ethical approval from
the King Khalid University Ethical
Committee (registration no. Ha-06-B-001).
Healthy subjects gave written informed con-
sent after being provided with a brief
description of the study.
Anthropometric measurements
Age was recorded for each study subject.
BMI was measured using a standard digital
weighing scale and a standard height scale
and was calculated using the formula:
BMI ¼ weight (kg)/height (m)2. The forearm
girth circumference of each study subject
was measured using a flexible measuring
tape (cm) at a point 3 cm below the cubital
fossa. The point to be measured was marked
with a marker pen. The hand length was
measured from the distal crease of the wrist
to the tip of the middle finger using a flexible
measuring tape (cm).
Hand grip strength recording
Prior to the commencement of data collec-
tion, a practice trial was undertaken in order
to familiarize the subjects with the JamarÕ
Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer (Patterson
Medical [formerly Sammons Preston],
Warrenville, IL, USA). Before testing, the
examiner (V.N.K.) demonstrated how to
hold the handle of the dynamometer.
Subjects were asked to maximally squeeze
the handle of the dynamometer with their
dominant hand for 3 s and this process was
repeated for all of the handle positions. For
standardization, the third handle position
was selected on the basis of comfort and

maximum voluntary contraction. The sub-
jects were asked to sit with their shoulders in
a neutral position and the dominant arm
was positioned at the side of the body with
the elbow flexed to 90 and the wrist in a
mild ulnar deviated position. The same
instructions were given for each trial. After
the subject was positioned with the dyna-
mometer, the examiner (V.N.K.) instructed
the subject to `squeeze as hard as possible ­
hard, harder and relax'. The subjects were
provided with a rest period of 2 min to
control for the effects of fatigue. Three trials
were performed and recorded for each sub-
ject and the maximum voluntary hand grip
strength was calculated as the mean of the
three trials of grip strength for the dominant
hand.
Statistical analyses
The sample size (SS) of 115.67 was calcu-
lated using the following formula, where,
Z ¼ 1.96 at 95% confidence level, p ¼ pro-
portion of population picking a choice
(p ¼ 0.082, derived from a pilot study; 1­
p ¼ 0.918), and e2 ¼ margin of error (0.05):
SS ¼

e2
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. The mean of three consecutive
trials of hand grip strength for each subject
was used for the analyses. After establishing
normality of the data using the Shapiro­
Wilk parametric test, a stepwise multiple
linear regression analysis was used to deter-
mine the influence of anthropometric data
on hand grip strength. Pearson correlation
coefficient was used to provide a better
understanding of the relationship between
four anthropometric measures and hand
grip strength. The mean hand grip strength
value of the dominant hand was used as the
dependent variable hand grip strength
for the stepwise regression analyses. A
P-value 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
A total of 125 healthy volunteers were
screened for inclusion in the study. Of
these, seven were excluded based on the
inclusion and exclusion criteria and two
refused to participate. The remaining 116
subjects had a mean Æ SD age of
42.55 Æ 15.45 years (range, 20 ­ 74 years).
The majority of the study subjects were right
hand dominant (113; 97.4%) and three
subjects were left hand dominant (2.6%).
The anthropometric measurements are pre-
sented in Table 1.
A Pearson correlation coefficient matrix
for age, BMI, hand length, forearm circum-
ference and hand grip strength is presented

significant correlations with all four
anthropometric measurements (P 0.05).

A stepwise multiple linear regression
analysis was used to understand the predict-
ive linear trend among the independent and
dependent variables. The variables age,
BMI, forearm circumference and hand
length were entered into the equation. This
regression analysis was used to evaluate the
order of importance of the four variables
and to select the useful subset of variables in
explaining the dependent variable.33 The
regression model selected only three vari-
ables, hand length, age and forearm circum-
ference to be the significant predictors of
hand grip strength (Table 3). Hand length
was found to have a correlation with hand
grip strength indicated by R ¼ 0.500 and
accounted for 25.0% (R2 value ¼ 0.250) of
the variation in hand grip strength. Age was
the second variable selected into the regres-
sion equation, with an inverse correlation
(indicated by R ¼ 0.611 and a negative t-
value). Age accounted for an additional
12.3% (R2 change) and together with hand
length accounted for 37.3% of the variation
in hand grip strength among healthy males.
Forearm circumference accounted for an
additional 6.9% (R2 change) and together
with age and hand length accounted for
44.2% of the variation in hand grip strength.
The three variables together predicted
44.2% (R2 ¼ 0.442) of what constitutes
hand grip strength of healthy adult males
in Saudi Arabia.
Discussion
The results of the present study show that a
stronger hand grip strength is determined by
a longer hand length, a larger forearm
circumference and a younger age in Saudi

Arabian men. To the best of our knowledge,
this present study is the only one to report
the predictive relationships between hand
grip strength and the anthropometric meas-
ures under study in a Saudi Arabian popu-
lation of adult males. This present study
provides evidence that body dimensions can
influence hand grip strength, which might
have an impact on rehabilitation. The hand
length of a patient can be measured easily
and conveniently, and this can be a practical
measure for predicting hand grip strength.
The wide variation in the age of the healthy
participants in the present study provided a
better understanding of the effect of age on
hand grip strength.
The present study was designed to deter-
mine the relationship between hand grip
strength and hand dimensions using a
standardized protocol so that the predictors
of hand grip strength could be identified.
The study used the third handle position of
the JamarÕ Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer.
Grip testing is usually undertaken using the
second and third handle positions of the
JamarÕ Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer,34
but the participants in the present study
exhibited comfort and maximum hand grip
strength when using the third handle pos-
ition. Because of the difference in hand size,
women tend to exhibit their greatest grip
strengths with the handle in the second
position, whereas the third handle position
is usually the most advantageous for men.35
A Pearson correlation coefficient matrix
for age, BMI, hand length, forearm circum-
ference and hand grip strength demonstrated
that the five anthropometric measures had
correlations with each other, except for age,
which was not correlated with BMI and
forearm circumference. All four anthropo-
metric measures had significant correlations
with hand grip strength. An earlier study
found that only hand circumference had a
significant impact on hand grip strength.20
Another study conducted in Malaysia found
that forearm circumference and hand length
were systematically selected in a regression
model predicting hand grip.24 Hand length
was found to be the most significant con-
tributor to hand grip strength in the present
study, accounting for 25% of the variation in
the hand grip strength. Previous research
demonstrated that hand length had a signifi-
cant impact on the grip strength.29 Men are
found to have longer hands when compared
with women.7 Dominant right hand grip
strength was found to be strongly associated
with hand length, hand width, and forearm
girth, but was not associated with height,
weight and BMI in healthy Indian collegiate
females aged 18­25 years.22 Since the hand
length measured in the present study also
measured the middle finger length (distal
crease), the variable hand length could
encompass a more predictive power when
measuring hand grip strength.
In the present study, hand grip strength
was inversely associated with age and the
relationship was likely caused by a decline
in musculoskeletal strength and muscle
mass with increasing age. There might
also have been reduced steadiness of the
hand among the older participants com-
pared with younger participants, which
could have led to reduced hand grip
strength in this present study. The mean
age of the participants in this present study
was 42.55 years and the majority were
older than 31 years (n ¼ 91), which might
explain the inverse correlation with age.
Prior research has demonstrated that hand
grip strength showed a significant correl-
ation with age when measured using a
JamarÕ Smart Hand Dynamometer.36
Forearm circumference provides the most
practical index of hand grip strength related
to muscle mass, and was the most significant
predictor of hand grip strength in several
studies.20,25 In the stepwise multiple linear
regression equation in the present study,
forearm circumference was found to con-
tribute only 6.9% to hand grip strength,
making it the third and last predictor.
Alahmari et al. 545
The muscles used to produce grip force are
predominantly located in the forearm and
would be heavily influenced by the amount
of fat.37 In this present study, there is a high
correlation between BMI and forearm cir-
cumference (r ¼ 0.680), indicating that the
hand size of the participants was higher.
Since the majority of the population lies in
the overweight and obese categories,15 this
could be the reason why the forearm cir-
cumference was found to have a lower
regression value of 6.9% on hand grip
strength in this Saudi Arabian population.
Fat-free cross-sectional area is found to be
highly correlated with hand grip strength.20
In a recent study comparing the global hand
grip strength, the BMI of Middle Eastern
men was 27.0 Æ 4.82 kg/m2, indicating that
there was a higher number of overweight
individuals in the Middle East when com-
pared with Asian, Chinese and African male
populations.29
In the present study, BMI demonstrated
a positive correlation with hand grip
strength, but it was excluded from the
stepwise regression model. The reason for
the exclusion would be the lack of partici-
pants in the lowest BMI category (n ¼ 0;
<18.5 kg/m2). BMI and hand grip strength
research has provided conflicting findings.
For example, elderly individuals with
normal BMI show positive correlations,
whereas in adults aged 25­70 years in the
overweight and obese ranges, BMI was
correlated with a lower hand grip
strength.10,32 This could also be the reason
why in the Pearson correlation coefficient
matrix in the present study, age was not
significantly correlated with BMI.
In the present study, hand length was
found to be the most significant variable in
predicting hand grip strength among Saudi
Arabian men. Hand length, age and forearm
girth circumference predicted 44.2% of
hand grip strength in the Saudi Arabian
men in this present study. This result concurs
with earlier studies, which demonstrated
that hand length and forearm circum-
ference contributed to 23% of hand grip
strength.24,38 The present study demon-
strated a higher R2 value (0.44) when
compared with previous research,24 but it
was still <50%, which reduced the predictive
capacity of the overall model.
The study had several limitations. First,
the small sample size, lack of female partici-
pants and the wide age range makes it
difficult to make generalizations based on
the findings. Secondly, a better prediction
model could have been obtained if the study
had taken account of the dominant hand,
physical activity of the participant, hand
problems and muscle mass. Thirdly, the
cross-sectional nature of this study cannot
determine the longitudinal course of indi-
vidual grip strengths. Future research could
also determine if palm width, middle finger
length, shoulder position, joint position,
thumb position and body posture impact
on the hand grip strength.
In conclusion, the present study provides
a sample of healthy adult male data on hand
grip strength for clinical use and hand
rehabilitation. It explored the relationship
between grip strength and hand length, age
and forearm circumference. Hand length
and forearm circumference should be con-
sidered for hand grip strength measurements
in the older age group since these anthropo-
metric measures could impact on the results
of therapy and influence hand function
training.
