Introduction
Esophagus and lung cancers are thoracic cancers. Human
lung cancers are classified into 2 major types: small-cell
lung cancer (SCLC) and non­small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC); the latter is the most common type.1 Lung cancer
remains the most lethal malignancy. The incidence of
esophageal cancer is relatively low when compared with
that of lung cancer; however, its survival rate is poor.2 Thus,
the development of agents with inhibitory effect against
esophagus cancer cells warrants attention.
Rotundic acid (RA; Figure 1) is a pentacyclic triterpenic
acid naturally occurring in many medicinal plants such
as Mussaenda macrophylla, olive (Olea europaea), and
Glochidion obliquum.3-5 It is reported that this triterpenic
acid could exhibit cytotoxic activities toward human hepato-
cellular carcinoma (HepG2), malignant melanoma (A375),
SCLC (NCI-H446), breast cancer (MCF-7), and colon can-
cer (HT-29) cell lines.6,7 These studies implied that this trit-
erpenic acid was a potent anticancer agent. However, it is
unknown if RAcould inhibit the growth of esophagus cancer
and/or NSCLC cells. OE33, a human esophageal squamous
cancer cell line, and A549, a NSCLC cell line, have been
widely used to investigate the apoptotic effects and possible
mechanism of certain compounds against esophagus cancer
and NSCLC.8,9 In the present study, both cancer cell lines
were also used to examine the cytotoxic potential and action
mode of RA at various concentrations.
Cancer cell death could be induced by activating the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This pathway is mainly
mediated by BCL family of proteins, in which the expres-
sion of apoptotic factors such as Bax is increased and/or
the expression of antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 is
decreased.10 The changes in these proteins trigger perme-
abilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane of cancer
cells, which causes the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP),11 enhances the release of cytochrome c

Apoptotic Effects of Rotundic Acid on
Human Esophagus and Lung Cancer Cells
Yu-sen Lin, MD1,2, Lihong Hu, PhD3, and Mei-chin Yin, PhD4,5
Abstract
Rotundic acid (RA) is a pentacyclic triterpenic acid. Apoptotic effects of RA at 4, 8, or 16 µM in OE33 and A549 cell lines,
an esophageal squamous cancer cell line and a non­small-cell lung cancer cell line, were examined. RA at 4 to 16 µM
inhibited the survival of both cell lines. RA at 8 and 16 µM decreased Bcl-2 expression and at 4 to 16 µM upregulated Bax
and cleaved caspase-3 expression. RA treatments decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in those cells. RA at 4 to 16 µM lowered
Na+-K+-ATPase activity and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in OE33 and A549 cells. RA at 8 and 16 µM
enhanced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression in OE33 cells. In A549 cells, RA increased caspase-3
expression in a concentration-dependent manner; but only at 8 and 16 µM, it upregulated caspase-9 expression. RA
treatments at 4 to 16 µM decreased protein kinase c activity, suppressed the expression of cytochrome c and apoptosis-
inducing factor, and lowered the production of reactive oxygen species, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming
growth factor-1, and tumor necrosis factor- in both cell lines. RA at 8 and 16 µM downregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-
1 expression. These findings suggest that RA could penetrate into OE33 and A549 cells and execute cytotoxic activities.

and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and activates the mito-
chondria-derived caspase cascade, such as caspase-3 and
caspase-9.12,13 These events eventually lead to cancer cell
death. In addition, Na+-K+-ATPase, a key enzyme in the tri-
carboxylic acid cycle, is a transmembrane protein respon-
sible for exchanging intracellular Na+ for extracellular K+.14
Abnormality in this enzyme disturbs ion homeostasis and
impairs mitochondrial functions. So far, little information
is available regarding the influence of RA on the variation
of Bcl-2, Bax, MMP, caspases, cytochrome c, and Na+-K+-
ATPase activity in OE33 and A549 cells.
Malignant tumor growth creates a hypoxic environment
because of insufficient blood supply, which stimulates reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production and hypoxia-inducible fac-
tor (HIF)-1 expression.15,16 Increased HIF-1 in turn acti-
vates protein kinase c (PKC) and promotes tumor proliferation
and differentiation.16,17 Furthermore, greater HIF-1 facili-
tates the transcription of several genes encoding for angiogenic
and autocrine growth factors, including vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-1,
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, which consequently bene-
fits the progression of cancer cell angiogenesis and metasta-
sis.18,19 Thus, if RA could decrease the production of these
factors, it might provide more efficient anticancer activities.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
RA (98.5%) was obtained from Shanghai Institute of
Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.
Medium, chemicals, plates, and antibiotics used for cell cul-
ture were purchased from Difco Laboratory (Detroit, MI).
Cell Culture
Normal human esophagus cell (Het-1A), normal human
bronchial epithelial cell (BEAS-2B), and OE33 and 549 cell
lines were bought from American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium, which contained 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL
of penicillin, and 100 U/mL of streptomycin (pH 7.4) at
37°C in 5% CO
2
. The culture medium was refreshed every
3 days, and cells were subcultured every week. Phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) was added to adjust the cell
number to 105/mL for experiments and analyses.
Experimental Design
Stock solution of RA was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and diluted with medium. The final DMSO con-
centration in medium was 0.1%. DMSO at this concentration
did not affect cell viability and other measurements (data
not shown). Test cells (105/mL) were treated with RA at 0
(control), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 µM for 48 hours at 37°C,
which resulted in 95.9% ± 1.5% incorporation of RA.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay
MTT assay was done to examine cell viability. After RA
treatment, cells were incubated with 0.25 mg MTT/mL for
3 hours at 37°C. The amount of MTT formazan product was
determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a
Bio-Rad microplate reader (Hercules, CA), with 630 nm as
a reference. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of
control groups.
Measurement of MMP
MMP was assayed by flow cytometry (Beckman-FC500,
Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and the fluorescent dye
rhodamine 123 (Rh123) was purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co (St Louis, MO). Cells were suspended in
RPMI 1640 medium. Rh123 (100 µg/L) was added into cell
medium and followed by incubation for 45 minutes at 37°C.
After washing twice with PBS, the mean fluorescence
intensity was analyzed.
Preparation of Mitochondrial Fractions
Control or treated cells were lysed in 5 mL cold lysis buffer
containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 mM EDTA (ethyl-
enediaminetetraacetic acid), 1.5 mM MgCl
2
, 10 mM KCl,
1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 1 mM DTT
(dithiothreitol), and 0.6% Nonidet P-40 for 30 minutes.
After centrifuging at 200g for 10 minutes at 4°C, the super-
natant was collected and further centrifuged at 10000g for
20 minutes at 4°C to obtain mitochondria pellet. This pellet
was then resuspended in PBS. Protein concentration of
the mitochondrial fraction was determined by an assay kit
(Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, IL).
Na+-K+-ATPase Activity Assay
Na+-K+-ATPase activity was assayed by measuring the
amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) released from ATP.20
The reaction mixture contained 100 mmol/L NaCl, 20
mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L ATP, 30 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 7.4), and the freshly isolated cellular mitochondria.
This assay was initiated by adding ATP and terminated by
adding 15% trichloroacetic acid after 15 minutes of incuba-
tion at 37°C. The released Pi was quantified by measuring
the absorbance at 640 nm. The value was expressed as a
percentage of control groups.

Determination of DNA Fragmentation
A commercial ELISA plus kit (Roche Molecular Bio-
chemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was used to measure
DNA fragmentation. After incubation with RA at various
concentrations, cells were lysed for 30 minutes at room
temperature and followed by centrifugation at 200g for 10
minutes. Then, 20 µL supernatant was transferred onto the
streptavidin-coated plate, and 80 µL freshly prepared immu-
noreagent was added into each well and followed by incu-
bation for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing with
PBS, the substrate solution was added and then incubated
for 15 minutes. The absorbance at 405 nm (reference wave-
length 490 nm) was measured using a microplate reader.
DNA fragmentation was expressed as the enrichment
factor using the following equation: enrichment factor =
(Absorbance of RA treated cells)/(Absorbance of controls).
Measurement of ROS, TNF-, TGF-1, and VEGF
ROS level was measured by 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diace-
tate (DCFH-DA). Cell homogenate at 100 µL was reacted
with 100 µL DCFH-DA (2 mg/mL) for 30 minutes at 37°C.
Fluorescence values were determined by a fluorescence
plate reader with 488 nm excitation and 525 nm emission.
The result was expressed as relative fluorescence unit
(RFU)/mg protein. The levels of TNF-, TGF-1, and
VEGF in cell culture supernatant were measured using
ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
PKC Activity Assay
PKC activity was determined by a peptide pseudosubstrate,
which could be phosphorylated by PKC.21 In brief, cell pellets
were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and suspended in 1 mL
cold buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM -
mercaptoethanol, 10 mM EGTA [ethyleneglycoltetraacetic
acid], 10 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM PMSF; pH 7.5). After
centrifugation, protein concentration was determined. PKC
activity was assayed by a protein kinase assay kit (EMD Bio-
sciences, Darmstadt, Germany). Color intensity was measured
at 492 nm, and the relative kinase activity was calculated.
Western Blot Analyses
Cells were suspended in lysis buffer, and protein content was
determined. Sample at 40 µg protein was applied to 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for
1 hour. After blocking with a solution containing 5% non-
fat milk for 1 hour, the membrane was incubated with
mouse anticleaved caspase-3, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax (1:2000),
anti­caspase-3, anti­caspase-9, anticytochrome c, anti-AIF
(1:1000), and anti-HIF-1 (1:500) monoclonal antibody
(Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at 4°C over-
night and followed by reaction with horseradish peroxidase
conjugated antibody for 2 hours. The detected bands were
quantified by Scion Image analysis software (Scion Corp,
Frederick, MD), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-
genase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control. The blot was
imaged by autoradiography and normalized to GAPDH.
Statistical Analysis
The effect of each treatment was analyzed from 10 different
preparations (n = 10). Data were reported as means ± SD
and subjected to analysis of variance. Differences among
means were determined by the least significance difference
test, with significance defined at P <.05.
Results
RA Decreased Cancer Cell Viability
RA treatments at 0.5 to 16 µM did not affect the viability of
Het-1A and BEAS-2B cells and normal human esophagus
and bronchial epithelial cell lines (Figure 2, P > .05). RA
treatments at 0.5, 1, and 2 µM did not affect the viability of
OE33 and A549 cells and esophagus and lung cancer cell
lines. However, RA at 4 to 16 µM inhibited the survival of
both cell lines (P < .05) in a concentration-dependent man-
ner. After calculation, the values of IC
50
of RA for OE33
and A549 cells were 6.7 and 8.3 µM, respectively. In OE33
cells, RA at 4 to 16 µM decreased Bcl-2 expression and
increased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3
(Figure 3, P < .05), and Bax expression was enhanced in a

concentration-dependent manner (P < .05). In A549 cells,
RA at 8 and 16 µM suppressed Bcl-2 expression (P < .05)
and, at 4 to 16 µM, upregulated Bax and cleaved caspase-3
expression (P < .05). RA at 4 to 16 µM decreased the ratio
of Bcl-2/Bax in both cell lines (P < .05).
RA Impaired Mitochondrial and DNA Stabilities
As shown in Table 1, RA at 4 to 16 µM reduced MMP
in OE33 and A549 cells (P < .05) in a concentration-
dependent manner. RA at these concentrations, without a
concentration-dependent effect, also lowered Na+-K+-ATPase
activity in both cell lines (P < .05). RA only at 8 and 16 µM
raised DNA fragmentation in OE33 and A549 cells
(P < .05). As shown in Figure 4, RA at 8 and 16 µM upregu-
lated caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression in OE33 cells
(P < .05). In A549 cells, RA enhanced caspase-3 expression
in a concentration-dependent manner but increased caspase-9
expression only at 8 and 16 µM (P < .05). RA treatments at
4 to 16 µM decreased PKC activity in both cell lines, and
a concentration-dependent effect appeared in A549 cells
(Figure 5, P < .05).
RA Suppressed Cytochrome c, AIF, and HIF-1
Expression
As shown in Figure 6, RA at 4 to 16 µM suppressed cyto-
chrome c and AIF expression in both cell lines (P < .05),
and a concentration-dependent effect was observed in
decreasing AIF expression in OE33 cells (P < .05). RA at 8
and 16 µM downregulated HIF-1 expression in both cell
lines (P < .05). RA at 4 to 16 µM lowered ROS, TNF-,
VEGF, and TGF-1 levels in OE33 and A549 cells (Table 2,
P < .05), in which a concentration-dependent effect was
seen in the reduction of ROS, VEGF, and TGF-1 levels in
OE33 cells.
Discussion
The cytotoxic effects of RA against liver, breast, and colon
cancer cells have been reported.6,7 Our present study
extended the inhibitory activity of this triterpenic acid
toward OE33 and A549 cells, esophagus cancer, and
NSCLC cells. Our data revealed that RA suppressed
protein expression of Bcl-2 and HIF-1, lowered MMP,
increased DNA fragmentation, promoted caspase activa-
tion, and decreased VEGF and TGF-1 production in both
cancer cell lines, which consequently led to cell apoptosis.
These novel findings prove that RA was a potent agent
against esophagus cancer and NSCLC. In addition, RA at
test concentrations did not affect the survival of normal
human esophagus and bronchial, Het-1A, and BEAS-2B
cells. Thus, the application of RA for esophagus or lung
cancer prevention or therapy might be safe.
Apoptosis could be induced through the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway. We found that RA lowered Bcl-2 expres-
sion, increased Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression, and
decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in OE33 and A549 cells.
Obviously, the apoptotic action of RA in these 2 cancer cell
lines was a result of its induction of the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway via decreasing antiapoptotic defense
and increasing apoptotic action. DNA fragmentation is a
marker of cell rupture and death. Our data indicated that
RA treatments led to greater DNA fragmentation in OE33
and A549 cells. These results suggested that RA could pen-
etrate into these cells, disrupt plasma membrane integrity,
and cause DNA damage. Na+-K+-ATPase is a transmem-
brane protein responsible for the maintenance of Na+-K+
ion homeostasis. Abnormality in this enzyme led to the loss
of MMP and the release of caspases.22,23 The presence of
RA markedly reduced Na+-K+-ATPase activity and MMP
in both cell lines. Thus, the observed cytotoxic activity of
RA could be partially ascribed to this compound impairing
mitochondrial stability and functions. RA treatments also
effectively upregulated the expression of caspase-9 and
caspase-3, an upstream initiator and a downstream effector,
in the caspase cascade. The activation of these caspases
further mediates gene expression and signal transduction,
which consequently promotes proteolytic cleavage, DNA
damage, and cell death. These findings indicated that RA
was able to activate both upstream and downstream cas-
pases in OE33 and A549 cells and facilitated apoptotic
reactions in these cancer cells. In addition, both caspase-9
and caspase-3 are involved in death signal transduction
in the death receptor pathway.24 Thus, it is possible that
RA-induced apoptosis in both cancer cell lines was
partially a result of its activation of this death receptor
pathway.

PKC activation stimulates tumor cell signaling path-
ways, such as the Ras kinase pathway, and favors tumor
proliferation and progression.25 It is reported that PKC
inhibitors benefited the induction of lung and esophagus
cancer cell apoptosis.26,27 In our study, PKC activity in
OE33 and A549 cells was substantially diminished by RA
treatments at 4 to 16 µM. The inhibitory effects of RA on
PKC activation in those cells might contribute to retarding
esophagus cancer and NSCLC progression via decreasing
associated pathways. Both cytochrome c and AIF play
important roles in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and
cell survival.28,29 It is reported that increased AIF enhanced
tumor differentiation in esophageal squamous cell carci-
noma.30 Thus, the lower protein expression of cytochrome c
and AIF after RA treatments that we observed implied that
the mitochondrial respiratory chain of OE33 and A549 cells
was damaged. These data once again prove that RA could
cause mitochondrial malfunctions in those cells. HIF-1
regulates the essential adaptive process for cancer cells to
the hypoxic microenvironment, the major pathophysiological
condition for cancer progression.15 HIF-1 overexpression
was a predictive factor for poor prognosis or worse survival
rate for NSCLC and esophagus cancer patients.31,32 Thus,

the suppressive effects of RA on HIF-1 expression in both
OE33 and A549 cells shows that this compound could
weaken the adaptability of these cancer cells to hypoxic con-
ditions, which in turn decreased the survival and metastasis
of these cells. Furthermore, HIF-1 is a transcriptional fac-
tor for VEGF expression.33 Because RA treatments already
downregulated HIF-1 expression in both cancer cell lines,
the lower VEGF generation in these cells could be explained.
ROS is an oxidant, and TNF- is an inflammatory medi-
ator. Both VEGF and TGF-1 are angiogenic factors.
Increased ROS, TNF-, VEGF, and TGF-1 production
enhance oxidative and inflammatory stress, which benefits
microvascular permeability and cancer metastasis. Saji
et al34 indicated that TGF-1, via its immunosuppressive
effect, promoted pulmonary metastasis in NSCLC patients.
von Rahden et al35 reported that TGF-1 overexpression
was highly associated with poor prognosis in patients with
esophagus cancer. Thus, the lower production of ROS,
TNF-, VEGF, and TGF-1 in RA-treated OE33 and A549
cells suggested that angiogenic and metastatic actions in
these cancer cells were diminished. These findings imply
that RA might provide antiangiogenic and antimetastatic
activities in these cancer cells by decreasing oxidative,
inflammatory, and angiogenic stress. RA is a natural com-
pound present in many edible plant foods or herbs such as
G obliquum, O europaea, Ilex integra, and Randia for-
mosa.4,5 Its natural property could enhance its use for dis-
ease prevention or therapy. However, the information
regarding the in vivo activity and bioavailability of this
compound is limited. Thus, further in vivo studies are nec-
essary to verify and ensure the safety and efficiency of RA.
In summary, RA treatments at 4 to 16 µM induced apop-
tosis in OE33 andA549 cells. This triterpenic acid increased
DNA fragmentation, decreased MMP and Na+-K+-ATPase
activity, and lowered VEGF and TGF-1 production in
these cancer cells. This agent also effectively suppressed
protein expression of Bcl-2, HIF-1, and cytochrome c.
These findings suggest that RA is a potent agent against
esophagus and lung cancers.
