Ascorbic Acid and Bone Mineral Density Simon and Hudes
Relation of Ascorbic Acid to Bone Mineral Density and Self-reported
Fractures among US Adults
Joel A. Simon1,2 and Esther S. Hudes2
Ascorbic acid is an essential nutrient involved in collagen formation, and its deficiency is associated with
abnormal bone development.To examine the relation of ascorbic acid to bone mineral density and the prevalence
of self-reported fractures, the authors analyzed data collected from 13,080 adults enrolled in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) during 1988­1994. Because they identified three-way
interactions among smoking, history of estrogen use, and dietary and serum ascorbic acid in postmenopausal
women, they analyzed these relations stratified by smoking and estrogen use. Dietary ascorbic acid intake was
independently associated with bone mineral density among premenopausal women (p = 0.002). Among men,
serum ascorbic acid was associated in a nonlinear fashion with bone mineral density (p < 0.05), and dietary
ascorbic acid intake was associated in a nonlinear fashion with self-reported fracture (p = 0.05). Among
postmenopausal women without a history of smoking or estrogen use, serum ascorbic acid was unexpectedly
associated with lower bone mineral density (p = 0.01). However, among postmenopausal women with a history
of smoking and estrogen use, a standard deviation increase in serum ascorbic acid was associated with a 49%
decrease in fracture prevalence (p = 0.001). Dietary and serum ascorbic acid measures were associated
inconsistently with bone mineral density and self-reported fracture among adult participants in NHANES III.

Osteoporosis, affecting both women and men, is highly
prevalent among older Americans and is an important risk
factor for clinical fractures (1). A number of dietary factors
have been identified as associated with bone mineral density
including calcium, vitamin D, caffeine, and alcohol.
Ascorbic acid deficiency has been associated with decreased
bone density in a few experimental animal studies (2, 3). In
animals, such deficiency affects vitamin D metabolism and,
in turn, the risk of osteoporosis (4). In humans, some obser-
vational studies (5­12), but not all (13), have reported an
association between ascorbic acid intake or blood levels and
bone mineral density. Although marked abnormalities in
bone metabolism and growth have been described among
children with scurvy (14), the relation of ascorbic acid to
bone density over a wide range of intakes and blood levels
has not been examined among a representative sample of the
US population.
We undertook this study to examine whether dietary
ascorbic acid intake and serum ascorbic acid levels were
associated with bone mineral density and the prevalence of
self-reported fractures among participants in the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III). We were specifically interested in whether
low serum ascorbic acid levels (<0.2 mg/dl) (15) were a risk
factor for low bone mineral density. Because other investiga-
tors have described possible interactions between ascorbic
acid and calcium intake (11), smoking (12), and post-
menopausal estrogen therapy (10) on bone mineral density or
fracture, we also were interested in exploring whether these
factors modified the association between ascorbic acid, bone
mineral density, and self-reported fractures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
NHANES III was a national probability survey of approx-
imately 40,000 Americans conducted between 1988 and
1994 that used a stratified, cluster sampling design to over-
sample populations of special interest (16). Participants aged
from 2 months to > 90 years were enrolled, interviewed, and
examined by study personnel (16). Our analysis used data
from the examination, laboratory, and adult participant files.
A total of 17,705 participants had at least some information
in all three files. Complete data from 6,943 women and 6,137
men between the ages of 20 and 90 years were available for
428 Simon and Hudes

analyses examining the relation of ascorbic acid to self-
reported fracture, representing approximately 86 percent of
the total number of adult participants with valid serum ascor-
bic acid values. Because not all these adult participants
obtained bone mineral density measurements, analyses
examining the relation of ascorbic acid to bone mineral den-
sity were possible for 3,204 premenopausal women, 2,906
postmenopausal women, and 5,739 men representing 78 per-
cent of the total number of adult participants with valid
serum ascorbic acid values. NHANES III recorded subjects
>90 years as being aged 90. A total of 25 participants with
extremely high serum ascorbic acid levels (>170 µmol/liter
(3.0 mg/dl)) were excluded because such values were
deemed of questionable validity (15). Participants were
excluded if there were missing data on variables judged to be
potential predictors of bone mineral density or if outcome
data on bone mineral density were unavailable. Comparison
of participants included in analyses examining history of
fracture with participants excluded for missing data revealed
that both groups were similar demographically, but excluded
participants were, on average, 3 years older, more likely
women (55 percent vs. 52 percent), to have attained a lower
level of education (11.6 years vs. 12.4 years), and more likely
non-White (86 percent vs. 81 percent).
Measurements
NHANES III questionnaire data included self-reported
age; race (categorized as White, Black, other); sex; years of
education completed; level of leisure time physical activity;
history of smoking; diabetes mellitus; level of alcohol
intake; menopausal status; use of diuretic, cholesterol-
lowering, and estrogen-containing medications; and dietary
intake (16). We considered women to be postmenopausal if
1) they were aged 55 years or if 2) they were younger than
55 years, had a uterus and at least one ovary, were not preg-
nant or breastfeeding, and reported no menstrual period dur-
ing the prior 12 months. Quantitative nutrition data were
collected using a 24-hour dietary recall. Because quantita-
tive data on vitamin supplement use were not available,
intake estimates were based solely on the 24-hour diet
recall. Body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) was pro-
vided in the data set to the nearest tenth and was entered into
all models in that fashion. The questionnaires, dietary meth-
ods, and examination procedures used in NHANES III have
been described in detail (16).
Serum ascorbic acid and serum vitamin E (-tocopherol)
levels were measured at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention by isocratic high performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (17). Serum ascorbic acid levels ranged from 0.0 to
the upper cutpoint of 170 µmol/liter (3.0 mg/dl). Bone min-
eral density measurements of the proximal femur were made
using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. We used the bone
mineral density estimates from the total proximal femoral
region for these analyses. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
scans were reviewed at the Mayo Clinic for quality control
(16). We ascertained whether participants had a history of
clinical fracture by a positive response to the following
questions: "Has a doctor ever told you that you had broken
or fractured your hip, wrist, or spine?" (16). Radiographs of
the vertebral spine were not obtained.
Statistical methods
To account for all exclusions in a consistent fashion, we
used unweighted numbers when reporting the starting sam-
ple sizes, exclusions, and final sample sizes in each of the
three sex-stratified groups (premenopausal women, post-
menopausal women, and men) and for the number of
fracture events. All prevalence rates, means, and standard
deviations are reported using sample weights. We used age-
and multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression to
examine the associations of dietary and serum ascorbic
acid level with bone mineral density and with prevalence
of self-reported fracture among the three sex-stratified
groups. All the analyses take into account the complex sur-
vey design of NHANES III. The level of physical activity
was analyzed as an ordinal variable. The multivariate mod-
els included age; race; level of education; physical activity;
body mass index; cigarette smoking; alcohol consumption;
thiazide diuretic use; diabetes mellitus; serum levels of
vitamin D, vitamin E, and thyroid-stimulating hormone;
and dietary intake of calories, fat, protein, calcium, and
caffeine. For premenopausal women, oral contraceptive
use, history of pregnancy, and number of livebirths were
also entered into the models. Among postmenopausal
women, we identified interactions among smoking, estro-
gen use, and bone mineral density/fracture by including
cross-product terms in linear and logistic regression mod-
els. We tested for but did not find an interaction among
dietary calcium intake, ascorbic acid, and bone mineral
density/fractures. All the variables included in the models
have been reported, in at least some studies, to be associ-
ated with bone mineral density. Serum vitamin E was
included in the multivariate models because it an important
antioxidant nutrient often correlated with ascorbic acid
intake and may be itself a predictor of bone mineral den-
sity. We tested for nonlinear relations by including linear
and quadratic terms for dietary and serum ascorbic acid.
For men, the figures examining the relation of serum ascor-
bic acid to bone mineral density and the relation of dietary
ascorbic acid to self-reported fractures are based on multi-
variate linear and logistic regression models, respectively.
We plotted predicted bone mineral density as a function of
serum ascorbic acid level (within each 0.1-mg/dl increment
of serum ascorbic acid) and predicted prevalence of self-
reported fracture as a function of dietary ascorbic acid
intake (in 1-mg/day increments). These predicted values
were then smoothed using a locally weighted symmetric
nearest neighbor linear smoother (18, 19) that allows for
the use of sample weights (20, 21).
Analyses were performed using Stata Corporation soft-
ware that included commands for the analysis of complex
survey data (22). For each predictor variable, we calculated
slopes (for bone mineral density) and odds ratios (for self-
reported fractures) with corresponding 95 percent confi-
dence intervals. We considered two-tailed p values of <0.05
to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of 6,943 women and 6,137
men, aged 20­90 years and enrolled in NHANES III with
complete data available for these analyses, are presented in
table 1. A total of 186 premenopausal women (7 percent), 392
postmenopausal women (13 percent), and 649 men (12 per-
cent) reported a history of one or more fractures. Of these par-
ticipants, 6 percent of premenopausal women, 18 percent of
postmenopausal women, and 7 percent of men reported a hip
fracture; 84 percent of premenopausal women, 74 percent of
postmenopausal women, and 81 percent of men reported a
wrist fracture; and 12 percent of premenopausal women, 18
percent of postmenopausal women, and 16 percent of men
reported a vertebral fracture. On average, men had higher
caloric intakes; greater dietary consumption of fat, protein,
alcohol, and caffeine; and greater bone mineral density mea-
surements. We also examined whether the percentage of calo-
ries from fat and protein differed among the three groups.
There was no significant difference between premenopausal
women and men in the percentage of calories consumed from
fat or protein (both p > 0.05), but postmenopausal women con-
sumed a slightly smaller percentage of calories from fat (p <
0.01) and a slightly larger percentage of calories from protein
compared with men (p < 0.001). Standard deviations for serum
ascorbic acid level were approximately 0.4­0.5 mg/dl for the
three groups. The correlation coefficients between serum
ascorbic acid and dietary ascorbic acid ranged from 0.26 to
0.29 among the three groups (all p < 0.001). The correlations
between bone mineral density and self-reported fracture (ana-
lyzed as a dichotomous variable) were ­0.02 among pre-
menopausal women (p  0.46), ­0.14 among postmenopausal
women (p < 0.001), and ­0.05 among men (p  0.07).
Premenopausal women
Among premenopausal women, increasing levels of dietary
ascorbic acid were independently associated with bone min-
eral density; each 100-mg/day increase in dietary ascorbic acid
was independently associated with an increase of 0.01 g/cm2
in total hip bone mineral density (p  0.002) (table 2). Serum
ascorbic acid, however, was not associated with bone mineral
density and neither dietary ascorbic acid nor serum ascorbic
acid was associated with self-reported fracture (all p > 0.55).

Postmenopausal women
In analyses unstratified by smoking status and use of estro-
gen-containing medication, neither dietary ascorbic acid
intake nor serum ascorbic acid was associated with bone min-
eral density or self-reported fracture (all p  0.35) (tables 2
and 3). Because we detected significant three-way interac-
tions with smoking and use of estrogen-containing medica-
tion, additional analyses examining the relation of ascorbic
acid to bone mineral density and self-reported fractures were
conducted stratified by smoking history (ever vs. never) and
history of postmenopausal estrogen use (ever vs. never).
Among postmenopausal women who had no history of smok-
ing or estrogen use, serum ascorbic acid levels were inversely
associated with bone mineral density; each standard deviation
(0.49 mg/dl) increase was associated with a 0.01-g/cm2
decrease in total hip bone mineral density (p < 0.05) (table 4).
Neither dietary ascorbic acid intake nor serum ascorbic acid
levels among the other subgroups of postmenopausal women
were associated with bone mineral density, although dietary
ascorbic acid intake was marginally associated with increased
bone mineral density among smokers without a history of
postmenopausal estrogen use (p  0.05). In analyses exam-
ining the relation of ascorbic acid to prevalence of self-
reported fractures, each standard deviation increase in serum
ascorbic acid levels in postmenopausal women with a history

of both smoking and estrogen use was independently associ-
ated with a 49 percent lower prevalence of fractures (p 
0.001) (table 5). Otherwise, dietary ascorbic acid intake and
serum ascorbic acid levels were not significantly associated
with prevalence of self-reported fracture.
Men
Among men, serum ascorbic acid levels were associated
in a nonlinear fashion with bone mineral density (p < 0.05);
predicted bone mineral density peaked at serum ascorbic
acid levels between 0.5 mg/dl and 1 mg/dl and declined
gradually at higher serum ascorbic acid levels (figure 1).
Dietary ascorbic acid intake was associated in a nonlinear
fashion with self-reported fracture (p  0.01) (figure 2). A
dietary ascorbic acid intake of approximately 200 mg/day
was associated with the lowest prevalence of self-reported
fractures. At ascorbic acid intakes less than approximately
100 mg/day and greater than 250 mg/day, the prevalence of
self-reported fractures among men rose. We specifically
found that low serum ascorbic acid levels (<0.2 mg/dl) were
associated with lower bone mineral density levels (p < 0.01)
and with a nonsignificant 24 percent increased prevalence of
self-reported fractures (p  0.22).
DISCUSSION
Our principal findings were 1) among premenopausal
women, dietary ascorbic acid was associated with greater
bone mineral density in a linear fashion; 2) among post-
menopausal women with a history of smoking and estrogen
use, serum ascorbic acid was associated with a marked
decreased prevalence of self-reported fractures but, unex-

physical activity; body mass index; use of thiazide diuretics; dietary
intake of calories, fat, protein, calcium, caffeine, and alcohol; history
of smoking (never/past/current); history of diabetes; and serum lev-
els of thyroid-stimulating hormone, vitamin D, and vitamin E.
Multivariate analyses revealed significant linear and quadratic terms
for serum ascorbic acid (p < 0.05).

pectedly, was also associated with lower bone mineral den-
sity among postmenopausal women without a history of
either smoking or estrogen use; and 3) among men, serum
ascorbic acid and dietary ascorbic acid were associated in a
nonlinear fashion with bone mineral density and self-
reported fracture, respectively.
On the basis of the observation that ascorbic acid is a nutri-
ent essential for collagen formation and normal bone develop-
ment (14), we hypothesized that ascorbic acid status would be
associated with bone mineral density. In the guinea pig, ascor-
bic acid deficiency results in decreased collagen synthesis and
bone density (2, 3), in part by affecting vitamin D metabolism
and binding (4). Ascorbic acid has also been reported to affect
markers of osteoblast activity (23). Ascorbic acid deficiency
has also been associated with osteoporosis in Black South
African men in several older studies (5­7). More recent stud-
ies have examined dietary and supplement intake of ascorbic
acid as a correlate of bone mineral density (9­11, 24­27) or
hip fracture (12). With the exception of the Honolulu Heart
Study that included 1,208 men of Japanese ancestry (24), these
studies have included only women (9­12, 25­27) and none
have examined the relation of blood ascorbic acid levels to
bone mineral density or fracture. The prior studies have mea-
sured bone mineral density at different sites and reported,
albeit inconsistently, a positive association between dietary
ascorbic acid consumption or supplement use and bone min-
eral density. We tested for nonlinear associations and found
several significant or marginally significant curvilinear associ-
ations, particularly among men. Although osteoporosis affects
approximately one of eight men (28), most of the studies
examining the relation of ascorbic acid to bone mineral den-
sity have focused on women and, hence, we are unable to
compare our findings among men with those of other pub-
lished studies.
Some investigators found ascorbic acid associated with
bone mineral density or hip fracture only among subgroups
of women (10­12). Although we were unable to detect an
interaction between ascorbic acid and calcium intake, we
did find that smoking and use of postmenopausal estrogens
modified the association of ascorbic acid with bone mineral
density or self-reported fracture. We found that increasing
serum ascorbic acid levels were associated with a decreased
prevalence of self-reported fractures among postmenopausal
women with a history of estrogen use (and smoking),
whereas the Fracture Intervention Trial reported an associa-
tion between ascorbic acid supplement use and bone mineral
density, but only among postmenopausal women without a
history of estrogen use (10). Although the explanation for
the differences between studies is unclear and may be the
result of chance, the interactions themselves were not
entirely unexpected. Estrogen-containing medication
increases the turnover of ascorbic acid (29) and is associated
with lowered ascorbic acid levels in the leukocytes,
platelets, and plasma of guinea pigs, primates, and humans
(30­34). Many studies have also demonstrated that smoking
decreases the absorption and increases the turnover of ascor-
bic acid, thereby lowering blood ascorbic acid levels (15).
Our study has several strengths and limitations worthy of
mention. Because NHANES III surveyed a large probability
sample of Americans, our findings should be generalizable to
the US population. We believe the slight demographic differ-
ences between the 86 percent of adult participants included
and the 14 percent of participants excluded are unlikely to
substantially affect the generalizability of our findings.
Further, the measurement of serum ascorbic acid levels on a
Ascorbic Acid and Bone Mineral Density 433
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 5, 2001
large sample of the population allows a more reliable assess-
ment of ascorbic acid status as a correlate of bone mineral
density compared with studies using dietary intake estima-
tions only. We found a three-way interaction among ascorbic
acid, smoking, and postmenopausal estrogen use. Because
three-way interactions are often difficult to replicate and may
be the result of chance, these results should be interpreted
cautiously. We detected several nonlinear associations and
one inverse association between serum ascorbic acid and
bone mineral density among postmenopausal women without
a history of smoking or estrogen use that were unexpected,
and it is possible that some of these associations may also be
chance findings. Measurement error as reflected in the rela-
tively low correlations between dietary ascorbic acid intake
and serum ascorbic acid level and between bone mineral den-
sity and fracture prevalence may also be a factor in the incon-
sistency of our findings. Most importantly, because of the
cross-sectional nature of the study, inferences regarding
causality should be made cautiously.
Among a probability sample of the US population, dietary
ascorbic acid intake and serum ascorbic acid levels were asso-
ciated, at least in some subgroups, with bone mineral density
and self-reported fracture. These associations were inconsis-
tent and similar to prior reports, and some were nonlinear.
Ongoing clinical trials of antioxidants for the prevention of
cardiovascular and eye disease provide other potential venues
for examining these relations, unbiased by differential recall
or unknown confounding.
