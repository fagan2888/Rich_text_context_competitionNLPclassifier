Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of hepatitis antibodies and liver en-
zymes with impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes in adults.
Methods: We analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 to 2004, a nation-
ally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized US population. Among adults (aged >20 years of
age) who were not problem drinkers, we examined hepatitis B and C antibodies and the liver enzymes
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glutamyl transaminase (GGT)
with impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes (unweighted, n  5234; weighted, n 
172,626,805). Logistic regression models were computed controlling for major risk factors that drive
diabetes screening, including age, gender, race, diagnosed hypertension, diagnosed hypercholesterol-
emia, and obesity.
Results: In unadjusted analyses 51% of individuals with undiagnosed diabetes have elevated GGT
versus 20% of individuals without diabetes or impaired fasting glucose (P  .01). Similarly, 43% of
individuals with undiagnosed diabetes have elevated ALT versus 23% of individuals without diabetes or
impaired fasting glucose (P  .01). AST and Hepatitis C antibodies were not associated with undiag-
nosed diabetes. In adjusted analyses, elevated GGT (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.44­3.20) and ALT
(odds ratio, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.06­3.20) are associated with undiagnosed diabetes. Similarly, in adjusted
analyses, elevated GGT (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00­1.53) and ALT (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.15­
1.79) are associated with impaired fasting glucose. Hepatitis antibodies, reporting a current liver prob-
lem, or AST were associated with having undiagnosed diabetes in adjusted analyses.
Conclusions: Liver function is associated with undiagnosed diabetes and impaired fasting glucose
and may justify further investigation as a risk stratification variable for undiagnosed diabetes or im-
paired fasting glucose. (J Am Board Fam Med 2008;21:497­503.)
Insulin resistance can be thought of as being com-
posed of hepatic and extrahepatic components that
play a role in impaired fasting glucose.1 Conse-
quently, hepatic problems affect insulin resistance.
Hepatitis is associated with insulin resistance.2
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is associated with insulin
resistance, and clearance of HCV improves insulin
resistance.3 This evidence would suggest that hep-
atitis and impaired liver function may be associated
with the development of diabetes.
Some limited data on the relationship between
liver enzymes and diabetes has suggested that
elevated liver enzymes, aspartate aminotransfer-
ase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and
glutamyl transaminase (GGT) are associated with
the development of diabetes.4­8 Other data has sug-
gested that the relationship between liver enzymes
and diabetes may be modified by the presence of
inflammation, with C-reactive protein (CRP) playing
a predictive role with liver enzymes and diabetes.9
Because of the asymptomatic nature of type 2
diabetes, between one third and a half of individuals

with diabetes are undiagnosed.10 The prevalence of
undiagnosed diabetes for adults in the United
States has been estimated at 2.4%, representing 4.9
million adults and nearly 30% of all diabetes in the
United States in 1999 to 2000.11 A significant pro-
portion of people (25%) with undiagnosed diabetes
have signs of nephropathy, suggesting that undiag-
nosed diabetes is not a benign condition.12 Conse-
quently, different risk factors for undiagnosed dia-
betes have been identified as ways to guide
screening strategies.13­16 The American Diabetes
Association recommends screening men and
women 45 years of age for undiagnosed type 2
diabetes.17 The US Preventive Services Task Force
recommends screening for diabetes among adults if
they have the risk factor of hypertension.18 Diabe-
tes UK recommends screening of white people
40 years of age and people from black, Asian, and
minority ethnic groups 25 years of age with one
or more major risk factors.19
There is little evidence as to whether the pres-
ence of hepatitis antibodies and elevated liver en-
zymes is associated with either current impaired
fasting glucose or undiagnosed diabetes. Thus, the
purpose of this study was to examine the relation-
ship of hepatitis antibodies and liver enzymes with
impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes.
We hypothesized that elevated liver enzymes will
be associated with the presence of impaired fasting
glucose and undiagnosed diabetes.
Methods
The data for this study were derived from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004, a nationally repre-
sentative sample of the noninstitutionalized US
population. The NHANES design includes an
oversampling of minorities and an ability to make
population estimates. More information on the
methodology of the NHANES 1999 to 2004, in-
cluding laboratory assessment, can be found at the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
website.20 This study included fasting participants
20 years old who were not problem drinkers of
alcohol. Problem drinking was defined as 14
drinks per week for men or 7 drinks per week for
women. We excluded binge drinkers, defined as 5
drinks during 1 day per week.21
Variables
Diabetes and Impaired Fasting Glucose
Diagnosed diabetes was defined as self-report of a
doctor's diagnosis of diabetes. Undiagnosed diabe-
tes was defined as patients reporting that they had
not been diagnosed by a doctor with diabetes but
who had fasting plasma glucose of 126 mg/dL.
Impaired fasting glucose was defined as patients not
diagnosed with diabetes who had fasting plasma
glucose of 100 to 125 mg/dL. Those not diagnosed
with diabetes who had fasting plasma glucose 100
mg/dL were classified as normal.16
Hepatitis Antibodies and Liver Function
Hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis C antibody
(confirmed) were classified as positive or negative.
The Ortho HBc Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) Test System is a qualitative ELISA
for the detection of total antibody to anti-HBc in
human serum or plasma. The Chiron RIBA 3.0
Strip Immunoblot Assay (SIA; Chiron Corpora-
tion, Inc., Emeryville, CA) is an in vitro qualitative
enzyme immunoassay for the detection of antibody
to hepatitis C virus in human serum or plasma. The
SIA was used to confirm hepatitis C identified us-
ing an anti-hepatitis C virus screening ELISA.
CRP was classified as low (0.3 mg/dL) or elevated
(0.3 mg/dL).22 After previous research relating
liver enzymes to the development of diabetes, liver
enzymes were classified as low (below the fourth
quartile) or high (fourth quartile). ALT 27.78
u/L was classified as elevated; AST 25.51 u/L was
classified as elevated; and GGT 29.48 u/L was
classified as elevated.4­6 We also evaluated patients
based on their answers to the questions, Has a
doctor or health professional ever told you that you
have a liver condition? and Do you still have a liver
condition?
Control Variables
In addition to age and gender, the control variable
of self-reported race/ethnicity was created out of a
question about the person's race and an additional
question about Hispanic ethnicity. Race/ethnicity
was classified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, and other. Body mass index was
calculated as kg/m2 from height and weight mea-
sured during the NHANES physical examination
and was analyzed as a continuous variable. Because
hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are risk
factors that drive screening for diabetes we felt that
498 JABFM November­December 2008 Vol. 21 No. 6 http://www.jabfm.org
it was important to control for previously diag-
nosed hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.
Previous diagnosis would allow health care provid-
ers to be aware of the condition. High cholesterol
was defined as the self-report of a doctor having
told the participant he or she had high cholesterol.
Those who had not been tested were considered to
have not been diagnosed with high cholesterol.
Hypertension was defined as the self-report of a
doctor ever having told the participant he or she
had high blood pressure or hypertension.
Analysis
Because this survey is based on a complex sampling
design that makes it representative of the noninsti-
tutionalized US population, we are able to make
nationally representative estimates. We used
SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for the
weighting and complex sampling design.
We evaluated bivariate relationships between
hepatitis antibodies, CRP, and liver enzymes with
diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, impaired
fasting glucose, and normal participants using 2
analysis. Because biomarkers may be affected by
treatment regimens once an individual has been
diagnosed with diabetes, we conducted additional
analyses focusing on individuals with undiagnosed
disease. We conducted adjusted logistic regres-
sions, excluding patients with diagnosed diabetes
and predicting undiagnosed impaired fasting glu-
cose and undiagnosed diabetes alone. Control vari-
ables included age, gender, race/ethnicity, body
mass index, previous diagnosis of hypercholesterol-
emia, and previous diagnosis of hypertension.
Finally, we examined whether the association
between liver enzymes and impaired fasting glucose
or undiagnosed diabetes was affected by elevated
CRP. We created variables with 4 categories: 1)
elevated liver enzyme, elevated CRP; 2) low liver
enzyme, elevated CRP; 3) elevated liver enzyme,
low CRP; and 4) low liver enzyme, low CRP. The
combination of GGT, AST, and ATL with CRP
were used in 3 separate logistic regressions to pre-
dict undiagnosed diabetes or impaired fasting glu-
cose, adjusted for the previously identified control
variables. In the analyses of this study we assumed
a level of P  .05 to represent statistical signifi-
cance.

Results
The characteristics of the population are presented
in Table 1. A substantial proportion of the sample
had elevated liver enzymes and a much smaller
proportion, as might be expected, had positive an-
tibodies for hepatitis B or C. Table 2 shows that,
when liver enzymes are crossed with diabetes sta-
tus, an increased proportion of individuals with
undiagnosed diabetes have elevated GGT and
ALT.
In adjusted logistic regressions, hepatitis anti-
bodies are not significantly associated with either
undiagnosed diabetes or the more broadly defined
category including undiagnosed diabetes and the

prediabetic state of impaired fasting glucose (Table
3). Elevated GGT and ALT, but not AST, are
associated with undiagnosed diabetes as well as im-
paired fasting glucose. People who report currently
having a doctor-diagnosed liver condition were not
associated with undiagnosed diabetes (odds ratio,
0.98; 95% CI, 0.10­9.70) or impaired fasting glu-
cose (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.43­2.40).
Table 4 presents the results of the adjusted lo-
gistic regressions that include liver enzymes com-
bined with CRP. As with the single variable anal-
yses, in the combined variable analysis there is no
relationship between undiagnosed diabetes and
AST. Neither ALT nor GGT seems to indicate an
interaction between liver enzymes and CRP and
the likelihood of having undiagnosed diabetes. The
results for impaired fasting glucose did seem to
suggest that having elevated GGT and elevated
CRP increased the likelihood of having impaired
fasting glucose.
Discussion
The results of this study add to our knowledge of
current markers that are associated with the pres-
ence of undetected diabetes. Hepatitis B was asso-
ciated with diabetes in unadjusted analyses, but
when other risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes
were accounted for this marker was no longer sig-
nificant. However, both elevated ALT and GGT
were independently associated with a significantly
greater likelihood of having undiagnosed diabetes
and impaired fasting glucose. Previous research has
suggested that elevated ALT and GGT are associ-
ated with the development of diabetes.4­8 This
suggests that not only is liver function associated
with the development of diabetes but it also seems
to be a risk factor for currently having undiagnosed
diabetes.
The finding that AST was not significantly asso-
ciated may be because, although ALT is found pri-
marily in the liver, AST is found not only in the liver
but also in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys,
brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes
(in decreasing order of concentration). Thus, it may
not be as specific a marker of the liver injury that is
associated with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose.
One implication of these findings for clinical
practice is that undiagnosed diabetes should be
considered as a possibility in instances of elevated
ALT or GGT. A finding of elevated liver enzymes
may act for clinicians as a cue to consider an inves-
tigation of the possibility of undiagnosed diabetes
or impaired fasting glucose, even in the absence of
other common risk factors. These results suggest

that not only is liver function a risk factor for the
development of diabetes--it is also a marker that
clinicians should consider for increased suspicion of
undetected diabetes.
Several limitations to this study should be noted.
First, although this study used a strategy for identify-
ing undiagnosed diabetes that has been previously
used in the NHANES for population-based esti-
mates, it is not consistent with the recommendations
for a clinical diagnosis of diabetes because of the
one-time assessment.11,12 Second, the NHANES
provides estimates for majority of individuals in the
United States but it is limited to noninstitutionalized
individuals in the United States, and thus the rela-
tionship between liver enzymes and undiagnosed di-
abetes may not hold for prisoners or other institu-
tionalized individuals. Several variables are based on
self-reports by the patients (eg, previous diagnosis by
a doctor of diabetes, high cholesterol, or hyperten-
sion). Although the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics has for many years uses a cognitive laboratory
to evaluate and validate items regarding receipt of
health services and health behaviors, there is a possi-
bility of response bias in these questions.23
The results presented here suggest that elevated
liver tests, especially of ALT and GGT, indicate
that clinicians might want to investigate whether or
not a patient has undiagnosed diabetes. Liver func-
tion as a risk stratification variable for undetected
diabetes or impaired fasting glucose may be worth
further investigation.
