ABSTRACT Mortality rates in the United States from coronary artery disease are higher among
blacks than whites at younger ages, with a crossover to lower rates above the age of70. The factors that
determine this crossover of age-specific death rates have not been elucidated. Selection from the black
population of younger individuals who are sicker by virtue ofbeing more coronary prone might leave a
relatively healthier group ofolder persons. Support for this hypothesis would consist in part ofevidence
that coronary artery disease has an earlier onset in the black population. We examined data from the
National Hospital Discharge Survey for the years 1973-1984 to determine if age-related differences in
case-fatality rates existed between whites and nonwhites. In-hospital case fatality rates were 10% to
70% higher for each of the 10 year age groups for nonwhites up to age 70, at which time a crossover
occurred. The median age at death from myocardial infarction was approximately 5 years younger in
nonwhites compared with whites. National estimates of hospitalization rates for myocardial infarction
from these data likewise suggest that nonwhites receive less health care for coronary artery disease than
whites relative to recorded fatal events. The age-specific trends in case-fatality support the hypothesis
that a cohort selection effect in part determines the black/white differentials in coronary artery disease.
Relative susceptibility of the black and white population is thus not appropriately estimated by age-
adjusted rates, but should be examined on an age-specific basis within the framework of selection
effects on a cohort.

THE EPIDEMIOLOGY of coronary artery disease
(CAD) in the black population of the United States has
been the subject of significant recent controversy. 1-3
From the cohort studies that have been reported to date
it is clear that the standard coronary risk factors influ-
ence the development of CAD among blacks to a rea-
sonably similar degree to that described for U.S.
whites and other populations.7 Major inconsistencies
have arisen, however, when efforts have been made to
compare quantitatively the disease burden from CAD
in whites and blacks. Given the twofold greater preva-
lence of hypertension among U.S. blacks, and similar
levels of hypercholesterolemia and cigarette smok-

ing,'3 it would be anticipated that blacks should suffer
higher rates of CAD. Comparison of vital statistics
data, however, suggest nearly equal age-adjusted
CAD mortality in black and white men, with only
modestly higher rates among black women compared
with their white counterparts." 9 Data from several
community studies have further shown that the in-
hospital death rates from CAD is lower among blacks
than whites, accompanied by an excess of out-of-hos-
pital deaths."'2 Death. certificate coding for out-of-
hospital and sudden CAD death is not highly reliable
and it has been suggested that the higher CAD rates
reported among blacks in the vital records are an arti-
fact, resulting primarily from misclassification of
these medically unattended events.'3' '4
Estimated differentials in CAD mortality between
the black and white populations have generally been
based on only age-adjusted rates. Age adjustment
tends to weight these comparisons toward deaths
among the elderly and does not account for the poten-
tial effects of selection and competing cause. These

considerations led to the formulation of the following
hypothesis as an explanation for the observed racial
differentials presently observed in the United States
with respect to this disease: CAD is in fact more severe
among blacks than whites, as would be anticipated
from the distribution of coronary risk factors. Among
blacks the disease would therefore be expected to have
its onset at a younger age (i.e., a higher proportion of
cases will occur "prematurely") and at any given age
the disease will be more severe relative to that in
whites. To test this hypothesis we examined racial
differences in age-specific case fatality rates from
myocardial infarction in a representative sample of
U.S. hospitals. In addition, the age trends in mortality
from CAD from the two populations were further stud-
ied tirough use of vital statistics data.
Methods
Data sources
Hospital discharge data. Hospital discharge data were pro-
vided by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
through the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS). De-
tailed descriptions of the methods used for the NHDS have been
published elsewhere.5' 16 The NHDS is an ongoing sample
survey drawn from a frame of 7500 short-stay hospitals in the
United States, exclusive of military and Veterans Administra-
tion facilities. Hospitals are stratified on the basis of size (num-
ber ofbeds) and geographic location, and within each hospital a
random sample of discharges are selected. Data are abstracted
either by local hospital staff or by representatives of the NCHS.
In 1984, from a total of approximately 6000 hospitals, 533 were
selected to participate, and data were ultimately collected from
407 of those institutions. Approximately 192,083 abstracts of
medical records were entered into the survey file that year.
All discharge diagnoses and procedures were listed on the
abstract in the order of the principal one, or the first-listed one if
the principal one was not identified, followed by the order in
which all diagnoses were entered on the discharge sheet. Coding
was then carried out by NCHS staff according to the Eighth
Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, Adapt-
ed (ICDA-8) for 1973-1978, and the Ninth Revision (ICD-9-
CM) for 1979-1983. Race, which is not formally required on
discharge summaries, was missing from 8.9% of records in
1984; persons with race not stated were excluded from the
present study in all years. Procedures for identifying nonwhites
varied from year to year but consisted primarily of aggregating
blacks and native Americans; Hispanics were coded "white".
The category of "nonwhite" is taken to represent "black" in this
analysis, as in all studies based on the national vital statistics
data before 1979. For the year 1978 data were available on
computer tapes on which race was coded as black and nonwhite;
88% of the individuals in the nonwhite category were identified
as black. It is assumed, therefore, that the vast majority of
individuals in the nonwhite category in each year are black and
this segment of the population weights the outcome.
Analysis was restricted to persons over the age of 35, given
the low incidence of myocardial infarction before this age. In-
hospital fatality rates were age-adjusted to a standard population
of all cases. In the entire sample, including all 12 years of data,
43,849 discharge forms contained the mention of myocardial
infarction (ICD Code 410) at any rank order (i.e., not restricted
to principal or first diagnosis), and of this number 3146(13.9%)
were coded as race "other." Because of those methodologic
problems the NCHS does not routinely report data from the
NHDS by race, and the present findings must be interpreted
with caution for this reason. The survey did not differentiate
acute myocardial infarction during the hospitalization being ex-
amined from any mention of a prior event; therefore the same
individual admitted more than once to a study hospital would be
counted as a case on each occasion if acute myocardial infarc-
tion appeared on the discharge summary. To obtain data on a
sufricient number of deaths in each age-sex-race cell, data from
the 12 year period 1973 to 1984 were pooled. Separate examina-
tion of the data in 4 year subgroups did not reveal any important
trends over time in the patterns of age or racial differentials. As
a result of the design of the NHDS, estimates of hospitalization
rates based on the civilian noninstitutionalized population could
be obtained, and these were calculated for each age-sex-race
group.
Mortality rates and vital statistics. Mortality data from acute
myocardial infarction for the resident U.S. population were
obtained from the NCHS. Death rates from myocardial infarc-
tion (ICD Code 410) in 1983 were examined by age-sex-race
subgroups, and the ratio of black to white deaths was calculated.
Population estimates for 1980 were obtained from the Bureau of
the Census and used to estimate discharge rates for myocardial
infarction in conjunction with the NHDS data for the years 1978
to 1982. Blacks were used as the population base to calculate
nonwhite rates.
Statistical analysis. In reporting data from the NHDS the
NCHS advises that estimates based on a sample size less than 60
be regarded with caution. The smallest number of discharges for
all 12 years combined was encountered in the age group 35 to 39
among blacks, in which 77 patients were discharged and five
died. Estimates of sampling error used in statistical testing do
not account for weighing or sample design, providing additional
reason to generalize beyond the sample with caution. Differ-
ences in case fatality rates were tested based on point estimates
for each 5 year age group with the chi-square test. Differences in
the relationship between case-fatality rates and age were exam-
ined by comparing the slopes of the rate between whites and
nonwhites after fitting the curve to a linear regression line plot
with the use of programs available with SAS. Although the
relationship between fatality rates and age is curvilinear, the
purpose of this analysis was not to estimate the shape of the
curve but to compare the slopes in the two groups; programs
were not available to compare two curvilinear relationships, so
straight line plots were estimated. Since the vital statistics repre-
sent data from entire population, not a sample, no statistical
tests were performed on those data.
Results
As presented in table 1A and figure 1, the in-hospi-
tal case fatality rates for whites and nonwhites were
calculated as a percentage by 5 year age groups from
35 to 39 and over. Rates were higher for nonwhites
than whites until the age of 70, at which time a cross-
over for the two oldest age categories was observed.
Fatality rates were significantly higher for nonwhites
compared with whites only among persons 35 to 39
years old (p = .03). At the same time, the age-adjust-
ed mortality was very slightly higher for whites for the
entire age spectrum because of the greater number of
deaths among the elderly in the white population and
the higher fatality rate in this oldest age group. The

ratios of mortality rates at various ages, nonwhite to
white, were as follows: 35 to 44, 1.7:1.0; 45 to 54,
1.3:1.0; 55 to 64, 1.1:1.0; 65 to 74, 1.0:1.0; and
75+, 0.8:1.0. The relationship between the case fa-
tality rate and age in the two groups was compared by
fitting the age-specific rates (table 1A) to a linear re-
gression plot. For whites the beta coefficient ( +SE)
was 0.701 + 0.083, while for nonwhites it was 0.567
± 0.065; the difference between these two slopes was
highly significant statistically (t = 24).
Among nonwhite men the in-hospital fatality rate
was higher than among whites for all but one of the 5
year age groups under 70, with a crossover observedat
that point (figure 1, B). Only sixteen nonwhite women
under40 were included in the sample, and in this group
three (19%) died in the hospital; except for higher rates
in this youngest age group, age-specific death rates
were similar in women of both races until age 70, at
which time nonwhite women experienced lower rates
(figure 1, B). A somewhat higher proportion of non-
white vs white patients were women - 43% vs 37%,
respectively. Overall in-hospital death rates were 16%
for white men, 15% for nonwhite men, 24% for white
women, and 20% for nonwhite women. Women ex-
perienced higher death rates than men in all age groups
below 70. The ratio of total discharges, men to wom-
en, was also highly age dependent; thus, at age 35 to 39
the mortality ratio for men to women was 6.1: 1.0 for
whites and 3.8:1.0 for nonwhites, while over age 70

the ratio was 0.8: 1.0 for both whites and nonwhites.
An estimate of the rate of additional complicating
conditions was sought by examining the frequency
with which other disorders were listed on the discharge
sheet in the four sex-race groups for the year 1984.
With a single exception, the following diagnostic
codes (ICD-9-CM) appeared among the first five listed
as second diagnoses for all groups: other forms of
chronic ischemic heart disease (414), cardiac arrhyth-
mias (427), heart failure (428), diabetes mellitus
(250), and essential hypertension (410) (table iB).
Further examination of third-listed diagnoses likewise
did not provide evidence of any differential pattern of
associated comorbid conditions by sex or race. The
rate at which other comorbid conditions were listed
was also identical in all four groups, ranging from 52%
to 55% cumulative frequency for the above-mentioned
five conditions. These data do not lend support to the
hypothesis that differential fatality rates can be attrib-
uted to the more frequent association of other medical
illnesses among blacks.
Given the steeper relationship between age and
case-fatality for whites and the more youthful age
structure of the black populations, proportional mor-
tality was distributed upward for whites compared with
nonwhites (table 2); the median age at death from
myocardial infarction in this sample fell between 70
and 74 for whites and between 65 and 69 for non-
whites.
Incidence rates based on hospital discharge rates
after myocardial infarction in the white and nonwhite
populations were estimated for the 5 years around
1980. For both sexes incidence rates were virtually
identical for the two racial groups at all ages, with a
slight excess among nonwhites during the age decade
of the 40s (figure 2, A). For men considered alone, a
slightly lower rate was observed between ages 45 and
70, although these rates were unstable because of the

small number of cases. Population-based in-hospital
death rates were estimated by combining the number of
discharges, the case-fatality rates and, the population
estimates by age, sex, and race (table 3). Hospital data
for the five years around 1980 were again used, togeth-
er with the 1980 census data. The actual rate of death
from myocardial infarction in the hospital, given high-
er case fatality and similar incidence, is twofold higher
for nonwhites under age 45, with the expected age
trend.
At least half of the deaths coded to myocardial in-
farction occur outside the hospital.'7 18 Trends in the
death rate in 1983 for the entire United States by age
and race are presented in figure 3, A. (Race as black is
available for these data.) Consistently higher rates
were noted until the crossover at age 70. The ratio of
age-specific death rates, nonwhite/white, were greater
than 3.0: 1.0 for the younger age groups for both sexes;
age-adjusted rates were similar, however, among men
and only 20% higher for women (white men = 196,
black men = 176, white women = 89, black women
= 107, per 100,000). Again, the variable racial differ-
entials by age are a result ofthe crossover phenomenon
observed among the elderly. The exponential increase
in the number of CAD deaths with age account for the
weighting of the age-adjusted rates by the 70 + age
group.
Discussion
Comparison of the relative disease burden for a
common illness in two populations is a complicated
undertaking. Selection of healthy survivors will play
an important role in determining rates of common ill-
ness among the elderly. 13 20 For the predominant cause
of death, such as CAD in the United States, large age-
related variations could be introduced by this phenom-

has been focused on the question ofthe relative rates of
CAD in the black and white populations.2' 24 The data
from the NHDS presented here, in combination with
the vital statistics, demonstrate that blacks suffer high-
er rates of CAD at younger ages. From these findings
we conclude that CAD has an earlier onset among
blacks and at any given age is more severe. The only
potential explanation for the decrease with age relative
to whites in both incidence and case-fatality would be
the effect of selection.'9'20 The paradox of lower age-

adjusted CAD rates among blacks is therefore a statis-
tical artifact yielded by the method of analysis. In
evaluating the relative disease burden, two distinctly
different approaches should be taken, based respec-
tively on the age-adjusted and age-specific data. While
the age-adjusted data provide an estimate of the overall
burden for the population relative to other causes and
the age-structure of the population, age-specific rates
more accurately reflect the force of the disease-causing
factors to which the population is exposed.
Studies of mortality crossover have been carried out
primarily by demographers. 19 20, 25 27
Manton and Stal-
lard in particular have explored the effect of "heteroge-
neity of frailty" on the age-related increase in mortal-
ity.25 While it could be assumed that the rate of
development of a disease process with age for an indi-
vidual could be imputed from the rates of increase for
the whole population, this assumption ignores the ef-
fect of selection.25 This concept implies that suscept-
ible individuals will be removed from the cohort at a
younger age, leaving a group of relatively more robust
survivors. A convergence of age-specific mortality
rates -
or in the special case an actual crossover is
therefore observed in the comparison of the black and
white populations of the United States 26-28 and this has

been shown not to be a result of inaccuracies in the
census data or age reporting.''9 ` The crossover/con-
vergence relationship observed in the trajectory of age-
specific mortality rates exists not only for all-cause
mortality, but for the major individual causes as
well.'9' 29
Stroke mortality, for example, which begins
at much higher rates among blacks, likewise converges
with that for whites among the elderly.30 This relation-
ship also applies in the comparison of the two sexes;
thus, among whites a 400% excess mortality for CAD
in the early 40s is reduced to 25% over age 85 in the
national rates,26 and male/female incidence crossed
over at age 65 in the Framingham study.31
How does heterogeneity of frailty explain the differ-
ential pattern of CAD mortality seen in blacks and
whites? The increased population risk of CAD, a result
primarily of excess hypertension, leads to premature
atherosclerosis among blacks. Evidence for the earlier
onset of CAD is derived from two sources, i.e., in-
creased death rates at younger ages, and a higher case-
fatality rate among those admitted to the hospital with
the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. While it is pos-
sible, as noted above, that increased mortality based on
vital records could be an artifact of miscoding of out-
of-hospital deaths, it is unlikely that this differential
applies to hospitalized cases. The only plausible expla-
nations of the increased case-fatality rates are more
severe CAD, the presence of other complicating medi-
cal conditions, and/or poorer quality health care. Our
estimate of complicating conditions suggested no race
difference in this sample; we were unable to evaluate
quality of care. Neither of these latter two explana-
tions, however, is consistent with a subsequent cross-
over to lower rates among blacks. Since the develop-
ment of CAD is an age-related process, the onset of the
disease at an earlier age in a given population implies
that the average patient will have more serious disease
at any given age. Invoking the explanation of more
severe disease to explain higher case-fatality among
younger blacks is likewise consistent with the vital
statistics data suggesting more deaths in the popula-
tion. Selection against the more coronary-prone indi-
viduals as a result of exposure to a greater force of
mortality from atherosclerosis would leave a healthier
cohort. At the same time, coronary-prone individuals
would be more likely to die from other cardiovascular

causes, such as stroke, heart failure, and renal disease,
and cancer associated with cigarette use31' 32; this latter
phenomenon is probably more important quantitative-
ly. The effect of this high competing mortality from
diseases related to hypertension and smoking would
further accentuate the selection of a cohort over 65 less
susceptible to CAD.
Both all-cause mortality rates and CAD rates are
lower in elderly blacks compared with whites. With
the most straightforward approach of dividing the pop-
ulation at age 65, it is possible to account for only a
fraction of the deficit in CAD deaths among elderly
blacks by transfer of excess CAD deaths from persons
under 65.26 About half of the difference, however, can
be accounted for by excess deaths from the broader
category ofcardiovascular diseases, and on the basis of
competing cause it is reasonable to assume that prema-
ture stroke and heart failure have eliminated some of
the coronary-prone individuals. An additional 5% to
30% of the deaths, however, must be assumed to have
resulted from other, noncardiovascular, causes. While
it is likely that lung cancer, which is twice as common
in black as white men under age 65, may eliminate
potential CAD victims, it is difficult to identify other
specific death categories that are of sufficient size to
compete with CAD. Furthermore, all such arguments
must remain theoretical since an individual can die
only once and all assumptions about competing cause
must remain unproven empirically.
In-hospital case fatality rates from myocardial in-
farction are generally reported to be in the range of
10% to 20% and have changed little over the last two
decades.31' The lower limit ofrates based on recent
data were reported by the community surveillance pro-
gram in Minneapolis, where 9% of men and 11% of
women admitted with a documented myocardial in-
farction died before discharge.` Rates in the range of
20% are more commonly reported, however. The 30
day fatality from myocardial infarction in the Fram-
ingham study was 16% for men and 28% for women.31
Based on 17,000 admissions to 65 hospitals in the
Boston area, case-fatality rates were 22% in 1973-
1974 and 23% in 1978-197934 Three previous reports
including black patients demonstrated rates between
20% and 25%, and these did not differ from those for
whites in the same geographic area or institu-
tion. 12' 3 37 Comparisons by age group were not carried
out, and the samples were too small individually to
permit such an analysis, so it is not possible to deter-
mine if the age-related racial differentials in case-fa-
tality described here were present in these other stud-
ies. There are data suggesting that long-term survival
after myocardial infarction is shorter in blacks,38 39
although this question requires further study.
As an attempt to gain insight into population-based
event rates the present data set is not without signifi-
cant limitations. As noted in the Methods section, a
sizable hospital nonresponse rate exists for each year,
and data on race are missing for 5% to 10% of rec-
ords.`6 Separate analysis of discharge summaries in
which race was not stated suggest that they follow the
pattern of all summaries combined, i.e., they are
drawn proportionally from white and nonwhite cate-
gories, but this cannot be proven. Further bias may
have been introduced by exclusion of all nonhospital
cases. There is evidence that out-of-hospital death
rates are higher for blacks than whites` 10-12 and delay
before arrival at the hospital is markedly prolonged.36
Whether this phenomenon results in a mix of hospital-
ized cases with greater or lesser risk ofdying cannot be
determined with the data presently available, however.
Local studies with direct population surveillance will
be required to answer these questions.
Incidence rates for myocardial infarction in blacks
compared with those in whites have been difficult to
determine and are the subject of some controversy.
Seven population studies reviewed by Gillum2 report-
ed comparative data by race collected before 1978.
Blacks were noted to have lower age-adjusted rates in
all of these studies; the sample size of each study was
not large, however, and those from the rural South
may not be representative. The 5 year follow-up data
of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial screen-
ees demonstrate lower than expected CAD rates
among blacks, with a lower risk associated with hyper-
tension.5 Although based on a very large sample, the
representative character ofthese findings remains open
to question. More recent data from the pilot phase of
the Community Cardiovascular Surveillance Program
(CCSP) demonstrate higher age-adjusted death rates
from myocardial infarction (ICD Code 410) for blacks
of both sexes, and this differential is even more pro-
nounced in the younger age groups,40 while age-adjust-
ed rates of nonfatal events are higher in whites than
blacks. Interestingly, however, incidence rates are
consistently higher for blacks in the age groups under
45, thus confirming the crossover pattern seen in our
data. Since all these estimates of incidence rely on
hospitalization rates they must be viewed as an inexact
reflection of the true population rate. The findings
from the large data base reported here suggest that over
the last decade there have been comparable rates of
admission for myocardial infarction in blacks and
whites. The death rate from CAD has declined in both

blacks and whites since the late 1960s, so it is unlikely
that lower incidence rates from the earlier studies re-
flect secular trends.4` At the present time overall health
care utilization is similar for the two races, although
there may be some residual inequality if one corrects
for increased need, i.e., disease prevalence, among
blacks.42' 43 At any rate, the present study and the pilot
phase of CCSP represent the largest and most recent
studies, and both give evidence of higher rates of fatal
CAD among younger blacks.
The population-based incidence rates derived in this
analysis are not directly comparable to those from oth-
er studies since they are based only on hospital admis-
sions and do not separate first from recurrent cases.
Based on hospital admissions, Goldman et al.' report
rates of myocardial infarction that increased from ap-
proximately 200 per 100,000 among individuals 40 to
49 years old to 1300 in those over 70, with an overall
rate of 650.34 The in-hospital population death rate was
12 to 14 per 100,000 in patients from 40 to 49 and 475
in the 70 + group.34 Despite differences in methods,
the rates reported here are in a very similar range.
In summary, based on the different age patterns of
admission to the hospital for myocardial infarction and
the case-fatality rates, we conclude that CAD onset is
at an earlier average age in blacks than whites. The
most likely explanation of findings presented here
would thus be the presence of more severe atheroscle-
rosis in the age groups under 70 years. Lower rates in
the elderly could be explained by selection. Consider-
ation of the relative rates of CAD in the black and
white populations as they relate to cause or force of
mortality should thus rely on age-specific disease
rates, not those that are age-adjusted. Further data
from well-designed surveys that apply standardized
diagnostic criteria will be needed to confirm the find-
ings of the present study and further clarify questions
related to out-of-hospital mortality.
We express our appreciation to Robert Pokras of the National
Center for Health Statistics for performing the data analysis, and
to Ms. Debra Leonard for assistance in preparation ofthe manu-
script.
