  Objective: To estimate and compare the HTV ris ks among thre e His pan ic s ubp o pu­ lation s .
Methods: Chronic drug use rs partici pat in g in a nationwide i nterv e ntion s tud y on
drug use were in ter viewe d wit h reg ard to drug use and  sex ual behavior.  HIV  ris k  was est i mated us i ng in format io n about ind ivid uals' HIV-re le vant behavior , th e soc ial context (i. e. , city) in which such be hav io rs occur, and  pub li s he d  es ti mate  o f  HIV trans m iss ion for various ri  k behavior  . Multi ple  lin ear reg ress ion  analys is was use d to i n ves tig ate d iffe re nce s in estimated HIV ris k between Pue rto  R ic an,  Me x ic a n­ Amer ic an, and Mex ic a n drug u er , accounting for socio de mog rap h ic fac tor , sex ua l prefe re nce , and geographic reg io n.
  Results: Puerto Ricans had s ig n ific ant ly g reater es tim ated  ove rall  HIV  ris k,  est i­ mat ed i nje c tio n ris k, and in ge ne ral , s ig n ifica ntly grea te r es timat ed sex ual ri k than Mexican  Americans   and  Mex ic ans.   No  sig nifi cant  d i ffe ren ces   were   found   in  any e tim ated  risk  between  Me x ican Americans and Mex icans in  thi  sa mp l e. o  s i g n ifi­ cant  d iffer ence s  were  found  among  any  of  the  sub groups  for  es ti mated  ri  k  from hav ing anal sex wh i le us i ng a co ndom , o r from having  receptive ana l sex without us in g a cond o m.
Conclusions: These find in gs s uggest that Puerto R ic ans who use drug expe rie nce

  This paper repo rts the res ult s of a study c omp a ri ng the estimated HIV ris k of  injection  d rug  and/or  crack  co­ caine users of Mexican, Mexic a n-Am er ic an, and Puerto Rican ethnic identification. For se ve ra l ye a.rs, soc ial sc i­ entists have called for resea rc h focusing on  cultural  and other differe nce s between variou  His pan ic  u bgrou ps (1,2). However, mo st stud ie s of  HIV  risk  still  consider His panics as a homo ge neo us et hn ic grou p. Even rarer than studies that  reco gn ize d iffe re nce s among His p an ic s ub group s are st udie s of high-r is k popu lat io ns, such a injection drug or crack cocaine users , that rec og n ize s uc h

differences. In their 1994 contribution to  a  volume  on His pan ic dru g use , Friedman, Sufia n, and Des Jarlais lament that only a few studie s re port how Latino inje c­ tion dru g users (IDUs) differ  in AIDS-related  behav ior, re lations h ips, or knowledge from African-American and no n- His panic non-African-American IDUs, and we know of no studies that have syste mat ic al ly i nve stigated differences among sub sets of Latino dr ug users (2) .
  Despite the absence  of  analyses  spec ifically  des igned to comp a re s u bgroups of Hispan ic drug use rs , a body of literature on His panic s ub group and HIV has beco me available over the past 5 years. This  li te ratur e  s uggests that Puerto Rican drug use rs are lik e ly to be at su bsta n­ tially higher risk for contracting HIV than Mexican or Mexican-American dru g use r , and that th is is likely to

DISEASE STATUS AND RISK BERAVIOR

  Puerto R ic a n p opulatio ns experience highe r rates of num ero us adverse he alth co nd itio ns than o the r Hispanic population s (3- 5). Data  on  HIV  and  AIDS  prevalence amo ng Hisp anics are co ns iste nt with this  pattern.  HIV sero prevale nce (6,7), AIDS prevalence (8), and AIDS mortality (9) have been fo und to be sub stantia ll y higher amo ng Pue rto Ricans than amo ng other Hispa nics, and low e r amo ng Hispan ics of Mex ic an ances try.
  To ide nti fy behavioral factor s that ma y ha ve co ntrib­ uted to thi  HIV-disease  pattern  a mong  Hispa nic  ,  re­ searc hers have often use d the U.S. Centers for Di ease Control and Preve nt ion (CDC) ' s transm iss io n route clas­ sification     y  tern.  Among  the  CDC's  class ificatio n  ,  il­ le gal drug in jection  has  been  ide nt ified  a  the trans m is­ s io n route mo s t co mmon amo ng Pue rto Rican s with AIDS, whereas male- male sex is ident ified as the co m­ monest route among othe r sub group s of Hi panics with AIDS (10). A survey of Latin os with AIDS by Dia z and Kleve ns (1 1)  an d  the  sero prevalence  s ur vey  cited  (7) le nd further sup port to the notio n that Pue rto Rica ns are mor e likely than other His panic s to be IDUs. Conversely, Pue rto Rican respo nd e nts to the National Hea l t h Inter­ view Survey- AIDS Supplement  were  no  more lik  e ly than Mexican-American respond e nts to  report  injection drug use o r other h igh- risk behaviors (12).

Behavioral  Ris k

  The cited stud ies c omp are disease rates  and  risk  be­ hav iors  for  different  Hispani c  po pul ations.  Howeve r, ne ith er disea se rate nor risk  behavior  rates  offer  ad­ equate i nfo rmation o n behaviora l risk, the degree of risk attac he d to specif i c kinds  of  behav iors  for  s pecific grou ps. To meas ur e behav io ral risk, researchers  use  i n­ fo rmatio n on disease state, behavi or, and other relevant phenome na to an·ive at an es timation of ri k. This esti­ mation represents the  probability  that  a  member  of  group X will acq uir e the di ease from  behavior  Y,  given  a specific set of assumptions.
  Previous studi es have est i mated the relative  risk  of AIDS fo r me mbers of the Hispanic  population  in  the United States compared wit h the no n-Hi sp anic  wh ite popul atio n ( J 3) and the relative risk of AIDS for  mem­ bers of variou Hispanic  subpopulation  s  in  the  United States by birthplace given certain disposing behavior cat-



egories (14). The ava ilabili ty of pu bli s hed est i mates  of the probability of HIV transm iss ion for va rio us r isk be­ haviors  now  makes  it  poss ible  to  esti mate  the  ri  k  to wh ic h differently situated i nd ivid uals are exposed as a result of the ir behav iors. To  o ur  knowledge,  Smith  and co lleag ues' presentation at the 1 993 International Con­ ference on AIDS represents the on ly  attempt  to  arrive  at suc h an estimation (] 5). Their estim atio n method incor­ porated in fo rmatio n about indi vidu a ls' HIV-r elevant be­ haviors; specifical ly, it  incorporated  information  about types of sex ual contacts, rates of co nd om  use , and  num­ ber of partners (15). In this paper , we propo  e  to estim ate the risks of differently situated person with i n three His­ panic subpo pulations. Like Smith and co lleag ues' esti­ mation met ho d, the estimatio n method use d he re inco r­ porates info rma tion  about  behaviors.  Unlike  the  earlier re port ,  thee  timatio n  method  u  ed  here also  incorporates i nfo rmatio n abo ut the soc ial c ontext (specifica ll y, the city) in which suc h behaviors occ ur.

METHODS

  Data for this study were co llected from samp les of out-of-tr ea tm en t long-te nn drug users at 1 8 s ites in the  nit ed  States as part of the first wave of a longi tudinal mu lt is ite interve ntion s t udy  on drug use , HIV ris k behaviors, and risk-red uc tion  outcomes s uppo rted  by the National l nstit ute on Drug Abuse (the Cooperative Agreement for AIDS Com­ mun it y- Based Outre ach/Inter ve ntion Resear c h).  Targeted  snowball sa mpl i ng methods adapted to the ide ntifi cat ion and rec ru itm e nt of hid­ den popu lations we re  use d  to obta in  the  study  sam ple  ( J 6).  To  be e li gible for the study , i ndi viduals  were  required  to  have  injected  an il l icit s ubstan ce during the last 30 days or smoked crack coca ine at least once during the previous 48 hour s and not  to have  been  in drug  treat­ me nt dur in g th e 30 days prior to part icipation. ln add ition, study par­ ticipants were re qu ired to be 1 8 years of age or older, to res ide withi n the boundar ies of the targeted areas, a nd LO s ign an informed co n e nt. All c andidates were req uir ed to prov ide a urine sa mpl e, which was scree ned  fo r cocai ne  a nd opio id  metab oli te  . Cand idates  clai m in g drug inj ec tio n we re req ui red to show rece nt need le- t rack markin g. Th ose who claimed Lo have s mok ed crack cocaine mu st have had pos iti ve urine screens for coca in e to be included in rhe stud y. Sub jects who did not meet the e li gi bili ty c riteria were de le ted from the samp le.
  Partic i pants w ho could not pro vide a ver i fiable address and te le­ pho ne num ber for reco nt ac t in the fol low-up wave of the study were not i nclu ded. Int erviews were conducted in private settings by trained in ­ terv ie wers ,  usu a.11y  at  researc h  ce nters  loc ated  in  the  neigh borhoods from which study participants were rec ruited. Partici pants were re mu ­ nerated for their time ; this fee varied by site.

Measures

  The Ri k Behavior Assess me nt (RBA) was used to coll ec t informa­ tion about nee dle risk behaviors , sex ris k behav io rs, a nd demo gra ph ics ( 1 7). The re li abilit y and vali dity of the drug use and sex ua l behavior items on  this instrument  have been demo ns trated (J 8). Behavioral ques­
tions in the RBA so lici ted information on the number of times and the number of  people with whom  a re  pondent engaged  in  needle  use  and

sexual ri sk behav i ors durin g  the  30 days  before being interviewed. Th ese behavioral self -reports were used to compute estim ates of HIV transmissi on ri sk . A more complete desc ripti on of the measur es used in
thi s stud y is avail able from the corr esponding author.
 
Jn additi on to estim ating each respondent's overall ri sk, estimates were made of the ri sk from each risk behavior separat el y. That i s, calculations as in Eq u atio n I were perform ed for each ri sk behavior.

Overall ri sk and ri sk s from sp eci fic behavi ors were estimated usin g

number s of ri sk acts describ ed in the RBA. Thirty-day  frequencies of two injection ri sk behavi ors were estimated: inj ecting wit h a needle (or syringe or " works") that had been previously used by another person, and usi ng cooker, co tton, and /or rin se water that had been used by someone el se. Thirt y- day frequ encies of sex- ri sk behav iors were handl ed in a si mil ar way to injection ri sks . Eig ht sex- ri sk behaviors were estimated from RBA  responses. N u mber  of  insertive  and recep­ ti ve, vagin al and anal sex acts in the previous 30 days were reported. Report s were furth er subdi vid ed by how of ten a condom was used and not used. Each resp ondent was asked about the number of sex acts with mal e partners and female partn ers separately.
Frequencies of inj ection and sexual behaviors were used to com pute
an estim ate of the respondent' s overall risk of HIV in fecti on durin g the previous 30 days. O verall transmissi on ri sk was consid ered  to be a fun ction of the number of  occa  ions  of  each  ri  k  behavior  and  the indi vidual transmissi on ri sk for  each behavior (20).  For  the  IO mea­ sur ed ri sk behaviors (2 injection ri sk and 8 sex ri sk behav iors). overall transmissi on ri sk was esti mated as:

The per-act transmissi on probabilit y depends both on the transmission rate and on the prevalence of HI V in the relevan t population:
l ; = f) ;/ ;	121

where p, i s the prevalence of HIV in the population of partn ers fo r ri sk behav ior i and /; is the rate o f transmissi on of HI V for risk behav ior i. The relevant populati on was taken to be the cit y or metropolitan area. Populati on prevalence of HIV (p;) was estimated based on the metro­ polit an A I DS preval ence rate where the data were coll ected ( 10). A I DS pr evalence can  be used  as a rough estim ate of  HIV  prevalence.  An  e ti mate of the local HIV pr eval ence rate was computed by di viding the 1996  number  of  cumulati ve  A IDS  cases  by  the  1996 estimated  cit y
population for each metropo li tan area from which data were draw n.
  Per-act transmi ssi on ri sk probabiliti es /f) were imput ed based on the
best avail abl e esti mates of transmission ri sk probabiliti es. A t the tim e o f the analysi s, th best per-act  transmission ri sk  estimates  were as foll ows:

 inj ection,/' , = 0.0067 (2 1 )
 shar ed cooker, cotton, and  water, / 2  = 0.000067,  set  at  I %  of  the inj ecti on transmissi on rate; no publi shed esti mates of this valu e were found
 vagin al sex from male to femal e with out a condom, / 3 = 0.00 I
(22,23)
 vaginal sex fr om femal e to mal e with out a condom, / = 0.0005 (24,25)
 vagina l sex with a condom, / 5 = 0.000018 and / 6 = 0.000009
(26- 29)
 recepti ve anal  sex  with out a condom, /    =  0.02 ( 19)
 inserti ve anal sex wi thout a condom, / 8 = 0.00 87 (25)
 anal sex with a condom, / = 0.0008 for the receiv er and / 10
0.000 35 for the in serter (26- 3 1 )
 
Risk behav iors were assumed to be relati vely stabl e and to extend into the past. B ecause HI V has a long incubatio n peri od (32,33), 30-day ri sks were projected over a I 0-yea r peri od according to the formula (3):
                I 0-year ri sk = I -  ( I - ri sk) 120	[4]
  To establi sh the vali di ty of  esti mated ri sk , the cumul ative I 0-year ri sk estimate was related to HIV serostatus in the sample. Respond ents who had previou sl y been told they were HIV posi ti ve were excl ud ed from the anal ysi s, as were those who were not te red for HIV . A r-test comparin g I 00 cases testi ng posi ti ve for HIV to I 633 cases testi ng negati ve for HI V found si gni ficantly greater ri sk on the overall measure
for  the  HI V  positi ve cases  (r  =  3.64).  Those respondents who were
HIV   negati ve  had  an esti mated  10-year  ri sk  o f  9.9%,  whereas those respondents were HIV posi ti ve had an estim ated 10-year ri sk of 19.4%.

Independent Variables
  Cases from the Cooperati ve Agreement dataset who identi fi ed them­ sel ves as M exic an Am eri can, M exican, or Puerto Ri can and who were recruit ed from ites in the continental U nit ed States were selected for this study. Dumm y  variabl e  were  created  for  self -identi fi cation  as M exican and Puerto Ri can. M ex ican- Ameri can sel f-id enti f ication was used as the resid ual category. Gender was coded 0 = male and I = female. Thirt y-day income was selected to measure inc ome. Educa­ tional aua in ment was mea ured with a 3-point scale, in whi ch I rep­ resented having less than a hi gh school education, 2 represented havin g recei ved onl y a hi gh school education or a general educati onal dipl oma (G ED), and 3 represented havin g more than a high school educati on, for instance, trade school or coll ege.
  I njection drug use was created as a dummy vari ab le for respondents who reported hav ing ever inj ected drugs. Prev i ous experi ence of HIV testin g as a control vari able to account for possibl e effects of k nowl­ edge of personal  erostatus on ri sk behavi or. Respondents who reported a previous HIV blood test (not includin g the HIV  test  admini stered during parti cipation in this stud y) were coded as h avi ng had experience of HI V testin g. To control for possible effects of age on ri sk, the current study used sel f-reported age, a continuous vari ab le. Respondent s who reported sex in the previo us 30 days with  a pa rtner of the  ame gender or who identi fi ed them el ves as gay, lesbi an or bisex ual were coded as havi ng had a same-gender (" same-sex") partner.
  Geographic region has been found to predict  HIV  seroprevalence rates (34,35). M ontoya  and  A tki nson (36)  found that geographic  loca­ ti on, as proxim atel y measured by time zone, correctly classi fi ed cit ies accordi ng to high, moderate, and low HIV -seroprevalence rates. T here­ fore, tim e zone was in cluded in this study as a control for geographic effects. Westwardn ess ( ti me zone) of each si te was measured by  as­ si gning the si te an integer from I to 5, where  I  represented  Eastern time, 2 represented Central time, 3 represented M ountain time, 4 rep­ resented Pacifi c time, and 5 repr esemed Ala ska tim e.

DISCUSSION

  Attempt    to  ide nt ify   the  factors   that  determine  drug a nd sex ual ris k behaviors of d rug u ers  are  cruc ial to acco mp li s h pu bli c he alth objective .  A  la rge  body  of ev ide nce has sug gested that race and ethn ic it y are im­ portant determ i na nt s of ris k behav io r. How eve r, most researc h that examines the effect of race/e thnic ity on  risk be hav io r amon g His pan ics aggregates all Hispa n ic s u b­ gro u ps i nt o a si ng le  c atego ry.  Res u lt  of  this analysis s how that suc h an approac h mask s c ritic al d iffere nce betwee n Hi s pan ic ub group s and that d ifferenc es  within a give n race/ethnicity are signi ficant   facto rs  in determin­   i ng  esti mated  ris k  for   HIV.  In  particular ,  th is pa pe r s hows that the es timated HIV risk amo ng s ub gro up s of His pan ic drug use rs is s ign ifica nt ly  higher  for  Puerto R ic ans  than it  is  for  Mexic ans  or  Mexican  Amer ic ans i nd e pe nd e ntly of soc io demog raph ic facto rs, sex ual pref­ erenc e , and geog rap h ic time zone .
Because  of  the way the estim ated HIV  risk was com­
puted, the highe r est im ated HIV ris k for  Puerto  Rica ns, as compared with o the r H is panic s ub g roups, may be the res u lt of behavioral ris k d ifferen ces or  HIV prev ale nce d iffere nce s. T hu s, the hi gh est imated HIV ris k amo ng Puerto Ric ans, as compared  with  that  of  othe r His pan ic s u bgrou ps, may be the result of the ir re lati ve ly h ig her

EST IM ATED HIV  RISK AMONG HISPANICS	49


num bers of risk behavior acts and/o r the h ighe r HIV prevalence in the cities where they l i ve . By est i mati ng HIV risk using ris k be hav io rs a nd co mm unit y HIV prevalence  toget her ,  a  more  comp le te  est imate  of   the d is tr ibution of HIV risk among  His pani cs  ca n  be  ob­ tai ne d.
  T heoretic ally , a  relationship  exists  between  risk  be­ hav io rs and HIV prevaJence. Philipson and Posner (37) argue  that  if  the   HIV   preva lence   within   a  community in c reases, the likelihood of indi vidu als engagin g in risk behavior will decrea se. This occurs  beca use  as  the  prob­ ab ility of HIV in fecti on increases, the price  of  ris k  be­ hav i o r  (in  terms  of  i lln ess  and  suffering)  i ncre ases ; he nce, risk behavior wi ll  decrease.  Thus,  it  is  expected that i nd i vid uals  li vi ng in a reas  with a hi gh HIV  preva­ le nce wi ll be less willing to s hare syri nges or have un ­ protected ex. Future research shou ld examine the re la­ tionship between ris k behavior and HIV prevalence  rates amo ng the gene ral popu lation and es pec ially amo ng His­ panics.
In th is s tud y, i nco me was fo und to have a positive
effect on es timate d HIV risk. It is certai n ly possible that extra i nco me is used  to buy  more drugs  i nstead of  clea n s yr i nges. A pos iti ve coeffic ient on i nc ome could also mea n that c ities with a h igher HIV prevalence have, in gene ral, hi gher i nc omes than c ities with lower HIV prevalence. This may he lp  ex plain  the  hi gher HIV  risk est i mates amon g Pue rto Ricans. Although this analys is acco unt ed fo r geograp hi c loc atio n as meas ur ed by ti me zone , most of the Pue rto Ric ans l ived in the New York City me tro polita n a rea, whe re the cost of livin g is h igher than in o ther locatio ns. C urr e nt research supp orted by the Nat io na l Institute of Drug Ab use (NID A) on soc ial net­ wo rks mi ght he lp determine whe the r (a nd why) higher i nco me ind ividu als engage in ris k behaviors with ot he r h ighe r i ncome i nd i vid ual s, or whet her they engage in ris k behavior s with lo wer income i nd i vid uals. T h is wi ll he l p researcher s determine how much ris k behavior or what types of risk behav io rs are d rive n by eco nom ic factors and how much are driven by othe r soc ial factors. Because cle ar d iffe re nces a re prese nt in HIV est i mated risk a mong Hisp an ic s ub group s in specific behavioral doma i ns, the next lin e of researc h need s to addre ss those factors that account for those  differe nces .  Associations with different econo mic , sociol ogic , and psychological influences sho ul d be exp lo red before definite  conclu­ sions are drawn. For instance this stud y did not  permit us to i nvest igate the effects of accu ltu ration and religio s ity on risk behav io rs (38). Future stud ies buildin g on the existing eth no graph ic li te rature and inco rpora ti ng de­ tailed eli c itat io n resea rc h are ne eded to account more


thoroughly  for  the  link  observed  here  between   different et hn ic su bgroups and ex ual and need le-s hari ng ris ks.
  Moreover , the combin ed effects of soc ioeconom ic de­ privation and rac ia l segregation  hou ld be exp lo red.  So­ cia l isolation a nd racia l se gregation have long been as­ sociated with higher rates of drug  us e , early  ini tiation of sex ual ac tivity, and other health ris ks (39,40). Further research sho uld exp lo re the exact mechanism by whic h these factors contribute to  risky  behaviors  amo ng  His­ panic su bgroups.
  Some limitatio ns of the stud y amp le s ho u ld be enu­ merated. First, the samp le use d in th is s tudy was a tar­ geted samp le of ID Us and crack cocaine us er s who were not in treatment. The refo re, gene rali zation sho u ld not be exte nd ed to othe r types of drug use rs, to drug use rs in treatment , o r to nond rug use r . Moreover , give n that the targeted population is h idden , the resea rche r  has  no  way of know ing whether the samp le obtained re present s th i population  as  regards  age,  ge nde  r,  and  other   demo­ grap hi c c hara cte ri tics.
This stud y is the first to quantify d ifference in est i­
mated HIV ris k amo ng three su bgroup of Hisp an ic drug use rs. As suc h, it le aves us w ith intriguing questions regarding spec ific facto rs that may he l p exp lain the  be­ hav io ral  differe nces  reported  here .  Broad  ethni c  labels s uc h as Puerto R ic a n,  Mexican,  or Mexican  American are but a first step in telling us  abo ut  the  way  the specific cu ltur al processes of these sub groups interact with  indi­ vid ual c haracte rist i c to in fl uence behavior (41,42). Measurement of other soc ial factors in f utur e hea lth be­ havio r s tud i es , parti c u la rly when these tud ies targe t groups out s ide the dominant cultur e, will be helpful in developing and implementing app ropriate  intervention progra ms fo r eac h of these Hispanic su bgrou ps.
