Abstract
Most bank efficiency studies that use stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) employ each
bank's own implicit input price when estimating efficient frontiers. But the theoretical
foundation of most studies is a cost minimisation and/ or profit maximisation problem
assuming perfect input markets. At the very least, traditional input price proxies therefore
contain substantial measurement error. In this paper, we examine the magnitude and
direction of this error in cost and profit efficiency (CE and PE) measurement. We suggest
two input market definitions to approximate exogenous input prices alternatively and
estimate CE and PE of German banks between 1993 and 2003. Our main findings are
threefold. First, after accounting for systematic differences across banks, mean CE is
sensitive to alternative input prices. Second, distortions of mean PE due to traditional input
prices are small. Third, across CE models small cooperative banks located in large western
states are identified as top performers. Large banks and those located in eastern states rank
lowest.
Keywords: Germany, Banks, cost efficiency, profit efficiency, stochastic frontier
analysis, measurement error.

Non-technical Summary
The last decade witnessed continuous changes in regulation, technology and competition in
the global financial services industry. German banks are no exception. Rising cost-income
ratios and declining profitability reflect increased competitive pressure. To assess the
stability of the banking system, it is therefore crucial to benchmark the performance of
banks operating in Germany. This allows identification of role models and problem banks.
One major obstacle to any benchmark methodology is to what extent investigated subjects
are comparable. To this end, traditionally employed key performance indicators (KPI)
enjoy the advantage of straightforward calculation. But they fail to account for systematic
differences between, say, commercial, savings and cooperative banks.
We therefore suggest a complementary methodology to benchmark banks on the basis of
their cost and profit efficiency. These measures quantify how successful banks are in
minimising cost and maximising profits when converting inputs into outputs. We assume
that all banks in Germany have access to the same production technology. At the same
time, we acknowledge that systematic differences prevail in terms of size, asset risk,
location, regional market concentration and bank pillar membership. Therefore, we
explicitly account for these differences.
To estimate optimal profits and costs we furthermore suggest two alternatives to
approximate input prices. In contrast to most studies, we utilise regional markets to
calculate market prices that banks face when arriving at their production decisions.
Our results identify cost inefficiencies on the order of 8 to 14 percentage points of actually
incurred costs. Foregone profits amount to 35 percentage points of actually accrued
profits. These inefficiencies emanate primarily among large commercial banks and apex
institutions of cooperative and savings banks.
From a regional perspective, banks located in new states suffer from above-average cost
inefficiency, but enjoy higher profit efficiency. From a banking group perspective,
cooperative banks are among the top performers in terms of cost efficiency, while savings
banks enjoy higher mean profit efficiency. From a size perspective, small banks
outperform large banks. Utilisation of alternative input prices leads to approximately 5
percentage points lower cost efficiency compared to traditional input prices. Therefore,
alternative input price measurement matters.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Finanzdienstleister sind in den letzten Jahren massiven Veränderungen in den Bereichen
Regulierung, Technologie und Wettbewerb ausgesetzt gewesen. Das deutsche Bankwesen
stellt dabei keine Ausnahme dar. Steigende Aufwand-Ertrags-Relationen und sinkende
Profitabilität reflektieren gestiegenen Wettbewerbsdruck. Zur Beurteilung der Stabilität des
Bankensystems ist daher ein Vergleich von Banken zur Identifikation der effizientesten
und ineffizientesten Banken von entscheidender Bedeutung.
Bei jeder Benchmarking-Methode ist ausschlaggebend, dass die betrachteten Banken auch
tatsächlich vergleichbar sind. Traditionelle Vergleichsgrößen haben zwar den Vorteil, dass
sie leicht zu berechnen sind. Ein wichtiger Nachteil liegt jedoch darin, dass systematische
Unterschiede, z. B. zwischen den Banksektoren, nicht explizit berücksichtigt werden.
Wir schlagen deshalb eine ergänzende Benchmarking-Methode vor. Kosten- und
Profiteffizienz quantifizieren die Fähigkeit einer Bank, bei der Produktion Kosten zu
minimieren bzw. Profite zu maximieren. Wir nehmen an, dass alle deutsche Banken
Zugang zu der gleichen Produktionstechnologie haben. Gleichzeitig berücksichtigen wir
dabei existierende Unterschiede hinsichtlich Größe, Risiko, Einsatzort, Marktkonzentration
und Sektorzugehörigkeit.
Um optimale Profite und Kosten zu schätzen, benutzen wir alternative Faktorpreise. Im
Gegensatz zu den meisten Studien berechnen wir die Faktorpreise, denen eine Bank
ausgesetzt war, in Abhängigkeit des jeweiligen regionalen Faktormarktes.
Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die durchschnittliche Kostenineffizienz zwischen 8 und 14
Prozent der tatsächlich realisierten Kosten beträgt. Nicht realisierte Profite betragen etwa
35 Prozent der aktuellen Profite. Ineffizienzen entstehen vornehmlich bei großen
Geschäftsbanken sowie den Zentralbanken des Genossenschafts- und Sparkassensektors.
Banken in den neuen Bundesländern leiden unter höherer Kostenineffizienz, zeigen jedoch
höhere Profiteffizienz. Regional tätige Genossenschaftsbanken sind überdurchschnittlich
kosteneffizient, während lokale Sparkassen überdurchschnittlich profiteffizient sind.
Kleine Banken arbeiten effizienter als große Institute. Die Verwendung von alternativen
Faktorpreisen beeinflusst insbesondere die Kosteneffizienzmaße. Die so ermittelte
Kosteneffizienz liegt im Mittel um etwa 5 Prozent niedriger als die traditionell geschätzte
Kosteneffizienz. Der Gebrauch von alternativen Faktorpreisen ist somit von Relevanz.

Measurement Matters ­
Input Price Proxies and Bank Efficiency in Germany #
1 Introduction
Since its introduction by Aigner et al. (1977), Battese and Corra (1977) and Meeusen and
Broeck (1977) stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) has received increasing attention in the
literature as a methodology to measure a single firm's efficiency.1 Decisive virtues of SFA
are to account for both (i) random noise, e.g. due to well-known measurement problems,
and (ii) systematic differences between banks in the sample due to heterogeneity across
banks (Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000).2 These features allow a relative comparison of
markedly different banks, for example large commercial versus small cooperative or
savings banks.3 In contrast to accounting-based key performance indicators (KPI), SFA
rankings therefore account explicitly for both environmental factors and random error.4
Independent of whether heterogeneity is accounted for or not, the specification of a cost or
profit function under the assumption of perfect input markets is at the core of most of these
applications. The error term is composed of white noise and inefficiency. By means of
maximum-likelihood techniques, we estimate best-practice frontiers, relative to which all
firms in the sample are compared. For each firm, we decompose the error term. Firms
deviate to varying degrees from this frontier according to the estimated inefficiency.
But as noted by Mountain and Thomas (1999) the vast majority of SFA studies share a
potentially severe measurement error when calculating input prices. The assumption of
perfect input markets requires a bank to be a price taker. It purchases inputs given prices
that are determined exogenously in the respective market. But most studies approximate

1 As early as 1997, Berger and Humphrey surveyed 130 bank efficiency studies.
2 If systematic differences are not accounted for they are mistakenly identified as inefficiency (Mester, 1997).
3 Coelli et al. (1998) note that relative rankings imply that only efficiency measures relative to an identical
frontier can be compared. This in turn means that efficiency measures from different frontiers, e.g. across
alternative studies or sub-samples within studies, cannot readily be compared.

input prices by relating individual banks' factor payments to employed production factors.5
Consequently, these prices are bank-specific rather than market-determined.6 Such proxies
might therefore be poor measures of theoretical counterparts. Poor measurement of true
explanatory variables, namely input prices, could distort efficiency estimations
substantially (Greene 1993, chapter 9).
This paper addresses the described potential measurement error. We suggest two
alternatives to approximate input prices and compare efficiency estimates when using
traditional versus alternative input price proxies. The paper is organised as follows. In the
next section, we review German bank efficiency studies and the respective approaches to
accommodate the discussed measurement error. Section three introduces the theoretical
model underlying efficiency measurement, our approach to proxy input prices alternatively
and the empirical specification to estimate cost and alternative profit efficiency (CE and
PE) for a heterogeneous sample of banks. Section four elaborates on the data used in this
study. In section five, we present and discuss our results. We conclude in section six.
2 Input prices and German efficiency studies
To our knowledge, Mountain and Thomas (1999) is the only study that explicitly discusses
the potential measurement error due to the use of bank-specific input prices. They argue
that under perfect (input market) competition banks should face at a given point in time
identical prices.7 Then, traditional input price proxies lead to biased efficiency results.
To assess the importance of this measurement error, they compare CE from two cost
frontier specifications with and without input prices. Efficiency estimates between the full
and the parsimonious model differ by 7 percentage points. However, they reject the
hypothesis that input price coefficients are simultaneously equal to zero. Despite this result
they conclude that input prices should be dropped. They evaluate the benefit from
obtaining more precise estimates to outweigh the cost due to a higher degree of
inconsistency because of omitting mismeasured proxy variables.8
They acknowledge that the use of "true" input prices is highly desirable, but argue that the
loss in precision requires that poor proxies be dropped. A first suggestion of Mountain and
5 Dividing interest expenses by borrowed funds is an example found in virtually every study.
6 Additionally, they are derived from the dependent variable, which should be explained - namely total cost.
7 In sum, concentration and competition studies (Bikker and Haaf, 2002 and Hempell, 2004) conclude that a
theoretical model from the realm of perfect competition is a defendable assumption for German banking.
8 According to Aigner (1974), proxy variables should be included even if they contain measurement error.
- 3 -
Thomas (1999) to alleviate this measurement error and to enhance estimation is to either
adjust the frontier for regional differences or to restrict estimation of the benchmark to a
sample of banks sufficiently akin to each other.9
German bank studies follow this suggestion only implicitly. Among the few available
studies, three follow the approach to use regional information primarily due to data
availability constraints. Lang and Welzel (1996, 1998a, 1998b) employ a sample that is
restricted to cooperative banks from Bavaria only.10 The authors use data collected from a
non-commercial database. In sum, these three studies find improving CE during the early
1990s. Average cost inefficiency is around 7 percent. Also, their evidence suggests that
smaller cooperatives perform better than larger cooperatives and that mergers between low
efficiency targets and better performing ones increase overall efficiency. The authors
carefully note, however, that their results only apply to the sector of cooperative banks in
general and to those located in the state of Bavaria in particular. Apparently, regional and
ownership differences prohibit a generalisation of their results.
Altunbas et al. (2001) further investigate efficiency differences across banking sectors and
size classes between 1989 and 1998.11 To our knowledge, this is the only parametric study
that simultaneously examines cost and profit efficiency of German banks. The study
supplies estimates of CE and PE against one identical frontier and against sector-specific
benchmarks. They find that inefficiencies are highest for commercial institutes and large
banks. For the full sample, CE amounts to 83 percent for the banking sector as a whole.
The ability of banks to realise potential profits is worse, as average PE amounts to 80
percent. Efficiency improves if measured against a benchmark for a more homogenous
sample, i.e. banks of one type only. This indicates that systematic differences that prevail
between commercial, savings and cooperative banks are wrongly dubbed inefficiency if
compared against a uniform frontier that is not adjusted for these factors.
These results are consistent with studies explicitly examining the importance to account for
heterogeneity when estimating bank-specific efficiency (Bos et al., 2004).12 But the
9 Note, however, that especially the approach to estimate, say, sector-specific frontiers suffers from the
drawback that efficiency measures can then no longer be compared across samples (Coelli et al., 1998).
10 Hence, systematic differences due to bank size, business mix and regional economic conditions are low.
11 The sectors are the three "pillars" in German banking: commercial, savings and co-operative banks.
12 Factors identified to cause heterogeneity are e.g. different regional macroeconomic conditions (Mester,
1997), varying risk profiles (Hughes and Mester, 1993) and bank market characteristics such as concentration
(Lozano-Vivas et al., 2002). Apparently, banks can be "grouped" according to many different criteria. But
true groups, i.e. markets, remain unknown and therefore these choices are ultimately arbitrary.
- 4 -
potential measurement error pointed out by Mountain and Thomas (1999) is in our view
not sufficiently accounted for by adjusting efficient frontiers and/or deviations from it.
To address the potential mismeasurement of input prices more directly, Mountain and
Thomas (1999) suggest as a second approach to measure input prices per factor market.
We argue that this "second" approach is an additional rather than an equivalent alternative
to measure efficiency appropriately. The only study we are aware of that pursues this
approach is Berger and Mester (2003). Using data on US banks of three cross-sections in
1984, 1991 and 1997, they derive prices per geographical market. For each bank they
calculate input prices faced as an average by all other banks in that particular market,
weighted by each bank's respective market share. Thus, they use for each bank an
exogenous price determined by competitors in the respective market. However, the study
fails to simultaneously account for additional sources of systematic differences across
banks. In addition, the authors do not provide a comparison with traditionally specified
input prices. Therefore, we do not know how severe this potential measurement error is.
This paper fills the gap. We estimate efficiency adjusted for heterogeneity and employ
alternative proxies of input prices as suggested by Mountain and Thomas (1999).
3 Methodology
To quantify the magnitude of efficiency distortions we provide a comparison. First, we
introduce a theoretical model and define our variables. Second, we turn to input price
proxies according to a benchmark model and two alternative approaches. Third, we
introduce the empirical specification that also accounts for heterogeneity.
3.1 Model specification
We follow the intermediation approach to model bank production and define three
according outputs.13 The first output captures interbank loans, y1
, provided. Next, banks
produce commercial loans, y2
. Securities are the third output, y3
. A bank uses three
production factors to produce outputs. These are fixed assets, x1
, labour, x2
, and total
borrowed funds, x3
. These in- and output categories represent the most frequently used
ones in the literature. But note as a caveat that across different banks the quality of inputs

may differ systematically.14 Also, especially large banks produce outputs such as custody
and advisory services that are not explicitly specified here. As far as the data permits, we
therefore account for a number of systematic differences across banks of different pillars,
region and further characteristics as discussed below in our empirical specification.
A bank faces an input price vector of wi
, where i indexes the input used. As the calculation
of these input prices is at the core of this paper, we devote the next sub-section to a
discussion of our baseline and alternative models. In transforming inputs into outputs, we
account for the role of equity, z, as an alternative to fund outputs (Hughes and Mester,
1993). The transformation function of the banking firm is depicted by T(y,x,z). Note that
this implies the assumption that all banks employ the same production technology. We
assume therefore that a single federal frontier can be estimated for German banks.15 We
employ total operating cost, TOC, as dependent variable in the cost minimisation problem
and profits before tax, PBT, in the alternative profit maximisation problem.16 We assume
that banks are price takers in input markets. To produce a given vector of outputs y, banks
minimise cost by choosing input quantities xi
at given input prices, wi
. Using these
definitions, the cost minimisation problem is written as17

14 For example, investment bankers at large commercial banks are a different input compared to relatively
low-skilled labour employed at branches of regionally active small banks. Unfortunately, the available data
does not allow for a more detailed granularity of inputs according to such quality differentials.
15 Alternatively, one could estimate separate frontiers per group. But that approach suffers from the
incomparableness of efficiency measures from different frontiers and the ultimate arbitrariness of "correct"
groups. Instead, we choose here to adjust the frontier for systematic differences across banks.
16 To conserve on space we illustrate here only the cost minimisation problem. The alternative profit model
by Humphrey and Pulley (1997) is similar and we refer to differences via footnotes.
17 In the alternative profit model, banks possess pricing power on the output side. The pricing opportunity set
is H(p,y,w,z), where p denotes output prices, and constitutes an additional constraint next to technology.

demand functions into the total cost function given by equation (1), resulting in19

If truly exogenous prices under perfect competition are available, any empirical
specification of equation (3) suffers from identification problems.20 However, we assume
that input prices can differ between banks due to some degree of market imperfections. In
fact, the vast majority of studies make this assumption implicitly. In the most extreme case,
banks can set prices in input markets. Consequently, they would minimise cost by
choosing prices wi
that they are willing to pay for given amounts of input.21 Here, we
abstain from these extreme assumptions. Instead, we focus on the magnitude of potentially
distorted efficiency measures due to the use of traditional proxy variables. We therefore
turn next to our suggestion as how to obtain alternative input price measures.
3.2 Input price measurement
In the cost model, the factor prices for inputs, wi
, are exogenous variables.22 They are
assumed to be determined in their respective factor markets and enter the production model
in section 3.1 as given. Then, utilisation of observed equilibrium factor market prices
would be strictly speaking the correct choice to empirically specify equation (3).
But due to the lack of such data, researchers employ according to Greene (1993) proxy
variables that represent appropriate measures of theoretical counterparts. Ideally, we would
therefore use observed contractual wage rates for the price of labour, rental prices per
square metre of office space and interest rates per unit of borrowed funds, respectively. But
18 The profit maximisation problem yields, in addition, optimal output prices p*(y,w,z).
19 Accordingly, maximum profits, *(y,w,z), depend only on exogenously determined input prices and
available equity to produce a given output. This curbs the frequently encountered lack of available output
prices. It allows thereby to evaluate banks' success to realise opportunities in output markets.
20 In a given year, input prices are in such a case constant and could not be disentangled from the intercept.
21 We also test empirically if banks minimise cost with respect to prices. Then, an optimal cost function
C*(y,xi
,z) depends on input quantities rather than prices. Also, we followed Mountain and Thomas (1999)
and simply dropped the wi
's entirely, leaving us with an optimum cost function depending on output
quantities and equity C*(y,z), only. These specifications were not estimable due to collinearity or residuals
exhibiting a skew that contradicted the requirements of cost and/or profit inefficiency to prevail (Waldmann
(1982)). This suggests that the respective specifications are inappropriate.
22 The same holds throughout for the alternative profit model.
- 7 -
such data are usually also unavailable.23 To obtain input price proxies, most studies (e.g.
Altunbas et al. (2001), Lang and Welzel (1996)) calculate input prices per bank.
Our baseline model, model 1, mimics this traditional approach. For each bank, we obtain
the price of fixed assets, w1
, by dividing depreciation and other expenditure on fixed assets
over the volume of fixed assets. The price of labour is calculated as an average wage rate,
w2
, by relating the Euro amount of personnel expenses to the number of full-time
equivalent employees (FTE). Finally, we approximate the price of borrowed funds, w3
, by
dividing interest expenses over total borrowed funds.
We suggest to derive alternative input prices by an approach akin to Berger and Mester
(2003). We rely on the indications provided by studies on German banking and define
markets, m, in terms of region and banking type. In the first alternative input price model,
model 2, we assume that all banks operate on regional markets. In the second alternative
price model, model 3, we assume that large banks compete on a federal market.24
Consider the market for fixed assets first. In model 2, a bank that is restricted to branch in a
certain region will naturally rent physical assets in the vicinity. It competes for real estate
with other banks also branching in this particular region.25 On the one hand, it is a safe
assumption for small banks that office equipment or main administrative real estate is only
demanded on the regional market. On the other hand, one might object to this definition of
an input market on grounds of nationwide operations of large banks. In fact, large banks
might set-up regional administrative centres only where prices are most favourable.
Therefore, we assume in model 3 that large banks constitute one federal market for real
estate on which they compete with each other. On this federal market, then, each bank
faces exogenous rather than traditionally employed endogenous input prices.
With respect to labour, we assume that the majority of banks draw from regional labour
pools. We assume that the labour force in Germany is not flexible enough to move from,
say, Bavaria to Bremen to conduct standardised banking tasks. In model 2, we therefore
assume that the majority of employees are recruited in the respective region. However, we
assert that highly specialised tasks like risk management, investment banking or financial
engineering require experts. This highly skilled labour force is probably readily willing to
23 In addition, there are at times substantial conceptual problems as to what the respective measurement units
are. For example, interest paid does not cover all costs associated with borrowed money as fees are neglected.
24 This group comprises large commercial banks, apex institutions of savings and cooperatives and Postbank.
- 8 -
move. We assume the majority of such highly specialised tasks are conducted either by
comparatively large banks or the respective apex institutions on behalf of their local banks.
Therefore, we construct in model 3 prices for labour to originate from a federal market for
large banks as above. In contrast, all other banks continue to recruit locally.
Finally, the market for borrowed funds may depend to a larger extent on local conditions
than one expects. We know from various monthly reports of the Bundesbank that the
primary sources of funding are for most banks customer deposits. In model 2, we therefore
argue that in demanding funds, for example, a local commercial bank faces competition
primarily from the savings bank next door. But in contrast to small banks, large institutes
rely more intensively on securitised debt and interbank lending. This lower dependence on
a local customer base induces us to apply in model 3 the previous logic of one federal
market for large banks.
Summing up, we treat each bank in model 1 to operate in its own market. In model 2, we
specify exogenous input prices on the basis of regional markets. We use available regional
identifiers for each bank and define counties as regional markets. In contrast, we assume in
model 3 that large banks compete on one federal input market.
Next, we suggest how to derive input price proxies per market. We argue that the prices
banks face can be approximated by the average price paid for an input factor in the market.
This implies utilisation of average input prices, wi
, per county for all banks in model 2. In
model 3, we use the average paid by large banks from one federal market as input price
proxies. Because banks face prices, these market-specific averages are calculated for each
bank excluding the bank itself. Table 1 illustrates the different calculations for the
benchmark and a market model with an example for labour.
Let wik
denote input prices for each bank, where k=1,..,K indexes a bank and K is the total
number of banks in a market.26 We denote markets by m=1,..,M, where M depicts the total
number of markets, i.e. counties. In the example above we have four markets m in total, as
exhibited by the fourth column in table 1. Each contains three banks, respectively.
25 Note, that the true market price for real estate, and all other inputs, also depends on the demand of other
agents. Unfortunately, we do not have according data at our disposal.

The benchmark case can be regarded as modelling each bank as a market of its own, i.e.
the number of banks equals the number of markets, K=M. This is illustrated in table 1
under the heading Benchmark model. Alternatively, we calculate the input price proxy as
the average market price excluding the bank's own position. The optimum cost function,
then, employs for each bank the average price of all other banks in the region. More
formally, a bank l in market m faces a price of

/( . To illustrate this
procedure for one market, consider the three rightmost columns under the heading Market
model. Within market m=1, the first bank, k=1, faces an input price equal to the average
input price paid by the remaining banks in the market, i.e. banks k=3, 5. This procedure
leaves the average input price paid by all banks unaffected. However, the variation of input
prices is reduced as can be seen from the last row in table 1. Intuitively, the closer the
market resembles perfect competition, the lower the variation, because price differences
ultimately approach zero until a single market-clearing price prevails.
We discuss next the empirical and intuitive implications of this approach with regard to the
estimated level of efficiency. Recall that in model 1 we explain on the left-hand side (LHS)
the observed total cost with an observed output vector and some proxies for input prices on

= . One can argue that this amounts to employing a scaled
fraction of total cost on the RHS in order to explain the total on the LHS.
Thus, we would expect a high explanatory power because the RHS variables are basically
extracted from the LHS. By definition, the numerators of our ratio that should approximate
true equilibrium prices sum to the LHS (or at least to the major share of it). Hence, for a
bank with input prices substantially above average, employed variables still explain a lot of
the observed total costs by construction. Thereby, total error would be underestimated,
which is crucial for SFA. This is because efficiency is extracted from this total error.
Therefore, our suggested approach to derive proxy variables for equilibrium input prices
emphasises the deviations of banks' factor costs over quantities from what other banks
have paid under similar conditions. It is perceivable that a frontier using market prices is
less suited to explain observed costs, as those proxies are actually not directly derived from
the LHS observation. Then, the fit of the frontier might deteriorate. This would imply that
the total error of our estimation increases. Given the parametric nature of SFA, we assume
ex ante that a certain portion of the error distribution, i.e. deviations from the benchmark,
is due to inefficiency (Coelli et al., 1998). Then, a higher total error leads us to expect
higher levels of inefficiency, too.27 Therefore, we expect higher levels of inefficiency for
models 2 and 3 compared to model 1 if it is true that total error increases when using
alternative input price proxies.
Apart from the level of efficiency, a major strength of SFA is the ability to rank firms.
Therefore, we are particularly interested in the distribution of efficiency scores in order to
identify best and worst in class banks. Note that according to our alternative input price
proxies, those banks that paid the highest price within their market are now modelled to
face substantially lower prices (and vice versa). This is appealing because for a bank that
incurred high total costs on the left hand side we now employ a market price, which is
substantially lower. Recall that for such a bank the high implicit input price emerged
probably from dividing high factor payments by relatively small factor quantities
employed. We could flip the problem around and state that the bank has paid for that
27 As in Kumbhakar et al (1991), we incorporate environmental factors directly. This implies an offsetting
effect. We expect that alleviating a potentially omitted variable bias improves estimation (Mester, 1997).

amount of input a too high price relative to what competitors have paid. In the benchmark
model this need not imply huge inefficiency, as input prices per bank are ultimately
derived from total cost of this bank only and, in turn, explain a lot of the LHS by
construction. In the alternative approach, however, this bank would be labelled inefficient
because it incurred the same (too high) costs, while facing a market price considerably
below its own factor payment per factor quantity.
In sum, we assume in this paper that markets can be defined in terms of regions. The price
a bank faces to purchase its inputs is determined in these markets. For each bank, k, this
price is the average of prices paid by all other banks in that market excluding the bank's
own price. The specification of exogenous input prices should not only affect the level of
efficiency, but also the distribution of efficiency scores. Next, we introduce the empirical
specification to estimate a reduced form of equation (3).
3.3 Empirical specification
We follow Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) and use a stochastic frontier model that
accommodates heterogeneity. To estimate a reduced form of equation (3), we rely largely
on established procedures to measure the effects of misspecified input prices as directly as
possible.28 As in Lang and Welzel (1996), we employ a multi-output translog function and
include time trend variables to capture technical change to estimate a federal cost frontier.
For any bank, k, this cost function takes on the form29

Thereby, we reduce the total error and the level of inefficiency. Which of the two effects, accounting for
heterogeneity versus alternative price proxy measurement, dominates, remains an empirical question.

29 In the alternative profit model, we employ lnPBT as dependent variable.

As outlined in section 3.1, wi
denotes input prices, ym
denotes outputs and z depicts the
level of equity capital.30 We substitute, input prices wi
, from the three respective market
definitions discussed in section 3.2 to investigate the effects on efficiency levels, rankings
and robustness of estimation results. To measure inefficiency, we assume a composed error
term in equation (4). The error term, k
, consists partly of random noise, vk
, and partly of
inefficiency, uk
. For a cost frontier, inefficiency implies above frontier costs. Therefore,
inefficiency enters the error term with a positive sign, leading to k
= vk
+ uk
.31
In addition, we follow Bos et al. (2004) and specify a vector of exogenous factors, hk
.
These environmental and bank-specific factors capture systematic differences between the
different banks in our sample. We assume that these sources of heterogeneity influence the
distribution of deviations from the efficient frontier. Kumbhakar et al. (1991) suggest a
single-stage approach to allow hk
to influence the mean of the inefficiency distribution.32
We specify hk
to contain four variables and three dummies.33 The first variable accounts
for findings reviewed by Berger (2003) that efficiency varies across banks of different size.
We therefore include the log of total assets, TA. Another characteristic difference between
alternative banking groups refers to the risk associated with banks' balance sheet assets. To
capture the regulatory risk, we therefore construct a ratio, RISK, that relates total risk
weighted assets to gross total assets.34 Clark and Siems (2002) point out that banks
increasingly engage in off-balance sheet activities, OBS, and therefore we include the log
of OBS in the inefficiency term, too. The rationale to do so is that banks increasingly
attempt to manage various risks actively with these instruments.35 Finally, we explicitly
account for variations in the respective county's bank market structure. We employ a
Hirschman-Herfindahl index, HHI, per year and county on the basis of total gross assets as
to measure concentration and competitiveness.36 The remaining terms that are included in
hk
are dummy variables for the banking groups of local savings and cooperatives. Thereby,
we account for systematic differences, such as e.g. previously mentioned quality
30 Upon estimation, we impose the required restrictions of linear homogeneity in input prices and symmetry
of cross-partial derivatives of the conditional factor demand functions as in Lang and Welzel (1996).
31 For the profit frontier, inefficiency reduces profits and is therefore subtracted, leading to k
= vk
- uk
.
32 For a discussion of the various pitfalls of first estimating efficiency and then exposing it to a set of
explanatory variables see Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000).
33 Our choice is based on results from the literature and talks to practitioners at the Bundesbank.
34 The risk weights follow the 1988 Basle Accord.
35 Clark and Siems (2002) specify OBS as part of the efficient frontier. Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) call it a
judgement if a variable influences the technology that determines the frontier or deviations from it. We
considered both ways and decided on the basis of log-likelihood values to specify them to influence the latter.

differences of inputs across banking groups. The final dummy variable identifies banks
located in the East. This way we accommodate less buoyant real economic conditions. We
provide descriptive statistics on SFA and heterogeneity variables in the next sub-section.
As in Kumbhakar et al. (1991), we assume the random error term vk
to be i.i.d. with
vk
~ N(0,  2
v
) and independent of the explanatory variables. The inefficiency term is
uk
~ |N[(a0
+d' hk
), 2
u
]|, where d' is a vector of parameters to be estimated. We use OLS
estimates as starting values when maximising the likelihood function, derived by Aigner et
al. (1977). We employ their re-parameterisation of =u
/v
and  2= 2
u
+ 2
v
.
Consequently,  indicates the ratio of standard deviation attributable to inefficiency
relative to the standard deviation due to random noise. An insignificant estimate of 
means that no inefficiency prevails. All of the error is due to random noise and
specification of a stochastic frontier model is inappropriate.

Note an important implication of this procedure to obtain efficiency estimates with regard
to the interpretation of individual coefficients estimated for hk
. A positive coefficient for a
heterogeneity variable hi
for bank k implies a higher mean value for the truncated
inefficiency distribution, f(u). It, however, need not imply a higher inefficiency score for
bank k. This is because the latter is conditional on the total error, k
. While the effect of an
increase of hi
implies a higher mean of f(u), total error for this bank, k
, might be
sufficiently small to still result in a lower than mean efficiency for the individual firm. Put
differently, the effect of an exogenous variable's influence on efficiency depends not only
on the influence on the truncated distribution, but also on the position (and shape) of the
distribution of total error. To evaluate the effect of an exogenous variable, hik
, on
efficiency, Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) suggest to use the derivative of the conditional
mean of the inefficiency term with respect to the exogenous factor, i.e. [E(uk
|k
)/hik
]. In
our result section, we are primarily interested in whether our choice of h is significant and
how the entirety of exogenous factors influence efficiency. Therefore, we do not
investigate marginal effects but focus on differences of efficiency scores across models.

Efficiency measures take on values between 0 and 1. The latter indicates a fully efficient
bank. The value indicates which percentage of observed cost would have been enough to
produce the observed output if the bank was fully efficient. Firm-specific efficiency
estimates further allow us to analyse if rankings are sensitive to measurement error. We
turn next to a brief description of the employed data.
4 Data
For the years 1993 to 2003, we use data from unconsolidated, annual balance sheets, profit
and loss accounts and audit reports either reported to or compiled by the supervision
department of the Bundesbank. The data comprise 32,211 observations on commercial,
savings and cooperative banks. Table 2 depicts descriptive statistics of both variables used
in the deterministic kernel and those accounting for heterogeneity in the error.

Two issues in table 2 deserve attention. First, the distribution of both SFA and
heterogeneity variables clearly illustrate the differences across firms in our sample. For
example, some banks only had outstanding loans on the order of some thousand Euro. In
contrast, the largest bank recorded a position of outstanding commercial loans worth  315
billion in a single year. With respect to input prices the standard deviation and extreme

]. This measure indicates the percentage of
actual profits relative to what the bank could have realised given its input quantity and output price mix.

values underline potential measurement problems. It is hard to believe that the observed
maxima of input prices, wi
, accurately reflect the competitive position of a bank. Hence, an
alternative to approximate input market prices seems warranted.
Second, the "implausible" values for input prices may be due to faulty data. Some studies
exclude extreme observations. But Maudos et al. (2002) caution that this cure may be
worse than the disease. They argue that any truncation point is ultimately arbitrary. Given
the exceptional quality of our data, our concerns of this kind are limited. Only around 150
out of 32,211 observations exhibit input prices for fixed assets and/or borrowed funds
above a 100 percent.38 As a check we exclude extreme observations for a range of cut-off
points. Results are qualitatively not affected. This underpins the ability of stochastic
frontier analysis to accommodate random error appropriately for this sample.
In sum, a comparison of bank performance should consider measurement error, random
noise and heterogeneity in a more explicit manner. Consideration of random noise is at the
very heart of stochastic frontier analysis. We take heterogeneity into account by specifying
a range of bank-specific factors in addition to the standard production plan used in most
studies. To address the issue of appropriate input prices we employ our alternatives
discussed above. Therefore, we turn next to our empirical results to assess the impact of
this measurement error on efficiency measures.
5 Results
In this section, we present estimation results for CE and PE from models 1 through 3. First,
we discuss cost and, second, profit frontier estimations. For each, we compare the
benchmark model 1 and alternative input price models 2 and 3, respectively. Subsequently,
we compare efficiency results across region and banking groups. Third, we compare
efficiency to traditional KPI, identify extreme performers and describe their characteristics.
5.1 Cost frontier
We start by discussing cost estimation results, continue with an inspection of regional
differences of CE and close with a CE comparison between banks from alternative sectors.
38 Note also that around 75 percent of these extreme observations are banks located in the East. These banks
may enjoy special tax breaks meant to subsidise structurally weaker regions. For example, if a tax-
minimising firm books high depreciation, this can lead to "implausible" prices for fixed assets because the
numerator of w3
is inflated. But such a bank is certainly still in operation in the market. Therefore, it should
be considered in a benchmark. Exclusion may in fact bias efficiency measures as well.

5.1.1 Estimation results and cost efficiency
Table 3 depicts parameter estimates for cost frontiers according to models 1 through 3. We
employ the cost of borrowed funds, w3
, to impose homogeneity as in Lang and Welzel
(1996). Most parameter estimates are significant. Due to interaction terms, the
interpretation of single coefficients of the deterministic kernel is not straightforward. We
therefore abstain from any conclusions of this kind.
Individual coefficients that account for heterogeneity in the inefficiency distribution, h, are
also significantly different from zero. Therefore, not all non-random deviations from the
frontier are due to the inability to employ resources in optimal proportions. Specification of
a set of explanatory variables that influence the truncated distribution of inefficiency
improves the fit significantly.39 But as the effect on efficiency depends ultimately on total
error we abstain from the interpretation of single coefficients. Instead, we concentrate on
two issues. First, whether accounting for heterogeneity leaves any further systematic
deviations that are identified as inefficiency. Second, to assess the change in efficiency due
to the use of alternative input prices.
Regarding the former consider the estimate of , the ratio of the standard deviation
attributable to inefficiency to the standard deviation due to random noise. The parameter is
significantly different from zero in both the benchmark and all alternative models. We
therefore conclude that inefficiency prevails even after accounting for heterogeneity and
no matter how input prices are proxied. Parameter estimates of  and  in model 1 are
substantially larger compared to both alternative price models. This indicates that the
distribution of estimated inefficiencies is influenced by the use of alternative input prices.
To quantify the differences in efficiency scores, table 4 provides descriptive statistics of
CE estimates according to the three models.

39 We reject a log-likelihood ratio test that all heterogeneity parameters are simultaneously equal to zero at
the 1% level.

Mean cost inefficiency according to model 1 is on the order of 8 percent. This is less than
the 20 percent often found in the literature. However, it is in line with studies that also
account for heterogeneity and thereby disentangle CE from random noise on the one hand,
and other exogenous factors on the other. The standard deviation and skew in the
benchmark model indicate that many banks are located fairly close to the frontier.
However, the performance is diverse as underlined by a difference between best- and
worst-performing banks of 42.4 percent. We hypothesised earlier that alternative input
price measures affect the level and distribution of CE.
Mean CE in model 2 confirms this notion. It is five percent below the efficiency score in
model 1. The difference between best- and worst-performing banks increases. This
indicates that model 2 identifies extreme performing banks with more emphasis. At the
same time, alternative market price proxies locate the majority of banks close to full
efficiency. But worst performing banks are further away from full efficiency as compared
to the benchmark model. This explains lower industry average CE compared to the
benchmark case. The use of exogenous input prices seems to highlight extreme performers.
A reason could be that in perfect markets healthy banks gravitate to market averages while
those banks close to market exit stand out more clearly as poor performers.
Other studies report that large banks are less efficient than small banks. This result could
partly be due to measurement error if these banks operate on one federal rather than on
multiple regional markets. In model 3, we account for this possibility and calculate input
price proxies accordingly. Qualitatively, the results between models 2 and 3 do not differ
substantially. Mean CE slightly improves to 87.7 percent, thus being around four percent
below the benchmark case.
In addition to altered mean efficiency levels, we find that CE rankings are affected by the
use of alternative input prices. Rank-order correlations between model 1 and the two
alternative models 2 and 3 are 80.4% and 82%, respectively.40 As rankings are not
perfectly correlated, we conclude that our alternative price proxies do not identify the same
banks as best and worst performers.41 We will address the issue in section 5.3. Beforehand,
we identify CE differences between banks of different regions and banking type.
40 Measured by Spearman's , significant at the 1% level.
41 Differences of CE ranks between models 2 and 3 are negligible given a rank order correlation of 98.9%.

5.1.2 Cost efficiency across regions
Table 5 depicts differences of mean CE for each model per state. We compare CE to the
ratio of general administrative expenses to the raw result, the CI ratio. The last line reports
a rank-sum test statistic if efficiency measures are significantly different from each other.

Two major conclusions arise. First, the CI ratio yields by and large similar rankings as CE
measures. However, some differences prevail. For example, those states hosting most of
the small cooperative banks, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria, are according to all CE
measures ranked first and second. In turn, based on the CI ratio the former state is ranked
3rd and the latter is ranked 4th. Two potential implications arise. On the one hand, CE
measures might simply be wrong and therefore useless. The ability to demand input
quantities in correct proportions subject to prevailing prices does not matter for the
economic success of banks. We find this interpretation hard to believe. Alternatively,
Bauer et al. (1998) suggest that efficiency measures contain additional information
compared to CI ratios. For example, if increasing competition squeezes interest margins for
all banks in the market, CI ratios naturally rise. However, how well a single bank
converted inputs into outputs cannot be assessed from CI ratios alone.
- 20 -
The second inference from table 5 is confirmation of an "East" effect. All new states yield
mean CE significantly below the federal average. Whether this result is due to
systematically lower managerial skills or due to structural deficiencies not captured by a
simple dummy variable remains at this stage unclear.
In sum, western states host many top performing banks in terms of CE. Banks in eastern
states perform below average. CE scores may contain additional information that
complement traditional KPI, such as the CI ratio.
5.1.3 Cost efficiency across banking groups
We analyse next to what extent CE scores differ across banking groups. Mean CE
differences between different banking groups in our three models are reported in table 6.

percent.
* Significant at the 1% level.
For all three models the difference in means is significant. In model 1, large banks are
located far away from the frontier, while for small banks the opposite holds. Average
potential savings per bank and year are  8.9 million. Total average annual savings amount
to  25.5 billion for all banks in our sample.42 For large banks, average CE amounts to 87.2
percent according to model 1. Consequently, the share of foregone Euro amounts in terms
of potential savings accrues to  15.4 billion. This implies that 60 percent of foregone
producer surplus originates from large banks. Note that in relative terms, i.e. by means of
efficiency scores alone, large banks perform only 4 percent worse than the overall industry

) * TOCkt
].

average. But assessing the lost Euro value reveals that the costs to society due to cost
inefficiencies of large banks are greatest.43
This result is amplified when using alternative input price proxies. In model 2, large bank
CE differences relative to savings and cooperatives widens from 15 percent in model 1 to
19 and 21 percent, respectively. Compared to regional commercial banks, the difference is
even inverted. In contrast to model 1, large banks suffer the most from inefficiency on the
input side. Lower mean industry efficiency with an over-proportionate waste identified
with big banks implies that annual average savings per bank increase almost by a factor 2.5
to  22 million. Accordingly, the total of potential annual savings increase to  61.6 billion.
The share of potential savings for the group of large banks increases to 72 percent, equal to
 44.5 billion. Results therefore confirm earlier findings in the literature (e.g. Altunbas et
al., 2001) that especially large banks suffer from inefficiencies.
Model 3 accounts for the possibility that demanded inputs differ substantially between
banks, e.g. due to different quality of labour demanded, by assuming single federal input
markets for this group. This model alleviates the shortcomings of large commercial banks
found previously. While still identified as the worst performing banking group in
Germany, CE differences relative to the federal average are reduced from 20 percent in
model 2 to 13 percent in model 3. Annual average savings across all bank types are on the
order of  17.8 million. Excessive total costs incurred compared to fully efficient use of
inputs sum to  50.9 billion. While lower than identified inefficiencies in model 2, it is
worth noting that the share of large banks still scores an impressive 68 percent. Therefore,
the conclusion that large banks are most cost inefficient is robust across all three models.
Likewise, we find that small banks exhibit superior cost management skills.44
In sum, the use of alternative input prices leads to lower mean CE. From a regional angle,
all models yield CE that (i) is significantly different across states, (ii) is lowest in eastern
states (and to a lesser extent city states) and (iii) yields additional information compared to
43 Mean TOC for large banks is  6,170 million but only around  82.9 million and  13.6 million for savings
and cooperative banks, respectively. A 10 basis point improvement in CE at an average large bank thus
requires approximately a 45 percent improvement in CE for an average cooperative bank.
44 Note that some activities of large banks, e.g. custody or advisory services, may not be included sufficiently
in the specified output vector. This could imply comparably high costs for large banks and hence to low CE.
But if omitted outputs cause low CE for large banks, we would expect that they exhibit above average PE as
profits would be comparably high without the burden of corresponding products specified in the frontier. The
mean PE estimates across banking groups discussed in section 5.2.3 show that this is not the case. Given this
result in addition to our approach to adjust the frontier for heterogeneity and the consistency with the
literature, we are confident that our results are robust. Ideally, we are able to obtain additional data on output
proxies to empirically test alternative production specifications in future research.
- 22 -
traditional KPI. From a bank sector angle, the evidence of all models suggests that large
banks suffer most from cost inefficiency. It simply matters if a small cooperative wastes 20
percent of actual cost or if a large bank does. Note, however, that out of 231 large bank
observations, only 39 refer to commercial banks. The remainder are either cooperative or
saving banks' apex institutions or Postbank. Large commercial banks certainly did not
excel in terms of efficiency. But the largest share of "wasteful" banking business on the
input side occurred with large apex institutions of cooperative banks. We turn next to PE.
5.2 Alternative profit frontier
Alternative PE indicates the percentage of realised profits relative to profits that could have
been realised. First, we provide estimation results and mean PE per model. Second, we
discuss regional PE differences and, third, between banking groups.
5.2.1 Estimation results and alternative profit efficiency
Table 7 presents parameter estimates for the three efficient profit frontiers, respectively.
No estimation reached the maximum number of iterations when maximising the likelihood.
Parameter estimates of the deterministic kernel are by and large significantly different from
zero. This implies that a stochastic profit frontier is superior to OLS. We conclude that
profit inefficiencies prevail, but abstain as before from the interpretation of single
coefficients. While substantially higher compared to the cost case, both  and  are
significantly different from zero, too. We conclude that profit inefficiencies prevail and
expect PE to be more dispersed than CE.

Most parameters of the specified heterogeneity variables are also significant. The direction
and magnitude of these effects is stable across models. As in section 5.1, we limit
ourselves to note that accounting for heterogeneity is necessary to disentangle "managerial
inefficiency" from other influences. Contrary to the cost case, however, the specification of
alternative input prices leaves the magnitude of both error and heterogeneity parameters
largely unaffected.45 Consequently, PE appears to be relatively insensitive to alternative
input price measurement.
We turn therefore next to an assessment of efficiency differences across models, states and
sectors. Table 8 illustrates the similarity of PE scores for the three models employed.
Table 8: Mean profit efficiency estimates 1993 - 2003
PE Mean SD Skew Kurt Min Max N
Model 1 0.647 0.177 -0.902 3.081 0.216 0.959 32,211
Model 2 0.647 0.174 -0.926 3.183 0.216 0.959 32,211
Model 3 0.643 0.174 -0.897 3.120 0.216 0.959 32,211
Mean alternative PE is substantially lower compared to CE, around 65 percent. An average
bank could have realised a third more profits relative to actually accrued profits. In relative
terms, profit outweighs cost inefficiency. Regarding the distribution of PE most banks are
no longer located close to the frontier. Many banks are far below best practice behaviour.
Also, the distribution of PE hardly changes across models. Consequently, sub-optimal
behaviour on the input side is of lesser importance for PE. Most of the estimated profit
inefficiencies seem to arise from sub-optimal output choices.
Standard deviations and extreme values further indicate that the dispersion of PE is larger
compared to CE. Best and worst performing firms differ by as much as 70 percent.
Potentially, this larger difference is due to a higher volatility of earnings compared to
costs.46 To this end, we investigated whether poor performers in one year tended to be
good performers in another. This is not the case ­ banks exhibiting a poor ability to realise
their chances in output markets do so consistently over time. Thus, the fundamental ability
of banks to realise profits is more diverse compared to CE.
45 For example, neither  nor  vary much. We observe only a slight improvement of  in models 2 and 3.
Therefore, the explanatory power benefits only marginally from our alternative input price proxies.
46 Consider as an example two banks that engage in riskier production plans. Let the two banks speculate on
foreign exchange appreciation and depreciation, respectively. Depending on what "bet" materialises, this
yields one very profit-efficient and one markedly inefficient bank. In contrast, on the expense side of the
income statement, interest rates, wages and rents are specified in contracts and are therefore less volatile.
- 25 -
5.2.2 Alternative profit efficiency across regions
To examine the geographical pattern of PE, consider table 9 below. Alternative mean PE
levels are more stable across specifications compared to CE. Also, all states are ranked
almost identically. The distortion of PE due to measurement error seems negligible. At the
same time, regional differences of both PE measures and KPI ratios are significant. 47

The negative "East" effect identified for the cost frontier is inverted. By and large,
estimated PE of banks located in eastern states is higher compared to western
competitors.48 However, a more differentiated view is warranted. Of the five new states
(excluding Berlin for now), Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia are ranked the top three in
terms of alternative PE. The two remaining eastern states, Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania and Saxony-Anhalt, perform only mediocrely with a mean PE of around 65
percent. Thus, it may be overly simplistic to refer to "the East".
47 As in section 5.1, we provide here the comparison to traditional accounting-based performance indicators.
48 This contradicts results obtained from a predecessor study based on Bankscope data. There, we concluded
that further studies need to incorporate systematic differences, e.g. macroeconomic conditions. In this study,
we adjust the benchmark frontier for factors causing heterogeneity. As inference changes substantially, we
once more underline the necessity to account for exogenous factors in efficiency studies.
- 26 -
With respect to the additional information contained in PE estimates relative to KPI we
find that a number of states are assigned similar rankings by all measures in table 9.49 But
as in the cost case some differences exist. For example, ROE and ROA rank eastern states
differently. Thus, our previous conclusion that efficiency measures contain additional
information is underlined.
Next, we discuss systematic PE differences across banking groups and link inefficiency
scores to Euro amounts of foregone profits.
5.2.3 Alternative profit efficiency across banking groups
Mean PE estimates suggested that alternative input price proxies do not matter much. We
argue in table 10 that it might indeed matter especially if large banks are affected.

* Significant at the 1% level.
Table 10 illustrates that mean PE of large banks improves when alternative input prices are
used in models 2 and 3 compared to the benchmark model. It is possible that especially the
latter model grasps quality differences of inputs between large, nationally operating banks
and small regional institutes more appropriately. Nonetheless, despite improvements of 4.4
and 1.5 percent, respectively, large banks exhibit the worst PE measures in all models.
Opportunity costs of foregone profits are highest for large banks. These account for 57
percent of total annual potential savings of  22.7 billion (i.e.  13 billion).50 Annual
profits foregone for the average bank are  6.8 million. In comparison, the equivalent value
for large banks stood at  623 million. As with wasted cost savings, improvements in large
49 Examples are the states Saarland, Schleswig-Holstein and Berlin.
50 We calculate total annual profits forgone according to the sum of optimal profits for each bank less the sum
of actually realised profits, i.e. kt
(PBTkt
/ PEkt
- PBTkt
).
- 27 -
bank PE thus entail the largest gains due to (i) the highest relative inefficiency and (ii) the
largest volume of potentially foregone producer surplus.51
In sum, the differences between relative inefficiency scores (8.5% cost versus 35.3% profit
inefficiency) are put into perspective when absolute amounts of potential savings are
examined. Then, the absolute savings potential in terms of foregone profits is of a similar
order compared to excessive costs ( 25.5 billion cost vs.  22.7 billion profit savings). To
obtain a complete picture of performance, we should therefore assess absolute savings, too.
A remaining matter of interest is to gauge similarities and differences of identified extreme
performing banks according to the various alternative indicators discussed so far.
5.3 Comparing efficiency
First, we compare CE and PE with each other and to traditional KPI. Second, we
investigate the degree to which the three efficiency models identify similar (or different)
extreme performers. Third, we turn our attention to these groups' respective characteristics.
5.3.1 Efficiency and accounting based KPI
Table 11 below depicts correlation coefficients between our six efficiency measures and
the various KPI displayed throughout. In line with Bauer et al. (1998), correlation
coefficients between KPI and both CE and PE estimates are low and exhibit only miniscule
changes across the three different SFA models.52

51 Note in line with footnote 44 that large banks exhibit the lowest PE despite earning profits with products
and services that may not be explicitly accounted for in the production plan, e.g. custody and advisory
services. In line with the argument raised earlier, we therefore regard our CE and PE results as robust.
52 It is also well known that CE and PE are weakly correlated as they measure different sorts of efficiency.
Correlation coefficients are significant at 12.4%, 15.4% and 15.1% in models 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

In the upper panel of table 11, correlation coefficients between CE and KPI ratios are low.
Potentially, this reflects that traditional KPI can suffer from influences due to accounting
and reporting rules.53 This is in line with our interpretation that CE conveys additional
information compared to traditional KPI.
The middle panel displays correlation coefficients between PE measures and KPI.
Magnitudes are low, especially between the CI ratio and PE. With respect to profitability
measures, correlations are higher. Yet, they are far from perfect. We conclude therefore
that PE measures also contain additional information.
The lower panel underpins that already within the group of traditional KPI correlation is
low. For example, the correlation coefficient between the CI ratio and the net interest
margin is close to zero. Also note that the former KPI is positively correlated with e.g.
ROA and ROE. But intuitively we would expect a profitable bank to be cost efficient, too.
Apparently, alternative accounting based KPI already contain different information.
In line with Bauer et al (1998) we conclude that multiple indicators convey different
information. Not only the correlation between efficiency measures and KPI is low. Also,
correlation between various traditional KPI is low. Therefore, low correlation between CE,
PE and KPI is per se no reason to discard efficiency measures as an indicator. Instead,
efficiency may be useful as a complementary KPI.54 We turn next to the influence of
alternative input prices on the identification of extreme performers.
5.3.2 Identification of extreme performers
Usually, we are less interested in identifying a single "winner" or "loser". Rather, we like
to identify groups of top and flop performers. Hence, we investigate how alternative input
price proxies affect the composition of the highest and lowest performing deciles of banks.
To this end, consider table 12. We compare on the basis of CE and PE how banks in the
best and worst deciles of model 1 are re-ranked when input prices are measured differently.
These two cohorts are referred to as top and flop deciles, respectively. We report the decile
distribution of both cohorts according to model 2 and 3, respectively.
53 For example, special depreciation rules to subsidise regions or industries may result in "extreme" KPI.
54 It is beyond the scope of this study to qualify the importance of this additional information. However,
Koetter et al. (2004) find that efficiency is a significant determinant of distressed and non-distressed mergers.

Note: Frequencies in percent.
The left panel in table 12 compares the distribution of top and flop performers in model 1
across efficiency rank deciles of model 2. The best performing banks according to model 1
are depicted in the first two columns. Between 74 (CE) and 94 (PE) percent of banks
identified as role models in the traditional model are identically identified as top
performers when alternative input prices are used. This result indicates that efficiency
studies using implicit prices arrive at similar conclusions for the majority of banks.
However, note that a quarter of those banks formerly regarded as potential role models
regarding CE are now re-ranked in decile eight or below. Most importantly, approximately
2 percent of all identified CE top performers are ranked diametrically opposed in deciles
one and two. Such drastic re-classifications are absent for PE rankings. This confirms that
PE is hardly affected by alternative input prices.
Banks with the worst efficiency scores under traditional SFA analysis are compared to
model 2 in the third and fourth columns of the left-hand side panel. The cumulative share
of identically identified flop performers in deciles one and two is even higher, ranging
between 92 (CE) and 98 (PE) percent. One percent of banks switch into the best
performing CE deciles nine and ten after adjusting for implicit input prices. Changed
identification of top and flop performers is again limited to CE rankings.
In the right-hand panel, we conduct the same comparison for models 1 and 3. The
implications are qualitatively identical. For both top and flop performers, the cumulative
share of banks located in deciles nine and ten under the two models ranges between 74 and
98 percent. We can confirm that cost efficiency rankings are most sensitive to input price
- 30 -
specification. Approximately two percent of former role model banks are re-classified
under model 3 and the cumulative share for former trouble banks is again one percent.
In sum, the cumulative share of banks that are re-classified diametrically different as PE
top and flop performers across models is very low. But based on CE, around 1-2 percent of
former top (flop) performers are now worst (best) in class.
5.3.3 Characteristics of extreme performers
Because the use of alternative input prices affects CE especially, we limit our attention in
table 13 to top and flop performers according to cost models.

- 31 -
In the first panel, we compare relative frequencies of top and flop performers across
models and banking groups. The rightmost column depicts throughout population
representation. We find evidence that large banks are relatively often in the group of worst
performers and never a member of the top performer group according to our alternative
models. To a lesser extent, savings banks exhibit the same over- and under-representation
in the top and flop performer groups, respectively. Both alternative models amplify the
indication that especially cooperative banks are role models regarding CE.
In the second panel, we inspect the geographical representation. Only the states of Baden-
Wuerttemberg and Bavaria simultaneously host relatively many top and relatively few flop
banks, respectively. All eastern states suffer from a relative abundance of poorly
performing banks and an absence of top performers. Average cost inefficiency in the East
is thus higher even after accounting for less favourable economic conditions. Small city
states host only marginally more good banks compared to their population representation.
At the same time, they are home to too many worst performers. Potentially, a more limited
geographical scope to demand inputs restricts the cost management abilities of these banks.
Characteristics in terms of heterogeneity variables reveal that top decile banks are small.
Worst performers are larger than the average bank. These differences are amplified when
alternative input price models are used. Both groups operate in local markets with a higher
concentration than the average county in Germany. The mean HHI for top performers in
models 2 and 3, though, is almost twice as high as for banks in the top decile.
Consequently, some concentration is not per se an impediment to high CE. But beyond a
certain level, the lack of market discipline entails that managers forego cost savings. Our
measure of risk-taking, RISK, indicates that top performers choose an asset composition
close to average risk. This implies that on average the successful bank did not venture into
particularly risky business. In turn, too little risk-taking did not yield a successful strategy
in terms of CE, either. The flop decile average shows that poorly performing banks exhibit
an average risk weight around 9 percentage points below the population mean for all three
models. Finally, our proxy for the degree of active risk management, the volume of OBS,
indicates that top banks engaged less in OBS activities. The opposite holds for poor
performers. The results regarding a bank's approach to risk suggest that a passive strategy
of choosing assets close to average risk is most beneficial for banks that aim at high CE.
In the fourth panel, we compare mean KPI of the two groups. A CI I ratio that is higher for
top compared to flop performers is counterintuitive. However, it is in line with the positive
- 32 -
correlation coefficient between CI and ROE and ROA found previously. Profitability
measures ROA and ROE lead to clearer conclusions. In all three models top performers
exhibit substantially lower returns compared to both top performers and the overall mean.
The divergence between tops and flops further increases when alternative input prices are
used. Profitability KPI and CE therefore do not necessarily contradict each other when
identifying best and worst in class banks. Furthermore, alternative input prices help to
carve out best and worst in class performers in a clearer fashion.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we analyse the direction and magnitude of a measurement error inherent in
most bank efficiency studies. Despite the assumption of perfect markets and, thus,
exogenous input prices, most analyses employ bank-specific prices for labour, fixed assets
and borrowed funds when estimating cost and profit efficiency. Based on regional factor
markets, we suggest two approaches to obtain alternative input price proxies.
Our sample covers all German savings, cooperative and commercial banks between 1993
and 2003. To take the substantial degree of heterogeneity across banks into consideration,
we distinguish explicitly between deviations from optimal costs and profits due to sub-
optimal production and those caused by additional factors, such as bank sector, region of
operation, asset risk, size and local bank market conditions. Our main findings are six-fold.
First, after accounting for heterogeneity the use of alternative input price proxies affects
mean CE especially. On average, cost inefficiency is around 5 percent higher compared to
traditional input prices. In turn, PE is hardly affected. Only the group of large banks yields
improvements of PE on the order of 1.5 to 4.4 percent.
Second, our findings confirm results from the literature that in relative terms mean CE
dominates mean PE. The former is around 92 percent while the latter is around 65 percent.
However, this seemingly stark difference is put into perspective when the associated
absolute Euro amounts of foregone cost savings and profits are investigated. These are
fairly equal to each other at  25.5 billion and  22.7 billion, respectively. Therefore, the
analysis of unrealised profits and forfeited cost savings yields important insights.
Third, in terms of CE small banks operating in large western states constitute top
performers in German banking. Large banks and those located in eastern states are worst in
class, the latter exhibiting CE 15 to 18 percent below the federal average. We find that
- 33 -
larger size, more risky assets, active risk management and higher market concentration all
lead to above frontier cost. These characteristics of top and flop performers are amplified
when using alternative input prices.
Fourth, in terms of PE small banks are also among the best performing banks while their
large competitors continue to be worst in class. In contrast to CE, however, those banks
located in the East are on average more profit efficient than banks operating in the West in
general and in city states in particular.
Fifth, we confirm previous findings in the literature that both efficiency measures are only
weakly correlated with traditional KPI. We interpret this result accordingly to imply that
efficiency measures contain information complementary to accounting based indicators.
Finally, the use of alternative input prices does not only affect efficiency levels but also,
perhaps even more importantly, efficiency rankings. PE rankings are fairly stable across
models. But around 2 percent of traditionally identified CE top and flop performers are
reclassified diametrically opposed as flop and top performers, respectively, when
employing alternative input prices.
In sum, the use of alternative input prices complements and strengthens previous German
efficiency studies. Our results suggest that regional information is an important ingredient
in SFA. Explicitly accounting for heterogeneity is key for future studies. Despite doing so
we still find systematic deviations that seem to arise due to sub-optimal input use. Future
extensions may therefore follow either of the following two approaches. First, to model
input markets explicitly, estimate equilibrium prices directly and combine such results with
efficiency research. Second, to further detail the production technology of banks as to
include, for example, custody and advisory services. This would enable us to analyse if
large bank inefficiency is primarily the result of fundamentally different production
processes or whether it is simply more difficult to manage large organizations efficiently.
