Introduction
The concept of "wicked problem" is embedded with notions
of complexity. In planning and management policy, the term
wicked problem is used to refer to adverse social and envi-
ronmental situations that overwhelm existing practices and
persist even after the application of best-known practices
(Ludwig, 2001; Ritchey, 2005-2011; Rittel & Webber, 1973).
The concept is applied in organizational decision making as
a "force of fragmentation" whereby stakeholders polarize
around their views of a problem, thereby undermining col-
laborative problem solving (Conklin, 2001). From an inter-
ventionist perspective, "a do-nothing" approach is perhaps a
reasonable option for a problem that defies best intervention
practices. However, Brown, Harris, and Russell (2010)
pointed out that wicked problems will not be solved by the
same tools and processes that have created them. This sug-
gests that action is incumbent, but action must implore
mechanisms and paths different from those that have per-
petuated the problem in the first place.
In Ghana, climate change is an emerging issue in the
national discourse. Already it is known to present challenges
to current development efforts and environmental manage-
ment capacities. This article examines the nature of climate
change as a wicked problem in water resource management
in Ghana, and how social and institutional capacities influ-
ence an understanding of climate change and efforts to
address the dilemma. Using rural water management as a
reference point, this article argues that climate change as a
wicked problem in Ghana can be demonstrated in two ways:
(a) its sheer physical consequences on water resources and
(b) weaknesses in institutional capacity to adapt. But, instead
of a fatalist approach, appropriate social and ecological insti-
tutional capacities can be developed for effective adaptation.
We propose adaptive co-management (ACM) as a useful
institutional approach.
Complexity,Wicked Problems,
and Climate Change
Complexity implies degree of difficulty in defining causal
linkages of an event as well as determining the boundaries
of their effects to allow for management of them with any
meaningful degree of accuracy and confidence. Complexity is
determined by the degree of uncertainty and social disagree-
ment on a particular issue (Patton, 2011; Stacy, 1996;
Zimmerman, 2001).Aproblem at the far end of an uncertainty

Climate Change as a Wicked Problem:
An Evaluation of the Institutional Context
for Rural Water Management in Ghana
John FitzGibbon1 and Kenneth O. Mensah1
Abstract
Understanding complexity suggests that some problems are more complex than others and defy conventional solutions.
These wicked problems will not be solved by the same tools and processes that are complicit in creating them. Neither will
they be resolved by approaches short on explicating the complex interconnections of the multiple causes, consequences,
and cross-scale actors of the problem. Climate change is one such wicked problem confronting water management in Ghana
with a dilemma.The physical consequences of climate change on Ghana's water resources are progressively worsening.At the
same time, existing institutional arrangements demonstrate weak capacities to tackle climate change­related complexities in
water management.Therefore, it warrants a dynamic approach imbued with complex and adaptive systems thinking, which
also capitalizes on instrumental gains from prior existing institutions.Adaptive Co-Management offers such an opportunity
for Ghana to adapt its water management system to climate change.

and disagreement continuum is considered complex because
it challenges existing capacities to predict outcomes and
solutions, and therefore heightens disagreement resulting in
stakeholder conflicts. Complexity can be judged by source
and nature. When a problem is generated by multiple factors
from multiple sources, it is difficult to target the linkages of
the causal factors and therefore raises questions of complex-
ity to the extent that identification of the problem, and hence
its solution, becomes difficult. Complexity can also be of a
technical and social nature. The technical side relates to
limitations of quality of information and deficiency in exist-
ing knowledge systems that make diagnosis of a particular
situation problematic because of high degree of uncertainties
in the solutions offered. The social aspect focuses on inher-
ent difficulties in coordination of activities, information, and
stakeholders across disciplines, sectors, and scales in a man-
ner that minimizes conflicts and builds consensus around
solutions for a situation (Patton, 2011).
The term wicked problems was originally coined by Rittel
and Weber (1973) as the opposite of "tame problems," where
the latter can be resolved with traditional methods because it is
easy to define cause-and-effect relationship of the problem as
well as the solutions. Conversely, wicked problems are social
planning problems that defy traditional methods because they
are "ill-defined, ambiguous and associated with strong moral,
political and professional issues" (Ritchey, 2005-2011, p. 1).
They are complex, with linkages to other issues evolving in a
dynamic social context, and tackling one often leads to unin-
tended consequences of generating new sets of wicked prob-
lems. They are strongly stakeholder dependent, often with
little consensus about what the problem is, let alone how to
resolve it (Ritchey, 2005-2008, p. 1; Rittel & Weber, 1973).
Thus, complexity and wicked problems are interconnected.
Wicked problems are inherently complex in their scale of
uncertainty and disagreement, as well as in their technical and
social nature; therefore, they are best tackled by interdisciplin-
ary approaches, coexistence of different knowledge systems,
flexible governance, and participatory processes and practices
that allow for adaptive learning and ethics.
The concept of wicked problems has been applied in
complex and adaptive systems thinking to draw linkages
within social and ecological systems (SES). SES are dif-
ficult to manage both at the technical and social levels
because often they involve multiple sources, multiple
actors, and their externalities jump scales for which cross-
scale institutions are required. According to Walker et al.
(2002),
A fundamental difficulty in managing SES for long
term, sustainable outcomes is that their great complex-
ity makes it difficult to forecast the future in any
meaningful way. Not only are forecasts uncertain, the
usual statistical approaches will likely underestimate
the uncertainties. That is, even the uncertainties are
uncertain. (p. 2)
Contributing factors to uncertainty include dynamism of
the drivers of change such as human behavior, ecological fac-
tors, and scale of interaction of the processes (Dolsak et al.,
2003; Gunderson & Holling, 2002). The dynamism factor is
particularly informative for climate change adaptation because
it denotes transition of a system where internal and external
variables create constant changes in the social or ecological
domains, and a change in the critical variables of one domain
requires institutional adjustments in the other to prevent col-
lapse of the entire system (Gunderson & Holling, 2002).
It is within this context that the interconnections among
complexity, wicked problems, and climate change can be viv-
idly drawn, in that climate change adaptation requires restruc-
turing social and ecological institutions to adjust to rapid and
uncertain change as well as to take advantage of the opportuni-
ties presented by such changes (Brown et al., 2010). For
instance, Ludwig (2001) following Rittel and Weber's defini-
tion described climate change as one example of wicked prob-
lems noting, "Such problems have no definitive formulation, no
stopping rule, and no test for a solution. There will likely never
beafinalresolutionofanyofthem.Eachsuchproblemisunique:
They defy classification" (p. 3). The author identified terminolo-
gies used to describe wicked problems in the ecological litera-
ture including truly complex, complex all the way down, and
postnormal, characterized by radical uncertainty and plurality
of legitimate perspectives. Thus, climate change is intractable,
and adaptation solutions are elusive, making climate change a
perfect fit for the complexity and wicked problems model.
Indeed, current global discourses suggest that no single
phenomenon exhibits the characteristics of wicked problems
like climate change. It attracts varying interests and perspec-
tives constantly juggling for recognition and acceptance. For
instance, the Australian Public Service Commission on
Climate Change demonstrates two perspectives. First are cli-
mate change believers, but acknowledge global structural
inequalities among nations and refer rich nations to the Kyoto
Protocol to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions. Kyoto
urges that remedying climate change would require all gov-
ernments to formally agree on future emissions cuts and the
mechanisms to achieve the set targets. The onus is on devel-
oped countries to mitigate their emissions and also provide
developing countries with financial and technological assis-
tance (Ayers & Dodman, 2010; Flamos & Begg, 2010;
United Nation Framework Conventions on Climate Change
[UNFCCC], 1998). This position is frequently contested
among UNFCCC parties. The second is the skeptical per-
spective that questions the authenticity of climate change as a
human-induced problem. They argue that in a worse-case sce-
nario, the catastrophic consequences of climate change will be
moderated by technology and market forces. This could lose
traction as skepticism about climate change wanes. A third
view may be added, focusing on governance reforms with
emphasis on participation, ethics, and justice with decision
making devolved to local levels where citizens'involvement
is instrumental (Both ENDS, 2007; Brown et al., 2010).
FitzGibbon and Mensah 3
These divergent views demonstrate a high degree of dis-
agreement on the fundamental causes of and solutions for
climate change, as well as a high degree of uncertainty about
our understanding of all the variables involved in climate
change processes. In addition, it points to the deficiency in
our technical and social capabilities to be able to deal with a
phenomenon with multiple sources, actors, stakeholders,
cross-scale influences (externalities), and linkages (Australian
Public Service Commission, 2007). This leaves the policy
maker with a dynamic, plural, and argumentative system of
policy definition--typical of many wicked policy problems--
and also leaves the policy maker with a problem in which
complexity outweighs the capabilities of his or her current
repertoire of methodologies (Australian Public Service
Commission, 2007). It reechoes Hamilton's (1999) point that
"the problem of climate change is intractable by our tradi-
tional scientific methods" (quoted in Ludwig, 2001, p. 757).
The futility of relying on those same tools and practices that
have augmented the creation of the climate change problem is
being noted (Brown et al., 2010).
Current adaptation frameworks are not sophisticated
enough to sufficiently integrate the biophysical and the
sociopolitical issues across multiple scales (Brown et al.,
2010; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC],
2007; United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate
Change [UNFCCC], 2006). Yet, consensus coalesce around
the notion that effective and practical adaptive management
of climate change depends on understanding the scale of
influences of the drivers of change (general and systemic,
slow and fast) at work in the system (Pahl-Wostl, 2007;
Tschaket & Dietrich, 2010). As Wilbanks (1999) noted,
At least, it is clear that some of the driving forces oper-
ate at a global scale while many of the phenomena that
underlie environmental processes operate at a local
scale. Understanding climate change processes and
responses require attention to multiple scales and how
they relate to one another. (p. 602)
The Australian Public Service Commission is apt in its
observation that the practical challenges facing our capabilities
to address climate change are often philosophical (ideological)
and methodological, particularly as they relate to cross-scale
linkages, trust and social capital formation among institutions,
governance reforms that encourage participation, equity and
global justice, and creating spaces for social learning in an adap-
tive manner. In addition, there is consensus that effects of cli-
mate change are so advanced that mitigation alone is too late to
makeanymeaningfulreversalstothedamagealreadyinmotion,
hence the focus on adaptation (Lambrou & Piana, 2006).
Method
Our approach is diagnostic and prescriptive with a qualita-
tive analytical slant. We used primary and secondary data
sources. Primary data came from interviews with 18 key
informants from government, research, and civil society
organizations whose work intersects with water resource
management and environmental protection. Participants
responded to questions focused on the challenges of cli-
mate change in the water sector and the capacities of water
institutions to adapt. Responses were then triangulated
with secondary sources including published government,
research, and newspaper reports for reliability and validity.
For analysis, we examined the extent to which the data
matched up to Rittel and Webber's (1973) construct of
wicked problems. Based on the findings, we suggest a
method with a greater capacity to handle complexity (i.e.,
climate change).
Climate ChangeTrends in Africa
In a certain ironic fashion, Africa, the smallest contributor to
greenhouse gas emissions, is expected to be one of the most
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (Ayers &
Dodman, 2010; IPCC, 2007; Magadza, 2000; UNFCCC,
2006). Projections of multiple stresses, such as increasing
severity and frequency in water shortages, declining agricul-
tural productivity, desert and coastal encroachments, as well
as low adaptive capacity, raise concerns of security, liveli-
hoods, mass ecomigration, and development on the continent
(Brown & Crawford, 2008; Sharma et al., 1996; UNFCCC,
2006). By 2020, it is expected that more than 250 million
Africans would be exposed to increased water stress, lacking
access to portable water or adequate sanitation because of
climate change, resulting also in 50% reduction in rain-fed
agricultural yields (IPCC, 2007). This is against the backdrop
promise of universal access to safe and reliable water supply
by the UN Water Decade (1980-1990).
It is believed that climate change has affected rainfall
regimes resulting in the commonly observed frequency and
severity of floods and drought on the continent (IPCC, 2001;
Leroux, 2001). In Africa, coastal area sea-level rise is
expected to result in annual flooding and salinization of water
sources, which will severely affect millions of people in low-
lying areas (Bunce, Rosendo, & Brown, 2010; McGranahan,
Balk, & Anderson, 2007). The cost of adaptation could
amount to at least 5% to 10% of GDP (IPCC, 2007). This is a
hindrance to the realization of key millennium development
goals such as poverty reduction and ensuring environmental
sustainability (Ayers & Dodman, 2010; Both ENDS, 2007;
UNFCCC, 2006). Not surprising, IPCC (2007) identified
water security among key potential impacts of climate
change in Africa, as well as concerns of low adaptive capac-
ity on the continent. Africa's low adaptive capacity revolves
around its capital base required for capacity building and
sustainable development policy because vulnerability to cli-
mate change depends on development indicators (Ayers &
Dodman, 2010; Gyampoh, Amisah, Idinoba, & Nkem, 2009;
UNFCCC, 2006).

Climate Change as a Wicked
Problem in Water Management in
Ghana
Ghana is noted to share some notable developmental chal-
lenges with other African countries such as reliance on rain-
fed agriculture, vulnerability to drought and floods, poor
governance, and rapid population growth, which put undue
pressure on the capacity of government to provide basic infra-
structural services (Brown & Crawford, 2008). Climate change
and variability complicate these issues and undermine overall
development efforts in Ghana. As a wicked problem in the
country's water sector, climate change manifests in two dimen-
sions: first, the physical consequences of climate change on
ecological resources (including water); second, climate
change confronts existing water institutional arrangements
with a dilemma exposing weaknesses in their capacity to
tackle complexities associated with water management.
Physical Consequences
Ghana is among countries where climate change is projected
to create water stress by 2025. As far as water resources
management and use are concerned, three climate change­
related issues are relevant: extreme events brought about by
changes in rainfall and temperature regimes, variability, and
sea-level rise. As Table 1 shows, these climate change
issues, in turn, have negative repercussions on (a) the avail-
ability and quality of freshwater resources as hitherto peren-
nial water sources dry up because of severe droughts and
pollutions of water bodies due to increased floods and salt
intrusion; (b) security of human lives, property, and water
infrastructure as increased droughts, floods, and storm surges
destroy property, water supply, and hydro-generation infra-
structure, which result in the displacement of thousands,
deaths, service disruption, and social upheavals; (c) poor
health conditions and increased risk of contracting water-
related diseases; and (d) reproduction of gender inequalities
as women's reproductive work and time allocated to com-
plete the tasks increase during changing climatic conditions.
Rainfall-temperature regimes. Historical records across
Ghana suggest discernible future temperature increases and
rainfall declines. Temperature is estimated to rise on aver-
age by 0.6°C, 2.0°C, and 3.9°C by the year 2020, 2050, and
2080, respectively. Rainfall is also predicted to decrease on
average by 2.8%, 10.9%, and 18.6% by 2020, 2050, and
2080, respectively, in all agroecological zones. Upper sec-
tions of the Volta region and three northern regions suffer
drought once in every 3-year cycle (Arku, 1993). Climate
change remains an issue for the whole country, but climate
variability is a major challenge, especially for rural com-
munities that depend on natural resources and environmen-
tal services (van der Geest, 2004). For rural residents
without piped water, irregularity and extremes in weather
patterns (droughts and floods) directly affect water
availability and access, placing additional stresses on their
daily activities. As Gyampoh, Idinoba, and Amisah (2008,
p. 10) observe, "Whereas models and records of precipita-
tion mainly focus on changing amounts of precipitation with
climate change, knowledge of indigenous people also
emphasize changes in the regularity, length, intensity, and
timing of precipitation." Brown and Crawford (2008)
observe that climate variability in combination with popula-
tion growth will compound the adverse effects of inadequate
water supply in the country, particularly in the dry North, and
could lead to a 12-fold increase in the demand for irrigation
by 2050. The major dams that have been the mainstay of
urban water supply fluctuate in similar fashion to rivers,
ponds, and creeks, which serve rural communities in corre-
spondence to climate variability (Gyampoh et al., 2009).
The crisis could get worse, especially for rural water sys-
tems, if effective adaptation mechanisms are not found soon
(Environment Protection Agency [EPA], 2000; Ferguson &
Rankin, 2005).
Sea-level rise and coastal challenges. Climate change com-
pounds the adverse effects of inadequate water supply in
inland communities. Yet, sea-level change from that in 1990
indicates an average rise of 5.8, 16.5, and 34.5 cm by 2020,
2050, and 2080. An estimated sea-level rise of 1 m by 2100
could inundate 1,120 km2 of lands and put 132,000 at risk
(EPA, 2000). It will worsen salt water intrusion into estuaries
and aquifers, raised coastal water tables, and exacerbate
coastal flooding and storm damage to coastal properties
(EPA, 2000; Dankelman et al., 2008; Douglas et al., 2008).
This will put two thirds of lands and residents living within
the East Coast at risk. It will cost an estimated US$1.14 bil-
lion to protect all shorelines at risk with populations greater
than 10 persons/km2 with seawalls and US$590 million to
protect only the "important areas" (EPA, 2000).
Gender, water, and climate change adaptation. Women have
low adaptive capacities arising from ascribed social and eco-
nomic inequities inherent in traditional and nontraditional
structures that manifest in distinct differences of unequal
access to property rights, information, education, unemploy-
ment, and resources between men and women (Mensah-
Kutin, 2008). Changing climatic conditions (e.g., droughts)
aggravate these gender relations by increasing women's
reproductive work and time allocated to complete water-
related tasks (Arku & Arku, 2010; Awumbila & Momsen,
1995). The result is that in comparison with men, most
women are less represented in productive activities, are
poorer, and participate less in the governance of natural
resources, including water (Gyimah & Thompson, 2008;
Mensah-Kutin, 2008). Thus, climate change will exacerbate
the woes of women and poor people because their liveli-
hoods depend on natural resources and economic sectors that
are susceptible to climate change. In this regard, Ghana's cli-
mate change policy is criticized for taking a gender-neutral
position, thereby worsening the vulnerability of these groups
(Mensah-Kutin, 2008; Tutuah-Mensah, 2009).

Security concerns. Brown and Crawford (2008) identified
climate change­related security challenges that Ghana will
face, including managing the north­south divide of water
supply, allocating water between energy in the south and agri-
culture in the north, management of regional water sources,
and border issues. However, the authors maintain that climate
change is just one of the interrelated development issues that
Ghana faces and that, except in extreme scenarios, the effects
of climate change may only act as a catalyst to exacerbate a
number of existing problems. Worsening negative impacts of
frequent floods and drought life and property, and on expen-
sive infrastructures for domestic water supply, irrigation, and

is a direct security threat. Furthermore, as far as water supply
is concerned, there is little doubt that the impact of climate
change and variability is both a direct and determining factor
in access to potable water. Therefore, social and institutional
reforms are needed to address the recalcitrant and complex
issues associated with climate change and related water
problems.
Social and Institutional Reforms in Ghana
It is axiomatic among risk management practitioners that
resource availability and institutional capacities are key
determinants of the ease with which climate change­related
risks and vulnerabilities deteriorate into full-blown disaster.
In this regard, Ghana has undertaken several reform policies
to build its social and institutional capacities, resulting in an
elaborate political decentralization and water governance
structure (Figure 1). Since 1988, Ghana established political
and administrative institutions at three levels: district, subdis-
trict, and community. In addition, it has privatized its water
sector and established management, facilitation, and regula-
tion agencies such as the Water Resources Commission
(WRC), Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA),
Ghana Water Company, among other stakeholder agencies. In
particular, CWSA was established in 1998 with the mandate to
facilitate water and sanitation facilities delivery and hygiene
education to rural communities (Odame-Ababio, 2003).
CWSA fosters partnerships with foreign and local public,
private, and civil society organizations to streamline their
activities in the rural water sector. Current rural water supply
coverage by CWSA stands at 63%. The activities of CWSA
are supposed to end at the regional level. Responsibility for
water supply and capacity building at the district level rests
with the District Assembly, which must liaise with subdistrict
entities such as Unit Committees, local water and sanitation
teams, and related stakeholders. Thus, Ghana's water sector,
especially rural water supply, demonstrates a mosaic of inter-
linked institutions from international through local-level
interspersed with private, nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs), and civil organizations (Mensah, 1998; Schiffer,
McCarthy, Birner, Waale, & Asante, 2008).
On climate change, Ghana is active at the international
level as a party to the UNFCCC and signatory to the Kyoto
Protocol. Internally, mainstreaming climate change into exist-
ing decentralized system and development policies, such as
the Ghana Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy and mil-
lennium development goals, are seen as the surest way to
effectively cope (United Nations Development Programme,
2008; Tutuah-Mensah, 2009). The creation of the EPA with
the mandate for environmental sustainability is acknowl-
edged as a notable climate change effort. Other responsibili-
ties of EPA include research and development, rule making,
standard settings, and enforcement. In addition, it collabo-
rates with other stakeholders to ensure sustainable water
resource management (Laube, 2007; Mensah, 1998).
Despite all these initiatives, climate change represents a
perplexing phenomenon for Ghana's water management
institutions. First, climate change is a relatively new area in
the national discourse and policy making, which suggests that
the institutional memory, knowledge base, and institutional
collaboration required for effective adaptation actions are
not only underdeveloped but also not fully understood. In
addition, climate change was originally not envisaged in the
mandates of major water institutions such as the WRC and
CWSA. As such the CWSA has continued to carry out its
activities without recourse to climate change, whereas the
WRC is only recently making strides with the Climate
Change Adaptation Project to make the connections between
water resources management and climate change (WRC,
2010). In addition, the nature and scale of the major causes,
important stakeholders, and regimes in climate change reso-
lutions operate beyond the national scale, thereby limiting
the ability of national institutional actors to adapt. Finally,
linkages between some national institutions, such as CWSA
and EPA, and international donors and NGOs provide oppor-
tunities to access valuable resources to undertake water and/
or adaptation projects. However, overdependence on foreign
donors to undertake such a crucial national project raises
questions of sustainability and security in the water sector.
For instance, more than 70% of CWSA operating budget
comes from foreign donors.
Table 2 provides a comparative analysis of Ritter and
Weber's (1973) characteristics of wicked problems and the
extent of their manifestation in climate change vis-à-vis
water management in Ghana. It explicates the complex rela-
tionship between climate change and water resource man-
agement in Ghana because of multiplicity of causal factors,
actors and views involved, as well as scale concerns.
Institutional reforms (i.e., decentralization and water gover-
nance) have the potential to improve our understanding of
the relationships between water supply and impacts of cli-
mate change. However, the current practices exhibit low
adaptive capacities, which result from weak collaborative
linkages among institutions, and do not foster the requisite
learning to enable rural communities to effectively respond
and adapt their water resources to climate change (Mensah,
2012). Ghana, therefore, needs an approach that can reason-
ably respond to climate change and related complexities in
water management.
Responding to Complexity
and Uncertainty,That Is,
Wicked Problems
Stacy (1996) provided a useful model for responding to
complexity, that is, wicked problems (Figure 2). The zone of
complexity is between the region of chaos (Zone 4) and the
regions amenable to traditional management approaches
(Zones 1, 2, and 3). The complexity zone requires ingenuity

Table 2. Properties of Wicked Problems
Rittel and Weber CC and water supply in Ghana
There is no definitive formulation of a
wicked problem
i.
Disparate knowledge and opinions on whether observed changing weather
patterns are CC related or constitutive of the natural cycle, for example,
significant knowledge exist in formal institutions (government agencies, NGOs,
and research institutes) and educated urban residents about drivers of CC. Most
laymen and rural residents are ignorant of drivers of CC or perceive it as an act
of God (Gyampoh,Amisah, Idinoba, & Nkem, 2009; Mensah, 2012)
ii. 
As a result of different experiences, perceptions and political interests of these
multiple publics, water supply policies, institutions, and infrastructure to adapt to
CC seem to be aiming at a moving target
Wicked problems have no stopping
rule
i.
CC and its impacts are progressively getting worse while uncertainty remains
about how long it will linger on, for example, past climate records, and future
predictions point to progressive deterioration with continuous scarcity and
poor quality of freshwater resources
ii.
Majority of CC programs are donor funded. It is doubtful whether Ghana can
self-generate satisfactory criteria and be able to sustain its adaptive capacities
over a long uncertain period especially beyond the cycle of donor funding
iii.
Dire implications for rural communities because their adaptation capacity is
threatened by a combination of poverty, disregard for traditional norms, poor
education and knowledge flow, and dependence on charity, mainly NGOs
Solutions to wicked problems are not
true or false but good or bad
Although the EPA,WRC, CWSA, among other public agencies, are mandated by
law, their ability to determine the correctness of any water adaptation decision to
implement against CC rarely gets past critical scrutiny or challenge by numerous
stakeholder agencies such as NGOs involved in the environment and water sector
There is no immediate and no
ultimate test of a solution to a
wicked problem
Because the major drivers of CC operate at the global scale, it is impossible
for national and local actors to determine when desired results of a proposed
intervention to adapt water systems to CC has been achieved, especially
taking into account the inability of any system to fully appraise all unintended
consequences prior to or post intervention
Every solution to a wicked problem
is a "one-shot operation" because
there is no opportunity to learn by
trial and error; every attempt counts
significantly
CC-related droughts and floods create water shortages through drying up of local
streams and perennial rivers and disrupting water quality. Conventional solutions
have resorted to massive dam projects such as Akosombo, Kpong, Densu, and so
on. However, these projects have brought irreversible hardships to communities
that depend on these rivers for their livelihoods and water needs
Wicked problems do not have
an enumerable (or exhaustively
describable) set of potential
solutions, and there is no well-
described set of permissible
operations that may be incorporated
into the plan
CC­related water supply resolutions are politically shaped by varying experiences,
ideologies, and power of stakeholders from international to local levels. Ghana
has no agreement criteria for judging successfully completed water adaptation
programs against CC; whether to base judgment on international agencies
and government list of funded programs or on dominant agreement among all
stakeholders is uncertain
Every wicked problem is essentially
unique
By scale and intensity, CC is one of a kind, nothing close to known experiences
of extreme environmental events (e.g., droughts or floods) related to water
resources in Ghana.Therefore, it makes insufficient or inappropriate adaptive
capacities crafted out of knowledge gained from traditional and formal institutional
arrangements over the years because of the lack of understanding of the inherent
complexities related to multiple causes and scale, and constant trajectory changes.
The situation is exacerbated by disjointed collaboration among stakeholder
institutions
Every wicked problem can be
considered to be a symptom of
another problem
The impacts of CC on water resources and supply reflect growing concerns about
their interconnections with other intractable national and global problems, for
example, an unjust global geopolitics, deteriorating social and ecological systems,
poverty, misfit/incapable institutions and resource governance system, gender
inequalities, and so on.Therefore, exclusive action on CC without attention
to related problems will be ineffective. But Ghana lacks the ability to influence
global action in any significant way.As such it can only adopt an incremental
strategy within the country and regionally as in WRC's adopted comanagement of
international rivers and major internal watersheds

in innovation and a shift from past practices to create new
modes of operating because the predictive power of tradi-
tional management approaches becomes ineffective here
(Zimmerman, 2001). In elaborating on the model, the authors
provide a typology for responding to different levels of
dilemma and complex scenarios, requiring changing
approaches in moving from agreement and certainty. Within
this framework, specific tools or mechanisms can be applied
to respond to complex issues, including Mess Mapping and
Resolution Mapping Processes (see Horn & Weber, 2007),
General Morphological Analysis (Ritchey, 2005-2011), and
ACM. This article focuses on ACM, not on the other two.
ACM seeks to legitimize decision making in complex
situations through effective collaboration, flexible gover-
nance, and continuous learning informed by experience.
Three phases of Stacy­Zimmerman's model arranged back-
ward (Table 3) fits the ACM idea of water management
under complexity, although the first phase is a necessary
condition for responding to severe consequences on water
resources under changing climatic conditions as the
Ghanaian scenario demonstrates. ACM may be useful for
Ghana because it is a dynamic approach imbued with com-
plex and adaptive systems thinking with internal capacity to
minimize ineffectiveness and inefficiencies in existing
social and institutional models, while capitalizing on oppor-
tunities of instrumental gains from prior existing institu-
tions. Particularly, ACM will help strengthen the capacities
of rural water management systems to adapt to climate
change because of its emphasis on equity and power bal-
ance through stakeholder deliberative processes, strength-
ening horizontal and cross-scale linkages, and creating
space for iterative learning and opportunities for coexis-
tence and interaction among different knowledge systems,
thereby giving legitimacy to decisions and actions.
ACM
ACM is a successor to earlier approaches (resilience, adap-
tive, and later comanagement) that emphasized social and
ecological dynamism, network governance, resilience, and
capacity building process through learning from experiences
(Berkes, 2009). ACM emerged in the late 1970s against the
backdrop of failures in community-based sustainable
Rittel and Weber CC and water supply in Ghana
The existence of a discrepancy
representing a wicked problem can
be explained in numerous ways.The
choice of explanation determines the
nature of the problem's resolution
No meaningful locally designed water adaptation interventions against CC.
Agencies such as EPA,WRC, and NGOs all seem to tailor their strategies toward
internationally driven initiatives such as MDGs and so on.This is justified as being
part of the international community or determination to secure funding sources.
Traditional authority and informal knowledge are often sidelined by experts from
state and formal agencies
The planner has no right to be
wrong (Planners are liable for the
consequences of the actions they
generate)
The precautionary principle is implied here, a key element of Ghana Water Policy.
However, current Ghanaian practice places no liability on planners and policy
makers for unintended mistakes after due diligence, probably justifiably so because
learning from experience and even mistakes (adaptive) is fundamental to building
capacities against latent uncertainties of CC. Nonetheless, the principle compels
planners and implementers in CC and water resources to ponder their actions
carefully to minimize negative externalities of their actions on others

development that painted images of consensual communities
and stable environments (Leach, Mearns, & Scoones, 1997).
It is an integration of adaptive management and comanage-
ment (Armitage, Berkes, & Doubleday, 2007; Berkes, 2007;
Plummer & FitzGibbon, 2007). Consequently, it combines
iterative learning in adaptive management with the central
element of linkages in collaborative management where rights
and responsibilities are jointly shared (Berkes, 2007; Dolsak
et al., 2003). Scalar issues are important to ACM as it draws
the linkages between stakeholder networks and access to
political, technical, social, and economic resources (adaptive
capacities) of local communities and households. The local
scale is viewed as the place where "issues of management
performance are felt most directly" but emphasize "a flexible
system for environment and resource management that oper-
ates across multiple levels and with a range of local and non-
local organizations and actors" (Armitage et al., 2007, p. 5).
There is no single all-encompassing definition of ACM.
However, learning by doing, integrating multiple knowledge
systems, emphasizing flexibility of management structures,
and advancing collaboration through power sharing at mul-
tiple scales remain central (Plummer & FitzGibbon, 2007).
Climate change adaptation involves SES and therefore
fits the complexity or adaptive systems framework. The tran-
sitional nature of global climate system implies that adaptation
is not geared toward a predictable end state. Rather, it is about
a newly configured system, which is just one of potential mul-
tiple end states (Gunderson & Holling, 2002; Walker et al.,
2002). This suggests an element of path dependence or contin-
gency in the possible outcomes of the adaptive approach. As
such "we must focus on learning to live within systems,
rather than `controlling' them" (Walker et al., 2002, p. 2).
This is the basis of Gunderson and Holling's (2002) "panachy"
concept (a hierarchy of nested adaptive cycles across time
and space). It is also the basis of their indictment against
"development experts": (a) ignorance of the key drivers of
change in a dynamic system, and the distinctly different scales
of time and space they operate therefore exposing conventional
ecological management practices to self-destructive-
controlled ecological interventions along with the sociocul-
tural structures that support it and (b) ignorance of the con-
nectedness and linkages in ecology and society, as well as
knowledge systems. Armitage et al. (2007) concluded,
Complex systems thinking offers a way of examining,
describing, interpreting, and cognitively structuring not
only ecological systems but also increasingly linked
socio-ecological systems. Specifically, complex systems
thinking highlights the dynamic, nonlinear relationships
among coupled social and ecological phenomena that
result in discontinuities, surprises, system flips, and the
potential for multiple equilibrium states. (p. 7)
What Should ACM for Ghana Look Like?
The underpinning tenets of ACM are informative for Ghana
because climate change is a young and understudied sub-
ject in the country. Therefore, the full extent of intricate
interconnections of climate change with other sectors and
ecological resources (including water), and associated

impacts on their vulnerabilities are not well understood.
Ghana's environmental and water agencies should work
with the assumption that climate change is exacerbating
water vulnerabilities and pushing water resources manage-
ment capacities to their tether. The major task is to encourage
formal research and traditional learning institutions to iden-
tify emerging patterns and their levels of operation and a
disaggregated impact assessment on people (Table 3, Phase
1). It is especially relevant for rural water supply because
rural communities in Ghana lag behind in most capitals and
hence their low adaptive capacities.
A typical ACM for Ghana must specifically emphasize
continuous learning in an iterative manner within networks
and continuous information sharing and education as its over-
riding objective for local management institutions (Pahl-
Wostl, 2007; Tschakert & Dietrich, 2010). The effects of
climate change will linger for a while. Therefore, institutional
strategies that have proved capable of coping with extreme
climatic events must be identified and incorporated into
regional and national adaptation plans until more adaptable
ones are found. In addition, formal education must incorpo-
rate lessons on mitigation and adaptation because today's stu-
dents are future policy makers. Extension workers must be
informed and motivated to educate local people but must be
willing to be receptive to local wisdom and practices. Cultural
and religious groups must be targeted for education because
people with formal education and nontraditional beliefs tend
to flout traditional ecological norms that have been the main-
stay of rural water management (Appiah-Opoku & Hyma,
1999; Gyampoh et al., 2009; Sarfo-Mensah & Oduro, 2007).
Local communication systems (e.g., community radios) must
use local dialect to reach their communities to be abreast with
new and tested ideas as well as improve their technical capaci-
ties. In this regard, Ada Community Radio is worth mention-
ing in the way it interacts with and helps educate and mobilize
local people about environment and climate change issues in
the Dangme East District (Larweh, 2006; Mensah, 2012).
This approach has proved useful not only in bonding but also
in bridging cross-scale linkages among nations (Pahl-Wostl,
2007;Stringeretal.,2006).NGOs,CivilSocietyOrganizations
(CSOs), and international aid agencies must be given easy
access to institutional information and local communities to
help in capacity building.
In addition, emphasis should be placed on institutional
bricolage, with recognition of informal knowledge as a legit-
imate source of information for climate and water manage-
ment issues because they have been useful for generations in
helping local communities adjust to environmental distur-
bances. This will require codification of some sort to pre-
serve them for future generations similar to the Peoples
Biodiversity Register in India (Gadgil, Seshagiri Rao,
Utkarsh, Pramod, & Chatre, 2000) or perhaps mainstream
them into national adaptation plans. For instance, Tengo and
Belfrage (2004) found examples of how old practices served
as a source of adaptation for dealing with new conditions,
and that new knowledge was adjusted to local conditions in
both Sweden and Tanzania.
We must acknowledge the importance of ethics and
social justice in environmental problems. They cannot
be resolved without the participation of those most
affected. In fact, a satisfactory resolution may well
hinge on special sorts of local knowledge and institu-
tions that will only become available if local people are
welcomed as active and influential participants.
Perhaps, if room is made for them at the table, a new
science that incorporates traditional knowledge and
values will emerge. (Berkes & Folke, 1998, quoted in
Ludwig, 2001, p. 763)
Conflicts over control of resources and decision-making
authority have been observed between decentralized bodies
and traditional authorities and also between local decentral-
ized units and community water organizations (Anani, 1999;
Jackson & Gariba, 2002). Such conflicts must be addressed
swiftly, and the boundaries of authority of these institutions
must be addressed clearly and responsibly. This will require
collaboration at all levels where trust and respect are pursued
(building social capital). This framework will focus on bring-
ing in vulnerable groups--poor and women--by deliberately
targeting them and creating space for them to participate in
decision making. It will require different negotiation skills
among facilitators, policy makers, and implementers to
bridge the gap between local authorities and government
institutions over control of water resources. Within this con-
text, blanket cash-and-carry approaches for accessing water
will be reevaluated based on specific community context
allowing each community to come up with an arrangement
suitable to its needs. This will minimize conflict endemic in
the current arrangement. Finally, climate and water policies
must be linked with broad social and economic activities of
rural people. As Brown and Crawford (2008) suggested,
Ghana needs holistic adaptation measures that address the
full range of development problems it faces that are tangen-
tially related to climate change, not just those that arise as a
result of climate change. Collectively, these will help over-
come the observation that because climate change transcend
the local scale the tools to equip adaptive learning in Africa
are sparse, as a result of communication deficiencies which
make it difficult to integrate science information into climate
policy and practice; and lack of learning tools that encourage
adaptation process, including experimentation and innovation
in building resilience in complex high risk socio-ecological
systems (Tschakert & Dietrich, 2010).
Conclusion
While the preceding discussion indicates that climate change
is a wicked problem defying easy solutions, the vulnerability
of people is a matter of degree based on specific contexts.
12 SAGE Open
Some nations, regions, groups, and individuals are better able
to ameliorate their exposures to climate change, whereas in
others vulnerability can easily deteriorate into disasters.
Therefore, the key issue to tackling climate change hinges on
adaptive capacities based on abilities derived from availabil-
ity and access to capitals that empower communities and
individuals to act appropriately. In the case of Ghana, climate
change involves a level of complexity that goes beyond the
capacity of national and local water institutions to meaning-
fully manage. The enormity has arisen from, among other
things, scalar dimensions of climate, diversity of climate, and
water-related functions, and the multitude of linkages that
these functions have with peoples' livelihoods. The WRC,
CWSA, Ministries, and agencies responsible for environ-
mental services seem to be doing alright at the international
and national levels. But the linkages at the subnational and
local levels are weak. The way forward is to maintain flexible
collaborative management systems that foster participation in
decision making, social capital formation, and coexistence of
formal and informal knowledge systems with the ultimate
intent of engendering social learning in an adaptive manner.
Whether global forces are understood or not, or action is
taken by global powers to address climate change or not,
local people cannot stop carrying on with their lives. They
will do what is within their power to ensure that their liveli-
hoods and communities are not violently disrupted. Local
methods might be different, even insufficient, but not to be
frowned upon because that would amount to throwing away
the babe together with the bath water, denying local people
the opportunity to participate in their development process.
Rather, the Ghana government through its designated water
and environmental institutions must empower rural commu-
nities by strengthening their capacities to take charge of their
own destinies as they have done for generations. In pursu-
ance of this objective, ACM is a reasonable management
approach for Ghana because it focuses on sustainable devel-
opment based on ecologically conscious, inclusive, and net-
work governance principles making it attractive in managing
complex situations such as climate change.
