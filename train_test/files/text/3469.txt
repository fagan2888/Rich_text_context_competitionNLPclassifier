Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the ability of synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
or osteoarthritis (OA) to modulate cell-surface phenotype, function and viability of monocytes.
Methods: Monocytes from healthy donors were incubated with synovial fluid from patients with
RA or OA. These were then cultured with autologous healthy CD4þ T-cells. Immunoglobulin-like
transcript 4 (ILT4) and CD86 were evaluated on stimulated monocytes and CD4þ T-cells via
fluorescence activated cell sorting.
Results: Monocytes incubated with synovial fluid from patients with RA (SF-RA; n ¼ 12) had
significantly lower ILT4 and higher CD86 levels than those incubated with synovial fluid from
patients with OA (SF-OA; n ¼ 12) or medium alone. In patients with RA, there was a significant
negative correlation between ILT4 and disease activity score (DAS; r ¼ À0.699), and a positive
correlation between CD86 and DAS (r ¼ 0.626). T-cells costimulated with monocytes cultured
with SF-RA produced significantly more interferon-g and tumour necrosis factor-a than those
costimulated with monocytes cultured with SF-OA or controls.
Conclusions: Soluble mediators in SF-RA could contribute to modulating inflammation and local
effectiveness of the immune response.

Introduction
Monocytes and macrophages represent the
major immune cells in synovial tissues and
are responsible for the chronic inflammation
and joint destruction evident in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). Hallmarks of local path-
ology are infiltration of neutrophils,
lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as
the expansion of resident fibroblasts in the
synovium. The majority of immune cells
within synovial tissues are macrophages;
these are recruited profusely in RA and
contribute to joint destruction.1,2 Several
proteins involved in inflammatory pathways
and the immune response have been identi-
fied in the synovial fluid of patients with RA
(SF-RA).3
The aim of the present study was to
investigate the ability of SF-RA to modulate
cell-surface phenotype, function and viabil-
ity of monocytes in RA. We evaluated the
presence of immunoglobulin-like transcript
4 (ILT4; a receptor crucial to monocyte
tolerogenic function) and CD86 (a regulator
of T-cell activation).
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited patients aged !18 years
with active knee RA, and age- and sex-
matched patients with knee osteoarthritis
(OA), attending the Rheumatology Unit of
the University of Rome ``Tor Vergata'',
Rome, Italy, between February 2013 and
February 2014. Exclusion criteria for
patients with RA were local intra-articular
corticosteroid injection within 5 weeks
before synovial fluid: aspiration and treat-
ment with biological agents. Clinical data
were collected retrospectively from patient
charts and included disease duration,
C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid
factor (RF) and anticyclic citrullinated
peptide antibody (ACPA) levels, disease
activity score (DAS) 44,4 and treatment.
The study was carried out in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and
International Conference on Harmonisation
Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The ethics
committee of the University of Rome ``Tor
Vergata'' approved the study, and all patients
provided written informed consent prior to
enrolment.
Synovial fluid collection
Synovial fluid was collected via joint aspir-
ation in association with therapeutic arthro-
centesis. Approximately 2­4 ml of synovial
fluid was collected in sodium heparin-coated
VacutainerTM tubes (Becton, Dickinson and
Co., East Rutherford, NJ, USA); samples
contaminated with blood were discarded.
Immediately after collection, samples were
centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4C, and
the resulting supernatants were aliquotted
and stored at À20C.
Monocyte culture
Whole venous blood samples from the
antecubital vein were collected from healthy
volunteers using standard methods; periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
isolated using HistopaqueÕ1077 (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. PBMCs were washed
twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.4) and centrifuged at 130 g for 15 min at
4C to remove platelets. Cells were

suspended in culture medium (RPMI-1640;
ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) containing 10% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum (FCS), and further enriched
for monocytes via elutriation, as described
previously.5
Elutriated monocytes were plated at
5 Â 105 cells/well in 200 ml in 96-well V-
bottom plates (Corning Incorporated,
Corning, NY, USA), in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 20% FCS,
2 mM L-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin,
50 mg/ml streptomycin (complete medium)
and cultured at 37C in a humidified atmos-
phere of 5% carbon dioxide in air for 72 h, in
the presence or absence of 20 ml synovial
fluid (from each study subject) and/or
10 mg/ml adalimumab (HumiraÕ, AbbVie,
Chicago, IL, USA).
FACS
Monocytes were washed once with washing
buffer (3% (v/v) FCS and 0.1% (w/v)
sodium azide in PBS (pH 7.4), then incu-
bated with R-phycoerythrin-cyanine (PC5)-
conjugated anti-CD14 (Immunotech,
Marseille, France), phycoerythrin-conju-
gated anti-ILT4 (Immunotech), or fluores-
cein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
anti-CD86 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) (each 1 : 10 dilution), for 30 min at
4C in the dark. The negative range and
staining specificity for each cell-surface
marker was established using a correspond-
ing isotype-matched control antibody,
conjugated with the same fluorescent dye.
Flow cytometry was performed using a
FACScanTM flow cytometer and analysed
with CellQuestTM software (both from
Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA). For each analysis, 104 events were
gated on CD14 expression and a light-
scatter gate, designed to either include only
viable cells (surface markers determination)
or exclude cellular debris (determination of
intracellular cytokine production).
The ability of synovial fluid to modulate
the costimulatory effect of monocytes was
evaluated as follows. PBMC from a single
donor were used to generate (i) purified
monocytes via elutriation, and (ii) purified
CD4þ T cells using a T cell-negative isola-
tion kit (DynalÕ; ThermoFisher Scientific).
Monocytes were used just after elutriation
and CD4þ T cells were frozen just after
purification. Monocytes were incubated for
72 h in the presence or absence of synovial
fluid from each participant, harvested,
washed, plated at 2 Â 105/ml in a flat-
bottom 96-well plate coated with anti-CD3
antibody (10 mg/ml; Beckton Dickinson),
then mixed 1 : 1 with thawed autologous
CD4þ T cells in the presence of 1 mg/ml
brefeldin A (Sigma) and incubated for 18 h
at 37C in the dark. At the end of the
incubation period, cells were washed with
washing buffer (formulated as a neutral
pH,7.4)] and incubated with 1 : 10
PC5-conjugated anti-CD3 (Immunotech)
for 30 min at 4C in the dark. Cells were
permeabilized in BD Cytofix/CytopermTM
(Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA), stained
with 1 : 10 FITC-conjugated anti-interferon
(IFN)-g (R&D Systems, San Diego, CA,
USA) for 30 min at room temperature. The
negative range and staining specificity for
each cell-surface marker and cytokine was
established using a corresponding isotype-
matched control antibody, conjugated with
the same fluorescent dye.
Cell viability and apoptosis
Elutriated monocytes were cultured in the
presence or absence of synovial fluid or
serum from each patient with RA. At the
end of the incubation period, cells were
washed twice in PBS (pH 7.4), detached by
gentle scraping, and collected by low-speed
centrifugation (100 g, 4C, for 30 min). The
centrifuged cell pellet was gently resus-
pended in 1.5 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome
solution containing propidium iodide, as
Chimenti et al. 17
described previously.6 Propidium iodide
fluorescence of individual nuclei was mea-
sured by FACS as described previously.7
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD, median
(interquartile range) or n (%). Normality of
distribution was assessed using
Kolmogorov­Smirnov goodness-of-fit test.
Between-variable comparisons were made
using Student's t-test or Mann­Whitney
U-test. Correlations were evaluated via
Pearson's parametric test for univariate
analysis. P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All statistical ana-
lyses were performed using SPSSÕ version
10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ.
Results
The study included 12 patients with RA
(four male/eight female; mean age
56.3 Æ 14.2 years; age range 38­71 years),
and 12 patients with OA (five male/seven
female; mean age 60.5 Æ 16.5 years; age
range 48­77 years). Demographic and clin-
ical data from the two patient groups are
shown in Table 1. There were no statistically
significant between-group differences in age,
sex or disease duration. Serum concentra-
tions of CRP, RF and ACPA were signifi-
cantly higher in the RA group than the OA
group (P < 0.001 for each comparison).
Significantly more patients with RA were
taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids and dis-
ease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
(DMARDs) than those with OA (P < 0.001
for each comparison).
Cell-surface levels of ILT4 were signifi-
cantly lower in monocytes cultured with
SF-RA than in control cells cultured in
medium alone (P ¼ 0.0023; Figure 1a).
In contrast, cell-surface levels of CD86
were increased in monocytes cultured with
SF-RA compared with control cells

(P ¼ 0.0001; Figure 1b). There was a signifi-
cant negative correlation between DAS and
ILT4 levels (r¼ À0.699; P¼ 0.11; Figure 1c),
and a significant positive correlation
between DAS and CD86 levels (r ¼ 0.626,
P ¼ 0.03; Figure 1d). There were no correl-
ations between ILT4 or CD86 and CRP, RF
or ACPA levels, duration of disease and
medications (data not shown).
Costimulation of CD4þ T cells with
monocytes incubated with SF-RA resulted
in significantly higher IFN-g and TNF-a
production than observed in CD4þ T cells
costimulated with monocytes incubated
with SF-OA, or control monocytes
(P< 0.001 for both comparisons; Figure 1e).
SF-RA had no effect on IFN-g production
by normal lymphocytes stimulated with
anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and
anti-CD28 mAb (Figure 1e). As shown in
Figure 1f, SF-RA significantly reduced the
percentage of hypodiploid DNA compared
with SF-OA or FCS. The addition of
adalimumab significantly increased the
amount of hypodiploid DNA formation
compared with monocytes incubated with
SF-RA.
Discussion
We have demonstrated that monocytes
incubated with SF-RA acquire a nontolero-
genic/activated surface phenotype, charac-
terized by reduced levels of ILT4 and
increased levels of CD86.8 These changes
in monocyte surface phenotype induced by
SF-RA were associated with an increased
ability to costimulate autologous CD4þ T
cells, and increased proinflammatory cyto-
kine production. Finally, we provided evi-
dence that SF-RA reduces the rate of
spontaneous apoptosis of monocytes that
is reversed by the addition of adalimumab.
ILT4 has been shown to exert a negative
influence on the stimulatory capacity of
antigen presenting cells,9 exerting either a
direct influence on innate effectors or an
indirect effect on the adaptive response and
possibly playing a pathogenic role in RA.10
Indeed, changes in the relative balance of
activating and inhibitory ILTs in the syno-
vium could lead to inappropriate activity of
innate immune agents that may then drive
T-cell activation.11 Our findings suggest that
soluble mediators in SF-RA could be con-
tributing factors in modulating the local
effectiveness of the immune response and
inflammation.
