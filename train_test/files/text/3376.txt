Formulation of a Success Model in
Pharmaceutical R&D: Efficient Innovation
Model
Hyunju Rachel Kim1
Abstract
Recently, pharmaceutical R&D has been demanded to increase productivity in terms of time efficiency and innovation as
well. There have been discontinuous challenges coming up in this industry, such as globalized R&D competition, stricter
regulation, lengthy process of clinical trials, and so on. Considering external changes, high competition, and discontinuities
in the industry, it is a good time to redefine the concept of success in pharmaceutical R&D. Thus, this article attempts to
formulate a new success model in pharmaceutical R&D, through contextualizing the industry's success factors.

Introduction
The pharmaceutical industry faces many challenges
including low productivity (Enyinda, 2008; Hirschler,
2011), declining approval rates from the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) (Hirschler, 2011), and R&D over-
expenditures (DiMasi, Hansen, & Grabowski, 2003;
Scherer, 2011). There were debates on how to analyze the
R&D expenditures or what is its impact on policy makers in
Congress (DiMasi, Hansen, & Grabowski, 2008; Light,
2008; Light & Warburton, 2005).
This article takes a new approach to these issues. This
article proposes a best managerial model as a solution to
R&D managers who need to generate innovative treatments
and get FDA approvals. Now more than ever, R&D
managers need a new managerial model for overcoming
challenges that often result in managerial defeats and lay-
offs. Focusing on improving success and efficient innovation
is the best way to overcome these industry issues.
This article formulates "Efficient Innovation Model
(EIM)" which redefines the concept of success in
pharmaceutical industry. According to the model, firms' R&D
strategies and R&D managerial capabilities comprise the key
constructs that bring about efficient innovation. Outsourcing,
collaboration, and offshoring R&D strategies are understood
as significant ways toward efficient innovation. R&D
managerial capabilities are defined by managerial openness
and strategic cognition; managerial openness consists of the
openness to new technology, openness to networking, and
openness to information sharing.
In addition to suggesting the EIM, this article builds
edifice of optimal managerial capabilities by identifying the
constructs of optimal managerial capabilities and examining
them in relationship with R&D strategies in the context of
industrial logic. It appears that managerial capabilities play
a significant role in constituting EIM in identifying
industrial logic, conducting R&D strategies, and achieving
innovation in a most efficient way. For instance, EIM in
pharmaceuticals is seamlessly sealed by this article's
constructs of managerial capabilities.
EIM diverges from conventional Ansoff's Success
Hypothesis. Ansoff broadly hypothesized the relationships
among triplet--industrial turbulence level, strategies, and
matching managerial capabilities (Ansoff, 1987a, 1987b;
Ansoff & McDonnell, 1990). Industrial turbulence levels
were quantified by the degree and speed of change and
discontinuity. However, this view lacks in a definition and
constructs of managerial capabilities as well as strategies in
the context of success. The EIM connects managerial
capabilities with their strategies to create success.
This article contributes to managerial capabilities
literature by highlighting that managers are ultimately
responsible for identifying industrial success models and
success factors, conducting strategies, and gaining
innovation. It builds managerial capabilities constructs
through contextualizing industrial logic and strategies; it
further specifies constructs and solidifies their interplay.
This approach is more specific at reflecting management
than dynamic capabilities (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997).
Dynamic capabilities are illustrated as the managerial
capabilities that are able to utilize internal and external
resources in changing ways: networking, technology,
collaboration, learning vehicle, and so on.

This article emphasizes on the interplay between a firm's
exercised strategic behavior (outsourcing, collaboration,
and offshoring) and managerial strategic cognition and
suggests there is significance between the two (Kim, 2012).
Furthermore, it develops managerial capabilities into
strategic cognition and managerial openness to networking,
technology, and information sharing toward innovation.
This is a more industrial-specific and practice-grasping
approach to strategic cognitive algorithms than abstract
ones: strategic link (Morrow, 2001), strategic relevance
(Ponzi, 2002), strategic business link (Broadbent, 1998;
Zack, 1999), givens (March & Simon, 1958), sense-making
(Weick, 1995), interpretive schemes (Daft & Weick, 1984),
and dominant logic (Prahalad & Bettis, 1986). Strategic
cognition is important as it provides intra-relationships
between managerial capabilities and inter-relationships with
strategies implementation and achieving innovation (Kim,
2012).
Conducting R&D collaboration strategies (domestic
and/or offshore) is understood as efficient innovation
strategy that requires management's high level of strategic
cognition and openness. The collaboration strategy is
involved with multi-step operations that managers make
new patterns of decisions through. This perspective
contrasts with organizational rigidity where management
repeats historical patterns of R&D procurement reflecting
ingrained repertoires (Simon, 1947), search rules (Cyert &
March, 1963), operating procedures (Allison, 1971), and
routines (Nelson & Winter, 1982).
This article begins by providing a general background of
the pharmaceutical industry including industrial logic, the
importance of R&D, as well as current industry challenges.
Next, it discusses the current success models and an
industrial success factor involved in them, followed by an
illustration of the most preferred strategies for achieving
efficient innovation. Finally, the article demonstrates the
significance of R&D management capabilities regarding
industrial logic, strategies, and the EIM.
Missing Link: R&D Management
Capabilities
To understand pharmaceutical industry's logic, it is critical
to understand the significance of R&D and its managerial
capabilities. It is not easy, however, to have a holistic view
of R&D by using annual financial performance reports as a
yardstick. R&D has not brought short-term outcomes
related to investments. In addition, even when analyzing
R&D's long-term outcomes, it is hard to articulate R&D
function by relating econometric data such as market value.
For example, past studies in R&D spending announcements
and positive share-price reactions (Chan, Martin, &
Kensinger, 1990; Doukas & Switzer, 1992) suggested that
R&D expenditure does not ensure consistent long-term
contribution to shareholder value (Chauvin & Hirschey,
1993).
Therefore, rather than relying on econometric analyses,
it is critical to focus on the industrial success­­innovative
treatments or products. Besides, it should be achieved in a
fast and confidential manner to earn patents, all necessary
components of staying ahead of competitors in this
industry. Hence, managerial capabilities play an essential
role at identifying industrial characteristic opportunities that
include the early detection of potential from raw data, such
as a new technology or a new regulation, and making sense
out of that raw data. Understanding industrial logic is
crucial to formulating success models and conducting R&D
strategies is imperative for innovation. In this way,
management capabilities function at the core of R&D and
its innovation activities.
Pharmaceutical Industry Overview
To understand R&D significance, it is necessary to have a
general understanding of the R&D processes in the
pharmaceutical industry. The following section aims to
address reports on R&D management's role as a
determining factor of a company's success. This
background research serves as the foundation for attaining
an industrial logic.
Importance of R&D in Pharmaceuticals
R&D is at the core of the pharmaceutical industry in terms
of generating patents and exclusive rights over time. This
legal rewarding system is linked to monetary rewards, such
as retention of profits and preventing competitors from
catching up or copying information knowledge. Under this
structure, the well-known blockbuster model drugs
appeared in the 1980s targeting mass markets with a focus
on prevalent cardiovascular or metabolic diseases such as
hypertension, peptic ulcers, and lipid metabolism disorders.
Good examples of these drugs are enalapril, ramipril,
cimetidine, ranitidine, and atorvastatin (Lipitor). Lipitor
was only the sixth HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor entering
the market for the treatment of lipid metabolism disorders
and provided over $10 billion in annual sales (Nickisch,
Greuel, & Bode-Greuel, 2009).
Current Challenges of Pharmaceutical Industry
Regulation, patents, and globalized competitors.
Pharmaceutical industry has faced stricter regulations for
the last 10 years. Compared with other major markets that
regulate drug prices directly or indirectly, drug prices in the
U.S. pharmaceutical market were largely unregulated. Since
2002, increasing numbers of pharmaceutical patents have
been expiring; consequently, domestic companies
producing generic drugs are posing greater threats to "big
pharma." Pharmaceutical price controls in the United States
also began with the passage of the Medicare Modernization
Act (MMA) in 2003. Furthermore, R&D in pharmaceutical
Kim 3
companies has been fast growing in India, Brazil, and
Asia--especially China (Howells, 2008). They may take
advantage of this situation by sharing information about
products with expired patents and improving manufacturing
capabilities. However, globalization notwithstanding, the
United States still specializes in searching for new
treatments and new drugs.
Declining productivity. The pharmaceutical industry has been
experiencing low productivity mostly stemming from
extensive requirements in clinical trials (requirements
understood as an exchange for possible exclusivities and
returns on R&D investments). According to pharmaceutical
industry representatives, the current pricing structure is
necessary both to cover the high fixed costs of R&D
operations and to maintain R&D investment for the future
(Abbott & Vernon, 2007). However, within a decade,
productivity got worse in terms of the success ratio of
clinical trials and commercialization. In 1995, only 1 in
5,000 compounds made it all the way through the maze of
clinical trials and approvals to the market (Studt & Cassidy,
1995). More recently (1992-1999), however, successful
models have changed and only 10% of drugs entering
development reach the market, with only 20% of marketed
drugs recovering their investment. The entire drug
development process is very lengthy--8 to 12 years--and
extremely costly--$802 million (DiMasi et al., 2003) to
$868 million (Adams & Brantner, 2006) for each new drug.
Furthermore, additional drugs with total annual sales of
$170 billion will lose their patents by 2015 (Nickisch et al.,
2009).
Formulation of EIM
Current Success Models
Research into existing products and their markets helps
conceptualize what constitutes success in the
pharmaceutical industry. To conceptualize what constitutes
success in this industry, existing products and their markets
were investigated. Broadly, there are three types of products
in the current market. The first type is a producer-driven for
branded products, the second is a buyer-driven model for
quality generics for high-end markets, and the third is
generics for low-end markets (Haakonsson, 2009). Branded
products are known as blockbuster models, which are the
most preferred success model by pharmaceutical companies
as they provide a monopoly period by granting a patent and
market exclusivity. On the other hand, "specialty pharma"
approaches have also been successful since they
differentiate markets and products from Big Pharma's main
interest in the mass market (Nickisch et al., 2009). These
specialty pharma approaches were based on the
diversification of products and marketing in the
pharmaceutical industry and each company's unique
capabilities.
According to Kambhammettu (2007), "specialty
pharma" approach can be categorized as follows:
· Niche therapeutic area/orphan disease concentrators
focus on specific therapeutic segments such as
ophthalmology, specific tumor types, and other rare
but serious diseases. Examples are Genzyme, Alcan,
and Actelion.
· Portfolio adapters pursue the products de-prioritized
by big pharma and increase sales volume by means of
additional development investments and intensive
marketing. Shire and King Pharmaceuticals are in this
type.
· Licensing experts license early and late stage
development candidates and complete development
toward approval. Helsinn Pharma is an example of
this type.
· Drug delivery experts reformulate existing molecules
to enhance their therapeutic application. Nektar and
Elan apply this approach.
· Specialty generic companies develop their own
branded generics by reformulating existing products.
Barr and Watson use this approach.
From a R&D managerial perspective, the most preferred
success models are either blockbuster models or orphan
disease concentrate models. Blockbuster models target mass
markets by focusing on prevalent cardiovascular or
metabolic diseases with a bigger population of patients,
such as diabetes or high cholesterol, while orphan disease
concentrators target smaller populations of patients.
However, both success models must contain innovative
knowledge of treatments to concretely achieve any form of
new valuable intellectual property, licensing, patents, and
market exclusivity. As such, current FDA regulation legally
rewards innovative treatments with the award of patent,
market exclusivity, and FDA approval time reduction.
As predicted a decade ago, patents and market
exclusivity of currently successful models are expiring; in
2011, Pfizer lost a $10-billion-a-year revenue from Lipitor
due to patent expiration. Furthermore, the failure of clinical
trials to replace Lipitor made Pfizer's CEO call for a
reinvention. Merck discontinued one of two major clinical
trials of a blood thinner that caused dangerous amounts of
bleeding in some patients. The industry faces more of these
types of challenges and thus, R&D management needs
urgent solutions.
New Model of Innovation Management
The best way of overcoming these industrial challenges is
to build efficient R&D to produce innovative products and
keep more products in the pipeline. Pharmaceutical R&D
management needs a new model of innovation management
for enabling innovation and efficiency. However, these are
conflicting ideas in management theory. Efficiency
4 SAGE Open
management is characterized as a linear process that
focuses on reducing costs and time. On the other hand,
innovation management is typically referred to as a chaotic
process in terms of nonlinear relationship between actions
and outcomes over time (Cheng & Van de Ven, 1996),
making it a complex adaptive system (Trochim, Cabrera,
Milstein, Gallagher, & Leischow, 2006). In this respect,
pharmaceutical R&D management should go beyond what
most management theories define in terms of efficiency and
innovation--a call to think outside the box.
EIM
Efficient innovation is an industrial and managerial success
model that pharmaceutical R&D pursues. The most
determinant success factor of R&D management is to
discover an innovative treatment or an innovative way of
treatment faster than a competitor discovers it. Without
efficient innovation, the firm cannot claim any exclusive
right over other competitors--a basic rule and necessity in
the pharmaceutical industry. In the pharmaceutical industry,
competition is highly globalized and new technologies are
quickly emerging.
To have efficient innovation, companies must pursue
various collaborations and networks, rather than solely
building internal capabilities within companies themselves.
Hence, the first way to create efficient innovation is
allowing R&D management to utilize collaboration,
outsourcing, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A)
strategies to actively search for materials and skills that
might be crucial for gaining potentially new drug
candidates before competitors. Powell (1998) observed that
in addition to managing inter-organizational networking,
the capability of managing R&D collaboration strategy is a
key driver of organizational and knowledge management.
The second way to pursue efficient innovation is with
strategic decision making that translates into cost reduction.
According to DiMasi (2002), the earlier a decision is made,
the less out-of-pocket drug discovery and development
costs a company incurs in the future. Reducing phase times
by 41.3% or increasing the clinical success rate from 30.4%
to 31.7% would yield a $200 million cost reduction.
Though this study highlighted the importance of decision
making by R&D managers, there was no direct study to
connect R&D managers with strategic cognition in relation
to strategic behavior (collaboration or offshoring; firms'
strategic behavior) and innovation (success).
The pharmaceutical industry achieves success by new
drug development, which must contain an innovative
component--new or better treatments in the market. Under
this industrial logic, a firm legally achieves market
exclusivity when FDA approves a new treatment; however,
conceptually, a firm's R&D achieves this through new
knowledge creation. Hence, conceptually, drug
development is a process of generating innovative
knowledge where R&D management pursues the creation
of new drugs through the refinement of existing materials
into therapeutically more effective drugs. Essentially,
pharmaceutical R&D needs to address both refining the
concepts and efficiently identifying innovative knowledge
for new drug creation (Elmquist & Segrestin, 2007). Drug
discovery and development processes necessitate a high
level of managerial openness as well as strategic cognition
that enable management to stay focused on collective and
cumulative knowledge processes. Hence, the EIM is
determined by firms' strategic behavior and high level of
managerial capabilities, strategic cognition, and managerial
openness.
The Most Preferred Pharmaceutical R&D
Strategies
Following an understanding of the EIM, it is important to
discuss current R&D strategies. The two most preferred
R&D collaboration strategies are outsourcing and
offshoring. Outsourcing strategy has been historically
important in United States and offshoring R&D strategy has
been globalized, which remains understudied regarding
efficient innovation and relationship with managerial
capabilities.
R&D Outsourcing Strategy
Since the late 1970s, the pharmaceutical industry has had
challenges and changes relating to the entry of
biotechnology and biopharmaceutical firms (Powell, Koput,
& Smith-Doerr, 1996; Shan, Walker, & Kogut, 1994;
Walsh, 1995). From a knowledge perspective, these
changes have been associated with new knowledge areas
such as cell and molecular biology, pharmacology,
physiology in the pharmaceutical industry (McKelvey,
1995; Orsenigo, 1989; Valle & Gambardella, 1993). The
traditional pharmaceutical industry, mostly driven by
chemistry, got involved in new and flexible companies
called new biotechnology-based firms (NBFs). This
industrial discontinuity caused large pharmaceutical firms
to seek partnerships with these NBFs to adapt to new
industrial change and increase opportunities. In this way,
large generalist pharmaceutical firms have found
outsourcing useful. Through these interactive partnerships
and contracts, the NBFs have also found advantages in
managing the high costs of development and marketing,
since specialist contract research organizations (CROs)
centered especially on clinical trial and testing work
(Howells, Gagliardi, & Malik, 2008). For this reason,
outsourcing has brought mutual benefits to both parties.
Specifically, it stimulated many knowledge spillover effects
near pharmaceutical R&D outsourcing sites.
Outsourcing strategies were what pharmaceutical
companies had developed to deal with these new entrants,
which were equipped with new knowledge and
organizational flexibility. Hence, the previously dominant
Kim 5
pharmaceutical companies have been more flexible and
faster via external collaboration with NBFs (Pisano, 1994;
Pisano, Shan, & Teece, 1988). There have been three
tendencies regarding outsourcing strategies. The first is that
companies are outsourcing what they do not consider their
core business areas (Howells et al., 2008). A second recent
tendency among the producers of branded pharmaceuticals
is that they focus on similar areas of competence. Finally,
there is a shift in R&D strategy to externalize their research
activities by buying upcoming biotech companies, which
may have a new product in their laboratory but not the
financial power or distribution systems to market it
(Haakonsson, 2009).
Overall, outsourcing strategies have boosted innovation
through interaction with NBFs (Orsenigo, Pammolli, &
Riccaboni, 2001). In addition, there is a reduction on
development time and cost benefits when using outsourcing
strategies (Howells et al., 2008).
Offshoring R&D Strategy
The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectural
Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) officially globalized the pharmaceutical industry
(Haakonsson, 2009), and offshoring R&D became a
mainstream practice. According to a study by Chacar and
Lieberman (2003), U.S. pharmaceutical companies'
international acquisitions and establishment of foreign
research laboratories are reaping benefits in drug discovery
by globalizing their R&D networks. Globalized R&D
showed innovative output: the annual number of "new
chemical entities" (NCEs) approved by the U.S. FDA and
the annual number of U.S. patents granted increased
significantly. Offshoring R&D attempts to overcome
excessive centralization or bureaucratic diseconomies of
R&D (Williamson, 1991). This includes the rapid
expansion of economies in China, India, and Brazil,
coupled with the desire to get closer to consumers in
relation to R&D activity.
Despite the many supply-led claims of R&D
globalization, the demand side strongly correlates with the
expansion of foreign R&D. Many multi-national companies
are not only facing ever-shorter development cycles;
however, they are simultaneously confronting wider
geographical spans of their R&D establishments.
Constructs of R&D Management
Capability
As previously described, R&D collaboration strategies,
outsourcing, and offshoring R&D are the most preferred
strategies in pursuit of efficient innovation. These strategies
involve coordinating and combining external and internal
R&D resources, which are known as innovation capabilities
(Coombs & Metcalfe, 2002). In this view, innovative
managerial capability is essential in successfully conducting
R&D collaboration strategies. R&D managerial capabilities
are strategic cognition and managerial openness, where
managerial openness consists of the openness to new
technology, openness to networking, and openness to
information sharing. These are the keys to implementing,
optimizing, and making the most of outsourcing and
offshoring R&D strategies.
Strategic cognition is one of the innovative R&D
managerial capabilities of visualizing the potential that a
new treatment can offer to patients and its potential impact
on the market. Without a high level of strategic cognition,
managers may not be willing to take risks in leveraging
current resources for the future (see Ansoff, 1965, p. 181).
Strategic cognition helps envision the potential of a new
treatment, aggressively exploiting internal resources as well
as exploring external resources. In the process of drug
development, a certain level of resource deficiency always
occurs, which is overcome by R&D collaboration strategies
that explore external resources. Thus, innovation is
achieved through the capability of implementation (Coombs
& Metcalfe, 2002) and targeted by managers and by their
strategic decisions (Bessant & Francis, 2005). At this point,
strategic cognition becomes significant for pursuing
innovation in more efficient ways than competitors do.
The significance of strategic cognition becomes evident
in the context of the managerial implementation of R&D
collaboration strategies. The managerial capability of
conducting R&D collaboration strategy is a key to
knowledge management (Powell, 1998). The high level of
managerial strategic cognition and exercised strategies are
linked to innovation (Kim, 2012). In implementing R&D
collaboration strategies and exploring external knowledge
through them, managers' capabilities extend beyond the
concept of operational management that prioritizes
efficiency and short-term economic outcomes (Ackoff,
1990, p. 523; Ansoff, 1965, pp. 5-6).
Managerial openness to new technologies--another
construct of managerial capabilities--is managerial
perception and practice toward new technologies. It gains
significance by understanding the impact of new
technologies in pharmaceutical industry. New technologies
evidently are an industrial characteristic factor that caused
industrial shift by allowing NBFs in pharmaceutical history.
New technology ushered NBFs' successful entry (Darby &
Zucker, 1997) and drove incumbent pharmaceuticals to
collaborate with them (Howells et al., 2008; Orsenigo,
Pammolli, Riccaboni, Bonaccorsi, & Turchetti, 1997). In a
recent study, managerial openness to new technologies is
linked to innovation (Kim, 2012), highlighting its
importance in efficient innovation.
Openness to networking and openness to information
sharing are the two other important constructs of
managerial capabilities that gain significance by
understanding the drug discovery and development process.
The work of Elmquist and Segrestin (2007) showed that the
drug discovery process is more of a creative process
6 SAGE Open
wherein new concepts and knowledge are continually
generated. While doing so, R&D management functions as
knowledge interpreters and innovative knowledge
generators. Drug discovery and development processes
necessitate a managerial openness that enables management
to stay focused on collective and cumulative knowledge
process, as well as strategic cognition.
Managerial openness to networking is highly related to
innovation. In the process of innovation, R&D managers
both individually and organizationally expand the boundary
of knowledge. Thus, the innovative knowledge is
strategically accumulated, expanded, and generated by
R&D management via communication. During the process
of developing and introducing innovation, R&D
communication networks are significant at the inter- and
intra-firm levels (Tushman, 1979). In a knowledge
expansion or organizational learning process, a common
code of communication and coordinated search procedure
are important (Teece et al., 1997). As the prior studies
addressed the importance of networks, accordingly,
managerial openness to networking is critical in sharing and
expanding knowledge. It includes networking with R&D
staffs, with other department managers (over R&D), within
firms, and between firms (i.e., with R&D managers at other
firms). According to Powell et al.'s (1996) study on inter-
organizational collaboration in biotechnology, firms
embedded in benefit-rich networks are likely to have
greater innovative performance as well.
Managerial openness to information sharing is highly
related to innovation. Early studies showed that information
sharing between and within organizations was one of the
critical factors for organizational creativity (Clitheroe,
Stokols, & Zmuidzinas, 1998; Ford, 1996; Woodman,
Sawyer, & Griffin, 1993). Furthermore, recently, the R&D
networks are considered a flow of information (Whelan,
Teigland, Donnellan, & Golden, 2010). R&D professionals
use three external information sources: personal contacts,
Internet sources, and academic publications (Whelan et al.,
2010). Conclusively, it is critical for R&D managers to
have high level of openness to networking and information
sharing to increase innovation.
Strategic cognition and openness--cognitive
flexibility--are the main attributes of strategic managers.
Both these attributes represent two aspects of strategic
thinking--metacognition (the process of thinking about
thinking) and leadership (Industrial College of the Armed
Forces, 2001). Strategic managers are like strategic leaders
as they lead organizations toward the targeted positions in
the market, achieve the organization's goals, and help shape
future norms and rules in the industry (Kang & Afuah,
2010). From this perspective, strategic managers tend to be
more creative and are referred to as map makers rather than
map users (Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, & Lampel, 1998, pp.
159-160). The strategic cognition is referred to as long-term
planning (Pascale, 1999), high level of conceptualization
(Industrial College of the Armed Forces, 2001), and the
intuition of bringing all together of knowledge and
experience (Mintzberg et al., 1998).
In implementing R&D collaboration strategies and
pursuing innovation, both strategic cognition and
managerial openness play significant roles. Strategic
cognition and managerial openness are vital since R&D
managers aggressively exploit external sources for
innovative opportunities. Day (1994) observed that
managers' mental models provide a shared ideology that
enables collective interpretation of market reality, and thus
these models play a key role in managerial decisions about
capability enhancement and renewal. When managers
interpret the market situation as an opportunity rather than a
threat, their cognitive flexibility is engaged and they tend to
more aggressively invest resources in new strategic
initiatives (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; White, Varadarajan, &
Dacin, 2003).
R&D is essentially a constant, lengthy discovery process
toward creation (Elmquist & Segrestin, 2007). Managerial
openness becomes critical in the drug discovery and
development process that consists of multi-steps with
diverse experts. During pharmaceutical R&D
management's pursuit of innovation, there are multi-interim
steps toward newness that require managerial openness.
Therefore, when managers pursue innovation, innovative
treatments or products, they strategically position
themselves toward innovative knowledge and potential
opportunities for innovative knowledge generation.
Managerial openness can be measured by the
perceptions and practice of R&D managers regarding
networking and information sharing. This involves
interaction with others in a social context called
participative openness (Senge, 1992). Information sharing
is more delicate than networking in this industry, which
tends to pursue confidentiality of appropriated knowledge.
This is close to Senge's reflective openness that contains a
cerebral response to the ideas of others but does not involve
direct social interaction with others.
By contextualizing industrial logic and industrial success
models, this study formulates EIM that optimizes efficient
innovation with R&D strategies and managerial capabilities.
EIM situates R&D managerial capabilities at the core of it
and demonstrates the significance of optimal R&D
management capabilities. The R&D managerial capabilities;
openness to information sharing, networking, and new
technology; and strategic cognition, are essential to pursuing
innovation and strategizing decision making to exploit
internal/external resources (Kim, 2012). Pharmaceutical
companies need to develop and grow these R&D
management capabilities in pursuit of innovation.
Conclusion
This article formulated an EIM to redefine industrial
success and achieve efficient innovation. The EIM
strengthens innovative managerial capabilities and actively
Kim 7
deploys R&D strategies by identifying industrial turbulence
factors and overcoming resource deficiencies. By using the
EIM, R&D managers are better able to perform efficient
innovation, to achieve industrial success, and to address the
pharmaceutical industry's current challenges including
declining productivity and globalized competition.
Furthermore, the EIM empowers R&D management to
pursue innovative knowledge by strategically exploring
external knowledge. This managerial view addresses
industrial issues, innovative knowledge creation/expansion,
and strategies in a dynamic way that contains multi-
variables. This provides a better approach to innovation
than the conventional way of only looking at the two
dimensions of inputs and outcomes.
In management theory, managerial capabilities, business
models, and industrial logics are mutually interconnected;
business models are the interpretation of management
hypothesis about customers, markets, and the best way of
the firm to meet their needs (Teece, 2010). In Teece's
definition, a business model is organized around the
hypothesis of what customers want or what management
thinks they want; therefore, the unit of analysis in a
business model is its value proposal. Industrial logics and
business models are closely related as these anticipations
are formed from within a manager's mind-set, which stem
from their reading of the industry's dominant logic. In
short, managers create the business models by interpreting
the industry's dominant logic. Furthermore, there is an
implicit association between business models and strategy,
as strategy refers to the choice of business models through
which the firm will compete in a marketplace (Casadesus-
Masanell & Ricart, 2010, p. 196).
The main contribution of this article is shedding light on
the important relationship between managerial capabilities,
strategies, and innovation (an industrial success model).
Firms achieve innovation through a focus on strategic
behavior and developing innovative managerial capabilities,
specifically strategic cognition and managerial openness
(Kim, 2012). The underlying premise behind the EIM is
that managers are at the core of every decision-making and
strategic behavior. When managers possess high level of
openness to new information, new technologies, and
networking, then, they tend to identify industrial turbulence
factors and industrial success models. On the other hand,
when managers possess high levels of strategic cognition,
they facilitate long-term planning for strategic goals and are
willing to make strategic decisions about resource
utilization or deficiency, such as collaboration strategies. In
addition, this article contributes to current management
literature by building constructs of managerial capabilities
(Kim, 2012). Dynamic capabilities did not specify
constructs, though illustrated as "the ability to integrate,
adapt, and configurate internal and external resources"
(Teece et al., 1997, p. 516). This research demonstrates the
importance of managerial practitioners to emphasize core
capabilities to achieve innovation.
In today's current market, pharmaceutical R&D needs
optimal managerial capabilities to evaluate current moves in
the marketplace, formulate success models, and create
competitive strategies to take preemptive actions in the fast-
changing global environment. In other words, companies
will achieve efficient innovation when they focus on
developing high levels of strategic cognition and
managerial openness. Hence, this article offers internal
locus view of innovation that pharmaceutical R&D needs to
efficiently generate.
