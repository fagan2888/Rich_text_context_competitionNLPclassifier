Changing Trends in Hepatitis C­Related Mortality in
the United States, 1995-2004

The disease burden and mortality from hepatitis C are predicted to increase in the United States
as the number of persons with long-standing chronic infection grows. We analyzed hepatitis C
mortality rates derived from US Census and multiple-cause-of-death data for 1995-2004. Deaths
were considered hepatitis C­related if: (1) hepatitis C was the underlying cause of death, (2)
chronic liver disease was the underlying cause and hepatitis C was a contributing cause, or (3)
human immunodeficiency virus was the underlying cause and chronic liver disease and hepatitis
C were contributing causes. A total of 56,409 hepatitis C­related deaths were identified. Mor-
tality rates increased 123% during the study period (1.09 per 100,000 persons to 2.44 per
100,000), but average annual increases were smaller during 2000-2004 than 1995-1999. After
peaking in 2002 (2.57 per 100,000), overall rates declined slightly, but continued to increase
among persons aged 55-64 years. Overall increases were greater among males (144%) than
females (81%) and among non-Hispanic blacks (170%) and Native Americans (241%) com-
pared to non-Hispanic whites (124%) and Hispanics (84%). The 7,427 hepatitis C deaths in
2004 (mean age: 55 years), corresponded to 148,611 years of potential life lost. The highest
mortality rates in 2004 were observed among males, persons aged 45-54 and 55-64 years, His-
panics, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic Native American/Alaska Natives. Conclusion:
Overall, hepatitis C mortality has increased substantially since 1995. Despite small declines in
recent years, rates have continued to increase among persons aged 55-64 years. Hepatitis C is an
important cause of premature mortality. (HEPATOLOGY 2008;47:1128-1135.)
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most
common blood-borne infection in the United
States, with an estimated 1.3% of the general
US population chronically infected.1 About 10%-20%
of chronically infected persons will develop liver cir-
rhosis and 1%-5% will develop hepatocellular carci-
noma within 20-30 years of infection.2 In a 2005
report, chronic HCV infection was shown to be the
leading indication for liver transplantation in the
United States.3
Alcohol use, age at infection, duration of HCV infec-
tion, and male sex are all associated with progression of
liver fibrosis, development of cirrhosis, and subsequent
mortality among persons with chronic HCV infection.4,5
Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
is also an important prognostic factor influencing the
course of HCV infection6 and occurs commonly among
persons infected with HCV due to injection drug use and
other shared modes of transmission. Advances in antiret-
roviral therapy have extended the life of many HIV-in-
fected persons, such that persons coinfected with HIV
and HCV often live long enough to develop the sequelae
of hepatitis C­related chronic liver disease.7 Liver disease
is now a leading cause of death among persons infected
with HIV.8
Several lines of evidence suggest that the disease bur-
den and mortality from chronic HCV infection may in-
crease in the coming years. Comparison of the age-specific
prevalence of HCV infection during 1988-1994 and
1999-2002 showed that the peak prevalence of infection

had shifted from persons 30-39 years of age to persons
40-49 years of age, and that approximately two-thirds of
infected participants in both surveys were born between
1945 and 1964.1,9 These data, as well as results of math-
ematical models, suggest that the number of persons
chronically infected for more than 20 years will continue
to rise over the next decade.10 Results of a mathematical
modeling study predicted that the annual number of hep-
atitis C­related deaths would increase from an estimated
8,000 in 1991 to 18,000 annually between 2010 and
2019, based on past hepatitis C mortality, hepatocellular
carcinoma incidence, liver transplantation, alcohol use,
and mortality related to other causes.11
Few studies provide data on the population impact
of chronic HCV infection on mortality in the United
States, largely due to the difficulty of correctly identi-
fying the infection as a cause of death. Using US death
record data, Vong and Bell found that 4,443 deaths
were linked to hepatitis C in 1998, a 220% increase in
age-adjusted mortality rates since 1993, although these
numbers were considered to be an underestimate.12 In
addition, these data are now nearly a decade old, a time
period in which large increases in hepatitis C­related
mortality were expected.
We examined United States multiple-cause-of-death
(MCOD) data from 1995-2004 in order to provide more
current, population-based estimates of trends and demo-
graphic differences in hepatitis C­related mortality utiliz-
ing a broader case definition than has been employed in
previous population-based studies of hepatitis C­related
mortality.
Patients and Methods
We obtained MCOD data from the National Center
for Health Statistics for deaths due to hepatitis C­related
disease from 1995 to 2004 occurring among persons re-
siding in the United States. Data from this period were
used because 2004 is the most recent data year available
and HCV testing and diagnostic practices did not begin
to stabilize until 1995. State and local laws require that
death certificates be completed for all deaths, with funeral
directors or hospitals required to collect demographic in-
formation on decedents and physicians or medical exam-
iners required to complete information on the condition
or conditions leading to death. The 2003 Standard US
Death Certificate, upon which each state's death certifi-
cate is based, has two sections for cause-of-death informa-
tion.13 Part I includes information on the conditions
involved in the causal chain of events leading to death.
This includes the "underlying cause of death", the "im-
mediate cause of death", and any conditions causally link-
ing the underlying and immediate causes of death. The
underlying cause of death is typically used to compile
traditional mortality statistics and is defined as "the dis-
ease or injury that initiated the train of events leading
directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or
violence, which produced the fatal injury".14 Part II in-
cludes information on other "significant conditions con-
tributing to death but not resulting in the underlying
cause given in Part I."
MCOD files incorporate the information from Parts
I and II of the death certificate using three schemes: the
entity axis, the record axis, and the underlying cause of
death. The entity axis contains every condition re-
corded in Parts I and II of the death certificate. These
data are not cleaned, processed, or recoded and repre-
sent a direct transcription of each disease entity listed
on the death certificate to the MCOD data file. The
record axis represents a cleaned version of the entity
axis in which redundant conditions are eliminated, re-
lated conditions may be combined for coding effi-
ciency, and causes violating certain logical checks are
deleted.14 The underlying cause of death is a single
variable separate from both the entity and record axes,
which typically contains the underlying cause of death
as recorded in Part I of the death certificate, but may
contain a derived value based on selection and modifi-
cation rules designed to improve the usefulness of un-
derlying cause mortality statistics.14 For the purposes
of the current study, any condition captured in the
MCOD data not classified as the underlying cause of
death was considered a contributing cause of death.
Medical conditions recorded in MCOD data from
1995 to 1998 were coded in accordance with the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9)
and MCOD data from 1999 to 2004 were coded in
accordance with the International Classification of Dis-
eases, 10th Revision (ICD-10).15,16
For this study, a hepatitis C­related death was defined
in one of three ways. First, any death with hepatitis C as
the underlying cause of death was included (ICD-9 codes
070.4 and 070.5 and ICD-10 codes B17.1 and B18.2).
Second, any death with chronic liver disease as the under-
lying cause (primary liver cancer, esophageal varices, alco-
holic liver disease, hepatic failure, chronic hepatitis, liver
cirrhosis/fibrosis, portal hypertension, or hepatorenal
syndrome) and hepatitis C as a contributing cause in the
record axis was included. Third, any death with HIV/
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (ICD-9
codes 042-044.9 and ICD-10 codes B20-B24.9) as the
underlying cause, chronic liver disease as a contributing
cause in the record axis, and hepatitis C as a contributing
cause in either the record or entity axis was included. This
third definition was employed to ensure that HIV/HCV

coinfected persons with evidence of liver disease were not
excluded due to the frequent assignment of HIV as the
underlying cause of death when HIV is listed on the death
certificate.
To calculate mortality rates, we obtained bridged pop-
ulation estimates from the United States Census Bureau
for years 1995-2004.17 Age-adjusted mortality rates were
calculated as well as 95% confidence intervals. Age-ad-
justed rates were standardized to the age distribution of
the year 2000 United States population. Variance esti-
mates for rates were calculated based on a Poisson distri-
bution. Information on age, sex, race, ethnicity, and year
of death was also obtained from the MCOD data. A single
race/ethnicity variable was created in which any decedent
listing Hispanic ethnicity was considered Hispanic, with
all remaining non-Hispanic deaths categorized according
to the race groups white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander,
and Native American/Alaska Native. Linear plots through
annual age-adjusted mortality rates were used to quantify
rate changes over time. The appropriateness of using a
linear model was assessed by visual inspections of the plots
as well as calculation of R-squared values. Although
among a small number of subgroups annual age-adjusted
rates did appear to deviate from the plots, linear methods
performed better than the use of Poisson exponential rate
models. Years of potential life lost (YPLL) were calculated
by subtracting decedents' ages at death from 75 for all
deaths occurring before age 75 and summing the individ-
ual years of life lost across all decedents. Although numer-
ous methods have been outlined in the literature for
calculation of YPLL,18 we used a single age cutoff of 75
years for all groups in order to be consistent with YPLL
data obtained on other infectious causes of death from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based
Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System.19 We ana-
lyzed and tabulated data with SAS, version 9.1 (SAS In-
stitute Inc., Cary, NC) and Excel 2002 (Microsoft Corp.,
Redmond, WA).
Results
In the United States from 1995 to 2004, a total of
84,078 deaths mentioned hepatitis C somewhere on the
death certificate, with 56,409 (67.1%) of these meeting
one of the three criteria for inclusion in the study. Sub-
jects determined to be ineligible for inclusion tended to be
older, were less likely to be non-Hispanic black, and com-
monly had as underlying causes of death heart disease,
HIV/AIDS, malignant neoplasms of sites other than the
liver, non-C viral hepatitis, accidents, and diabetes. Of
the eligible subjects, 37,211 (66.0%) were included be-
cause hepatitis C was listed as the underlying cause of
death, 16,863 (29.9%) were included because chronic
liver disease was the underlying cause and hepatitis C was
mentioned as a contributing cause, and 2,335 (4.1%)
were included because HIV was the underlying cause and
chronic liver disease and hepatitis C were mentioned as
contributing causes. Among the 19,198 decedents in-
cluded in the study not listing hepatitis C as the underly-
ing cause of death, 39.8% listed liver cancer as the
underlying cause, 31.8% listed alcoholic liver disease,
15.1% listed fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver, 12.2% listed
HIV/AIDS, and 1.1% listed other underlying causes.
Four deaths were excluded from rate calculations due to
missing information on age.
Age-adjusted hepatitis C­related mortality rates in-
creased substantially during the study period, rising from
1.09 deaths per 100,000 persons in 1995 to 2.57 per
100,000 in 2002 before declining slightly to 2.44 per
100,000 in 2004. Average annual mortality rate increases
were smaller during 2000-2004 than during 1995-1999
(Fig. 1, Table 1). Although mortality rates from hepatitis
C­related disease increased considerably during 1995-
2004 for men and women, rates in men did so more
rapidly, increasing by an average of 0.26 deaths per
100,000 each year (Fig. 1, Table 1). The most dramatic
age-specific increases during the study period were ob-
served among persons 45-54 years of age and persons
55-64 years of age, with rates increasing 376% from 1.76
to 8.01 per 100,000 and 188% from 2.22 to 6.05 per
100,000, respectively (Fig. 2, Table 1). The groups in
which peak age-specific mortality rates were seen shifted
from persons age 65 and over in 1995 to persons age
45-54 and 55-64 in 2004 (Fig. 2, Table 1). Age-adjusted
race/ethnicity-specific mortality rates also increased over
the study period for all groups, with the most rapid in-
creases among non-Hispanic blacks and Native Ameri-
cans/Alaska Natives (Fig. 3, Table 1). Some of the most
substantial mortality rate increases observed among spe-
cific subgroups during the study period were among non-
Hispanic black males aged 55-64 (3.81 to 21.94 per
100,000) and non-Hispanic white males aged 45-54
(2.21 to 11.34 per 100,000).
Relative to the rapid rise in rates during 1995-1999,
changes in age-adjusted hepatitis C­related mortality
were generally modest during 2000-2004 (Figs. 1-3 and
Table 1). Overall hepatitis C­related mortality rates rose
by 0.24 deaths per 100,000 per year during 1995-1999
and by 0.02 deaths per 100,000 per year during 2000-
2004. Rates declined during 2000-2004 among Hispan-
ics (0.17 deaths per 100,000 per year) and non-
Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders (0.11 deaths per
100,000 per year), and among the youngest and oldest age
groups. However, rates continued to rise among persons
45-54 and 55-64 years of age, with similar average in-

creases during the two time periods in the latter age group
(0.35 deaths per 100,000 per year and 0.37 deaths per
100,000 per year) (Table 1).
In 2004, the most recent data year available, 7,427
hepatitis C­related deaths occurred, representing an age-
adjusted mortality rate of 2.44 deaths per 100,000 per-
sons (95% confidence interval 2.38, 2.50) (Table 1). The
mean age of death was 55.5 years in 2004, and a total of
148,611 years of potential life were lost. Mortality rates
were nearly 2.5 times higher among men than women,
and mortality among non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics,
and non-Hispanic Native Americans were roughly double
the rates observed for non-Hispanic whites and Asian/
Pacific Islanders (Table 1). Age-specific rates were highest
among persons 45-54 years of age (Table 1), although
peak age-specific mortality varied by race/ethnicity and
sex. The highest mortality rates observed for age-race/
ethnicity-sex-specific subgroups were among non-His-
panic black and Hispanic men aged 55 to 64 (21.94 and
18.81 per 100,000, respectively) and non-Hispanic black
and Hispanic men aged 45 to 54 (19.23 and 17.80 deaths
per 100,000, respectively).
Major sequelae of hepatitis C were recorded among
nearly all hepatitis C­related deaths in 2004. Overall,
83.8% of deaths had evidence of chronic liver disease in
addition to HCV infection, including 43.5% with cirrho-
sis or fibrosis of the liver, 31.6% with hepatic failure, and
18.3% with primary liver cancer. Alcohol-related condi-
tions were also prominent among hepatitis C­related
deaths, with 20.0% including mention of alcoholic liver
disease, alcohol dependence syndrome, or harmful use of
alcohol as either the underlying or a contributing cause of
death. A total of 388 (5.2%) hepatitis C­related deaths
mentioned HIV/AIDS in 2004 with a mean age at death
of 47.8 years.
Analysis of data limited to deaths listing hepatitis C as
the underlying cause yielded similar mortality time trends
and demographic disparities as the three-part case defini-
tion employed in this analysis.
Discussion
This analysis of recent death certificate data demon-
strates the substantial and generally rising burden of hep-
atitis C­related mortality, and highlights the contribution
of hepatitis C­related disease to premature mortality. Ac-
cording to the analysis of YPLL, hepatitis C­related dis-
ease was the 16th leading cause of premature death in the
United States in 2004, and the fourth leading infectious

enza and pneumonia, and septicemia.19
Understanding trends in hepatitis C­related mortality
is complicated by changes in hepatitis C diagnostic prac-
tices, particularly during the first half of the study period.
Observed increases in mortality during this time likely
reflect both true increases in mortality and the impact of
the growing use of serologic tests for HCV. As such, true
increases in hepatitis C­related mortality during 1995-
1999 were likely more gradual than the observed trends,
and differences in mortality patterns between the time
periods are difficult to interpret.
Mortality rates generally increased over the 10-year
study period, with a small decline in overall mortality
rates observed in the final 2 years of the study. The decline
in mortality during these final years appears to be driven
by decreases in mortality among persons age 65 and over
as well as persons age 35-44. Decreasing rates among per-
sons 35-44 years of age may be due to the fact that the
birth cohorts with the highest prevalence of infection
moved beyond this age range during the study, whereas
the reasons for decreases in persons age 65 are not clear.
Rates among persons age 45-54 leveled in the last 2 years
of the study, whereas rates among persons age 55-64 con-
tinued a strong upward trend. Decedents age 55-64 com-
prised a growing proportion of persons in the high
prevalence birth cohort, 1945-1964, through the study
period, explaining the continued rise in mortality rates in
this group.
Due to the predicted rise in the prevalence of persons
with long-term chronic HCV infection through 2015,10
models have forecast overall hepatitis C­related mortality
to continue to increase over the next decade.11 Beyond the
cohort effects described above, the reasons for the small
decline observed in overall mortality rates, if sustained, are
not clear. Improvements in survival because of advances
in treatment and liver transplantation could delay or pre-
vent some of the anticipated hepatitis C­related mortal-
ity. Alternatively, the variable course of chronic HCV
infection, reflected imprecisely in mathematical models of
hepatitis C natural history, might result in mortality
curves that diverge from predicted trends. It will be nec-
essary to continue to monitor hepatitis C­related mortal-
ity over time to determine whether the small recent
decline represents the beginning of a trend or a temporary
fluctuation.
Alcohol consumption is an important cofactor in
chronic liver disease progression among HCV-infected
persons,4,20,21 and alcohol-related conditions were ob-
served frequently among hepatitis C­related deaths. Fur-
thermore, the frequency of alcohol-related conditions
derived from death certificate data is likely an underesti-
mate, as it has been documented that alcohol dependence
and abuse are underreported on death certificates.22 This
finding highlights the importance of existing recommen-
dations that patients with chronic HCV infection should
not consume alcohol and of identifying more effective
ways to reduce excessive alcohol consumption.23 HIV in-

fection has also been shown to hasten the progression of
chronic liver disease among patients with hepatitis C.6
Although HIV/AIDS was reported in a modest number of
hepatitis C­related deaths, coinfected persons died at a
younger age than persons with hepatitis C alone. Persons
infected with HCV should also be counseled on methods
to avoid HIV infection, if not already infected.
Demographic disparities in mortality were also largely
consistent with observed differences in infection preva-
lence across subgroups. Non-Hispanic blacks, males, and
persons aged 40-49 were observed to have higher preva-
lence of antibodies to HCV in the most recent analysis of
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) and also were observed to have
high mortality rates in the current study.1 This consis-
tency suggests that much of the difference in mortality
rates across demographic groups is simply a function of
differences in infection prevalence, although differences
in the occurrence of prognostic factors influencing case-
fatality may have an effect as well. Mexican Americans
had low infection prevalence, similar to that of non-His-
panic whites, in NHANES,1 but Hispanics were observed
to have high mortality rates in the current study. This
discrepancy could be explained by higher case-fatality
among Hispanics infected with HCV, perhaps related to
differences in the occurrence of comorbidities. It could
also be accounted for, however, by the NHANES sam-
pling frame not allowing for analysis of infection preva-
lence among all Hispanics. If non-Mexican Hispanics
have high HCV infection prevalence, it would be possible
for prevalence of HCV infection among all Hispanics to
be similar to that of non-Hispanic blacks.
Death certificate data have a number of well-known
limitations, one of which is the potential misclassification
of causes of death on the death certificate. It is possible
deaths were incorrectly classified as hepatitis C­related
due to improper recording of causes of death on the death
certificate, mistakes in coding the death certificate data,
incorrect diagnosis of HCV infection, as well as errors
introduced by the case definition employed. Further-
more, HCV infection may have been under-ascertained
because its asymptomatic nature and long latent period
could lead to a failure of diagnosis among individuals in
whom it contributed substantially to death. Race and eth-
nicity are also sometimes misclassified on death certifi-
cates.24 This issue is compounded by errors in Census
Bureau population estimates due to Census undercounts
and unmet model assumptions for intercensal estimates
and postcensus projections.25 Errors in demographic in-
formation on both death certificates and population data
lead to distortions in rate estimates and may bias mortality
rate comparisons made between demographic groups.
Previous research by Wu et al. using capture-recapture
techniques with multiple-cause-of-death data and New
York State hospital discharge data support the hypothesis
that available data sources may substantially underesti-
mate the true number of hepatitis C­related deaths.26
Death certificates mentioning hepatitis C as either the
underlying cause of death or as a contributing cause of
death were compared to medical records with hepatitis C
listed as a discharge diagnosis, as a part of the patient's
history, or as a positive laboratory test. Using MCOD
data alone would have only captured 18% of the total
number of estimated deaths.26 Another study utilizing
Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program data for 2000
also found hepatitis C to be underreported on death cer-
tificates. Only 64% of deaths attributed to hepatitis C in
the Kaiser database listed hepatitis C as a cause of death on
the corresponding death certificate.27 Applying results of
these validation studies to data from 2004 suggests that
between 12,000 and 41,000 hepatitis C­related deaths
occurred, consistent with other published estimates.2
An important but infrequently recognized complexity
in the analysis of MCOD data pertains to the translation
of entity axis codes to record axis codes and may result in
an underestimation of cause-specific mortality. Although
HIV and hepatitis C are often both listed in the entity
axis, they are frequently combined into a single code for
HIV disease in the record axis. For example, it is possible
for ICD-10 codes K74.6 (other and unspecified cirrhosis
of liver), B24 (unspecified HIV disease), and B18.2
(chronic viral hepatitis C) to be listed separately in the
entity axis. After processing and translating the entity axis
codes, the record axis may only contain B20.3 (HIV dis-
ease resulting in other viral infections) and K74.6, with
B20.3 listed as the underlying cause of death. This phe-
nomenon could have lead to the exclusion of numerous
deaths strongly related to hepatitis C if ICD codes in the
entity axis had not been taken into account.
In summary, substantial increases in overall hepatitis
C­related mortality rates have occurred since 1995. De-
spite small declines in overall mortality in the last 2 years
of the study, rates have continued to increase among per-
sons aged 55-64 years. Currently, the vast majority of
mortality from hepatitis C­related disease is occurring in
persons under the age of 60 years, especially men. The
relatively young age of persons dying from hepatitis C­re-
lated liver disease has made hepatitis C­related disease a
leading infectious cause of years of potential life lost as
well as an important cause of premature mortality overall.
Despite recent declines in hepatitis C incidence, primary
prevention of new HCV infections will continue to be
important in limiting the future burden of chronic liver
disease mortality in the United States. These results also
