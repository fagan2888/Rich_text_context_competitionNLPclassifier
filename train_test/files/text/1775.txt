Objective: To provide levels of total and speciated urinary arsenic in a representative sample of the US population.
Methods: For the first time, total arsenic and seven inorganic and organic arsenic species were measured in the urine of participants (n ¼ 2557) for the
2003­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Data were compiled as geometric means and selected percentiles of urinary
arsenic concentrations (mg/l) and creatinine-corrected urinary arsenic (mg/g creatinine) for total arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid, arsenobetaine, and a sum of
the inorganic related species.
Results: Arsenic acid, arsenous acid, arsenocholine, and trimethylarsine oxide were detected in 7.6%, 4.6%, 1.8%, and 0.3% of the participants,
respectively (the limits of detection of 0.6­1.2 mg/l). Monomethylarsonic acid was detected in 35% of the overall population. For all participants aged Z6
years, dimethylarsinic acid (geometric mean of 3.71 mg/l) and arsenobetaine (geometric mean of 1.55 mg/l) had the greatest contribution to the total
urinary arsenic levels. A relatively greater percentage contribution from arsenobetaine is seen at higher total urinary arsenic levels and from
dimethylarsinic acid at lower total urinary arsenic levels. For all participants aged Z6 years, the 95th percentiles for total urinary arsenic and the sum of
inorganic-related arsenic (arsenic acid, arsenous acid, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid) were 65.4 and 18.9 mg/l, respectively. For total
arsenic and dimethylarsinic acid, covariate-adjusted geometric means demonstrated several slight differences due to age, gender, and race/ethnicity.
Conclusions: The data reflect relative background contributions of inorganic and seafood-related arsenic exposures in the US population. Arsenobetaine
and dimethylarsinic acid are the major arsenic species present with arsenobetaine, accounting for a greater proportion of total arsenic as total arsenic levels
increase.

Introduction
Arsenic is an element that is widely distributed in the earth's
surface in small amounts, primarily in its inorganic forms.
Anthropomorphic sources of arsenic have included the
smelting of mined metals. Inorganic arsenic is used currently
as an outdoor wood preservative, in some pesticides, as
semiconductor dopant materials, and in certain medicines.
General human exposure to inorganic arsenic results from
natural amounts consumed in drinking water. However,
dietary arsenic may be an important source (NRC, 2001)
when drinking water levels are low. Arsenic also forms
organic compounds through biological action on inorganic
arsenic. These organic forms are found in fish, shellfish,
seaweed, and aquatic sediments and are generally much less
toxic. These dietary arsenic species are commonly represented
by arsenobetaine and, to a lesser extent, by arsenocholine and
arsenosugars (Heinrich-Ramm et al., 2002). In addition to
the arsenical forms found in marine organisms, mono- and
dimethylated pentavalent and trivalent arsenicals are formed
from inorganic arsenic in mammals. Historically, this
metabolic pathway was viewed as a detoxification mechanism.
The trivalent methylated metabolites are believed to be highly
toxic and have been recently detected in human urine (Vahter,
2002; Cohen et al., 2006). Exposure to inorganic arsenic or
metabolites of inorganic arsenic, above typical environmental
levels, can result in a variety of adverse health effects, such as
skin disorders, neuropathy, and cancer of the lung, bladder,
and skin (NRC, 2001; WHO, 2001; ATSDR, 2007).
Urinary levels of arsenic are generally regarded as a good
measure of exposure (WHO, 2001). In this article, we
provide the first urinary arsenic data in a representative
sample of the US population reported in 2003­2004
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES). Total urinary arsenic was measured by
inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass
spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS), a technique that minimizes
or eliminates many argon-based polyatomic interferences

(Jarrett et al., 2007). Seven urinary inorganic and organic
forms of arsenic were measured separately by high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to
ICP-DRC-MS.
Methods
Study Design
NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). This survey is designed to assess the
health and nutrition status of the civilian, non-institutiona-
lized US population using a complex multistage probability
sample design as previously described (NCHS, 2008). For
NHANES 2003­2004, urine was collected for arsenic
measurements in a random one-third subset of persons aged
Z6 years representing the civilian, non-institutionalized
population of the United States by age, gender, and self-
reported race/ethnicity categories. Race/ethnicity categories
were non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
Americans. Remaining race/ethnic groups, although not
categorized separately, were included in total population
calculations. Age categories were children 6­11 years,
adolescents 12­19 years, and adults Z20 years. The survey
incorporates sample population weights to account for
the unequal selection probabilities caused by the cluster
design, non-response, and planned oversampling of certain
subgroups. The overall NHANES unweighted interview
response rate was 79%. Each subsample involves separate
sample weights. For analysis of subsample data, appropriate
subsample weights must be used.
Laboratory Methods
During the physical examinations, spot urine specimens were
collected in arsenic-free containers, stored at r41C, and then
shipped on dry ice to the CDC's National Center for
Environmental Health. Urine samples were stored frozen
(rÀ701C) and typically analyzed within 3 weeks of
collection. Total urinary arsenic concentrations are stable at
À701C for 43 years). Total urinary arsenic was analyzed
using ICP-DRC-MS (Jarrett et al., 2007). Briefly, 0.25 ml
urine was diluted with 2.25 ml of diluent (2% v/v nitric acid
and 10 mg/l gallium internal standard). Matrix-matched
calibrators were prepared by adding 0.1 ml of a calibration
standard into 0.9 ml of pooled urine (tested to be o5 mg/l
arsenic (As)) and 9 ml of diluent. Analysis was performed on
a ELANs DRCPlus or ELANs DRCt II ICP-MS
(PerkinElmer SCIEX, Concord, ON, Canada) equipped
with a Meinhard quartz nebulizer (Type TQ-30-A3), a DRC
quartz cyclonic spray chamber, a 2.0 mm ID quartz injector,
and nickel sampler and skimmer cones. Total urinary arsenic
was quantified based on the ratio of analyte to that of the
internal standard in peak hopping mode. Argon chloride
polyatomic interferences were eliminated by operating the
ICP-MS in DRC mode using 10% hydrogen in argon at a
flow rate of 0.2­0.6 s.c.c.m. (standard cubic centimeters
per minute) and a bandpass rejection parameter (RPQ) of
0.65­0.75. During urinalyses conducted for NHANES, we
analyzed two bench quality control pools along with blind
quality control pools interspersed among the participant
samples. The arsenic bench QC (n ¼ 272) had an interday
precision of 10.05% relative standard deviation (RSD) at
8.2 mg/l and RSD of 3.03% at 179.7 mg/l. The limit of
detection (LOD) for urinary arsenic was 0.74 mg/l. Accuracy
was verified by analyzing standard reference material (SRM
2670) from the National Institute of Standards Technology
(NIST) and reference materials from the Centre de
toxicologie du Que
´ bec (CTQ).
Seven arsenic species in urine were separated by HPLC
using an anion exchange column (PRP-X100s, 4.6 Â
150 mm, 5 mm, PEEK Hardware; Hamilton Company,
Reno, NV, USA) (Verdon et al., 2004). Urine was diluted
1:4 in 0.1 M ammonium acetate, pH 5, centrifuged at
10,000 g for 10 min, and then 20 ml of the supernatant was
injected onto the column. Arsenic species were eluted using a
linear gradient with a starting mobile phase of 10 mM
ammonium carbonate, 10 mM TRIS buffer, and pH 8.6 that
switched to 10 mM ammonium carbonate, 5 mM ammonium
sulfate, and pH 8 pumped at 1.0 ml/min. Column effluent
was directed to a Meinhard quartz nebulizer (Type TQ-30-
A3) in a quartz cyclonic spray chamber attached to an
ELAN DRC II ICP-MS (PerkinElmer SCIEX, Concord,
ON, Canada) that was equipped with a 2 mm ID quartz
injector, platinum sampler, and skimmer cones. The ICP-MS
was operated in DRC mode using 10% hydrogen in argon at
a flow rate of 0.2 s.c.c.m., RPQ of 0.4. 75As was monitored
in single ion mode as described previously (Jarrett et al.,
2007). Signal data were collected and analyzed using
TotalChromt chromatography data processing software
(PerkinElmer SCIEX) and Microsoft Excel 2003 (Microsoft
Corporation, Richmond, WA, USA). An electronically
activated six-port switching valve with a 200 ml sample loop
installed between the column and the ICP-MS was
programmatically switched to the inject position at 30 s after
the autosampler's sample injection. This introduced an
arsenic internal standard peak that appeared on the
chromatogram before the column void volume. Figure 1
illustrates a typical patient sample and one of our bench
quality control samples containing all seven arsenic species.
The integrated peak area ratios (analyte areas divided by
internal standard area) were used to calculate the concentra-
tion of each arsenic species against calibration curves
constructed using the human urine-based calibrators that
contained arsenocholine, arsenobetaine, trimethylarsine
oxide, dimethylarsinic acid, monomethylarsonic acid,
arsenic acid, and arsenous acid. The limits of detection were
as follows: arsenic acid 1.0 mg/l, arsenous acid 1.2 mg/l,

arsenobetaine 0.4 mg/l, arsenocholine 0.6 mg/l, dimethyl-
arsinic acid 1.7 mg/l, monomethylarsonic acid 0.9 mg/l,
and trimethylarsine oxide 1.0 mg/l. Quality control samples
consisting of previously characterized urine spiked with
known amounts of arsenic species were co-analyzed with
each run. The RSD for all bench QC (n ¼ 95) were o10%
for bi-level QC concentrations of each arsenic species in the
range from 4.9 to 22.1 mg/l.
We assessed arsenic contamination by screening all
reagents, collection containers, storage containers, and
sample vials and analyzed blanks with each batch of
unknowns. Reported results met the accuracy and precision
specification of the quality control/quality assurance program
of the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for
Environmental Health, CDC (similar to rules outlined by
Westgard et al., 1981).
Urinary creatinine concentrations were determined using
an automated colorimetric method on a Beckman Synchron
As/ASTR clinical analyzer (Beckman Instruments Inc, Brea,
CA, USA) at the Coulston Foundation (Alamogordo, NM,
USA) in 2003­2004 (CDC, 2004). Arsenic concentrations in
both the total and species methods were adjusted using
creatinine concentrations to correct for variable water
excretion rates at the time of spot urine specimen collection
(Barr et al., 2005).
Statistical Analysis
Urinary arsenic measurements were log-transformed prior to
data analysis. Geometric means and percentiles were
calculated using SUDAAN version 9.0 (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). Ninety-five
percent confidence limits (CI) for geometric means were
estimated based on the Taylor series linearization method
(SUDAAN user's manual, 2001) and CIs for percentiles
were adapted from the methods of Woodruff (1952) and
Korn and Graubard (1998). SUDAAN uses sample weights
and calculates variance estimates that account for the
complex survey design. Geometric means were computed
when 460% of the samples had detectable values. The LOD
divided by the square root of 2 was used for imputation of
values lower than the LOD. For each of total urinary arsenic
and dimethylarsinic acid, sufficient data were available for
comparing the covariate-adjusted geometric means of demo-
graphic groups by least squares multiple regression using the
covariates of age, gender, race/ethnicity, and urinary
creatinine. All two-way interactions were tested. Significant
differences were considered at an a ¼ 0.05. Arsenic concen-
trations in urine were also characterized into the following
three groups: o20, 20­49, and Z50 mg/l; medians and
confidence intervals were calculated.
Results
For total urinary arsenic, arsenobetaine, and dimethylarsinic
acid, Tables 1­3 present the geometric means and percentiles
in mg/l and Tables 4­6 present the data in mg/g of creatinine,
respectively. Arsenic acid, arsenous acid, arsenocholine, and
trimethylarsine oxide were detected in only 7.6%, 4.6%,
1.8% and 0.3% of the population, respectively (limits of
detection of 0.6­1.2 mg/l), therefore geometric means and
percentiles could not be calculated, except the 95th percentile
of urinary arsenic acid in participants aged 6 years and
older was 1.10 (95% CI: oLOD­1.20) mg/l or 3.04 (
oLOD­
3.50) mg/g of creatinine. Monomethylarsonic acid was
detected in 35% of the overall participants aged 6 years
and older; the 75th percentile was 1.2 (1.00­1.30) mg/l or
1.33 (1.18­1.54) mg/g creatinine, and 95th percentile was 2.4
(2.00­2.80) mg/l or 2.86 (2.40­3.33) mg/g creatinine, respec-
tively. Arsenobetaine and dimethylarsinic acid were the
major contributors to the total urinary arsenic level. For
subjects aged 6 years and older (n ¼ 2557), the geometric
mean levels of total urinary arsenic, arsenobetaine, and
dimethylarsinic acid were 8.3 (7.19­9.57), 1.55 (1.31­1.83),
and 3.71 (3.21­4.05) mg/l, respectively.
At higher percentiles, arsenobetaine levels appeared to
reflect a relatively larger proportion of the total urinary
arsenic than at lower percentiles. In a separate analysis

Levels of urinary total and speciated arsenic
Caldwell et al.
64 Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology (2009) 19(1)
categories of total urinary arsenic (
o20, 20­50, and 450mg/l)
was determined. Arsenobetaine, usually due to seafood
ingestion (Heinrich-Ramm et al., 2002), comprised a greater
portion of the total urinary arsenic as levels increased and
dimethylarsinic acid was the major contributor at lower levels
of total urinary arsenic.
Inorganic-related arsenic species (arsenic acid, arsenous
acid, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid)
were summed for each participant and percentiles were
computed. The 95th and 50th percentiles for all participants
aged Z6 years were 18.9 (15.8­22.9) mg/l and 6.0 (5.4­
6.1) mg/l, respectively, with dimethylarsinic acid accounting
for most of the inorganic sum. Owing to the high proportion
of non-detection for three of these arsenic species, the
influence of imputed values (below LOD) may slightly bias
the r50th percentiles. Table 8 gives the 95th and 50th
percentiles and confidence limits for the three age groups.
The covariate-adjusted geometric mean of total urinary
arsenic levels in the 12- to 19-year-old group (6.06 mg/l
(5.22­7.05)) was lower than either the 6- to 11-year-
old group (7.29 mg/l (CI 95%: 6.23­8.54), P ¼ 0.006) or
the Z20 years group (8.16 mg/l (7.11­9.37), Po0.001).
There was an interaction between race/ethnicity and gender.
The covariate-adjusted geometric mean of total urinary
arsenic levels in Mexican American males (9.67 mg/l (8.34­
11.2)) was higher than the mean in non-Hispanic white males
(7.52 mg/l (6.29­8.99), P ¼ 0.034), non-Hispanic black males
(7.79 mg/l (6.88­8.81), P ¼ 0.038), and Mexican American
females (8.21 mg/l (6.74­9.98), P ¼ 0.005). Non-Hispanic
black females (9.96 mg/l (7.87­12.6)) also had higher means
than did non-Hispanic black males (P ¼ 0.038). All other
possible comparisons were not significant.
The covariate-adjusted geometric mean of urinary di-
methylarsinic acid levels in the 12- to 19-year-old group
(2.99 mg/l (2.64­3.39)) was lower than that in either the 6- to
11-year-old group (3.68 mg/l (3.21­4.21), P ¼ 0.002) or Z20
year (3.58 mg/l (3.23­3.97), Po0.001) group. Mexican
American males had a higher geometric mean (4.46 mg/l
(4.04­5.15)) than did either non-Hispanic white males
(3.39 mg/l (2.99­3.85), P ¼ 0.004) or non-Hispanic black
males (3.52 mg/l (3.08­4.03), P ¼ 0.008). All other possible
comparisons were not significant.
Discussion
We report the total and speciated urinary arsenic levels
collected from a representative sample of 2557 US residents
aged Z6 years. Human exposure to inorganic arsenic occurs
predominately through drinking water and less frequently
from other sources, including contact from wood treated with
chromated copper arsenic preservatives and certain pesti-
cides. Dietary exposure to arsenic may be an important
source if drinking water levels are low. Exposure to organic
forms of arsenic primarily occurs from seafood. Measuring
total arsenic in human urine assesses the combined exposure
from all routes of exposure and all species of arsenic. The
individual species of arsenic measured in this study was the
common inorganic and organic forms; some rarer types
of arsenic, such as 3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenyarsonic acid
(a chicken feed additive, roxarsone), were not measurable
by our speciation method.
The levels of total urinary arsenic in the NHANES 2003­
2004 subsample were similar to the levels reported in
National Human Exposure Assessment Survey 1995­1996
(NHEXAS) for about 80 children residing in the Great
Lakes region (Pellizzari and Clayton, 2006). In the German
Environmental Survey III of 1998, median urinary total
arsenic levels in 4052 adults varied with seafood intake and
were approximately two-fold lower than those for NHANES
2003­2004 (Schulz et al., 2007). Higher mean or median

levels of total urinary arsenic than in NHANES 2003­2004
have been reported for people in western areas of North
America (Calderon et al., 1999; Meza et al., 2004; Valenzuela
et al., 2005; Josyula et al., 2006; Rubin et al., 2007), as well
as for other areas of the world (Ahsan et al., 2000; Aposhian
et al., 2000; Caceres et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2007), that were
known to have higher levels of arsenic in their drinking water.
Median and mean total urinary arsenic levels for residents in
some districts in Bangladesh have been reported to be about
50-fold higher than the respective levels in NHANES 2003­
2004 (Ahsan et al., 2000; Chowdhury et al., 2003) and
geometric mean levels were about 70-fold higher for residents
of Inner Mongolia, China (Sun et al., 2007). In the
NHANES 2003­2004 subsample, only small differences in
total urinary arsenic levels (and also dimethylarsinic acid)
were observed among the various demographic groups.
Whether these reflect differences in exposure or pharmaco-
kinetic factors is unknown.
Total urinary arsenic values can occasionally increase to
several thousands of mg/l after seafood ingestion. This is due
to the contribution of specific organic forms of arsenic
(arsenobetaine, arsenocholine, and trimethylarsine oxide)
found in seafood, which adds to the total urinary arsenic
measurement. Most arsenocholine and some trimethylarsine
oxide are converted to arsenobetaine in environmental
biosystems (NRC, 2001), so that the main seafood exposure
is from arsenobetaine; the NHANES 2003­2004 data show
little arsenocholine and trimethylarsine oxide in human urine
compared with arsenobetaine. After ingestion, organic forms
of arsenic are excreted quickly in the urine. Our analysis
shows that as total urinary arsenic levels increase from o20
to 20­50 mg/l and to 450 mg/l, the percentage of the total
urinary arsenic is increasingly due to arsenobetaine, with
median percentages being 62.7% for total urinary arsenic
levels 450 mg/l. The cut point of 50 mg/l was chosen because
some studies suggest that slight health risks may be associated
above this level (ACGIH, 2001; WHO, 2001; Tseng et al.,
2005; Valenzuela et al., 2005) and also because this value has
been used as an upper reference range. The cut point of
20 mg/l was chosen to correspond roughly to the 95th
percentile of the sum of inorganic species; thus, a urine
sample of o20 mg/l is likely to have little contribution from
organic arsenic species. Hence, the higher relative contribu-
tion from dimethylarsinic acid is found at lower levels
(median percent contribution from dimethylarsinic acid for a
urine sample of o20 mg/l is 53.4%).
In NHANES 2003­2004 and most human studies,
dimethylarsinic acid is the predominant metabolite compos-
ing the majority of measurable inorganic-related arsenic in
the urine. Levels of dimethylarsinic and monomethylarsonic
acids will increase in approximate proportion to the intake of
inorganic arsenic. In the late 1980s, a control population of
696 Tacoma residents demonstrated a median urinary
dimethylarsinic acid level similar to those reported in
NHANES 2003­2004 (Kalman et al., 1990). In the residents
of a Chilean town who consumed water with high levels of
inorganic arsenic, median levels of urinary dimethylarsinic
acid were about 40-fold higher than the adult median levels
in NHANES 2003­2004, and urinary dimethylarsinic
acid represented about 67% of the total urinary arsenic
(Hopenhayn-Rich et al., 1996). The levels of monomethyl-
arsonic acid reported in NHANES 20003­2004 were
characterized only at the upper percentiles and, as with
dimethylarsinic acid, these levels were much lower than those
found in other studies where environmental exposures were
highly elevated (Chowdhury et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2007).
Because arsenic acid, arsenous acid, arsenocholine, and
trimethylarsine oxide were detected in only 7.6%, 4.6%,
1.8% and 0.3%, respectively, of specimens, each species
made only a small contribution to the total urinary arsenic
level. Arsenic acid and arsenous acid are often the primary
forms of arsenic to which people are exposed to in drinking
water; however, these are metabolized in the body with
arsenic acid being reduced to arsenous acid and then
methylated to monomethylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acids
(WHO, 2001). The sum of the inorganic-related species
provided estimates at the 95th percentiles; this level is an
important upper benchmark for the US population because
the sum of these species represents a dose of the more toxic
inorganic arsenic most likely incurred from drinking water.
Also, in recent years, occupational monitoring and research
studies have focused on the sum of inorganic-related species
as a measure of inorganic arsenic intake. Studies of small
groups of metal smelter and sulfuric acid workers with
varying industrial hygiene conditions have reported urinary
inorganic arsenic levels ranging up to several hundreds of mg/l
during or after work exposure (Vahter et al., 1986; Offergelt
et al., 1992; Jakubowski et al., 1998; WHO, 2001). Timber
treatment workers had median urinary dimethylarsinic acid
levels (a surrogate marker for inorganic arsenic exposure)
that were about 15-fold higher than adult median levels
reported elsewhere (Morton and Mason, 2006). The
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists
(ACGIH) provided an occupational biologic effect index
(BEI) for urinary inorganic arsenic plus metabolites of
35 mg/l (ACGIH, 2001). The 95th percentile of the
NHANES 2003­2004 subsample for the sum of inorganic-
related species was 18.9 mg/l, which is below the ACGIH
BEI. Also, about 95% of the adult US population is likely to
be below the US Environmental Protection Agency reference
dose (USEPA, 2001) for inorganic arsenic intake (0.3 mg/kg/
day), if 18.9 mg is considered an approximated daily expo-
sure (assuming 1 l of urine is produced per day by a 70 kg
person, steady-state conditions, and all ingested arsenic
appears in the urine), then 18.9 mg/70 kg ¼ 0.27 mg/kg/day.
CDC began monitoring urinary arsenic in the US population
starting with the NHANES 2003­2004 survey and will
collect future survey data. This may allow assessment of the

Conclusion
The data reflect relative background contributions of
inorganic and seafood-related arsenic exposures in the US
population. Arsenobetaine and dimethylarsinic acid are the
major arsenic species present with arsenobetaine accounting
for a greater proportion of total arsenic as total arsenic levels
increase.
