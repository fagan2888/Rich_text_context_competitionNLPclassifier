Street Stops and Police Legitimacy:
Teachable Moments in Young Urban
Men's Legal Socialization
Tom R. Tyler, Jeffrey Fagan, and Amanda Geller*
An examination of the influence of street stops on the legal socialization of young men
showed an association between the number of police stops they see or experience and a
diminished sense of police legitimacy. This association was not primarily a consequence of
the number of stops or of the degree of police intrusion during those stops. Rather, the
impact of involuntary contact with the police was mediated by evaluations of the fairness of
police actions and judgments about whether the police were acting lawfully. Whether the
police were viewed as exercising their authority fairly and lawfully shaped the impact of stops
on respondents' general judgments about police legitimacy. Fairness and lawfulness judg-
ments, in turn, were influenced by the number of stops and the degree of police intrusion
during those stops. Similarly, judgments of justice and lawfulness shaped the estimated
influence of judgments of the general character of police behavior in the community on
general perceptions of police legitimacy. These results suggest that the widespread use of
street stops undermined legitimacy. Lowered legitimacy had an influence on both law
abidingness and the willingness to cooperate with legal authorities. The findings show that
people were influenced by perceptions of police injustice/illegality.
I. Introduction
Legal scholars recognize the centrality of the issue of legal culture (i.e., the "network of
values and attitudes relating to law") (Friedman 1975:34) to the functioning of legal

authorities. In particular, they have been concerned about how Americans acquire views
about the legitimacy of law and legal authority (Sarat 1977). People do so through a process
that includes childhood socialization (Tapp & Levine 1977) and later personal and peer
experiences with legal authorities. In particular, the period of adolescence and young
adulthood is often viewed as key since young men have their most frequent experiences
with legal authorities, as do their peers, during this period (Brunson & Weitzer 2011; Fagan
& Tyler 2005). The most frequent legal authority young people encounter is a police officer
(Tyler & Huo 2002). The goal of this study is to explore the impact on legitimacy of a
particularly salient type of young adult experience with the police--the car or street
stop--during a particularly central developmental period--young adulthood.
Being questioned by the police is a common occurrence in New York City for
hundreds of thousands of residents and visitors, but particularly for young men of color
(Fagan 2010, 2013; Fagan et al. 2010, 2012). Over the past 20 years, the New York Police
Department has engaged in a series of controversial policies and practices in its dealings
with the public. These have included zero-tolerance arrests for minor infractions and
violations (Geller & Fagan 2010; Greene 1999; Zimring 2011), saturation of nonwhite
neighborhoods with aggressive stop and frisk tactics (Fagan et al. 2010; Schulhofer et al.
2011), frequent car stops, and surveillance of suspect groups such as Muslims in their
places of worship and other gathering spots (Huq et al. 2011; Powell 2012; Ruderman
2012a; Tyler et al. 2010). Many stops and frisks result from enforcement of trespass and
other quality-of-life laws in both public and private housing. In many instances, citizens
are either stopped or arrested on suspicion of criminal trespass while attempting to
enter their own home or to visit family members in those buildings (Davis v. City of
New York 2010; Ligon v. City of New York 2012; Carlis 2009; Fagan et al. 2012;
Toobin 2013).
Trespass enforcement is only one dimension of a larger policy of proactive policing
in New York and many other cities (Kubrin et al. 2010). Proactive policing emphasizes the
engagement of police with potential criminal offenders or situations based on any of several
indicia that crime may be imminent or in process. In New York, those policies have
produced more than 4.4 million involuntary contacts between the police and members of
the public between 2004 and 2012 (NYPD various years). Of these contacts, about one in
nine resulted in an arrest or a citation, and about one in five appear to fall short of
constitutional grounds of legal sufficiency (Fagan 2013). Almost none turn up guns (0.11
percent of all stops) or other contraband (1.5 percent). The high rate of error in these
stops, both constitutionally and in effectiveness, is a potential sore spot that could poison
citizen support for and cooperation with the police.
Each of these police-citizen contacts is potentially a "teachable moment" about
policing for both citizens and police. Yet both legal and policy debates about proactive
policing sidestep these lessons and focus instead on two broader frameworks: legality and
effectiveness (Harcourt & Meares 2011; Stuntz 2011; Amar 1998). Legality draws on the
constitutional framework set forth in Terry v. Ohio (1968): that "crime is afoot." That
standard refers to crimes that either have just taken place, are imminent, or are ongoing.
Terry defines the conditions when police may approach and temporarily detain a citizen
based on the officer's reasonable suspicion that "crime is afoot" (Alschuler 2002; Harcourt
752 Tyler et al.
& Meares 2011). The legality standard asks whether the police have acted on the permis-
sible grounds of stopping people when there is reasonable suspicion.
Effectiveness is a policy concern, defined in terms of impact of these policies and
practices in identifying those whose behavior may signal that they are intending to commit
serious crime, or that they may have just completed a crime (Kubrin et al. 2010). The
standard inquiry in this type of evaluation is whether stops turn up active offenders or those
being sought by the police or the seizure of contraband (Knowles et al. 2001; Persico 2009;
Richardson 2010).
But neither the constitutional nor policy standards address appropriate police conduct
when dealing with persons who have fallen under the police gaze of suspicion. Neither of
these standards or benchmarks addresses how police should go about conducting a field
interrogation or search of a suspect; they only address the conditions that can initiate the
contact and the factors that can justify increasing intrusiveness during the course of the
interrogation. There is some "teaching" value in how these formal legal standards shape
police behavior and some instructional value for citizens in learning the boundaries of their
privacy protections under the Fourth Amendment, but these lessons suggest a narrow
concept of legal socialization. At best, these become abstract civics lessons detached from
the salience of the moment and the emotional freight that these interactions carry. Our
rationale for this article is, quite simply, that we object to the dryness of this version of the
civics lesson about police power.
The "teachable moments" from the millions of routine encounters each year under
proactive policing regimes across the country are hardly abstract civics lessons that are
confined to assessments of legality or crime control. Recent research on the police suggests
an additional criterion that might be applied to the evaluation of police policies and
practices: how the activities of the police shape public views about police legitimacy. These
activities create general and salient impressions about how the police exercise their author-
ity and, in turn, about police legitimacy, even among those not stopped (Carr et al. 2007;
Sunshine & Tyler 2003; Tyler 2006b; Tyler & Fagan 2008; Weitzer & Tuch 2006).
Legitimacy has become a focus of concern in recent years because popular legitimacy
increasingly has been linked to citizen behaviors that are important to the success of
policing (Schulhofer et al. 2011). Those behaviors include deference to police authority
during personal interactions (Tyler & Huo 2002); acceptance of police authority as an
alternative to private violence or collective disorder (Jackson et al. 2013); heightened
compliance with the law (Jackson et al. 2012a; Tyler 2006a); and increased willingness to
cooperate with the police (Jackson et al. 2012b; Sunshine & Tyler 2003; Tyler & Fagan 2008;
Tyler 2009, 2011).
Accordingly, research on the role of legitimacy in law-related behaviors suggests a
not-so-hidden cost to the long-term success of policing efforts if the policies and practices
of the police undermine their popular legitimacy. Past studies have shown that compro-
mised perceptions of police legitimacy may be internalized to influence both cooperation
with the police and compliance with the law (Tyler & Fagan 2008; Fagan & Piquero 2007;
Jackson et al. 2012a). Effects of policing on legitimacy, cooperation, and legal compliance
have been identified in both offender (Fagan & Piquero 2007) and general population
(Tyler & Fagan 2008; Fagan & Tyler 2005) samples. The results of this research thus far
Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 753
confirm that the consequences of legitimacy may go well beyond the concerns of the
individuals affected to influence public safety.
In this article, we examine these dimensions of police-citizen contacts in two impor-
tant contexts for theory and policy. First, the study site is New York City, a place where
intensive proactive policing has been institutionalized into the strategic design of policing
and has become an intimate and deep-rooted part of the social ecology of many neighbor-
hoods (Beckett et al. 2005, 2006; Fagan et al. 2010, 2012; Fagan 2010, 2012). Second, the
study sample is young males between the ages of 18­26. This population makes up about
half the 4.4 million involuntary police stops in New York from 2004­2012. This also is the
population with the highest crime rates, particularly violent crimes that attract police
attention and that drive public policy. The concentration of crime and policing in this
population, and in the poorest and highest crime neighborhoods of the city, provides
a rich context for identifying the influence of policing on legitimacy and its law-related
consequences.
A. Legitimacy and Law-Related Behavior
What is legitimacy? In the Weberian view (1978), legitimacy is based on beliefs that legal
authorities have the right to dictate appropriate behavior. As a consequence, members of
the public internalize an obligation and responsibility to follow the law and obey the
decisions of legal authorities. Although definitions of legitimacy vary widely, a key feature
of many is that it confers the right to command and to dictate behavior, and that it
promotes the corresponding duty to obey (Tyler 2006a). Modern discussions of legitimacy
are usually traced to the writings of Weber (1968) on authority and the social dynamics of
authority. Weber, like Machiavelli and others before him, argued that successful authorities
and institutions use more than brute force to execute their directives. They also strive to
win the consent of the governed so that their commands will be voluntarily obeyed
(Tyler 2006a).
Others suggest that legitimacy of legal authorities is earned, if not negotiated,
through actions that demonstrate its moral grounding. In this view, legitimacy is imparted
to legal institutions (or other institutions with power over subordinates) when there is
moral alignment between those with power and their subordinates. Legitimacy in this
framework is the right to rule, and this right is earned in part by what Beetham (1991:11)
calls "the degree of congruence, or lack of it, between a given system of power and the
beliefs, values and expectations that provide its justification." Legitimacy is not a given
power, but accumulates through dense social interactions with authorities, where accounts
and evaluations of experiences with the police are shared through efficient information
markets and social networks. There also is an implicit emotional component to this view,
suggesting that legitimacy is the product of salient gratifying interactions and, alternately,
that it can be corroded through negative interactions. Neutrality in interactions produces
little more than more neutrality, and suggests a situational and transient tie between the
powerful and subordinates.
Kelman and Hamilton (1995) argue that legitimacy "authorizes" a legal actor to
determine appropriate behavior within a specific situation; the citizen then feels obligated
754 Tyler et al.
to follow the directives or rules that authority establishes. Kelman and Hamilton go on to
claim that the authorization of actions by authorities "seem[s] to carry automatic justifica-
tion for them. Behaviorally, authorization obviates the necessity of making judgments or
choices. Not only do normal moral principles become inoperative, but--particularly when
the actions are explicitly ordered--a different type of morality, linked to the duty to obey
superior orders, tends to take over" (Kelman & Hamilton 1989:16). Legitimacy, according
to this general view, is a quality that is inherently possessed by an authority, law, or
institution that leads others to feel obligated to accept its directives. It is "a quality attributed
to a regime by a population" (Merelman 1966:548). Consistent with the arguments of
Weber, the suggestion is that perceptions of legitimacy are based on feelings of obligation
that are disconnected from substance and material interest. Legitimacy is linked not to the
authorities' possession of instruments of reward or coercion, but to properties of the
authority that lead people to feel it is entitled to make decisions and be obeyed. People will
abide by the law and follow police directives even if they disagree with specific guidelines
and instructions.
In this study, we operationalize these dimensions of legitimacy using the three
elements that have been central to these theories and to past empirical assessments (Tyler
& Jackson 2014): (1) trust and confidence in the police; (2) the perceived obligation to
obey; and (3) the judgment that the police and the public are in normative alignment
concerning values.
B. Terry Stops and Proactive Policing in New York
Adolescents and young adults have uniquely high rates of contact with police, much of it
involuntary (Langton & Durose 2013; Fagan et al. 2010: Ayres & Borowsky 2008). For many
youths, during pivotal developmental stages when adolescents form lasting views of the
legitimacy of legal norms and legal actors, the police are the primary face of the state and
the first that they are likely to encounter growing up (Fagan & Tyler 2005; Skogan & Frydl
2004). The growing policy preference for proactive policing over the past two decades
has increased the likelihood of police encounters and changed the nature of police-youth
contact (Kubrin et al. 2010). In "proactive policing," officers actively engage citizens in
attempts to detect criminal activity that crime is imminent, ongoing, or recently completed
(Harmon 2009; Skogan & Frydl 2004). These temporary street or car detentions are
constitutionally sanctioned and regulated under Terry v. Ohio (1968). Under Terry, police
are required to have reasonable and articulable suspicion that "crime is afoot" to justify the
temporary detention and questioning of a citizen. A series of subsequent cases (e.g., Whren
v. United States 1996; Illinois v. Wardlow 2000; People v. DeBour 1976) have further defined the
scope and nature of when police can make "proactive" stops (Harcourt & Meares 2011;
Alschuler 2002). In addition to street activity, police both in cities and suburbs have become
ubiquitous in schools, often with the authority to make arrests or physical detentions, and
engage in other enforcement activity such as locker or backpack searches (Kupchik 2010).
Although data limitations complicate comparisons across cities, it seems that
nowhere in the United States is this practice more prevalent than in New York City (Zimring
2011; Fagan & MacDonald 2013). Police in New York made over 4.5 million proactive stops
Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 755
from 2004­2012, and nearly half those (48.5 percent) are stops of persons ages 16­24
(Fagan 2013). Among youths 13­15, police in New York recorded 206,000 stops during the
same period (Geller 2013).1 Fagan et al. (2010) estimated that approximately 80 percent of
African-American adolescents ages 16­17 were stopped one or more times by New York City
police in 2006. Comparable rates for Hispanics were 38 percent and 10 percent for white
youths.
The low yield in crime detection from these stops (Fagan 2010, 2013) raises ques-
tions about the accuracy of the suspicion animating these stops. The stop regime seems
closer to an administrative or actuarial design rather than the highly articulated require-
ments for individualized and "reasonable" suspicion envisioned by Terry and also required
in New York law (People v. DeBour 1976). In many cities, these police-citizen interactions
are unlikely to result in arrest, summons, or the seizure of contraband (Alpert et al. 2005;
Bailey v. City of Philadelphia 2011; Fagan et al. 2010); rates of return (commonly known as
"hit rates") in some cities have the potential to fall below those of randomized check-
points (City of Indianapolis v. Edmond 2000; Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz 1990).
Furthermore, the burden of involuntary police contact in many large cities falls on black
and Latino residents, at times to the extent that efficiency is compromised (Alpert et al.
2005; Epp et al. in press; Fagan 2010; Geller & Fagan 2010; Hagan et al. 2005; Thompson
1999; Banks 2003), raising equity and constitutional concerns about the possibility of
racial profiling.
Although rates of stops of adolescents and young adults are quite high in New York,
the rates are also high across the country. Evidence from the National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth suggests that more than 15 percent of American youth have been arrested by age
18, with higher rates for African Americans (30 percent) (Brame et al. 2012). By age 23, 30
percent of all males have been arrested one or more times, with higher rates (47 percent) for
African-American males. The 2008 Police-Public Contact Survey suggests that 13.2 percent
of U.S. residents aged 16 and 17 had face-to-face contact with a police officer (Eith &
Durose 2011). In a survey of more than 18,000 Chicago public school students, about half
reported that they had been stopped and asked questions by the police, and "told off or told
to move on" by the time they were in ninth or tenth grade (Hagan et al. 2005).
Beyond policy and constitutional concerns, unwanted stops also risk emotional and
psychological harms (Geller et al. in press). Despite the low sanction or seizure rates, these
stops have the potential to be physically invasive and psychologically distressing. Qualitative
research both in New York City and elsewhere suggests that young men are often hand-
cuffed, thrown to the ground, or slammed against walls while their bodies and belongings
are searched (Brunson & Weitzer 2009; Rios 2011; Powell 2012; Ruderman 2012a, 2012b).
Force is significantly more likely to be used against minority suspects in street stop encoun-
ters than against whites (Fagan 2010), compounding the assaults on dignity by including a
dimension of racial targeting for the most extreme forms of police contact. In interviews,
1Since the age of majority for criminal responsibility in New York is 16, police are dis-incentivized from recording
stops of persons who are legal minors. There are limitations on the field interrogations of minors that may serve as
barriers to proactive policing of youths. Accordingly, the estimate of the number of persons below 16 years of age who
are stopped in New York City is likely a conservative figure. See, e.g., Fratello et al. (2013) and Stoudt et al. (2011).
756 Tyler et al.
both young men and women report that street stops are laced with violence, threats,
hypermasculine and homophobic invective, and degrading and racially tinged language
(Brunson & Weitzer 2009; Gau & Brunson 2010; Rios 2011). Some young women stopped
by the police report feelings of embarrassment and sexual intimidation when stopped,
particularly when they are frisked by male officers (Ruderman 2012b).
C. Policing and Legal Socialization
These personal experiences with the police also are key determinant of legal socialization,
a process that unfolds during childhood and adolescence to shape the likelihood of youth
compliance with the law and cooperation with legal actors (Fagan & Tyler 2005; Fagan &
Piquero 2007; Hagan et al. 2005). Shedd (2012) suggests high rates of distress and percep-
tions of injustice among Chicago youth who have been stopped by the police, while
Brunson and Weitzer (2009) identify feelings of "hopelessness" and being "dehumanized."
Adolescent legal socialization might also be influenced by police activity that teens witness
in their neighborhoods, even if they are not personally stopped. Rosenbaum et al. (2005),
Gau and Brunson (2010), and Brunson and Weitzer (2009) identify a "vicarious" experi-
ence of policing, in which perceptions of the police are influenced not only by one's own
experiences, but also by the experiences of others.
In this study, we locate legitimacy and the experiences that shape its formation as a
process of legal socialization. We define legal socialization as the developmental process by
which individuals internalize the norms of the law through their direct and vicarious
interactions with law and legal actors (Fagan & Tyler 2005). Legal socialization is the
internalization of law, rules, and agreements among members of society, and the legitimacy
of authority to deal fairly with citizens who violate society's rules. What adolescents see and
experience through interactions with police, courts, and other legal actors shapes their
perceptions of the relation between individuals and society. When experiences with legal
actors are perceived as fair, just, and proportionate, these experiences reinforce the legiti-
macy of the law, and can contribute to compliance and desistance. However, when pun-
ishment is delivered unfairly, unjustly, and/or disproportionately, it leads to cynicism about
the law, and can contribute to anger and persistence of criminal behavior (Sampson &
Bartusch 1998; Kirk & Papachristos 2011; Papachristos et al. 2012).
Our concern here is the criminal law, and the relevant law-related behaviors that may
be affected by this domain of legal socialization. A person's willingness to support law and
law enforcement is a litmus test of the effectiveness and viability of the efforts of the police
to manage social order (Tyler 2006a), and while that support can be secured and leveraged
by the threat of coercion and/or the promise of reward, it is easier in a democratic and
pluralist society to exercise authority through legitimacy, that is, by acting in ways that
people find appropriate, reasonable, and just. In this view, legitimacy is a product of how
police treat people and make decisions when they are exercising their regulatory authority
(Tyler & Fagan 2008). Police behavior toward citizens confers a status of democratic
belonging and social identity that has important consequences for cooperation between
citizens and legal authorities (Bradford 2014).
Even legally trivial and inconsequential interactions in which a person is not detained
or arrested--the vast majority of police-citizen encounters in New York--can have a strong
Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 757
influence on people's views about the legitimacy of the police. So, too, can vicarious
experiences: witnessing other people's interactions with the law and legal authorities. This
perspective suggests that we should treat each encounter between citizens and the police
(as well as courts and other legal actors) as a socializing experience--a teachable
moment--that builds or undermines legitimacy.
The link between procedural fairness and legitimacy is in turn essential to public
safety since citizens' views about police legitimacy predict compliance with legal rules and
cooperation with the police (Tyler 2006a). Procedural fairness affects citizens' cooperation
with police and their participation in the co-production of security. Reporting crimes to the
police, assisting police in the identification of criminals, and participation in crime-
prevention efforts are all expressions of cooperation that are strongly influenced by legiti-
macy and its predicate of procedural fairness. In other words, police success in fighting
crime depends on having public cooperation, which in turn depends on perceptions of
police legitimacy.
Being stopped by the police has been shown to have both positive and negative
implications for legal socialization, depending on the nature of the interactions that
citizens have with the police in the course of an encounter. Research with community
samples of New York City residents (Tyler & Fagan 2008) and young people in London
(Bradford 2014) finds that legal socialization is shaped not only by whether respondents
had been stopped by the police, but also by their perceptions of procedural justice during
the stop: whether they felt they were stopped for a legitimate reason, treated fairly, and
given an opportunity to tell their side of the story, or whether decisions were made via just
procedures. Perceived procedural justice varied widely across respondents, and was found
to be a stronger determinant of perceived police legitimacy than whether the respondent
received a favorable outcome. Fagan and Piquero (2007) found much the same with a
sample of active offenders ages 16­21 from two large cities.
On the other hand, a strong and proactive police presence also has the potential to
promote adolescent well-being, positive feelings about the police, and a sense of security
among urban residents through fair and just practices and improvements to public safety
(Powell 2012; Sunshine & Tyler 2003; Tyler & Huo 2002). While these benefits may accrue
predominantly to those not personally stopped by the police, youth may also benefit from
contact with the police, particularly if these interactions divert them from risky activities or
encourage respectful relationship building within their community (Skogan et al. 2008).2
What remains unknown is how these practices affect legal socialization and law-
related behaviors among a general population of older adolescents and young adults, those
who are both most likely to have involuntary contacts with the police, and those who are at
the highest risk ages for the commission of crimes. Although these policy changes have
exposed tens of thousands of urban youth to involuntary and frequently aggressive contact
with the police, much remains to be learned about teens' experiences of these interactions,
2In Chicago, for example, Operation CeaseFire sought to divert high-risk youth from gun violence and victimization
through intensive community outreach, including connecting the youth to employment opportunities and "safe
havens" in their communities. Nearly all CeaseFire "clients" interviewed reported that the program had a positive
impact on their lives. See Skogan et al. (2008).

how these experiences vary across neighborhood and other social contexts, or the impli-
cations of police contact for adolescent health, attitudes, or subsequent compliance with
the law. This project addresses that question using the intensive proactive policing regime
in New York City as the research setting.
D. The Present Study
This study addresses several questions to elaborate on the relationship between policing,
legitimacy, and law-related behaviors. We ask these questions in a research setting--New
York City--where street stop tactics saturate many neighborhoods and where, in turn,
young men are frequently and intensively exposed to a policing regime (Fratello et al. 2013;
Stoudt et al. 2011/12; Fagan et al. 2010). Our first question is whether legitimacy influences
respondents' law-related behavior. The premise of this analysis, as in previous studies (Tyler
2006b), is that legitimacy is important because it shapes how people act in relationship to
the law. Here, we test this premise by looking at the relationship between legitimacy and
three important potential or ongoing behaviors: recent violent/criminal behavior; willing-
ness to cooperate with the police by reporting crime and criminals; and willingness to
cooperate with the legal system by serving on a jury.
The argument that legitimacy shapes law-related behavior is not a new one. A number
of prior studies have suggested that legitimacy influences compliance with the law (Jackson
et al. 2012a; Tyler 2006a), as well as the willingness to accept the decisions made by legal
authorities (Tyler & Huo 2002). More recently, research has suggested that legitimacy also
influences the willingness to cooperate with legal authorities, including police officers and
judges (Sunshine & Tyler 2003; Tyler & Fagan 2008). Hence, it was anticipated that
legitimacy would influence law-related behavior, a hypothesis we test below.
The second question is whether street/car stops influence legitimacy. This question
was addressed both by looking at the number of street stops that people have experienced
and the degree to which the stops involved more intense intrusions by the police into
respondents' lives and liberty. This analysis addressed the question of whether street stops
undermine or promote legitimacy.
Considerable anecdotal evidence suggests that when street stops are conducted in a
way that is unfair or harsh, they may undermine police legitimacy (Powell 2012; Ruderman
2012a, 2012b; Brunson & Weitzer 2009; Rios 2011). However, this argument is largely based
on qualitative studies using interviews with young men (Collins 2007; Delgado 2008; Howell
2009; Lyons 2002) or observations of citizen reactions to police stops (Gould & Mastrofski
2004). Those studies provide anecdotal evidence of anger and alienation resulting from
involuntary contacts with the police, evidence echoed in many press accounts of police
stops. Other studies, net of evaluations of police treatment of citizens, suggest more
widespread public acceptance of street stops (e.g., Boydstun 1975).
Accordingly, the third question involves an analysis of the role of psychological
judgments about the justice or injustice of police actions during stops in shaping reactions
to the police. A large literature links people's reactions to personal experiences with the
police and general judgments about police behavior to evaluations of the procedural justice
of police actions (Belvedere et al. 2005; Bradford et al. 2009; Gau & Brunson 2009; Hinds
Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 759
2009; Tyler & Huo 2002). This literature leads to the hypothesis that it is not stops per se
that undermine legitimacy, but the behavior of the police during those stops (Tyler &
Wakslak 2004).
A contrasting view of street stops focuses on their perceived legality. Police officers, of
course, receive extensive training in the law and the meaning of "reasonable suspicion."
However, their view may or may not correspond to those of the public (Meares et al. in
press). Further, the police themselves may or may not be following these rules (Gould &
Mastrofski 2004). The issue addressed here is whether public views about whether police
stops are made using appropriate criterion shape the impact of those stops on legitimacy.
If the fairness of police behavior shapes reactions to stops, the question arises of
whether the police could engage in frequent stops if they treated people fairly. A further
analysis explores the impact of frequent stops on judgments about stop fairness and legality.
It explores whether multiple stops lead people to view the actions of the police differently,
in particular viewing them as less just and legal.
Finally, the analysis directly tests the underlying argument that stops undermine
behavior by examining the influence of legitimacy on three key variables: criminal activity;
cooperation with the police; and cooperation with the courts. It is because legitimacy shapes
behavior that the potential undermining effects of stops on legitimacy need to be examined.
It is the argument that stops lower legitimacy and as a consequence raise levels of criminal
behavior that more directly counters the suggestion that stops improve public safety.
The goal of this analysis is to examine the impact of street stops on the attitudes and
behavior of the members of the public who are most likely to experience being stopped in
the course of everyday proactive policing--young males in dense urban areas--in a
setting--New York City--where these tactics saturate many neighborhoods.
II. Methods
A. Samples and Procedures
A stratified random sample of young men ages 18­26 in New York City was interviewed by
telephone about their history of contact with the NYPD both in their lifetime and in the past
year. The study separately assessed respondents' evaluations of stops in the neighborhood
more generally. Subjects were randomly sampled from 146 "neighborhood clusters." Clus-
ters were defined from 295 "neighborhoods" developed by the NYC Department of City
Planning in the 1990s for detailed exploration of social and economic life within socially
homogenous neighborhood boundaries.3 Neighborhoods were clustered to optimize and
make consistent their size, geographic proximity, and socioeconomic homogeneity. In
some instances, populous and spatially large neighborhoods were split to create two smaller
units. Each neighborhood cluster had populations ranging from 7,358 to 215,753, with an
interquartile range of 28,716 to 70,921.

Neighborhoods were then stratified by their per-capita rates of police stops in the past
24 months and sorted into deciles. Forty neighborhoods were selected, with oversamples
of neighborhoods in the deciles with the highest stop rates. Initial selection included
eight randomly selected neighborhoods from each of the top three deciles (D8­D10), four
neighborhoods from each of D5­D7, and one neighborhood from each of D1­D4. The
oversample of high-stop neighborhoods was intended to generate a sample of respondents
with greater exposure to stop activity, and greater statistical power to detect the effects of
having been stopped.
Randomization was broken by selecting the Lower East Side in order to provide
geographic diversity and because interviewing was suspended in one cluster following
Superstorm Sandy on October 31, 2012.4 Elsewhere, in adjacent neighborhoods with
low response rates, smaller neighborhoods were combined, yielding a final sample of 37
neighborhoods.
Within each neighborhood, phone numbers were randomly selected from three
sampling frames: landline random digit dial (RDD), cell phone RDD, and a listed sample
obtained from a market research agency. Analyses of characteristics of landline and cell
phone respondents and the extent of their interactions with police showed few differences
in the method of recruitment. Although numbers from the listed sample were more likely
to appear in our sample, and were also eligible to be selected from the RDD samples, the
listed sample was "de-duplicated" from the RDD sample and, accordingly, could be treated
as a special stratum within the landline RDD sample. Every landline phone number in New
York City therefore had a known probability of selection. The sample was also adjusted to
note "dual-service" households with both landlines and cell phones (who could have been
selected from either frame).
Samples of a minimum of 25 respondents were recruited within each neighborhood
cluster. Interviews were conducted by telephone. The neighborhood location of each
respondent's residence was recorded to analyze persons within neighborhoods. The final
sample of 1,261was weighted to approximate a random sample of the young men in New
York City who were exposed to stop and frisk policing. The sample weights were also
adjusted for within-household selection, for the rare cases that households contained
multiple members in our population of interest (i.e., 18­26 year old males), and differential
nonresponse by race/ethnicity, borough, and telephone service. Finally, the distribution of
the weights was examined for extreme values, truncated at the 97.5th percentile (to
improve the precision of survey estimates), and scaled to sum to the total sample size.

1. Dependent Variables
Three dependent variables were assessed: legitimacy; recent criminal activity; and coopera-
tion with the police and the courts.
a. Legitimacy. The legitimacy scale reflected three aspects of the concept of legitimacy: trust
and confidence; obligation to obey; and shared normative values. The items reflecting these
concepts were averaged and given equal weight to create an overall scale.
b. Recent Criminal Activity. Self-report was used was to measure recent criminal activity, a
methodology supported by comparisons of self-report to other methods for determining
frequency of criminal activity (Hindelang et al. 1981; Thornberry & Krohn 2000; Peppers &
Petrie 2003; Lauritsen 1998; Piquero et al. 2014).
c. Cooperation. Two dimensions of cooperation were assessed to examine specific domains
of cooperation and to identify unique effects on policing: cooperation with the police and
participation in legal processes. Cooperation included reporting crimes and cooperating as
a witness in investigations. Legal processes included serving on a jury.

2. Background Factors
Respondents were asked to report their race and ethnicity, their age, the highest level of
education attained, and their prior criminal history. For long-term criminal history,
respondents were asked (yes/no): "Have you ever": "been arrested" (28 percent said yes);
"received a summons for a criminal violation or a desk appearance ticket" (DAT) (27
percent said yes); "spent time in jail" (13 percent said yes); "been on probation" (11 percent
said yes); and "served time in prison" (3 percent said yes).
3. Generalized Neighborhood Experience with Police
Respondents were asked to describe two features of police stop activity in their neigh-
borhood. These judgments about police activity were made on a scale ranging from
"frequently" (1) to "never" (5). Respondents were asked: "How often do the police" engage
in various behaviors. Two indices were created: frequency of stops and degree of intrusion
during those stops.
4. Experiential and Performance-Based Evaluations of the Police
Respondents were asked to report on their general views about police. Domains included
police performance in crime control, police legality in making stops, and police procedural
justice in forming and implementing police policies and services (overall procedural justice
of the police in the neighborhood).
5. Personal Stop Experience
Respondents were asked about several features of their own stop experiences. They were
asked to identify the one stop in the past year that was the most salient: the stop whose
details "stood out" and that they remembered most clearly. Police stop experiences
included perceptions of the legality of the stop reason and four dimensions of the quality
of police treatment: outcome, police decision making during the stop, police use of
authority during the stop (procedural justice), and the degree of physical intrusion and
force during the stop.
III. Results
Results are reported with standard errors clustered by neighborhood. Within the sample,
549 respondents indicated some past year personal contact (including either car or street
stops), while 712 indicated they had had no contact (44 percent). A higher percentage--85
percent--of respondents reported at least some lifetime contact through either a street
stop or a car stop.
Since some of the results ask about personal experience, we estimated selection
parameters to distinguish those with past year police contact or lifetime police contact from
respondents with no past year or lifetime police stop experience. The nonrandom assign-
ment to prior stop conditions is a problem common in observational studies (see Berk
Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 763
2003) and requires the estimation of additional parameters to avoid common selection
problems. Following Berk (Berk & Hickman 2005) and others (Bang & Robins 2005;
Indurkhya et al. 2006; Rosenbaum & Rubin 1983), we use propensity scores to adjust for
this problem. In short, propensity scores are the estimated probability of membership in
each of the stop groups that accounts for confounding variables between the outcomes of
interest (e.g., legitimacy and law-related behaviors) and the stop conditions. There is no
reason ex ante to suspect that within this sample of young adult males ages 18­26 people
with prior stop experience would be more or less affected by that stop experience than
would be persons who have no prior contact. Accordingly, there is no risk of confounding
of selection factors and outcomes, making these analytic conditions appropriate for adjust-
ments using propensity scores (Bang & Robins 2005; Rosenbaum & Rubin 1983).
Separate logistic regression equations were estimated for past year stop experience
and lifetime stop experience. Predictors included race/ethnicity, age, education level,
public housing residency, and criminal justice history (results are shown in Appendix 2).
For both past year and lifetime stop experience, the respondent's educational attainment
(high school graduate or above) and self-reported criminal justice history (arrest or con-
viction) predicted stop experience. Predicted values for these equations were generated
and served as propensity scores in each of the analyses that focused on personal experiences
where only those with a past year or lifetime stop provided assessments of conditions of
specific stops.
1. General and Personal Experiences with Police
We assessed several questions on the effects of both personal experience and generalized
perceptions of police stops on perceived legitimacy of the police. The full sample was
included, and controls were introduced to adjust for the probability of police contact as a
potential influence on those assessments.
Was street and car stop contact with the police associated with views about legitimacy?
At the margins, those with personal contact ranked the police significantly lower in
legitimacy (2.84 vs. 2.93, on a 1­4 scale, with high scores indicating high legitimacy;
t(1,259) = 3.23, p < 0.001). The result was significant but with a modest effect size. The
estimated effects of personal contact may have been attenuated, given that all study partici-
pants, including those without personal contact, had the opportunity to observe police stop
activity in their neighborhoods and likely formed opinions about police legitimacy based on
these observations as well as their personal experiences. They also could have vicarious
experiences through police stops of their friends, family members, neighbors, and others
moving about in their neighborhoods. This first set of analyses considered both these
potential influences on police legitimacy, unconditioned by situational or individual factors.
The conditional question of street stop influences on legitimacy was addressed
through an OLS regression of the influence of the number and nature of stops on
legitimacy. In this case, the dependent variable was respondents' overall perceived legiti-
macy of the police. Two models of legitimacy were considered. First, the analysis considered
the role of personal history of stops and estimates of the frequency of stops in the respon-
dent's neighborhood. Second, it estimated the effects of observed or generalized
764 Tyler et al.
experiences with the police. Predictors included the number of stops and the degree of
police intrusion, both in the respondent's own prior personal experience and as a percep-
tion of general police behavior. An interaction between stop frequency and police intru-
siveness controlled for the density of harsh police stops.
The analysis controlled for two background factors. The first was the propensity to be
stopped. This variable was constructed using race, age, education, public housing resi-
dence, and criminal justice history. Public housing was singularly important because it has
been the locus of intensive police enforcement, and because the patrol tactics in those
high-rise buildings have been conducted in a manner different from patrols in other areas
(Fagan et al. 2012; Carlis 2009). The models included fixed effects for neighborhood and
standard errors were clustered by neighborhood. Table 2 shows the results.
For personal experiences, more intrusive police contact was associated with
more negative evaluations in terms of legitimacy, suggesting that people reacted to the
intrusiveness of their prior experience, not the number of stops. In other words, whether
the police threatened or used force or were humiliating or disrespectful were the strongest
predictors of respondents' assessments of police legitimacy.
Results for general neighborhood experience are also shown in Table 2. The amount
of explained variance (adjusted R2) for this general level model is 0.290, suggesting that
general-level judgments mattered more than personal experiences, for which the adjusted
R2 was 0.149. Again, legitimacy was significantly explained by the intrusiveness of police
stops. Both believing that there were many stops and that they were intrusive appear to

shape legitimacy in a negative direction, with general judgments about what the police were
doing in the neighborhood estimated to be stronger influences than personal experience.
At the general level, respondents were influenced by the perceived number of police stops,
the intrusion of those stops, and the number of harsh stops (the interaction).
Among this community sample, more intrusive police actions were associated with
lower ratings of police legitimacy. Overall, the view that there is more police intrusion of
any type in the lives of people in the neighborhood was linked to lower legitimacy. The
results with this sample from a limited age range (18­26) of persons with the highest
probability of being stopped comport with results from other studies. For example, Fagan
and Piquero (2007) have shown that among young criminal offenders in the same age
range, the basic concepts of legitimacy and "positive" policing are robust predictors
of legitimacy. Further, the results follow the pattern found by Fagan and Tyler (2005)
in a study of the interactions of younger adolescents ages 10­16 with the police.
2. Neighborhood Police Behavior and Legitimacy
How were evaluations of the justice of police behavior related to the impact of that behavior
on legitimacy? The issue here was whether police intrusion was directly related to legitimacy
or whether the relationship was mediated by evaluations of the justice of police actions. This
question was addressed by examining the influence of personal experience on the per-
ceived legitimacy of the police. To assess this reaction, respondents were asked to provide
more detailed information about the recent experience that "stands out most clearly in
[their] mind, or that affected [them] the most." It is that critical experience that is central
to this analysis. Controls included background factors and the probability of experiencing
a stop in the past year. Results are shown in Table 3.
Respondents reported lower police legitimacy when stops were assessed as being
procedurally unfair, illegal, and leading to unfair outcomes. These findings suggest that the
level of exposure to policing did not significantly predict legitimacy, once the fairness of
treatment during the stop and police legality were introduced. Respondents saw the police
as more legitimate when the police were viewed as having acted fairly and lawfully.
3. Police Practice and Police Legitimacy
The previous analysis suggested that respondents' recent personal experiences shaped
their reactions to police authority, particularly the manner in which they experience the
procedural fairness in the "critical" stop. It is similarly possible to consider how people's
general judgments about the police behaviors that they observe in their neighborhood have
shaped their views about police legitimacy. OLS regressions were again used to examine the
influence of these general judgments on assessments of police legitimacy.
One reason for stratifying and oversampling by neighborhood was the fact that there
are strong differences in policing by neighborhood and race, especially with respect to
proactivity, including stop and frisk activity (Fagan et al. 2012; Geller & Fagan 2010; Fagan
2010, 2012). This broader spatial pattern suggests that exposure to policing--specifically, to
police stops--varies by race. Accordingly, we disaggregated the third model in Table 4--
766 Tyler et al.
estimating legitimacy--by race and examined separate regressions. Models were estimated
both for the full sample and then for each race/ethnicity group.5
Table 4 shows that this set of general judgments about police behavior during street or
car stops explains 41.4 percent of the variance in estimating perceived police legitimacy.
Police legitimacy was found to be significantly higher among respondents who felt that the
police used fair procedures that gave neighborhood views a chance to be heard to determine
their policies and if the police acted fairly when they implemented them. In addition to
procedural justice, the legality of police actions and police performance mattered.
The race-specific models in Table 4 show similar results, with minor differences
between population groups. For African Americans, intrusive stops were associated with
lower legitimacy, while procedurally just stops were associated with greater police legiti-
macy. Safety was important as well, with effective performance raising legitimacy. For
Hispanics, safety, fairness, and legality were important. Whites reacted to procedural justice
in forming and implementing policies, but not to police performance. Perhaps their views
were shaped by the fact that they live in relatively safer areas and have less exposure to
crime--through both personal experience and generalized observations--than other
population groups in the city.
5Other racial and ethnic groups were omitted due to small sample sizes. These primarily were East Asians and
South Asians.

Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 767
Our estimate of the effects of police actions on perceived police legitimacy may be
skewed by the unique context of stop and frisk tactics as practiced in New York for the past
20 years. Over this time, police have placed a premium both on the saturation of high-crime
communities with stop and frisk activity (Bratton & Knobler 1998; Zimring 2011) and the
aggressiveness of those stops (Maple & Mitchell 2000; Spitzer 1999; Kelling & Sousa 2001;
Howell 2009). In a broader context, we would expect these stops to range from benign and
nonintrusive to aggressive and physically rough, varying with the police regime (Brunson &
Weitzer 2009). But in this regime, these stops may have leaned toward the nonpolite end of
the continuum (Geller 2014). So the truncated style of policing is a potentially important
limit on the substantive conclusion on style in the piece.
Still, there is sufficient variation within these data to estimate the effects of stop
interaction quality at the extremes from very polite and respectful to harsh and demean-
ing. Figures 1 and 2 show the responsiveness of respondents' perceived legitimacy along
a continuum of reports of police quality of treatment. We estimated Lowess smoothed
graphs (Cleveland 1979) of perceived legitimacy both for general police treatment in the
neighborhood (Figure 1) and for police treatment during respondents' personal contacts
with the police (Figure 2). Both figures show sensitivity of legitimacy estimates to quality
of police treatment across the range of both general and personal police treatment.
Across the range of police treatment, perceived legitimacy increases as legitimacy scores

rise from their minimum value (poor treatment) to their highest value. In this setting,
then, while polite cops generate far greater perceived legitimacy, even incremental
changes at the extremes of impolite treatment produce a positive response in perceived
legitimacy. Even in a rough regime of proactive policing, the dose response of legitimacy
to fair treatment is evident.
Given the influence of performance judgments on legitimacy, it is important to ask
what people mean by effective performance. An examination of the underlying correlations
indicated that the police were viewed as more effective when they were seen as engaging in
fewer street and car stops (r = -.0267), and seen as less intrusive (r = -0.424). Perceived
effectiveness was also linked to following the law (r = 0.333) and using fair procedures to
determine (r = 0.387) and implement (r = 0.457) policing in the community. Of particular
relevance to the current discussion, the perceived effectiveness of the police performance
against crime was negatively related to the number and intrusiveness of police stops.
The important lesson in the race- and ethnicity-specific models in Table 4 was the
universal importance of procedural justice both in policy implementation and in the
manner in which stops take place. White and Hispanic respondents' perceptions of legiti-
macy were also tied to whether or not they believed that the police generally used appro-
priate and legal criterion when deciding to make stops. The intersection of both
procedural fairness and legality, together with sensitivity to intrusive and harsh police
stops, in perceptions of legitimacy suggests a detailed picture of an ecology of policing in
a diverse city.

neighborhoods. This analysis was separately conducted for neighborhood experiences in
the past year and in the respondent's lifetime, both for personal experience and for
general neighborhood experience with police stops. The analyses examined the influ-
ence of prior exposure on: (1) whether respondents viewed the "critical" stop they
experienced as legal (i.e., did the police have a "good reason for the stop"), (2) whether
they were treated unfairly in the "critical" stop in the past year (i.e., "treated unfairly"),
(3) whether the police generally made stops legally ("police legality in stops"), and (4)
whether stops were generally conducted in procedurally fair ways ("police procedural
justice during stops").
For past year experiences, Table 5 suggests adverse effects of an increasing number of
police stops on perceptions of fairness and legality, both in terms of views about personal
experience and with general judgments about police behavior. The analysis considers four
dimensions of experience with police as the dependent variable: whether there was a "good
reason for the stop," the procedural fairness and interaction quality of police during the stop,
whether the respondent felt that the police treated him fairly, and the respondents'
judgments about the legality of the stop. Legality included questions about whether the stop
was racially neutral and whether police followed the law in making the stop and
theircomportment during the stop. Fair treatment included questions about fair treatment
and treatment with dignity and respect. Good reason was a subjective appraisal of the adequacy
of the police reasons for making stops generally in the respondent's neighborhood. Police
procedural justice asks respondents to rate police conduct generally during stops with respect
to fair and respectful policing.
For both generalized and personal experiences, the evaluation of police conduct
showed negative effects with increasing stop experience. In each instance, respondents with
more experience were more inclined to see each additional stop as unjustified, legally
questionable, and characterized by unfair and poor treatment. Perceptions of the legality
and appropriateness of police stops were increasingly negative with each additional stop
reported. Perceptions of police procedural fairness also were increasingly negative with
each marginal stop.
These negative views of police conduct suggest that once subjects have a personal
benchmark or basis of comparison, future stops appear to be seen as increasingly unreason-
able and antagonizing. In the context of the very low "hit rates" in these stops for arrests or
summons (Fagan 2012; Gelman et al. 2007) and the nearly total failure to seize guns or other
contraband (Fagan 2010, 2012; Geller & Fagan 2010), each marginal stop appears to increase
the negative emotional freight of a stop with respect to how citizens experience the law.
These increasingly negative views are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The figures show

ofrespondent experiences. As is clear from the figures, more experiences lead respondents
to view the police more negatively.

Does legitimacy shape personal law-related behaviors? The premise of this article is that
police legitimacy matters because it shapes behavior. To test this argument, we estimated

OLS regressions for three specific law-related behaviors: recent criminal activity;6 coopera-
tion with the police; and cooperation with the legal system. The latter was measured by
respondents' willingness to serve on a jury if asked.
Of the three dependent variables it is recent criminal activity that is most problematic
as a self-report measure (Piquero et al. 2002, 2014). However, there is substantial evidence
that self-report is a good proxy for actual behavior (Thornberry & Krohn 2000). In addi-
tion, the analysis controls for long-term criminality by controlling for criminal justice
history, which is included in the propensity score.
The predictors included legitimacy and factors related to the manner in which police
conduct stops in the respondent's neighborhood, for example, frequency, intrusiveness, and
legality. We also included a measure of police effectiveness in crime control as well as fearof
crime, two robust predictors of police legitimacy from earlier analyses. Table 6 shows the
results.
Perceived police legitimacy significantly predicted each of the three behaviors, sup-
porting the premise of the project. Legitimacy of the police and frequency of stops, police
intrusiveness in stops, police performance, and fear of crime were significant predictors of
6Criminal activity was highly skewed: about one in five reported any criminal activity in the past year or lifetime.
Accordingly, we used the natural log of the scale to estimate the models in a regression model. Respondents reporting
no criminal activity were recoded to 0.01 to approximate zero criminal activity in the log scale. We also used a
dichotomized variable (activity; no activity) and performed a logical regression.

criminal behavior. Similar conclusions regarding legitimacy emerge irrespective of whether
the study uses a dichotomized measure of activity and a logistic regression analysis (results
not shown)7 or a regression analysis on the log of activity.
The univariate connection between legitimacy and criminal activity is striking. Among
those low in legitimacy (below the mean), 30 percent engage in some form of criminal activity.
Among those high in legitimacy, 15 percent engage in some form of criminal activity. Hence,
low legitimacy doubles the risk of involvement in recent past year criminal activity.
In considering the connection of legitimacy to criminal behavior it is important
to recognize that the causal direction is uncertain. Police may well be harsher with an
individual whose criminal activity is known to them. More information about suspect
demeanor and background would be helpful in sorting this out. Further, criminally
involved individuals may be harsher in their judgments of the police. Nonetheless, it is
striking that legitimacy and criminal behavior are connected and, as has been noted, the
analysis controls for lifetime criminal history, providing a lower boundary on the effects of
personal history on the legitimacy-criminality relationship.
The results for cooperation with police were also strong and confirm the core notion
that legitimacy influences law-related behaviors. Legitimacy promotes cooperation, while
the view that the police conduct was intrusive undermines it. Cooperation with the
courts--in the form of jury service--again suggests the importance of perceived legitimacy
of the police in law-related behaviors. In addition to legitimacy, police effectiveness was also
a significant predictor of cooperation with the police, suggesting that respondents' behav-
iors were shaped by their perceptions of both legitimacy and effectiveness. The separate
combination of effectiveness and legitimacy suggests that these may be distinct factors in
the ways that police stops affect law-related behaviors.
IV. Conclusion
Discussions of street stops typically focus on two issues: the legality of police actions and the
effectiveness of street stops in shaping the rate of violent or other crime. The purpose of this
study is to raise and examine a third potentially important criterion for evaluating police
interactions with young men on the street. Those interactions can potentially shape the
views of these young men about the legitimacy of the police and, through those evaluations,
influence a variety of behaviors important to the legal system.
By focusing on legality and performance, legal authorities define the law in a top-
down hierarchical framework in which elite decisions define policies and practices and the
goal is to secure public compliance via the threat of punishment and/or the promise of
performance in service delivery of safety. This command and control model contrasts
starkly with the concerns of earlier eras in which legal culture, and in particular the popular
legitimacy of the police and courts, was central to discussions about the law and the policies
and practices of the police and courts (Sarat 1977). Questions of legality engage lawyers and

effectiveness police professionals, leaving the public out of discussions about how
law is practiced in their own communities. This analysis points to the costs of such an
approach.
The results of this study suggest that legitimacy matters, and that legitimacy deficits
are real in their consequences for public safety. They show that higher legitimacy is related
to lower levels of criminal behavior and also demonstrate that cooperation with the police
is greater when legitimacy is high. Hence, models of policing that are insensitive to issues
of popular legitimacy are unsuccessful in their own terms (i.e., in terms of crime reduc-
tion). They are further unsuccessful in terms of the emerging goals of motivating public
cooperation with the police and engagement in communities (Tyler & Jackson 2014).
These findings suggest that while studies indicate that risk perceptions, performance
evaluations, and legitimacy all motivate compliance, the goals of cooperation and engage-
ment are more strongly linked to legitimacy.
Given the importance of perceptions of legitimacy in predicting law-related behavior,
the factors predicting legitimacy are also important. This study suggests that several factors
were relevant, including, notably, the behavior of the police. In the case of personal
experience, police intrusions in the form of use of force/arrest had negative consequences
for feelings, acceptance of police authority, and legitimacy. The degree of intrusion was
linked to reactions, with more intrusion undermining legitimacy to a greater degree.
A second factor was performance. It is clear that police performance was important.
For example, perceptions of general police competence in fighting crime shaped perceived
legitimacy, as did judgments of the appropriateness of police conduct. In the case of personal
experience, people were more accepting of street stops when they saw an appropriate legal
reason for their stop. With general judgments about police behavior in the neighborhood,
people cared whether the police generally used appropriate legal criterion when making
stop decisions. In both cases, therefore, people cared about the appropriateness of police
conduct.
People also put heavy weight on the fairness of police behavior, including the fairness
of the outcome of encounters with the police and the fairness of the way the police exercise
their authority. The justice of police actions (i.e., perceived procedural justice) was espe-
cially important. It was typically the most important observed element that respondents
reacted to when they had a personal experience with the police. In particular, people
focused on the quality of their interpersonal treatment. Justice judgments were central to
reactions both to personal experiences and to general judgments about the behavior of the
police. This suggests that it was not street stops per se, or even the intrusions that they make
into people's lives, but whether people evaluate police actions as involving fair interper-
sonal treatment and appropriate justification.
A separate issue is whether fairness mattered to respondents after they had a stop
history. The results suggest that being treated fairly remained central to the impact of
police actions on views about police legitimacy. The nature of procedural justice in police
stops mattered greatly, no matter how many prior stops a person had had. People became
upset and formed more negative views if they felt that the police were treating them without
"dignity and respect," not "respecting their rights," and not "trying to do what was right."
This is true irrespective of the number of prior stops. To illustrate this we can look at the
Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 775
correlation between legitimacy and whether a person was treated fairly among those people
who have been stopped over 10 times. That correlation is r = 0.42, p < 0.001. In contrast, the
same correlation for people being stopped the first time is r = 0.40, p < 0.001. In other
words, whether the police are seen as acting fairly shapes the reactions to a pivotal experi-
ence both for those with little and for those with substantial prior experience with the
police. However, we also showed that assessments of procedural justice during stops decline
with increasing exposure and experience. Accordingly, procedural justice matters greatly,
but is fragile and declines with high stop exposure. To the extent that legitimacy is an
important outcome of police contact, legitimacy is quite sensitive to the manner in which
these contacts unfold and the overall exposure of citizens to involuntary police stops and
street detentions.
Put another way, the findings indicate that the more experiences respondents had
with the police, the less likely they were to indicate that the police treated them fairly and
that police actions were lawful. Although it is possible that people with more negative views
about the police have more negative opinions about their treatment, controls were
included for criminal justice history and demographic features. Hence, these findings
suggest that people who have more contact with the police evaluate their later contacts as
less fair and lawful, in turn leading to a corrosive influence of contact on the psychological
judgments underlying legitimacy.
These findings bear directly on the question of whether the police can stop people as
often as they want as long as those people feel that they are being treated fairly and
respectfully (Epp 2013). In this study, being repeatedly stopped by the police on the street
or in a car led people to experience their direct encounters with the police as both less fair
and less lawful. There are several possible explanations for this result. The first is that
people who experience multiple stops increasingly question the reasonableness of police
actions. The other is that respondents' actions change and they act differently when dealing
with the police on later occasions, provoking different behavior from the police.
And, the findings suggest that these results are hardly abstract: there are conse-
quences of the effects of legitimacy for full participation of young persons in the
co-production of security for all residents of their neighborhoods and of the city. Those
who view the police as less legitimate are more likely to engage in criminal conduct and less
willing to cooperate with the police and the courts.
The study's limitations suggest caution in interpreting the results. In particular, this
was a cross-sectional analysis and all the questions were answered at one point in time based
on retrospective reports of police contacts and interactions. Therefore, we fall short of the
necessary conditions to identify causal effects (Sampson et al. 2013). This is particularly
important in the case of recent criminal activity, where the hypothesized relationship would
require legitimacy to influence, rather than being influenced by, criminal activity. To
attempt to control for this reverse influence the analysis included respondents' broader
criminal justice history as a factor in the equation. Despite the effort to introduce such
relevant controls, the correlational nature of the relationships shown should be recognized
and appropriate cautions should be made in understanding the findings. The study's
strengths are important to note as well: its focus on the neighborhoods and persons most
likely to experience involuntary police contact in a proactive policing regime.

Appendix 1: Variables and Measures
Legitimacy
A 35-item scale was created with 13 positive and 12 negative items, each with a four-point "agree
strongly" to "disagree strongly" format (alpha = 0.86). The positive items were: "Overall, the
police are honest"; "People's basic rights are well protected by the police"; "The police usually
make decisions that are good for everyone in the community"; "The police treat everyone
equally regardless of their race"; "I am proud of the work the police do in my neighborhood";
"I feel that people should support the police"; "People should accept the decisions made by
the police"; "If the police tell you to do something, you should do it"; "It is your duty to accept
the decisions made by the police even when you disagree with them"; "It is your duty to do
what the police tell you to do, even if you do not understand or agree with their reasons"; "It is
your duty to do what the police tell you to do, even if you do not like the way they treat you"; "The
police usually act in ways that are consistent with your sense of right and wrong"; and "You
generally agree with the values the police defend." The negative items were: "Laws are meant
to be broken"; "It is ok to do anything you want"; "There are no right or wrong ways to make
money"; "It is alright to break a law if you think the law is wrong"; "Sometimes you have to bend
the law to get things to come out right"; "There are times when it is ok to ignore what the police
tell you to do"; "The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of
people like me"; "People in power use the law to try to control people like me"; "The law does
not protect my interests"; "It is alright to get around the law as long as you don't actually break
it"; "It is hard to blame someone for breaking the law if they can get away with it"; and "People
do not need to obey a law if they had nothing to do with making that law."
Recent Criminal Activity
Respondents were asked to indicate: "Over the last 12 months how often have you" (frequently,
sometimes, seldom, almost never or never) been: "injured someone in a fight" (85 percent said
Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 781
never); "taken money or goods from someone by force or threat of force" (96 percent said
never); "carried a weapon such as a gun or knife" (91 percent said never); "stolen something
worth over $50" (98 percent said never); and "sold marijuana or other drugs" (96 percent said
never). Because the scale was skewed toward noncriminal activity, it was transformed in two
ways. First, an overall scale was constructed with three levels: no criminal behavior (77 percent;
n = 975); low levels (11 percent; n = 144); and high levels (11 percent; n = 142). Second, an
alternate scale was created using the log of the criminal behavior scale.
Cooperation
Help the Police
Respondents were asked three questions, with responses scaled "very likely" (1) to "very
unlikely" (4). The questions were: "If you knew of someone from your neighborhood who
had broken a law and was wanted how likely would you be to report them to the police" (27
percent said very likely); "If you witnessed a crime or knew about a crime that took place
how likely would you be to report it to the police" (46 percent said very likely); and "If
you witnessed a crime or knew about a crime that took place how likely would you be to
provide information or help the police in an investigation of the crime" (43 percent said
very likely). These three items were combined into a single scale using the mean scale scores
(Alpha = 0.78).
Help the Legal System
Respondents were asked: "If called, how willing would you be to serve on a jury" (26 percent
said very willing; 43 percent said somewhat willing; 17 percent said somewhat unwilling; and
13 percent said very unwilling). These three items also were combined into a single scale
using the mean scale scores (Alpha = 0.79).
Generalized Neighborhood Experience with Police
Frequency of Stops
"Stop people in the street and ask them questions or search them?" and "Stop people in cars
to ask them questions or search them?"
Degree of Intrusion
The intrusiveness of police stops was assessed along several dimensions. The questions
asked about general police behavior rather than personal experience with police, which was
asked separately. For the generalized assessment, subjects were asked how often the police
in their neighborhood: "Physically search people"; "Use harsh or insulting language";
"Threaten to use physical force"; "Take out a weapon, such as a gun, a club or a taser";
"Treat people disrespectfully"; and "Bully or intimidate people." A factor analysis indicated
that these judgments all loaded into a single factor so they were averaged into a single score.

Experiential and Performance-Based Evaluations of the Police
Police Performance
Respondents were asked four questions, two about crime control and two about service
delivery. The items used a "very successful" (1) to "not successful at all" (4) format. The
items were: How successful are the police at "preventing crime in your neighborhood";
"catching the people who commit crimes"; "solving people's problems when they call the
police for help"; and "responding in a timely way to calls for help" (Alpha = 0.75).
Police Use Legal Reasons for Deciding Whether to Stop People
Two items were used, each with a response scale ranging from "frequently" (1) to "never"
(5). The items were: "How often do the police" "stop people without a good reason" and
"stop people based on their race" (Alpha = 0.68).
Police Procedural Justice During Policy Implementation
Four items were used, with a response scale ranging from "frequently" (1) to "never" (5).
The items were: "How often do the police" "use fair procedures when making decisions
about what to do"; "make decisions that are consistent with the law"; "treat people fairly";
and "treat people with courtesy and respect" (Alpha = 0.70).
Police Procedural Justice During Policy Creation
Respondents were asked: "How much do police consider your views and the views of people
like yourself when deciding how the police should handle crime in your neighborhood" (16
percent said a great deal; 42 percent said somewhat; 21 percent said a little; and 20 percent
said not much at all).
Personal Experience During the Stop
Affect
Respondents were asked about their feelings at the time of the experience using four items
("strongly agree" (1) to "strongly disagree" (4)). They were asked: "Did you feel": satisfied;
safe; scared (reverse scored); and/or angry (reverse scored) (Alpha = 0.73).
Decision Acceptance
Respondents were asked: "How willing they were to accept the decision made by the police"
("very willing" (33 percent); somewhat willing (43 percent); somewhat unwilling (12
percent); and "very unwilling" (13 percent)) and "How much they considered going to
others to complain" (a great deal (19 percent); somewhat (12 percent); a little (15
percent); and "not much at all" (54 percent)). The second item was reversed and a scale
constructed (Alpha = 0.52).
Street Stops and Police Legitimacy 783
Legal Reason for Your Stop
Respondents were asked to strongly agree (23 percent); somewhat agree (35 percent);
somewhat disagree (11 percent); or strongly disagree (31 percent) that "[t]he police had a
legitimate reason to stop you."
Outcome Fairness
Respondents were asked two questions and responded on a scale ranging from "strongly
agree" (1) to "strongly disagree" (4). The questions were: "You received a fair outcome" and
"You received the outcome you deserved according to the law" (Alpha = 0.83).
Quality of Decision Making
Respondents were asked five questions and responded on a scale ranging from "strongly
agree" (1) to "strongly disagree" (4). The questions were: "The police used fair procedures
when making decisions about what to do"; "The police let you tell your side of the story";
"The police explained why they stopped you in a way that was clear to you"; "The police got
the facts they needed to make good decisions"; and "The police made their decisions in a
neutral and unbiased way" (Alpha = 0.85).
Quality of Treatment
Respondents were asked five questions and responded on a scale ranging from "strongly
agree" (1) to "strongly disagree" (4). The questions were: "The police treated you fairly";
"The police gave consideration to your views when deciding what to do"; "The police tried
to do what was fair"; "The police treated you with dignity and courtesy"; and "The police
respected your rights" (Alpha = 0.88).
Degree of Police Intrusion
Questions about police behavior were: Did the police: "ask your name" and/or "ask for
some form of identification"; search/use force "frisk or pat you down"; "search your bags";
"threaten to use physical force"; "actually use physical force"; "handcuff you"; "take out a
weapon, such as a gun, a club or a taser"; and/or "threaten to use a weapon"; and (3) arrest
"take you to the police station"; and/or "arrest you."
