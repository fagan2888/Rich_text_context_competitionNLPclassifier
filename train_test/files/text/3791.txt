Introduction
Adipose tissue has been increasingly recognised as an
active endocrine organ that not only responds to afferent
signals via numerous receptors but also secretes a variety of
adipokines.1 The considerable differences in secreted adi-
pokines characterise adipose tissue and contribute to its
anatomical regional heterogeneity.2 While the association
between visceral adiposity, for example, and the proinflam-
matory status has been proposed,3 the role of perivascular
adipose tissue (PVAT), however, has been less clear. PVAT-
derived adiponectin has been shown to have a vasoprotec-
tive impact through its vasodilatory properties and
stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).4,5
However, a contrary role for PVAT as atherogenic is sup-
ported by studies in obese humans and mice, where hyper-
trophy of adipocytes result in the migration of monocytes
via the release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP-1).2,6­9 Subsequently, the production of proinflam-
matory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-)

Abstract
Background and aims: Imaging studies have relied on the `overall' volumetric quantification of perivascular adipose
tissue. We sought to assess the relationship of circumferential distribution between perivascular adipose tissue and
adjacent wall thickness of carotid and aortic arteries using dedicated magnetic resonance imaging sequences.
Methods: Vessel wall and perivascular adipose tissue were acquired using magnetic resonance imaging (1.5
T). Co-
registered images were segmented separately, and measurements of both perivascular adipose tissue and vessel wall
were obtained along radii of the vessel spaced at angles of 5° each.
Results: In total, 29 patients were recruited. Perivascular adipose tissue thickness of the aorta was 3.34
±0.79mm
with specific pattern of `double peaks' distribution, while carotid perivascular adipose tissue had no identifiable pattern
with thickness of 0.8
±
0.91
mm. Although statistically significant, the correlation between perivascular adipose tissue
thickness and wall thickness in carotid arteries with normal (r=0.040, p=0.001) or with abnormal wall thickness (r=­
0.039, p=0.015) was merely nominal. Similarly, perivascular adipose tissue of the aorta had very weak correlation with
normal aortic wall thickness (r=0.010, p=0.008) but not with the abnormal ones (r=-0.05, p=0.29).
Conclusion: Dissociation between the spatial distribution of perivascular adipose tissue and arterial wall thickening
in the aorta and carotid arteries does not support that perivascular adipose tissue has a causal role in promoting
atherosclerotic plaque via a paracrine route. Yet, perivascular adipose tissue functional properties were not examined
in this study.

in differentiated monocytes leads to direct inhibition of
insulin signalling in adipocytes.2,6­9
While there is a lack of consensus on whether PVAT has
a protective or pro-atherosclerotic role, there is more evi-
dence to suggest that PVAT is locally regulated and exerts
its effect via paracrine adipokine signalling.10,11 The ana-
tomical proximity of PVAT and vessel wall and the evi-
dence of their connectivity through microvessels have
fuelled the arguments of potential cross-talk and possibil-
ity that PVAT may be involved in the initiation and pro-
gression of atherosclerosis.12 The direct interaction
between PVAT with the outer adventitia has suggested the
ability to convey adipokines to vessel wall via the vasa
vasorum.13,14 Moreover, the absence of atherosclerosis in
segments of `myocardial bridging' where heart muscle
insulates a coronary artery from any adipose tissue has
also favoured the argument for PVAT role in the develop-
ment of vascular disease.12
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to
great effect for the high-resolution characterisation of
carotid arteries and aorta.15­17 Differential suppression
techniques can be used to isolate signals from fat or water,
which separates PVAT (by suppressing water signal) and
vessel wall (by suppressing fat signal) accurately, thus
overcoming the difficulty of the anatomical proximity.
Accordingly, we reasoned that systematic evaluation of the
spatial relationships between arterial wall thickening/ath-
erosclerosis and adjacent PVAT with MRI may inform the
contentious issue of whether PVAT has an atheroprotective
or atherogenic role.
The aims of this study were to use vascular MRI (1) to
study the distribution of PVAT in relation to the carotid
arteries and aorta and (2) to establish whether there is a
relationship between the distribution of PVAT and wall
thickening/atherosclerosis.
Patients and methods
Study population
Patients scheduled for invasive coronary angiogram at
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust were recruited
and scanned at the University of Oxford Centre for Clinical
Magnetic Resonance Research (OCMR). Patients were
adult (>18years) and were scheduled either (1) electively
for assessment of symptoms suggestive of coronary artery
disease and/or valvular heart disease or (2) urgent admis-
sion with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS was
defined as chest discomfort associated with electrocardio-
gram (ECG) changes and/or elevated cardiac biomarkers.
Patients with known chronic inflammatory conditions,
infections, malignancies or contraindications to MRI were
excluded. All included patients in this study provided writ-
ten informed consent. The study protocol conformed to the
ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the National Research Ethics Services
(NRES) and local R&D committee prior to commence-
ment of the study.
MRI protocol
Patients were imaged on a Siemens Sonata 1.5-T scanner
(Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). A black-blood
turbo spin echo (TSE), fat suppressed sequence was
acquired to localise carotid bifurcation, which was used as
a landmark to obtain carotid images. T1-weighted TSE
[repetition time (TR):echo time (TE) 700:12ms] spanned
the carotid bifurcation with 13 slices of 3
mm thickness.
Slices were centralised on the identified carotid bifurca-
tion and used to measure vessel wall thickness. Fat satura-
tion sequence (field of view 150
×150mm, TR:TE
750:12
ms, in-plane spatial resolution 0.39
×0.39mm,
water suppression) was acquired to match the obtained
T1-weighted slices and suppressing signal from vessel
wall producing a separated and enhanced fat image.
Similarly, the descending aorta was imaged with a black-
blood TSE, fat suppressed sequence to identify pulmonary
bifurcation as a landmark, with 11 slices of 5mm thickness
were acquired downwards. T1-weighted TSE (TR:TE 750:
11
ms), of 11 slices of 5
mm thickness of the descending
thoracic aorta, with matching fat saturated slices, were
obtained.
Data analysis
Both PVAT and vessel wall images were analysed using
measurements along the radii of the vessel passing through
cords on the vessel circumference. These cords were at
evenly spaced out angles of 5° (starting from 0° to 355°;
i.e. 72 cords per vessel image). All images were analysed
by an experienced observer blinded to patient identity and
background (E.E.). Analyses were performed separately
for the aorta and for the carotid arteries. This process
was executed using Image-Pro Plus software (Media
Cybernetics, Rockville, MD).
PVAT image segmentation.Segmentation was based on a
threshold intensity method, set at 2 standard deviations
greater than the mean pixel intensity in the whole image
(Figure 1). The user-interface requirements were to
exclude the background and the very bright superficial
subcutaneous tissue and to identify the centre of the vessel
from where the measurements of PVAT will be obtained.
Measurement.There is a little consensus in the literature
as to the anatomical classification of PVAT. Lehman et al.18
used an arbitrary box to identify PVAT when studying
PVAT of the thoracic aorta. Borders of this box were the
anterior border of the vertebral body, the left costoverte-
bral joint and the oesophagus. In another study by the same
288 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 15(4)
group,19 a threshold for PVAT surrounding the abdominal
aorta was set at 5
mm away from the vessel wall. In this
study, we set up a distance from the outer boundary of the
vessel wall to standardise our approach from patient to
patient. The distance used here was derived using 2 stand-
ard deviations of the mean in measurement of PVAT made
from sample images (n=15) and resulting in a threshold at
20mm in the aorta and 9mm in the carotid. The intention
of this method was to include the full physiological range
of normal PVAT distribution, which may have been over-
looked with smaller, arbitrary thresholds.
Using the Line Profile tool, the thickness measurements
of both PVAT and vessel wall were made along the 72
cords around the circumference of the vessel. The centre
from which these measurements were taken was defined
using a software-defined best-fit circle of the vessel wall.
In the carotid arteries' slices, the zero angle position was
defined as the anterior direction, and the angle was
increased in a clockwise rotation. The position of the aorta
relative to the spinal column varied between patients;
therefore, the line drawn between the centre of the verte-
bral body and the centre of the aorta was used as the zero
position. In order to facilitate rapid measurement, macro
scripts for Image-Pro Plus were developed and used to
automate part of the process.
Defining `normal' and `abnormal' vessel walls
For this analysis, individual slices were categorised into
`abnormal' and `normal' groups to allow those slices with
plaque formation to be considered separately and to inves-
tigate the association of atherosclerotic plaque with PVAT.
We identified a subsample of patients for both carotid and
aortic wall with no eccentric or focal thickening using a
modified American Heart Association (AHA) classifica-
tion of vascular wall.20 Maximal vessel wall thickening
across all angles was measured in normal subjects and a
threshold value for segregating `normal' from `abnormal'
slice was set at 3 standard deviations away from mean of
maximal wall thickness. This threshold was used to ensure
that only slices with evident atherosclerosis are grouped
together and to avoid any observer bias in defining normal
versus abnormal slices when applied to the whole cohort.
Statistical analysis
Data were tested for normal distribution using Shapiro­
Wilk test. Data were expressed as frequencies and percent-
ages for categorical variables, mean and (±)standard
deviation for continuous variables or as median accompa-
nied by interquartile range (IQR) for skewed continuous
variables, as appropriate. A test for autocorrelation was
performed on all available measurements included in the
analysis, which were taken at 5° angles and showed strong
autocorrelation. Measurements at angles just 5° apart con-
tain too much similar information to measurements taken
at neighbouring angles, so inclusion of them all would
inappropriately inflate the apparent significance of the
results. Autocorrelation was overcome by including only
angles 20° apart in the analysis. Wall thickness was
regressed on PVAT thickness using hierarchical regression
analysis, with random components for between-person
variance, angle variance and slice variance. In addition,
angle and slice were fitted as categorical predictor varia-
bles to take account of any systematic patterns in these
variables across individuals. The modelled association
between wall thickness and PVAT thickness is, therefore,
in person-specific variance over and above the component
of the pattern by angle and slice that are common across all
people. Analyses were then repeated, with normal and
abnormal slices analysed separately, to find the associa-
tions in the presence and in the absence of atherosclerosis.
Results were reported in terms of regression coefficients,
with confidence intervals (CIs), which were derived from

Results
A total of 29 patients were recruited into the study. One
patient had poor quality MRI for both aorta and carotid
arteries and was excluded from the image analysis. The
remaining patients yielded 1180 of combined carotid and
aortic slices resulting in 84,960 adjoining segments have
been analysed.
The mean age was 68±8years, and 68% of the cohort
was male. Baseline patient clinical characteristics are sum-
marised in Table 1. Most subjects (72%) were elective
admissions for symptoms suggestive of coronary artery
disease. The recruited patients represented a heterogene-
ous cohort ranged from no significant coronary disease
(39%) to severe triple vessel disease requiring bypass sur-
gery in 29%.
PVAT and vessel wall thickness was studied in aorta
with an average of 10.86
±
0.44 slices per patient and in
both left and right carotid arteries yielding an average of
10.2±
1.54 common carotid slices, 2.76
±1.54 internal
carotid and 2.76± 1.54 external carotid slices per patient.
PVAT slices (total of >50) from 10 randomly selected
patients were re-analysed yielding an inter-observer coef-
ficient of variation of 6.12%.
Distribution of PVAT and wall thickness
The mean wall thickness of the aorta was 2.38±0.79mm
with average PVAT thickness of 3.34±0.79mm. Changes
in both aortic wall and PVAT thickness across angles
among individual patients are presented in Figure 2(a) and
(b). The changes in the mean aortic wall thickness across
different angles were largely uniform (IQR: 2.24­2.49mm;
Figure 2(c)), while the mean PVAT thickness appeared to
show wider variations (IQR: 1.96­4.54mm). Interestingly,
the mean PVAT thickness appeared to show a distinctive
pattern of `M' or `double peak' shape across all patients
with maximal peaks at angles 120° and 220°. The disper-
sion of PVAT thickness was larger than the aortic vessel
wall thickness (coefficients of variation 0.90 vs 0.32,
p<0.001).
The mean carotid wall thickness was 1.4±0.6mm with
average carotid PVAT thickness of 0.8±0.91mm. Changes
in both carotid wall and PVAT thickness across angles
among individual patients are presented in Figure 3(a) and
(b). The changes in the mean carotid wall thickness across
angles was largely uniform (IQR: 1.39-1.48
mm; Figure
3(c)), while the mean PVAT thickness appeared to show
wider variations (IQR: 0.66­0.85mm). There was no iden-
tifiable pattern of PVAT distribution, but carotid PVAT
appeared to be thicker between angles 325°-360º and
0°-25°. The dispersion of carotid PVAT thickness was
larger than carotid vessel wall thickness (coefficients of
variation 1.15 vs 0.42, p<0.001).
Association between PVAT and wall thickness
There was a statistically significant but very weak positive
correlation between normal carotid vessel wall and PVAT
thickness [r=0.040 (0.016­0.065), p=0.001], whereas a
negative correlation between abnormal carotid and PVAT
thickness [r=-0.039 (-0.070 to -0.008), p=0.015; Table 2].
Normal aortic wall had a positive association with
PVAT thickness [r
=
0.01 (0.003­0.017), p=0.008], while
abnormal aortic wall did not correlate with PVAT thick-
ness [r=-0.050 (-0.142 to 0.043), p=0.29].
When excluding patients presenting with ACS, the
nominal relationship between PVAT and both aortic and
carotid wall thickness did not change for both normal and
abnormal wall thickness. Similarly, when excluding
patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease, the
relationship between PVAT and carotid wall thickness was
maintained in both normal (0.015, 95% CI: 0.003­0.026,
p
=
0.012) and abnormal carotid wall thickness (-0.066,

tionship between PVAT and aortic wall thickness followed
the same trend of significance with normal (0.011, 95%

Discussion
Using a newly devised methodology to quantify MRI-
identified PVAT, we have demonstrated that (1) PVAT is
more variable than vessel wall thickness among patients
and across angular distribution; (2) aortic PVAT follows a
similar pattern between individuals, while carotid PVAT is
less consistent; and (3) there was no biologically meaning-
ful correlation in angular distribution between PVAT and
atherosclerosis in either aorta or carotid arteries, irrespec-
tive of the burden of atherosclerosis.
While the role of PVAT in promoting atherosclerosis
by secreting pro-atherogenic factors has been widely
considered,12 there is also a significant body of contradictory
evidence to suggest that it has a protective role.4,22,23
Numerous factors related to PVAT, vascular location and the
physiological status of PVAT might contribute to this appar-
ent paradox. The variations of adipocyte composition, stage
of differentiation and morphology with subsequent different
local effect add to the discrepancy in the role of PVAT.10,24
Moreover, the anatomical regional vascular differences have
been reported to influence the role of PVAT.10,24 Therefore,
any broad statement on the selective and predefined role of
PVAT, whether it is pro-atherogenic or vascular protective, is
likely to be overly simplistic.
Imaging has added insights into the atherosclerotic role
of PVAT.18,25 The increase in PVAT measured on computed
tomography (CT), using a distance-based method of the
sum of volume of Hounsfield unit-defined adipose tissue
in a 5-mm increments along the coronary artery, was asso-
ciated with the severity of coronary artery disease and fea-
tures of high-risk atherosclerotic plaques.10,26,27 In this
study, using MRI-driven methodology, the distribution and
association between PVAT and vessel wall thickness
were investigated. We used wall thickness to reflect the

wall thickness of all recruited patients, assigning every patient into different colour and/or different pattern, (b) the individual

atherosclerosis burden, where thick segments represented
more advanced disease. We demonstrated that PVAT dis-
tribution is widely irregular in comparison to vessel wall
thickness irrespective of the degree of wall thickening. We
also showed that aortic PVAT followed a characteristic
pattern with two prominent peaks within the posterior
region of the aortic wall. A similar pattern was not identi-
fied in the carotid artery, but PVAT tended to be thicker
on the anterior surface (angle 325°­25°) compared to
other angles. We detected very weak correlation between
PVAT and adjacent wall thickness in both aorta and carotid
arteries and irrespective of the plaque burden. The correla-
tion coefficient across all groups was very close to 0 (rang-
ing between -0.05 and 0.04), suggesting that there was no
strongly determinant inter-relationship. The p-value in the
`abnormal' aortic slices group did not reach statistical sig-
nificance and is probably a reflective of smaller sample
size compared to other categories. These findings do not
support the hypothesis of the atherosclerotic role of PVAT
via paracrine local effect. Nonetheless, it is important to
highlight that the current analysis did not investigate the
functional properties of PVAT nor its possible impact on
vessel wall composition.
In vitro experiments using human periaortic adipocytes
have shown their ability to stimulate migration of inflamma-
tory cells. In addition, in apolipoprotein E knock-out mice,
there was an increase in infiltrating macrophage within
PVAT and similarly an increase in PVAT release of proin-
flammatory cytokines.28,29 Similarly, in humans, mac-
rophage infiltration and adipokines production were
different comparing PVAT near stenotic and non-stenotic
coronary artery segments.30 Furthermore, imaging studies
have demonstrated an association between the burden of
atherosclerosis and increase PVAT volume.10,25­27 However,

the proposed pro-atherogenic role could be challenged
given the cross-sectional design of these studies, which do
not provide a causal relationship between PVAT and athero-
sclerosis.18,25 A reverse relationship could be proposed
where atherosclerosis and vessel wall inflammation may
lead into increase in PVAT (inside­out theory) and not vice
versa.12 Previous studies have relied on the total volumetric
quantity of PVAT (i.e. ignoring adjacencies) to relate it to
atherosclerosis via a local paracrine influence.10 Adipokines
secreted from PVAT pass through vasa vasorum or through
adventitia and media to reach vessel intima. We did not
identify any relationship between the spatial distribution of
PVAT and atherosclerosis measured as vessel wall thick-
ness; however, few points need to be highlighted. First, the
simultaneous measurements of PVAT and vessel wall thick-
ness may be challenged given the snapshot analysis of a het-
erogonous population. Second, while there may still be an
influence of PVAT on atherosclerosis, its impact may not be
sufficient to show anatomical changes on the vascular wall
as we examined here. Third, the influence of PVAT may be
subtle, for example, on plaque composition or inflammatory
cell infiltrate. Finally, it is arguable that quantification of
PVAT may not play a significant role but rather the change
in its adipocytes character, structure and morphology is
more biologically important. In a post mortem study of 16
patients, coronary atherosclerotic burden expressed as
plaque/media ratio was related to PVAT area and degree of
macrophage infiltration within PVAT.26 In addition, PVAT
was correlated to the presence of lipid core.26 This assess-
ment was made again based on a measured area of 3-mm
circle around the studied coronary vessel.26
This study adds to the body of evidence examining the
possible role of PVAT in atherogenesis. Most reported
studies have focused on coronary arteries and to less extent
aorta. Our study provides for the first time a systematic
detailed description of PVAT of the carotid arteries in addi-
tion to the aorta. While others have used CT to study PVAT,
we have demonstrated the utility of MRI as an alternative
modality. We demonstrated lack of relationship between
the angular distribution of PVAT and arterial wall thick-
ness in the aorta and carotid arteries. Such dissociation
does not support the concept that PVAT has a causal role in
promoting atherosclerosis.
