CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
(CKD) is now recognized as
a common condition that el-
evates the risk of cardiovas-
cular disease as well as kidney failure
and other complications.1-3 The num-
ber of patients with kidney failure
treated by dialysis and transplantation
(the end stage of CKD) has increased
dramatically in the United States from
209 000 in 1991 to 472 000 in 2004.4
The age-, sex-, and race-adjusted inci-
dence of end-stage renal disease in-
creased by 43% during the decade fol-
lowing 1991.4 Estimation of the
prevalence of earlier stages of CKD in
the US population and ascertainment
of trends over time is central to dis-
ease management and prevention plan-
ning, particularly given the increase in
the prevalence of obesity, diabetes,5,6
and hypertension,7,8 the leading risk fac-
tors for CKD.5
Earlier stages of CKD are defined
based on the combination of kidney
damage (most often quantified using al-
buminuria) and decreased kidney func-
tion (quantified as glomerular filtra-
tion rate [GFR] estimated from the
serum creatinine concentration).2 The
National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Surveys (NHANES) have pro-
vided a rigorous basis for estimating
CKD prevalence. These large nation-
ally representative surveys conducted
by the National Center of Health Sta-
tistics (NCHS) include a laboratory as-
sessment of albuminuria and serum cre-
atinine allowing for identification and
staging of CKD regardless of the par-
ticipant or their physician's awareness

Context The prevalence and incidence of kidney failure treated by dialysis and trans-
plantation in the United States have increased from 1988 to 2004. Whether there have
been changes in the prevalence of earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) during
this period is uncertain.
Objective To update the estimated prevalence of CKD in the United States.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of the most recent Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES 1988-1994 and NHANES
1999-2004), a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized adults aged 20
years or older in 1988-1994 (n=15 488) and 1999-2004 (n=13 233).
Main Outcome Measures Chronic kidney disease prevalence was determined based
on persistent albuminuria and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
Persistence of microalbuminuria (30 mg/g) was estimated from repeat visit data in
NHANES 1988-1994. The GFR was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease Study equation reexpressed to standard serum creatinine.
Results The prevalence of both albuminuria and decreased GFR increased from 1988-
1994 to 1999-2004. The prevalence of CKD stages 1 to 4 increased from 10.0% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 9.2%-10.9%) in 1988-1994 to 13.1% (95% CI, 12.0%-
14.1%) in 1999-2004 with a prevalence ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2-1.4). The prevalence
estimates of CKD stages in 1988-1994 and 1999-2004, respectively, were 1.7% (95%
CI, 1.3%-2.2%) and 1.8% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.3%) for stage 1; 2.7% (95% CI, 2.2%-
3.2%) and 3.2% (95% CI, 2.6%-3.9%) for stage 2; 5.4% (95% CI, 4.9%-6.0%) and
7.7% (95% CI, 7.0%-8.4%) for stage 3; and 0.21% (95% CI, 0.15%-0.27%) and 0.35%
(0.25%-0.45%) for stage 4. A higher prevalence of diagnosed diabetes and hyperten-
sion and higher body mass index explained the entire increase in prevalence of albumin-
uria but only part of the increase in the prevalence of decreased GFR. Estimation of GFR
from serum creatinine has limited precision and a change in mean serum creatinine ac-
counted for some of the increased prevalence of CKD.
Conclusions The prevalence of CKD in the United States in 1999-2004 is higher
than it was in 1988-1994. This increase is partly explained by the increasing preva-
lence of diabetes and hypertension and raises concerns about future increased inci-
dence of kidney failure and other complications of CKD.

of the condition. Initial prevalence es-
timates for CKD stages in NHANES
1988-1994 in adults have provided a
benchmark for kidney disease studies,
prevention efforts, and health care plan-
ning.1,9 Later studies have compared
NHANES 1988-1994 estimates with
NHANES 1999-2000 data and found an
increased prevalence of albuminuria but
no significant increase in the overall
prevalence of CKD. The precision of
these trend estimates was constrained
by the relatively small sample size of the
1999-2000 survey10 and limited data to
establish consistent calibration of the
creatinine assays over time. A recent
study calibrating serum creatinine in all
NHANES surveys from 1988 to 2004
permits a more rigorous examination
of the trends in the prevalence of CKD
using standardized creatinine.11 Esti-
mation of GFR from serum creatinine
is the recommended approach for CKD
staging at this time and increasing evi-
dence shows a strong association with
risk even when applied to the general
population.3,12-15

METHODS
Study Population
The NHANES are cross-sectional, mul-
tistage, stratified, clustered probabil-
ity samples of the US civilian noninsti-
tutionalized population conducted by
the NCHS, a branch of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.16 The
NHANES analyzed were conducted
from 1988-1994 in 2 phases (1988-
1991 and 1991-1994) and from 1999-
2004 in 3 phases (1999-2000, 2001-
2002, and 2003-2004), and the data
from the 2 phases and 3 phases, respec-
tively, were combined herein follow-
ing NCHS recommendations.17,18 The
protocols for conduct of NHANES were
approved by the NCHS institutional re-
view board and informed consent was
obtained from all participants.19,20
In all NHANES, certain subgroups of
the population were oversampled in-
cluding Mexican Americans, non-
Hispanic blacks, and elderly persons to
ensure adequate sample sizes of these
groups.Individualsparticipatedinanin-
terview conducted at home and also in
an extensive physical examination per-
formed at a mobile examination center,
which included blood and urine collec-
tion. We limited the study population to
persons examined in a mobile examina-
tion center who were aged 20 years or
older and who were not missing serum
creatinine measurements: 15 488 in
NHANES 1988-1994 (7471 in 1988-
1991 and 8017 in 1991-1994) and
13233 in NHANES 1999-2004 (4101 in
1999-2000, 4684 in 2001-2002, and
4448 in 2003-2004).
Measures of Kidney Function
and Kidney Damage
Serum creatinine was measured using
a kinetic rate Jaffe method. To appro-
priately estimate GFR, all serum cre-
atinine measurements were recali-
brated to standardized creatinine
measurements obtained at the Cleve-
land Clinic Research Laboratory
(Cleveland, Ohio) as detailed re-
cently.11 Briefly, frozen serum samples
(approximately 200 specimens from
NHANES 1988-1994 and each later
2-year survey [1999-2000, 2001-
2002, and 2003-2004]) were thawed
and reassayed for serum creatinine in
2006. Regression models were devel-
oped to correct serum creatinine
values in NHANES 1988-1994 and
1999-2000 (standard creatinine =
­0.184  0.960  NHANES 1988-
1994 uncalibrated serum creatinine
and standard creatinine = 0.147
 1.013  NHANES 1999-2000
uncalibrated serum creatinine). No cor-
rection was needed for the 2001-2002
and 2003-2004 surveys.
The GFR was estimated using the ab-
breviated Modification of Diet in Re-
nal Disease (MDRD) Study formula.
This formula was developed based on
1628 participants in which serum cre-
atinine, age, sex, and race were related
to GFR measured using urinary clear-
ance of 125I-iothalamate.21 The for-
mula initially used serum creatinine
measured by a kinetic rate Jaffe method
but was later reexpressed to use stan-
dard creatinine2 2 as follows:
GFR=175(standardized serum cre-
atinine)-1.154(age)-0.2030.742 (if the
individual is female) or 1.212 (if the
individual is black). Estimated GFR is
reported in mL/min/1.73 m2 and race
is either black or not black. Values that
exceeded 200 mL/min/1.73 m2 were
truncated at that level and individuals
were classified using standard crite-
ria.1 Individuals with estimated GFR be-
low 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stage 5)
were excluded because estimates of this
stage are likely to be unreliable due to
the small number of individuals and the
likelihood that many of these individu-
als are ill or receiving dialysis and would
have a low response rate.
A random spot urine sample was ob-
tained from participants examined at a
mobile examination center using a
clean-catch technique and sterile con-
tainers. Frozen nonhematuric speci-
mens were analyzed. Urine albumin and
creatinine concentrations were mea-
sured in the same laboratory during all
surveys. Albumin was measured by
solid phase fluorescence immunoas-
say and urine creatinine was mea-
sured by the modified kinetic Jaffe
method using a Synchron AS/Astra Ana-
lyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton,
California). Urinary albumin-to-
creatinine ratio was computed and is re-
ported in milligrams per gram. Albu-
minuria is defined as an albumin-to-
creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g or higher,
with microalbuminuria defined as an
albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g
to 299 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria de-
fined as an albumin-to-creatinine ra-
tio of 300 mg/g or higher.
Persistent albuminuria was defined
as kidney damage (CKD stages 1-2).
Repeated measurements obtained ap-
proximately 2 weeks after the original
examination in a subset of 1241 par-
ticipants in NHANES 1988-1994 were
used to estimate the persistence of mi-

croalbuminuria as described previ-
ously.1,9,10 Briefly, the proportion of
individuals with persistent albumin-
uria was calculated as the proportion
with albuminuria at a single visit 
50.9% for those with microalbumin-
uria and an estimated GFR of more
than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; 75.0% for
those with microalbuminuria and an es-
timated GFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73
m2; and 100% for those with macroal-
buminuria regardless of estimated GFR.
These same persistence estimates were
applied to both surveys and all age, sex,
and race groups thereby influencing
only the prevalence of CKD stages 1
and 2 but not trends over time or as-
sociations with other factors. Stan-
dard errors (SEs) incorporate sam-
pling variation in the persistence
estimates above. All albuminuria
analyses excluded women who were
pregnant or menstruating.
The CKD stages were categorized
based on the classification system es-
tablished by the National Kidney Foun-
dation Kidney Disease Outcomes Qual-
ity Initiative.1 The CKD stages are
defined as follows: stage 1, persistent
albuminuria with an estimated GFR
higher than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; stage
2, persistent albuminuria with an esti-
mated GFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2;
stage 3, a GFR of 30 to 59 mL/min/
1.73 m2; and stage 4, a GFR of 15 to 29
mL/min/1.73 m2. NHANES 1999-
2004 participants were asked if they
were aware they had "weak or failing
kidneys" and the responses were tabu-
lated by the presence of markers of
CKD.
Assessment of Demographics
and Risk Factors for Kidney Disease
NHANES included measurement of
height and weight, which was used for
thecalculationofbodymassindex(BMI;
calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared). In-
formation on age, sex, race/ethnicity
(categorized as non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Mexican Ameri-
can,orallother)andsmokingwasbased
on self-report during the interview por-
tion of the survey. Smoking status was
determined using answers to the ques-
tions: "Have you smoked at least 100
cigarettesinyourlife?"and"Doyounow
smoke cigarettes?" Hypertension and
diabetes were defined by a physician di-
agnosisthatwasself-reportedbythepar-
ticipant because CKD is most strongly
related to these conditions. Fasting glu-
cose (available for only half of the par-
ticipants) and measured blood pres-
sure were not used in the primary
analysis but yielded similar results in
sensitivity analyses (data not shown).
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were performed incorporat-
ing the sampling weights to obtain un-
biased estimates from the complex
NHANES sampling design using Stata
version 8.2 (StataCorp, College Sta-
tion, Texas). The SEs for all estimates
were obtained using the Taylor series
(linearization) method following
NHANES recommended procedures
and weights.16-18 Estimates and SEs were
obtained for each survey period. Com-
parisons across surveys and 95% con-
fidence interval (CI) estimates for CKD
stages incorporating persistence data on
microalbuminuria were made using
bootstrap methods implemented in
Stata. Adjustment was conducted using
the direct method for age and logistic
regression for multiple variables. Esti-
mates from this study are nationally rep-
resentative of the noninstitutionalized
US population of adults aged 20 years
or older. Prevalence estimates were ap-
plied to the 2000 US census to obtain
estimates of the number of individu-
als with CKD in the United States in the
year 2000. In hypothesis testing, a P
value of less than .05 was the level of
significance used in this study.
A sensitivity analysis (conservative
trends analysis) was conducted by ad-
justing serum creatinine so its mean
level in a young healthy subgroup was
identical between the 1988-1994 and
1999-2004 surveys. The goal of this
analysis was to determine if differ-
ences in mean serum creatinine across
surveys (potentially indicating a re-
sidual laboratory calibration differ-
ence) might explain some or all of the
changes in the prevalence of CKD.
Among 8728 participants aged 20 to 39
years without diagnosed hypertension
or diabetes, the weighted mean stan-
dardized serum creatinine levels were
0.04 mg/dL (to convert to µmol/L, mul-
tiply by 88.4) lower in 1988-1994 than
in 1999-2004 (P.001). In the con-
servative trends analysis, this value was
added to the 1988-1994 data to make
the mean value in the young healthy
group identical across surveys. The later
surveys were chosen as the reference
group because their creatinine assay
yielded unbiased results compared with
reference methods.11
RESULTS
NHANES 1988-1994 included 15 488
participants and NHANES 1999-2004
included 13 233 participants aged 20
years or older examined at the mobile
examination center with an estimated
GFR of at least 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.
During the period between the sur-
veys, the US population became older
and included a smaller proportion of
non-Hispanic whites (TABLE 1). The
shift in age distribution was less pro-
nounced in individuals older than 60
years in which CKD is more common.
At the same time, the prevalence of self-
reported diabetes and hypertension in-
creased as did the mean BMI and pro-
portion of the population that is
overweight and obese, which are all risk
factors for CKD.
Mean albuminuria increased across
the surveys but mean albumin-to-
creatinine ratio was not different among
young healthy individuals (12.2 mg/g
in 1988-1994 and 12.3 mg/g in 1999-
2004). The mean serum creatinine con-
centration was higher in 1999-2004
compared with 1988-1994, correspond-
ing to a lower mean estimated GFR in
1999-2004. The conservative trends
analysis, which added 0.04 mg/dL to the
serum creatinine concentration in
NHANES 1988-1994, resulted in nearly
identical mean serum creatinine con-
centrations and mean estimated GFRs
across surveys.

The inset in panel A shows the higher range of albuminuria in greater detail. Panel B includes data on GFR estimated from a conservative trends analysis in which 0.04
mg/dL was added to serum creatinine to eliminate the difference in mean GFR between surveys. The vertical line in panel B demarcates an estimated GFR of 60
mL/min/1.73 m2, which defines decreased GFR. For both panels, the statistical testing is done for the overall mean and for meaningful categories (ie, estimated GFR
60 and albumin to creatinine ratio 30). NHANES indicates National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.

GFR (panel B) in the 2 surveys. The dis-
tribution of albumin to creatinine ra-
tio is skewed in both surveys. There is
a somewhat higher prevalence of albu-
minuria during 1999-2004 compared
with 1988-1994 in the ranges of 35 to
49 mg/g and 300 mg/g or higher (panel
A). The distribution of estimated GFR
is more symmetric with a higher preva-
lence of values below 60 mL/min/1.73
m2 in 1999-2004 than in 1988-1994.
The conservative trends analysis aligns
the mean estimated GFR across sur-
veys with implications for subsequent
sensitivity analyses.
The proportion of the US popula-
tion with mild, moderate, or severely
reduced estimated GFR increased from
1988-1994 to 1999-2004 (TABLE 2).
The combined prevalence estimate for
1999-2004 had similar precision to the
1988-1994 estimate while prevalence
estimates from each of the three 2-year
surveys had relatively wide 95% CIs.
Moderately reduced GFR increased in
prevalence from 5.4% to 7.7%
(P.001) and the prevalence of se-
verely reduced GFR increased from
0.21% to 0.35% (P=.02; Table 2). Simi-
larly, the proportion of the overall
population with microalbuminuria on
a single occasion increased from 7.1%
to 8.2% (P=.01). The prevalence of
macroalbuminuria increased some-
what from 1.1% to 1.3% but this dif-
ference was well within the limits of
random variation (P=.37). Subdivid-
ing the prevalence of albuminuria by
different levels of estimated GFR
showed that the prevalence of micro-
albuminuria increased significantly
among individuals with normal esti-
mated GFR while all other subgroups
showed no significant increase or de-
crease in albuminuria.
The prevalence estimate for each
stage of CKD was higher in 1999-
2004 than in 1988-1994 with the dif-
ference being statistically significant for
CKD stages 2 through 4 and overall
(TABLE 3). Stratified analyses by sex and

1.73 m2 were all between 1.4 and 1.5
and statistically significant in men,
women, non-Hispanic whites and
blacks, and Mexican Americans with a
somewhat weaker association in the
smaller number of individuals of other
ethnicity.
Trends over time were also similar
within age categories, indicating the
trends were not due to age differences in
the population (FIGURE 2). In both
NHANES surveys, the prevalence of
CKD increased with age with stages 1
and 2 increasing from 2% to 3% at age
20 to 39 years to 9% to 10% after the
age of 70 years. The prevalence of stage
1 alone did not increase with age be-
cause an increasing prevalence of al-
buminuria was offset by a decreasing
proportion of individuals with a GFR
of 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 or higher. The
prevalences for stage 3 and 4 com-
bined were 0.2% in 1988-1994 and
0.7% in 1999-2004 at aged 20 to 39
years compared with 27.8% in 1988-
1994 and 37.8% in 1999-2004 after the
age of 70 years. The dramatic increase
in prevalence is consistent with the
known decline of measured GFR with
age.23 At each age, the prevalence of de-
creased GFR was higher in the 1999-
2004 survey than in the 1988-1994 sur-
vey (P.05 for ages 20-39, 40-59, and
70 years).
Differences in prevalence of de-
creased GFR and albuminuria between
1988-1994 and 1999-2004 remain sub-
stantial after adjustment for changes in
the age, sex, and race/ethnic composi-
tion of the US population during this pe-
riod (TABLE 4). The higher prevalence
ofdiagnoseddiabetes,hypertension,and
higherBMIexplainedsomeofthehigher
prevalence. For albuminuria trends, the
higher prevalence was partly explained
by the older age and high proportion of
minoritygroups(ORdeclinedfrom1.18
to 1.12 after adjustment). Further ad-
justment for the higher prevalence of di-
agnosed diabetes and hypertension and
higher BMI explained practically all of
the difference (OR declined to 1.03). In
the fully adjusted models, the preva-
lence of albuminuria was strongly asso-
ciatedwithdiagnoseddiabetes(OR,3.58;
95% CI, 3.12-4.12) and hypertension
(OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.10-1.92) as well as
older age and all race/ethnicity groups
other than non-Hispanic whites
(P.001) but not higher BMI (P=.12).
The prevalence OR of estimated GFR of
less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 1999-
2004 compared with 1988-1994 was
1.47. Age adjustment had little impact,
likely because the increase in the num-
ber of older individuals was offset by a

mainrelativelyunchanged(Table1).The
prevalence OR increased further to 1.53
after adjustment for age, sex, and race
due to the lower prevalence of de-
creased GFR among minority groups.
The OR decreased to 1.43 with addi-
tional adjustment for diagnosed diabe-
tes, hypertension, and BMI. In the fully
adjusted model, the prevalence of low
GFR was strongly associated with diag-
nosed diabetes (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.28-
1.80) and hypertension (OR, 1.98; 95%

The conservative trends analysis
showed that the difference in mean se-
rum creatinine concentration be-
tween surveys accounts for much but
possibly not all of the higher preva-
lence of lower GFR in 1999-2004. In
this analysis, the prevalence of CKD in
1988-1994 was higher (1.5 for stage 1,
2.8 for stage 2, 6.7 for stage 3, and 0.23
for stage 4 for a total of 11.3). The
prevalence OR of estimated GFR less
than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was 1.17 (95%
CI, 1.02-1.34). After full adjustment in
the conservative trends analysis, the
prevalence OR of decreased GFR be-
tween surveys was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.94-
1.24), indicating that the differences in
mean serum creatinine concentration,
demographics, diagnosed diabetes, hy-
pertension, and BMI between surveys
explain nearly all of the difference in
prevalence of low GFR between 1988-
1994 and 1999-2004 (P=.27).

COMMENT
Analysis of survey data from a represen-
tativesampleoftheUSpopulationshows
that the prevalence rate of CKD is high.
Estimates from 1999-2004 are higher
than those in 1988-1994, which re-
flected an increase in microalbumin-
uria as well as an increase in the preva-
lenceofmoderatelyandseverelyreduced
estimated GFR. Overall, the preva-
lence rate of CKD increased from 10.0%
(95% CI, 9.1-10.9) to 13.1% (95% CI,
12.0-14.1). This increase was only
slightly explained by the aging of the US
population because the age-adjusted
prevalence estimate of CKD stages 1
through4onlyincreasedto10.3%when
the 1988-1994 prevalence was ad-
justed to the 1999-2004 age structure.
The increased prevalence of diagnosed
diabetes and hypertension and obesity
explained some of the increase in preva-
lence. In contrast, these factors ex-
plained the entire increase in the preva-
lenceofalbuminuria.AwarenessofCKD
remains very low, even among individu-
als with both reduced kidney function
and albuminuria. The estimated num-
ber of individuals with CKD increased
even more dramatically because of the
growth in the US population aged 20
years or older from 178 million in 1990
to 197 million in 2000.
The increase in prevalence of CKD
is partly explained by the increase in a
number of CKD risk factors, includ-
ing an aging US population and an in-
crease in the proportion of individuals
with obesity, diagnosed diabetes, and
hypertension.5,24,25 The proportion of

minority populations has also in-
creased although the prevalence of CKD
in these populations in NHANES is not
higher than that in non-Hispanic
whites. This lower CKD prevalence
amongethnicminoritiescomparedwith
whites is in contrast to the higher di-
alysis rates in these groups and re-
mains unexplained. One explanation
could be that the MDRD Study equa-
tion performs differently in various eth-
nic and racial groups. Mexican Ameri-
cans and Native Americans in particular
were not represented in the MDRD
Study in which the equation was de-
veloped. Nonetheless, the MDRD Study
equation was validated in 5504 indi-
viduals and showed little bias among
blacks.26 An underestimate in whites
and women may explain some of the
higher prevalence in these groups. It has
been hypothesized that the lower preva-
lence of CKD among blacks could be
due to hyperfiltration and faster pro-
gression through CKD stage 3.10,27 How-
ever, differential errors in GFR estima-
tion cannot be ruled out. Studies
measuring GFR in population-based
samples of individuals of different eth-
nicities and ages are needed. Adjust-
ment for all risk factors explained nearly
the entire increase in the prevalence of
albuminuria but only a fraction of the
increase in the prevalence of low esti-
mated GFR (Table 4). This is partly ex-
plained by the stronger association of
diabetes with albuminuria compared
with low GFR. In addition, albumin-
uria and low GFR show opposite asso-
ciations with non-Hispanic black and
Mexican American race/ethnicity.
The CKD prevalence estimates re-
ported herein are higher than those re-
ported previously. For 1988-1994, the
prevalence based on the recent
calibration to standard serum creati-
nine concentration is 10.0% com-
pared with a prevalence of 8.8% re-
ported previously using the same
criteria. This difference is the result of
a difference between the initial calibra-
tion of serum creatinine concentra-
tion to the MDRD Study Beckman Syn-
chron CX3 method for assaying
creatinine and the most recent calibra-
tion to the Roche Enzymatic method.28
The new calibration resulted in higher
values in the 1988-1994 and 1999-
2000 surveys (0.05 and 0.10 mg/dL, re-
spectively, at 1.0 mg/dL).11 The previ-
ous calibration of the 1999-2000 survey
was conducted during a single month
of the survey rather than a random
sample of specimens from throughout
the survey period. Thus, only recently
has there been data from a panel of
masked frozen specimens from each
survey analyzed at a single laboratory
to provide a direct comparison of se-
rum creatinine concentration across all
of the surveys. The high correlation be-
tween the original creatinine mea-
sures and the assays performed for cali-
bration (r=0.98 for 1988-1994, r=0.98
for 1999-2000, r=0.98 for 2001-2002,
and r=0.99 for 2003-2004) lends sup-
port to our ability to make reliable com-
parisons. The prevalence estimates pre-
sented herein differ from those in a
recent brief report,29 which also ana-
lyzed NHANES data, for 3 main rea-
sons: we estimated CKD stage 1 or 2
based on persistent albuminuria rather
than counting all individuals with mi-
croalbuminuria; we used the MDRD
Study equation expressed in standard
creatinine because it corresponds to the
calibration of NHANES serum creati-
nine concentration to standard creati-
nine; and we also estimated the effect
of a conservative trends analysis, which
indicates much of the change in the
prevalence of CKD is related to a subtle
but influential difference in the esti-
mate mean serum creatinine concen-
tration of the population.
Despite an updated laboratory cali-
bration traceable to criterion standard
reference methods using a random
sample of specimens from each
NHANES survey, small residual differ-
ences in laboratory measurements
across surveys cannot be ruled out. In-
creased muscle mass or increased pro-
tein intake could also have increased the
mean serum creatinine concentration.
Laboratory or non­kidney-related ef-
fects on serum creatinine concentra-
tion were of particular concern be-
cause there was a higher mean standard
serum creatinine concentration in the
1999-2004 survey compared with the
1988-1994 survey, even among young
participants without diagnosed diabe-
tes or hypertension. The persistence of
the increase in CKD prevalence from
1988-1994 to 1999-2004 even after
equalizing the mean serum creatinine
concentration in a conservative trends
analysis supports the conclusion that
the increase in CKD prevalence is real.
However, CKD prevalence estimates are
sensitive to small differences in serum
creatinine concentration and the mag-
nitude of the increase in prevalence
could be smaller than that suggested by
a simple comparison across surveys.
The new data on trends in CKD pro-
vide a larger context for trends in kid-
ney failure treated by dialysis and trans-
plantation. The age- and sex-adjusted
incidence of end-stage renal disease in
the United States increased 42% be-
tween 1991 and 2001. During this time,
there has been a consistent slowing in
the rate of growth of treated kidney fail-
ure rates from greater than 10% per year
in the 1980s to a decrease of 1.1% be-
tween 2002 and 2004. However, the
2004 rate of 339 per million is still far
higher than the Healthy People 2010
goal of 217 per million population.4
Furthermore, models of the treated kid-
ney failure epidemic suggest that even
with adjusted rates leveling off, the
growing prevalence of diabetes and the
aging of the population will result in a
progressive increase in the number of
patients treated for kidney failure. It is
estimated that by 2015 there will be
136 000 patients with incident end-
stage renal disease per year and 712 000
patients with prevalent disease.30 Our
analysis suggests that the increasing
prevalence of diabetes is already lead-
ing to a measurable increase in the ear-
lier stages of CKD (stages 1-4).
Interpretation of the high preva-
lence of CKD in the US population
should take into account its wide spec-
trum of disease severity, etiology, and
comorbid conditions. Within CKD
stages 1 and 2, persistent microalbu-
minuria outnumbers macroalbumin-
uria approximately 9 to 1. Although al-

buminuria is the strongest risk factor
for CKD progression, it is also associ-
ated with an increased risk of cardio-
vascular morbidity and mortality.13
Chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4
are marked by complications of re-
duced GFR. Chronic kidney disease
stage 3 outnumbers CKD stage 4 ap-
proximately 20 to 1; within stage 3, the
upper half of estimated GFR outnum-
bers the lower half by 3 to 1. In one
study,13 CKD stage 4 was associated
with a 17.6% risk of progression to kid-
ney failure and a 45.7% mortality risk
during a mean follow-up of 3 years. By
contrast, in CKD stage 3, the risk for
progression to kidney failure was 1.1%
but the mortality risk was 24.3% com-
pared with 0.07% and 10.2%, respec-
tively, in patients without CKD. Bet-
ter data are needed to allow physicians
to combine information on estimated
GFR, albuminuria, and other clinical
characteristics to predict kidney dis-
ease progression, complications of re-
duced GFR and cardiovascular dis-
ease, as well as to establish the balance
of risks and benefits for the treatment
of different patient subgroups with
CKD.
This study has a number of limita-
tions including reliance on estimation
of GFR, rather than direct measure-
ment using injection of an exogenous
marker. Equations for estimating GFR
have limited precision compared with
measured GFR. Imprecision and bias
are greater at higher GFR, limiting the
accuracy of classification in the mildly
decreased GFR group.26,31 In addition,
systematic differences between the mea-
sured and estimated GFR may be in-
fluenced by the population in which the
equation is applied.31,32 Such a bias
might contribute to racial/ethnic dif-
ferences in prevalence estimates, but
any systematic difference would apply
to all of the NHANES surveys and
would be unlikely to affect the trends
reported herein. The persistence of al-
buminuria was estimated based on lim-
ited data and assumed to be the same
across surveys, age, and other sub-
groups. The data are not sufficient to
test this assumption. However, by as-
suming the same persistence in the dif-
ferent surveys, the trends observed can-
not be the result of changes in estimated
persistence rate of microalbuminuria.
Differential nonresponse, particularly
lower response among sicker individu-
als, could have biased the present preva-
lence estimates. This bias may be most
plausible for the more advanced stages
of CKD and thus, the prevalence of
CKD stage 4 may be underestimated
among individuals who volunteered to
participate in NHANES. In addition,
both NHANES surveys only sampled
noninstitutionalized adults. Chronic
kidney disease prevalence in nursing
homes and its trends over time is un-
known but likely to be high. In 2000,
1.6 million (4.5%) adults older than age
65 years were in nursing homes.33
In conclusion, survey data suggest
that the prevalence of CKD in the
United States is high and has in-
creased between 1988-1994 and 1999-
2004, from 10% to 13%, while aware-
ness of kidney disease among the
general public remains very low. The
increasing prevalence of diagnosed dia-
betes and hypertension has contrib-
uted to this increase, which may propa-
gatetohigherratesofcomplicationsand
kidney failure requiring dialysis or
transplantation. Earlier stages ac-
counted for most of the individuals with
CKD. Because individuals with early
stages of CKD have a higher risk of car-
diovascular disease morbidity and mor-
tality than their risk of progression to
kidney failure, cardiovascular risk fac-
tor management in this group is criti-
cal. The high prevalence of CKD over-
all, and particularly among older
individuals and persons with hyper-
tension and diabetes, suggests that CKD
needs to be a central part of future pub-
lic health planning.

Role of the Sponsor: Two of the coauthors, Drs Kusek
and Eggers, are employees of the National Institute
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kid-
ney Diseases had no input into the data collection, con-
duct, or management of the study. The National In-
stitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
staff commented on the analysis, interpretation of the
data, preparation, and review; and approved the manu-
script. The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Surveys were conducted by the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
Previous Presentation: This study was presented in part
at the American Society of Nephrology; November 2,
