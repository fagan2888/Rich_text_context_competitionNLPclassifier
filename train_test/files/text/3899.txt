Introduction
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents a clonal disor-
der of hematological stem cells containing a constitutively
active tyrosine kinase known as BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL
confers cells with a survival advantage due to the continu-
ous activation of many downstream signaling pathways
including the signal transducer and activator transcription
(STAT) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways,
rendering cells resistant to apoptosis.
The PI3Ks are a family oflipid kinases that catalyze the
phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the 30-hydroxyl
group. A critical product of this reaction is phosphatidylino-
sitol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a vital second messenger,
which recruits downstream signaling proteins including
AKT and the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1
(PDK1).1Earlier studies have indicated that the treatment of
cells with emodin negatively affects the PI3K/AKT signal-
ing cascade.2 The PI3K signal transduction pathway has
been investigated extensively for its role in oncogenic
transformation and in the prevention of apoptosis.3-5 The
fact that AKT overexpression is found in many human
cancers, that active AKT promotes resistance to chemo- and
radiotherapy, and that AKT activity is sufficient to block
apoptosis induced by a number of death stimuli has resulted
in intensive studies on the role of AKT as a mediator of the
PI3K survival signal. These observations suggest that the
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway might be therapeuti-
cally important for cancer patients.
Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is a
natural anthraquinone derivative isolated from Rheum pal-
matum L. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that
emodin possesses various biological functions, such as anti-
bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer, and is a potent
inhibitor of casein kinase 2. Previous studies have
demonstrated that emodin inhibits cell growth in several

Abstract
The BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, is the front-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia, but the
emergence of imatinib resistance has led to the search for alternative drug treatments. There is a pressing need, therefore,
to develop and test novel drugs. Natural products including plants, microorganisms, and halobios provide rich resources
for discovery of anticancer drugs. In this article, we demonstrate that emodin inhibited the growth of K562 cells harboring
BCR-ABL in vitro and in vivo, and induced abundant apoptosis, which was correlated with the inhibition of PETN/PI3K/
Akt level and deletion of BCR-ABL. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising agent to kill K562 cells harboring
BCR-ABL.

types of tumor cells.6-10 But no research has been carried out
to investigate the effect of emodin on K562 cells.
In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms
of emodin on K562 leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. The
results demonstrated that emodin can trigger apoptosis
through the inhibition of PI3K/AKT level, upregulating the
expression of PTEN and deleting BCR-ABL.
Materials and Methods
Reagents and Antibodies
Emodin (purity >98%) was purchased from Calbiochem Inc
(San Diego, CA) and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO; Sigma, Shanghai, China). Antibodies against
c-ABL (C-19), PI3K, AKT, and PTEN were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal
antibody against actin was from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis,
MO).Anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and anti-rabbit immu-
noglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies
were from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL). Trizol
reagent was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
Cell Culture
Chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells were obtained from
the Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry & Cell
Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and grown in
RPMI1640 culture medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) contain-
ing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 100 U/mL
benzyl penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin in a regular
CO2
incubator at 37°C.
Cell Viability Assay
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro-
mide (MTT; Sigma) was used to determine cell survival in
a quantitative colorimetric assay. Cells were plated in
96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to attach for 24
hours. Cells were then incubated with fresh medium con-
taining 25, 50, or 100 µmol/L of emodin for 24, 48, and 72
hours, respectively. Twenty microliters of MTT (5 mg/mL)
was added to the culture medium 4 hours before harvesting.
The medium was then aspirated carefully without disturb-
ing the blue formazan crystals. Then 150 µL DMSO was
added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals while
slightly agitating the cells on an automated shaker. The
absorbance of the suspension was measured spectrophoto-
metrically at 490 nm by a Benchmark microtiter plate reader
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The results were
expressed as a percentage of the absorbance present in
treated cells compared to control cells. Cell growth inhibi-
tion rate (%) was calculated using the following equation:
survival ratio (%) = (1 -Atreatment
/Acontrol
) × 100%.
Assessment of Cell Morphological Changes
To detect morphological evidence of apoptosis, K562 cells
were seeded in 50-mL culture bottles (5 × 105 cells/bottle)
and then incubated with fresh medium containing 50 µmol/L
of emodin for 48 hours. Morphology of K562 cells was first
observed under light microscope (DIAPHOT300, Nikon,
Tokyo, Japan). The K562 cells were then collected, fixed
with 4% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded with
epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections of 60 nm were prepared for
electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of K562 cells was
observed under transmission electron microscope
(JEM2000, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 100 kV.
Cell Cycle Analysis
K562 cells (1 × 105 cells/mL) were seeded in 6-well
plates and cultured with 0.1% DMSO or emodin (25, 50,
100 µmol/L) for 48 hours. Cells treated were harvested,
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed
with 66% ethanol overnight. Cells were centrifuged and
washed with PBS, then stained with 50 mg/mL propid-
ium iodide (PI) and 2.5 mg/mL RNase in PBS solution
for 30 minutes at room temperature. DNA content was
analyzed by flow cytometry at the emission wavelength
of 488 nm.
Apoptotic Cell Determination by Annexin V/PI
Staining Assay
Cells were treated with drugs (25, 50, 100 µmol/L emodin)
for 48 hours and apoptotic rates were assessed with flow
cytometry using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(Annexin V-FITC)/PI kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA). Samples were prepared according to the manufactur-
er's instruction and analyzed by flow cytometry on FACS
Calibur (Becton Dickson, San Diego, CA).
Apoptotic Cell Determination by DNA
Fragmentation Assay
K562 cells (5×104 cells) treated with the 25, 50, 100 µmol/L
emodin for 48 hours were suspended in 100 µL of 10 mM
Tris-HCl and 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA; pH 8.0). The cells were then treated with 100 mL of
a solution that contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 20 mg/mL
proteinase K. The mixture was then incubated at 37°C fol-
lowed by DNA extraction with phenol/chloroform. DNA
fragmentation analysis was done with 10 mg DNA prepared
from control cells, and cells were treatedwith 25, 50, 100
µmol/L emodin for 48 hours.DNA laddering was analyzed
using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide
staining.

Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR)
Expression of the BCR-ABL, PI3K, AKT, and PTEN was
monitored by RT-PCR. K562 cells (5×104 cells) were
treated with 25, 50, and 100 µmol/L emodin for 48 hours.
After treatment, cells were lysed with 1 mL of RNAse-clean
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then the sam-
ples were processed according to the manufacturer's proto-
col to obtain total cellular RNA. Total cDNAs were
synthesized by ThermoScript RT-PCRsystem (Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Inc, Carlsbad, CA) and 0.2 µg of total
RNA was primed with random hexamers. cDNA amplifica-
tion was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C
for 4 minutes; followed by denaturation at 94°C for 1 min-
ute, annealing at 55°C for 50 seconds, extension at 72°C for
90 seconds for 30 cycles, followed by a final extension at
72°C for 5 minutes. For -actin amplification, there were a
total of 20 PCR cycles. The PCR products were electropho-
resed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with
ethidium bromide. The sequences for BCR-ABL sense and
antisense primers were 5-TG GTG GGC CTC TCA GTG
TCT TA-3and 5-TCG GTA GCG CAG GCA GTA GTT
C-3. The sequences for PI3K sense and antisense primers
were 5-A TGC TTC CTG GGG ATA AT-3and 5-TCA
AAG GCA CGG ATA ACT-3. The sequences for AKT
sense and antisense primers were 5-CCC ATC ATT GCA
ATA GCA GG-3and 5-GTT CAA ACT TCT GCT CCT
GA-3; -actin was used as an internal control. The
sequences for -actin sense and antisense primers were 5-
TGG GGA AGG TGA AGG TCG G-3and 5-CTG GAA
GAT GG TGA TGG GA-3.
Protein Preparation and Western Blot Analysis
K562 cells were treated without or with indicated concen-
tration of emodin for 48 hours. After treatment, the cells
were harvested for total protein extraction. Protein con-
centration was then determined using the Bradford
method. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of pro-
tein were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels
were equilibrated in transfer buffer (50 mM Tris, 40 mM
glycine, 0.375% SDS, and 20% methanol) and electro-
phoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore).
The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and
0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4°C with spe-
cific primary antibodies at 1:500 dilution (antibodies
against c-ABL [C-19], PI3K, AKT, and PTEN). After
washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with
horseradish peroxidase­conjugated secondary antibodies
at 1:1000 dilutions for 1 hour. The proteins were then
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detec-
tion kit (ECL kit, GE Healthcare).
Nude Mouse Xenograft Model
BALB/c nude mice were bred at the animal facility of Chong
Qing Medical University. The mice were housed in barrier
facilities with a 12-hour light-dark cycle, with food and water
available ad libitum. Transplantable tumors (induced by K562
cells subcutaneous inoculation of a mixture of 2 × 107 actively
growing K562 cells in 100 µL PBS and 100 µL of matrigel to
the dorsal side of each nude mouse) were chopped into frag-
ments (about 1.5 mm3), each of which was transplanted into
the right or left axillary fossa of 25 nude mice. Palpable
tumors of volume 100 to 200 mm3 were developed after 12
days and the mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (with
5 mice per group): negative control group; emodin 25, 50, 100
mg/kg groups and HU120mg/kggroup. The negative control
group received 0.9% normal saline containing 1% DMSO.All
of these drugs were injected intraperitoneally every day up to
12 days. Tumor size was measured once every 2 days in 2
perpendiculars, and tumor volume (TV) was calculated using
the formula: (ab2)/2, where a and b refer to the longer and
shorter dimensions, respectively. The body weight of the ani-
mals was measured 3 times a week at the same time as the
tumor dimension measurement and the mortality was moni-
tored daily. The tumor growth inhibition rate was calculated
using the following formula: inhibition rate (%) = (mean
tumor weight of negative control group - mean tumor weight
of treatment group)/mean tumor weight of negative control
group. This experiment was conducted in accordance with the
guideline issued by the State Food and Drug Administration
(SFDA of China). The animals were housed and cared in
accordance with the guidelines established by the National
Science Council of Republic China.
Histopathological Analysis
Tumor tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin
embedded, cut into 4-µm sections that were placed on glass
slides, stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and these sections
were reviewed under optical microscope.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Analysis of K562 Cell Apoptosis In Vivo
TEM studies were performed as described earlier.11 In brief,
small pieces of tumor tissue (1 mm3) from control and treated
mice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaral-
dehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 hours
at room temperature (24°C).This was followed by washing the
tissue pieces in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and
then placing them in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 hours at room temperature.
Dehydration was done in an ascending grade of ethanol, fol-
lowed by embedding in Epon 812 and polymerization at 60°C
for 48 hours. Ultrathin sections (50-70 nm) were obtained
Wang et al 529
using an Ultracut Ultra microtome (Leica Microsystems
GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and picked up onto 200-mesh cop-
per grids. The sections were double stained with uranyl acetate
and lead citrate, and then analyzed under an FEI Tecnai-12
twin transmission electron microscope equipped with an SIS
Mega View II CCD camera at 80 kV (FEI Co, Hillsboro, OR).
Western Blot Analysis In Vivo
A total of 100 to 150 mg tumor specimens were washed in
PBS and minced into small pieces using bistouries. Tissue
samples were suspended in 1 mL of cold homogenizing buf-
fer and homogenized in an ice-cold grinder. Then the
homogenate was centrifuged at 12000 ×gfor 15 minutes at
4°C. The concentration of total proteins was measured
using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL).The
next steps are in line with the aforementioned.
RT-PCR Analysis In Vivo
A total of 100 mg tumor specimens from every treated
group was homogenated. Total RNA was isolated from
homogenate using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). The next steps are in line with the aforementioned.
Statistical Analysis
In vitro, all experiments were performed at least 3 times, and
results are expressed as mean ± standard error (SE), unless
otherwise stated. GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis.
Comparisons between 2 groups involved 2-sided Student's
ttest, and comparisons among multiple groups involved 1-way
ANOVA with post hoc intergroup comparison using Tukey
test. P< .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Emodin Inhibits K562 Cell Viability In Vitro
To investigate the inhibitory effect of emodin on K562
cells, MTT assay was used to quantify the effect of emodin
on K562 cell growth. Through pre-experiment, we deter-
mined the time interval in the MTT experiment (data not
shown). As shown in Figure 1A and B, emodin caused a
decrease of cell viability in K562 cells in a dose- and time-
dependent manner when compared with the control. DMSO
alone showed no effect on viability of K562 cells.
Emodin Induces K562 Cell Division Cycle Arrest
at G0
/G1
Phase In Vitro
The inhibition by emodin of cell growth was further
investigated with flow cytometric analysis of cellular
DNA content. As shown in Figure 2A and B, the number
of cells in the G1
phase was increased after treatment with
25, 50, and 100 µmol/L of emodin for 24 hours. The per-
centage of cells in the G1
phase was 57.2% in control,
whereas it was increased to 66% to 82% after treatment
with 25, 50, and 100 µmol/L of emodin for 24 hours. We
also observed that the cells in the S phase decreased while
the concentration of emodin increased. More important,
we noted a significant decrease of cells in the S phase
after treated with 50 µmol/L of emodin. As shown in
Figure 2B, emodin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibi-
tion of cell cycle. These results suggested that emodin
had a prominent ability to inhibit the cell cycle and cause
cell cycle arrest at the G0
/G1
phase.
Emodin Causes K562 Cell Morphological
Changes In Vitro
Under control conditions, the untreated K562 cells grew well
and the skeletons were clear. The cells appeared in a normal
circular shape and the nucleoli were evident when observed
under optic microscope (Figure 3A) and electron microscope
(Figure 3C).After treatment with 40 µmol/Lof emodin for 48

hours, the cell volume reduced, cells shrank, nuclear pykno-
sis was observed, a decreased cell density was noticed, and
the apoptotic body appeared (Figure 3B). In addition,
morphological characteristics of apoptosis including cellular
shrinkage, chromatin margination, condensation, and vacuol-
ization were observed under electron microscope (Figure 3D).

Emodin Induces K562 Cell Apoptosis In Vitro
The deregulation of cell cycle has been reported to correlate
with the induction of apoptosis. Based on the appearance of
the sub-G1
peak in cell cycle analysis, we further character-
ized the emodin-induced apoptosis by Annexin V/PI dual
staining. This assay divided apoptotic cells into 2 stages:
early (Annexin V+/PI-) and late apoptotic/necrotic
(Annexin V+/PI+). As shown in Figure 4A, Annexin V/PI
double-parameter method is a sensitive detection method
for apoptosis. The cells stained mainly by Annexin V-FITC
were regarded as the early apoptotic cells. Early apoptosis
occurred in K562 cells treated with 25, 50, and 100 µmol/L
emodin for 12 hours, and a concentration gradient was
shown. The apoptosis rates of treated groups were 8.89%,
22.95%, and 36.06%, respectively; the control group was
2.09% (Figure 4B). There were statistically significant dif-
ferences between the treated groups and the control group
(P < .001). In an attempt to further clarify the mechanisms
underlying the inhibitory action of emodin on leukemia
cells, its effect in the induction of apoptosis on human
chronic myelocytic leukemia K562 cells was determined by
DNA fragmentation analysis. Emodin-induced apoptosis
was found at all tested dosages with 48 hours of incubation.
The characteristic apoptotic DNA ladders with multiple
bands were observed in these drug-treated groups, while no
such DNA ladders were detectable in the negative controls
(Figure 5). With increased concentrations of emodin, mul-
tiple bands became more and more clear, which indicated
that apoptosis occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Our
results indicated that emodin inhibited the growth of
K562cells, at least in part, by induction of apoptosis.
Emodin Inhibits Tumor Growth in Nude Mice
The results showed that after 12 days of treatment with
emodin, no significant variation in body weight was
detected (data not shown), suggesting that emodin did not
produce significant nontumor toxicity in tumor-bearing
Figure 3. Morphological changes induced by emodin in K562
cells. K562 cells were seeded in culture bottles and treated
without (A and C) or with 50 µmol/L emodin (B and D) for
48 hours. Apoptotic cells (in B) were characterized by cellular
shrinkage (light microscope, 100×). Under a transmission
electron microscope, the apoptotic cell (in D) was characterized
by marked condensation and margination of chromatin (5000×).

mice. But in the hydroxyurea treatment group, the weight of
nude mice (data not shown) was significantly lower than in
the negative control group, accompanied by the formation
of cachexia. However, the average weight of tumors (Figure
6C) treated with emodin at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg and HU
were 1.02 g, 0.64 g, 0.41 g, and 0.36 g, respectively, versus
1.66 g of negative control tumors, which corresponds to
61.4%, 38.5%, 24.7%, and 21.7% of inhibition (P < .01). In
addition, the tumor volume of tumors treated with emodin
and HU also significantly decreased when compared with
the nontreated group (Figure 6A and B). These results sug-
gest that emodin was able to effectively inhibit tumor
growth in vivo, and no obvious side effects were found.
Effect of Emodin on Transplanted Tumor
Histology
The histopathological changes were observed under optical
microscope. The result showed that a large area of necrosis
located in periphery of tumors was observed in emodin-
treated mice but not in normal saline-treated mice. In normal
saline-treated mice, tumors with normal demarcation revealed
complete cell shapes with clear cytoplasm and typical nuclei.
In contrast, the cell shape was completely destroyed in
necrotic tumor tissue derived from emodin-treated mice
(Figure 7). In the negative control group (Figure 7A), tumor
cells with normal demarcation revealed complete cell shape
with clear cytoplasm and typical nuclei. Tumor cells with
karyomegaly and anacheromasis were observed. Abnormal
division of the nucleus and abundant vessels could also be
found. The tumor cell growth was active. There was a small
amount of necrotic tissue in the central block of tumor. In the
low-dose group (Figure 7B), some cell shape was destroyed in
necrotic tumor tissue, and mitotic tumor cells could be found.
There were significantly more hemorrhage and necrosis than
in the control group. A larger number of tumor cells were
apoptotic. In the medium dose group (Figure 7C), several
macrophages were approaching to and phagocytosing tumor
cells, mitotic figures were seen, and necrosis and hemorrhage
were found more easily than in the low-dose group (Figure
7B). In the high-dose group (Figure 7D), the tumor cells with
abnormal nuclear division decreased; there were some apop-
tosis and necrosis and fewer vessels. A large area of necrosis
was observed easily. Obvious lymphocytic infiltration, deeply
stained cells, and pyknosis were all observed. In the positive
control group (Figure 7E), tumor load decreased; some tumor
cells necrosed and part of these cells were replaced by con-
nective tissue.
Emodin Induces K562 Cell Apoptosis In Vivo
The morphological features of apoptoticK562 cells in vivo
were observed by transmission electron microscopy.
Negative control group (Figure 8A): the normal tumor cells
with abundant euchromatin had large nuclei, and chromatin
margination in the clumped K562 cells was little or none.
TEM studies clearly showed intact mitochondria with the
double membrane clearly visible, cristae structurally intact,
and intramitochondrial matrix consisting of electron-dense
granules. All this indicated rapid cell proliferation. Positive
control hydroxyurea group (Figure 8E): the main changes
of most cells are cellular necrosis, swelling, and heterochro-
matin margination. The cells with irregular membrane were
lumping with apoptotic bodies. Macrophages were begin-
ning to phagocytose tumor cells. Cell microvilli were
reduced or absent; mitochondria and other organelle struc-
ture were unclear; some nuclei were pyknotic or dissolved.
Electron-dense granules ranging from large to small in size
could be seen in some cytoplasm, indicating that cell necro-
sis was serious. In the low concentration emodin treatment
group (Figure 8B), many karyopycnotic cells and a few
with lumping chromatin were found. Chromatin margin-
ation and apoptotic cells were observed. The macrophage
spine enclosed tumor cells. In the middle concentration
emodin treatment group (Figure 8C), cytoplasm condensa-
tion and primary apoptosis were observed. Chromatin mar-
gination and the apoptotic cell became more common, and
the mitochondrial double membrane was absent. The mac-
rophage spine was enclosing the apoptotic body and was
beginning to enclose the tumor cells. In high-concentration
emodin treatment group (Figure 8D), the cell membrane
was destroyed, and obvious karyopycnosis and margination
were observed. Apoptotic bodies formed, and macrophages
began to phagocytose the tumor cells. The expansion of
Figure 5. The effect of emodin on the induction of apoptosis
in K562 cells was determined using DNA fragmentation analysis.
DNA was isolated from the cells and analyzed using 2% agarose
gel electrophoresis with 1 × TBE buffer and ethidium bromide
staining. The apoptotic characteristic laddering pattern of
DNA fragments with multiple bands indicated the induction of
apoptosis in emodin-treated cells at various conditions but not
in the untreated control. Lane M: DNA ladder marker; Lane 1:

µmol/L.

endoplasmic reticulum and some electron-dense granules in
cytoplasm were observed easily. In conclusion, emodin
could result in the apoptosis of K562 cells in a dose-depen-
dent manner in vivo.
Emodin Decreased the BCR-ABL Level
To address the mechanism of the emodin-mediated growth inhi-
bition in CML cells, we analyzed the expression of BCR-ABL
in CML cells treated with or without emodin by RT-PCR and
Western blotting. Our study showed emodin dose-dependently
decreased BCR-ABL level in vitro and in vivo (Figures 9-11).
Emodin Inhibits PI3K/AKT Level
Emodin inhibited the PI3K/AKT level, which correlated with
the enhancement of emodin-induced apoptosis.AKT has been
described as a downstream effector of PI3K in a number of
models that involve activation of PI3K in survival signaling.
We investigated whether AKT could be inactivated in K562
cells in response to emodin. To demonstrate that emodin
induced apoptosis by repressing the PI3K/AKT survival path-
way, we measured levels of PI3K and AKT by RT-PCR and
Western blotting.As shown in Figures 9 to 11, emodin caused
a decrease of PI3K and AKT in a dose-dependent manner
Emodin Upgraded PI3K-AKT Signaling Upstream
of PTEN Gene
The tumor suppressor PTEN was originally identified as a
negative regulator of PI3K signaling, a main regulator of cell
growth, metabolism, and survival. Yet this function of PTEN
is extremely relevant for its tumor-suppressive ability, albeit
the recent characterization of many PI3K-independent

tumor-suppressive activities. The phosphatase and tensin
homolog deletion on chromosome PTEN was originally dis-
covered as a candidate tumor suppressor, mutated and lost in
various cancers.12,13 The major function of PTEN is the buff-
ering of PI3K signaling. The loss and mutation of PTEN in
various cancers lead to hyperactive PI3K signaling. PTEN is
a main player in the regulation of PI3K signaling. As shown
in Figures 9 to 11, our study showed emodin dose-depend-
ently upgraded PTEN level in vitro and in vivo.
Discussion
The search for new chemopreventive and antitumor agents
that are more effective and less toxic has stimulated great
interest in phytochemicals. Emodin, a natural anthraqui-
none derivative isolated from Rheum palmatum L, is one
such compound. Results of the present study provided evi-
dence to indicate that emodin exhibited antitumor activity
in K562 cells in vitro and in vivo through apoptosis induc-
tion. The mechanism was via inactivating PTEN/PI3K-
AKT and deleting BCR-ABL
Although emodin exhibited very potent cytotoxicity
toward K562 cell line by MTT, it did not exhibit very potent
cytotoxicity toward normal human embryonic kidney 293
cells (data not shown), suggesting its tumor-selectivegrowth
inhibitory effect. The results from animal experiments
showed that after 12 days of treatment with emodin, no sig-
nificant variation in body weight was detected (data not

shown), suggesting that emodin did not produce significant
nontumor toxicity in tumor-bearing mice. But in the
hydroxyurea treatment group, the weight of nude mice (data
not shown) was significantly lower than in the negative
control group, accompanied by the formation of cachexia.
All these results show that emodin is a potentially powerful
anticancer drug with low toxicity and very few side effects.
The poor prognostic outcome of CML is due to its resis-
tance to current therapies, maintaining it as a leading cause
of cancer-related death. Successful treatment with chemo-
therapeutic agents is largely dependent on their ability to
trigger cell death in tumor cells. Therefore, novel inducers
of apoptosis provide a new therapeutic approach for anti-
cancer design. Several previous studies have demonstrated
that emodin exerts antitumorigenic activity by inducing
apoptosis in cancer cells,14-19 and sensitizes prostate cancer
cells and gallbladder cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
agents.20,21 Apoptosis is an important way to maintain cel-
lular homeostasis between cell division and cell death.22
Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is char-
acterized by a variety of morphological features, including
changes in the plasma membrane such as loss of membrane
asymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, chromatin con-
densation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation, so induc-
tion of apoptosis in cancer cells is one of the useful strategies
for anticancer drug development.23 In this respect, many
studies were performed for screening of apoptosis inducing
compounds from plants.24-26 In the present study, we found
that emodin showed significant antiproliferative activity
and induction of apoptosis in K562 cells. We demonstrated
the inhibition of proliferation of K562 cell growth in vivo
with a corresponding reduction the tumor volume and
weight of xenografted tumor in nude nice with emodin
treatment. Preliminarily, we tested the role of emodin in
induction of apoptosis by observing cellular morphology
such as nuclear condensation, fragmentation of genomic
DNA, and Annexin-V binding. Consistent with other stud-
ies, our results showed that there was an induction of apop-
tosis in K562 cells with emodin treatment. Induction of
apoptosis and/or cell proliferation inhibition is highly cor-
related with the activation of a variety of intracellular sig-
naling pathways to arrest the cell cycle in the G1
, S, or G2
phase. In malignant tumors, cell population in the G1
phase
appears less frequent (<70%) than in normal tissue (>90%).
The damage that causes G1
-check point arrest is believed to
be an irreversible process and the cells ultimately undergo
apoptosis. Our data indicated that emodin caused the
increase of cells in the G1
phase in a dose-dependent man-
ner with the decrease of cells in diploid regions (G2
and S
phases). Thus, it could be concluded that emodin had the
ability to induce apoptosis in proliferating cells. However,
the cells in diploid regions seemed to have accumulated at
the G1
phase before shifting to the sub-diploid region as the
percentage of cells at the diploid G1
region greatly increased
with the decrease of cells in the S and G2
phases.
The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, first identified by
Nowell and Hungerford in 1960, is the cytogenetic hall-
mark of CML.27 The Ph chromosome is a shortened chro-
mosome 22 that is a by-product of a reciprocal chromosomal
translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and
22, t(9;22)(q34;q11).28 A consequence of this chromosomal
translocation is the replacement of the first exon of the

cellular ABL non-receptor tyrosine kinase gene with
sequences from the cellular BCR (break point cluster)
gene,29 resulting in a chimeric BCR-ABL oncoprotein with
highly dysregulated, constitutive tyrosine kinase activity.30
Three major forms of the BCR-ABL oncogene have been
reported based on the break point occurring in the BCR
gene. The most commonly occurring form of BCR-ABL is
a 210 kDa oncoprotein that is found in most cases of CML
and 5% to 10% of adults with acute leukemia. The other 2
forms of BCR-ABL are 230 kDa and 185 kDa proteins that
are associated with chronic neutrophilic leukemia and acute
lymphocytic leukemia, respectively.31 Various studies have
established that the BCR-ABL 210 kDa protein is onco-
genic and is essential for the pathogenesis of CML.
The PI3Ks are a family oflipid kinases that catalyze the
phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the 30-hydroxyl
group. A critical product of this reaction is phosphatidylino-
sitol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a vital second messenger,
which recruits downstream signaling proteins including Akt
and the PDK1.32 PDK1 phosphorylates and activates AKT.
The PI3K pathway is frequently upregulated in human
tumors.33The activation of the PI3K pathway is relatively
well understood and is known to be a multistep process
involving the PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of phospho-
lipids localized at the plasma membrane, and the subse-
quent membrane localization of PDK1 and Ser/Thr kinase
AKT (also known as protein kinase B) via their pleckstrin
homology (PH) domains. The activation of PI3K ultimately
leads to AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473.
Activated AKT controls fundamental cellular processes
such as cell survival by phosphorylating and inactivating
several downstream pro-apoptotic target molecules. The
fact that AKT overexpression is found in many human can-
cers, that active AKT promotes resistance to chemo- and
radiotherapy, and that AKT activity is sufficient to block
apoptosis induced by a number of death stimuli has resulted
in intensive studies on the role of AKT as a mediator of the
PI3K survival signal. Elevated levels of phosphorylated
PI3K/AKT can protect cells from undergoing apoptosis and
contribute to drug resistance.34 Therefore, inhibition of the
PI3K/AKT pathway by pharmacological or genetic
approaches may improve the response of cancer cells to
chemotherapy.35As mentioned above, the treatment of cells
with emodin alone or in combination with other chemother-
apeutic agents has been shown to effectively counteract
tumor progression, although the emodin-mediated molecu-
lar mechanism responsible for this effect remains to be fully
elucidated. Given the importance of the aforementioned
pathway in the modulation of tumor progression, the aim of
the present study was to examine in detail how emodin
affects the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, leading to a cell
death that biochemically resembles the typical features of
apoptosis. We propose a model that supports the therapeutic
validity of emodin in the treatment of human malignancies
and other pathological conditions, since the emodin-medi-
ated regulation of components of the PI3K pathway
upstream of AKT leads to an effective downregulation of
AKT kinase activity.
PTEN/PI3K/AKT constitutes an important pathway reg-
ulating the signaling of multiple biological processes such as
apoptosis, metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell growth.
PTEN is a major lipid 3-phosphatase, which signals down
the PI3 kinase/AKT pro-apoptotic pathway. Furthermore,
PTEN is a protein phosphatase, with the ability to dephos-
phorylate both serine and threonine residues. The protein-
phosphatase activity has also been shown to regulate various
cell-survival pathways, such as the mitogen-activated kinase
(MAPK) pathway. It is well established that PTEN's lipid-
phosphatase activity, via the PI3K/AKT pathway, mediates
growth suppression functions.36 Our results demonstrated
that emodin can trigger apoptosis throughupregulating the
expression of PTEN.
In brief, our results provide new insights that emodin can
trigger apoptosis through the inhibition of PI3K/AKT level,
upregulating the expression of PTEN anddeleting BCR-ABL.
Thus, in our findings emodin remarkably showed potent
effects on the inhibition of K562 cells growth by inducing
apoptosis. These results suggest that emodin may be devel-
oped as a promising chemotherapeutic agent in chronic
myelocytic leukemia therapy in the future. The data also
strongly support the view of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway
as an important target for drug discovery.
