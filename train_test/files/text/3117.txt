VOTERS AND VALUES IN THE 2004 ELECTION
GARY LANGER

Abstract A poorly devised exit poll question undermined mean-
ingful analysis of voters' concerns in the 2004 presidential election.
Twenty-two percent of voters picked "moral values" from a list of
"issues" describing what mattered most in their vote, more than selected
any other item. Various commentators have misinterpreted this single
data point to conclude that moral values are an ascendant political issue
and to credit conservative Christian groups with turning George
W. Bush's popular vote defeat in 2000 into his three million­vote margin
of victory in 2004. We suggest, rather, that while morals and values are
critical in informing political judgments, they represent personal charac-
teristics and ill-defined policy preferences far more than any discrete
political issue. First by conflating morals and values and then by further
conflating characteristics and issues, the exit poll's "issues" list dis-
torted our understanding of the 2004 election. In this article, we exam-
ine the flaws in the 2004 National Election Pool exit poll's "most
important issue" question and explore the presumed rising electoral
importance of moral values and the conservative Christians who over-
whelmingly selected this item. Using national exit poll data from 1980
through 2004 and other national surveys, we find that the moral values
item on the issues list cannot properly be viewed as a discrete issue or
set of closely related issues; that its importance to voters has not grown
over time; and that when controlled for other variables, it ranks low on
the issues list in predicting 2004 vote choices. The aggregated exit poll
data also show that the voting behavior of conservative Christians is rel-
atively stable over time, and these voters were not primarily responsible
for Bush's improvement in 2004 over 2000.
"Moral values" led the list of top issues cited by voters in the 2004 National
Election Pool (NEP) exit poll, leading to widespread reports that a rise in
moral concerns, particularly among conservative Christians, was the driving

factor in George W. Bush's reelection. This conclusion, the combined result
of a poorly constructed survey question and incomplete data analysis, is mis-
placed.
Voting behavior depends on a panoply of influences--attitudes and emo-
tions, issues and attributes alike (Miller and Shanks 1996). Values--and for
some voters, morals--are important elements of some such influences. But
our analysis of the exit poll data shows that "moral values," when controlling
for other variables, ranked only as high as fourth of seven competing items in
predicting vote choices, behind terrorism, the economy, and Iraq and tied with
health care.1 Nor were conservative Christians responsible for Bush's
improvement over the 2000 election; neither their share of the electorate nor
their support for Bush increased.2
This was not the message delivered by many news outlets in their election
coverage. "Voters who care about moral values delivered the election to Pres-
ident Bush," the Washington Times declared in an editorial. It was "an elec-
tion that . . . amounted to a referendum on moral values," reported USA
Today. On CNN's Crossfire, cohost Tucker Carlson said, "Three days after
the election, it is clear that it was not the war on terror, but the issue of what
we're calling moral values that drove President Bush and other Republicans to
victory this week."3
These and other commentators were led astray by a seemingly simple and
straightforward marginal result: Terrorism did not rank first among the issues
presented to voters on the exit poll questionnaire as "most important" in their
vote. As shown in table 1, 22 percent instead cited moral values; 20 percent,
the economy and jobs; and 19 percent, terrorism.4
The inclusion of moral values distorted this list (Langer 2004). Compared
with the other items, it is not commensurate, comparable, or a discrete political
issue. Instead it served as an ill-defined grab bag, especially for Bush voters,
who, compared with John Kerry's voters, had fewer appealing options among
the other items offered and among whom this phrase particularly resonates.5
1. Moral values tied with health care as the fourth biggest predictor of voting for Bush (in terms
of predicted probability). See table 9 below. See also Hillygus and Shields (2005) for an evalua-
tion of vote preference data from an Internet panel.
2. Bush lost the popular vote in 2000 by 537,179 votes (per America Votes 24 [Scammon,
McGillivray, and Cook 2001]) and won it in 2004 by 3,012,171 votes (per America Votes 26
[Scammon, McGillivray, and Cook 2006]).
3. See appendix A.
4. The 2004 exit poll was conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the National Election Pool (ABC,
AP, CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC). The 1996 and 2000 exit polls were conducted by the Voter
News Service, a consortium of these same news organizations, absent Fox in 1996. The 1980,
1984, 1988, and 1992 exit poll data used in this article were gathered by ABC News. For a list of
questions used in the analysis, see appendix B.
5. Kerry overwhelmingly won voters who picked four issues--the economy (80 percent to
18 percent), Iraq (73 to 26 percent), health care (77 to 23 percent), and education (73 to 26 percent).
Bush won voters who picked moral values (80 percent to 18 percent), terrorism (86 to 14 percent),
and taxes (by a much narrower 57 to 43 percent).
746 Langer and Cohen
The other terms on this list are not entirely precise: "Health care" may
cover subtopics from insurance costs to prescription drug benefits; "economy/
jobs" may boil down to interest rates or gasoline prices; and picking "the war
in Iraq" does not tell us, in and of itself, the respondent's position on the war.
But these phrases have reasonably specific common meanings in a way that
"moral values" does not.6 A Pew Research Center (2004) survey after the elec-
tion asked respondents who cited moral values as an important issue in their
vote what the phrase brought to mind. The open-ended question produced a
broad range of responses: Twenty-nine percent said gay marriage; 28 percent,
abortion; 18 percent, religious belief; 9 percent, honesty or integrity; and
7 percent, "other policy issues." Six percent cited Kerry as having or lacking
such values; an equal 6 percent cited Bush as having or lacking such values.
Pew produced 17 coded categories in all (multiple answers were accepted),
including 2 percent who cited the media or "what's on TV." The range of
meanings underscores the point that moral values are not a discrete political
issue. We suggest instead that, unlike the other six items on the list, moral val-
ues functions as an amalgam of personal attributes, policy-related predisposi-
tion, and preference concerning current conditions of immorality (Kinder and
Sears 1985; Miller and Shanks 1996; Zaller 1992). It should not have been
included with such unlike items in a single list question.
Including the word moral (as in "Moral Majority") compounded the distor-
tion, making this not just any misplaced attribute in an issues list but also a
religious attribute. Moral is a hot-button word (ill-advised in polling) that res-
onates with a particular, core Republican group, religious conservatives; its
use makes it impossible to differentiate policy attitudes from a recitation of
6. Gary Bauer, former presidential candidate and president of a group called American Values,
told ABC News, "Well, obviously the phrase moral values or moral issues is a little vague, and so
it leaves it open to a lot of interpretation" (ABC News transcript, This Week with George Stepha-
nopoulos, November 28, 2004).

those characteristics. In a preelection ABC News poll, likely voters divided by
51 percent to 41 percent on which candidate best represented their "values."
In the exit poll, by contrast, those who selected "moral" values favored Bush
by 80 to 18 percent.
Indeed, the moral values item was overwhelmingly, almost irresistibly,
appealing to religious conservatives. As shown in table 2, 72 percent of con-
servative religious evangelical white Christians selected moral values from
the seven-item list, as did 61 percent of voters who said that the top attribute
they sought in a candidate was "religious faith," 45 percent of conservative
white Protestants or other non-Catholic Christians, 43 percent of weekly
churchgoing white Protestants or other Christians, 42 percent of evangelical
white Protestants or other Christians, and 37 percent of conservatives.7 It was
chosen by far fewer Catholics (17 percent) and those who attend church infre-
quently if ever (15 percent), the groups that, as we explore below, shifted the
most toward Bush in 2004 versus 2000.
In a multivariate model, presented in table 3, attending church weekly, self-
identifying as a conservative, and self-identifying as an evangelical Christian
are the strongest positive predictors of selecting moral values as the top elec-
tion "issue." Each increases the likelihood of a voter selecting moral values by
about 10 percent (being a Democrat has the largest negative impact, lowering
the likelihood by 12 percent).
The moral values item on the exit poll issues list, then, created its own cen-
ter of gravity. The word religion may just as well have appeared in its place--
inarguably important to measure but simply not a comparable political issue.
The question in effect asked voters: "What was the most important issue
in your vote for president--the economy, terrorism, Iraq, health care, taxes,
education--or, rather, are you a conservative, religious person?"
7. From this point forward, "other Christians" refers to other non-Catholic Christians.

An argument might have been made for including values, moral or other-
wise, on the issues list if it were volunteered in significant numbers in preelec-
tion polls that asked, open-ended, the most important issue in the election.8
But it was not; "moral values" as a phrase almost never came up in such sur-
veys, and responses that could reasonably be coded as involving such values
(from honesty, to abortion, to being a religious person) were not volunteered,
in aggregate, beyond single digits.9
Regardless of who selected moral values, exit poll data do not support
claims that such values were ascendant as a political concern. National exit
polls by the Los Angeles Times included "moral values" as an option in 1992
and "moral/ethical" values as options in 1996, 2000, and 2004. In the 1992
L.A. Times poll, "moral values" was selected by 24 percent; in the 2004 NEP
exit poll, as noted, by 22 percent. This is not a perfect comparison, because the
questions include different items, the L.A. Times poll listed more items, and it
8. Again, our argument is not that moral values are irrelevant (see Abramowitz 1995); to the
contrary, they are too important to mismeasure (Stoker 1987).
9. See, e.g., Gallup's "most important problem" questions from July 8­11 and August 8­11,
2004. In the July and August Gallup surveys, just 7 percent cited dishonesty, lack of integrity,
abortion, homosexuality, gay issues, or a decline in ethics, morals, religion, or family as the
country's most important problem (Roper iPoll: USGALLUP.04JULY8.R07, USGALLUP.
04AUST09.R07).

allowed two responses. The 1996­2004 L.A. Times polls are more compara-
ble; they listed different items but the same number of items and the same "top
two" choice. In 1996 "moral/ethical" values was selected by 40 percent; in
2000, by 35 percent; and in 2004, again by 40 percent (see table 4).
While a set of ill-defined "moral values" was not ascendant, it is still pos-
sible that the voting patterns of the conservative Christian groups whose
members disproportionately selected the item on the exit poll did in fact dif-
fer in 2004 relative to previous elections. If by topping the list moral values
pointed to this group's true impact, then, perhaps the poorly devised exit
poll question would not necessarily have distorted election analysis. And in
fact, political commentary on the election result reached beyond the selec-
tion of "moral values" as the top "issue" to a discussion of the voters who
predominantly selected it. "The Republicans are in power because the evan-
gelicals and social conservatives voted them into power," the evangelist Pat
Robertson said in November 2004 (Dunham and Gleckman 2004). Some
evangelicals used the moral values number not only to proclaim their impact
but to demand political payback: "`Values' voters delivered for the presi-
dent, and the president must now deliver for them--especially in the
courts."10 But is the evangelical impact so clear?
Conservative Christians are a core Republican voting bloc (Guth and Green
1991; Layman 1997; Pew Research Center 2005). But simple mathematics
requires that for this group to be responsible for the change in popular vote
margins from 2000 to 2004, its members must have made up a greater share of
the electorate and/or supported Bush in disproportionately greater numbers.
Neither is substantively so.

Exit poll trend data are not available for evangelicals; the 2000 survey did
not include the question.11 But various closely related groups, including con-
servative white Protestants, weekly churchgoing white Protestants, and all
weekly churchgoers, did not make up a greater share of the 2004 electorate
than they did in 2000, and their vote patterns were largely similar.12 For exam-
ple, table 5 shows that weekly churchgoing white Protestants were no more
likely to vote for Bush in 2004 than they were in 2000. For other categoriza-
tions, the changes in vote choice were relatively small; indeed, a bigger
change is among Catholics. Nor was there any significant change in the share
of the electorate made up by conservative white Protestants or similar groups:
Weekly churchgoing white Protestants if anything made up a somewhat
smaller share of the 2004 electorate than the 2000 electorate.
As shown in table 6, the percentage of Republican voters who are white
Protestants or other Christians was essentially the same in 2004 as it was in
1980. In 2004, white Protestants and other Christians cast 55 percent of all
votes for Bush; in 1980, 56 percent of all of Ronald Reagan's votes came from
this group. Similarly, 34 percent of Bush's 2004 votes came from conservative
11. We limit this trend analysis to comparable exit poll items.
12. In the 2004 exit poll, evangelical white Protestants and other Christians correlated highly
with each of these groups, e.g., .56 with weekly churchgoing white Protestants and .47 with con-
servative white Protestants.

white Protestants and other Christians; in 1980 this group accounted for
35 percent of Reagan voters.13
While the relative size of these voting blocs has been stable, conservative
white Protestants and other Christians have been increasingly likely to self-
identify as Republicans (see table 6). The changing partisan identification of
conservative white Protestants and other Christians has electoral implications,
but they are not chiefly responsible for Bush's improvement from 2000 to
2004. Indeed, Bush got more additional votes from Catholics than from white
Protestants in 2004 versus 2000.
A related measure, church attendance, tells a similar story. Frequent church
attendees did not make up a larger share of the electorate in 2004 than they did
in 2000; nor, again, was there any significant difference in their likelihood of
voting for Bush. Weekly church attendees--particularly white Protestant and
other Christian weekly churchgoers--were much more likely to vote for Bush
than for Al Gore in 2000 or John Kerry in 2004 (see table 7). However, table 8
shows that this relationship is severely attenuated when controlled for political
party identification and ideology and that the estimated effect of frequent
churchgoing on a Bush vote did not increase from 2000 to 2004.
Indeed, contrary to the notion that frequent church attendees delivered the
2004 election to Bush, his bigger gains over 2000 were in the opposite
13. The data in table 6 show a small decline in the percent of Republican voters who are white
Protestants and other Christians in 2004 relative to the 1988­2000 elections, which suggests
growth in the Republican coalition outside the groups now widely supposed to have produced
Bush's 2004 popular vote victory.

voters who reported never attending church were four points more likely to
support Bush in 2004 than they were in 2000; among those who attend church
once a week or more, the increase was not significant--a single point. (Specif-

by six points among those who attend church less than weekly, versus two
points among those who attend weekly or more often.) As noted above,
32 percent of weekly churchgoers picked moral values as the top issue in their
vote, compared with 15 percent of less-frequent churchgoers.
While Bush's support among conservative white Protestants changed little
from 2000 to 2004, his support among Catholics, quintessential swing voters,
increased more significantly. (White Catholics, in particular, have gone with
presidential election winners since at least 1980, counting Bush in 2000 as the
winner. Bush won white Catholics by a 13-point margin in 2004, compared
with a seven-point margin in 2000.) But moral values was comparatively less
important to the Catholic vote: As noted, 17 percent of Catholics (and 19 per-
cent of white Catholics) selected moral values as the most important issue in
their vote, half the number of evangelical white Protestants who did so.14 If
anything, then, the effect of religion in 2004 was more about Bush's gains
among infrequent churchgoers and Catholics than his support among the
evangelical white Protestants who have been the primary focus of postelection
analyses.15
Momentarily setting aside conceptual problems with the moral values item,
a closer analysis of the data shows that it was far from the "most important
issue" in Bush's electoral victory. A logit analysis predicting Bush votes, pre-
sented in table 9, shows that moral values ranks much lower than other issues
in our model. Controlling for partisan self-identification, race, ideology, reli-
gion, and church attendance, moral values has less predictive power than ter-
rorism, the economy, and Iraq; it is tied with health care for fourth in terms of
predictive probability. In the Bush model, moral values has less than half the
predictive power of the terrorism item.16 (The single biggest predictor of Bush
votes, not surprisingly, is self-identifying as a Republican.)
These data leave open the question of what moral values actually means,
beyond invoking conservatism and religiosity. The Pew results cited above
suggest that, albeit only for some respondents, the question may have served
as a stand-in for two implied but unspecified issues, same-sex marriage and
abortion. Unfortunately, the NEP exit poll asked the issues list in one version
of its questionnaire and questions on abortion and same-sex couples on a dif-
ferent version, making cross-tabulation of these variables impossible. (In an
14. This finding is confirmed by a logit analysis predicting Bush vote that shows that moral val-
ues has a greater estimated effect in predicted probability of voting for Bush among evangelical
Protestants than it does among Catholics.
15. These are numerically significant groups: Infrequent churchgoers accounted for 57 percent of
voters in the 2004 election, and Catholics accounted for 27 percent, compared with evangelical
white Protestants/other Christians at 23 percent.
16. This article deals with the direct effects of the most important issues on vote choice, as
respondents' choices on that question are strongly correlated with their votes. We also estimated
models with interactions, not shown here, that indicate that while the top issue highlighted in this
analysis, terrorism, had a direct effect on respondents' likelihood of voting for Bush regardless of
religion, moral values influenced presidential vote choice only for people with particular religious
backgrounds, particularly evangelical Protestants.

same-sex marriage, religious conservatism, and the view that elected leaders
should rely on their religious beliefs in making policy decisions all related
positively with one another--with correlations between .23 and .36.)17
In the exit poll, 26 percent of voters said both that abortion should be illegal
in all or most cases and that there should be no recognition of same-sex
marriages--roughly equivalent to the 22 percent who selected moral values as
the most important "issue" in their vote. Bush's support is as highly correlated
with opposition to abortion and to same-sex unions (phi = .345; p < .001) as it
is with the selection of moral values (phi = .311; p < .001). Moreover, controlling

not identical; for yet others, moral values may entirely reflect personal
attributes or predispositions related to morality or any of a range of other
issues, sentiments, or beliefs. It is this lack of definition that renders the
phrase "moral values" so inapt as a political "issue."
The conflation of political, ideological, and religious views represents a
critical aspect of election politics. Measuring and understanding voters' values
and religious beliefs, and the extent to which these inform vote choices,
together and separately, is crucial to election analysis. Indeed these influences
are too important to be mismeasured with an ill-defined phrase in an ill-
constructed list, as occurred in the 2004 National Election Pool exit poll. The

NOTE.--Dependent variable is vote for Bush 0,1; all independent variables included as 0,1 dum-
mies. Models 1 and 2 are unstandardized logit coefficients. For estimated effect in predicted probabil-
ity, for moral values and opposition to same-sex unions and abortion (combination of two questions
on the exit poll), the "effect in probability" is the average difference for sample respondents in the esti-
mated probability of voting for Bush between selecting and not selecting moral values in Model 1 and
indicating an opposition to both same-sex unions and abortion in Model 2; for each model the other
independent variables are set to their actual values for each individual in the sample.

inclusion of "moral values" on the exit poll as part of a seven-item issues list
undermined rather than elucidated our understanding of the 2004 election. The
list conflated voter attitudes on issues and underlying predispositions. More-
over, even given this faulty list, "moral values" was not, in fact, the most
important "issue" in the election; nor were the conservative Christian groups
who disproportionately selected it the main movers in turning Bush's popular
vote defeat in 2000 into his 2004 victory. Future exit polls should measure
issues and underlying values discretely; exit polls, after all--like all other
survey research--require balanced questions and cautious analysis alike.
Appendix A
ABC News, Good Morning America, November 4, 2004: Well, the campaign is over
but one of the big surprises still has everyone talking. Voters saying that their top issue
in choosing a candidate, not the economy, not terrorism, not Iraq, but moral values.
AP, November 3, 2004: Moral values--heavily emphasized by the president--
edged terrorism and the economy as the top issue.
Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial, November 10, 2004: . . . the message was
clear. Faith and family values matter; they are not just relevant but dominant. Last
week's overwhelming 3.5 million-vote presidential margin has given us "values vot-
ers" an important reassurance that will resonate in politics for years to come. . . .
Chicago Tribune, November 4, 2004: There is little doubt that faith fueled the re-
election of President Bush, which some described as electoral evidence of the growing
political proximity of "God and country." Asked which single issue mattered most in
their choice for president, 22 percent of voters chose moral values above everything
else. . . .
CNN, Crossfire, November 5, 2004 (Tucker Carlson, cohost): Three days after the
presidential election, it is clear that it was not the war on terror, but the issue of what
we're calling moral values that drove President Bush and other Republicans to victory
this week.
Cox News Service, November 3, 2004: Headline: Moral values a deciding election
issue
Dallas Morning News, November 4, 2004: Their seeds planted 20-plus years ago by
the Moral Majority, America's values voters blossomed this year into a political force
that could portend a lasting Republican majority.
Deseret Morning News/Religion News Service, November 4, 2004: Forget Iraq.
Forget terrorism. Forget the economy. The biggest factor shaping people's votes
Tuesday was the mother of all sleeper issues--"moral values."
Hartford Courant, November 4, 2004: Headline: An unexpected "moral" victory;
Bush benefits as voters put heavy emphasis on values
Minneapolis Star Tribune, November 4, 2004: More than any other concern--not
job creation, not Iraq--voters in exit polls declared "moral values" their top priority,
and 80 percent of them backed the president. Those 20 million voters were at the heart
of Bush's reelection which gave him new clout in pursuing his conservative agenda.
N.Y. Times, November 4, 2004: . . . Americans said they were motivated to vote for
President Bush on Tuesday by moral values as much as anything else. . . . In the survey, a
Voters and Values in the 2004 Election 757
striking portrait of one influential group emerged--that of a traditional, church-going
electorate that leans conservative on social issues and strongly backed Mr. Bush. . . .
Scripps Howard News Service, November 4, 2004: . . . one statistic might help to
put into perspective the verdict from the rest of America. . . .
USA Today, November 4, 2004: In an election that . . . amounted to a referendum on
moral values. . . .
Washington Times editorial, November 4, 2004: Voters who care about moral values
delivered the election to President Bush. . . . The exit polls couldn't have been clearer.
They showed that more voters think moral values--that is, the vaunted "God, guns and
gays" questions--are the most important question facing the nation than think the same
about the state of the economy, the terrorist threat or the Iraq war.
