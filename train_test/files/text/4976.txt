Introduction
Eating disorders are life-threatening mental illnesses that
cost Australians approximately Aus$60 billion every year
(Deloitte Access Economics, 2012). Anorexia nervosa (AN),
bulimia nervosa (BN), eating disorder not otherwise speci-
fied (EDNOS), and binge eating disorder (BED) are the most
well-recognized eating disorders, all of which have signifi-
cant biopsychosocial impacts upon the lives of those affected
by the illnesses (Deloitte Access Economics, 2012). The
peak age of onset for eating disorders occurs in adolescence
(Kohn & Golden, 2001) with young people increasingly at
risk due to their developmental stage and the influence of the
sociocultural context (Banyard, 2010; Gremillion, 2003;
Grigg, Bowman, & Redman, 1996; Hay, Mond, Buttner, &
Darby, 2008). Evidence suggests that early intervention leads
to better treatment outcomes (Al-Yaman, Sargaent, & Bryant,
2003; Deloitte Access Economics, 2012), indicating a need
for effective treatments aimed at the adolescent population.
Group modalities are commonly used in the treatment of
adolescent eating disorders both nationally and internation-
ally, for example, Southern Health Butterfly Day Program
(Victoria, Australia) and the Renfrew Centre (United States);
however, research in this area remains largely underdevel-
oped (Fuhriman & Burlingame, 1994; Gowers & Lock,
2005). There exists a broad range of group therapies aimed at
treating the various features and psychosocial impacts of the
illnesses, such as body image groups (Bhatnagar,Wisniewski,
Solomon, & Heinberg, 2013), nutrition groups (Goldstein et
al., 2011), social skills groups (Tasca, Balfour, Presniak, &
Bissada, 2012), and psychotherapy groups (Nevonen &
Broberg, 2006); yet, few studies have explored the efficacy
of these treatment models with the adolescent population.
In contrast, research on adults has begun to explore the
utility of various group treatment modalities for a variety of
eating disorder diagnoses (Brownley, Berkman, Sedway,
Lohr, & Bulik, 2007; Safer, Telch, & Agras, 2001; Telch,
Agras, & Linehan, 2001). There exists a body of literature
demonstrating the effectiveness of group cognitive behav-
ioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of adults living with BN
(Brownley et al., 2007; Polnay et al., 2013; Zimpfer, 1990).
Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has shown promise in
the treatment of adults living with both BN and BED (Chen
& Safer, 2010; Erb, Farmer, & Mehlenbeck, 2013; Safer,

Group Therapy for Adolescents Living
With an Eating Disorder: A Scoping
Review
Jessica Downey1
Abstract
Group models are commonly used to treat eating disorders; however, research in this area remains largely underdeveloped.
Interest in group work is likely to increase due to the demands on the public health system and the cost-effectiveness of
group modalities. This scoping review sought to explore the evidence underpinning group therapy for adolescents living
with an eating disorder. A literature search of 10 academic databases and four gray literature databases was undertaken in
2013. Selected Internet resources were searched and the author consulted professionals from Eating Disorders Victoria,
the Butterfly Foundation, and the University of Melbourne. A total of 11 peer-reviewed articles published between 2003
and 2013 were included for review. There was an overall lack of research with no randomized-controlled trials available. Six
program evaluations and five program descriptions were found, and they reported on a range of eating disorders and group
modalities. The program evaluations suggested the utility of group therapy for promoting weight restoration in underweight
individuals living with an eating disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy groups were found to be more effective for bulimia
nervosa and multifamily group therapy showed promise for anorexia nervosa. More rigorous research is needed to establish
the effectiveness of group therapy for adolescents living with an eating disorder.

Telch, & Chen, 2009). Similarly, group interpersonal therapy
(IPT) has been shown to reduce binging in adults diagnosed
with BED (Agras et al., 1995), and emerging research is
beginning to trial motivational models for adults living with
AN (Touyz, Thornton, Rieger, George, & Beumont, 2003).
While it is evident that group models can promote positive
outcomes for individuals living with an eating disorder
(Berkman, Lohr, & Bulik, 2007; Brownley et al., 2007), it
remains unclear whether evidence exists to support the use of
group therapy for adolescents (Keel & Haedt, 2008).
The most commonly used model of treatment for adoles-
cents with AN is family-based treatment (FBT), while CBT
is preferred therapy for BN (Lock & Fitzpatrick, 2009).
Treatment approaches for adolescents living with EDNOS
depend upon how closely the symptoms align with either BN
or AN (Yager et al., 2012). Multifamily therapy (MFT) is
posited a promising group model for young people, given its
potential to strengthen familial relationships (Tantillo, 2006).
An integrative group model including art therapy and drama
therapy has been advocated by Diamond-Raab and Orrell-
Valente (2002); however, there are no studies examining the
effectiveness of this model. Research on group treatments in
adolescents is somewhat haphazard with no consistent
themes emerging in the literature. However, interest in group
work is likely to increase due to the demands on the public
health system and the cost-effectiveness of group modalities
(McGilley, 2006; Wanlass, Moreno, & Thomson, 2005).
There exist a seemingly endless variety of group interven-
tions (Wanlass et al., 2005) with no published papers pre-
senting a compilation of evidenced-based group therapy for
the adolescent population. This scoping review seeks to
address that gap.
Method
A scoping study methodology was selected to examine the
breadth of available evidence in relation to group models for
adolescents living with an eating disorder. The author fol-
lowed the procedure outlined by Arksey and O'Malley
(2005). The purpose of applying a scoping study framework
was to map available evidence, summarize research findings,
identify research gaps, and to determine the value of under-
taking a systematic review. The framework provided by
Arksey and O'Malley facilitated this process. The stages of
this research included the following: identifying the research
question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, chart-
ing the data, collating the data, summarizing the data, and
reporting the results.
In April and May 2013, an exhaustive search of the litera-
ture was conducted to identify studies that responded to the
question: What evidence exists to support the use of group
therapy for adolescents living with an eating disorder? For
the purposes of this research, "group therapy" is defined as
"a meeting of two or more people for a common therapeutic
purpose or to achieve a common goal" (Centre for Substance
Abuse Treatment, p. xxv). The World Health Organization's
(2013) definition of "adolescents" was selected as it is inter-
nationally recognized and specifies an age range of 10 to 19
years. Finally, "eating disorders" was defined according to
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric
Association [APA], 2000). This includes AN, BN, EDNOS,
and BED.
The primary method of data search involved controlled
vocabulary and keyword searches (Table 1). The thesaurus
and subject terms in each database were used to modify the
keywords. In all, 11 electronic databases and 5 gray literature
databases were searched for articles published between 2003
and 2013. Articles obtained from the databases were refer-
ence checked for related studies. Second, websites of 28 key
organizations were hand searched. The author searched these
websites to identify "hidden" sources of knowledge on the
subject matter. These websites included the National Eating
Disorder Collaboration, the Cochrane Library, and the
Campbell Collaboration. Third, the author conversed with
professionals from Eating Disorders Victoria and the
Butterfly Foundation. Three librarians from the University of
Melbourne were also consulted.
Studies were selected based on their capacity to respond
to the research question (Figure 1). The reviewer made selec-
tions by filtering articles based on their title and abstract. If
studies met the inclusion criteria, the full texts were reviewed.
The search yielded 526 references from academic databases
and 191 results from gray literature databases. The reviewer
identified 11 studies that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria
and responded to the research question. Included studies
were scanned for the following information: sample details,
research methods, intervention type, outcomes, and study
context. The data were extracted and charted as shown in the
appendix.
Results
Mapping the Results
The studies were derived from national and international
sources with the majority of research in this area stemming
from Europe. Five of the studies were conducted in England,
two in Germany, one in Spain, one in Italy, and one in
Denmark. One Australian study was included in this review
(Goldstein et al., 2011).
The most frequent use of group therapy found in this
study occurred in an outpatient or day program setting and
the least frequent use of groups took place in an inpatient
setting. It is important to note that the group models from the
various geographical locations were also delivered within
differing health care systems. This was not exclusively com-
mented upon within the literature.

Sample Characteristics
All participants were aged between 11 and 19 years. Of the
377 adolescents across all studies, only 11 were male. Illness
duration and treatment history were rarely reported with only
3 of the 11 studies providing these data. The reported range
of illness duration in these studies was from 2 to 6 years
(Prestano, Lo Coco, Gullo, & Lo Verso, 2008; Pretorius et
al., 2012; Wood, Al-Khairulla, & Lask, 2011). None of the
studies provided information on participants' ethnicity or
cultural background. Attrition was noted as a key issue for
most studies with rates of up to 37% being reported (Hollesen,
Clausen, & Rokkedal, 2013)
Most studies included mixed samples of varying diagno-
ses.All 11 studies discussed the treatment ofAN; 4 discussed
the treatment of BN; 4 discussed the treatment of EDNOS;
and none discussed the treatment of BED.
Research Methods
In the past 10 years, there have been no published random-
ized-controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of group
therapy for adolescents living with an eating disorder. The
most rigorous studies on this topic area are program evalua-
tions. All program evaluations sought to measure outcomes
by assessing a decrease in eating disorder symptomatology,
and there were 26 different measurement tools noted across
all studies. The most commonly used outcome measure was
body mass index (BMI; Goldstein et al., 2011; Hollesen et
al., 2013; Lazaro et al., 2011; Prestano et al., 2008; Pretorius
et al., 2012; Salbach-Andrae, Bohnekamp, Pfeiffer, &
Lehmkuhl, 2008). Other common measurement tools
included the following: the Self-Esteem in Eating
Questionnaire (SEED; Lazaro et al., 2011; Prestano et al.,
2008), the Eating Disorder Inventory 1 (EDI; Hollesen et al.,
2013; Prestano et al., 2008), and the Eating Disorder
Inventory 2 (EDI-2; Goldstein et al., 2011; Salbach-Andrae
et al., 2008).
Interventions
Seven different types of group interventions were identified
through this review, including transition program, DBT,
MFT, friends group, cognitive remediation therapy (CRT),
group analytic therapy (GAT), and social skills and self-
esteem (SSE) groups. These interventions were described
and/or evaluated in each study.
The most common intervention in the literature was MFT;
however, the models of this therapy varied in each study.
Scholz, Rix, Scholz, Gantchev, and Thomke (2005) pre-
sented a MFT model aimed at symptom reduction and
strengthening family relationships. This approach is aligned
with the Maudsley Model, which is fast becoming the pre-
ferred treatment approach of adolescent AN (Lock &
Fitzpatrick, 2009). Nesbitt and Uprichard's (2009) model
differed from that of Scholz et al.'s, in that its aims were
geared toward the development of mutual support and
empowerment as opposed to specific symptom reduction.
Similarly, Honig's (2005) MFT held a supportive and col-
laborative focus in recognition of the expertise of families
with a lived experience. The final MFT model located for
this review was focused on encouraging the reflective pro-
cess and building positive relationships (Hollesen et al.,
2013).
The second most common intervention was CRT. Wood et
al.'s (2011) CRT group was based on a manualized treatment
for adult individuals living with AN (Tchanturia, Davis,
Reeder, & Wykes, 2010). Similarly, the CRT model pre-
sented by Pretorius et al. (2012) was an adaptation of a group
CRT model for adults with AN (Genders & Tchanturia,
2010). Both models of CRT aimed to improve various cogni-
tive domains through the use of games and puzzles. However,
the models differed in the frequency and duration of treat-
ment: 6 hr over 6 weeks (Wood et al., 2011) compared with
3 over 4 weeks (Pretorius et al., 2012).
The other interventions found through this review existed
in isolation; that is, only one model of each intervention was
presented. The GAT group model aimed to improve self-
esteem and to increase participant's awareness of the rela-
tionship between emotions and behavior (Prestano et al.,
2008). Lazaro et al.'s (2011) SSE group was based on a CBT
intervention that aimed to reduce anxiety and build confi-
dence. Similarly, Davies's (2004) friends group aimed to
reduce social withdrawal and build the participants' relation-
ship skills. The DBT group focused on improving emotional
regulation skills and decreasing eating disorder behaviors
such as restrictive eating and purging (Salbach-Andrae et al.,
2008). Goldstein et al.'s (2011) transition program comprised
of several different group therapies, including CBT, narrative
therapy, art therapy, healthy lifestyle group, nutrition group,
social eating group, and parents group. The program offered
a holistic approach with each group aimed at supporting
recovery and improving eating disorder symptomatology.
Treatment Duration
The duration of treatments varied significantly with a range
between 4 weeks and 2 years reported. Similarly, the fre-
quency and duration of sessions differed in each study. The
CRT group (Pretorius et al., 2012) had the lowest number of
treatment contact hours (3 hr total), whereas the transition
program (Goldstein et al., 2011) had the highest number of
contact hours (approx. 200 hr).
Outcomes
The type of outcome data reported varied depending upon
the aims of each study. The outcomes can be categorized as
biological, psychological, relational, and behavioral. These
multidimensional categories have been chosen as they reflect
Downey 5
the various components of eating disorder recovery (Tosh et
al., 2010). Diagnosis-specific outcomes are also presented to
highlight what is known about group treatment approaches
for specific eating disorders.
Biological Outcomes
Biological outcomes were measured across six studies by
pre/post-BMI calculations, with one study using ideal body
weight percentage (Ideal body weight% [IBW%]) as an
adjunct to BMI (Goldstein et al., 2011). The 25-week course
of DBT (Salbach-Andrae et al., 2008) saw the greatest
change in BMI with a mean increase of 2.5 for all adoles-
cents treated for AN. A mean post-test BMI score for BN was
not provided. Both the GAT (Prestano et al., 2008) and SSE
groups (Lazaro et al., 2011) resulted in a mean BMI increase
of 0.9, whereas the CRT group saw a mean increase of 0.5.
Research on the transition program found that 15 of the 26
participants who completed treatment maintained a body
weight percentage at or above 85% of their ideal weight
(Goldstein et al., 2011). The MFT outcomes were not
reported using mean BMI data; however, the authors reported
that treatment was found to have medium effects (d > 0.5) in
relation to BMI (Hollesen et al., 2013).
Psychological Outcomes
Lazaro et al. (2011) found that structured group therapy for
self-esteem improved adolescents' perception of body shape
and weight, perception of physical appearance, their happi-
ness and satisfaction, and their self-concept related to others.
Of the 20 young people who completed Hollesen et al.'s
(2013) MFT group, eating disorder symptomatology was
greatly reduced and the participant's interoceptive awareness
improved. Following treatment, 13 of the adolescents were
in remission, 1 met the criteria for AN, and 1 met the criteria
for BN.
A 2-year course of weekly GAT found that those with
higher psychological disturbance had poorer outcomes
(Prestano et al., 2008). However, following treatment, four
adolescents had recovered and one was in remission. Process
measures revealed an increased commitment to therapy
among those living with AN. This commitment to therapy
was not observed for the adolescents in the group living with
BN.
Wood et al. (2011) described their CRT group model as
targeting the participants' neuropsychological deficits. The
authors' clinical observations suggest that this type of group
therapy may facilitate cognitive flexibility and enhance par-
ticipant's capacity to see "the bigger picture." Pretorius et al.
(2012) found that four sessions of CRT resulted in a small yet
positive effect on the adolescents' self-reported cognitive
flexibility. While the effect size was small and motivation for
recovery remained stagnant, the researchers posited an
increased effect size with additional sessions. Motivation
for recovery also remained unchanged for adolescents
completing the transition program (Goldstein et al., 2011). It
was found that those who completed the program had a sig-
nificant change in attitudinal symptomatology and a decrease
in perfectionism.
The MFT model put forth by Scholz et al. (2005) was
reportedly successful in generating hope and reducing stigma
and isolation. Similarly, the experiential model of MFT
(Nesbitt & Uprichard, 2009) facilitated the development of a
strengths-based dialogue, while the friends group improved
participant's self-esteem (Davies, 2004).
Relational Outcomes
The SSE groups saw a decrease in social withdrawal of par-
ticipants and an increase in leadership (Lazaro et al., 2011).
However, the researchers investigating MFT did not find the
expected reduction in interpersonal difficulties (Hollesen et
al., 2013). Relational outcomes were not explicitly measured
in other program evaluations.
The friends group was designed to address friendship
issues that emerged for adolescents who were hospitalized as
a result of AN (Davies, 2004). The author reports that the
group was successful in assisting participants to overcome
isolation and relearn how to engage and eat with others. The
feedback provided by participants suggests that the group
enhanced their social skills and eased their transition back
into the school setting.
The most well-received adaptation of MFT appeared to be
based on a model put forward by Scholz et al. (2005) for the
treatment of adolescent AN. The author reports success for
most participants in generating solidarity. This contrasts the
strengths-based MFT group where clinicians and families
noted improved relational capacity, while adolescents found
it less useful (Nesbitt & Uprichard, 2009).
Behavioral Outcomes
With group DBT, it was observed that 5 of the 11 participants
who completed treatment achieved remission (Salbach-
Andrae et al., 2008). The authors describe DBT as targeting
eating disorder behavioral symptoms such as calorie restric-
tion, excessive exercising, laxative use, food restriction,
body checking, purging, binge eating, and diet pill use. The
study found that there was a reduction of these behavioral
symptoms in all participants with varying diagnoses.
However, those with co-morbid mental health issues were
less likely to reach remission. The transition program also
notes behavioral change as a key outcome (Goldstein et al.,
2011). However, the authors do not discuss the specific
behavior changes observed in the participants.
Diagnostic-Related Outcomes
While four studies included adolescents living with EDNOS
in their overall sample, no studies reported specifically on
outcomes for these illnesses. Participants diagnosed with
6 SAGE Open
EDNOS were subcategorized as restricting/AN subtype or
binge-purge/BN subtype. Thus, outcomes for those with
EDNOS varied depending upon the individual's proximity to
an AN or BN diagnosis.
GAT was found to be more beneficial for the treatment of
AN than for the treatment of BN (Prestano et al., 2008). The
SSE groups were less likely to benefit adolescents living
with AN compared with those with BN (Lazaro et al., 2011).
DBT resulted in higher remission rates for participants with
AN (Salbach-Andrae et al., 2008). Similarly, research on the
transition program suggests that this model of treatment may
lead to change in behavioral and attitudinal measures of eat-
ing pathology for adolescents living with AN (Goldstein
et al., 2011).
GAT was less successful for adolescents living with BN
(Prestano et al., 2008). The researchers theorized that this
was perhaps a result of the analytic technique, which does
not provide explicit advice about symptom management. In
contrast, Lazaro et al. (2011) found that those living with BN
were more likely to benefit from CBT-based self-esteem and
social skills groups.
Discussion
A review of the literature revealed several key themes.
Themes were selected for discussion based on their capacity
to address the research question. Similarly, themes that sug-
gested gaps in the literature were included for discussion to
highlight areas for future research.
Evidence of Effectiveness
The 11 studies in this review have described various group
interventions that show promise in the treatment of adoles-
cents living with an eating disorder. However, it was found
that there is a lack of rigorous research demonstrating effec-
tiveness of these interventions. This is surprising given the
ubiquitous nature of group treatments. While program
descriptions and program evaluations provide insight on
group treatment approaches, they make no claim to
effectiveness.
Measuring Outcomes
The review provided support for the use of seven group mod-
els, all of which assert different treatment aims and mecha-
nisms of change.The differing aims and treatment approaches
led to a multiplicity of outcome measures capturing different
aspects of change in the lives of the participants.
The most frequent outcome measure was BMI, which
suggests the primacy of biological recovery markers in eat-
ing disorder treatment. This may be a misleading measure of
recovery as weight gain does not equate to psychological
recovery or eating disorder severity. As evidenced in two
studies (Hollesen et al., 2013; Salbach-Andrae et al., 2008),
an increased BMI may only serve to change the adolescents
diagnosis from AN or BN to EDNOS. The medical model
may be implicated in the emphasis on weight-related bio-
logical outcomes. The recovery paradigm (Commonwealth
of Australia, 2009) provides the rationale for an increased
emphasis upon psychosocial outcome measures.
The author captured the variety of treatment aims and out-
comes across all studies by reviewing the results from a bio-
logical, psychological, relational, and behavioral perspective.
While the stated biological outcomes were all weight-related,
the psychological, relational, and behavioral outcomes var-
ied depending upon the aims of treatment. In addition to
BMI, 25 different tools were used to measure change in the
psychological, relational, and behavioral domains. This
plethora of tools aimed at measuring various eating disorder
symptoms acknowledges that one-dimensional change can-
not accurately capture the recovery process (Tosh et al.,
2010).
Interventions
While CBT appears to be the most common treatment
approach for adult eating disorders (Keel & Haedt, 2008),
MFT is the most frequently documented in the literature on
group approaches for adolescents. The interest in MFT may
stem from findings related to FBT in the treatment of young
people with AN (Keel & Haedt, 2008) and BN (Le Grange,
Crosby, Rathouz, & Levental, 2007). MFT is also an
approach that acknowledges the role of the family system in
a young person's recovery (Scholz et al., 2005). While MFT
demonstrated potential in the treatment of adolescents living
with AN (Hollesen et al., 2013), CBT was found to be more
beneficial for those living with BN (Lazaro et al., 2011). This
is consistent with the findings for BN among the adult popu-
lation (Brownley et al., 2007; Polnay et al., 2013; Zimpfer,
1990).
Research on CRT, DBT, SSE, the transition program, and
the friends group has demonstrated a variety of differing
approaches in treating adolescents living with an eating dis-
order. The research context for the treatment of adult eating
disorders points to the potential for other group models such
as IPT (Agras et al., 1995) and motivational interviewing
(Touyz et al., 2003). Research on older populations can act as
a guide for future development in the treatment of young
people. The interventions included in this review can also
provide a foundation for future research and clinical
practice.
Attrition
Attrition was noted as a key issue across eight of the studies
found through this review. Attrition was generally described
across all studies relative to those participants who did not
complete the course of treatment, with the study by Hollesen
et al. (2013) treating those who did not complete the
Downey 7
questionnaires and interviews as dropouts. High attrition
rates have been found to be a pervasive problem in eating
disorder treatment contexts (Neeren et al., 2010; Stein, Wing,
Lewis, & Raghunathan, 2011). Several studies have been
conducted to explore patterns of attrition; however, few have
managed to accurately predict attrition rates in study partici-
pants (Abdelbaky, Hay, & Touyz, 2013). Hollesen et al.
reported a 37% attrition rate, which was largely attributed to
patients who did not complete diagnostic interviews and
questionnaires. Salbach-Andrae et al. (2008) had the lowest
attrition rate of 8%; however, they did not discuss why the
individuals dropped out of treatment. Pretorius et al. (2012)
noted that previous CRT studies demonstrated low attrition
rates; however, their research resulted in one fifth of partici-
pants dropping out. Some research suggests that attrition
may be associated with a diagnosis of AN (Abdelbaky et al.,
2013). This may shed light on the high attrition rates found in
this review as AN was the most common diagnosis across all
studies. In addition to this, engagement is central in support-
ing strong therapeutic relationships and outcomes for treat-
ment-seeking individuals (Thompson, Bender, Windsor, &
Flynn, 2009). Adolescents display a particularly high rate of
disengagement and early termination (Thompson et al.,
2009). Further research is needed to explore patterns of attri-
tion for adolescents living with an eating disorder.
Missing Populations
While EDNOS and BED are estimated to be the most preva-
lent eating disorders (Deloitte Access Economics, 2012),
most research participants carried a diagnosis of AN.
Therefore, outcomes noted in these studies are more likely to
reflect the efficacy of these treatment approaches with AN
populations. The lack of research on BED may be attributed
to its recent recognition as a diagnosis distinct from EDNOS.
Awider range of participants with differing diagnoses should
be included in future studies to determine what works for
individuals living with a diagnosis other than AN.
Cultural factors were not discussed in any of the papers
and the cultural backgrounds of participants remain unknown.
Franko and George (2006) pointed to the influence of culture
and ethnicity upon the experiences of those in eating disorder
group therapy. This suggests the merit of considering cul-
tural factors in future research. Similarly, what became
apparent in reviewing the literature was that males were a
minority. This may reflect the broader prevalence statistics
and the findings that males are less likely to seek treatment
for an eating disorder (Deloitte Access Economics, 2012).
More research on cultural factors and male populations is
required to better understand the needs of these groups.
Adverse Effects
While MFT (Scholz et al., 2005) and the friends group
(Davies, 2004) promoted positive relational outcomes, the
emergence of unfavorable group dynamics was also
documented (Davies, 2004; Wood et al., 2011). This mirrors
Vandereycken's (2011) concerns regarding competition,
comparison, and social contagion in group therapy settings.
Davies commented upon the development of unhelpful alli-
ances between individuals and the development of competi-
tion between individuals. Competitiveness, perfectionism,
and low self-esteem among group members may exacerbate
eating disorders and jeopardize recovery (Vandereycken,
2011). Similarly, Wood et al. (2011) commented upon the
development of unhelpful group dynamics that negatively
affected the treatment group. Given the influence of peers
upon adolescents (Gusella, 1999), the risk of unhelpful alli-
ances, competitiveness, and social contagion may be particu-
larly salient for the treatment of this client group. Further
research on the positive and negative effects of group therapy
for adolescents is needed to reduce the potential harms of
this treatment approach.
Limitations
There are several limitations of this study. First, scoping
studies do not appraise the evidence included for review.
Therefore, the findings of this article can only be considered
to be descriptive rather than evaluative. Second, thematic
analysis is subjective, and this must be taken into account
when reviewing the findings. Third, the diagnostic criteria
for eating disorders have changed since the introduction of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(5th ed.; DSM-5; APA, 2013). This limits the application of
research outcomes to the newly defined eating disorders.
Finally, this study was conducted by a single reviewer and
the author notes selection bias as a key limitation of this
review.
Gaps and Recommendations
The results of this scoping review indicate that there is an
overall lack of research on group therapy for adolescents liv-
ing with an eating disorder. The findings suggest a need for
RCTs to test the validity of outcomes for all group therapy
models in this review. Program evaluations may serve as the
next step to establish outcomes for the program descriptions.
There is also a need to build an evidence base to support the
use of the many group therapy models used in practice that
remain untested. Research on adult populations may act as a
guide for directing future studies on adolescents. A system-
atic review may further inform research directions.
There are no studies investigating group treatments for
BED, and few measuring outcomes for EDNOS and BN.
With the addition of BED to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013),
research needs to direct efforts toward establishing effective
group treatments for this illness. Similarly, group models for
EDNOS, BN, and AN require further research.
Males were rarely included in studies and there was an
overall lack of discussion about the needs of culturally and
linguistically diverse individuals. Research on group models

treating adolescent males and culturally and linguistically
diverse individuals is needed to understand the needs of
these populations in a group treatment setting.
Finally, attrition and adverse treatment effects were noted
as key issues across the studies included in this review.
Gaining an understanding of the patterns that predict attrition
may strengthen engagement and improve outcomes for ado-
lescents living with an eating disorder. Similarly, research
exploring unhelpful group dynamics is needed to reduce the
likelihood of iatrogenic harms.
Conclusion
This review suggests that there is a gap in the literature
regarding the effectiveness of group therapy for adolescents
living with an eating disorder. There appears to be an assump-
tion of efficacy, which is surprising in an era of evidence-
based practice. Program evaluations are currently the highest
level of evidence in this area, with program descriptions sug-
gesting the value of undertaking more rigorous research. The
program evaluations suggested the utility of group therapy
for promoting weight restoration in underweight individuals
living with an eating disorder. Specifically, MFT showed
potential in the treatment of AN, whereas CBT showed
promise for adolescents living with BN. The following rec-
ommendations were made to inform the direction of future
research: (a) conduct RCTs to establish a stronger body of
evidence, (b) research group outcomes for all eating disor-
ders with particular attention to BED, (c) investigate group
programs in the treatment of males and culturally and lin-
guistically diverse populations, (d) explore patterns of attri-
tion, and (e) examine unhelpful dynamics that emerge in
group treatment contexts. There is still much to be known,
and it is hoped that these recommendations spark the interest
of researchers looking to make a meaningful contribution to
the field of eating disorders.
