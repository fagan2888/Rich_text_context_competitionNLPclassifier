Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the etiologies for dense vitreous hemorrhage in adults with non-traumatic
and reveal management of early vitrectomy for the disease.
Methods: Study included 105 eyes from 105 patients. Outcome measures were etiologies of
vitreous hemorrhage, formation of retinal and/or disk neovascular membrane (NVM), incidence of
retinal tear and detachment, visual acuity (VA) and postoperative complications.
Results: Mean time between presentation and surgery was 7.1 days. The most common etiologies
were retinal vein occlusion (RVO) (58.1%), retinal tear (22.9%) and retinal vasculitis (10.4%). Most
RVO (77.0%) and retinal vasculitis (72.7%) eyes were associated with retinal and/or disk NVM.
Retinal tear and retinal detachment was found in 24 and 48 eyes, respectively. VA improved
significantly from 1/70 to 0.6 following vitrectomy. The most common postoperative complication
was cataract (28.6%).
Conclusion: RVO, retinal tear and retinal vasculitis were the most common causes of dense
vitreous hemorrhage. Early vitrectomy has a good outcome with acceptable complication rates in
this setting.

Introduction
Vitreous hemorrhage is one of the most
common ocular disorders, causing a sudden,
painless loss of vision. Patients with a
fundus-obscuring vitreous hemorrhage,
which is generally caused by a retinal tear
or retinal vasculopathy, face a classic clinical
dilemma.1 Many clinicians favor a
conservative treatment, which involves
keeping the head in an upright position

combined with immobilization, to promote
settling and gradual absorption of the
blood.2,3 However, the conservative
approach for dense vitreous hemorrhage
has potential risks such as retinal detach-
ment, glaucoma and pigmentary retinop-
athy.4,5 To avoid these complications, many
clinicians prefer more aggressive treatment
with a vitrectomy or early vitrectomy.
As there have been few reports focused
on postoperative visual acuity (VA) and
complications arising from vitreous hemor-
rhage treatment, it is difficult to weigh the
risks and benefits of surgery. A previous
study showed the most common etiology of
vitreous hemorrhage in children was blunt
or penetrating trauma,6 while the main
causes of vitreous hemorrhage in adults
were posterior vitreous detachment and
diabetic retinopathy.2 While multiple studies
have investigated the prognosis for vitreous
hemorrhage caused by proliferative diabetic
retinopathy or trauma, less is known about
the outcomes for patients with dense
vitreous hemorrhage, even though it
frequently causes more devastating compli-
cations. Therefore, we undertook this study
to better understand the etiologies and visual
prognosis following early vitrectomy
for dense vitreous hemorrhage in adults
with non-traumatic and non-diabetic
retinopathy.
Methods
Ethics approval and patient recruitment
The study was approved by the institutional
review board of Shandong Eye Institute,
Jinan, China and conformed to the guide-
lines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Medical
records of patients who underwent early
vitrectomy for dense vitreous hemorrhage
between March 1, 2012 and March 1, 2014
were reviewed. All patients underwent a
comprehensive ophthalmic examination
including VA, applanation tonometry, slit-
lamp examination, gonioscopy, indirect
ophthalmoscopy and B-scan ultrasound.
The severity of vitreous hemorrhage was
scored on a 5-point scale, which was
modified from a previous study: Grade 0
(no vitreous hemorrhage); Grade 1 (minimal
vitreous hemorrhage, optic disk and retinal
vessels were clearly visible); Grade 2 (mild
vitreous hemorrhage, most of the optic disk
and retinal vessels were visible); Grade 3
(moderate vitreous hemorrhage, optic disk,
or retinal vessels were barely visible); Grade
4 (severe vitreous hemorrhage was too dense
to allow visualization of the optic disk).7,8
We included cases of adults who underwent
early vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage of
Grade 3 or 4 that had a follow-up of at least
6 months. We excluded cases of vitreous
hemorrhage caused by trauma or prolifera-
tive diabetic retinopathy.
Surgery and postoperative assessment
For these dense vitreous hemorrhage eyes,
surgery was carried out once a retinal tear or
detachment was detected. If no retinal tear
or detachment was found, we discussed
options with the patient and suggested a
vitrectomy if predisposing factors were
identified. If no tear or retinal detachment
was found and the patient had a history of
vascular disease in the eye, we advised a
vitrectomy if VA remained low and showed
no improvement for 1­3 weeks.
All patients were operated on at the
Shandong Eye Hospital, a tertiary academic
referral center. Data were retrieved from
the original medical record, including basic
patient information, clinical manifestation,
structured operation notes and standardized
fundus drawings. All operations were
performed by the same surgeon (G.Y.)
with the Alcon Accurus 800 (Alcon, USA).
Briefly, a standard three-port vitrectomy
was performed under retrobulbar or
general anesthesia, depending on the indi-
vidual preference of the surgeon. In the
combined procedures, we started with

ation of an intraocular lens. During vitrec-
tomy, meticulous shaving of the vitreous
base was done under a wide-angle viewing
system with assisted scleral indentation.
Fibrovascular tissue and tractional mem-
brane were removed using a combination of
segmentation and delamination, primarily
with an intraocular scissor or a microvitrec-
tor tip. Hemostasis was maintained by
raising intraocular pressure or by using
endodiathermy. For the retinal vein occlu-
sion eyes, laser photocoagulation was per-
formed. All tears were treated with laser
photocoagulation or external cryotherapy.
At the end of the surgery, balanced salt
solution, air, C2F6/C3F8 gas or silicone oil
was adopted as an intraocular tamponade
agent.
Postoperatively, patients were observed
every day for the first week, weekly for 4
weeks and monthly thereafter. VA and
complications were recorded during the
follow-up. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using SPSS software (version 16;
SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). VA before
and after surgery was compared using the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 105 patients (105 eyes) were
identified. The mean age of the patients
was 57.14 years (range, 28 years to 78 years).
There was no sex bias (58 female vs. 47 male)
or eye bias (57 left eyes vs. 48 right eyes). The
most common etiologies of dense vitreous
hemorrhage with non-traumatic and non-
diabetic retinopathy were retinal vein occlu-
sion (RVO)(61 eyes), retinal tear (24 eyes)
and retinal vasculitis (11 eyes). Other etiol-
ogies included polypoidal choroidal vascu-
lopathy (6 eyes) and retinal macroaneurysm
(3 eyes). The mean age of the patients with
RVO, retinal tear and retinal vasculitis was
59.4, 54.9, and 35.8 years, respectively, while
the mean age of the patients with polypoidal
choroidal vasculopathy and retinal macro-
aneurysm was 67.5 years for both. Among
the eyes with RVO, branch retinal vein
occlusion (BRVO) ranked first, with super-
ior temporal BRVO the predominant type
(Table 1).
During surgery, 47 eyes with RVO were
found to have neovascular membrane
(NVM). Of these, 33 eyes with BRVO, 2
eyes with central retinal vein occlusion
(CRVO) and 4 eyes with hemi CRVO were
found to have retinal NVM. Moreover, 2
eyes with CRVO had disk NVM and 6 eyes
with BRVO had both retinal and disk NVM.
Additionally, retinal NVM was also detected
in 8 eyes with retinal vasculitis. The results
demonstrated that most of the dense vitreous
hemorrhage eyes with RVO (77.0%) and
retinal vasculitis (72.7%) presented with ret-
inal and/or disk NVM (Table 2).
In the vitreous hemorrhage eyes, B-scan
ultrasound may discover a posterior vitre-
ous detachment, retinal tear or retinal
detachment and provide important

information for surgical decision-making. In
the present study, preoperative B-scan ultra-
sound revealed dense vitreous opacity in all
eyes, retinal tear in 5 eyes and retinal
detachment in 26 eyes. Intraoperatively,
retinal tear was found in 24 eyes and retinal
detachment was confirmed in 48 eyes.
B-scan ultrasound identified a retinal tear
or detachment in eyes with dense vitreous
hemorrhage in 20.8% and 54.2% of cases,
respectively.
Apart from determining the etiology of
dense vitreous hemorrhage, another area of
concern for the clinician is VA. In the present
study, VA was recorded preoperatively and
postoperatively. There was improvement in
VA in 100 of the 105 cases. The median
preoperative VA was 1/70 (logMAR: 1.85)
and the median postoperative VA was 0.6
(logMAR:0.22).Theimprovementislargeand
statistically significant (P< 0.001) (Table 3).
During the mean follow-up period of 14.5
months (range, 6 months to 2 years), 20 of
the 70 phakic eyes developed cataract.
Elevated intraocular pressure (over
21 mmHg) was present in 10 eyes, among
which nine were controlled by medication
and one eye with CRVO developed neovas-
cular glaucoma. Among all the cases, three
eyes had to be reoperated for a macular
pucker after 3 months and four eyes devel-
oped an inferior rhegmatogenous retinal
detachment at 2­3 months after surgery,
which was repaired by repeat vitrectomy.
Recurrences of vitreous hemorrhage were
noted in one eye with polypoidal choroidal
vasculopathy and one eye with retinal arter-
ial macroaneurysm at one month after sur-
gery, with both eyes achieving stability after
a second vitrectomy.
Discussion
Many clinicians favor a conservative strat-
egy for the management of vitreous hemor-
rhage as vitrectomy is an invasive procedure
with well-known risks, including cataract,
glaucoma, retinal tear or retinal detachment.
However, conservative treatment for a long-
standing dense vitreous hemorrhage may
cause marked visual disability due to the
toxic effect of the hemorrhage on the retina
and the formation of epiretinal membranes.
As surgery or conservative treatment has its
advantages and disadvantages, treatment of
dense vitreous hemorrhage poses a dilemma
to the ophthalmologist. The present study
was designed to investigate the etiology of
dense vitreous hemorrhage with non-trau-
matic and non-diabetic retinopathy and
determine the prognosis of early vitrectomy
for these patients.
Preoperatively, all the patients underwent
a B-scan ultrasound to look for the presence
of a posterior vitreous detachment, retinal
tear or retinal detachment. B-scan ultra-
sound is a well-established method for
evaluating vitreo-retinal anatomy in the
presence of vitreous hemorrhage. Its use in
detecting large retinal tears is well docu-
mented but in patients with small, multiple
tears or dense vitreous hemorrhage, its use is
limited.9 In this series, B-scan ultrasound
detected a preoperative retinal tear or retinal
detachment in 20.8% and 54.2% of cases,
respectively. Although dense vitreous hem-
orrhage may interfere with the accuracy of
the examination, B-scan ultrasound can still
provide important information to surgeons

to facilitate optimal surgical decision-making
and preoperative management.
Previous reports have shown that
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal
vasculitis and BRVO are the major causes
of vitreous hemorrhage in adults.2,5 The
etiologies encountered among our patients
were similar to those reported previously but
our study mainly focused on dense vitreous
hemorrhage with non-traumatic and non-
diabetic retinopathy. Our findings illu-
strated the most common etiologies for
these patients were RVO, retinal tear and
retinal vasculitis.
For dense vitreous hemorrhage asso-
ciated with a retinal tear or rhegmatogenous
retinal detachment, early surgery is recom-
mended as there is a higher incidence of
vitreoretinopathy and more likelihood of a
poorer visual outcome.10 For eyes with
dense vitreous hemorrhage, in which a ret-
inal tear cannot be ruled out, early surgery is
also advocated. A previous study demon-
strated that 67% of dense vitreous hemor-
rhage eyes appeared to have retinal tears and
even 39% had retinal detachment in a
conservative and prospective follow-up,
therefore delayed management can be asso-
ciated with an adverse visual outcome for
these patients.11,12
Along with retinal tears, we documented
other etiologies that were associated with
dense vitreous hemorrhage in the present
study, including RVO, retinal vasculitis,
polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and ret-
inal macroaneurysm. All these etiologies can
be attributed to an ocular vasculopathy. For
dense vitreous hemorrhage caused by a
retinal vasculopathy, the hypoxic retinal
tissue may produce vascular endothelial
growth factors (VEGF) and release inflam-
matory mediators, thereby inducing the
complications of macular pucker, tractional
retinal detachment and neovascular glau-
coma.13­16 There are several benefits to
performing early vitrectomy for vitreous
hemorrhage secondary to the retinal vascu-
lopathy, including RVO and retinal vascu-
litis. First, vitrectomy removes the opaque
vitreous hemorrhage and clears the visual
axis, which can improve vision. Second,
vitrectomy reduces the expression of
VEGF, which is a vital factor in neovascu-
larization. When vitrectomy is combined
with anti-VEGF agents or laser photo-
coagulation, it may improve the prognosis
from a dense vitreous hemorrhage.17­21
Third, thorough evaluation and treatment
of eyes with NVM may reduce complica-
tions that cause a decrease in vision, such as
tractional retinal detachment and macula-
off retinal detachment.22
Based on the results of this study, we
recommend an early vitrectomy for dense
vitreous hemorrhage with non-traumatic
and non-diabetic retinopathy. Early vitrec-
tomy can remove the opaque vitreous, clear
the visual axis and restore vision. However,
taking a more aggressive approach might
impose risks on individuals who could have
had a good outcome with conservative
treatment. Although the outcome for VA

a prospective, controlled study comparing
early versus late vitrectomy is needed to
draw firm conclusions and guide the clin-
ician on this significant issue.
