State Mental Health
Parity Laws: Cause Or
Consequence Of
Differences In Use?
States thatpass parity laws have fewerpersons usingmental
health services to begin with--which may explain theirpropensity
to legislate in this volatile area.
by Roland Sturm and Rosalie Liccardo Pacula
ABSTRACT: A new wave of state and federal legislation affecting mental health
insurance was passed during the 1990s. Although patient advocacy groups
have hailed the passage of numerous parity laws, it is unclear whether this
activity represents a major improvement in insurance benefits or significantly
increases access to mental health care. We investigated this issue with data
from two new national studies sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Founda-
tion. We found that states with below-average utilization were more likely to
enactstate legislation, bututilization in those states continues to lagbehind the
rest of the nation.
The 1990s brought a new wave of federal and state legis-
lative activity in mental health, this time primarily insurance
mandates that require covering mental health care at the same
level as medical care ("parity"). The enactment of a modest federal
mental health parity bill in 1996 was followed by more ambitious
state legislative activity. More than thirty states introduced parity
legislation in 1997 alone, and some form of parity mandate had been
adopted in nineteen states by 1998.1
Parity legislation was prompted at least in part by the growing
discrepancy between insurance benefits for mental health care and
for medical care. While medical plans generally do not place limits
on the number of covered outpatient visits or inpatient days, a typi-
cal employer-sponsored mental health plan in 1996 imposed several
limits, often including visit or hospital-day limits in addition to
annual or lifetime dollar limits. Similar discrepancies were found in

deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance rates, and this discrep-
ancy between mental and medical benefits has been growing.2
Mental health advocates had been lobbying for increased mental
health coverage since the 1950s. The eventual political success may
have been attributable to the confluence of political pressure from
consumer and patient organizations, the increased availability of
effective treatments, scientific findings of biological causes for sev-
eral serious psychiatric diseases, and the growth of managed care to
control costs. Although parity bills may represent important politi-
cal events and are widely celebrated by advocates, the new federal
and state legislation does not necessarily offer meaningful gains in
the efficiency and fairness of insurance markets: Richard Frank and
colleagues argue that policies aimed at mandating certain benefit-
design structures leave open to managed care many other ways to
influence a person's effective coverage.3 Recent empirical studies
support this argument by showing that employers switching to
managed care see dramatic drops in mental health costs even when
benefits are expanded.4
Nonetheless, employer and insurance interest groups claim that
mental health mandates are overly costly. The Health Insurance
Association of America (HIAA) has commissioned two studies that
associate mental health mandates (not just parity legislation) with
an increase of almost six percentage points in the uninsurance rate
and dramatic premium increases.5 These studies conflict with other
research, which finds that the average insurance mandate increases
uninsurance by about 0.04 percent and with recent data suggesting
that employers' cost for mental health benefits have been declining.6
They also conflict with findings from studies of employers' experi-
ence implementing full parity under managed care.7
One reason for the discrepancy in findings is a difference in the
data that are used. Some industry studies use cross-sectional data
and examine differences across states, while other studies analyze
longitudinal data and look at changes over time.8 The distinction is
important. Cross-sectional analyses ignore initial differences across
states in utilization and costs that existed prior to legislation. All
differences after legislation are assumed to be generated by the legis-
lation. However, the passage of any legislation is the result of a
political process. The laws that were enacted (and bills that failed)
are likely to reflect at least in part the balance between competing
interest groups. Longitudinal comparisons may control for initial
structural differences in utilization and costs by focusing on incre-
mental changes from a base year before the legislation passed, which
can influence the outcome.
In this paper we study whether this endogeneity of legislation is

important or whether cross-sectional analyses are adequate to esti-
mate the effect of state parity legislation. Using data from two new
national studies funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
(RWJF), HealthCare for Communities (HCC) and the Community
Tracking Study (CTS), we examine differences in private insurance
coverage, mental health status, and use of mental health care serv-
ices across states with and without state parity legislation.
Background On Mental Health Parity Legislation
There are two important pieces to mental health parity policy:
federal and state legislation. Although several prior attempts to
mandate equal coverage for mental health at the federal level had
failed, in 1996 supporters of mental health mandates were able to
add an amendment (Title VII--Parity in the Application of Certain
Limits to Mental Health Benefits) to an unlikely bill, the Depart-
ments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development,
and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act. The amendment,
which became known as the Mental Health Parity Act, took effect in
January 1998. The law was hailed by patient advocates, who cele-
brated that "[t]he days of [mental health patients'] being cast as
second-class citizens from a health care system historically indiffer-
ent to their needs are over," and by politicians, who believed that it
would help to "eradicate the stigma that is commonly placed on
mental health patients" and "wash away the deep rooted ignorance
of thinking that mental illness is due to some sinful behavior."9
Unfortunately, it is not clear that these expectations have been
met. The Parity Act does not require employers to offer mental
health coverage, only that dollar limits on coverage have to be equal
to dollar limits on medical benefits if mental health coverage is
offered. Nor does the act impose any conditions on deductibles,
copayments, or limits on days or visits, or require coverage for sub-
stance abuse. This leaves employers and insurers many options to
react to the law, including dropping mental health benefits alto-
gether. The law also exempts plans if the application of the law
would result in a cost increase of at least 1 percent of total medical
costs, and it exempts small employers (fifty or fewer workers).
Of course, removing dollar limits could be a major expansion in
benefits for the most severely ill, who are most at risk of losing
insurance coverage. Among the privately insured population, this
primarily means the child dependents of policyholders.10 However,
no such expansion may occur if employers and insurance plans com-
pensate for it by imposing other constraints. Benefit consulting
firms have been advising their clients to impose actuarially equiva-
lent day or visit limits, for example, thus replacing an annual limit of

$25,000 with a limit of forty inpatient days. In a preliminary analysis
of mental health and substance abuse benefits of 137 employer-spon-
sored plans before and after 1 January 1998, we found that the
number of network limits expressed in dollars dropped from an
average of 2.0 to 0.6 (the remaining dollar limits affecting substance
abuse care). However, the average number of limits on inpatient
days increased from 0.8 to 1.4, and the number of limits on outpa-
tient visits increased from 0.5 to 0.9.11 Insiders in the managed care
industries confirm that this restructuring of benefits, rather than
expanding benefits, is the most common response by employers.12
The second piece of the parity puzzle is state legislation. Between
1991 and 1996 five states passed mental illness parity mandates
(Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island).
In 1997 thirty-four states introduced parity legislation, which be-
came law in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, South
Carolina, Texas, and Vermont, and an additional four states passed
parity legislation in 1998 (Delaware, Georgia, South Dakota, and
Tennessee) (Exhibit 1). Some of the state laws are symbolic in na-
ture and mirror the federal legislation, perhaps anticipating it by a
few months (such as in Arizona, Indiana, and South Carolina).
Other state mandates are more demanding (and potentially more
costly to employers) than the Parity Act. However, state regulations
do not apply to self-insured health plans, which are subject to the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974. ERISA
preempts states from regulating employer provisions of health
plans. However, states can regulate third-party health insurers.
Many large employers are self-insured; thus, many Americans with
health coverage through a private employer are in plans that are not
subject to state mandates. This means that even strict state-level
parity laws will not affect most people.
Data And Methods
We analyze data from two RWJF-funded national surveys.13
HCC is a project designed to identify variations and track changes
in health care over time, with a primary focus on mental health and
substance abuse care, while the CTS is focused on tracking changes
in the medical care system. The two studies are tied together, since
the CTS, which has more than 60,000 participants, was used to
construct the sampling frame for the HCC survey. A random sample
of approximately 25 percent of the adult participants in the CTS
was selected for the HCC survey and interviewed between Septem-
ber 1997 and November 1998. This analysis uses a prerelease version
of the HCC household survey with 9,661 respondents (a public re-
lease file is expected for December 1999) and the public release file of

the much larger CTS.
We first identified whether the interview took place before or
after a parity law became effective. By matching interview dates and
effective dates for legislation, we were able to define a dummy vari-
able for all of those living in states that passed some form of parity
legislation that became effective prior to the interview date (see
Exhibit 1). No one in our sample was interviewed after November
1998, so we did not evaluate laws listed in Exhibit 1 that were passed
after this date. Approximately one-third of our sample lived in a
state that passed some form of parity legislation, and 73 percent of
the HCC sample were interviewed after federal parity legislation
became effective. For sensitivity analysis, we also considered three
alternative definitions of state parity legislation. The first is meant to
capture only those states that passed legislation that exceeds the
federal law in some dimension, although it may have other loopholes
or exemptions. Using this "stricter" definition of parity, only 17 per-
cent of our sample lived in a state with an expanded parity law. Two
other specifications of parity legislation indicate whether the inter-
view took place either three months or six months after the legisla-
tion passed. These measures are dummy variables set equal to one
only if a state's parity law had been in existence at the time of
interview for (1) at least three months or (2) at least six months.
These two post­parity legislation indicators would pick up more
long-term adjustments in access, utilization, and private insurance
coverage that could be attributed to the law, not just short-term
changes. None of our main findings presented here is sensitive to
these alternative definitions. Finally, because parity legislation is
aimed at private insurance through employer mandates, all of our
analyses were done on both the full sample and a subsample of
privately insured persons.
The main variables related to health care utilization analyzed
from the HCC survey are (1) private insurance versus no insurance
or public insurance; (2) any use of mental health care in the past
twelve months (including primary care providers); (3) any use of
mental health specialty care in past twelve months; (4) insurance
coverage of mental health specialty visits; and (5) number of mental
health specialty visits among users.14 Because it also is possible to
construct measures of mental health status in the HCC survey, we
also examined mental health status as indicated by the mental
health inventory scale from the Medical Outcomes Study.15 This
scale represents a person's general mental well-being as indicated by
the mean score of five questions inquiring of that person's (emo-
tional) feelings during the past four weeks. A higher score suggests
better feelings.

Unfortunately, many of the mental health indicators available in
the HCC survey cannot be constructed from the CTS data. The one
mental health utilization item that can be derived from both surveys
is the use of any mental health specialty care in the past twelve
months. Further, the CTS includes only two of the five questions
used to construct the complete mental health inventory scale in the
HCC survey. However, it is possible to construct a similar mental
health status indicator using these two questions in both surveys.
We therefore constructed a second measure of mental health status,
in which distress is indicated by frequently feeling "down and blue"
or by infrequently feeling "calm and peaceful." A higher score here
indicates greater distress.

eral mental health status across states with and without parity leg-
islation using either measure of mental health status. Despite virtu-
ally identical levels in these key demand indicators, the remaining
descriptive statistics show that significant differences exist in ac-
cess to and use of mental health care. The proportion of persons
reporting any mental health care (which could be in primary care) or
any mental health specialty care is lower in states that have passed
parity legislation. Similarly, we found that among persons who re-
ceived some mental health care, those living in states with parity
laws had almost two fewer visits to specialists. When we restricted
our sample to just the privately insured, we found that the mental
health status index gets smaller (better mental health), but this was
true for both types of states, and there was no significant difference
between parity and nonparity states. In contrast, all of the differ-
ences in measures of mental health services use remain statistically
significant, and the difference in the number of mental health spe-
cialty visits gets even larger.
Regarding insurance for mental health specialty care among us-
ers, fewer patients in parity states had those visits covered by insur-
ance. When we restricted the sample to only the privately insured,
the difference was no longer statistically significant. The drop in
significance, however, is more likely due to the smaller sample size
than to the absence of a substantively meaningful effect size.
The finding that parity states have generally lower rates of utili-
zation than nonparity states have, despite similar indicators of men-
tal health care demand, contradicts what we would have expected.
Clearly, if there were a one-way causality from legislation to utiliza-
tion, the latter should be higher in states that have more mandated
benefits and coverage. However, these differences in descriptive sta-
tistics may be driven by other confounding factors that have not
been accounted for, such as age, sex, income, ethnicity, insurance,
region, federal parity legislation, general mental health status, or
other chronic health conditions. Multivariate logistic regression
analyses reveal that these statistically significant differences persist
even after these potentially confounding factors are controlled for.
The results presented in Exhibit 2, taken at face value, are incon-
sistent with the notion that parity legislation increases utilization
and therefore costs. It seems implausible, however, that the enact-
ment of parity legislation leads to lower rates of utilization. Instead,
"The difference in use of mental health services between states
before and after legislation is almost identical."

the results strongly suggest reverse causality--namely, that states
lagging behind the nation in use of mental health care were more
likely to pass parity laws. The passage of parity legislation, or any
mental health mandate, is the result of a political process, with
patient advocacy groups and provider organizations generally
working for it and employer and insurance associations generally
working against it. States that were able to pass legislation may have
had lower utilization to begin with, thereby motivating proponents
to push hard for the legislation, or fewer affected persons, thereby
reducing opposition to the legislation.
Because it is impossible to account for reverse causality with
cross-sectional data, one must be cautious interpreting the results
presented in Exhibit 2. The issue can be resolved only through the
use of panel data. Since the larger CTS is the precursor to the HCC
survey, we do have some information on insurance and utilization
across states two years before the HCC survey and before many
states enacted parity legislation.
It would be useful to examine differences in mental health need
and use of specialty services between states that eventually enacted
parity legislation during the two years between the surveys and
those that did not. Several states had already enacted parity legisla-
tion at the time of the CTS, however. To make this evaluation as
clean as possible, we decided to contrast states that eventually
passed parity legislation with all other states. The definition of parity
states in Exhibit 3, therefore, is slightly different than in Exhibit 2.
Exhibit 3 reports the findings from simple descriptive statistics
for the CTS sample. Again we found no statistically significant dif-
ference between the two types of states in the rate of private insur-

ance or in the mental health status index. However, for both the full
sample and the privately insured sample, the rate of any mental
health specialty care in the previous twelve months was signifi-
cantly higher in states that were not going to pass a state parity bill
than in states that were going to enact some state legislation. More-
over, this difference of 1.5­1.7 percentage points is almost identical
to the difference between the two types of states in Exhibit 2, which
is based on data collected after the state legislation had been in force
(and, for most respondents, after the federal Mental Health Parity
Act had been effective as well).
Conclusions
We draw two main conclusions. First, the results provide some
empirical support of the political-economy argument as to why
states pass parity laws. Those that do have fewer people using men-
tal health care services to begin with, and this is not related to
differences in population characteristics or sickness levels. We
tested for an association between legislation and supply as meas-
ured by the number of psychiatrists per thousand persons, number
of psychologists per thousand persons, or health maintenance or-
ganization (HMO) penetration, but we found none. Second, any
positive effect that state parity legislation may have on utilization is
too minor to overcome the initial difference in utilization that exists
between states with and without legislation. In fact, the difference
between states before and after legislation is almost identical.
This study provides a good reminder of the limitations of cross-
sectional studies pertaining to the effects of health regulations and
legislation. Because legislation is the result of a political process,
with very vocal interest groups on both sides of an issue, cross-
sectional findings of the effects of legislation are prone to be misun-
derstood and may even be misused for political purposes.

14. The items were based on a initial screener question of any mental health use
and then more detailed questions on specialty use among any users. This
differs from the survey approaches in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area
(ECA) study and the National Comorbidity Study (NCS), which asked about
use for specific providers and then summed up. However, one can construct
HCC items that are comparable to the NCS (not reported here), and the
utilization rates are then comparable. See R.C. Kessler et al., "Past-Year Use of
Outpatient Services for Psychiatric Problems in the National Comorbidity
Survey," American Journal of Psychiatry 156, no. 1 (1999): 115­123; and D.A. Regier

16. The rate of uninsurance is less than in other recent national studies. For
example, Sloan and Conover report uninsurance rates of 18 percent in the early
1990s. Sloan and Conover, "Effects of State Reforms." Some of this may be due
to differences in surveys, but the strong economy and low unemployment
rates together with stable or even decreasing health care costs to employers
are likely to have reduced the number of persons without insurance. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics civilian labor force unemployment rate dropped
from 7.8 percent in June 1992 (about the middle of the period analyzed by
Sloan and Conover) to 4.5 percent in June 1998 during the HCC survey period.
