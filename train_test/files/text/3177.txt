The capital-asset-pricing model (CAPM) is one of the most popular methods of
financial market analysis. But, evidence of the poor empirical performance of the
CAPM has accumulated in the literature. For example, based on their empirical
results regarding the relation between market Beta and average return, Fama and
French (1996) conclude that the CAPM is no longer a useful tool for empirical
financial market analysis. Most empirical studies of the conventional CAPM take,
however, neither the fat-tails of return data nor the price relationship between an
asset of interest and the bench market portfolio into account.
In the framework of a univariate Beta-model we consider a stable long-run CAPM
taking account of the fat-tails of stock returns and the common stochastic trends
between stock prices. Using the same data used by Fama and French (1996), the
stable long-run CAPM demonstrates that Markowitz rule of the expected returns
and variance of returns can (still) --without any use of firm specific variables--
explain the variation of the cross-sectional average returns.

and the cross-section of expected returns1
1 Introduction
Central banks are more and more concerned with the financial market because of
its importance not only for their monetary policy, but also for the regulation of
financial institutions regarding risk management. Despite numerous theoretical and
empirical criticisms, the capital-asset-pricing model (CAPM) has been and is still
one of the most popular standard tools for financial researchers and practitioners
to quantify the trade-off between risk and expected return in financial markets.
Markowitz (1952) argues that investors would optimally hold a portfolio with the
highest expected return for a given risk. Based on the so-called mean-variance ef-
ficient portfolio, Sharpe (1965) and Lintner (1966) develop the well-known Sharpe
and Lintner version of CAPM (henceforth, Sharpe/Lintner CAPM or conventional
CAPM), in which the expected return of an asset must be linearly related to the
covariance of its return with the return of the market portfolio. The economic the-
ory for the CAPM is intuitively clear and the empirical implication of the CAPM is
plausible, since risky assets will usually yield higher returns than investment free of
risk. In line with many reports on anomalies in the 70s and 80s, however, evidence
of the poor empirical performance of the conventional CAPM has accumulated in
the literature. More recently, based on their empirical results regarding the relation
between market Beta and average return, Fama and French (1992, 1996) have de-
clared the end of the CAPM as an empirical tool for the analysis of trade-off relations
between risk and returns on stocks. To improve the empirical performance of the
conventional CAPM, some modifications are also considered in the literature. Most
of the modifications are performed by including some firm specific variables such as
firm-size in Banz (1981) and book-to-market ratio in Fama and French (1992). Some
of the modifications are based on another probability principle (without any firm
specific variables), such as the time-varying market Beta by Jagannathan and Wang
(1996). Guo and Whitelaw (2000), for example, consider a structural asset-pricing
model in the context of time series, and find a significant positive relationship be-
tween return and risk. See, for more debate about the CAPM, a nice summary
paper of Jagannathan and McGrattan (1995).
In this paper, we consider a possible modification of the conventional CAPM to
improve its empirical performance. For this modification, we examine properties of
empirical financial data and take them into account:

· since the influential works of Mandelbrot (1963), the infinite­variance sta-
ble Paretian (usually -stable) distribution2 has often been considered to be
a more realistic distribution for asset returns than the normal distribution,
because asset returns are typically fat­tailed and excessively peaked around
zero--phenomena that can be captured by -stable distributions with  < 2.
· Second, the conventional CAPM is based on (excess) returns and, hence, con-
tains no information of stock prices. Note that returns are first difference of
log-prices3 and the log-prices are typically assumed to be random walks (more
precisely, martingale). When two stock prices (although each of them follows
a random-walk process) have a common stochastic trend and build a long-
run equilibrium, one can use this level information to improve the empirical
performance of the CAPM.
The modified version of the conventional CAPM introduced in this paper will there-
fore be based on the empirical evidence for the -stable distributed stock returns
and the common stochastic trends between stock prices and, hence, may be called
an (-) stable long-run CAPM (SLCAPM). Consequently, the SLCAPM contains
not only the (usual) market Beta as a short-run market Beta, but also a long-run
market Beta in terms of a long-run relationship, and the returns are allowed to be
non-normally distributed. An empirical application of the SLCAPM for the Ger-
man Stock Index (DAX) will show how the stable long-run market Beta can be
used for measuring risks. In order to demonstrate the empirical performance of the
SLCAPM, we compare our model with some well-known alternative CAPMs such
as the book-to-market CAPM by Fama and French (1992, 1996) (henceforth, BM-
CAPM4) and the conditional CAPM of Jagannathan and Wang (1996) (henceforth,
CCAPM). Using the same data as Fama and French (1992) and Jagannathan and
Wang (1996), it turns out that the SLCAPM explains --without any firm specific
variables such as firm-size, book-to-market equity and/or human labour-- over 60
percent of the cross-sectional variation in average returns. This result is compared
with that of the BMCAPM, which explains (with two firm specific variables, firm-
size and book-to-market equity) 55.12 percent of the cross-sectional variation in
average returns and the CCAPM, which captures nearly 30 percent without firm
specific variables and 55.21 percent with one firm specific variable, human labour.
As the main result of this paper, it turns out that the stable long-run market Beta
contributes a substantial improvement in the empirical performance of the conven-
tional CAPM and the SLCAPM still conforms to the original spirit of Markowitz
2A brief overview of the -stable distribution is given in Section 2.2.
3Letting Pt denote the price of an asset at time t and assuming no dividends, the return over
period (t - 1, t] is typically modelled as rt = 100 × log(Pt
/Pt-1).
4This kind of modification is usually called a multifactor model in the literature.

(1952), namely the mean-variance rule.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present empirical
evidence for -stable distributions in financial data and give a short summary of
-stable distributions. We also examine the existence of long-run relationships in
empirical financial data and discuss the compatibility of the long-run relationships
and market efficiency. In Section 3, we introduce the SLCAPM. Estimation of
the short-run market Beta and the long-run market Beta as well as tests for the
validity of the SLCAPM are discussed. Section 4 shows an empirical application of
the SLCAPM. In Section 5, using the cross-sectional regression method by Fama
and MacBeth (1973) a substantial improvement in the empirical performance of the
conventional CAPM through the SLCAPM is presented. Section 6 summarizes the
paper and contains some concluding remarks.
2 Empirical evidence
In this Section we examine the empirical properties of returns and asset prices
and present evidence of fat-tails in returns and long-run relationships (common
stochastic trends) in prices.
2.1 Fat-tails
It is now well-known that most financial data (high-frequency data) have thicker
tails in their density than those of the normal density. For a demonstration of
the phenomenon we take two data sets which we will use in our empirical analysis
later. One of them is the daily returns of the DAX from June 19, 1989 to June
18, 1999, and the other monthly returns of the CRSP data. Figure 1 shows the daily
stock prices, returns and the empirical density of the returns (solid line) compared
with the standard normal density (dotted line). The return process shows some
volatility clustering. In fact, the empirical density of the returns is excessively
peaked around zero, and at the same time has thicker tails than those of the normal
density. The conditional heteroscedasticity in Figure 1b results in the fat-tails in
the unconditional density in Figure 1c. Figure 2 shows the same results as Figure 1.
See, for more illustration and discussion on fat-tails in economic variables, Rachev,
Kim and Mittnik (1998).
2.2 A short summary of -stable Distributions
-stable distributions, as a generalization of the normal distribution, are described
by four parameters (, b, , µ) with   (0, 2], b  [-1, 1],   (0, ] and µ 
3
(-, ).5 The shape of the -stable distribution is determined completely by the
stability (or tail-thickness) parameter , when b = 0. Skewness is governed by the
skewness parameter, b, the symmetric case corresponding to b = 0. The scale and
location parameter of the distributions are denoted by  and µ. For  = 2, the
-stable distribution reduces to the normal distribution with variance 22 and, for
 = 1 and b = 0, Cauchy distribution. For  < 2 all moments of order  or higher
are infinite and tails become thicker, i.e., the magnitude and frequency of outliers
increase as  decreases. Thus, a stable distribution has no finite variance except
 = 2 (i.e., the normal distribution is the only member of the -stable family with
finite variance), and no finite mean when   1. Closed-form expressions of -
stable distributions exist only for a few special cases.6 However, the logarithm of
the characteristic function of the -stable distribution can be written as
ln (t) =



-|t|[1 - ib sign(t)tan
2
] + iµt, for  = 1,
-|t|[1 + ib
2
sign(t) ln |t|] + iµt, for  = 1.
All probability density functions of stable distributions are continuous (Gnedenko
and Kolmogorov, 1954) and unimodal (Ibragimov and Linnik, 1970). Moreover, the
support of all stable distributions is (-, ), except if  = 1 and b = ±1, where
the support is (-, 0) for b = -1 and (0, ) for b = 1 (Feller, 1971). For more
details on the -stable distributions see Zolotarev (1986) and Samorodnitsky and
Taqqu (1994). It is worth noting that a strong argument in favour of the -stable
distribution for financial modelling over any other fat-tailed distributions such as
t-distribution is that only the -stable distribution can serve as limiting distribution
of sums of independent identically distributed random variables (Zolotarev, 1986).
The estimated stability parameter for the daily DAX in Figure 1 is 1.81, 1.84
and 1.80, and for the monthly CRSP in Figure 2 1.82, 1.87 and 1.88, according to
the maximum-likelihood estimation (DuMouchel, 1973), the Hill estimation (Hill,
1975) and the quantile estimation (McCulloch, 1986), respectively.
2.3 Common stochastic trends
To check possible common trends in asset prices, we test for integration in each
asset price, including DAX, and for co-integration in each univariate Beta model.
For the unit roots test, Dickey/Fuller test (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) and KPSS test
(Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin, 1992) are applied, where the Dickey/Fuller
test assumes non-stationarity under the null, whereas the KPSS test stationarity.
For co-integration test, we apply the usual t-test, i.e. t-test of the loading coefficient
5To avoid confusing with the market Beta, , of the CAPM, b denotes the skewness parameter
instead of the usually used .
6The normal distribution ( = 2), Cauchy distribution ( = 1, b = 0) and L´
evy distribution
( = 0.5, b = 1) belong to the special cases.

for the co-integration residuals pre-estimated and the so-called tECM
-test, considered
in Banerjee, Dolado and Mestre (1998).
The first two columns of Table 1 show the result of tests for unit roots. The
results of tests for co-integration are summarized in the last two columns. None of
the 30 stock prices can be regarded as a stationary process by the two tests used.7
The two tests for co-integration show somewhat different results. About one-half
of the individual series is co-integrated with DAX at 90% significant level by the
t-test, while about two-thirds by the tECM
-test. Note that in a dynamic setting the
tECM
-test is a more powerful test than the usual t-test (see, for more details on this
topic, Kremers, Ericsson and Dolado, 1992). 7 assets are not co-integrated with
DAX according to any of the tests. As the result shows, the empirical evidence for
co-integration is, however, not very strong. A possible explanation is given: Shiller
and Perron (1985) explore the power of unit root tests with respect to span and
frequency of observation, and conclude that the test power depends more on the
span of the data than on the number of observations. They also summarize that
if the span is held fixed as the number of observations is increased, power tends
towards the size of test. This means that the high frequency data with a short span
(this is the case for our empirical analysis, namely 252 observations during only one
year, which corresponds, for example, to 12 observations for monthly data) are not
long enough to detect a long-run relationship.
2.4 The common stochastic trend and the efficient market
hypothesis
The analysis of co-integration, introduced by Engle und Granger (1987) in financial
data, is not new, and there are many empirical works which report the existence of
co-integrating relationships in financial data; see, for example, Corhay, Rad and Ur-
bain (1993). According to the co-integration theory, many economic time series are
non-stationary (integrated), but a certain linear combination of them can be station-
ary, i.e., co-integrated. If more than two economic time series are co-integrated, one
can use this stationary property of the relation among the time series and perform a
forecasting exercise with a finite forecast error. I.e., the existence of co-integration
can generally be interpreted as predictability, which is not compatible with the effi-
cient market hypothesis (EMH) in the sense of Samuelson (1965) and Fama (1970).
Samuelson (1965) argues that, in an informationally efficient market, price changes
must be unpredictable if they fully incorporate the expectations and information
of all market participants. Based on this idea, Fama (1970) develops the concept
of market efficiency designated in the literature as EMH. The alleged inconsistency
7The result remains unchanged when using the critical values taking non-normality into account
in Mittnik, Kim and Rachev (1997).
5
between co-integration and EMH has been critically debated by many authors in
recent years. Three viewpoints on this issue are in order.
The first group of authors argues that the findings of co-integration in financial
markets imply a violation of market efficiency. Baillie and Bollerslev (1989, 1994),
for example, find (fractional) co-integration in nominal dollar spot exchange rates
and MacDonald and Power (1993) in monthly prices for the shares of 40 companies
in the UK. Using the monthly averaged stock-price indexes of nine major industrial
countries, Masih and Masih (2001) find a causal transmission among the indexes in
the context of error-correction models. In a slightly different setting, Bollerslev and
Engle (1993) analyze co-persistence in the conditional variance between more than
two return processes, indicating a direct predictability of the conditional variance.
The authors in this group, therefore, believe in the predictability of financial data
and ignore the EMH.
The second group of authors asserts the impossibility of co-integration in finan-
cial market theoretically and/or shows no co-integration empirically. Based on the
incompatibility between the predictability of co-integration and the unpredictability
of EMH, Granger (1992) and Diebold, Gardeazabel and Yilmaz (1994) deny the ex-
istence of co-integration relationships among the financial data. Granger (1992, p. 3)
wrote that "· · · then price changes would be consistently predictable, and so a money
machine is created and indefinite wealth is possible". The argument of Granger is
based on the logic that co-integration is a causal relationship which contains at
least one exogenous variable and, hence, co-integration would necessarily imply pre-
dictability. Diebold et al. (1994) find a contradictory result in comparison with that
of Baillie and Bollerslev (1989), who used the same data and found evidence of
co-integration.8 Based on a vector autoregressive error-correction model, Barkoulas
and Baum (1997) present empirical evidence of no co-integration of foreign exchange
markets.
Note that the EMH must not only be defined by unpredictability, and that the
existence of co-integration must not necessarily imply predictability, either. The
third group of authors emphasizes, therefore, the consistency of the EMH and co-
integration. Fama (1991) argues that the predictability of stock returns from div-
idend does not in itself yield evidence for or against market efficiency. Using the
moving-average representation of co-integrated variables, Dwyer and Wallace (1992)
demonstrate that co-integration in financial markets can be consistent with market
efficiency, and argue that there is no general equivalence between market efficiency
and co-integration, or a lack of co-integration. Engle (1996) also discusses pre-
dictability in an efficient market, and concludes that co-integration has nothing to
do with EMH.
8In a later paper of Baillie and Bollerslev (1994), this contradiction is resolved through the
introduction of fractional co-integration.
6
We likeweise claim that co-integration is compatible with EMH. Co-integration
does not necessarily enable us to predict variables in a co-integrated model when
data­generating processes of asset prices are driven by fundamentals. Regarding pre-
dictability, Crowder (1994) emphasizes the role of exogeneity and causality in a co-
integrating relationship. Caporale and Pittis (1998) correctly argue that (given one-
directional causality and exogeneity, which is usually assumed for a co-integrating
relationship) k variables can be predicted in an n-dimensional co-integrating sys-
tem with k co-integrating relationships. When both the price of market portfolio
Pt
and the price of an individual asset pt
are driven by fundamentals which are
not specified in a co-integrating relationship, the direction of causality between Pt
and pt
cannot be observed in one direction, but maybe (detected by tests) partly
in one direction and partly in the other. This is a very plausible scenario because
each individual asset price is contained in the market price. Moreover, it is not
easy in high-frequency data to distinguish cause from effect and vice versa. The
causal structure in this case will then be detected by the usual tests, as if they
have an instantaneous causality. We examine this kind of causality in the empirical
data using Geweke's measure (Geweke, 1982) of causality9, which is also adopted in
Bracker, Docking and Koch (1999), and the cross-correlation test of Hong (2001).
The result of Geweke's measure of causality for the DAX is summarized in Table
2. The first column of Table 2 shows the causality of DAX to each individual asset.
Few of them are significantly caused by the DAX. The second column shows the
causality of the reverse direction. Few individual assets are causal to the DAX,
9This test is a likelihood-ratio test performing usually bivariate case, say x and y, assumes no
causality under the null, and causality of one variable to the other under the alternative. The
likelihood value, under the restriction 2
u
, come from the restricted model
xt = a0 +
p
i=1
ai
xt-i + ut
,
and, under no restrictions, 2
e
results from the unrestricted model
xt = a0 +
p
i=1
ai
xt-i +
q
j=1
bj
yt-j + et
.
The test statistic is formulated as the likelihood ratio of the restricted and unrestricted variance
LR = n ln(2
u
/2
e
), which is asymptotically 2(q)-distributed. For a large value of the likelihood
ratio, y is causal to x. If x and y in the equations above are rotated, one tests whether x is causal to
y under the alternative hypothesis. In the framework of seemingly unrelated regression equations,
one can also detect instantaneous causality based on the likelihood-ratio statistic. For this case, the
likelihood value under restriction is the product of two 2
u
s resulting from two restricted models of x
and y; and the determinant of the residual covariance matrix of the seemingly unrelated regression
equations under no restriction. This residual covariance matrix is usually estimated with the
feasible generalized ordinary least squares method (Zellner, 1962), which reduces to ordinary least
squares under null hypothesis.
7
either. The Granger-causality between DAX and its individual assets seems to be
very weak. The third column shows instantaneous causality. All individual assets
are instantaneously causal to the DAX. This can be seen as empirical evidence of
the co-existence of common stochastic trends and market efficiency. For this case,
co-integration does not imply the predictability of any variables in the system, al-
though the forecasting of the stationary equilibrium error with a finite forecasting
error is still possible. Stock and Watson (2001) examine empirical evidence of the
forecasting ability of asset prices and conclude that some asset prices predict · · · in
some countries in some periods. Which series predicts what, when and where is,
however, itself difficult to predict. Most empirical evidence, as summarized in Stock
and Watson (2001), shows that · · · a significant Granger causality statistic contains
little or no information about whether the indicator has been a reliable predictor. In
line with that conclusion and the empirical evidence of Stock and Watson (2001), we
conclude the co-existence of co-integration and MEH, because predictability does
not necessarily mean creating a money machine, as Granger (1992) worries.
3 The stable long-run CAPM
3.1 The model
Let r denote the (excess) return on an asset and R be the return on the market
portfolio of all assets in an economy. The Black version of the Sharpe/Lintner
CAPM (Black, 1972) accounting for the absence of the risk-free asset is formulated10
E[r] = 0
+ 1
, (1)
where  is defined as
 = Cov[r, R]/Var[R]. (2)
The fundamental, R, is usually specified as a benchmark portfolio for financial
market analysis in practice. Based on the empirical evidence surveyed above, the
conventional CAPM can be modified by the following assumptions.
Assumption 1 The asset return r is symmetric -stable (S
S) distributed with
  (1, 2].
The assumption 1 is a (stable) generalization of the traditional distributional as-
sumption of normality on financial returns since Bachelier (1900). The restriction,
  (1, 2], is needed because there exists no first moment when   1. This restric-
tion, however, does not describe a real restriction for empirical financial analysis,
because the stability parameters of most financial returns lie between 1.5 and 1.9.
10For simplicity, the firm index is suppressed.
8
The restriction of symmetry (b = 0) is needed to avoid complications for estima-
tions and tests of the ex-post SLCAPM. The following Lemma follows assumption
1 immediately.
Lemma 1 The asset price, pt
, follows a L´
evy motion with an increment between t
and s p(t) - p(s)  S(, 0, (t - s)1/, 0) for 0  s < t < .
The L´
evy motion is also a (stable) generalization of Brownian motion, whose incre-
ments are normally distributed. For more details on properties of L´
evy motion, see
Resnick (1986, p. 72).
Assumption 2 Each pair of the two returns, rt
and Rt
, is bivariate symmetric
distributed.
Assumption 2 implies that the two L´
evy motions have the same . This means
that all assets in a benchmark, including the benchmark itself, must have the same
stability parameter.11 Assumption 2 ensures the linearity of the relationship between
expected return and risk under assumption 1. See, for more details on the relation
between symmetry and linearity, Theorem 4.1.2 in Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994,
p. 175). The next assumption concerns the relationships between asset prices.
Assumption 3 For each pair of the two L´
evy motions, pt
and Pt
, there exists a
constant c, so that the linear combination
pt
- cPt
 zt
,
where zt
is an -stable distributed stationary process.
Assumption 3 means a stationary relationship between level variables, and, hence,
implies the explanatory power of the correction of the disequilibrium in level for the
expected return. Under assumption 3, equation 1 can be written as
E[r] = 0
+ 1
s + 2
l, (3)
where s and l are defined as
s = [r, R]
/
R
and l = [p, P]
/
P
(4)
11For a small sample, it is actually more or less restrictive. But there is no reason --either
economically or statistically-- why each asset has different 's just as all assets have the same
. All assets in a benchmark are influenced by the same market events, so that `the same ' is
more possible. On the other hand, one can also argue that the firm-specific influence is stronger
than the general market trend, so that `the different ' is more possible. If two variables in the
bivariate Beta model have different s, the statistical dealing of the bivariate SLCAPM is much
more complicated (but tractable).
9
respectively. Above, [r, R]
([p, P]
) is covariation of r and R (p and P), and R
(P
)
is variation of R (P). Covariation (variation) is a stable generalization of the concept
of covariance (variance) of the normally distributed random variables. See, for more
details on covariation and variation, Samorodnitsky and Taqqu (1994, p. 87).
The ex-post version of the SLCAPM can also be written as an single-equation
error-correction form, in which an error-correction term takes account of the price
information, i.e. the long-run covariance risk.
rt
= sRt
+ ¯
b[p - lP]t-1
, (5)
where ¯
b is a loading coefficient for the so-called error-correction term of the long-
run equilibrium. This form is an extension of the conventional CAPM, which is
consistent with any arbitrary relation between the two prices in the framework of
a univariate Beta model. In contrast to the conventional CAPM, the SLCAPM
is consistent with a certain relation between the two prices, namely a long-run
equilibrium relationship when it exists. According to the SLCAPM, the risk of an
investment is measured by both the usual (short-run) market Beta and the long-run
market Beta, and the relations between expected return and the two market Betas
are linear.
The theoretical background for the stable CAPM was originated by Samuelson
(1967), who shows the existence of mean-variance (variation) efficiency under the
non-existence of second moment. This means that the Markowitz portfolio theory
still works under Assumption 1, namely -stable distributed returns. This provides
the SLCAPM with an economic foundation which is still based on the Markowitz
theory, namely the rule of expected returns and variance (variation) of returns. Sim-
ilarly to the CCAPM of Jagannathan and Wang (1996), the SLCAPM is, therefore,
a generalized form of the probability principle of mean-variance efficiency. This
is a decidedly different aspect of the SLCAPM from some mostly used modified
CAPMs, such as BMCAPM of French and Fama (1992, 1996), whose modification
is performed by including firm-specific variables.
3.2 Econometric Estimation and Test of the SLCAPM
The econometric models for estimating the two unknown market Betas in (3) are
given as follows:
rt
= sRt
+ us
t
, (6)
pt
= lPt
+ ul
t
, (7)
where, in the framework of regression analysis, both Rt
(Pt
) and us
t
(ul
t
) are typically
assumed to be independently -stably distributed.
10
For the estimation of the short- and long-run market Beta in (6) and (7), we
apply the best unbiased (BU) estimator of Blattberg and Sargent (1971). The BU-
estimators for s and l in (6) and (7) are given as
BU
^
s =

T
t=1
|Pt
|/(-1)
,
respectively, for   (1, 2], which is equivalent to ordinary least squares (OLS),
when  = 2. The asymptotic distribution of the BU-estimator is again a function
of -stable random variables. See, for more details on the asymptotic analysis of
the BU-estimator, Kim and Rachev (1998). For the empirical application of the
BU-estimator, the tail-thickness parameter  must be known. When  is unknown,
some estimates of  are usually substituted for the true .
Alternatively, equation 7 can be estimated by the so-called fully-modified (FM)
OLS method introduced by Phillips (1991).

] and w(·) is a weight function, which yields positive semi-
definite estimates, where l is a lag-truncation parameter. The FM-estimator is
designed originally for normally distributed (co-)integrated variables, but the semi-
parametric correction of endogeneity of the exogeneous variable,12 and serial corre-
lation in the residuals still works for errors with infinite­variance.
Testing the null hypothesis of the conventional CAPM against the alternative of
the SLCAPM is of interest, namely:
H0
: CAPM vs H1
: SLCAPM.
12Actually, the assumption of independence between Rt(Pt) and us
t
(ul
t
) barely holds in the
ex-post version of CAPM because of the construction of a benchmark portfolio. Note that, by
its construction, a benchmark portfolio contains the residual process, including the endogenous
variable, in the framework of the univariate Beta model.
11
Equivalently, an appealing test of whether the data are consistent with the SLCAPM
can be performed simply by the usual t-test (called tECM
in Kremers, Ericsson and
Dolado, 1992) on the loading coefficient in (5) as:
H0
: ¯
b = 0 vs H1
: ¯
b < 0.
Kim (2000) provides finite-sample distributions for the t-statistic.
4 An empirical application
For our empirical work, we use the daily DAX and its 30 assets from the Karls-
ruher Kapitalmarktdatenbank for the period June 19, 1998 to June 18, 1999 (252
observations), where the composition of the DAX was not changed.
A pre-test needed for estimating a SLCAPM is the checking symmetry (Assump-
tion 2) of each pair in the bivariate SLCAPM, which ensures the linearity of the
regressions in (6) and (7). This can be done by the test of bivariate symmetry of
Heathecote, Rachev and Cheng (1995), as implemented in Kim (1999).13 The re-
sults of the test of bivariate symmetry are reported in Table 3. The null hypothesis
13The test procedure is based on the tail estimators of the spectral measure. It is assumed that
Xt = [X1t
, X2t], t = 1, . . . , n, are two-dimensional, mutually independent -stable random vectors
(0 <  < 2).
i. For every pair of the observation [x1t
, x2t] of Xt, a corresponding polar coordinate t :=
x2
1t
+ x2
2t
and an inverse tangent ~
t := arctan(x1t
/x2t) are calculated.
ii. Let k be a sequence of integers satisfying 1  k  n/2. Derive the estimator for the
normalized spectral measure, n(), by
n() =
1
k
n
t=1
I{t
, t
n-k+1:n
}
,   (0, 2],
where I{} is the usual indicator function and i:n denotes the i-th order statistic. Above,
parameter t is defined as
t =

In practice, one may take grid (1, · · · , d), 1 = 2/d, d = 2, where d is the number of
grid points and 2/d the step width.
iii. Under some regularity conditions, one can use the sample supremum of () in region
0 <   , namely
n := sup

|n() - n( + ) + n()|

as the test statistic.

of bivariate symmetry cannot be rejected at 5% significance level for any pair of the
returns. The result shows that evidence of bivariate symmetry is strong enough for
the univariate Beta, which is assumed to be a linear relation between the returns of
individual assets and the benchmark portfolio in the SLCAPM.
The estimates of the short- and long-run Betas are reported in Table 4. The first
column of Table 4 shows the average returns and the second the Beta-coefficient in
the conventional CAPM in (2), while the third and the fourth show the estimated
short- and long-run market Beta for the SLCAPM in (4). The differences between
the two estimates of the Beta in the conventional CAPM and of the short-run Beta
in the SLCAPM are moderate for most regressions. The long-run Beta-coefficient
show how large the normalized covariance between an asset price and the price of
the market portfolio may be. The high positive l (greater than one) means an over-
proportional development of the price level of an asset in comparison with the market
price. The low l means that the price of an asset develops under-proportionally in
comparison with the market price, or partly in an opposite direction to the market
price in the long run. If one takes information on the Beta-coefficient from the
conventional CAPM (in the second column of Table 4), Bayer (0.71) has almost the
same Beta as Preussag (0.72). But Bayer has lost in this period from 3.83 to 3.70,
like the DAX, while Preussag has gained from 3.53 to 3.93 in the same period. Bayer
has a large long-run Beta (1.17), but Preussag a small one (0.62). What is discussed
above is summarized in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows three asset prices, compared with
the DAX, of which the first one (SAP) has a high l (1.55), the second one (Hoechst)
a moderate l (0.97), and the last one (Preussag) has a low l (0.62).14 In the period
considered, the DAX lost from 8.65 to 8.60 points (i.e. ¯
Ri
= -0.05). The SAP which
shows the highest positive correlation with the DAX in the long run, namely 1.55,
lost over-proportionally from 6.43 to 5.99 (¯
ri
= -0.44). This is also the case for the
Degussa. The Hoechst, which has a long-run Beta of about one (0.97) lost almost
proportionally to the DAX from 3.78 to 3.77 (¯
ri
= -0.01). The Preussag, however,
whose stable long-run Beta is small (0.62), gained from 3.53 to 3.93 (¯
ri
= 0.40).
This is also the case for the Deutsche Telekom.
Decisions on an investment based on the SLCAPM look similar to those based
on the conventional CAPM. One advantage is that one can use --besides the usual
market Beta-- stable long-run information additionally. To sum up, the decision
rule based on the SLCAPM can be summarized as follow: for a short-run investment,
the conventional rule is still valid, namely, when s = 1.0, the return tends to mirror
From the functional limit theorem for n, one can easily verify that ^
n follows asymptotically
a standard normal distribution. Assuming sufficiently large values of n and k, we reject the
null hypothesis of bivariate symmetry at significance level , when n
> z/2, where z/2 is the
100(1 - /2) percentile of the standard normal distribution.
14For a better comparison, a level-shift for the illustration is performed.
13
the return on the market; when s > (<)1.0, the return tends to be greater (smaller)
than the return on the market. For a long-run investment, however, the long-run
risk factor plays an important role: when l > 1(< 1), the return tends to be
positive (negative) for the case of increasing market price, and vice versa. Actually,
one can obtain information on both the risk factors from the SLCAPM.
5 Empirical Performance
In this Section, using the cross-sectional regression of Fama and MacBeth (1973),
we perform a test to check the empirical performance of the SLCAPM. For doing
this, we use the same data used in Jagannathan and Wang (1996), i.e., the stock
data of nonfinancial firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and
the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) covered by the Center for Research in Se-
curity Prices (CRSP) alone. Jagannathan and Wang (1996) create 100 portfolios
of NYSE and AMEX stocks, as in Fama and French (1992), which we also use.15
This is a time series of monthly returns for the period July 1963 to December 1990
(330 observations). Using the same data ensures a powerful comparison among the
models.
In the last few decades, many works have reported the lack of empirical support
for the conventional CAPM and, at the same time, many modifications have been
studied to improve the empirical performance of the CAPM. Fama and French (1992)
empirically tested the following regression model, considered in Fama and MacBeth
(1973)
E[ri
] = 0
+ 1
i
, (8)
where E[ri
] is the expected return on the asset i, i
the corresponding market Beta
and 0
and 1
denote the expected return on a zero-beta and the market-risk pre-
mium, respectively. In empirical tests E[ri
] is usually replaced by the mean value
of the observed returns. In a widely-cited paper of Fama and French (1992), the
poor relationship between market Beta and average return is reported. They show
that the 1
is insignificantly different from zero and the correlation coefficient, R2,
is very low (1.35%). That is to say, the relation between market Beta and average
return is flat, as Fama and French (1992) conclude. Jagannathan and Wang (1996)
extend the (unconditional) conventional CAPM to a conditional CAPM, relaxing
the assumption of constant Beta, and show, using the same data in Fama and French
(1992), that the R2 can be substantially improved to 29.32%.
15See Jagannathan and Wang (1996) for details on creating the data set. I thank Prof. Wang
for kindly sending the data to me. They can now be obtained via the Internet, http://www.gsb.
columbia.edu/faculty/zwang/exchange.
14
We now empirically test the SLCAPM as follows:
E[ri
] = 0
+ 1
s
i
+ 2
l
i
, (9)
where 2
is the long-run risk premium and s
i
and l
i
are the short- and long-run
Beta for i-th asset. The results of bivariate symmetry tests and the estimated
short- and long-run Betas are given in Tables 5 and 6, respectively, where, in the
first block of Table 6, the average returns are reported. For estimating the short-run
Betas, the BU-estimation and the long-run Betas, both the BU- and FM-estimations
are applied. Next, based on the cross-sectional regression, we test the empirical
performance of the SLCAPM. This can be done by regressing the estimated short-
and long-run market Betas on the average returns as estimates of the unobservable
expected returns given in the first block of Table 6. The cross-sectional regression
for the SLCAPM is then given as
¯
r = 0
+ 1
^
s + 2
^
l + ,
where ¯
r = [¯

s = [^

l = [^

, · · · , ^

].
For our case, N = 100 and T = 330.
Figure 4 illustrates a set of sequential correlation coefficients, i.e., the sample
size is reduced recursively from 330 (July 1963 ­ December 1990) to 131 (February
1980 ­ December 1990) and the corresponding correlation coefficient is obtained
sequentially for each time length. Figure 4 shows the following:
- The correlation coefficient of the SLCAPM for the full sample is 60.90 %,
whereas that of the conventional CAPM is 1.35 %, as reported in Jagannathan
and Wang (1996).
- The average correlation coefficient for the SLCAPM is 63.25 %, with a standard
deviation of 7.99 %, whereas that of the conventional CAPM is 17.04 % with a
standard deviation of 10.36 %. The highest (lowest) correlation coefficient for
the SLCAPM is 82.53 % (46.30 %), whereas that of the conventional CAPM
are 41.20 % (1.18 %).
- One comment on the empirical result in Fama and French (1992): the empirical
performance of the conventional CAPM is surely not persuasive, but it should
be noticed that the empirical result in Fama and French (1992) is the second
worst (lowest) correlation coefficient from the entire 200 sequential samples.
The result from the sequential correlation coefficient of the SLCAPM seems to be
promising for applying the SLCAPM to empirical work. Since the SLCAPM is
based on the economic foundation, like the Sharpe/Lintner-CAPM without any
firm specific variable, the result also means that the mean-variance efficiency is still
15
valid as an economic hypothesis, describing the behaviour of investors in financial
markets. Lastly, we compare the empirical performance of the SLCAPM with that
of the recently published two modified CAPMs. The first one is the BMCAPM by
Fama (1992, 1996), which contains two firm-specific variables, firm-size and book-
to-market equity. The other is the CCAPM by Jagannathan and Wang (1996).
Table 7 shows the comparison. The first row of Table 7 shows the result for the
conventional CAPM, as also given in Fama and French (1992) and Jagannathan and
Wang (1996). The coefficient for the (usual) market Beta is insignificant, and R2 is
very low (1.35%). That is to say, the conventional CAPM can be rejected for the
underlying data. The BMCAPM explains --with two firm-specific variables, firm-
size and book-to-market equity-- 55.12% of the cross-sectional variation in average
returns and the CCAPM, which captures nearly 30% without firm-specific variables
and 55.21% with one firm-specific variable, human labour. The SLCAPM improves
R2 slightly more than the two, namely to 60.90%, based on the BU-estimation, and
68.17%, based on the FM-estimation, and all three coefficients are significant for the
FM-estimates.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we examined a possible modification of the conventional CAPM. Two
restrictive assumptions of the conventional CAPM, under which the relation between
average return and Beta is very weak, namely normality of returns and single-period
static property, are generalized to the -stable Paretianity of returns and the long-
run (dynamic) setting. With an empirical application, we demonstrated that the
average returns are highly correlated with the long-run information that can be
captured by the SLCAPM. Furthermore, it turned out that the SLCAPM improves
the empirical performance of the CAPM, and still corresponds to the Markowitz
portfolio theory, mean-variance rule, and, hence, demonstrates that the CAPM is
alive and well.16
More recently, Lettau and Ludvigson (1999) empirically test a conditional version
of the consumption CAPM with consumption-wealth ratio as a conditioning variable
and find a substantial improvement in the performance of the CAPM.17 It would also
be interesting to consider for future research --in line with the work of Jagannathan
and Wang (1996)-- a conditional stable long-run CAPM, taking the time-varying
property of the market Beta into account.
16This is the title of an earlier version of the paper of Jagannathan and Wang (1996), as a
light-hearted answer to the title of a paper by Fama and French (1996), "The CAPM is wanted,
dead or alive".
17With a different data set, the conditional version of the consumption CAPM presents a high
R2 of 71%.
