Article
This article reports results of two studies on the quality of life
in the United States that extend a previous research program
on consciousness and social well-being into the area of col-
lective stress and stress-related indicators of public health,
namely, infant mortality rate (IMR) and drug-related fatality
rate (DFR). Previous research analyzed the impact of the
same intervention on homicide and violent crime (Dillbeck
& Cavanaugh, 2016) and motor vehicle fatalities and fatali-
ties due to other accidents (Cavanaugh & Dillbeck, 2017).
In a broader context, this article expands a substantive
body of research on the collective effects of changes in con-
sciousness and quality of life. In these studies, change in the
quality of societal consciousness is measured by group prac-
tice of the TM-Sidhi program, an advance practice of the
Transcendental Meditation technique.1 Previous studies have
found that when practiced by a sufficient number of people,
these subjective procedures are associated with an extended
influence on social behavior in society, a finding that has
implications for a broader understanding of consciousness.
We will first describe these procedures, then the theoreti-
cal implications for the nature of consciousness implied by
previous research on these procedures, and then discuss the
indicators chosen for the present studies.
The Transcendental Meditation technique is described by
its founder as a simple, experiential mental procedure of
"turning the attention inwards towards the subtler levels of a
thought until the mind . . . arrives at the source of the thought"
(Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1969, p. 470). "Source of thought"
indicates a state of "pure consciousness" gained when the
mind settles down to a mode of inner silence in which the
division of knower, knowing, and known is transcended and
awareness is open to itself alone (Roth, 2002).

Group Practice of the Transcendental
Meditation® and TM-Sidhi® Program
and Reductions in Infant Mortality and
Drug-Related Death: A
Quasi-Experimental Analysis
Michael C. Dillbeck1 and Kenneth L. Cavanaugh1
Abstract
These two studies tested the prediction that the group practice of a procedure for the development of consciousness, the
Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi program, by a sufficiently large group of individuals would be sufficient to reduce
collective stress in the larger population, reflected in two stress-related health indicators, infant mortality rate and drug-
related fatality rate. Based on theoretical prediction and prior research, from January 2007 through 2010 (intervention
period), this effect should have been measurable. Change in the rates of these two indicators during the intervention period
were estimated from 2002 through 2010 data using a broken-trend (or segmented trend) intervention model with time series
regression methods. Significant changes in trend for both the infant mortality rate and drug-related fatality rate were evident
at the predicted time and in the predicted direction, controlling for preintervention trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation.
The changes in trend were both statistically and practically significant, indicating an average annual decline of 3.12% in infant
mortality rate and 7.61% in drug-related fatality rate. Diagnostic tests are satisfactory and indicate that it is unlikely that the
statistical results are attributable to spurious regression. The mechanism for these collective effects is discussed in view of
possible alternative hypotheses.

Meta-analysis of research on individuals practicing
Transcendental Meditation has found that increased mental
silence during the practice, in comparison with sitting with
eyes closed, is associated physiologically with a unique state
of restful alertness (higher basal galvanic skin resistance,
lower breath rate, lower plasma lactate); this state of restful
alertness, or reduced physiological stress, is also evident in
participants outside the practice period (lower respiration
rate, lower heart rate, lower plasma lactate, and fewer sponta-
neous skin resistance responses; Dillbeck & Orme-Johnson,
1987). Alertness is indicated by increased electroencephalo-
gram (EEG) coherence during Transcendental Meditation
practice; increased integration of brain functioning is also
found longitudinally (Dillbeck & Bronson, 1981; Travis
et al., 2010; Travis et al., 2009). Additional research, includ-
ing reduced cortisol during the practice and more effective
cortisol response to stress, indicates that the physiological
changes during the practice are counter to those found during
stress and support recovery from stress (Jevning, Wilson, &
Davidson, 1978; MacLean et al., 1997; Walton et al., 2004).
There is a large body of research on the stress-reducing
effects of this procedure for health, particularly cardiovascu-
lar health (e.g., reviewed by Schneider & Carr, 2014), and on
psychological variables, which can be considered in the con-
text of theories of human development (e.g.,Alexander et al.,
1990; Dillbeck & Alexander, 1989).
In the 1960s, based on the understanding of conscious-
ness contained in the Vedic tradition of India, Maharishi pre-
dicted that even a small proportion of the society experiencing
this state of pure consciousness would be sufficient to enliven
greater order and positivity in the collective consciousness of
society, reflected in decreased stress, resulting in decreased
negative behavioral trends such as crime and violence
(Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1977).
In 1976, Maharishi introduced the advanced TM-Sidhi
program, the purpose of which is described as accelerating
the integration of the inner silence experienced during
Transcendental Meditation with daily activity outside of
meditation (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986). In discussions
with physical scientists in the light of the ancient Vedic
knowledge, he formalized the prediction that when a group
practices the TM-Sidhi program together, only the square
root of 1% (1%) of the population--as compared with 1%
practicing Transcendental Meditation individually--would
be required to create a calming and orderly influence in soci-
ety (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986). The square root term is
by analogy to coherent phenomena in physical systems in
which the combined intensity of coherent elements can be
proportional to their square (Hagelin, 1987). On that basis, it
should be possible to influence very large populations: for
example, the 1% of a city of 9 million is 300 individuals,
and is near 1,800 for the current U.S. population.
The relatively small number of required TM-Sidhi pro-
gram group participants permits quasi-experiments using a
time scale of analysis finer than that of annual data.
A number of published studies have used time series (TS)
intervention analysis or transfer function (TF) analysis (Box
& Jenkins, 1976) to evaluate effects at the city, state, or
national/regional levels on indicators that reflect reduction of
social stress, such as decreased crime and violence, or
improvement in comprehensive quality of life indices.
For example, Dillbeck, Cavanaugh, Glenn, Orme-
Johnson, and Mittlefehldt (1987) found that when the size of
a group of TM-Sidhi program experts who had assembled on
courses exceeded the 1% of the populations of each course
location (Delhi, India; Metro Manila, Philippines; Puerto
Rico), TS intervention analysis showed reduced crime2 inde-
pendent of alternative explanations. Using TS intervention
methods, similar results were found on monthly crime rates
in Merseyside, United Kingdom (Hatchard, Deans,
Cavanaugh, & Orme-Johnson, 1996). Two studies in
Washington, D.C., using TF methodology found predicted
variations between the size of a TM-Sidhi group in the city
and decreased violent crime rate when the size of the group
was over the predicted threshold (Dillbeck, Banus, Polanzi,
& Landrith, 1988; Hagelin et al., 1999). The second study
(Hagelin et al., 1999) was a prospective study with predic-
tions registered in advance. Both studies in Washington,
D.C., found no evidence for alternative hypotheses.
At both state and national levels, improvement was found
using TS intervention analysis on a comprehensive index of
quality of life integrating multiple monthly behavioral and
health-related variables (e.g., homicide or crime, motor vehi-
cle fatalities, cigarette consumption) during months when the
size of TM-Sidhi group was larger than the required 1% in
Rhode Island (Dillbeck et al., 1987) or in the United States or
the United States plus Canada (Dillbeck & Rainforth, 1996).
Similarly, reductions in an index of national violent fatalities
(homicide, suicide, and motor vehicle fatalities) were found
using TS intervention analysis over a multiple-year period
during weeks when the size of a stable, large TM-Sidhi group
was sufficient to predict an effect for either the United States
or Canada (Assimakis & Dillbeck, 1995; Dillbeck, 1990).
A study in Israel, spanning multiple societal levels and
addressing multiple outcome parameters for each, found that
over a 2-month period, daily quality of life indices for
Jerusalem, Israel as a whole, and the Israel­Lebanon conflict
(ongoing at that time) significantly improved during days
when the size of a temporary group was sufficiently large to
yield theoretically predicted effects at the city, national, or
regional levels (Orme-Johnson,Alexander, Davies, Chandler,
& Larimore, 1988). Comparable results were found using TS
intervention analysis and TF analysis. A number of alterna-
tive explanations and alternative analysis models were effec-
tively considered both in the original article and in subsequent
responses to methodological questions (Orme-Johnson,
Alexander, & Davies, 1990; Orme-Johnson & Oates, 2009).
In a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of vio-
lence due to the Lebanese conflict, Davies and Alexander
(2005) looked at all seven intervention periods during a
Dillbeck and Cavanaugh 3
2.25-year period (1983-1985) when there were TM-Sidhi
program groups of sufficient size (on temporary courses) to
predict an impact upon the conflict in Lebanon either from
within Lebanon, near to Lebanon, or even at some distance.
Using daily event data from nine news sources that were
blind coded by an independent Lebanese coder using scales
derived independently for research on the conflict, TS inter-
vention analysis indicated a significant impact of each of the
seven temporary groups on reduced conflict. The analysis
controlled for temperature, holidays, and weekends, and the
findings were independent of alternative TS noise models.
Multiple indicators of reduced conflict also replicated this
effect when combining intervention periods.
In these studies, there is an implied underlying connection
between individuals that would permit such far-reaching
effects of stress reduction beyond that which could be
explained by behavioral interactions. That is, as described by
the Vedic tradition of India (Radhakrishnan, 1953), pure con-
sciousness is proposed to have a field-like character, as
opposed to the isolated quality of individual consciousness.
On that basis, it is predicted that a calming or stress-reducing
influence will be experienced in the broader collective con-
sciousness of society (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986).
In extending these studies into the health area, we assume
that collective stress (or its reduction) can have an impact
upon some stress-related health outcomes, not only upon
behavioral violence such as crime. Analyzing U.S. annual
data using a state stress index that combined economic, fam-
ily, and community stressors (Linsky, Bachman, & Straus,
1995; Linsky & Straus, 1986), the degree of social stress pre-
dicted violent crime rate and also maladaptive behaviors
(Linsky & Straus, 1986). However, social stress so defined
was less associated with mortality due to illness, illnesses
whose morbidity at the individual level are exacerbated by
stress. One of the possible reasons for this is the unknown
and variable time lag between serious morbidity and mortal-
ity, not to mention between serious stress and morbidity
(Linsky & Straus, 1986).
The health indicators selected for this study are those for
which mortality is directly influenced by stress, rather than
those indicative of disease states that develop over time and
whose time course may be inconsistent and hard to specify.
Specifically, infant mortality (IM) and deaths due to drugs
(DD) were selected for investigation. The following is a
rationale for each outcome variable.
IM is both a fundamental indicator of national health as
well as a stress-related phenomenon in the United States.
Compared with other developed countries, IM rates are high,
with the United States ranking 26th among Organisation for
Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) coun-
tries (MacDorman, Mathews, Mohangoo, & Zeitlin, 2014).
Preterm birth is one of the major causes of IM; in 2005,
36.5% of U.S. infant deaths were due to preterm-related
causes, and 68.6% of all infant deaths occurred to preterm
infants (MacDorman & Mathews, 2008). IM affects African
American mothers much more severely than White mothers
or mothers of other racial/ethnic groups, and preterm birth is
substantially higher among African American mothers
(MacDorman & Mathews, 2011; Mathews, MacDorman, &
Thoma, 2015). Preterm birth risk has been shown to be
related to perceived stress, pregnancy-related anxiety, and
perception of racial discrimination (Dole et al., 2003). The
causes of IM are multiple; nevertheless, stress is one major
influence, as described above. The cascade of physiological/
hormonal events in the mother's body initiated by stress and
their interaction with the physiology of labor initiation are
described in detail by Gennaro and Hennessy (2003) and by
Latendresse (2009).
DD of all types also reflect to a great degree the immedi-
ate effects of stress and are affected by the degree of con-
scious alertness or vigilance. The category of DD fatalities
includes all deaths for which drugs are the essential cause,
irrespective of whether the drug was illicit or prescription,
including acute poisoning and also medical conditions aris-
ing from chronic use. DD have increased substantially since
1990, a period in which prescriptions for opioid analgesics
for pain management rose dramatically. Between 1999 and
2002, deaths due to opioid analgesic poisonings rose over
90%, becoming a larger source of drug poisoning deaths than
those due to heroin or cocaine (Paulozzi, Budnitz, & Xi,
2006). An investigation in 2010 found that of all drug over-
dose deaths, 57.7% involved pharmaceuticals, and of those,
75.2% involved opioids (either alone or in combination with
other drugs; Jones, Mack, & Paulozzi, 2013).
Opioid analgesics have been increasingly prescribed as
part of more aggressive pain management regimens.
Chemically, the opioids influence the body in a similar way
as opium-derived opiates such as morphine and heroin
(Volkow, 2014). For this reason, vigilance must be main-
tained to avoid addiction to opioid analgesics. Chronic stress
has been found to increase the vulnerability to addiction
(Sinha, 2008).
By 2010, among those 35 to 54 years of age, poisoning
had become the most common type of accidental death, more
common than auto-related deaths (Harmon, 2010). Recent
research has found that the death rate for White non-Hispan-
ics aged 45 to 54 years actually rose from 1999 to 2013, par-
ticularly among the least educated, reversing a trend of
previous decades (Case & Deaton, 2015). The authors
hypothesize that this increase in mortality could be driven by
factors including deaths due to the increased availability of
opioid prescriptions and, in some cases where addiction had
occurred, transition to heroin when opioid restriction
increased. They note that financial stress and insecurity may
have contributed to these results, including wage stagnation
and diminished retirement prospects. Morbidity also
increased in this group as indicated by self-reported level of
physiological and mental health as well as increased preva-
lence of chronic pain. Increased DD and alcohol poisoning
(as well as several other factors) also increased in other
4 SAGE Open
5-year age groups (30-34, 60-64) although not enough to
raise the overall mortality rate.
It is clear that the rapid rise of DD in the past two decades
is a serious health concern in the American population as a
whole. At the same time, it seems likely that this variable is
directly affected by perceived life stress and, in the case of
opioid medication, is influenced by vigilance and self-aware-
ness to avoid addiction. It is in this context that change in DD
is a potential reactive indicator of changes in the quality of
collective consciousness.
The two studies reported here evaluate the effects on U.S.
DD and IM associated with the rapid creation of a large
Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi group sufficient in
size to create a hypothesized influence of reduced stress and
increased alertness in the collective consciousness of the
United States. The rapid establishment of this group, approxi-
mating in size a step function that could be appropriately mod-
eled by a binary variable, offered a straightforward opportunity
for quasi-experimental intervention research (Cavanaugh &
Dillbeck, 2017; Dillbeck & Cavanaugh, 2016).
The hypothesis of the current research, consistent with
previous studies, is that there would be a significant impact
of the independent variable measured in terms of decreased
rates of IM and drug-related deaths.
General Method
Intervention
To assess the predicted effect on these two fatality rates of the
largest group of TM-Sidhi participants in North America, the
analysis used a binary intervention variable based on the size
of this group. The location of the group was in Fairfield, Iowa,
at Maharishi University of Management, where students, fac-
ulty, staff, and community members assemble each day to
practice the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi pro-
gram together before and after school or work. The meditation
halls on campus record the morning and evening daily totals.
To expand the size of the TM-Sidhi program group from
under 1,000 to a number sufficient to create a predicted posi-
tive influence for the whole United States (approximately
1,725 needed for the 297 million population at that time,
according to the 1% formula), a special course was held at
the University beginning in July 2006 for visitors from the
United States or around the world.3 To further increase the
number of participants, starting in November 2006, a large
group of several hundred visiting Indian experts in the
TM-Sidhi program were hosted nearby in their own facili-
ties.4 After that, the total number of TM-Sidhi participants
began to exceed the predicted threshold in January 2007 and
remained above or near that level throughout the interven-
tion period of the study, 2007 through 2010. An intervention
period of that length was adopted because when the first data
collection began to evaluate this intervention, 2010 was the
most recent data available for homicide and violent crime
(Dillbeck & Cavanaugh, 2016), and this period was subse-
quently extended to other variables for the sake of compari-
son (Cavanaugh & Dillbeck, 2017). The binary intervention
variable (I
t
) was specified as 0 from July 2001 to December
2006, and 1 from January 2007 to December 2010. (Archival
data of the group size was not available continuously prior to
July 2001.)
Dependent Variables
The dependent variable data for both studies were obtained
from the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For Study 1, the
dependent variable is the monthly U.S. IMR within 1 week of
birth per 10,000 live births. The IM monthly total was
obtained from the data set "Underlying Causes of Death,
1999-2013" through the CDC WONDER Online Database
(CDC, National Center for Health Statistics, 2015a). The
number of live births each month was available also from
CDC WONDER or the National Center for Health Statistics
VitalStats system as natality public-use data in different
source files depending upon the years, 1995 to 2002, 2003 to
2006, and 2006 to 2013, posted in November 2005, March
2009, and January 2015, respectively (CDC, National Center
for Health Statistics, 2015b).
For Study 2, the dependent variable is the drug-related
fatality rate (DFR) per 1 million population. As noted above,
this category of mortality includes any type of drug and any
circumstance of death, as long as drugs are cited on the death
record as the essential cause of death. Data were obtained
from the National Center for Health Statistics through the
CDC WONDER Online Database5 (CDC, National Center
for Health Statistics, 2012). The computation of the rate per
1 million population used U.S. Census counts for April 2000
and April 2010, with monthly linear interpolation and exten-
sion to December 2010.
Data Analysis
To analyze the results of the quasi-experiment, we use inter-
vention analysis, or interrupted TS analysis, of data for 2002
to 2010 (Chelimsky, Shadish, & Orwin, 1997; Cook &
Campbell, 1979; Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002) to test
the hypothesis that a significant reduction in trend for IMR
and DFR occurred beginning with the onset of the interven-
tion period in January 2007. TS regression analysis is used to
estimate a broken-trend intervention model (Perron, 1989;
Rappoport & Reichlin, 1989) to test for the hypothesized
trend shifts in IMR and DFR. The intervention model in each
case includes a preintervention linear trend with an exoge-
nous structural break in the trend function at the theoretically
predicted date of December 2006. The intervention compo-
nent is modeled as a binary (0-1) step function that triggers a
shift in the linear trend function with the onset of the inter-
vention period.

Study 1: Results of Analysis of Monthly
IMR
Plot of Monthly IMR
Panel (a) of Figure 1 displays the plot of IMR and the IMR
forecast (dotted line) for 2007 to 2010 based on IMR's
preintervention TS behavior (see Note 8). The sample is
August 2002 through December 2010, with effective sample
size N = 101. This sample was chosen to give the largest pos-
sible effective sample (equivalent for intervention and sta-
tionarity tests) after allowing for both first differencing and
for 12 lags of first-differenced dependent variables required
Figure 1. Plots of monthly IMR and size of the TM-Sidhi group (GROUP).
Note. In Panel (a), the plot of IMR for August 2002 to December 2010 displays irregular variation plus weak monthly seasonal variation around a flat or
slightly declining preintervention trend that shifts to a more steeply declining trend in the intervention period starting in January 2007 (see vertical line in
the plot). During the intervention period, actual IMR declines more rapidly than predicted by its prior trend. In Panel (b), the plot of the monthly average
daily size of the TM-Sidhi group rises rapidly starting in July 2006 until in January 2007, it exceeds the predicted critical threshold of 1,725, the 1% of
the U.S. population at that time. The average size of GROUP is 591 participants for the 53 preintervention months and 1,792 for the 48 months of the
intervention. Panel (b) adapted from "The Contribution of Proposed Field Effects of Consciousness to the Prevention of US Accidental Fatalities: Theory

for diagnostic testing of the statistical assumption of
stationarity.
In the preintervention period, the IMR trend is relatively
flat or very slightly negative with irregular variation and
weak seasonal variation around the trend. Beginning in
January 2007 (see vertical line in the plot), IMR displays a
shift to a more rapidly declining trend that continues through
the end of the sample period. During the intervention period,
actual IMR declines more rapidly than predicted by its prior
trend and faster than the IMR forecast.
Panel (b) of Figure 1 shows the plot of the GROUP series.
As noted above, the GROUP plot approximates a step func-
tion, with an average of 591 participants for the 53-month
baseline period compared with 1,792 for the 48-month inter-
vention. In January 2007, the GROUP size for the first time
in the sample period rose above the theoretically predicted
critical threshold of 1,725, the 1% of the U.S. population.
Regression Results for IMR
To test the hypothesis of a decrease in the trend slope for
IMR, we estimate the following broken-trend intervention
model that incorporates a shift of linear trend beginning with
the onset of the intervention (January 2007):
IMRt t jt j t
j
t DT S D
= + + - + +

   
0 1 2 1
( ) .
 (1)
In Equation 1, 
0
is the regression intercept, t is a linear time
trend (t = 1, 2, 3, . . ., N), and 
1
is the preintervention trend
slope for IMR. The variable DT
t
models the shift in trend due
to the intervention with DT
t
= (t - t
B
)I
t
, where t
B
is the time
of the hypothesized break in the linear trend function
(December 2006) and I
t
is a binary (0-1) indicator variable
(step function) that takes the value zero for the preinterven-
tion period and 1.0 for the intervention period (t > t
B
). The
regression coefficient (
2
- 
1
) for DT
t
gives the change in
trend slope for IMR from the preintervention value (
1
) to the
slope in the intervention period (
2
). The hypothesis of a
negative shift in trend for IMR during the intervention
implies (
2
- 
1
) < 0.
The summation term in Equation 1 is a deterministic sea-
sonal component to control for the monthly seasonal varia-
tion in IMR. The seasonal component consists of 11 binary
(0-1) seasonal dummy variables D
j
(with monthly index j =
1, 2, . . ., 11 where January is denoted by j = 1; Granger &
Newbold, 1986). The seasonal regression coefficient for
each month is given by S
jt
. Finally, 
t
is an independent and
identically distributed, serially uncorrelated normal error
with mean zero and variance 2.
Table 1 reports the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
results for Equation 1. The estimated preintervention trend for
IMR is small but negative and significant. The shift in trend has
negative sign, as hypothesized, and is highly significant, t(87)
= -4.50, p = 2.1 × 10-5, effect size f = -0.482, a medium to
large effect, indicating an acceleration of the preintervention
declining trend during the intervention period 2007 to 2010.
The absolute value of the effect size measure is the square root
of Cohen's f2 for a regression variable (or set of variables),
with 0.59, 0.39, and 0.14 considered large, medium, and small
effects, respectively (Cohen, 1988).6 Panel (a) of Figure 2
graphically compares the preintervention trend slope for IMR
with that for 2007 to 2010 and Panel (b) displays the estimated
trend shift parameter (-0.02292) with 95% confidence interval
= [-0.0128, -0.0330]. Although we have a clear a priori direc-
tional hypothesis for the shift in trend, to be conservative, two-
tailed tests are reported for the estimated trend shift (and all
other parameters). For reasons discussed below, the results
reported in Table 1 are based on t ratios that remain valid in the
presence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of the
regression residuals (Newey & West, 1987). The trend shift
remains highly significant using conventional OLS standard
errors, t(87) = -3.32, p = .001, but the preintervention trend is
not significantly different from zero, t(87) = -1.88, p = .064.
Relative to the preintervention trend, the estimated trend
shift implies a total reduction of 1.100 in IMR during the
2007 through 2010 intervention period.7 This is a reduction
of 12.47% (or 3.12% per year) compared with the mean pre-
intervention monthly rate of 8.821 fatalities per 10,000 live
births. The decline in IMR translates to a total of 992 averted
infant deaths for 2007 to 2010, deaths projected to occur had
the preintervention trend continued unchanged through 2007
to 2010.8 Thus, the estimated shift in trend for IMR during
2007 through 2010 has the predicted negative sign and is
both statistically and practically significant. Statistical analy-
sis (see Table 1) indicates that these results cannot be
explained by seasonal variation, autocorrelation, or preexist-
ing trends in IMR.
Regression Diagnostics for Analysis of IMR
Table 1 reports diagnostic tests for evaluating the adequacy
of the estimated intervention model. The null hypothesis of
serially uncorrelated (white noise) regression residuals at
lags 1 to 6, and 1 to 12 is rejected by the Breusch­Godfrey
Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test (Godfrey, 1978).9 Only one
autocorrelation at lags 1 to 36 is statistically significant. The
largest individual autocorrelations are at lag 1 (-0.208),
which is just significant at the 5% level, and lags 4 (-0.196)
and 16 (-0.224), which are nearly significant. Because of
this modest serial correlation, Table 1 reports t ratios based
on SEs that are valid (consistent) in the presence of serial
correlation and heteroscedasticity of possibly unknown form
(Newey & West, 1987).10
Although some mild autocorrelation is present, the autocor-
relations are all small, and thus the residual series appears to be
clearly stationary. A TS is said to be covariance stationary (or
weakly stationary) if its mean, variance, and autocorrelations
(or, equivalently, its autocovariances) are invariant with respect
to a change in time origin (Enders, 2010). Empirical support for
stationarity of the IMR residual series is provided by a

frequency domain test based on the periodogram of regression
residuals (Baum & Wiggins, 2000; Robinson, 1995). The
Robinson test evaluates stationarity based on an empirical esti-
mate of the order of integration of a TS, I(d), where d is the
number of times the series must be differenced to induce sta-
tionarity. For example, in the case of a nonstationary random
walk, the differencing parameter d = 1, and the series may be
transformed to I(0), or stationarity, by first differencing. The
Robinson test rejects the null hypothesis (p < .001) that the IMR
residual series is nonstationary (see Table 1),11 supporting the
conclusion that IMR is broken-trend stationary, exhibiting sta-
tionary fluctuations around a broken trend.
Stationarity of the regression residuals is required for
valid statistical inferences regarding the estimated regression
parameters in the intervention model (Banerjee, Dolado,
Galbraith, & Hendry, 1993; Enders, 2010; Granger &
Newbold, 1986). Broken-trend stationarity for IMR implies
that the OLS regression estimates in Table 1 have standard
distributions and thus the observed significant change in
trend is unlikely to be the result of "spurious regression"
(Banerjee et al., 1993; Granger & Newbold, 1986). Spurious
regressions can result when time trends are fitted to nonsta-
tionary variables that contain a random walk component
("stochastic trend"). A key signature of spurious regressions
is highly autocorrelated, nonstationary regression residuals.
The latter violate the distributional assumptions underlying
statistical inference for TS regression.
Table 1 reports a formal test for broken-trend stationarity
of a TS with a known (exogenous) structural break (Perron,
1989, 2006).12 The Perron unit root test rejects the null
hypothesis (p < .01) that the IMR TS is a nonstationary ran-
dom walk with drift (Perron, 1989; Zivot & Andrews,
1992).13 The alternative hypothesis is that IMR is broken-
trend stationary, displaying stationary fluctuations around a
linear trend with a known, one-time break in the trend func-
tion in December 2006.14
The results of all other diagnostic tests for model ade-
quacy are satisfactory. The null hypothesis of no autoregres-
sive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) for the regression
residuals is not rejected by the LM test for ARCH (Engle,
1982). Likewise, White's general test for heteroscedasticity
(White, 1980) fails to reject the null hypothesis that the
regression errors are homoscedastic or, if heteroscedasticity
is present, it is unrelated to the regressors. The null hypoth-
esis that the functional form of the regression model is cor-
rectlyspecifiedisnotrejectedbyRamsey's(1969)Regression
Error Specification Test (RESET). The omnibus Doornik­
Hansen test for normality of the regression errors (Doornik
& Hansen, 2008) fails to reject the null hypothesis that the
errors are drawn from a normal distribution. No regression
residuals exceed 3.5 standard errors, indicating the absence
of extreme outliers. Thus, the diagnostic tests for model ade-
quacy support statistical conclusion validity for the statistical
inferences reported in Table 1.
Study 2: Results of Analysis of DFR
Plot of DFR
The plot of DFR in Figure 3 displays monthly seasonal fluc-
tuations and a rising preintervention trend followed by a
flattening of the trend slope in 2007 through 2010. During
2007 through 2010, the forecast of DFR (dotted line) based
on preintervention data continues DFR's preintervention
upward trend, rising substantially above observed DFR (see
Note 18).
Regression Results for DFR

to test the hypothesis of a shift to a reduced trend slope for
DFR during the intervention period:

where lag 1 of DFR

is included (with regression coefficient

) to model its first-order autoregressive dynamics. All
other terms are defined as in Equation 1.
The OLS regression estimates of the model coefficients
for Equation 2 are reported in Table 2. The DFR preinterven-
tion trend is positive and significant. The change in trend has
negative sign and is highly significant, consistent with theo-
retical prediction.
In Table 2, the regression estimate of

in trend, gives the initial intervention impact. The significant
first-order autoregressive dynamics of DFR around the trend
implies a gradual adjustment of the preintervention trend to
its equilibrium, or long-run, value after onset of the interven-
tion. If (1 -

indicating that the estimated model is dynamically stable and
thus that the trend will converge to its equilibrium value  in
the long run (Banerjee, Dolado, & Mestre, 1998; Doornik &
Hendry, 2013; Enders, 2010). For the DFR analysis  =
-0.0578, t(86) = -7.12, p = 3.1 × 10-10, effect size f = -0.449,
a medium to large effect, and 95% confidence interval =
[-0.0417, -0.0739], where  is the coefficient on DT
t
in the
long-run equation for DFR (Hendry, 1995).15 In this context,
"long run" denotes the mathematically expected equilibrium
value and does not necessarily imply a long period of time
(Hendry, 1995). The estimated cumulative lag weights for
Equation 2 indicate that 50.2%, 75.25%, 87.6%, and 93.8%
of the adjustment in trend after the onset of the intervention
is completed within 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. Panel
(a) of Figure 4 compares the equilibrium trend slopes for the
preintervention and 2007 through 2010 periods and Panel (b)
shows the estimated trend shift with 95% confidence
interval.16
Dillbeck and Cavanaugh 9
Relative to the preintervention trend, the equilibrium
trend shift for 2007 to 2010 implies a total cumulative decline
in DFR of 2.7723 monthly fatalities per million population
during the intervention period.17 This is a reduction of
30.42% (or 7.61% annually) compared with the mean prein-
tervention monthly rate of 9.112 fatalities per million people.
The decline in DFR translates to a projected total of 26,425
averted drug-related fatalities for 2007 to 2010.18 Thus, the
estimated shift in trend for DFR is negative, as predicted, and
both practically and statistically significant. The statistical
findings reported in Table 2 suggest that these results cannot
be explained by autocorrelation, seasonal variation, or preex-
isting trends in DFR.
Regression Diagnostics for DFR
All diagnostic tests reported in Table 2 for adequacy of the
estimated intervention model are satisfactory. That no regres-
sion residuals exceed 3.5 standard errors indicates the
absence of extreme outliers. The LM tests for autocorrelation
of residuals at lags 1 to 6 and lags 1 to 12 are not significant,
and no autocorrelations at lags 1 to 36 are individually sig-
nificant, indicating that the regression residuals appear to be
serially uncorrelated, stationary white noise. The frequency
domain test (Baum & Wiggins, 2000; Robinson, 1995)
rejects the null hypothesis (p < .001) that the residual series
is nonstationary (see Table 2).19 The latter test, plus the
absence of significant residual autocorrelation, lend further
support to the conclusion of the Perron test (see Table 2) that
DFR is likely broken-trend stationary.20 Thus, the diagnostic
tests for adequacy of the broken-trend regression model sup-
port statistical conclusion validity for the statistical infer-
ences reported in Table 2.
Discussion
The results of the two studies indicate that, as hypothesized,
there was a significant and substantial reduction of the trends
of IMR and DFR during the intervention period 2007 through
2010, beginning in January 2007 with the onset of the inter-
vention. The null hypothesis of no effect of the intervention
on mortality trends was strongly rejected for both mortality
rate series. Diagnostic tests for the broken-trend intervention
analysis indicate the appropriateness of the statistical
assumptions underlying the analyses. These results are thus
consistent with the conclusion that the intervention may have
contributed to the observed trend shifts for both mortality
rates.
The use of an intervention at the national level in a pro-
spective quasi-experimental design is inherently stronger as
a design than an ex post analysis of archival data on the rela-
tionship of interdependent factors using variants of multiple
regression analysis (Glass, 1997). Nevertheless, it is neces-
sary to consider possible threats to internal validity, namely,
alternative possible causes of the reduction of the stress-
related mortality variables investigated in these studies.
A major societal impact that occurred during the interven-
tion period was the economic recession of 2008-2009 associ-
ated with the subprime mortgage crisis. However, the onset
and duration of this recession (December 2007, with peak
Figure 3. Plot of monthly DFR.
Note. The plot of the monthly rate of drug-related accidental fatalities for August 2002 to December 2010 displays monthly seasonal variation and a rising
trend in the preintervention period followed by a flattening of the trend during the intervention period 2007 through 2010 (see vertical line in the plot).

unemployment in October 2009) does not precisely track the
intervention period. More importantly, the economic stresses
associated with the recession (e.g., unemployment) would be
predicted, if anything, to increase rather than decrease the
stress-related health indicators examined in these studies.
One specific factor to consider in the case of drug-related
deaths is that one might speculate that increased public and
professional awareness of the hazards of opioid analgesics in
recent years might have contributed to a reduction in their
prescription during the intervention period. As outlined in
the introduction, increased used of opioid drugs is consid-
ered to contribute substantially to the rise of DD. However,
data indicate that opioid sales increased throughout the base-
line and intervention period of this research, reaching their
peak in 2011 (Volkow, 2014). Thus, the opioids were becom-
ing more available rather than less available through the
intervention period.
Because of the national scope of measurement of these
studies, and the specificity of the intervention period and
associated changes in mortality rates, a viable alternative
explanation will require almost simultaneous implementa-
tion of a treatment or medical technology or program that
would influence both the variables of these studies and dis-
proportionately affect two different subpopulations of the
United States (higher prevalence for African American
women in the case of IM and for middle-age Whites in the
case of DD). We are unable to think of any such plausible
alternative explanation that would satisfy these two require-
ments. In the absence of plausible alternative explanations,
the significant intervention impacts on both mortality vari-
ables found in this article suggest the possibility of some
underlying connection between individuals who are not
apparently behaviorally connected. As outlined in the intro-
duction to this article, such a connection independent of
behavioral interaction is described as the collective con-
sciousness of society. More specifically, the Vedic tradition
of India identifies collective consciousness as having its
basis in an underlying level of pure consciousness, which is
predicted to be influenced by the intervention examined
here, group practice of the advanced TM-Sidhi program.

An alternative hypothesis affecting generalizability of
the results is whether there is selection bias in the use of
members in the intervention group who were already
experts in the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi
program and may therefore be a special group in terms of
consciousness training. From a theoretical perspective, it is
only necessary that the members of the intervention group
be trained in the advanced TM-Sidhi program to stimulate
the hypothesized field of pure consciousness. It is under-
stood that, as a practical necessity, the individuals who par-
ticipated in this project would be those with some prior
expertise/training to volunteer their time. But, in principle,
for this effect to be created, any group with basic stability,
such as groups of students or the military, could be
employed once trained in the TM-Sidhi program. In some
countries, such groups are being created and future research
will be necessary to confirm their effects.
The result of these studies, if further replicated, provide
government leaders with a potential means to relieve stress
on a large scale in society that is independent of structural
social change and benefits public health. Although social
stress as a mediating variable was not directly measured,
the consistency of the present results with those reported
previously for reduced homicide and violent crime
(Dillbeck & Cavanaugh, 2016) lends support to a hypothe-
sis of such a mediating influence. In light of these results, it
is suggested that when TM-Sidhi groups are established
with government support (most easily, with existing groups,
such as military personnel), the potential impact of such
TM-Sidhi groups be evaluated on stress-related public
health parameters.

6. The effect size f is given by the t ratio (or square root of the
F statistic) for the regression coefficient divided by the square
root of the residual degrees of freedom. The unsquared effect
size metric is reported, rather than squared, because unsquared
measures better indicate the relative magnitude of effects across
variables (Darlington, 1990). The guidelines for large, medium,
and small values of f mentioned above are the square root of
those given by Cohen for f2 (0.35, 0.15, and 0.02, respectively).
7. The estimated change in trend slope of -0.0229146 (before
rounding) gives the estimated reduction in the mathematically
expected value of the monthly infant mortality rate (IMR) for
each month of the intervention period relative to the preinter-
vention trend. Multiplying by 48 months gives -1.100 fatali-
ties per 10,000 live births, the expected value of the cumulative
total change in IMR for 2007 to 2010.
 8. The preintervention data were used to generate monthly fore-
casts of IMR for 2007 to 2010 based on ordinary least squares
(OLS) estimates of Equation 1 after deleting the trend-change
variable DT from the model. The cumulative total number of
fatalities averted for 2007 to 2010 (N

(1990) for smaller samples, the Breusch­Godfrey and all other
Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests reported in Table 2 are given
in their F statistic form rather than chi-square.
10. The bandwidth of four Newey and West (1987) lags was
selected automatically by PcGive 14 using the integer part of
4(N / 100)2/9. Experimentation with a wide range of alternative
bandwidths indicated that the conclusions of the trend shift
analysis are not sensitive to bandwidth.
11. The Robinson periodogram test evaluates the null hypothesis
that the differencing parameter d takes a nonstationary value ver-
sus the alternative of stationarity. In the theoretical framework
underlying this test, both integer and fractional values of d are
permitted, allowing for the possibility of fractional integration,
including possible "long memory" behavior for values of d > 0.
The Robinson test rejects the null hypothesis that the estimated
difference parameter falls in the nonstationary region d  0.5 in
favor of the alternative d < 0.5 (see Table 1), thus supporting
stationarity of the IMR residual series. The sample estimate of
d = -0.2695 indicates stationary "short memory" or "antiper-
sistence," presumably reflecting the predominance of negative
autocorrelations among the largest residual autocorrelations.
12. As discussed in Dillbeck and Cavanaugh (2016), standard
approaches to testing for nonstationarity (unit root tests) such
as the augmented Dickey­Fuller test (Dickey & Fuller, 1979;
Said & Dickey, 1984) and others have been shown to be biased
in favor of concluding that a broken-trend stationary time
series (TS) is nonstationary.
13. Following Zivot and Andrews (1992), we test for nonsta-
tionarity using the "change in growth" broken-trend model
based on Equation 15 in Perron (1989, p. 1381), which is
Model B in Zivot and Andrews (1992, p. 253). The test
statistic has a nonstandard distribution tabulated by Perron
(1989, Table V.B). The critical value for the test depends
on the parameter  = t N
B
/ , the time of the break divided
by total sample size. For the two variables analyzed in this
article,  = 0.51.
14. Because of possible monthly seasonality displayed by IMR, a
maximum of 12 lags of first-differenced IMR were considered
for inclusion in the regression used to calculate the Perron test
statistic. Because superfluous regressors inflate SEs for the
estimated regression coefficients (Greene, 2011), lags that
were not significant at the 20% level (lags 6-10 and 12) were
deleted from the Perron test regression, thus substantially
increasing the power of the Perron test.

, where the SEs for the regression coefficients are 0.3154,
0.00433, and 0.00811, respectively.
16. The SE for the estimate of  reported by PcGive 14 software
is calculated from the SEs of 3
and ( )
 
2 1
- in Equation
2 by numerical differentiation using a nonlinear algorithm
(Bårdsen, 1989; Doornik & Hendry, 2013). As shown by Inder
(1993), t tests for  based on critical values from the standard
normal distribution have both good power and actual p values
close to their nominal level.
17. The long-run, or equilibrium, change in slope -0.0577561
(before rounding) gives the estimated reduction in the math-
ematically expected value of drug-related fatalities per mil-
lion population (DFR) for each month of the intervention
period relative to the preintervention trend. Multiplying
by 48 months gives the expected value of the cumulative
change for 2007 to 2010: -2.7723 monthly fatalities per mil-
lion population.
18. Using preintervention data, the OLS estimate of Equation 2 (with
trend shift variable DT omitted) was used to generate monthly
ex ante (dynamic) forecasts of DFR for 2007 to 2010 (Doornik &
Hendry, 2013). The cumulative total number of averted drug-related
deaths during 2007 through 2010 (N
DD
) was estimated as follows:

where summation is over month k of the intervention and

19. The Robinson test rejects the null hypothesis that the differ-
encing parameter d falls in the nonstationary region d  0.5
in favor of the stationary alternative d < 0.5. The sample esti-
mate of the differencing parameter is d = -0.0232. The null
hypothesis of stationarity, d = 0, also was not rejected, t(61) =
-0.2995, p = .766. All frequency domain tests were estimated
in Stata 14 software employing add-on module roblpr (Baum
& Wiggins, 2000; StataCorp, 2015). The number of periodo-
gram ordinates used in the tests for DFR and IMR was the
default value m = N0.9 (m = 63), where N = 101 is the effective
sample size. The test results were not sensitive to alternative
values of m.
20. As in the case of the Perron test for IMR, lags 1 to 12 of first-
differenced DFR that were not significant at the 20% level
(lags 1 and 4­10) were deleted from the regression equation
for the Perron test, reducing SEs for the remaining regressors
and increasing the power of the test.
